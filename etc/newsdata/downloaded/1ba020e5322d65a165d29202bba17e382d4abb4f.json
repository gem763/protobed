He says that during the raid, U.S. forces flew low and fast, and were met with gunfire at points.\n\nTrump is also suggesting that the footage of the raid may be released publicly so that the world knows al-Baghdadi spent his final moments \u201ccrying, \u201cwhimpering\u201d and \u201cscreaming.\u201d\n\n__\n\n9:40 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel and igniting an explosive vest, killing himself and three of his young children\n\nTrump is describing the U.S. raid in Syria that killed perhaps the world\u2019s most wanted man.\n\nThe president says during remarks from the White House\u2019s Diplomatic Room that al-Baghdadi spent his last moments in utter fear and claims that the IS leader was \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d and died as \u201ca coward, running and crying.\u201d\n\nTrump had teased the announcement with a tweet Saturday night, declaring that \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nHe says the U.S. received immediate and positive identification on the body and that the world is now a much safer place.\n\n___\n\n9:25 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead after a U.S. military operation in Syria targeted the Islamic State group leader.\n\nTrump says in a statement to the nation from the White House\u2019s Diplomatic Room that \u201cal-Baghdadi is dead\u201d \u2014 fulfilling the top national security priority of his administration.\n\nHe says no U.S. personnel were lost in the mission.\n\nAl-Baghdadi presided over IS\u2019s global jihad and became arguably the world\u2019s most wanted man.\n\nThe announcement comes as Trump has been on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism in Washington following the recent pullback of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. Critics fear that move will allow the militant group to regain strength after it had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled\n\n___\n\n8:40 a.m.\n\nA senior Turkish official says that \u201cto the best of my knowledge,\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi arrived at a location in Syria 48 hours before the U.S. military raid that\u2019s believed to have targeted the Islamic State group leader.\n\nThe Turkish official says in a written statement Sunday that there\u2019s been \u201cclose coordination\u201d among relevant parties and that the Turkish military had advanced knowledge of the raid.\n\nTurkey\u2019s army said earlier in a tweet that it had \u201cinformation exchanged and coordination\u201d with U.S. military authorities before the operation.\n\nThe U.S. raid with helicopters took place in the Barisha area north of Idlib city \u2014 a few kilometers from the Turkish border.\n\n___\n\n2:10 a.m.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State group, had a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head.\n\nHe\u2019d kept a low public profile in recent years, releasing only sporadic audio recordings.
