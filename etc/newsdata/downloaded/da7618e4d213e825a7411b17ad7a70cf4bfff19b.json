Tears welled up in the 25-year-old's eyes thinking back to that moment.\n\n\"He just was saying I had a good year and that I had an impact on the team getting here,\" an emotional Hudson said. \"Just a little bit of nice words, I guess, to say as I was coming off.\"\n\nThe Nationals put up seven runs in the first inning to beat the Cardinals 7-4 in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series on Tuesday and sweep them out of the playoffs in unceremonious fashion. St. Louis was outscored 20-6 and never led at any point.\n\n\"We proved \u2014 and this doesn't require advanced sabermetrics \u2014 you have to get a lead to win a game,\" Shildt said. \"We weren't able to do that.\"\n\nHours after the manager said his team \"has always believed in itself\" and will continue to do that, it was like the Cardinals forgot how to play baseball. Hudson didn't have his best stuff but was done in by a succession of baffling errors and defensive blunders from the Cardinals \u2014 the majors' best fielding team during the regular season.\n\n\"Baseball, man,\" second baseman Kolten Wong said. \"When this team is rolling like they're doing, you're trying to stop the damage, keep it close, and things like that happen.\"\n\nThe usually dependable Wong dropped a routine throw from third baseman Tommy Edman. Then, Wong, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and right fielder Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez converged before watching an easy flyball fall between them.\n\nMartinez said, \"It just dropped.\" And it hurt.\n\n\"Both were big plays because it allowed the inning to continue and allowed that crooked number to grow,\" Shildt said.\n\nAll of those plays happened in the first inning. Given their total offensive ineptitude, the Cardinals were down and out less than 20 minutes after the first pitch of the night.\n\nOf course, that continued, too. Washington starter Patrick Corbin became the first pitcher in to strike out 10 in the first four innings of a playoff game. The Cardinals pushed across three runs on two hits in the fifth and threatened in the eighth with the bases loaded but couldn't come all the way back.\n\nAdam Wainwright, who relieved Hudson, felt like this would be a repeat of Game 5 of the NLDS in 2012 when the Cardinals erased an early 6-0 deficit, then rallied in the ninth at Washington to win and move on. That didn't materialize.\n\n\"I would've been really disappointed had we lost that game 7-0,\" Wainwright said. \"We fought back in and had a chance to win the game.\"\n\nThe Cardinals struck out 14 times, all swinging, totaling 48 for the series.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive time out, the Cardinals looked nothing like the team that put up 10 runs in the first inning of Game 5 of the NL Division Series at Atlanta to advance to face Washington. Leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler went 0 for 11 with six strikeouts before being benched, and Nos. 3 and 4 hitters Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna at one point combined to strike out in 10 consecutive at-bats.\n\n\"There's not one thing you can point to,\" Goldschmidt said. \"I didn't play well enough to help us win. One hit in four games, that's not going to cut it when you're hitting third. It just came back to bite us.\"\n\nWhen the losses piled up, the explanation kept changing.\n\nAfter crediting Nationals starters for their wizardry through the first two games, the Cardinals lamented not having a lead after they went down quietly in Game 3. St. Louis didn't hold a lead for a single pitch of the NLCS and was swept for just the third time in franchise history.\n\n\"We just give our best out there,\" Martinez said, \"and we couldn't do it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
