Last year they welcomed their baby son Jesse (pictured)\n\nDevastated by her father's death from mouth and throat cancer aged 52, she had already given up on becoming a mum.

'Technically speaking I was pregnant, I had a fertilised egg inside me, it was just waiting to see if it would take.\n\n'I'd never wanted children until I met Andy. Then when they told me I couldn't, I thought, \"I'll show you!\"'\n\nSadly, however, the IVF failed, giving the couple a harsh 'reality check' - indicating just how difficult falling pregnant was going to be.\n\nGiven daily hormone injections to encourage her body to produce viable eggs, after 10 days Cli had her eggs extracted. They were then fertilised in the fertility lab using Andy's sperm, before being implanted back into her womb, after which they waited for a nail biting two weeks before taking a pregnancy test.

So, after nine months on the waiting list, in June 2016, Cli had another of her eggs fertilised by Andy's sperm at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. Pictured: Baby Jesse\n\nCli explained: 'You think IVF is simple and that the doctors are doing all the hard work for you and it's going to work.\n\n'Of course, that couldn't be further from the truth and we learnt that the hard way.'\n\nStill determined to stay hopeful, the couple decided to go for NHS-funded IVF treatment and try again.\n\nSo, after nine months on the waiting list, in June 2016, Cli had another of her eggs fertilised by Andy's sperm at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.\n\n'It was the exact same process as the previous time, but I was less hopeful,' she explained.\n\n'I'd only been able to produce one viable egg this time and I couldn't help feeling from the get go that the odds were stacked against us.\n\nDigging into their savings once more for the \u00a313,000 they needed, Cli and Andy visited the fertility clinic, Sims IVF, in Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland, after hearing of friends who had twins after going there. Pictured: Andy and baby Jesse\n\nCli spoke candidly about the difficulty of getting pregnant and how it's a lot of hard work\n\n'When we found out the pregnancy hadn't taken it was still sad, though. I guess a part of you hopes your body will work in weird and wonderful ways and it will all work out.'\n\nThen, three months later, in September 2016, Cli was dealt another devastating blow, when her father broke the news he was dying of mouth and throat cancer.\n\nShe continued: 'I remember thinking that if I could get pregnant, a grandchild would give my dad so much more to fight for.\n\n'That's when I knew we had to try IVF again.'\n\nDigging into their savings once more for the \u00a313,000 they needed, Cli and Andy visited the fertility clinic, Sims IVF, in Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland, after hearing of friends who had twins after going there.\n\nFollowing an initial consultation in November 2016, Cli had hoped to be pregnant in time for Christmas, but the procedure was pushed back to February 2017 to give her body 'time to recover' (pictured while pregnant)\n\nJust two months after their third failed IVF attempt, Cli was left heartbroken again when her father passed away from cancer on April 23, 2017. 'I told him about the failed IVF and he was really upset,' she said. 'He was so determined he would do whatever it took for us to have our baby.' And, true to his word, Jim left his daughter \u00a315,000 specifically for one last shot at IVF.

And, following further tests, they found the embryo fertilised with Andy's sperm was the most viable, so this was the one they used to proceed. Pictured, Andy, Cli and Jesse's matching shoes\n\nCli, ictured with her son, Jesse. She said that although she's not religious, she believes her late father helped her to become a mother from beyond the grave\n\n'It was hard,' Cli said. 'Every time we'd see a child on the street we'd cry. We ended up drowning our sorrows a fair few times.'\n\nJust two months after their third failed IVF attempt, Cli was left heartbroken again when her father passed away from cancer on April 23, 2017.\n\n'I told him about the failed IVF and he was really upset,' she said.

'I got up in the morning at 5am and I did the test and it said it was inconclusive and I told Andy and he wouldn't believe it,' she said.\n\n'We'd spent years focusing on having a baby, so we decided to focus on having two weeks of fun instead, before getting things started,' she said.\n\n'The clinic suggested using a sperm donor as a back-up plan this time.\n\n'They also suggested Andy go on a course of Proceive fertility supplements to boost his sperm count.'\n\nThree months later, in February 2018, doctors fertilised five of Cli's eggs - three from donor sperm and two from Andy's sperm.\n\nAnd, following further tests, they found the embryo fertilised with Andy's sperm was the most viable, so this was the one they used to proceed.\n\nThis time, during the dreaded two week wait for news, Cli was certain the pregnancy would take, saying: 'I just knew that Dad would not allow me not to fall pregnant.\n\nFollowing a 'scary few weeks,' with some minor bleeding, Cli looked on course to have a healthy pregnancy.

'I got up in the morning at 5am and I did the test and it said it was inconclusive and I told Andy and he wouldn't believe it,' she said.\n\n'I told him it hadn't worked but he wouldn't believe it and 10 minutes later I did another test and it showed the same thing.\n\n'But then Andy had another look and it had worked, as soon as he told me we burst into tears, jumping up and down on the bed.\n\n'It was so early in the morning we couldn't even tell our nearest and dearest but that one moment - seeing it positive - blew our minds. 'It was absolutely amazing and we were so happy,'\n\nFollowing a 'scary few weeks,' with some minor bleeding, Cli looked on course to have a healthy pregnancy.\n\nReturning to work last week after marking Jesse's first birthday, Cli says she is perfectly content be the mum of just one cheeky little chap\n\nDiscussing further IVF treatment down the line, she said: 'I couldn't put myself through all that again'\n\nAnd on October 10, 2018, Jesse was born by emergency C-section, after Cli's waters broke five and a half weeks early, at Ulster Hospital, in County Down, Northern Ireland.\n\n'We were a bit worried because he was a few weeks premature, but he was born fit and healthy,' she said.\n\n'It's been brilliant ever since and there have been no issues whatsoever.\n\n'I know I've got to say this but he really is fantastic. He's the most gorgeous boy.'\n\nReturning to work last week after marking Jesse's first birthday, Cli says she is perfectly content be the mum of just one cheeky little chap.\n\n'We've been through so much to get where we are now but I wouldn't change a thing.
