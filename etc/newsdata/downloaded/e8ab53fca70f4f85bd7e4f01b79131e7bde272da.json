It is also inexpensive and, according to top chefs, delicious, to ask for unusual cuts of the animal.\n\nWhile \"nose-to-tail\" eating with mammals became popular decades ago, and many would not think twice about eating a liver from a lamb or a goose, most do not think the same way about fish.\n\nSupermarkets are beginning to realise people no longer want \"perfect\" food and are happy to shop sustainably, with the \"wonky veg\" trend taking off in recent years. At Waitrose and Tesco, you can find smoked salmon trimmings, and Waitrose also sells off-cuts of monkfish for curries.\n\nHowever, it is restaurants and fishmongers where you will find the most unusual parts of the fish.\n\nAt Kiln, a busy Thai restaurant in Soho, London, chefs use monkfish livers to enrich sauces and infuse flavour into shellfish dishes by using lobster heads.\n\nHead chef Meedu Saad told the Sunday Telegraph: \"We believe in using the entire product, as much as is possible. We use lobster head meat as it is delicious and it adds both texture and flavour to the dish.\n\n\"We also put monkfish liver in our monkfish curry to add richness and constistency to the curry. The fat gives you a really velvety texture.\n\nThose eating a whole fish at the restaurant may have questions about the delicious paste which is stuffed inside the animal. It is actually offal - Mr Saad explained: \"We tend to take the innards of our fish pound them through curry paste and put them back into the fish and it adds fat. We use the innards as fat instead of oil and butter and it gives a more complex flavour to the fish.\"", "description": "Fish tongues, livers and fins are on the menus of some of the country's finest chefs in a new sustainable eating trend.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Daniel Hannan", "Erin Baker", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/fish-heads-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4YSnuoebJVzqhPY-8ji1g-2Oe43N7tarmWi1lq693u8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
