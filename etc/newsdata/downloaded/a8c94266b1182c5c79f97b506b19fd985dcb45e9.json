When asked how that felt, she noted that at first it was surprising to realize so few women had won the award: \u201cBut, I mean, I do live in a world of mostly men, so seeing mostly men doesn\u2019t really ever surprise me either.\u201d\n\nThe rarity of female Nobel laureates raises questions about women\u2019s exclusion from education and careers in science. Female researchers have come a long way over the past century. But there\u2019s overwhelming evidence that women remain underrepresented in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nStudies have shown those who persist in these careers face explicit and implicit barriers to advancement. Bias is most intense in fields that are predominantly male, where women lack a critical mass of representation and are often viewed as tokens or outsiders.\n\nWhen women achieve at the highest levels of sports, politics, medicine and science, they serve as role models for everyone \u2013 especially for girls and other women.\n\nAs things are getting better in terms of equal representation, what still holds women back in the lab, in leadership and as award winners?\n\nGood news at the start of the pipeline\n\nTraditional stereotypes hold that women \u201cdon\u2019t like math\u201d and \u201caren\u2019t good at science.\u201d Both men and women report these viewpoints, but researchers have empirically disputed them. Studies show that girls and women avoid STEM education not because of cognitive inability, but because of early exposure and experience with STEM, educational policy, cultural context, stereotypes and a lack of exposure to role models.\n\nFor the past several decades, efforts to improve the representation of women in STEM fields have focused on countering these stereotypes with educational reforms and individual programs that can increase the number of girls entering and staying in what\u2019s been called the STEM pipeline \u2013 the path from K-12 to college to postgraduate training.\n\nThese approaches are working. Women are increasingly likely to express an interest in STEM careers and pursue STEM majors in college. Women now make up half or more of workers in psychology and social sciences and are increasingly represented in the scientific workforce, though computer and mathematical sciences are an exception.\n\nAccording to the American Institute of Physics, women earn about 20 percent of bachelor\u2019s degrees and 18 percent of Ph.D.s in physics, an increase from 1975 when women earned 10 percent of bachelor\u2019s degrees and 5 percent of Ph.D.s in physics.\n\nMore women are graduating with STEM Ph.D.s and earning faculty positions. But they encounter glass cliffs and ceilings as they advance through their academic careers.\n\nWhat\u2019s not working for women\n\nWomen face a number of structural and institutional barriers in academic STEM careers.\n\nIn addition to issues related to the gender pay gap, the structure of academic science often makes it difficult for women to get ahead in the workplace and to balance work and life commitments. Bench science can require years of dedicated time in a laboratory. The strictures of the tenure-track process can make maintaining work-life balance, responding to family obligations and having children or taking family leave difficult, if not impossible.\n\nAdditionally, working in male-dominated workplaces can leave women feeling isolated, perceived as tokens and susceptible to harassment. Women often are excluded from networking opportunities and social events, left to feel they\u2019re outside the culture of the lab, the academic department and the field.\n\nWhen women lack a critical mass in a workplace \u2013 making up about 15 percent or more of workers \u2013 they are less empowered to advocate for themselves and more likely to be perceived as a minority group and an exception. When in this minority position, women are more likely to be pressured to take on extra service as tokens on committees or mentors to female graduate students.\n\nWith fewer female colleagues, women are less likely to build relationships with female collaborators and support and advice networks. This isolation can be exacerbated when women are unable to participate in work events or attend conferences because of family or child care responsibilities and an inability to use research funds to reimburse child care.\n\nUniversities, professional associations and federal funders have worked to address a variety of these structural barriers. Efforts include creating family-friendly policies, increasing transparency in salary reporting, enforcing Title IX protections, providing mentoring and support programs for women scientists, protecting research time for women scientists and targeting women for hiring, research support and advancement. These programs have mixed results.\n\nFor example, research indicates that family-friendly policies such as leave and onsite child care can exacerbate gender inequity, resulting in increased research productivity for men and increased teaching and service obligations for women.\n\nPeople haven\u2019t really updated their mental images of what a scientist looks like since Wilhelm Roentgen won the first physics Nobel in 1901. Wellcome Collection, CC BY\n\nImplicit biases about who does science\n\nAll of us \u2013 the general public, the media, university employees, students and professors \u2013 have ideas of what a scientist and a Nobel Prize winner looks like. That image is predominantly male, white and older \u2013 which makes sense given 97 percent of the science Nobel Prize winners have been men.\n\nThis is an example of an implicit bias: one of the unconscious, involuntary, natural, unavoidable assumptions that all of us \u2013 men and women \u2013 form about the world. People make decisions based on subconscious assumptions, preferences and stereotypes \u2013 sometimes even when they are counter to their explicitly held beliefs.\n\nResearch shows that an implicit bias against women as experts and academic scientists is pervasive. It manifests itself by valuing, acknowledging and rewarding men\u2019s scholarship over women\u2019s scholarship.\n\nImplicit bias can work against women\u2019s hiring, advancement and recognition of their work. For instance, women seeking academic jobs are more likely to be viewed and judged based on personal information and physical appearance. Letters of recommendation for women are more likely to raise doubts and use language that results in negative career outcomes.\n\nImplicit bias can affect women\u2019s ability to publish research findings and gain recognition for that work. Men cite their own papers 56 percent more than women do. Known as the \u201cMatilda Effect,\u201d there is a gender gap in recognition, award-winning and citations.\n\nWomen\u2019s research is less likely to be cited by others, and their ideas are more likely to be attributed to men. Women\u2019s solo-authored research takes twice as long to move through the review process. Women are underrepresented in journal editorships, as senior scholars and lead authors and as peer reviewers. This marginalization in research gatekeeping positions works against the promotion of women\u2019s research.\n\nWhen a woman becomes a world-class scientist, implicit bias works against the likelihood that she will be invited as a keynote or guest speaker to share her research findings, thus lowering her visibility in the field and the likelihood that she will be nominated for awards. This gender imbalance is notable in how infrequently women experts are quoted in news stories on most topics.\n\nWomen scientists are afforded less of the respect and recognition that should come with their accomplishments. Research shows that when people talk about male scientists and experts, they\u2019re more likely to use their surnames and more likely to refer to women by their first names.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because experiments show that individuals referred to by their surnames are more likely to be viewed as famous and eminent. In fact, one study found that calling scientists by their last names led people to consider them 14 percent more deserving of a National Science Foundation career award.\n\nSeeing mostly men has been the history of science. Addressing structural and implicit bias in STEM will hopefully prevent another half-century wait before the next woman is acknowledged with a Nobel Prize for her contribution to physics. I look forward to the day when a woman receiving the most prestigious award in science is newsworthy only for her science and not her gender.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published on Oct. 5, 2018.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Mary K.
