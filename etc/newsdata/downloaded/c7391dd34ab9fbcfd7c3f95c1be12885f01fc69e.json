Tulsi Gabbard at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, August 10, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)\n\nLong-shot presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), confirmed her participation in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate on Twitter Monday, after threatening last week to boycott the event entirely over concern that \u201cthe DNC and corporate media are rigging the election again.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who is currently polling at 0.7 percent nationally, addressed supporters Thursday and accused the Democratic National Committee and corporate media partners of attempting \u201cto usurp your role as voters in choosing who our Democratic nominee will be.\u201d\n\nGabbard also clashed with the DNC in the buildup to September\u2019s debate, after falling two polls short of the pre-approved public support threshold. Gabbard and her campaign argued that the standards were arbitrary, and suggested the \u201clack of transparency\u201d pointed to an overarching problem of prioritizing the preferences of political elites over those of ordinary voters.\n\nGabbard managed to hit both the donor and poll criteria for Tuesday\u2019s debate, making her the 12th Democratic candidate to qualify.\n\nWhile a majority of the candidates have participated in the recent town halls on gun violence and LGBT issues in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, respectively, Gabbard has remained on the campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire. During an interview with Hill.TV on Friday, she said her decision was being made \u201cvery carefully,\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m listening to a lot of the feedback that we\u2019re getting from supporters and just thinking through all of the ramifications of this decision,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cWhat it really comes down to is how best to make an impact to bring about this change.\u201d\n\nAfter a New York Times weekend profile highlighted alleged links between Gabbard and the alt-right, the Hawaii congresswoman took to Twitter to illustrate her critique of the system.\n\nAs if to prove my point, NYT just published a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d smear piece. All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the \u201cneutral\u201d questioners/moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 12, 2019", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard confirmed her participation in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate on Twitter Monday, after threatening last week to boycott the event.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
