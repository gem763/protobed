This time will want detail.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission conducted an inquiry into mortgage pricing as recently as last year. Now Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has asked it to do another, broader one, in order to ensure the banks\u2019 pricing practices are \u201cbetter understood\u201d, and perhaps also to concentrate their minds on the wisdom of fully passing on the next collection of rate cuts.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to better understand.\n\nThe last inquiry found that the banks used \u201copaque pricing\u201d that \u201cstifled\u201d competition and made it hard for borrowers to shop around, both when looking for a new mortgage and when considering switching from one they had.\n\nSeven in ten of the borrowers surveyed for the inquiry said they had obtained only one quote before taking out their residential mortgage.\n\nThe inquiry concluded the big four \u201cprofit from the suppression of borrower incentives to shop around.\u201d\n\nSo, what else is there to find out?\n\nThis time, the inquiry is being conducted under Part VIIA of the Competition and Consumer Act, meaning the the ACCC can use compulsory information-gathering powers.\n\nI reckon there are four big questions it ought to be asking.\n\nQuestion 1: Are bank profits super-profits?\n\nThe inquiry isn\u2019t specifically asked to examine banks\u2019 profits, but the question of whether their profits are unreasonably large (so-called super-profits) lies behind questions about whether they are charging more than they should.\n\nIt turns out that the big four banks\u2019 profit ratios have not shot up egregiously over the past few years. Their returns on equity are high, much higher than those of banks in other developed countries, but have not been increasing.\n\nWhile data for the most recent year is not yet available, it looks as if banks have not been dramatically ramping up their profit seeking behaviour and may have suffered declines.\n\nReturn on equity, the big four", "description": "The ACCC has inquired into mortgage rates before.
