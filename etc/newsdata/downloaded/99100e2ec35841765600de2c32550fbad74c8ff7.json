Twelve years ago last week the World Cup enjoyed \u2013 or endured, depending on the colour of your shirt \u2013 one of its greatest shocks.\n\nThe day the Fijians went fishing, and caught a whale.\n\nAhead of Wales\u2019 latest World Cup match against Fiji on Wednesday Sportsmail caught up with three men who played in the iconic match of 2007 \u2013 which knocked the Welsh out of the tournament and led to the appointment of Warren Gatland.\n\nWales were knocked out of the 2007 Rugby World Cup after a shock loss to Fiji in France\n\nWales\u2019 preparation for the tournament was poor.\n\nTom Shanklin (Wales centre in 2007): 'In the Six Nations we beat England, and that was it. Then we had them in a warm-up game, and got hammered up front. Nick Easter scored four tries and we only scored one in the second half.\n\n'It was embarrassing. All we did all day was tackle, and that\u2019s no fun. Then we had Argentina and France. We beat Argentina, which brought back a little bit of confidence.'\n\nThe coach was Gareth Jenkins \u2013 a popular man among the players.\n\nTS: 'I loved him. His whole demeanour. He was a great bloke, we had so much fun. Little things tickled you all the time.\n\n'A reporter would ask me a question in a press conference and Gareth thought it was for him and would answer for me. He\u2019d get my name wrong too, calling me my dad\u2019s name Jim as he grew up watching him play!'\n\nWales were at a French World Cup but played two matches \u2013 against Australia and Japan \u2013 in Cardiff.\n\nTS: 'I can\u2019t believe they let us play at home! It gave us an unfair advantage\u2026 although it didn\u2019t matter as we lost to Australia anyway! It didn\u2019t really feel like a World Cup as we came back to Cardiff for two weeks.'\n\nWales' Tom Shanklin was a fan of coach Gareth Jenkins despite how it turned out in 2007\n\nBut when in France they enjoyed it. The week of the Fiji game the 2007 squad had a big night out.\n\nTS: 'We went to Longchamp Races for a black-tie event. All of a sudden 20 Welsh lads come in wearing ripped jeans and Superdry T-Shirts asking for 20 sambucas!\n\n'Not everyone went \u2013 but we had a couple of days off so went for a team bonding session. In the back of our mind it was Fiji; In 2007 they didn\u2019t carry the weight they do now.'\n\nNicky Little (Fiji fly-half in 2007): 'If you look past your opponent the rugby gods won\u2019t like that!'\n\nFor Fiji and Wales it was a do-or-die match \u2013 win and into the quarter-finals, lose and out.\n\nNL: 'We weren\u2019t playing for survival, we were playing for a positive end. That\u2019s why the boys did well \u2013 we don\u2019t care about much at all \u2013 win the game and then it\u2019s onto something else. The mentality was easier.'\n\nNantes was bouncing.\n\nNL: 'The atmosphere was awesome. When Fijians play humbly and honestly we\u2019re everyone\u2019s favourite second team \u2013 even if you\u2019re English, Welsh or a Kiwi \u2013 as it\u2019s the way we play.\n\n'Us old boys always giggle, we didn\u2019t want to win kicking the ball, we wanted to win looking good!'\n\nShane Williams scores a try against Fiji in Nantes, leaving defenders in his wake\n\nOn Gareth Thomas\u2019 100th cap things went badly wrong very quickly for Wales \u2013 Akapusi Qera, Vilimoni Delasau and Kele Leawere all scored and Fiji led 25-3 after just 25 minutes.\n\nTS: 'That Delasau try\u2026 how on earth did the ball bounce like that!? Twice! It came from Seru Rabeni, who was at Leicester and has since sadly died, the ball was kicked forward and then bounced right into Delasau\u2019s hands having bounced over Mark Jones and Gareth Thomas\u2019 heads.\n\n'You look back and think the stars were aligned for them!'\n\nNL: 'It felt unreal. We were up by so much and I thought \u201cman, they\u2019re going to be angry!\u201d \u2013 they were and they whipped us! I was then angry because when we are ahead as Fijians we get too relaxed and confident.'\n\nStephen Jones (Wales fly-half in 2007): 'It highlighted what Fijian rugby is all about. Give them space and time and they move the ball well have an offloading game and put you under pressure. They did that day and scored some wonderful tries.'\n\nThe backlash came. Wales rallied as Alix Popham, Shane Williams \u2013 from 60 metres out \u2013 Gareth Thomas and Mark Jones all scored. And when Little threw and intercept to Martyn Williams, who raced in, it looked like Wales\u2019 game.\n\nNL: 'I\u2019d rather win by 40 points so you\u2019re secure! I guess it was a good game to watch though. As a player you don\u2019t want to be in those games.'\n\nTS: 'Nothing was really working, they weren\u2019t folding, were full of energy\u2026 and then Martyn Williams took an intercept. You think \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s it, their heads will drop\u201d \u2013 but it didn\u2019t happen. They picked and went and eventually scored near the end.'\n\nWith Graham Dewes\u2019 76th minute close-range try Fiji went back ahead 38-34, and clung on for the famous win which knocked Wales out.\n\nFiji's players celebrate after stunning Wales - they progressed to the quarter-finals instead\n\nNL: 'I busted a knee with two minutes to go so I was in underneath the stadium in the first-aid room when the game finished. Our doctor was a big man \u2013 he could bench-press 400kgs (62st)!\n\n'I was a bit out of it because they\u2019d given me morphine. The doctor ran into the medical room, the doors smashed open and he said \u201cWe did it boy!\u201d\n\n'My wife was hysterical watching the game live in a London pub with all her mates, as she was not happy I\u2019d been taken off. I called her from the ambulance and she was freaking out.'\n\nSJ: 'It was a huge disappointment, when you get knocked out in the group-stages.'\n\nTS: 'Everyone was shattered as it was such a fast-paced game. We went through a lot of emotions \u2013 up, down, in, out.\n\n'But the realisation hit us that we were out on that final whistle, and a bit of embarrassment too. Honestly I don\u2019t believe we were complacent. I was gutted but it was great for Fiji.'\n\nWales coach Gareth Jenkins (L) was sacked, paving the way for Warren Gatland to take charge\n\nFiji went on to lose to the eventual champions South Africa in the quarters. Jenkins was unceremoniously sacked the day after Wales\u2019 loss, but the result heralded a new prosperous decade under Gatland.\n\nNL: 'As Fijians we\u2019re not really win at all costs people \u2013 it\u2019s like gambling, when the fun stops, stop!'\n\nTS: 'It was brutal. Gareth was let go the next day and we flew back, heads down, devastated. We were embarrassed. We were the better team, better off financially than Fiji and were out.\n\n'We got the bus back from the airport to the hotel and just before we got there Gareth got off, said \u201cthanks for everything, it wasn\u2019t meant to be\u201d \u2013 the last we saw of him for a while.\n\nAfter 12 years in charge, Warren Gatland steps down as Wales boss after the 2019 World Cup\n\n'He didn\u2019t want to face the media. He walked down the road to his car and left.'\n\n'Everything happens for a reason\u2026 there was a review and the WRU found Warren Gatland. Had that Fiji game not happened we potentially wouldn\u2019t have had him as the head coach for 11 years!\n\n'If you\u2019re brutally honest you\u2019d say we became stronger for it.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY WILL KELLEHER: A day for disaster and delight.
