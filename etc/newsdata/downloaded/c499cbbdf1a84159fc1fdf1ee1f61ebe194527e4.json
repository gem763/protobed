A great Beaujolais year? I\u2019d bet most oenophiles couldn\u2019t name one.\n\nIn fact, the years 2015-2018 were all very good Beaujolais years. \u201cWe have been lucky to have four good vintages in a row,\u201d noted Gregory Barbet, managing director of Domaine de la Pirolette in the Beaujolais village of Saint-Amour.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t more wine drinkers taken note? The top Beaujolais crus have plenty in common with their Burgundy peers; Beaujolais is, after all, a subregion of Burgundy. The fact that these very good wines are usually much cheaper than comparable ones from other regions in Burgundy means they\u2019re often great value\u2014and often underestimated as well.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you tried Beaujolais? And no, we don\u2019t mean Nouveau! Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Barbet\u2019s family is one of the oldest and best-known names in Beaujolais. They co-own two other important estates, too: Domaine des Billards in Saint-Amour and Ch\u00e2teau de Fleurie in Fleurie.\n\nSaint-Amour and Fleurie are among the 10 Beaujolais crus\u2014the appellations that produce serious wines that have nothing to do with the faddish product of barely fermented juice called Beaujolais Nouveau. These range widely in size and soil type as well as styles of wine produced. Saint-Amour wines are often flamboyantly fruity in their youth, while Fleurie wines have lovely floral aromas (the village\u2019s name means \u201cflowery\u201d). The wines from Morgon are rich and substantial; those from Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, more structured and tannic.\n\nIn an effort to drive Beaujolais Nouveau from the world stage (or at least a bit closer to the curtains) and further emphasize the importance of its crus, Inter Beaujolais, the wine trade council, recently changed \u201cBeaujolais Nouveau Day\u201d to \u201cBeaujolais Day.\u201d Instead of celebrating the day that Beaujolais Nouveau wines arrive in the market\u2014traditionally the third Thursday of November\u2014now all Beaujolais wines will be heralded.\n\nThough any Beaujolais is also Burgundian, oenophiles commonly reserve the latter term for certain long-lived Beaujolais crus like Moulin-\u00e0-Vent and Morgon. It implies complexity and structure rarely associated with Gamay, the red grape of Beaujolais.\n\nComplex is certainly the word for wines from Jean Foillard, whose rich, multilayered 2017 Jean Foillard Cuv\u00e9e Corcelette Morgon ($38) could command twice the price if it was produced in a different Burgundy zone. The friends I gathered recently to taste Beaujolais with me loved the Foillard\u2014but when I told them the price, they balked. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Beaujolais costs,\u201d said one. To her, Beaujolais should be \u201calways under $20 a bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s a vintage the famously exacting Jean-Paul Brun declared \u201cperfect.\u201d\u2019 \u201d\n\nBrian Lynch, the Berkeley, Calif.-based national sales director of Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant, observed that it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d to him that consumers only recognize prestige in certain regions. \u201cYou can buy the best wines from the Beaujolais for under $50,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIn how many regions does $50 allow you to drink wines from the best crus and from the best producers?\u201d\n\nJoe Salamone, wine buyer for Crush Wines & Spirits in New York, said that while many wine drinkers are like my friends, he\u2019s also finding more willing to spend money on a good cru Beaujolais. He posited that a rise in prices has been a boon to their reputation. \u201cSometimes you have to be somewhat expensive to convince people that you are worth paying for,\u201d he noted in an email.\n\nAccording to Mr. Lynch, prices of Beaujolais crus imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant have increased by 1-4% in each of the past four vintages, \u201cconsistent with all the quality producers in Beaujolais.\u201d\n\nOne superstar Beaujolais estate in the Kermit Lynch portfolio, Ch\u00e2teau Thivin, turns out Beaujolais-Villages as well as several wines from the Brouilly and C\u00f4te de Brouilly crus. I purchased three: the 2017 Ch\u00e2teau Thivin C\u00f4te de Brouilly Cuv\u00e9e Godefroy ($35), the 2017 Ch\u00e2teau Thivin C\u00f4te de Brouilly La Chapelle ($30) and the 2018 Ch\u00e2teau Thivin C\u00f4te de Brouilly ($24). Marked by complex aromas of red fruit, spice and earth, the Godefroy was particularly opulent and lush. The La Chapelle, initially a bit tight, bloomed in the glass. The 2018 C\u00f4te de Brouilly was beautifully balanced, substantial yet polished.\n\nLater I discovered the first two are not officially available in the States. According to Anthony Lynch, son of importer Kermit Lynch, both wines are made from small parcels of very old vines and sold only in France (apart from a few bottles I found at Crush Wine & Spirits). The 2018 C\u00f4te de Brouilly, however, is widely distributed stateside.\n\nI had quite a few very good 2017 Beaujolais crus, including a delightful 2017 Daniel Bouland Chiroubles Chatenay ($24), all snappy red cherry fruit, and the 2017 Domaine des Billards Saint-Amour, bright and juicy and, at $18 a bottle, priced at a point my friends would happily pay; the marvelously plump and fruity 2017 Ch\u00e2teau de Fleurie Fleurie went for the same price. The 2017 Jean-Paul Brun Domaine des Terres Dor\u00e9es Fleurie ($22) was more darkly fruited and more structured.\n\nI found a few 2018 wines as well, though bottles from this vintage are just arriving in the market and are currently less plentiful than 2017 Beaujolais. There were two 2018 wines of note from Jean-Louis Dutraive, one of the most highly regarded Beaujolais producers, who makes wines in both Brouilly and Fleurie. The two I tasted were both from Fleurie: the 2018 Domaine de la Grand\u2019Cour Cuv\u00e9e Vieilles Vignes Fleurie ($42) and the 2018 Domaine de la Grand\u2019Cour \u201cClos de la Grand\u2019Cour\u201d Fleurie ($38). Both were very well made. The Vieilles Vignes bottling was more complex, richer and more substantial; it could use a bit more time in the bottle. The Clos de la Grand\u2019Cour was fresh and vivid with red fruit aromas that practically burst from the glass.\n\nPerhaps when all the 2018 cru Beaujolais hit store shelves in the next several weeks, wine drinkers will finally take note. It\u2019s a vintage the famously exacting Jean-Paul Brun declared \u201cperfect.\u201d And if oenophiles have to pay a few dollars above what they think the wines \u201cshould\u201d cost, take my word, these wines are worth even more.\n\nOENOFILE / BEAUTIFUL, QUAFFABLE, NOTABLY AFFORDABLE BEAUJOLAIS\n\nPhoto: F.
