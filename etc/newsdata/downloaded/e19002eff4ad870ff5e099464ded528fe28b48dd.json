With this new round, less than six months later, it's now valued at $3.2 billion. That's an increase in value of something like $5 million per day in between the two announcements.\n\nCanva cofounder and CEO Melanie Perkins told Business Insider that the Australian startup has taken an \"atypical\" approach to fundraising by closing smaller amounts across more funding rounds to avoid dilution.\n\nThe startup also announced a new, paid feature for business users, which lets the marketing departments set restrictions on elements like font, color, and templates, to ensure a unified look across the company's communications. It also added tools to help business users manage graphic design projects, including deadlines and feedback.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nJust 148 days after closing its $70 million Series D, graphic design startup Canva raised another $85 million in a brand new Series E round of funding.\n\nThe new deal comes with a valuation of $3.2 billion \u2014 up from $2.5 billion from that last funding five months ago. Some napkin math shows that this means the Australian startup's valuation gained something like $5 million per day in between the two announcements.\n\nWednesday's round was led by Mary Meeker's growth investment firm Bond Capital, which also led Canva's Series D in May. This round also included participation from General Catalyst and Sequoia China, as well as other investors including Bessemer Venture Partners and Blackbird Ventures.\n\nPerkins says that a big part of the reason for all this fundraising is simply the amount of inbound interest from investors. Wednesday's round brings Canva's fundraising total to almost $252.5 million, according to Pitchbook data. That capital is important to helping the company grow, she says \u2014 but there's a strategy to raising so frequently, with only relatively small upticks in the valuation each time.\n\n\"We've taken an atypical approach to raising funds,\" Canva cofounder and CEO Melanie Perkins told Business Insider. \"Rather than taking a large raise at each round, we've taken a lot smaller raise at each step. Our philosophy has been, because we want to build a big company, we are taking smaller dilution.\"\n\nRead More: Silicon Valley's founder-led startups have lost their shine with IPO investors. But the obsession with direct listings won't fix the bigger problem.\n\nCanva, one of Australia's most prominent tech startups, built its multi-billion-dollar business on creative tools for freelance, professional, and aspiring designers. The startup's free products include templates for everything from business cards to social media graphics and have skyrocketed in popularity with in-house creative and marketing teams, Perkins said.\n\nTo go with the new funding, the startup also announced a new, paid feature for business users, which lets the marketing departments set restrictions on elements like font, color, and templates, to ensure a unified look across the company's communications.\n\nThe new feature also includes tools to help business users manage their graphic design projects, including deadlines and feedback \u2014 bringing it a little closer to productivity tools like Asana and Figma.\n\nThose kinds of tools have been a hot topic for startups and investors alike after the breakout successes of apps like Slack, Trello, Asana, and Zoom. Slack and Zoom, especially, found their success with a so-called freemium model. They offer a free version to get power users and early adopters within a company hooked, and then offer lucrative subscriptions for when the IT department is ready to roll it out to the rest of the company.\n\nThis kind of bottoms-up approach to enterprise sales has proven to work well for cloud software companies like Slack and Zoom, and Canva says that it's following a similar path \u2014 with a free version that gets users in the door, and paid features to put it to work.\n\n\"It's very similar to Slack,\" Perkins said of Canva's approach to monetization. \"We have viral growth already within the organization, so now we will enable all those people to collaborate as a team while catering to those needs like single sign on and brand control that companies need.\"", "description": "The startup saw its valuation balloon $700 million to $3.2 billion in just 148 days, which comes out to about $5 million per day.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da61fc0cc4a0a2d7963463d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
