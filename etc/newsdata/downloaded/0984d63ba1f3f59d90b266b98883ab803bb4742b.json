(AP) - Aaron Rodgers loves playing on Monday night.\n\nGrowing up in Northern California, Rodgers would watch the long-running \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games, hum the theme song and dream of being a part of the prime-time show.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re also a lover of the game and historian of the game, and you grew up watching Frank (Gifford), Al (Michaels) and Dan (Dierdorf) on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019, and John Madden and Al Michaels on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019, and Dennis Miller when he was there, and you\u2019re loving the history of the opportunity to play on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019, it\u2019s a special thing,\u201d said the two-time NFL MVP.\n\nRodgers will take the prime-time \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d stage for the 16th time in his career when the Packers (4-1) face their NFC North division foe Detroit Lions (2-1-1) at Lambeau Field, where Green Bay has won six of its past eight Monday night games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun playing at home. Obviously, it\u2019s better,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt\u2019s long days Sunday and Monday, for sure, and a short week the following week, but it is always special to play on \u2018Monday Night Football.\u2019\u201d\n\nRodgers has thrown for 300-plus yards and achieved a passer rating of at least 100 in four consecutive Monday night starts (all Packers wins). That\u2019s the longest streak in the history of the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d franchise.\n\nIn those four games, Rodgers has completed 66.0 percent of his passes, averaged 349.5 passing yards, and thrown 12 touchdowns against zero interceptions for a 120.1 passer rating.\n\nBut Rodgers is only 7-8 on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in his career and his 3-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio on Monday night lags far behind his career 4.25 mark.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re as old as I am and you\u2019ve played in this league for so long, you really do enjoy the noon Sunday games,\u201d said the 35-year-old quarterback. \u201cBased on the schedule, it allows you to kind of get into a weekly rhythm.\u201d\n\nRodgers will be without his top target in receiver Davante Adams, who will be inactive for the second straight week with a turf toe injury.\n\n\u201cWe are really just trying to pace it at this point,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI can\u2019t really tell you when I\u2019m going to play. I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t feel how I want it to feel at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe good news for Rodgers is center Corey Linsley has cleared concussion protocol and is expected to play Monday. Linsley, who hasn\u2019t missed a game since 2016, suffered a head injury last Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys. He left the game after only 18 snaps and didn\u2019t return.\n\nGreen Bay has won four of its past five games on Monday night, with the one loss coming against the Lions on Nov. 6, 2017, at Lambeau. Brett Hundley was the Packers\u2019 starting quarterback, as Rodgers was out with a broken collarbone.\n\nThe Packers will appear on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d for the 27th consecutive season, the second-longest streak in the NFL behind only the Denver Broncos (28). But they will do it with a new head coach for the first time in a long time.\n\nGreen Bay is 32-32-1 in the regular season on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d but 0-0 on Monday night under first-year coach Matt LaFleur. The 39-year-old said he will rely on Rodgers when preparing for his first Monday night matchup.\n\n\u201cWith a quarterback as experienced as we have, I definitely want to see what he sees on tape and what he\u2019s comfortable with going into each game,\u201d LaFleur said.\n\nLaFleur said the offense has left a lot of plays and opportunities on the field this season. The Packers are averaging 23.8 points per game, but have scored 27-plus points in four of the past five \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games.\n\nRodgers has been limited in practice this week with an injured knee. But injury or not, LaFleur said he\u2019s not too worried about how the star quarterback will perform on the big stage.\n\n\u201cYeah, I feel like our guy is pretty good,\u201d LaFleur said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Aaron Rodgers loves playing on Monday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/packers_cowboys_football_14521_c0-189-4542-2838_s1200x700.jpg?dc3395a432703f8159927cd3ff6a287fa35ed454", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
