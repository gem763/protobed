With the people Steyer is hiring, Robertson told me, it\u2019s \u201capparent\u201d they\u2019re \u201cpreparing a strategy to win the nomination.\u201d A voter, he said, had just brought up to him the community bank that Steyer had started years ago with his wife.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he is resonating appears to indicate that the race is wide open,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nRead: Why Tom Steyer changed his mind on running for president\n\nSteyer is the billionaire self-funding chaos factor in the primary race, with the potential to shift the center of gravity as others run out of money and he\u2019s still standing come spring. He\u2019s one of the most successful hedge-funders ever, and his team likes to think of him as an undervalued stock in the race.\n\n\u201cWe can organize in states on Super Tuesday that no other candidate can,\u201d says Doug Rubin, a longtime Democratic operative serving as a senior adviser to the campaign, pointing to how Steyer\u2019s millions can pay for campaign staff and television ads while other campaigns are going to be running out of cash or making tough decisions about where to compete. \u201cThe way the race is now is not the way it\u2019s going to be in January and February,\u201d Rubin says.\n\nTonight in Ohio, Steyer will be the only candidate onstage who hasn\u2019t appeared in one of the primary debates so far. He\u2019s also one of just eight who have qualified for the next debate in November.\n\nWhen we met in South Carolina at a bland hotel a few miles from the jamboree, Steyer greeted me with a rant about Republicans taking their time to distance themselves from President Donald Trump, comparing them to co-conspirators in a trial. But that\u2019s not the Steyer that he and his team are trying to present, on the trail or at the debate.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of our resources is that we can play the long game,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cTom doesn\u2019t need a splashy moment to be competitive long-term.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the tension of Steyer\u2019s campaign: He jokes about how people would think, from media coverage, that his first name is \u201cBillionaire,\u201d but his campaign is possible only because of said billionaire status.\n\nSteyer and his aides think any other campaign or reporter who isn\u2019t taking him seriously is making a big mistake. He has a staff of 200 (and growing), spread among his San Francisco headquarters and offices in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, Colorado, and California. His campaign has a research operation that\u2019s been testing and targeting messages, digging deeper than any other candidate could afford in the primary. His team announced last week that 166,000 people had given an average of $12 each to his campaign, for a total of almost $2 million, since July. (Yes, they gave this money to a billionaire.) A Morning Consult average of early-state polling last week had him at 8 percent, or fourth place in the race.", "description": "The \u201coutsider\u201d billionaire candidate will make his debate-stage debut tonight.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19278622346770-2/facebook.jpg?1571145902", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
