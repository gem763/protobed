In the last 36 hours, there have been 14 \u201cprovocative attacks\u201d from Syria, Turkey\u2019s defence ministry said, adding it was continuing to coordinate closely with Washington on implementation of the accord.\n\nIf the agreement with the United States, a NATO ally, falters, Turkey will continue its military operation from where it left off, Erdogan said.\n\n\u201cIf it works, it works. If not, we will continue to crush the heads of the terrorists the minute the 120 hours (of the ceasefire) are over,\u201d Erdogan told flag-waving supporters in the central Turkish province of Kayseri.\n\n\u201cIf the promises that were made to us are not kept, we will not wait like we did before and we will continue the operation where it left off once the time we set has run out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe surprise deal to suspend Turkey\u2019s military offensive in Syria hinged on Erdogan\u2019s demand that Washington agree on a time limit on any ceasefire, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on Friday.\n\nThe deal aims to stem a humanitarian crisis, which displaced 200,000 civilians in the region, and ease a security scare over thousands of Islamic State captives guarded by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia targeted by the Turkish assault.\n\nAnkara regards the YPG, the main component of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Turkish army vehicles are moving on a road near the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 18, 2019.

Erdogan said on Friday it would run for some 440 km from west to east along the border, though the U.S. special envoy for Syria said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting.\n\nErdogan also said on Friday Turkey would set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria, and that he would hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on what steps to take in the planned \u201csafe zone\u201d next week.\n\nEMERGENCY TALKS IN SOCHI\n\nThe truce also aimed to ease a crisis triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision earlier this month to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria, a move criticised in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of loyal Kurdish allies who had fought for years alongside U.S. troops against Islamic State.\n\nTrump defended his decision as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and said the truce reached with Turkey would save millions of lives. Trump later said he held a phone call with Erdogan and that the Turkish leader \u201cvery much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work\u201d.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s move also means the extent of Turkey\u2019s ambitions in the region is likely to be determined by Russia and Iran, who both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and look to fill the vacuum created by the U.S. retreat.\n\nAssad has already deployed his forces in territory formerly protected by Washington, invited by the Kurds. Erdogan, who has backed rebels fighting to oust Assad, has said Turkey has no problem with Syrian government forces deploying near the border.\n\nBut Erdogan said on Saturday he would discuss the Syrian deployment in northern Syria in his planned talks with Putin during a visit to Russia\u2019s Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn certain parts of our operation area, (Assad) regime forces under Russian protection are situated. We will discuss this issue with Mr Putin. We need to find a solution,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nTurkish army vehicles are moving on a road near the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\n\u201cBut the same is valid there too. If it works, it works. If not, then we will continue to implement our own plans,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\nWhile Erdogan and Putin have forged close ties over defence and energy cooperation, as well as efforts to find a political solution in Syria, Moscow has said the Turkish offensive into Syria was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and should be limited.\n\nOn Friday, Russian officials discussed with Assad in Damascus the need to de-escalate the situation in northeast Syria, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Saturday.", "description": "President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Turkey would press on with its offensive into northeastern Syria and \"crush the heads of terrorists\" if a deal with Washington on the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the area were not fully implemented.", "authors": ["Tuvan Gumrukcu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442643334&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I07U", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
