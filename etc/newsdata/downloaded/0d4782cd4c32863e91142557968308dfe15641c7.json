So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry\u2019s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger\u2019s nephew.\"\n\nHe added: \"Biden should agree to release records to see if he flew Hunter to China in Dec. 2013 on AF 2 to facilitate Hunter\u2019s sale of his office to China for a total of $1.5 billion. Is there any doubt that China paid it to compromise VP. But they bought another pol as well. Guess?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump attorney insisted Biden, one of the frontrunners for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has high-level help.\n\n\"Democrat party is covering up a pattern of corruption involving high level members of the Obama cabinet,\" Giuliani said. \"The multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play is mind boggling. Biden Family sale of office to Ukraine was not the only one or the most egregious.
