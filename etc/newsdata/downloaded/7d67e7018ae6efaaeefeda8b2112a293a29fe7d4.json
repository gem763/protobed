The July 25 call is now at the center of a U.S. impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cI think such things, such conversations between heads of independent states, they shouldn\u2019t be published,\u201d Zelensky told reporters at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. He didn\u2019t indicate whether the White House warned him that the comments would be released.\n\nBut he also said he\u2019s \u201cnot afraid\u201d of the publication and that \u201cno one can pressure me.\u201d He said the Biden investigation is just one of \u201cmany cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian general prosecutor\u2019s office, the office of former President Petro Poroshenko and other Ukrainian government officials wouldn\u2019t comment to The Associated Press on the transcript or the Biden probe on Thursday.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Biden investigation is very \u201chigh-profile\u201d in the United States, Zelensky said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the details of this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent leaders talk to me at many international meetings about various criminal cases,\u201d he said, noting other examples from Italy and Turkey. \u201cI talk about such cases every day.\u201d\n\nAt a meeting with Zelensky on Wednesday in New York, Trump says he placed \u201cno pressure\u201d on the Ukrainian leader. But the rough transcript summarizing the call shows Trump repeatedly prodded Zelensky to work with the U.S. attorney general and Trump\u2019s personal attorney to investigate Biden, a former U.S. vice president.\n\nThe call is the subject of a whistleblower complaint against Trump and the basis for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nZelensky also tried to smooth over tensions with Germany and France after the transcript revealed critical comments toward German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for any assistance to Ukraine from our European leaders, from Ms. Merkel, from Mr. Macron, and from others,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he maintained criticism of the Nord Stream 2 project for a pipeline to send Russian gas to Europe. He called it \u201ca big threat to our energy security\u201d and said Ukraine would lose billions of dollars.\n\nMerkel\u2019s office refused to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks in the transcript that the German leader \u201ctalks Ukraine, but she doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry provided figures disputing Trump\u2019s account, telling The Associated Press that since 2014, German direct support to Ukraine amounted to 1.18 billion euros, in addition to another 200 million euros through European Union support.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the transcript was published Wednesday, not Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ukraine's president says his comments in a conversation with U.S. President Trump shouldn't have been publicly released and is playing down Ukraine's investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/Trump_59935.jpg-590b5_c0-0-5472-3190_s1770x1032.jpg?84283544d3cc688d49296344fdb2455c1a0f271f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
