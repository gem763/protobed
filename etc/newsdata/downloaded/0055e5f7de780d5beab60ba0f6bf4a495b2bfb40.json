Government officials have not confirmed.\n\nMexico has been embroiled in a wave of violence since the government launched an all-out offensive to root out organized criminal organizations in 2006 under former President Felipe Calderon. Since then, there have been more than 200,000 murders.\n\nDuring his daily morning press briefing Tuesday, L\u00f3pez Obrador said the governments that proceeded his allowed criminal organizations to grow while implementing counter-solutions that never seemed to work.\n\n'I'm optimistic we'll secure peace ... we're completely dedicated to this issue, but (past governments) allowed it to grow. There's a new security model now,' L\u00f3pez Obrador said, describing the site of the ambush as a 'violent area.'\n\nAt the funeral home in Morelia, relatives of the dead described a situation in which relatively young, new, lightly armed police were sent in to confront hardened foes with heavier armament, without any support.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez graduated from the police academy just nine months earlier; he left behind a 1-year-old son and a wife who is five months pregnant.\n\n\"They asked for help, reinforcements, and it never arrived,\" his brother said, alluding to recordings of desperate radio calls sent out as the convoy came under intense fire.\n\nThe attackers let loose with .50 caliber sniper rifles and AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles, and at least some were in armored vehicles, state prosecutors said. Some of the officers' bodies were still inside patrol trucks when they were set on fire.\n\nWARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT\n\nSEE VIDEO BELOW\n\nA police officer, one of 13 killed during an ambush in Mexico on Monday, lies on the ground outside a home\n\nA motorist captured the horrific scene outside a home in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, where 13 police officers were murdered and three others were injured\n\nThe leftist leader said the ambush was 'very regrettable' but reiterated that his commitment to increased spending on security and tackling the root causes of violence would eventually pay dividends.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has sharply criticized past efforts that pursued an army-led approach to battling crime.\n\nAt least 153,762 criminal organization members and 721 soldiers have been murdered since during the 13-year battle with cartels.\n\nBut after a record number of homicides in Mexico in 2018, they are on track to go even higher this year, putting L\u00f3pez Obrador under increasing pressure to stop massacres like Monday's sneak attack in Michoac\u00e1n.\n\nHe hopes his welfare schemes, including youth scholarships and apprenticeships, will help draw people away from crime.\n\nGrieving family members of the police officers killed in an apparent cartel ambush gathered outside a funeral home in the Mexican state of Michoacan on Tuesday, many of them angry at the government and police chiefs they believe sent their loved ones to a certain death.\n\n\"The good ones are here,\" said the brother of slain officer Marco Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, 20, gesturing at the massive funeral hall.\n\n\"And those responsible for this, they are also here,\" he said just as the state's police chief and his top brass got out of cars. The man and other relatives refused to give their names for fear of reprisals in the western state where violence blamed on drug gangs has jumped in recent months.\n\nPhotos of the crime scene published on social media showed bullet-riddled police vehicles set on fire, as well as the bodies of slain officers on the ground.\n\nA team of cops serving a warrant in central Mexico on Monday were ambushed and killed\n\nAlleged gunmen tied to Mexico's most powerful criminal syndicate left two poster board cards threatening to attack other cops who support rival groups\n\nThe Mexican military guards the site of Monday morning's horrific attack that left at least 14 cops dead and three others injured\n\nThey also included placards left on vehicles brazenly signed by Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful gangs, warning police not to support rival outfits.\n\nUnder the leadership of Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes, one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords - who was once associated with El Chapo's Sinaloa Cartel - the gang has unleashed an all-out bloody battle against several cartels.\n\n'El Mencho' is also wanted by the United States Department of Justice, which is offering a $10 million reward for his capture.\n\nAround 80 soldiers and an army helicopter have been dispatched to investigate and find the perpetrators, Gen. Luis Sandoval, the defense minister, told the news conference.\n\nAlongside him, Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the use of force is a legitimate government tool to deal with lawlessness, but should only be considered as a last resort.\n\n'We will pacify the country without using violence, without repression,' Durazo said.\n\nAfter taking office in December, Lopez Obrador created a militarized National Guard police force to contain the violence.\n\nBut many of the National Guard have instead been deployed to police Mexico's borders to placate U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs if Lopez Obrador does not reduce the flow of U.S.-bound migrants from Central America.", "description": "Mexican President Andres  Manuel Lopez Obrador is sticking to his securti plan and blaming previous governments after 13 cops were killed by a cartel on Monday.", "authors": ["Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/18/19753376-0-image-a-52_1571161607541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
