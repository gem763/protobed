It\u2019s me. I am she who thinks.\n\nLook, I know we\u2019re all adults here\u2014and by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean 65-year-old Quaid and his 26-year-old fianc\u00e9e, University of Texas PhD student Laura Savoie. Still, it weirds me out that Savoie is 39 years younger than the Parent Trap star, and that she\u2019s younger than Quaid\u2019s oldest son, Jack.\n\nI feel conflicted about this, of course. I mean, I\u2019m very happy for Savoie, just as I am for any young, hot genius who makes good on my long-term life goal of marrying a wealthy older man. But then I consider Quaid\u2019s side of things, and I think about all the reasons why these guys can\u2019t seem to make things work with women their own age, why they might be drawn to someone younger, hotter, less powerful, and perhaps less complicated to be with. I remember how much our culture values and devalues women based on our fertility and how disposable we become when we cannot bear a man children. And then, I come to the startling realization that people 39 years younger than me aren\u2019t even alive yet, and I feel compelled to run towards the nearest knife block, jaw unhinged, ready and willing to devour its pointy contents.\n\nAm I justified in being so judgmental? Not really, but I did manage to track down some very scientific data that makes me feel a whole lot better about being such a heinous bitch. A study published last year in Science Advances found that, on straight dating apps, men\u2019s desirability peaks at age 50, while women\u2019s peaks at 18. And according to some Dutch social psychologists who studied men\u2019s and women\u2019s perspectives on romantic age gaps back in 2001, women, like myself, tend to prefer having partners who are close to their own age, while men are open to fucking and marrying a wider age range of women, especially women younger than them, especially as the men themselves age.\n\nThis is particularly true of men over 40, the researchers said, which might explain why Quaid keeps marrying women in their late 20s or early 30s, no matter his age. In case you\u2019re not familiar with the actor\u2019s marital track record, Quaid:\n\nmarried his first wife, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll High School star P.J. Soles, when she was 28.\n\nstar P.J. Soles, when she was 28. married his second wife, rom-com legend Meg Ryan, when she was 30.\n\nmarried his third wife, real estate agent Kimberly Buffington, when she was 31.\n\nproposed to his probably fourth wife, PhD student Laura Savoie, when she was 26.\n\nHe keeps getting older, but they stay the same age? Hmmmm! Fascinating! Hand me my chewing knife!\n\nLess scientifically, we might consider the classic \u201chalf my age, plus seven\u201d rule. The rule is pretty self-explanatory: You can\u2019t date someone younger than half your age, plus seven. Half of Quaid\u2019s age is 32 and a half, plus seven, is about 40. Savoie is nowhere near 40 years old\u2014she\u2019s not even half of 40 plus seven! Therefore, it\u2019s weird. Even without this rule, it\u2019s still weird!!\n\nTo recap:\n\nMen should date women who are around their age.\n\nIf a man is going on a date with a woman who is younger than his son, he should not.\n\nIf a man is, in general, he should not.\n\nHope that clears this up.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "I stared into the void of the 39-year age gap between Dennis Quaid and fianc\u00e9e Laura Savoie.
