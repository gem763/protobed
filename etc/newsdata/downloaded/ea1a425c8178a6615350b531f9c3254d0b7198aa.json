(Photo by John Sciulli/Getty Images for NBA 2K20)\n\nDamian Lillard and Shaquille O\u2019Neal are engaged in a diss-track war, and the volleys are flying fast.\n\nLillard, star for the Portland Trail Blazers, released a diss track on Tuesday morning about Shaq, just days after Shaq had released one of his own about Lillard.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo what are these two beefing about? It began when Lillard went on Joe Budden\u2019s podcast in early September and said that he\u2019s a better rapper than Shaq. Lillard starts talking about Shaq at the 11:30 mark in the video below.\n\n\"People weren't looking at it like he's a real rapper. It was like, 'That\u2019s Shaq rapping.' So, of course, it was a big deal.\"\n\nShaq obviously didn\u2019t appreciate Lillard\u2019s dig at his rap skills. So what do you do when someone doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re good at rapping? You release a diss track about that person. Behold, Shaq\u2019s Lillard-themed diss track, performed by a Shaq puppet. No, seriously. That\u2019s not a joke. (Warning: NSFW language ahead.)\n\nShaq got in some outstanding burns.\n\nDamian Lillard said he's a better rapper than Shaq.\n\n\n\nSo Shaq responded with a diss track \ud83c\udf7f pic.twitter.com/ZaTNDmt44P \u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 1, 2019\n\nHe even included the phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t believe some clown is testing me.\u201d\n\nShaq had no choice but to believe, though, when Lillard \u2014 known as Dame D.O.L.L.A. \u2014 dropped his own diss track called \"Reign Reign Go Away\" on Tuesday morning. And it\u2019s a barn-burner. (Warning: More NSFW language ahead.)\n\nStory continues\n\nLillard was not messing around. He went in hard on Shaq. He covered Shaq\u2019s shoes, his playing career, and movie career.\n\n\u201cI'm new school, got new hits Space Jam, not Blue Chips Hangman, your shoes s\u2014t\u201d\n\nDid you think that was all? Oh no. Lillard gets in a Kobe dig, brings up Shaq\u2019s love of endorsement deals, and even mentions that time when Shaq got into a comically small car.\n\n\u201cWe both could be working at Kinkos and Kobe won you them rings, though Nursery rhyme spitting, small car sittin', Icy Hot poster boy TNT snitchin' you big man hatin', mad at my existence Had a song with Bad Boy, no Jordan to the Pistons\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just a small taste of what Lillard serves up. It\u2019s hard to see how any Shaq response could possibly match the all-out roasting Lillard gave him. But the only way you lose a diss track war is if you stop trying. So for our sake, let\u2019s hope Shaq (or his puppet) gives it a whirl.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Damian Lillard and Shaq are having a diss-track fight, and it's amazing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BhZuhcC4H1WwWuEdunxL9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTEuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ix0zAmrQRN1D.sL3dl40iw--~B/aD0xOTk2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c1e553a0-e471-11e9-bfa1-89f9934fce4a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
