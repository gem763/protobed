But according to Donald Trump, he may be responsible for helping usher in the latest phase.\n\n\u201cI was called by the great pastors of this country in a call about a week ago,\u201d the president told Fox News\u2019 Jeanine Pirro over the weekend, \u201cand they said they have never seen electricity in the air, enthusiasm in the air. Churches are joining. People are joining the church.\u201d Trump added this Christian revival is the result of \u201ceverybody\u201d knowing that \u201cthe Russian witch hunt was a faux, phony fraud. And we got rid of that. And then they came up with this Ukrainian story that was made up by Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nEvidently, this politically inspired Great Awakening is necessary, at least according to Attorney General William Barr, who spoke a day earlier at Notre Dame\u2019s law school and condemned societal ills on conspiring American secularists.\n\n\u201cWe see the growing ascendancy of secularism and the doctrine of moral relativism,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically every measure of this social pathology continues to gain ground.\u201d He described several social issues as \u201cconsequences of this moral upheaval.\u201d \u201cAlong with the wreckage of the family, we are seeing record levels of depression and mental illness, dispirited young people, soaring suicide rates, increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males, an increase in senseless violence and a deadly drug epidemic.\u201d\n\nBill Barr, with a conspiratorial flare, added, \u201cThis is not decay. This is organized destruction. Secularists and their allies have marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture, the entertainment industry and academia, in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\u201d\n\nI can appreciate the fact that Barr is \u201cneck-deep\u201d in the scandal that\u2019s likely to lead to the president\u2019s impeachment, and perhaps his bizarre tirade against non-religious Americans was intended to solidify Team Trump\u2019s support among Christian conservatives.\n\nBut that\u2019s not much of an excuse for the attorney general\u2019s offensive speech.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s factually wrong. There are complex factors that contribute to problems such as drug abuse, gun violence, mental illness, and suicide, but to assume these issues would disappear in a more religious society is absurd. There are plenty of Western societies, for example, that are far more secular than the United States, and many of them are in better positions on these same social ills.\n\nFor that matter, if Barr is concerned about \u201cthe doctrine of moral relativism,\u201d he may want to consider the broader relationship between his boss and his social-conservative followers \u2013 many of whom have decided to look the other way on Donald Trump\u2019s moral failings because they approve of his political agenda.\n\nBut even putting aside these relevant details, it was the circumstances that were especially jarring: the nation\u2019s chief law-enforcement officer delivered public remarks in which he alleged non-religious citizens of his own country are conspiring to advance a sinister \u201csocial pathology.\u201d\n\nRoughly one-in-five Americans considers themselves atheists, agnostics, or lacking in any specific faith affiliation. The idea that their attorney general sees them as part of a nefarious force, conspiring in the shadows to undermine morality, isn\u2019t just ridiculous; it\u2019s at odds with the country\u2019s First Amendment principles.\n\nWalter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, described Barr\u2019s comments as \u201crepugnant,\u201d adding, \u201cHis job is to defend the First Amendment. But this immoral, unpatriotic, borderline monarchist and defender of corruption has other ideas.\u201d", "description": "The nation's chief law-enforcement officer accused non-religious citizens of his own country of conspiring to advance a sinister \"social pathology.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_mj_joe_barr_micro_191001_1920x1080.jpg?itok=gVvnpdpK", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
