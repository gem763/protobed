She is the first parent to be sentenced in the massive college admissions scandal that has led to charges for dozens for members of wealthy and connected families.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and fraud as part of a deal with prosecutors in May. \"I was frightened, I was stupid, and I was so wrong,\u201d she said. She is also required to pay a $30,000 fine and do 250 hours of community service.\n\nThe amount she paid is far less than some of her alleged fellow schemers. Some parents are accused of paying as much as $500,000 and bribing coaches to say they were recruiting their children. A total of 51 people have been charged.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nNews of Huffman\u2019s sentencing sparked strong reaction from many who felt she got a lenient sentence because of her wealth and fame. Her case was compared to those of poor people of color who received much more substantial punishments for similar crimes. Huffman's sentence, some say, reveals the same inequities and racial disparities in higher education also exist within the justice system.\n\nOthers argue that her punishment was fair, or even too harsh, given the lack of a clear victim of her crime, the low likelihood she\u2019d reoffend and her willing cooperation in the investigation. The way to create a more equitable justice system, some activists say, isn\u2019t to give people like Huffman harsher sentences, but to be more forgiving to those who, though they may lack her resources, make similar mistakes. \u201cPrisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does,\u201d singer John Legend said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nThe fact that Huffman received jail time is seen by some legal experts as a bad sign for \u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Loughlin, who is fighting charges that she and her husband paid $500,000 to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as athletes. If found guilty, Loughlin \u201cshould expect a jail sentence that is several factors greater\u201d than Huffman\u2019s, a criminal defense attorney said. Her next scheduled court date is Oct. 2.\n\nPerspectives\n\nHuffman got a lesser sentence by accepting responsibility for her crime.\n\n\u201c...Huffman's conduct following the exposure of these crimes has exemplified grace, contrition, remorse and acceptance of responsibility. Instead of making endless excuses, trying to justify her behavior, and directing blame at others, she has owned her actions. That matters.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Joey Jackson, CNN\n\nHer sentence shows how the wealthy and famous avoid proper punishment.\n\n\u201cThere is no justice. Not when the rich and the powerful, the amoral and the sleazy \u2014 liars, cheats and unspeakably entitled thieves of anything and everything they can snatch with their paws from honorable folk \u2014 get away with it, time and again.\u201d \u2014 Andrea Peyser, New York Post\n\nThe lenience shown Huffman should be applied to less notable people in similar positions.\n\n\u201cSo yes, let\u2019s talk about all the more vulnerable, less privileged women and men thrown behind bars for crimes far less egregious and offensive than Huffman\u2019s \u2014 that is, after all, the more pressing story. But let\u2019s also draw the right conclusion: That fairness means more sentences like the one Huffman received.\u201d \u2014 Jill Filipovic, Vanity Fair\n\nThe prominence of her case blocked any chance she could avoid jail time.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Huffman was likely sentenced to 14 days in prison because of her fame, not in spite of it. This will have a negative impact on the run of the mill case, leading other first-time non-violent defendants to prison, when there is no need for it.\u201d \u2014 David Oscar Markus, The Hill\n\nA longer jail sentence for Huffman won\u2019t do anything to fix the problem of mass incarceration.\n\n\u201cPunishment isn\u2019t zero sum. No one is served by Felicity Huffman serving two weeks in prison. No one would be served if she spent 20 years in prison. There are different ways to think about how people can make amends for wrongdoing. There are different ways to conceive of justice.\u201d \u2014 Criminal justice expert Clint Smith\n\nHuffman was a small player in a massive corruption scheme.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman's 14-day jail sentence for paying to rig her daughter's SAT score as part of the college admissions scandal has been called both too lenient and too harsh.
