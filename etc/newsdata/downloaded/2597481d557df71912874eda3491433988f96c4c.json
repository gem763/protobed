My girlfriend sells wine and drinks a ton of wine, and I, famously, don\u2019t drink very much. She\u2019s like, I don\u2019t like room temperature beverages. So if we pour a nice bottle of wine to enjoy on the beach and it gets room temperature, she\u2019s like, now you just wasted all of this wine. So, the YETI Rambler can sit in direct sunlight with the lid on and stay cold for two days.\n\nBill: It\u2019s crazy. My boyfriend and I go for a week every summer to Provincetown, and the beach that we really like is like a 45-minute hike out in the salt marsh in the direct sun, and we load this thing in our backpacks, make it out to the beach, and the wine will be ice cold.\n\nLibby: Right.
