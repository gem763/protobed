Lindsey Graham (R-SC) vowed to have the \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d charging wrongdoing of President Donald Trump testify publicly if House Democrats move forward with impeachment.\n\nGraham said. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen: if the whistleblowers\u2019 allegations are turned into an impeachment article it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined. Nobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser. So here is what I\u2019m going to insist upon, but the whistleblower one or two, whatever, they come forward, under oath, inform so the public can judge her credibility.
