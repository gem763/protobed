Like, 'No! Not Kanye!\"'\n\nHe later shed even more light on his political leanings as he said he is 'the most liberal.'\n\nInteresting: Kanye said that he is working on the framework of a presidential run possibly in 2024, he is pictured in the Oval Office back in October 2018\n\nEyebrow raising: The husband of Kim Kardashian - pictured with current US President Donald Trump - said when he wins the election: 'I will remember ... any founder that didn't have the capacity to understand culturally what we're doing'\n\nWhere it began: Kanye famously met Donald Trump at Trump Tower in December 2016 while he was president elect\n\nWest also said that he used to be addicted to pornography before recently quitting the habit. Just last year he served as co-creative director for the PornHub Awards.\n\nThe Hell Of A Life hitmaker explained: 'Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction. My dad had a Playboy left out at age five, and it\u2019s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life from age five to now, having to kick the habit.'\n\nKanye's strive to be pure even drove him to request that those who collaborated on upcoming album Jesus Is King also do the same.\n\nHe said: 'I was asking people to... this is gonna be radical what I\u2019m about to say.\n\n'I was asking people to not have premarital sex': Kanye's strive to be pure even drove him to request that those who collaborated on upcoming album Jesus Is King also do the same\n\n'There were times where I was asking people to not have premarital sex while they were working.\n\n'I know that\u2019s one where The Shade Room gonna be like, \"what you mean don\u2019t have premarital sex? you better turn that Meg The Stallion on right now.\" But seriously there\u2019s times where I went to people that were working on other projects and said 'could you just work and focus on this?'\n\nKanye also revealed he attempted to bury the hatchet with Drake, and even left his phone number at the rapper's house.\n\nLoved up: Kanye pictured with wife Kim Kardashian at the Met Gala in New York City back in May\n\n'I walk over to Drake's house with no security and leave my phone number, like, \"Here's my phone number.\" I'm not trying to ring the door bell, he might be busy. He got a studio in there, just think he recording at all times,'\n\nHe also revealed that checking himself into the hospital for 'psychiatric emergency' back in 2016 led him to Christianity.\n\nWest explained: 'Now that I\u2019m in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me.\n\nAnd the crowd goes wild: Kanye pictured at his album and filming experience at The Forum in Inglewood on Wednesday night\n\n'I\u2019ve spread a lot of things. There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me, I was letting you know what the Hennessey had done for me, but now I\u2019m letting you know what Jesus has done for me, and in that I\u2019m no longer a slave, I\u2019m a son now, a son of God. I\u2019m free. The most space that I had to think is when I went to the hospital.'\n\nSomehow lost in the shuffle is that Kanye announced that a new album titled Jesus Is Born will be released on Christmas Day before Jesus Is King has even been put out.\n\nHe said: 'Sunday Service album, Jesus is Born, on Christmas is coming.'\n\nKanye West's ninth studio album, Jesus Is King, along with the documentary of the same name are set for release tomorrow.", "description": "The 42-year-old rapper sat down for an exclusive interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Beats 1 radio which was released on Thursday.", "authors": ["Justin Enriquez For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/01/20159270-0-image-a-12_1571961676624.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
