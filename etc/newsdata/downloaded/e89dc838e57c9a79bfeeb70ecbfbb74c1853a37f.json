Annuities are actually good if you don't have money,\" he said. \"Because you can't take any risk.\n\n\"Now interest rates heading to zero is actually adding to this whole retirement dilemma. How do you retire where you can get no interest on your term deposits any more? Even if you look at the bank hybrid instruments, most of them are floating rate, all those have halved their distributions.\"\n\nMost products that offer a high yield demand more risk.\n\n\"We have a view that ultimately if you want to have a return in your portfolio you have to be able to take more equity risk in retirement, but how can you take equity risk without something known as sequencing risk?\"\n\nThe alternative, he joked, is \"you'll have to die earlier because you'll run out of money and that's the sequencing risk issue, you get a major market downturn right around your retirement or in retirement\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Douglass' objective is to work out how to get a 4 to 5 per cent return without assuming too much sequencing risk. \"That is the conceptual dilemma and it's complex,\" he said. \"I don't want to say any more than that, but for people who have got enough money in retirement and can take a little bit more risk, we can actually get around a lot of the sequencing risk in retirement.\"\n\nSustainable strategy\n\nNobody had thought of Magellan's solution, which has now been in the works for two-and-a-half years, Mr Douglass said, including an 18-month engagement with the tax office.\n\nMagellan is also considering making a sustainable strategy available to Australian retail investors, but it is undecided.\n\nThe investment manager asserted at its annual meeting in Sydney on Thursday that a few poor performing stocks would not cause concern for fund inflows.\n\nFor a 25-stock portfolio, an average position size might be 4 per cent, the fund manager said. \"In order for there to be a 1 per cent impact on performance in a single year, a stock price would have to drop by 25 per cent. Even though we think we're concentrated,\" he continued.\n\n\"We have had individual stocks that have been hit materially, one would have been Kraft Heinz in the last year in our global equities strategy and it was a 4 or 5 per cent position in our fund and it had fallen 30 per cent. Our strategy materially outperformed,\" Mr Douglass said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A one, big stock mistake in a 25-stock portfolio doesn't actually have a material impact.\"\n\nAbsolute returns\n\nIt would be problematic were its investments highly correlated, and if they fell when the broader market was not experiencing a drawdown, he hypothesised.\n\nMagellan aims to deliver absolute returns over the investment cycle, he said, and investors understand its emphasis on managing downside risk, which means its strategies perform better in falling markets.\n\nThe biggest risk is \"if we start performing in a way that's not giving people downside protection\". If the market fell 30 per cent and Magellan's strategy was down 50 per cent, that would mean that the downside protection failed, and \"clients would be asking serious questions\".\n\nThe fund manager warned last week that one of the biggest threats to global equities was a rethink on the direction of interest rates, but for now, Magellan had adopted a lower assumption of the appropriate rate to embed in stock valuations.\n\nThe stock closed at $49.72, up 2.6 per cent.", "description": "Chairman Hamish Douglass says the business has been working on its solution for two-and-a-half years, including an 18-month discussion with the ATO.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2693%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_356%2C$y_214/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aa586b3e5970a05f6bfab77fb020f2ed80c014ba", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
