It'll also use the iPhone 11's U1 ultra-wide-band chip that could offer more precise tracking.\n\nLonger-range tracking with AirTags could use the crowd-sourcing feature in iOS 13 that relies on the Bluetooth connection from other Apple devices.\n\nIt's suggested that Apple may reveal its AirTags by the end of the year.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nApple is reportedly developing a system and devices that can help you find objects you might lose once in a while, similar to Tile devices.\n\nRumors about Apple's supposed AirTags started emerging in April this year. More recently, MacRumors recently got ahold of some screenshots for AirTags on an iPhone, revealing how the devices would work.\n\nThe AirTags will work with the \"Find My\" app in iOS, according to MacRumors. You'll be able to place the AirTags on objects like keys and bags to track their whereabouts at home via a new \"Items\" tag in the Find My app in iOS.\n\nTo track your items, AirTags will use a Bluetooth connection with your iPhone, as well as Apple's new U1 ultra-wide-band chip inside the latest iPhone 11-series smartphones. Tracking with the U1 chip should offer more precision than a Bluetooth connection, but it would still mean that you'd need to be relatively near your lost AirTagged items to track them down. MacRumors suggests that Apple might use augmented reality with your iPhone's camera to show you exactly where your AirTagged item is in a room.\n\nFor longer-range tracking, AirTags might use the crowd-sourcing feature in the latest version of iOS 13, which relies on the Bluetooth connection on other iPhones, iPads, and Macs to find your own Apple devices.\n\nSetting up the AirTags is supposedly as easy as pulling a tag on an AirTag device and placing it near an iPhone. It sounds similar to how easy and automatic it is to pair Apple's AirPods with an iPhone. Once the AirTag device has paired with your phone, you'll be able to name the AirTag, presumably with the name of the object you want to keep tabs on.\n\nIt's not entirely clear when Apple will unveil its AirTags, if at all. It's suggested we might see them by the end of this year, but we'll have to wait and see.", "description": "It sounds a lot like the Tile system, but it also looks like it'll use some of the chips and tech in the iPhone 11 to help you find things faster.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9f225dee0194e13105a88?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
