(Stephanie Keith/Reuters)\n\nHis conservative defense of humanism draws a line in the sand and causes uproar.\n\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s disconnect from the comic-book movie cult, confessed in a recent interview with Empire magazine, is the first line in the sand to be drawn by a filmmaker rather than a critic. But Scorsese\u2019s forthrightness was met with shock only because the comment seemed to contradict his cinephile legend. We all had thought: Marty never saw a movie he didn\u2019t like.\n\nHere are the words, about comic-book movies, that started a quiet riot on the Internet:\n\nI don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\n\nScorsese was being polite as possible, but his statement opposed the media-led celebration of the most commercially successful moviemaking this millennium, specifically the Marvel Comics Universe. To challenge the moviegoing generation that has become completely susceptible to the marketing of adolescent violence and sensationalism \u2014 of comic-book culture dominating what used to be film culture \u2014 amounts to an ideological war.\n\nIt is Scorsese\u2019s pre-millennium taste that got him in trouble, and fanboys hit back, denouncing him as an old man screaming at clouds. No matter that Scorsese was riding new currents of hype for The Irishman. Even Samuel L. Jackson, Nick Fury in the MCU, spoke out: \u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t like his stuff, either.\u201d (True backstabbing from SamJack, who once bragged about his 90-second role ending up as a corpse in GoodFellas.)\n\nThe notion of \u201chuman beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being\u201d seems very 20th century; it\u2019s no longer what audiences want from storytelling. (And those who are old enough have given up and try to seem hip by praising the specious \u201cGolden Age of Television.\u201d) This insensitivity, a consequence of the cynicism that has become popular since the Pulp Fiction\u2013Avatar revolution, is the real disconnect that Scorsese was addressing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEstablishing his reputation with several stylish expressions of Catholic angst and pop-culture fever, Scorsese showed that film-geek dedication could encompass serious art. Surely, this guy would respect the Comic-Con sensibility. Yet, in his best films \u2014 Who\u2019s That Knocking at My Door?, Mean Streets, and Taxi Driver \u2014 Scorsese kept faith with the Western cultural tradition \u2014 even as his rock-and-roll-generation instincts forged a synthesis in which Federico Fellini, Michael Powell, and Elia Kazan met Kenneth Anger and John Cassavetes. (His 1974 feminist road comedy Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore is a worthy, gregarious exception.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuper-geek Scorsese, who started the Film Foundation in 1990 for the preservation of classic and world movies, always looked for the moral potential in popular art. That\u2019s how his Seventies American Renaissance colleagues from Coppola to DePalma to Walter Hill and Robert Altman advanced the art form. In that heyday, audiences expected self-examination; today\u2019s audiences expect escapism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy using the word \u201ccinema,\u201d Scorsese went beyond the ken of the comics and video-game generation. (Has game-changer Quentin Tarantino ever uttered the word \u201ccinema\u201d?)\n\nScorsese has taken an essentially conservative position, and the backlash it has raised is analogous to fiscally conservative but culturally liberal variations in social policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt felt like betrayal to those Roger Ebert lemmings still worshipping Scorsese as America\u2019s greatest filmmaker simply on the basis of his love of visual extravagance and violence. MCU worshippers are encouraged to enjoy action and violence for its fantasy, not the shocking realism of the bar fights in Mean Streets, the surreal gunplay in Who\u2019s That Knocking?, Harvey Keitel\u2019s aggressive masculine threat in Alice, the self-punishment in Raging Bull, or the sociopathy in Taxi Driver.\n\nScorsese was reacting against the degradation of cinema\u2019s artistic purpose more than against Hollywood practice itself. That his personal gangster-movie franchise suggests little more than a mob-violence theme-park ride is ironic; the repetitions of Raging Bull, GoodFellas, Casino, and The Departed have contributed to the modern viewer\u2019s reliance on overwrought, impotent machismo and a thirst for irresponsible vicarious thrills. In other words, comic-book movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Scorsese said, \u201cI don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know,\u201d his apologetic demurral indicates exhaustion with formula \u2014 not excitement with visionary voluptuousness as seen in the Zack Snyder films that belong to the mythological mode of Scorsese\u2019s hero John Boorman.\n\nFanboys resent Snyder as much as they now resent Scorsese because they hate the moral reckoning required of humanist cinema. (This may explainy why some Joker fans fall for the film\u2019s glib Scorsese references (The King of Comedy, Taxi Driver); unable to process cultural meanings, they wind up easily impressed, confused. They ignore social context and take Rupert Pupkin, Travis Bickle, and Joker as one.)\n\nLacking the experience of cinema art is like lacking the lessons of American civic history.
