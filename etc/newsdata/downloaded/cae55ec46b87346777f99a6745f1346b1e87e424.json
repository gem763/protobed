Serious braggadocio, but Page remained dismissive of opponent Kiely in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, underlining the comment with the adjunct that he would not be underestimate the Irishman.\n\n\u201cIf belittling him gets under his skin, it\u2019s a bonus. I genuinely don\u2019t rate him as a fighter, but at the same time I would never go into a fight and underestimate anyone,\" explained Page, returning to action at Bellator Dublin after the first defeat of his 15-fight career to Douglas Lima in the semi-final of Bellator's Welterweight Grand Prix in Rosemont, Illinois, in May.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPage, a unique fighter whose style is derived from freestyle kick-boxing, and whose defence and attack from strikes, knees and kicks is predicated on mesmerising opponents with fast movements into and out of range, told Telegraph Sport at the event's media day: \"I\u2019ll go in there and make sure I\u2019m at my best. If I\u2019m at my best I can say what I feel about anyone.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t have to worry about him. He\u2019s not great at all. You can see by his kickboxing and MMA career he\u2019s not great. He just talked his way into a big fight and I\u2019ve got to show him how little he is.\u201d\n\nPage is relishing fighting at the 3Arena in Dublin, a bear pit with a cacophonous wall of sound and supported by one of the strongest and most fanatical fanbases on the planet. Page knows he may be taunted on the way in, but aims to win over the audience through his performance. \u201cI always look forward to a fight, but in Dublin it\u2019s going to be great.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a lot of family and friends coming over,\" he explained. \"The Irish are proud about being Irish. They will cheer for me but they\u2019ll support Richard. When I beat him they\u2019ll cheer me, because they\u2019re not biased about showing their love afterwards. They\u2019ll definitely be supporting their own. I get that. I think it\u2019s a great attitude to have. I always say British fans don\u2019t do that enough, just cheer our own.\"\n\nPage has his sights set on a rematch with Lima, who faces incumbent champion Rory MacDonald in the 170lb tournament final on October 26 in Connecticut. That return match, though, could be another two fights away.\n\n\u201cTwo fights only purely because I\u2019m fighting again so quickly. The next one is going to be November. They fight in October so he won\u2019t be available in November. It\u2019s a question of getting this fight and the next one out of the way. If all goes well for him and he wins that, I\u2019m looking at two birds with one stone. I\u2019ll beat Lima and get the title.\u201d\n\nPage is picking Lima to defeat Macdonald, with the Canadian having beaten the Brazilian to claim Bellator's 170lb belt in their first fight, before the start of the Grand Prix Tournament, 20 months ago. \u201cI think he definitely has the tools and ability to do it. I can see Rory giving up after this fight. I just don\u2019t feel he\u2019s that interested mentally. We\u2019ve seen a couple things recently from him. But also, if you look at the fights Lima has had in the run-up, he\u2019s had just three rounds in the lead up.\"\n\n\"Rory has had two wars and in between that he\u2019s had a few weeks turnaround. He tends to take a lot of damage as well. So there\u2019s lots of things that are in Lima\u2019s favour. But then again, Rory is Rory. He has the ability. One thing we\u2019ve all seen from Lima is that anytime he has lost, he\u2019s come back, changed something and been the more dominant fighter in the rematch.\"\n\n\"I think he can definitely do that again. He knows exactly what MacDonald\u2019s going to be looking for. If he\u2019s a bit more on the front foot, I think he definitely wins that fight.\u201d\n\nPage trains at London Shootfighters, the same gym from which former England and Lions rugby union star James Haskell is preparing to launch a career as an MMA heavyweight, on the Bellator roster. \u201cHaskell has had an interest in MMA for a long time. Anytime he was in his off season he was in our gym, he\u2019s always had that curiosity. They train hard in rugby. For you to have your off season and come and do MMA, shows you\u2019re genuinely interested.\"\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t surprise me that now that he doesn\u2019t have the rugby he\u2019d want to try a fight. He\u2019s a lovely person, but he\u2019s not taking himself so seriously. He just genuinely wants to see how well he can do. He\u2019s definitely going to be tough enough. Rugby guys are always ridiculously strong.\"\n\n\"And he\u2019s with the right guys at Shootfighters. The coaches there will not let him fight if he\u2019s not ready. They won\u2019t be biased, and they will be honest. That\u2019s what he needs. I see him every day now. He\u2019s got a good energy. He\u2019s not claiming to be a fighter, he\u2019s just claiming he wants to learn to be a fighter, which is great.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason I say he\u2019s not going to be a joke, it\u2019s got nothing to do with him. It\u2019s my coaches, the coaches there. They will not allow their name to be associated with somebody who is going to disrespect their gym. They\u2019d just tell him to go to another gym who wanted it for the promotion. My coaches, it you know them, don\u2019t care about promotion. They\u2019re not the kind of coaches who want to be on camera. In fact, they hate it. They do this purely for the love of it. You can tell their intent will be genuine. They will be honest. A lot of rugby guys tend to be strong MMA fighters. Look at Mike Shipman, he came from rugby as well and he\u2019s a very strong fighter.\u201d\n\nElsewhere here at Bellator Dublin, doubling on a deep card as a secondary Bellator 227 event, bantamweight headliner James Gallagher, bristling with confidence ahead of his fight with late replacement Roman Salazar, offered his views on Brexit and borders, intimating that he would like to fight in the UK next year.\n\nGallagher is likely to receive another riveting reception at the 3Arena, and is one of sixteen Straight Blast Gym (SBG) fighters on the card under coach John Kavanagh, the talismanic figure who oversaw the rise of Conor McGregor, with whispers here that one of the sport's biggest figures could be returning to action in December. McGregor has fought just twice in three years, against Floyd Mayweather Jr, and Khabib Nurmagomedov, both defeats.\n\nThe media day was followed by the announcement that an all-British grudge fight had been signed between middleweight prospect Fabian Edwards will fight London Shootfighters standout Mike Shipman on a card at Wembley's SSE Arena on November 23. Shipman\u2019s 13-fight win streak came to an end earlier this year, but the fight will ostensibly be for bragging rights within the middleweight division in Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, Terry Brazier, the former paratrooper who achieved two world titles under the BAMMA promotion, will go head-to-head against S\u00f8ren Bak on the same card. The 27-year-old from Denmark, departs Cage Warriors as their current lightweight and interim featherweight champion to join Bellator. It was McGregor who held both Cage Warriors titles before he joined the UFC. Several other fights will also be on the Bellator card on November 23, with the main event to be announced in the coming week, according David Green, head of Bellator in the UK.\n\nBellator Dublin/Bellator 227 is live on Channel 5 from 10pm on Friday night in the UK, with the rest of the card on tape delay on Sky Sports from 2am.", "description": "Michael 'Venom' Page has set his stall out to humiliate Richard Kiely and \"show him how little he is\" in front of his home crowd here at the 3Arena on Friday night.
