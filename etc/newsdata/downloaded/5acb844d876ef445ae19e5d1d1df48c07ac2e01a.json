Police said \u201cradical protesters\u201d lobbed gasoline bombs and damaged property outside the government offices, and aimed laser beams at a helicopter, posing \u201ca serious threat to everyone\u201d in the area.\n\nProtests calling for democratic reforms have become an almost weekly occurrence since early June. Organizers said 200,000-300,000 turned out for Saturday\u2019s protests, though police did not give a definitive number.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: HONG KONG FREEDOM FIGHTERS NEED AND DESERVE US SUPPORT\n\nSaturday's demonstration took place three days before the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which has led to fear of bloody clashes in the midst of Beijing\u2019s celebrations. The rally was called to mark the fifth anniversary of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, in which protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the downtown area for 79 days beginning Sept. 28 to demand direct elections for the city's leaders but failed to win any government concessions.\n\nMore than 1,000 of the protesters streamed onto a main road, with some veering off to target the government buildings. Police initially used a hose to fire pepper spray when some protesters began throwing bricks. Police later used a water cannon truck to fire a blue liquid, used to identify protesters, and fired tear gas after protesters lobbed gasoline bombs through the barriers.\n\nTHIRD LIBYA STRIKE IN EIGHT DAYS KILLS 17 ISIS TERRORISTS, US MILITARY SAYS\n\nWe think we will lose because their force is so strong,\u201d said 22-year-old demonstrator Sang Chan. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do anything now, we\u2019ll have no other chance.\u201d\n\nSome protesters stomped on images of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. At one of the gates to Lam's office, the Chinese word for \"hell\" and an arrow pointing to the building were spray-painted on the sidewalk.\n\nA government spokesperson said universal suffrage is a right enshrined in Hong Kong\u2019s constitution, but called for peaceful dialogue. The spokesperson said the government would \u201cassess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development.\u201d\n\nProtest organizers are planning \u201canti-totalitarianism\u201d rallies on Sunday in Hong Kong and more than 60 other cities worldwide to denounce what they call \u201cChinese tyranny.\u201d However, the government's biggest worry could come Tuesday, when protesters are planning a major march as China's ruling Communist Party marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. Police have banned the march, though that\u2019s unlikely to deter protesters. Pro-Beijing demonstrators have also vowed to come out.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government has canceled its scheduled fireworks demonstration and moved planned celebrations indoors.\n\n\u201cThey are not our children,\u201d China supporter Yau Mei-kwang told Reuters of the activists. \u201cBecause at this age, they should be studying, not running to the airport, hitting people, hitting the police, insulting people.

Protesters believe China is encroaching on those rights, and have called on Britain and the United States to rein in Beijing.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong which had reporetedly drawn hundreds of thousands ended early on Saturday after it took a violent turn, police said.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/HongKong928.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
