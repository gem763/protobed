Martin of JustLeadershipUSA, were inclined to accept new jails. But grassroots group like Shut Down Rikers have long rejected this plan. \u201cWe were always very clear and explicit about [opposing new jails] from the beginning,\u201d Nabil Hassein, an organizer who worked on the Shut Down Rikers campaign, said in 2018.\n\nLast September, the No New Jails NYC coalition formed, drawing members from the Shut Down Rikers campaign. They seek to close Rikers without building any new jails, and to redirect the billions planned for new jails to \u201ccommunity-driven services, harm reduction, poverty and homelessness eradication, and transformative justice,\u201d according to their alternative plan.\n\nThe coalition has drawn some significant support, for example from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in whose district Rikers sits. More than 200 public defenders (including Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, former candidate for Queens District Attorney) have signed onto the No New Jails plan. They argue that Rikers can be closed without any replacement because their incarceration could be handled in other ways: Two-thirds of the city\u2019s overall jail population is merely awaiting trial, and could be released on bail. As for the rest, another 20 percent are jailed for parole violations\u2014in other words, people who have already been punished. Very few people in New York City jails are serving a sentence: around 12 percent. \u201cTheir convictions are minor and should not require incarceration,\u201d the defenders\u2019 open letter states. Beyond just the goal of emptying Rikers, they continue, \u201cConfronting mass incarceration requires decriminalizing more offenses and eliminating or reducing more sentences.\u201d The Lippman Commission, in fact, when it recommended closing Rikers, recommended decriminalizing sex work as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s playing out now in New York City, ahead of this week\u2019s vote on new jails to replace Rikers, will reverberate across the criminal justice reform movement. Though various reform groups are aligned in many ways, they diverge regarding the directness and urgency with which they confront the cruelty of the American carceral system, which imprisons the poor and people of color in disproportionate numbers, in inhumane conditions, facing violence and abuse.\n\nOne response to jails and prisons\u2014represented in New York City right now by the No New Jails coalition\u2014is abolitionist; rather than attempt to repair what some regard as a well-intended but broken system, they see the system itself as the problem. They ask people to commit to abolishing imprisonment altogether, rather than simply ending \u201cmass\u201d or particularly inhumane forms of incarceration. It\u2019s an approach some deride as unrealistic, even to the point of pathology: In September, Ford Foundation president and Lippman commission member Darren Walker compared the \u201cno new jails\u201d position to climate change denialism. (His statement was rebuked by more than 300 Ford Foundation fellows and their allies, who back No New Jails.) Others see abolishing all prisons and jails as noble, but unimaginable. Not too long ago, this was precisely what many said about closing Rikers.\n\nAbolitionists say any plan which replaces old, crumbling jails with new ones just creates newer jails for the city to fill. Other criminal justice reformers urge abolitionists to take what the city is offering. \u201cBecause people will still be detained in New York City after Rikers is shut down, conditions of confinement must go hand in hand with the fight for decarceration,\u201d wrote Gabriel Sayegh of the Katal Center. \u201cFor people who are subject to detention, the conditions of confinement must be more humane. Rikers must be shut down, and so long as there is detention here, the City\u2019s other decrepit jails must be replaced.\u201d\n\nSome advocates even cast the No New Jails plan as a disservice to incarcerated people. \u201cApparently [No New Jails NYC] would rather oppose the city\u2019s efforts to provide more humane care for these individuals and leave them in dangerous jail settings instead,\u201d wrote Soffiyah Elijah, executive director of the Alliance of Families of Justice.\n\nThese people are all considered criminal justice reform advocates. Their conflict is itself rooted in broad agreement: the current American practice of mass incarceration must be ended. But these groups, at times, are telling different stories about what a world without incarceration looks like.\n\nIn one version of Layleen Polanco\u2019s story, she arrives at Rikers and finds corrections officers who respond to her serious health needs and accept her as a transgender woman. In another version, Polanco never set foot in Rikers, because she was never assigned bail, and could return to her court appearance of her own free will. Or perhaps a warrant was never issued for Polanco\u2019s arrest after she missed a court-appointed diversion program session. Perhaps in this New York, the police never arrest Polanco to begin with, because sex work is not a crime.\n\nAs New York now faces the newly imaginable, practical dimensions of closing a jail complex, the competing plans before the city give a glimpse into what future debates over criminal justice reform will look like. The movement is nearing the mainstream, and with that, the tension between reform and abolition remains. Advocates can agree that no person belongs in a cage on Rikers Island. But releasing them from a cage is not the same thing as freedom. The abolitionists say the goal is to get people free. They don\u2019t intend to stop at the prison walls.", "description": "On Thursday, the New York City Council will vote on shutting down the jails on Rikers Island.
