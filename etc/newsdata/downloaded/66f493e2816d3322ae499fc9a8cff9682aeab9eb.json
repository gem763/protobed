We\u2019re not really sure, but the point is, Fever-Tree Gin and Tonic Festival has just announced that DJ Chopper Reeds (Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop) will be headlining its Friday night session, playing alongside a number of other newly announced music acts.\n\nSydney indie act Milan Ring and deep house Melbournian Loure were also announced as headliners for the Saturday & Sunday sessions respectively, along with sets from instrumentalists Urban Gypsies, the awesomely named DJ Dick Cosmic, and harpist Jake Meadows. Yep. A freakin HARPIST. If the thought of sipping an exotic G&T while simultaneously grooving out to harp tunes doesn\u2019t get your liver\u2019s dick hard, then we are two different people, my friend.\n\n\u201cBUT WHAT OF THE GIN?\u201d yell the purists from their leather armchairs. Well if like some ginthusiasts, you have no interest in music that isn\u2019t Sylvia Plath poems looped sadly over ominous lo-fi beats, rest assured you\u2019ll find some solace in \u201cGin Village\u201d which will boast over a hundred local and international gins from the teams at Four Pillars, Adelaide Hills Distillery, Distillery Botanica, Hendricks, Tanqueray, and more.\n\nPunters can also be among the first to try new and unreleased gins from known suspects Archie Rose, Scapegrace, and Hendricks, as well as a non-alcoholic alt-gin from CEDERS for when you only need to appear like a tipsy writer whose book tour is quickly unravelling.\n\nTaking place in Sydney\u2019s Centennial Parklands over September 27 \u2013 29, the new Gin & Tonic Festival will also feature food trucks, gourmet hampers, and plenty of space to lay down a picnic blanket and work on your screenplay.\n\nEarly bird tickets are now sold out, so get over to their website HERE before it\u2019s too late to get yours. Every ticket includes six little gin & tonic tasters, as well as access to G&T discovery sessions and demonstrations.", "description": "Gin & tonic is getting its own dedicated festival in Sydney later this month, and there will be plenty of tunes to keep the drinkers entertained.", "authors": ["Aiden Dabbagh"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/gin-fest-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
