If you\u2019re planning on playing on XBox One or PC, you can pick up the game on Game Pass.\n\nGame Pass is a subscription service for the Xbox One that allows players to pay a monthly fee for access to hundreds of games. The back catalogue, including games like Dishonored 2 and Wolfenstein: The New Order, may be worth the eleven dollar a month subscription on its own. The Outer Worlds, which is available on Game Pass when it launches Friday, definitely makes the whole thing more enticing.\n\nThe Outer Worlds Will Rattle Your Idea Of A Perfect Planet The very first quest in The Outer Worlds, Obsidian\u2019s highly anticipated first-person RPG out October 25, asked me to make what felt like an impossible choice.

After the first month, the price goes up to eleven dollars per month. You also need to have Windows 10 and the XBox Beta app installed \u2014 the service itself is still in beta on PC. In addition to the basic deal, there's also the higher tiered Game Pass Ultimate, which includes Xbox Live Gold, PC access and Xbox access for $16 a month.\n\nIf you decide to grab Game Pass to check out this truly wonderful game, you\u2019ll also be able to pre-load it onto your system.
