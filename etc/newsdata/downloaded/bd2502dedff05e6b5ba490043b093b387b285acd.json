The companies making them tended to cater to the sliver of Americans who maintain a vegan or vegetarian diet. They were sold in health food stores, and often advertised themselves as vegan. The packaging was often hemp-themed, the lettering green, the ethos crunchy.\n\nThen, almond milk started a revolution. The product\u2014catering to health-conscious consumers, sold in the dairy case right next to the regular milk\u2014began surging in popularity, quickly followed by rice, cashew, hemp, coconut, and oat milk products. In the United States, the sale of alternative milks boomed 61 percent in just five years, while sales of dairy milk declined. Surveys have shown that consumers for alt-milks are motivated by health concerns, as well as the sense that non-dairy milks are lighter and better for the environment. But not so much by vegan-type absolutism. The majority of people buying alt-milks also buy regular-old cow\u2019s milk products.\n\nAn explosion of meat-replacement products has followed the path set by almond milk in the last few years, not just tempeh- or seitan- or soy-based products that taste nothing like meat, but meat simulacra. Beyond\u2019s chicken strips taste and shred a lot like chicken; its burgers and its sausages are, if not quite indistinguishable from real meat, awfully close. The same goes for the mayo produced by Just, formerly Hampton Creek, and the Impossible Burger. Reviewers at Food & Wine, for instance, described the Impossible Burger as \u201creally succulent and umami-y. Almost identical to beef.\u201d A number of vegans I know hate them because they taste too gamey.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Her only crime was helping her kids\n\nBut many other consumers adore them, and sales have exploded, with investors pouring more and more money into plant-based startups. At Beyond\u2019s initial public offering this year, the company raised $240 million, and its market value sits in the billions. Food giants such as Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland have made major investments in plant-based meat. All in all, more than half a billion dollars in investment poured into American plant-based dairy, egg, and meat companies in 2018. Retail sales are growing more than 20 percent year-over-year, versus just 2 percent for all retail food sales.\n\nCell-based or \u201cclean\u201d meat\u2014meaning real meat produced in labs\u2014has not become a commercial product yet. But analysts expect it to hit the shelves in 2021 or soon after, and start-ups in this space, like Memphis Meats, have raised tens of millions of dollars. One 2018 survey found that a third of American consumers, along with half of Indian and two-thirds of Chinese consumers, would be \u201cvery or extremely likely\u201d to purchase cell-based meat.", "description": "Plant-based-food entrepreneurs are marketing their meatless products to omnivores.", "authors": ["Annie Lowrey", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTSS2UR/facebook.jpg?1569013987", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
