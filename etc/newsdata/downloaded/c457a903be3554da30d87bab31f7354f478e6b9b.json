The IOC claim the move should see temperatures 5-6C cooler during the day than in Tokyo.\n\nBritain\u2019s Tom Bosworth, who finished seventh in the 20km race walk in Doha, said: \u201cGreat to see the athletes/officials/spectators are more of a priority in Tokyo over Doha, but slightly disappointed to see it moved so far from the actual Olympics.\u201d", "description": "Olympic organisers have taken drastic measures to avoid a repeat of shocking scenes seen at the recent World Athletics Championships by moving the Tokyo 2020 marathons and race walks to Sapporo \u2013 more than 800 kilometres away from the host city.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Gareth A Davies"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/olympics/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212144843-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7FAR-Mr95yUA9tz5mE9Efrw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
