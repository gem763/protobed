At the funeral of an elderly friend, an acquaintance seated next to me in the church pew patted my knee and whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t quit wondering, have you figured out why he did it?\u201d\n\nAt another gathering, while standing in a cluster of people engaged in small talk, a young woman said, as if she was asking whether I washed my whites in hot or cold water, \u201cPeggy, did you see any sign it was coming?\u201d\n\nFor months the questions, like fiery arrows, came \u2014 in the grocery store, in airport security lines, in restaurant restrooms. I began avoiding people I didn\u2019t know well. When unwanted queries caught me off guard, my replies grew understated and were clearly unsatisfying. \u201cNo, I was stunned,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cI don\u2019t fully understand why he did it.\u201d Or \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see signs it was coming.\u201d\n\nBut as I would drive away alone in my car, I\u2019d rehearse what I wished I could have said.\n\n\u201cSure, I saw it coming,\u201d I\u2019d snap, pounding my fist on the dashboard. \u201cThere were little nooses hanging all over our house and I just ignored them!\u201d\n\nTruth is, no one saw it coming. My husband was bright and sociable, an adoring father and husband. His humor made him the life of the party. His own battles with depression led him to help countless others find the assistance they needed to overcome it. But like many accomplished men, Mark was good at masking his feelings and powering through his bouts of despair. His fateful mistake was failing to reach for help when he needed it most.\n\nOver time, I\u2019ve found a way to protect myself when people ask me how and why my husband died. I pause to leave the question suspended in awkward silence. Then I say gently and firmly, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m really comfortable discussing with you.\u201d\n\nThe kindest thing anyone ever said to me may also have been the most painful.\n\nAt an impromptu gathering of Mark\u2019s college friends in Chicago, one of his former roommates, whom I hadn\u2019t seen in years, pulled me aside quietly, put a hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve never told anyone but I think it might be a comfort to you.\u201d He described the days he\u2019d come home after class to find Mark, captain of the college ice hockey team, weeping in inexplicable darkness, wishing he were dead.", "description": "Along with everything else, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the stigma of becoming a widow this way.", "authors": ["Peggy Wehmeyer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12wehmeyer/12wehmeyer-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
