There\u2019s a mobile with Harry, Ron, and Hermione dangling over the cot, a quote from Dumbledore printed on the wall, wands placed on shelves, and a tiny Hogwarts uniform ready on a hanger for when George is big enough to wear it.\n\nWhile the cot and drawers cost \u00a3600, all the Harry Potter merch came to less than \u00a3150 (Picture: Kelsey Michael/LatestDeals.co.uk)\n\nKelsey even gave George his very own Hedwig, putting a toy owl she bought from Amazon in a cage from Wayfair and hanging it from the ceiling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project required a lot of creative thinking and bargain hunting.\n\nThat gold lamp you can see in the photos? It\u2019s actually an old lamp covered in gold wrapping paper to make it more magical.\n\nKelsey told LatestDeals.co.uk: \u2018I came up with the idea as I\u2019ve always loved Harry Potter. I love everything about it and I would love my little boy to love it just as much as me. The stories are so magical and there\u2019s nothing quite like it.\n\n\u2018I had this image in my head of how I wanted it to look, and I\u2019m so happy it does. I\u2019ve collected Harry Potter merchandise for a number of years now and I wanted to display it all, so I came up with the idea of using it all to decorate my boy\u2019s nursery.\u2019\n\nKelsey did all the work herself, even wrapping an old lamp in gold paper to make it look magical (Picture: Kelsey Michael/LatestDeals.co.uk)\n\nKelsey already had lots of Harry Potter goodies she\u2019s been gifted items over the years as family and friends knew how much she loved the franchise.\n\nShe used products from Primark, Wayfair and Amazon, and also managed to collect most of the items on the shelves from a website called Geek Gear, a subscription service that sends you Harry Potter merch every month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the cot and drawers were \u00a3600, the Harry Potter themed extra touches came to a total of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3150.\n\n\u2018It was so fun putting it all together; I enjoyed every minute,\u2019 said Kelsey. \u2018We moved into our new house at the beginning of the year and it was all a blank canvas when we first moved in, so the process didn\u2019t take too long.\n\n\u2018I started with the wall stickers, and all these ideas started coming into my head like having Hedwig in the cage hanging from the ceiling. I was lucky as it lots of the merchandise I had was gifted to me over birthdays and Christmas.\u2019\n\nHave you completed an amazing DIY project you\u2019d like to share?
