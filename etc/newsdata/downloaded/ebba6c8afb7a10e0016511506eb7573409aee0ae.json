Benett/Dave Benett/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara may be one of Hollywood\u2019s most private couples, but now we have a little bit of insight into their relationship, and, specifically, Phoenix\u2019s pet name for his rumored fianc\u00e9e. Are you ready? You might have to clutch your invisible pearls. It\u2019s \u201cfilthy dragon.\u201d\n\nPhoenix was honored with a People\u2019s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival\u2019s Tribute Gala on Monday. And during his speech, according to Us Weekly, Phoenix gave a sweet (?) shout-out to Mara: \u201cOne last thing, somewhere here, I don\u2019t know where, is a filthy dragon, and I want to rip its wings off and fasten a blanket and sleep with it forever,\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cI love you. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAt first, \u201cfilthy dragon\u201d might seem a little random, until you realize it\u2019s probably just a reference to her breakout role as Lisbeth Salander in 2011\u2019s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Okay, fine. But must he want to \u201crip its wings off?!\u201d If this is what he\u2019s saying out in the world for everybody to hear, what exactly is Joaquin Phoenix pillow talk like? Then again, I do find it all somewhat cute. Must be the goth in me.\n\nSpeaking of goth, in June the couple, who co-starred in this year\u2019s Mary Magdalene, marched for animal rights in all black while carrying dead birds.\n\nBut back to filthy dragon: Does this mean Mara\u2019s nickname for him follows the same character-inspired protocol? Please don\u2019t tell me she calls him her \u201cpsycho little clown man.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
