It's just like I'm not in her airspace at all!\n\n\"So I have a wife who just never remembers our anniversary. So I remembered I gave her a card.\"\n\nCelia, who has daughter Elise with Piers, whilst he also has three sons with his first wife, recently took to Instagram to share a sweet throwback snap from their wedding day.\n\nShe wrote: \"Nine years ago today - he just reminded me\" followed by the hashtags \"#happyanniversary #sorryiforgotagain\".\n\nWhile Piers marked the anniversary by writing: \"My most brilliant achievement was my ability to persuade my wife to marry me' \u2013 Sir Winston Churchill. I concur with that sentiment, succeeding in that achievement 8yrs ago today.\"\n\nKate Garraway\n\nAnother presenter who appeared to forget the anniversary of her nuptials was GMB host Kate Garraway .\n\nKate married former political advisor Derek Draper in 2005.\n\nShe shared a sweet photo from her big day showing Kate and Derek smiling blissfully and covered in confetti.\n\nShe wrote: \"When you are on your way home from a night out & you realise your husband has posted this wonderful thing on Facebook and you totally forgot it was your anniversary. Do I sneak in quietly?!\"\n\nBen Shephard\n\nBen tied the knot in March 2004, to Annie Perks following a nine-year relationship.\n\nThe couple have since welcomed their two sons, Jack and Sam, and share a beautiful family life together, which Ben often shares glimpses of on Instagram.\n\nEarlier this year, the telly presenter announced that he was stepping down from his long-running role on Goals to spend more time at home.\n\nHe also previously joked that another way he's kept his marriage happy was by turning down an offer to do Strictly Come Dancing .\n\nIn 2017, Ben shared a sweet anniversary post writing: \"13 years ago today I somehow managed to persuade Annie to say yes. Still amazes me to this day that she did. I'm very lucky - I do miss those SuperNoodles though.\"\n\nLaura Tobin\n\nLaura Tobin has been married to Dean Brown since 2010.\n\nIn 2017, the GMB meteorologist announced live on air that she was expecting her first child and later welcomed a baby girl, Charlotte Blossom.\n\nSpeaking of her student days in the Daily Mirror, Laura previously said: \"The thing about Dean was he didn\u2019t become too intense, send me loads of flowers, and he didn\u2019t love me more than anything on Earth.\"\n\nThe couple recently celebrated their anniversary.\n\nLaura wrote: \"Time flies-9 years ago today I got Married. Happy Anniversary to my wonderful husband. It's so nice to reminisce about the day.\n\n\"It was amazing, so much love & laughter with all our favourite people, including my beautiful bridesmaids\n\n\"I LOVED my Princess dress & cascading bouquet of orchids. I wish I could do it all over again.\"\n\nAlex Beresford\n\nAlex is married to Natalie Beresford and the couple have a son named Cruz.\n\nAlex, Natalia and Cruz are always away enjoying tropical holidays.\n\nThe couple have kept the details of their big day under wraps, but here is a photo of them looking glammed up for a friend's wedding in 2018.\n\nCharlotte Hawkins\n\nCharlotte Hawkins married her fianc\u00e9 Mark Herbert in 2008 in the stunning location of Chichester Cathedral.\n\nLast year, the newsreader and her husband Mark celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary at Raymond Blanc's Belmond Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons in Oxford.\n\nThe loved-up couple also share four-year-old daughter Ella Rose.\n\nCharlotte marked the special occasion with a sweet post dedicated to her husband.\n\nShe wrote: \"Happy 10th wedding anniversary to my fabulous husband!
