Both forces are on the lead and with no one else in between,\" he said.\n\nKaroui, on the other hand, has promised to address the needs of those most vulnerable.\n\nThe media magnate's philanthropic initiatives, broadcast on his Nessma TV channel, have won him a big following across the country.\n\nIf given a majority, his party's priority will be to enact legislation to combat poverty.\n\nBut such a result is highly unlikely, and with both Ennahdha and Qalb Tounes refusing to enter a coalition government with one another, there are fears of yet another political crisis.", "description": "Tunisians head to the polls to elect 217 new members of parliament, a week before voting in a new president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/49063f7f3ff042e9b20ce8dd7756661a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
