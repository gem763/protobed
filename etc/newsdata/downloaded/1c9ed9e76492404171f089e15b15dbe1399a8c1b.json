The couple, both with serious health problems, visited the wilderness region to improve their mental health and well-being. (Brian Vastag/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe stream burbled and sputtered, the cold of the glacial melt a refreshing bubble in the summer heat. Here, just steps from the afternoon tourist traffic on Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier National Park spoke to my soul. I was surrounded by a geologic miracle.\n\nAcross the stream, which pooled where that summer\u2019s woodfall had formed a small dam, the uplifted peaks stood as they have since around the time the dinosaurs arose. The mountains\u2019 strata \u2014 each layer the compressed sediment of an ancient seabed \u2014 shot upward, the dark boundaries of each sheet highlighted by the August sun. The whole mountain was canted like a huge table missing legs on one side. The moment lengthened. I tried to weigh a lifetime.\n\nMy wife, Beth, and I had come here to soak ourselves in a world wonder. We both have serious health problems, and study after study shows that spending time outdoors improves mental health and well-being. While such \u201cforest bathing,\u201d as the Japanese call it, is not a cure for anything, we were hoping the mountain bathing we anticipated would at least give us a boost.\n\nMinutes earlier, as we had backtracked across the park\u2019s famous road, we had stopped at an overlook we had missed that morning. The view spread across the valley, Heaven\u2019s Peak spiking in the distance. As cars pulled into the overlook, I spied a photographer working with two legs of his wooden tripod perched on the low stone retaining wall that was laid with the road in 1927. Dark-haired and hale, almost burly, he was peering at a large-format film camera. On the wall sat a worn black book of Ansel Adams photographs.\n\nI asked his name. \u201cFrank Ruggles,\u201d he said. He was working to re-create a series of photographs Adams had made in 1941. It was called the Mural Project. Adams had been hired to photograph the national parks of the West to majestically adorn the walls of the relatively new Interior Department building in Washington. World War II interceded, and Adams never finished.\n\nBut the legendary landscape photographer made many arresting images in the parks that year. Now Ruggles is reshooting them for an upcoming TV special and a coffee-table book.\n\n\n\nCrepuscular rays shine over Heaven\u2019s Peak at Glacier National Park. (Brian Vastag/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThose are crepuscular rays,\u201d Ruggles said as sun streaks broke through a puffy cloud, spotlighting a small glacier. \u201cAnd they are as rare as hens\u2019 teeth.\u201d He pulled a modern camera with a long lens from his Jeep and began clicking.\n\nAs he did, Ruggles explained further: In 2020, it will have been 79 years since Adams made his images. The average American life span is now 79 years. So Ruggles is recreating 150 of the 226 known mural photographs to showcase the changes in famous landscapes over an American lifetime. It\u2019s called the 79 Years Project.\n\nAdams left a wealth of notes to follow: Dates of images, times, type of film shot and f-stop used. But Adams did not record where, precisely, he placed his cameras. So Ruggles, worn book of the mural photographs in hand, has to sleuth out each locale by sight.\n\nToday, he had found where Adams shot Heaven\u2019s Peak. It was right here, where our paths intersected.\n\nSo Frank and I shared a moment, at about 4:45 p.m., Aug. 6, 2019. We chatted for a few more minutes, Ruggles telling me about hauling his even bigger large format camera \u2014 each negative spanning 8 inches by 10 \u2014 up from Logan Pass to Hidden Lake the day before. \u201cThat was special,\u201d he said of toting the 65-pound rig on a three-mile hike at high altitude.\n\n\n\nPhotographer Frank Ruggles works to re-create artist Ansel Adams\u2019s images of the wilderness region. (Brian Vastag/For The Washington Post)\n\nI told him I used to work as a journalist, and we talked about a few people we both know. I marveled at the meeting, this commonality, right here, now, at this microscopic intersection in space and time, amid a landscape that the world began building so long ago that nothing had yet wriggled, swam or walked on this Earth. Platters of algae fossils were all these rocks had to say about life nearly 2 billion years ago.\n\nBeth and I drove off, and next we stopped at the stream.\n\nWe had spent all day in the car, with breaks to gawk, but we are both too ill to venture on any of the Montana park\u2019s well-known hikes. The walk to the stream, however, was about as far as a squirrel can scurry in a minute, so we climbed down a few steps under the road\u2019s bridge, and just yards from the traffic we had what felt like a universe of peaks and valleys to ourselves.\n\nI found a shelf of rock to sit on \u2014 hard against my bony bottom \u2014 and listened. My father will be 79 next year; he was born the same year as the Adams project. Earlier that day, I had heard that a former science editor at the New York Times, David Corcoran, had died of leukemia at age 72. I am a week away from 48.\n\nThat mountain peak was uplifted 200 million years ago. The flowers that speckled the pathway pushed up just weeks ago. A forest fire tore through this area four years prior. The two dozen glaciers remaining in the park will be gone in a decade because of climate change.\n\nThese numbers jumbled in my mind, but the number weighing on me most was unknowable: How many years did I have left to drink in the wonders of this Earth? That\u2019s a number nobody knows of themselves, of course, but my complex medical situation leaves me with a chronically uncomfortable feeling of racing toward an early end.\n\nLast year, after years of disabling illness, I learned that I have a muscle disorder. But it\u2019s an incomplete diagnosis; the muscle tissue on the microscope slides looked terrible, a multiple-car wreck of necrotic tissue and atrophy, but not terrible in a specific enough way to finish the diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wondering about rare forms of ALS,\u201d a researcher at the National Institutes of Health told me. I had been wondering about that, too, for seven years, ever since 30 pounds of good weight \u2014 muscle \u2014 had melted off my body in a storm of twitches and fevers deep in the winter of 2012-2013. Later, the researcher decided to call my condition \u201catypical myositis,\u201d myositis being a family of inflammatory muscle disorders. But that term is more description than diagnosis. I don\u2019t know if 79 years are attainable; no doctor can tell me that.\n\nThen again, no one younger than that knows whether he or she will hit that mark.\n\nBeth embraced me and walked up the trail. I stayed and drank in the scene; a rain shadow veiled the top of a peak. As the first tears fell, so did a few fat drops of rain. My salt water mixed with the fresh from the sky, and both spattered the rock.\n\nSoon the specks would wash into the stream, join the glacial melt and run to the ocean.\n\nBrian Vastag is a former Washington Post science reporter. He now lives in Hawaii.\n\nRead more", "description": "\u201cHow many years did I have left to drink in the wonders of this Earth?\u201d he thought as he traveled through mountains of Glacier National Park formed millions of years ago.", "authors": ["Brian Vastag", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y6mYDRltXuJKvDp0EhURcgywdXE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HOHOVJGTGMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
