Find Me is a sequel to Call Me By Your Name, Andr\u00e9 Aciman\u2019s 2007 novel that became an Oscar-winning film, and it begins in the same way as Linklater\u2019s movie, but rather than the protagonists being a couple of twentysomethings, Samuel and Miranda have a greater disparity between their ages. The former, the father of the young pianist Elio from the earlier novel, is at least 30 years older than the latter.\n\nIt\u2019s a brave conceit in 2019, when any suggestion of impropriety between an older man and a younger woman is generally given short shrift, but there\u2019s no touching or hand-holding here, no lewd comments or sexual innuendo. Instead, the pair engage in a long and erudite conversation that leads them to spending the day together and waiting no more than a few hours to agree that theirs is the greatest love affair since Orpheus first set eyes on Eurydice.\n\nHaving read much of Aciman\u2019s work, I find his writing intriguing and maddening in equal parts. While the elegance of his prose and the sophistication of his characters are to be admired, his creations rarely seem human, speaking in a pompous fashion where everyone, regardless of age or circumstance, is intimately familiar with classical music and philosophy. Love lies at the heart of his books, but as a concept rather than a reality. No one in an Aciman novel can ever just go on a few dates and see how things work out. Instead they know from their first interaction that they\u2019re destined to be together, revelling in the authenticity of their affections. Ultimately, it does not make them seem evolved but narcissistic, shallow and a little immature.\n\nIf the reader wants to shout, 'Oh grow up, you\u2019ve only just met!' at the characters, then something\u2019s gone awry\n\nThe same problems weakened his previous novel, Enigma Variations, where the central character Paul fell in love with five different people across the story, declaring each one to be the great love of his life before chucking them in favour of the next. Here, Samuel and Miranda are planning their future together before the guard has even checked their tickets. In fact, within hours of meeting, the pair discuss having children, buy monogrammed mugs, consider getting matching tattoos and she introduces him to her father. I\u2019m as romantic as the next guy but there\u2019s a fine line between passion and recklessness. \u201cIs this going too fast for you?\u201d Miranda asks him, and it\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s going too fast for me and I\u2019m not even in the relationship.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andr\u00e9 Aciman.

The second concerns the burgeoning relationship between Elio and a much older man, Michel, whom he meets at a concert. The conversations and the romance play out in much the same way as they do between Samuel and Miranda, with a neat line about the ageing lotharios eventually having to compete over who is the younger. Elio and Michel speak for the first time during the concert\u2019s intermission and by the time the musicians have gathered for the second act, they too are besotted, expressing sentiments of love that might sound excessive on a wedding day. Novels don\u2019t have to reflect real life, they can elevate the quotidian into something heightened and beautiful, but if the reader wants to shout, \u201cOh grow up, you\u2019ve only just met!\u201d at the characters, then something\u2019s gone awry.\n\nThe final and shortest section features Oliver, the previous great love of Elio\u2019s life, who is now deeply in love with several other people but dreaming that the young pianist\u2019s hands are still tickling his ivories. Fans of Call Me By Your Name will be disappointed to learn that the two lovers never meet in Find Me, but as both are determined to track each other down, one can only assume that a third novel is on the way.\n\nIt\u2019s annoying to feel such frustration with a writer who is as gifted a stylist as Aciman, and whose work is centred around that most basic of human needs, love. Characters in a novel should never feel like characters in a novel and too often here, they do. This is a shame considering his preoccupations are relatable and his descriptions of Rome and life on the continent are beautifully drawn, as evocative as anything you might find in EM Forster. But honestly, if one of these characters ended up in a train carriage with me and tried to start a conversation, I\u2019d grab my things and go in search of an empty seat.\n\n\u2022 Find Me is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).
