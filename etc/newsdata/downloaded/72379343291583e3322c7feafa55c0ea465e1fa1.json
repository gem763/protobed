The last vote was described as once in a generation.\"\n\nStanding up against politics of Trump and Johnson\n\nThe first minister urged her party to stand up to the \"crude populism\" she said was espoused by leaders including Boris Johnson and Donald Trump.\n\nShe cited the Supreme Court's ruling that the prime minister had acted unlawfully when he attempted to shut down parliament in September, as well as the US president's decision to withdraw troops from the Syrian border last week which has sparked a brutal conflict in the region.\n\n\"Here in the UK, we have a prime minister who has acted unlawfully, and shown no concern for the human consequences of his disastrous Brexit policy,\" she said.\n\n\"Across the Atlantic, the current incumbent of the White House has casually allowed a war in the Middle East to re-erupt.\"\n\n\"What leaders like Boris Johnson and Donald Trump have in common is this: a belief that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of their own self-interest.\n\n\"Not contrary opinions that might challenge the notion that they \u2013 and only they \u2013 speak for the people. Not facts or evidence. Not the rule of law. Not even democracy. In some cases, not even basic human rights.\"\n\nShe added: \"Crude populism tramples on the rights of minorities and tears at the very fabric of our democracy. It is not for us. That is not who we are.\"\n\nSturgeon has previously described some of Trump's views as \"deeply abhorrent,\" and said she was \"not prepared to be a politician that maintains a diplomatic silence in the face of racism, misogyny or hatred of any kind.\"", "description": "Nicola Sturgeon announces that she will demand a second independence referendum for Scotland 'within weeks.'", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5c3a3cc4a0a28026a9f82?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
