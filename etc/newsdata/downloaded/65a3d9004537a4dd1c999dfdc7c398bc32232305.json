Katie Hill Reportedly in 'Throuple' Relationship", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was allegedly involved in a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with one of her female staffers and later went on to have an extramarital affair with her former finance director, a report from RedState claims.\n\nRedState obtained text messages and photos which allegedly suggest that Rep. Katie Hill \u2014 who is currently undergoing divorce proceedings \u2014 carried out a two-year relationship with one of her female staffers, who was hired in 2017. Hill\u2019s husband, Kenny Heslep, was reportedly part of the \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship, a term used to describe three individuals involved in a consensual romantic relationship.\n\nAccording to RedState, the three \u2014 Hill, Heslep, and the young female staffer \u2014 \u201ctook multiple vacations together, including to Alaska, where this photograph was taken.\u201d The image referenced allegedly shows a censored image of Hill brushing the staffer\u2019s hair in the nude. Other images allegedly show Hill and the staffer kissing.\n\nAccording to RedState, the \u201cthrouple\u2019s\u201d relationship changed once Hill moved to D.C., and Hill \u201cbroke off her relationships with both Heslep and the staffer, claiming she wanted to focus on \u2018this important work\u2019 and that it wasn\u2019t fair to be involved in a relationship.\u201d The outlet shared screenshots of text messages allegedly between Hill and the staffer, who was \u201cdistraught and trying to figure out how to move on with her life.\u201d\n\nIn one text, the staffer asks Hill if she ended their relationship due to the \u201cpolitical risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I mean I guess maybe partially. Honestly, though, it\u2019s that I want to be alone,\u201d Hill allegedly replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be accountable to anyone else. I want to be entirely focused on this work that I think is so important.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not fair to anyone as a partner,\u201d the text reads.\n\n\u201cRedState was also provided with intimate photographs of the women, which we have chosen not to publish,\u201d the outlet added.\n\nAs RedState reported:\n\nA review of FEC records for Hill\u2019s 2018 and 2020 campaigns reveals that the staffer was first paid in November 2017, with her payment classified as \u201csalary,\u201d making her an employee. California law doesn\u2019t expressly prohibit consensual sexual relationships between an employer and a direct report, but it\u2019s certainly a murky legal and ethical area. Some legal pundits contend that an employee can\u2019t truly consent to a sexual relationship with the person who signs their paycheck.\n\nAfter Hill ended the \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship, her husband, Heslep, was told \u201cby numerous sources\u201d that his wife was having an extramarital affair with another staffer \u2014 Graham Kelly, now her legislative director. He filed for divorce after finding out about the affair, purportedly enraged that she cheated on him with a man and not a woman.\n\nA post from Heslep reads:\n\nOut lesbian?!? Then why has she been sleeping with her (male) finance director for the past yer at least? I couldn\u2019t dispute this if she was still holding too being bisexual. But but being with her husband (me_ for almost 15 years and then living me for another MAN, not woman, whom she is still seeing, is not her being a lesbian. Bisexual yes, as I will back up her claims to this. But not lesbian alone.\n\nHe also clarified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t file for divorce bc she was bi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t know she opened our relationship. Lol. We also aren\u2019t officially divorced yet bc she has been fighting everything this whole time,\u201d he allegedly wrote.\n\nRedState framed the publication of Hill\u2019s sexual escapades by noting her role on both the Oversight and Reform and Armed Service committees and the national security implications it brings.\n\n\u201cIf people who don\u2019t have our nation\u2019s best interests at heart had access to the photographs, text messages, and other information provided to RedState, Rep. Hill would be an easy blackmail target,\u201d RedState wrote, adding that Hill\u2019s office has yet to issue a comment on the dramatic allegations.", "description": "Rep.
