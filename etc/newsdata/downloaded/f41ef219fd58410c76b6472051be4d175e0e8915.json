Turkey and Russia agree to joint patrols in Syria", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Russia and Turkey agreed Tuesday to take joint control of a vital strip of territory along the Syria-Turkey border, a victory for Moscow as the U.S. military continued its withdrawal from Syria.\n\nThe pact between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, came shortly before a U.S.-brokered cease-fire \u2013 which had temporarily halted a Turkish attack on Kurdish forces in Syria \u2013 expired Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Putin-Erdogan deal gives Russia a crucial foothold in the Middle East amid a power vacuum created by the U.S. withdrawal. Under the agreement, Russia and Turkey agreed to work together to remove Kurdish fighters from a 20-mile zone in northern Syria.\n\n\"Both Russia and Turkey got exactly what they want,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said during a hearing on the Trump administration's policy Tuesday.\n\nDuring that hearing, President Donald Trump's top envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, faced a barrage of pointed questions from senators in both parties on the president's decision to withdraw from Syria, which many have said was a betrayal of the Kurdish fighters who helped America defeat the Islamic State's caliphate in the country.\n\n\"It is clear that the United States has been sidelined,\u201d Menendez said, calling Trump's policy a \"capitulation\" to Turkey.\n\n\u201cRussia and the murderous Assad regime are calling the shots,\" said Menendez, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \"We don\u2019t even have clarity about whether and where U.S. troops might remain.\"\n\nJeffrey acknowledged he was \"not personally consulted\" before Trump announced his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. Lawmakers said that demonstrated the \"chaotic and ad hoc\" nature of Trump's policy in the region.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, pressed Jeffrey on Trump's Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan, in which the Turkish president told Trump he planned to invade Syria. Trump said then that he would remove American troops stationed on the Turkish-Syria border, which many said gave Erdogan the green light to attack the Kurds.\n\n\"Erdogan basically said, 'I'm coming in, get out of the way' and America blinked,\" Romney said.\n\nJeffrey pushed back, saying Trump warned Erdogan not to invade Syria and did not give him a green light to attack the Kurds. He said American forces in Syria were never given a mission to defend the Kurds against an attack from Turkey, which is a NATO ally.\n\nHe said Erdogan's decision came despite \"warning after warning\" and \"incentive after incentive\" from the Trump administration to stave off such a move.\n\nKurdish forces controlled much of northeastern Syria until two weeks ago, when Turkey invaded and began pushing them south. Under the U.S.-brokered cease-fire, the Kurdish fighters agreed to pull back deeper into Syria, and Turkey agreed to stop its assault.\n\nIf the terms of the cease-fire are ratified by all sides, Trump will lift sanctions he imposed on Turkey earlier this month and Turkey will not advance further into Syria.\n\nJeffrey defended the cease-fire, saying it has limited Turkey's territorial gains in Syria \u2013 and the chaos that unleashed. But he conceded that hundreds of Kurdish fighters have died in the two-week-long incursion and that ISIS fighters have taken advantage of the mayhem.\n\nHe estimated that \"dozens\" of ISIS fighters \u2013 who had been captured by the Kurds \u2013 have escaped amid the upheaval created by Turkey's incursion.\n\nTurkey's invasion has \"scrambled\" the situation in Syria, undercut U.S. efforts against ISIS and \"brought in the Russians and the Syrian regime forces in a way that is really tragic for everybody involved,\u201d Jeffrey said. But Turkey itself, he said, has not gained much for its incursion.\n\nThe U.S. envoy said 10,000 captured ISIS fighters remain in Syria and their detention could be jeopardized \"if things goes south\" with the cease-fire.\n\nAbout three hours before the cease-fire deadline, Gen. Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the top commander of the Syrian Kurdish forces, sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence saying he had withdrawn all his forces from a Turkish-controlled \"safe zone\" inside Syria.", "description": "Amid a U.S. military withdrawal from Syria, the Trump administration's ability to address the Syria crisis seemed dramatically diminished.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E7CAYDrD4BW6QyFsn51ZBA--~B/aD01OTY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/44ea434b17cf49508e8ae2d0f4246388", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
