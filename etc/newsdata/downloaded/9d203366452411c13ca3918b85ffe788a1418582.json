Or that was the idea.\n\nIn truth, many were already in Westminster for meetings and events that had been scheduled long before the government decided it had had enough of parliamentary democracy for a few weeks.\n\nThe group gathered outside the St Stephens entrance to the Palace of Westminster \u2013 the same spot where, seemingly a lifetime ago, hardline Tory Brexiteers had declared their opposition to Theresa May and her Brexit deal.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow, it was the anti-Brexit MPs\u2019 turn. Thirty or so of them stood stony-faced and solemn, to condemn Johnson and his apparent dislike of parliamentary scrutiny. It was a photo opportunity designed to make a clear point: even though the government has sent us packing, MPs are still here.\n\nJo Swinson was there, Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty and Hilary Benn, new Lib Dem MPs Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman. More joined as it went on.\n\nAnd yet for all the anger, there was really not much they could do. Despite talk of a House of Commons sit-in, there was no grand gesture.\n\nUltimately it was all largely futile. Parliament is still suspended, MPs have little to do beyond carrying on with their meetings, returning to their constituencies and planning their next move. It is not entirely clear what that will be.\n\nAll eyes now turn to the Supreme Court next Tuesday, where the UK\u2019s most senior judges will decide whether or not the prime minister\u2019s request for the Queen to prorogue parliament was lawful.\n\nShould the court rule against the government, it is unclear what exactly would happen next. Johnson\u2019s team believes the Privy Council would have to reconvene to set a new date for parliament to sit, but others in government say the suspension would effectively be declared void and MPs could resume sitting immediately.\n\nFor now, though, the battle has shifted from being a political to a legal one. For all their angry words, no MP can overturn the decision to close down parliament. Only the judges can do that. Whether they will, will become clear next week.\n\nYours\n\nBenjamin Kentish\n\nPolitical correspondent", "description": "The MPs came from every corner of the kingdom to decry Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament.
