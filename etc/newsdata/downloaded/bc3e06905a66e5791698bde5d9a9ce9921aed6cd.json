The government inquiry will certainly spook shareholders and also give them a flurry of bad press before their final showdown with Sandy and Stewy.\n\nWhile Shiv and Kendall help Logan hold things down in D.C., Roman, flanked by Karl and Laird, takes a trip to Turkey to secure foreign money as a last effort at avoiding the takeover bid. Roman\u2019s trip goes about as badly as the D.C. trip: They both get, to borrow a phrase, \u201ca B+, meaning bad plus terrible.\u201d Here\u2019s where the Roys stand after the events of \u201cD.C.\u201d\n\nShiv Roy\n\nShiv sashayed around D.C. this week and took one for the team. It was deeply uncomfortable to watch her pull off her heels on a children\u2019s playground, as she tried to talk the cruises victim out of testifying. But somehow, she pulled it off? She was very earnest and convincing: Her dad is a serial liar, and no one should trust him, and he\u2019ll do or say whatever he has to to keep control of his company. Shiv\u2019s motives aren\u2019t entirely clean \u2014 she is manipulating this woman\u2019s silence \u2014 but she\u2019s making the pitch she\u2019s always made: She wants to clean up the company and run it properly.\n\nKendall Roy\n\nKendall almost made it to the top this week, and very narrowly missed out. He did exactly what Publicist Fisher Stevens\u00ae (I\u2019m not sure why Fisher Stevens being on this show tickles me to no end, but it does) advised: Chew up all their time so they can\u2019t really make a case against you. \u201cI\u2019d say go ahead. Hit us as hard as you can,\u201d he told Senator Eavis. \u201cWe can take it. We have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nLogan didn\u2019t exactly flounder during the hearing, but he certainly slouched, directing all questions to Kendall \u2014 and the son outperformed the father. He was great! All bluster, no protein, and won the family another day at the helm. But this is a shorter victory than Shiv\u2019s: She dodged a meteor, he just won one day of the news cycle. I love that Kendall, who looks like he\u2019s one puff of Nasonex from the grave, still has the capacity to surprise us. But I have an acknowledged Shiv bias, so no top spot for him this week.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make a Tomelette without breaking some Greggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent the same email to him 67 times in one evening,\u201d Senator Eavis tells Tom, before he asks if he\u2019s ever used another human being as furniture and after he asks if Tom knows Gregory Hirsh. I love that Succession never actually showed us a scene of Tom emailing Greg five dozen times in one night. Instead we get to hear about it here, when it\u2019s most humiliating, read aloud to everyone else in the Roy family and everyone else in the world.\n\nLogan Roy\n\nThe Roy family is like a traveling circus these days, fools everywhere they go! This week they\u2019ve landed in D.C. and Logan knows their display was enough to keep them breathing, but not nearly enough to win. Logan has two star pupils in Kendall and Shiv, who really outdid themselves this week, another star pupil who happens to maybe be held captive in Turkey (albeit with a big bounty), and Rhea played right into Shiv\u2019s plan and decamped quickly once the shit hit the fan. Logan seems more alone now than ever, and also more insecure. After he read his statement about feeling so sorry for all the dirty dealings in cruises, he shut down and pushed the questions to Kendall. It\u2019s a betrayal that we\u2019ve come to expect from him, but I expected him to put up a better \u2014 or at least louder \u2014 show of strength.\n\nGerri Killman\n\nContrary to popular belief, the phrase \u201cGOAT\u201d doesn\u2019t stand for Greatest of All Time, it stands for Gerri Over All The-rest! Gerri\u2019s right about their tactic when it comes to dealing with the cruises drama: Say the family didn\u2019t know, and say the buck stops with Bill. Is anyone else on this show as cool as a cucumber like Gerri? She\u2019s a sniper! Now I need her to get on the phone with the Turkish government about freeing Roman.\n\nRoman Roy\n\nAll of the Roy kids put on great displays this episode: Shiv earned the cruise victim\u2019s confidence, Kendall held court during the Senate hearing, and Roman\u2019s trip to Turkey looks like it will get the family enough cash to take the company private. (I really have so little idea of what that means in reality, but at least it sounded promising when Logan said it.) Better yet for Roman, he managed to bond a little bit with Karl and Laird, and he needs two more people to take him seriously. Yes, Roman\u2019s field trip to secure foreign billions was a great success \u2014 soccer-team pep talk aside \u2014 until it turned into a \u2026 hostage situation? Well, you win some, you lose some.\n\nMarcia Roy\n\nWhere! Is! Marcia! I\u2019m surprised that she wasn\u2019t at least in the D.C. conference room to support Logan, but maybe it\u2019s time he misses her for a change. I have complicated feelings about Marcia, but I will say it: Leave him, sis!\n\nCousin Greg\n\nPoor Cousin Greg and his paltry $5 million! That\u2019s not enough money to do anything with, according to Connor and Tom, two men with more money than me. Last week he decided to side with Uncle Fun over Grandpa Grumps, and now Congress can\u2019t keep his name out of their mouths. Maybe he\u2019ll go rogue and whistle-blow himself, but probably not. Meanwhile, I\u2019m still curious about that junior-executive uprising it looked like he was organizing two weeks ago \u2026\n\nBill Lockhart\n\nThe D.C. agenda was to kill Bill, but Bill showed up to remind the family that he\u2019s still got tricks up his sleeve. He didn\u2019t threaten Logan when he reminded him about the shadow logs and the paper trail, but he certainly made his position clear: He\u2019s very nice, but he might not go down as easy as Gerri & Co. would like to think.\n\nTom Wambsgans\n\nI wish I could bottle up my screech when Tom \u2014 lovely, idiotic Tom \u2014 was asked about Lester being nicknamed \u201cMo,\u201d and he replied, \u201cHe just seemed \u2026 a bit \u2026 like one. Maybe. But we didn\u2019t know anything!\u201d Tom\u2019s Senate testimony goes from bad to very bad to Interstellar-bad to absolutely horrific. Tom is just as ruthless as any of the Roys, which I think is often overlooked, but he really can be twice as hapless. Of all the Waystar speakers this week, he gave the worst showing by far, and I don\u2019t expect Logan to forget it.\n\nConnor Roy\n\nConnor didn\u2019t fuck anything up on this episode \u2014 not the family fortune or Broadway or the United States \u2014 but that\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t fully appreciate his contributions this week. That little \u201coh yeah,\u201d he pulled after Kendall\u2019s testimony? A chef\u2019s kiss!\n\nRhea Jarrell\n\nWhen Rhea showed up to Logan\u2019s apartment after that whistle-blower interview, she looked like she had one stiletto in the grave. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be the new bride,\u201d she told Logan. \u201cRearranging the bachelor\u2019s apartment, putting flowers out. It\u2019s just not nice to think you\u2019ll find a corpse in the freezer.\u201d Girl \u2014 do you hear yourself? C\u2019est dramatique! When push comes to shove \u2014 and by \u201cpush comes to shove\u201d I mean the shitshow at the fuck factory we know as \u201cCongress\u201d \u2014 Rhea really doesn\u2019t have it in her. She can spritz perfume over the shit, but she can\u2019t shovel it! She pitches her aversion to confronting the cruises victim as more noble, but really she\u2019s looking out for herself yet again.\n\nThe \u201cCon-heads\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry but anyone legitimately voting for Connor Roy belongs at the very bottom of any and every power ranking.
