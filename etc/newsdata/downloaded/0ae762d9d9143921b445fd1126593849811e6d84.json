Now they find themselves scattered around the world, living in five different countries, facing five different futures.\n\nAcross the Middle East, the situations of the more than 5 million Syrian refugees created by the civil war, already precarious, has deteriorated in recent months. In Turkey, Syrians now face the prospect of being resettled inside a \u201csafe zone\u201d prised from Kurdish control.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy is reeling, and as Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces tighten a siege around Idlib, Syria\u2019s last rebel-held province, senior Lebanese officials say it is time for refugees who fled there to return home.\n\nFor one family of five brothers, from the southern Syrian province of Dara\u2019a, this growing pressure on Syrian refugees is widening the gulf between where each man has found himself, nearly nine years since protests against the Assad regime erupted.\n\nRami, Lebanon\n\nWhen his brother went to work one morning in July and never returned, Rami guessed he might have been detained by Lebanese authorities. That wasn\u2019t unusual: Syrians without official papers were frequently picked up in Beirut and released after a few days.\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t resurface, Rami called the local office of the UN\u2019s refugee agency. There was no record of Hassan in Lebanese custody, they told him, and he should urgently call the Red Cross. \u201cI started to get scared,\u201d Rami says. \u201cI thought: this is a big deal.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, he received a call from a Syrian number. Hassan sounded exhausted. He had just been released from weeks of detention at a branch of Syria\u2019s feared military intelligence directorate.\n\nSince April, the Lebanese government has launched a concerted drive to demolish concrete homes in refugee camps and raided businesses to flush out Syrians working illegally. At least 2,700 people have been deported from Lebanon, including at least seven confirmed to have been arrested upon their return to Syria. Hassan is one such case.\n\nSince his brother\u2019s arrest Rami, 30, rarely leaves the two-room home he shares with his wife and two daughters in a southern Beirut suburb.\n\nIn 2012, he was still a student. When Syrian soldiers entered his neighbourhood, and some of his brothers fled south to Jordan, he weighed his options. There was no way he could study or work in Jordan. \u201cSo I stayed, and thought, when things calm down and the situation improves, I want to have my degree,\u201d he says.\n\nAny hope the revolution would be swift had vanished by 2015, the year the Free Syrian Army recaptured his neighbourhood and Rami returned home. For three years, he says, he worked with humanitarian organisations to deliver food and medicine.\n\nLike most Syrian men, he was obliged to serve in the national army. His call-up date came and went. Eventually, a warrant was issued in his name. When the Syrian military recaptured his neighbourhood in June 2018, it was time to flee.\n\nBeirut is providing little refuge. He fears he could leave the house one day to buy groceries and not return. His family would have no way of knowing if he had been arrested.\n\n\u201cEvery week I ask the UN if I can go [from Lebanon],\u201d Rami says. \u201cIf there was a path through the sea, I\u2019d take it. I just don\u2019t want to be scared anymore. My brother Hassan was an old guy, he had an injury. And they still took him back. So why wouldn\u2019t they take me?\u201d\n\nShould he be deported, he would be forced to join the Syrian army at the very least. That would be better than the alternative: being punished for the actions of his older brother, Kareem.\n\nKareem, Sweden\n\nKareem was renowned across his neighbourhood for his beautiful handwriting. In peacetime, he would write shop signs and posters in his elegant Arabic script. When the revolution started in 2011, he lent his brush to the signs the protesters carried calling for the downfall of the regime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kareem working in a barber\u2019s shop in Vimmerby, Sweden. Photograph: Anna Hallams/The Guardian\n\nSoon he graduated to filming protests and the aftermath of regime violence and sending the footage to TV stations in the Gulf. When he started to appear in some of the videos, providing commentary or interviewing victims, he knew the possible consequences. \u201cThe regime is going to know my name, my picture. They will have a file on me and the people I know.\u201d\n\nHe dispatched his family to Jordan but stayed in Dara\u2019a to film the fighting. For two years, Kareem shuttled between safe houses. But he was being hunted, he says. \u201cThe regime started to know where I slept.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, from Amman, Kareem, 45, applied for asylum in Europe. He was approved six months later and settled in Vimmerby, Sweden, with his wife and three children. They had a fourth child, a girl, over there. \u201cShe knows nothing about Syria, her family, her history,\u201d he says.\n\nIt is not yet a happy ending. He works two jobs to send money to his brothers in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. He is wracked with worry about the dangers they still face, especially Hassan. \u201cHe was imprisoned because of me,\u201d Kareem says. \u201cHe was only carrying the family name. I was the reason he was there.\u201d\n\nFarid, in Jordan, and Samir, in Germany\n\n\u201cRight there, that\u2019s the Israeli border,\u201d Farid says from the balcony of a Spanish-style villa on Jordan\u2019s northern edge. The unfinished house has two pools, marble stairs and a backyard dotted with palm trees. Farid has been hired off the books to build the home; he sleeps beside his son on thin mats on the floor.\n\nHe left Syria in 2013, walking six hours under shelling and in darkness in a vast convoy of 1,500 families. Most were separated from each other on the way. \u201cYou had no idea who was around you,\u201d Farid, 54, says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t dare use our cell phones, even to light a cigarette, in case somebody saw the light.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Farid, who left in Syria in 2013, at the house he is working on in Jordan. Photograph: Asmahan Bkerat/The Guardian\n\nJordan\u2019s economy is sluggish and protests over the cost of living are growing. Yet the country has loosened some work regulations for Syrian refugees, and says it will not deport anyone against their wishes.\n\nFor a few months in 2015 Farid, Kareem and another brother, Samir, were in Jordan together. They debated whether to join the thousands of Syrians chancing a trip to Europe. It was too dangerous, Farid said. Samir was insistent: what was the alternative?\n\n\u201cMy kid was six years old and hadn\u2019t learned to read,\u201d Samir, 39, says from Germany, where he now lives. \u201cA man needs to provide for his family, live safely.\u201d\n\nHe gathered together enough money for an airplane ticket to Turkey, from where he paid a smuggler $1,200 (\u00a3930) for a seat on a rickety boat to Greece. \u201cPeople were stacked on top of each other and could barely move,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe kept praying it wouldn\u2019t break down or take on too much water.\u201d\n\nFarid has applied a few times to be legally resettled in Europe, without luck so far. He is struggling but surviving.\n\n\u201cWe just get by doing random jobs,\u201d he says. It could be worse, he adds. He could have drowned at sea, or be looking over his shoulder in Lebanon. He could have been deported to Syria.\n\nHassan, Syria\n\nHassan was the last of the brothers to leave. Once Dara\u2019a fell to the regime last year, there was only enough money to smuggle one brother to Lebanon. Rami went. By the time his brothers in Europe finally saved enough for Hassan, it was April this year, and he crossed into Lebanon, where patience for people like him had run out.\n\nBut he still had friends in the city. One of them let him work in his furniture store a few days a week. He could keep a small commission from whatever he sold.\n\nHassan had been in Lebanon less than three months when security officials arrived at the shop, asking staff to show their IDs. \u201cIt was like someone had told on him,\u201d says Rami. \u201cThe authorities came to the shop looking especially for him.\u201d\n\nKareem was the first to learn of his brother\u2019s imprisonment. A contact arranged to courier $5,000 to a corrupt official for information about where Hassan was being kept. The official charged another $20,000 to release him.\n\nNow, when the brothers reach Hassan by phone, he is evasive. He doesn\u2019t say where he sleeps. He is vague about what happened in jail.\n\n\u201cHe just says: \u2018Whatever you think prison is \u2013 exactly as you imagine it \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u201d says Kareem.\n\nFrom his room in Beirut, over the din of children\u2019s television and traffic outside, Rami says his brother in Syria keeps giving the same warning. \u201cHe just tells me: hide yourself,\u201d Rami says. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get you.\u201d", "description": "The brothers haven\u2019t seen each other since 2012.
