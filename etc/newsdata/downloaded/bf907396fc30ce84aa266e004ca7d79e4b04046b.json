They have worked and played well. And this is the reward.\u201d\n\nThe defending champion took a one-point lead over Real Madrid before it visits Mallorca later on Saturday.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid continued to miss the goals that Griezmann took with him when he left last offseason for Camp Nou.\n\nDiego Simeone\u2019s side conceded a late equalizer in a 1-1 draw with Valencia after Atl\u00e9tico went down to 10 men when forward Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix injured his right ankle with all three substitutions made.\n\nBIG THREE\n\nBarcelona played its best away match of the campaign, easily breaking Eibar\u2019s attempt to pressure.\n\nGriezmann got Barcelona going in the 13th minute when Clement Lenglet met his run behind Eibar\u2019s high defensive line with a long ball that left him alone to beat goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.\n\nDmitrovic denied Messi before halftime, but couldn\u2019t turn back his shot in the 58th after a slick passing combination by Su\u00e1rez and Griezmann set up Barcelona\u2019s all-time scorer in the area.\n\nThe three linked up again in the 66th when Griezmann launched Messi with a through ball. Messi then slid the ball over for Su\u00e1rez to finish off on the break.\n\nValverde\u2019s team has won five matches across all competitions after an erratic start to the season.\n\nBarcelona plays at Slavia Prague in the Champions League group phase on Wednesday.\n\nPAREJO FREE KICK\n\nAtl\u00e9tico was in control when Diego Costa converted a first-half penalty after Denis Cheryshev used his hand to block a ball on the edge of the area. The referee consulted the video review to make the ruling.\n\nCheryshev hit the crossbar in Valencia\u2019s best chance to level from open play. But two minutes after F\u00e9lix limped off to leave Atl\u00e9tico a man down, Parejo bent a free kick over the defensive barrier and beat goalkeeper Jan Oblak with eight minutes remaining.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico is in fourth place behind the surprising Granada in third. It has scored just three goals and earned one win in six rounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antoine Griezmann has started clicking in Barcelona's attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/spain_soccer_la_liga_30352_c0-173-4144-2590_s1200x700.jpg?e5188468c899f97048d4cd2797ece7c5da63747c", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
