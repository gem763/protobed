Sign up here.\n\nGermany\u2019s private sector is suffering its worst downturn in almost seven years as a manufacturing slump deepens, raising pressure on the government to add fiscal stimulus.\n\nA Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index fell to 49.1 in September from 51.7 a month earlier, according to IHS Markit. The reading was worse than economists predicted and the lowest since October 2012. It\u2019s also the first reading below 50, signaling contraction, since April 2013.\n\nThe confluence of trade tensions, challenges for the auto industry and looming Brexit are \u201cparalyzing order books\u201d in manufacturing, said Phil Smith, an economist at Markit. The result is the worst slump German industry has seen since the depth of 2009 financial crisis, he reckons.\n\n\u201cThe manufacturing numbers are simply awful,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe economy is limping toward the final quarter of the year and, on its current trajectory, might not see any growth before the end of 2019.\u201d\n\nThere are already signs that the export-driven manufacturing slump is spreading into the rest of the economy. Job growth is stalling after almost six years of practically uninterrupted growth.\n\nServices saw the first decline in new business in more than four and a half years in September, which provides \u201cevidence that demand across Germany is already starting to deteriorate,\u201d according to Smith.\n\nWhile the European Central Bank decided earlier this month to roll out a new stimulus package for the euro zone, the German government has so far been reluctant to heed calls to add its own fiscal support.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel promised to stick to a policy of zero deficit spending on Friday, even as her administration announced a 54 billion-euro ($60 billion) pledge to put its climate target back on track.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
