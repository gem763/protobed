(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nSleep is one of those things that\u2019s necessary for absolutely everybody, while also being pretty hard to understand to understand or find for some.\n\nInsomnia is an ever-present spectre for some, while conditions like sleep paralysis, sleep apnea, severe snoring, or night terrors pervade the lives of others.\n\nGiven that sleep can affect everything from your weight, to your concentration, to whether or not you get heart disease or have a stroke, it\u2019s no surprise we\u2019re all looking for ways to sleep longer and better.\n\nThe first step in that is understanding the importance of sleep, and what an optimum night\u2019s shut-eye entails. Here are all your main questions answered.\n\nHow much sleep do we need?\n\nYou may have heard the old saying that eight hours a night is ideal. While that\u2019s good guide timing, there isn\u2019t an exact right amount that suits everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe amount of sleep you need varies with your age and life circumstances.\n\nSleep expert Neil Stanley says: \u2018Individual sleep need is like height \u2013 we are all different and it is to a large degree genetically determined. Anywhere between about four and eleven hours can be considered normal but getting just one hour less sleep a night than you require can have measurable effects on your physical and mental health.\u2019\n\nThe Sleep Foundation recommend about seven to nine hours a night for an adult or young adult, but this can be affected by anything from how stressful your days are, your health, and the stimulants you eat or drink throughout the day.\n\nAs you get older, you also start to need less sleep.\n\nStanley advises that you work out what\u2019s best for you. If you feel tired every day that means you aren\u2019t getting enough hours.\n\nHow the sleep cycle works\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the amount of sleep you\u2019re having either, but the amount of quality sleep and sleep cycles.\n\nSleep researchers generally divide sleep up into five stages.\n\nStages one and two are \u2018light sleep\u2019, stages three and four are \u2018deep sleep\u2019, while stage five is REM.\n\nLight sleep occurs when you first nod off. It usually involves lots of movement, and is easy to wake from.\n\nWhen your body is finally comfortable you will fall into deep sleep. Your brain switches off and your body does a bit of maintenance.\n\nThis includes secreting a growth hormone to repair damaged cells, cleaning your blood with your kidneys, and strengthening your immune system.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that bed just make you want to snuggle up?

This will only tend to happen if there are real concerns about your wellbeing and sleep quality.\n\nSome fitness trackers can also give you rough estimates of your sleep quality, but much of this tech is fairly new so shouldn\u2019t be relied on exclusively.\n\nWhy is REM sleep important?\n\nAs touched on earlier, this is the point during your sleep cycle where the most goes on in terms of restoration and rejuvenation of your body.\n\nSome of the benefits of REM sleep include:\n\ncell regeneration\n\nincreasing blood supply to muscles\n\npromoting growth and repair of tissues and bones\n\nstrengthening the immune system\n\nhelping your memories be processed and stored in your brain\n\nThese processes happening are the difference between waking up after a full night feeling refreshed, or feeling groggy and tired in the morning.\n\nWhat happens when you experience sleep deprivation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it would undoubtedly be easier if we could get everything done night and day, with no need for sleep.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case, however, and the effects of sleep deprivation can actually be devastating.\n\nAlongside the fact that you won\u2019t get the benefits of sleep mentioned above, sleep deprivation can cause various things depending on how long you\u2019re awake.\n\nTo start off with, you\u2019ll likely feel irritable and tired, with effects like severe drowsiness and inability to focus growing over the course of days. At this point, you\u2019re much more at risk of accidents when driving, working, or even doing simple daily tasks.\n\nOver time, lack of sleep can lead to obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, as levels of hormones dip or rise and cause changes in your body.\n\nHow to get to sleep\n\nThis may be the trickiest one of all, as different people find that different methods work for them. The first thing to do, though, is ensure you have the right conditions for sleep.\n\nSleeping in a dark, quiet room with as few distractions as possible is best. Consider your body temperature, too, as being too hot or cold can hinder sleep.\n\nThen consider your bedroom routine, being careful to avoid blue light from phones and other devices before bed. Some recommend a warm bath an hour or so before bed too.\n\nAs well as this, keeping regular bed times and wake up times and avoiding caffeine should help regulate when you get tired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf none of these things are working, you can try the many sleep apps available online designed to lull you into slumber. From there, if you still can\u2019t drop off, you should see your GP.\n\nWe don\u2019t recommend sleeping at your desk. (Picture: Ella Byworth)\n\nWhich sleep position is best?\n\nThe most common sleep position is the foetal position, with 41% of adults drifting off this way. Strictly there\u2019s no \u2018best\u2019 sleeping position, but rather ones that work best for different people.\n\nSleeping on your back reduces pressure on your muscles and joints, and can also reduce acid reflux. This is considered the ideal position as long as you don\u2019t have sleep apnoea or snoring issues (as your tongue could block your airways and make things worse).\n\nIf you do have either of these issues, sleeping on your side with your legs and arms relatively straight is ideal.\n\nPregnant women are recommended to sleep in the foetal position to increase blood flow and stops your uterus pressing on your liver. Just make sure not to ball yourself too tightly.\n\nFor all of you who sleep on your front, you may be sad to know that there aren\u2019t many benefits of this. Still, if you must, it\u2019s advised that you sleep with your forehead against a soft pillow and facing forward, so you have room to breathe but also don\u2019t have to crane your neck.\n\nWhat is sleep paralysis?\n\nSleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or speak that happens when you\u2019re waking up or, less commonly, falling asleep, according to the NHS.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially when your body is in REM sleep while still awake, and is often seen in people who have been deprived of sleep, who have irregular sleeping patterns, or who have a condition called narcolepsy.\n\nAlthough you\u2019re awake, your body is briefly paralysed, after which you can move and speak as normal. Hallucinations during sleep paralysis are also common. This can last from a few seconds to several minutes.\n\nSleep paralysis doesn\u2019t cause you any harm, but being unable to move can be very frightening. Some people have sleep paralysis once or twice in their life, while others experience it a few times a month or more regularly.\n\nIt can affect people of all ages, but it\u2019s more common in teenagers and young adults. Men and women are equally affected.\n\nWhat is sleep apnoea?\n\nOn a base level, this condition involves breathing stopping and starting while you\u2019re asleep.\n\nmaking gasping, snorting or choking noises\n\nrepeated waking\n\nloud snoring\n\nDuring the day, you may also experience:\n\ntiredness\n\nlack of concentration\n\nmood swings\n\na headache when you wake up\n\nIf you suspect you have sleep apnoea, the best thing to do is visit your GP. You\u2019ll likely be referred to a sleep clinic, and treatments if you are diagnosed include a CPAP machine to improve breathing, or a gum shield to ensure your mouth is open.\n\nMORE: Where to get the best eggs in London\n\nMORE: This male model\u2019s ferocious strut at Paris Fashion Week is going viral\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "From the definition of deep sleep, to the ideal amount you can get each night, we answer all your sleep questions.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sleepy-24ed_1570810058.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
