So it\u2019s clearly a risk to draw conclusions about what exactly happened. But a consensus did seem to emerge in the past two weeks of the campaign that the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the NDP had done better than expected. If the vote hasn\u2019t borne that out, please disregard the following. Or maybe put it in your processing mill with all the other grist that turned out to be unfounded as we all try to figure out what did happen.\n\nThe two parties did better than expected because their two leaders did better than expected. In the case of Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, most people had no expectations of him, no one who doesn\u2019t follow Quebec politics having heard of him. As for Jagmeet Singh, expectations were low on the basis of observed behaviour: his not being very present, very briefed or, seemingly, very quick on his toes. But, in part because expectations were so low, both leaders were pleasant surprises. That\u2019s according to many commentators but also according to the 12 per cent of Quebec voters and five per cent of Canada-wide voters who, the polls said, moved to the Bloc and NDP, respectively, during the campaign.\n\nHow did they surprise? Mainly in the debates and mainly by behaving more or less like normal people. They aren\u2019t normal people, of course. They are politicians and party leaders, albeit of smaller parties, and are used to living their lives in public. But they came across as recognizable human beings, rather than the automatons Justin Trudeau and Andrew Scheer tried so hard to imitate at various stages during the campaign.\n\nThey were even mildly amusing at times. When Lisa Laflamme asked him how \u201cas prime minister\u201d he would do this or that, Blanchet said \u201cprime minister is a bit unlikely but \u2026\u201d He joked about how many seconds it would be before Maxime Bernier interrupted him (it was 10) and when he himself was accused of interrupting he said \u201cPlease go ahead. We\u2019re still nice people.\u201d As for Singh, when Trudeau kept calling him \u201cMr. Scheer\u201d he made a joke of it: \u201cI don\u2019t know how people are getting me mixed up.\u201d The word \u201claughter\u201d appears in the Maclean\u2019s transcript of the English debate 19 times (believe it or not). Five times it\u2019s associated with Blanchet and five times with Singh. The other four leaders got one association each with the moderators accounting for the rest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident the candidates most associated with \u201claughter\u201d did best.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s a lot easier to be relaxed and natural when you have, as Blanchet conceded explicitly, no chance of becoming prime minister. It also makes it much easier to promise people whatever they ask for. But it shouldn\u2019t be beyond the ability of leaders who do have a chance to win to behave a little less like zombies. In his roughly 20 minutes of debate time Trudeau mentioned no fewer than five times how his government had raised 900,000 Canadians up out of poverty. Outside the classroom \u2014 or the tavern \u2014 does anyone repeat the same fact five times in 20 minutes?\n\nAs for Scheer, to my mind he lost the election when early in the debate he turned to Trudeau and accused him of being a phoney and a fraud. Going in, Scheer\u2019s best selling point was that he seems a decent, reasonable, unassuming guy \u2014 a very Canadian guy, in those respects \u2014 who could do a competent job governing the country, albeit without the pizzazz, preening and posturing of the past four years. (If in fact Scheer won the election, I\u2019d argue it was in spite of that intervention, not because of it.) But his obviously rehearsed attack mainly reminded people of question period. If you want to turn Canadians off, behave as if you\u2019re in question period.\n\n\u201cPhoney\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d are such Trump-like words. Did Scheer learn nothing about parliamentary language in four years as Speaker? Trudeau is a disappointment and in many ways hypocritical but it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s actually a misogynist just pretending to be a feminist. Sure, he doesn\u2019t live up to the high standards he would impose on everyone else. In our species, that\u2019s not a rare trait. In any case, substance aside, Scheer\u2019s \u201cphoney and fraud\u201d denunciation seemed completely canned.\n\nMulroney cabinet minister John Crosbie used to say sincerity is the most important thing in politics and once you can fake that you\u2019ve got it made. If the parties do learn from this campaign that what the people want is politicians who are more natural, you can bet politicians will start rehearsing their naturalness.\n\nIf we do want people rather than automatons running for office, we might start by reforming question period. No more notes or \u201cQP cards\u201d would be my rule. Either people speak without such aids or they don\u2019t speak. Have a look at last Saturday\u2019s Brexit debate at parliamentlive.tv/Commons. By the Speaker\u2019s own count, Boris Johnson took no fewer than 55 questions from members. The overwhelming majority he actually answered \u2014 in the sense of addressing the question that was asked, if not always to the questioner\u2019s satisfaction.\n\nSo far as we can, we should ban canned.", "description": "Blanchet and Singh came across as recognizable human beings, rather than the automatons Justin Trudeau and Andrew Scheer tried so hard to imitate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/votes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
