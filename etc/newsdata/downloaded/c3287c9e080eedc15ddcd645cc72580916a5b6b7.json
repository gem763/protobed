Here\u2019s how it stacks up against the competition.]\n\nThe chicken chain on Thursday tweeted a video in which impatient people attempt to DIY a version of the sandwich using the three-piece tenders and random buns, including what looks like one meant for a hot dog. Things, predictably, don\u2019t go well.\n\nTry our new BYOB! It\u2019s basically The Sandwich! Only no mayo. Or pickles.

What, a multimillion-dollar corporation capitalizing on a viral sensation? We\u2019re shocked. Shocked!\n\nPopeyes: you can bring your own bun now Chick Fil A: pic.twitter.com/BX7drmHQvw \u2014 B.J.
