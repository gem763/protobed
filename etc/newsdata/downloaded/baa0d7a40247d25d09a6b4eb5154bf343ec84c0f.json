There were ancient tapestries, intricately carved wood paneling and Victorian architectural quirks, such as a primitive lavatory from the time, The Times of London reported when the home was last listed in 2007.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, a stockpile of nearly 400 valuable antiques and Oriental carpets from the estate were auctioned by Sotheby\u2019s in London to the tune of \u00a32.24 million.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Cannons were busy bringing the ramshackle mansion, which reportedly lacked everything from basic heating to a functional roof, into the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe owners have spent years sympathetically restoring the house and improving the internal rooms and configuration,\u201d according to the listing agency. Those include opening up a new entrance to the home\u2019s interior courtyard for better flow and enlarging the family kitchen and dining area, which adjoin a preserved \u201cmuseum kitchen.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a new bar, a home cinema and a master suite with two attached dressing rooms and an en-suite bathroom. Outside, the sellers built two large showroom garages with space for 12 vehicles, according to Knight Frank.\n\n\n\nStill, images show the Grade I-listed building has retained many period finishes, including its voluminous, oak-paneled living rooms on the ground level that include ornate stone fireplaces and detailed ceiling plasterwork.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Yves Klein\u2019s \u2018Barbara (ANT) 113\u2019 Could Fetch $12M-$18M\n\nNumerous outbuildings, including the stable block, coach house and various store houses, allowed the owners to embark on a parallel project as they restored Newton House: a small-batch gin distillery using herbs and botanicals from restored gardens and natural spring water running through the estate.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the owners converted the stables and coach house, into a venue called The Bespoke Gin House, where they host regular gin and jazz evenings, according to their website. The owners could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nThe distillery is also available for sale by separate negotiation, according to the agency.", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-119221?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
