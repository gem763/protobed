Why sit by yourself and ruminate when there are analytics available, proven drills to solve whatever ails you on the basketball court? Why empty your mind when there\u2019s always another opponent to scout?\n\n\u201c \u2018Eh, that\u2019s weird,\u2019 \u201d Delle Donne said, flip as could be, describing her attitude toward the mental exercises the Mystics\u2019 sports psychologist introduced when she first got to Washington. \u201c \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like me, I don\u2019t do yoga, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be into it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, if it could help her basketball, Delle Donne will try anything once. She\u2019s unusually open-minded for an established superstar, her teammates say, so she gave regular meditation an earnest shot starting in the middle of the 2018 season, and eventually, she felt calmer. Then she started feeling more in control on the basketball court. Then she became a devotee, practicing 10 minutes a day, as if she was staying after practice to swish a few free throws.\n\nOf the myriad tiny tweaks Delle Donne makes to continue pushing her game forward in her seventh year in the league, it turns out that tending to the mental side of the game paid the biggest dividends.\n\nThis season, Delle Donne is averaging 19.5 points \u2014 second in the league, but well below her career high of 23.4 in 2015, when she won her first MVP award with the Chicago Sky \u2014 and 8.3 rebounds. But it was how she scored, not necessarily how much, that impressed. At 30 years old, she became the first WNBA player to sustain at least 50 percent shooting from the field (51.5 percent), 40 percent shooting on three-pointers (43 percent) and 90 percent on free throws (97.4 percent) for an entire regular season. This summer, she became the second-fastest player to reach 3,500 career points following Diana Taurasi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore important, she led the Mystics to the best regular season in franchise history and the top seed in the WNBA playoffs. They hold a 1-0 lead in their best-of-five- semifinal series against the Las Vegas Aces heading into Thursday night\u2019s game in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the biggest difference this year, my commitment to meditation and mindfulness,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve just been so much more aware of my emotions and my thoughts. I\u2019ve been able to refocus, re-center, change the story.\u201d\n\n\u2018Insane numbers\u2019: NBA stars welcome Elena Delle Donne to 50-40-90 club\n\nYear-round focus\n\nDelle Donne\u2019s commitment to improvement, however, was neither strictly focused on the mental game nor new to Delle Donne.\n\nIn the first serious conversation Delle Donne had with the Mystics after she told the Chicago Sky she wanted a trade following the 2016 season, she grilled Washington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault for 30 minutes about the tools his franchise had to help Delle Donne get better. Never mind that she was already a three-time WNBA all-star game starter, a former MVP and an Olympic gold medalist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe asked us questions about all the periphery stuff, about sports psychology and weightlifting and facilities, what the coaching staff was like, individual work in the offseason,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cI think I was really honest with her about what I thought she could get better at and how we could use her in different ways, we could expand the skills she had. We told her we thought she could get a lot better as a defender. If she wanted to be the best player in the game, she had an upside in a lot of different things.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne is the rare player who doesn\u2019t play overseas during the WNBA offseason, in large part to stay close to her family home in Delaware and her older sister Lizzie, who was born blind and deaf, with autism and cerebral palsy and communicates only through touch and scent.\n\nWhen her Mystics teammates head abroad to supplement their incomes, Delle Donne takes advantage of all Washington has to offer. She starts every offseason by sitting down with Mike Thibault and his son Eric, the Mystics\u2019 associate head coach, to plot ways to get better.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImproving Delle Donne\u2019s defense has been a task that\u2019s spanned multiple offseasons. This year, while rehabbing a bone bruise in her left knee, the 6-foot-4 guard-forward spent all winter watching hours of film with Eric Thibault to develop better defensive timing when guarding smaller players. Two years ago, the focus was more targeted: Delle Donne slouches naturally, so she put in hours in the weight room working on her posture.\n\n\u201cTo play good defense, you don\u2019t want to be leaning forward all the time,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nAside from her mental strength, Delle Donne believes that her defense has probably improved more than any other skill since she joined Washington. This season, she has been put to work defending shooting guards and centers alike. Her 8.3 rebounds per game nearly matches her career-best of 8.4 during her previous MVP season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s that talented, she came in the league that talented,\u201d Las Vegas Aces Coach Bill Laimbeer said when asked about Delle Donne\u2019s MVP award. \u201cOkay, she\u2019s been that kind of player her whole life, so what changed? She had to learn a little bit more about the WNBA and how big and physical they are, she\u2019s learned to be a better post player than she was in the past. You used to just switch on her and that was the end of it.\u201d\n\n'I'm so much more calm'\n\nDelle Donne was always willing to do the on-court work required to get better, but minding her brain came less naturally.\n\nStu Singer, the Mystics\u2019 sports psychologist the past five years, leads the team in regular \u201cmind-set workouts\u201d \u2014 a term that describes mental exercises designed to help players deal with stress and teach them how to change poor habits. Delle Donne had always found the sessions helpful but wasn\u2019t a believer until the middle of last season, when she dedicated herself to daily meditation and working with Singer more intensely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe wasn\u2019t trying to fix a problem; she was simply curious about the benefits of trying something new.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of those people that\u2019s driven to be great, and when you\u2019re driven to be great, you keep working on things,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nSinger helped Delle Donne learn how to make in-game mental adjustments.\n\n\u201cThe overthinking is that voice of perfection, that voice of, \u2018I didn\u2019t do it right,\u2019 and then we get stuck in replaying what just happened if it wasn\u2019t good, or we get stuck in predicting, \u2018Oh, I missed my first few shots, that means I\u2019m not going to make anymore tonight,\u2019\u201d Singer said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in those spaces, that\u2019s where anxiety lives. So what we\u2019re trying to teach is staying present \u2014 how do you miss a shot, how do you have a bad foul call on you and regroup, become highly aware of where your emotions and thoughts are right now, and if those aren\u2019t helping you, how do you re-adjust? \u2026 The impact that it has is, in the middle of the game, she can recalibrate in different moments.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDelle Donne has incorporated the basic principles of meditation in that she focuses on her breath to collect herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so much more calm. I don\u2019t let the moment get away from me or something be too big or something bother me for too long,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI was good at hiding it. I\u2019m never one to vocalize things or try to show anybody my emotions, that\u2019s always been something, like, nobody should see how I\u2019m feeling. Especially the opponent, I don\u2019t want them to know if they were getting at me, but mentally, sometimes they were. Now, I truly \u2014 you\u2019re going to have moments where there are ups and downs, but I can really stay present. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n\nHaving better mastery of her emotions has also helped Delle Donne\u2019s leadership with the Mystics. Every player on the team has mentioned throughout the season how the MVP has become more vocal, although that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s screaming in practice. Delle Donne does occasionally raise her voice in the huddle \u2014 and when she does, her teammates know to listen \u2014 but often, she takes a player aside to dole out a pointer or two in private.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPart of her more noticeable leadership is that she\u2019s simply more comfortable with this close-knit Mystics group than she was when she first entered the locker room in 2017. For her 30th birthday party, she invited the entire team for a boat party, Thibault included. She\u2019s close with Tianna Hawkins\u2019s young son. Reserve guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough calls her (and Kristi Toliver) \u201cmy daughters.\u201d\n\nFor Delle Donne, a second MVP trophy isn\u2019t just a reward for the work she constantly does to keep improving, it\u2019s meaningful because she won it with a team she loves and a franchise that wanted to help her evolve.\n\n\u201cThis is my family; I love it here,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI feel like this [MVP award] would mean even more, because it\u2019s been different. It\u2019s not just scoring a ton of points, I\u2019ve been able to make others better and impact the game in different ways, I feel like I\u2019ve become such a smarter player. And that\u2019s because of being with Coach [Thibault] for three years and learning so much from him, and being on a team that\u2019s so selfless and truly loves each other and has loved this process.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nBarry Svrluga: With a place to call home, these WNBA playoffs could be different for the Mystics\n\nThe Mystics are an anomaly in the WNBA: A juggernaut patiently built on character and chemistry\n\nCourtney Williams is the heart of the Connecticut Sun\u2019s WNBA title quest", "description": "The Mystics star is the WNBA MVP for the second time in her career after she embraced meditation as another way to improve her game.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Z1Wa5rYWH-P1f9vcKp_EEMtxdwA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YS2TRIGRBYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
