So, he adjusted his delivery and it helped him get his 14th win.\n\nCody Bellinger hit his 47th homer, Buehler pitched five solid innings, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Francisco Giants 9-2 on Friday night.\n\nBellinger\u2019s leadoff homer in the second off Johnny Cueto (1-2) started a five-run inning in which the Dodgers sent nine men to the plate.\n\nCorey Seager and Joc Pederson also went deep, and Gavin Lux added an RBI triple in the second as Dodgers won their fifth straight.\n\nBuehler (14-4), who Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said will be among the team\u2019s first three starters in the playoffs, started his delivery with his hands more in front of him instead of overhead, intended to speed up his delivery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a panic thing,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cThis is what I do. I tinker and I think when I give myself a little something new to think about sometimes it simplifies everything for me.\u201d\n\nBuehler gave up two runs on five hits, striking out eight and walking two.\n\n\u201cIn the zone, when it was there it was really good, but I think it just kind of didn\u2019t allow for efficiency,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cFor him to get through five tonight was a good thing because after that fourth inning he really labored.\u201d\n\nPederson\u2019s homer was his 36th and fourth in five games.\n\nCueto allowed five runs on five hits, including three home runs in two innings in his fourth - and shortest - start since coming back on Sept. 10 from a 13-month absence while recovering Tommy John surgery.\n\n\u201cThis is a long process,\u201d Cueto said through a translator. \u201cBasically, what I wanted to do was to see how I felt. I wasn\u2019t too concerned about the results. I think I feel great. I had two good and two bad outings. But hopefully moving forward next year, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nMADBUM START NIXED\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy said ace Madison Bumgarner was scratched from Sunday\u2019s start and will not pitch the last game before he retires.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to feel like he had to get out there,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThe game\u2019s not going to determine anything. I just assume he would help manage from the bench.\u201d\n\nROBERTS\u2018 BOCHY TAKE\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy\u2019s retirement - which goes into effect on the last day of the regular season on Sunday - won\u2019t last long, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts predicts.\n\nRoberts, who played the last four years of his career under Bochy (two in San Diego and two in San Francisco), cited the three-time World Series champion manager\u2019s evolution on changes in the game he didn\u2019t immediately embrace to be a key factor.\n\n\u201cTo now be introduced to a new way of doing things with a lot of younger players who are very exciting to watch and coach, I think that intrigues him,\u201d Roberts said.\n\n\u201cThere might have been some resistance early, but I think that there\u2019s a lot more openness. . I\u2019ve seen that in the way he manages, and (from) conversations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWILLIE MAC\u201d AWARD\n\nGiants center fielder Kevin Pillar was named this year\u2019s \u201cWillie Mac\u201d award winner in a pregame ceremony. The award, named after Hall of Famer Willie McCovey, has been presented annually to the team\u2019s most inspirational player since 1980. Pillar is the first player to receive the award since McCovey\u2019s death on Oct. 31. The award is voted on by Giants players, coaches, trainers, clubhouse staff and fans.\n\nSHORT HOPS\n\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr was among those in attendance for Friday\u2019s game. \u2026 Giants rookie Mike Yastrzemski collected his 100th hit. . Lux made a leaping catch to rob Giants pinch-hitter Jaylin Davis of a hit with two outs and two on in the eighth. \u2026 The Giants were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 17, matching a San Francisco-era record for a nine-inning game. . Bochy managed his 4,030 game, matching Sparky Anderson for seventh all time.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDodgers: 3B Justin Turner (back tightness) was out of the lineup a third straight day. Depending on how he feels after taking batting practice on Friday, Roberts said he hopes to have Turner back in the lineup on Saturday, \u201cbut if not, then he\u2019ll be in there on Sunday.\u201d . RHP Joe Kelly (unspecified injury), who hasn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 18, threw a bullpen session on Friday. He\u2019s expected to make an appearance on Sunday. . LF A.J. Pollock left the game in the fifth inning with a left knee contusion.\n\nGiants: C Buster Posey was out of the starting lineup for a third straight day after catching into the 13th inning of Tuesday\u2019s 16-inning game against Colorado. Posey will start on Saturday, Bochy said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Hyun-Jun Ryu (13-5, 2.41 ERA) is 6-6 with a 2.79 ERA in 17 career starts against the Giants. He\u2019ll pitch opposite rookie RHP Logan Webb (2-2, 5.61).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Walker Buehler had been disappointed in his last two starts.
