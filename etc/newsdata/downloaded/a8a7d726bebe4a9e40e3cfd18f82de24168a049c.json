When it opens in a few years\u2014it's set to break ground in 2020\u2014in Jackson Park on the city's South Side, the Presidential Center will be home to a museum, a public gathering space, a new branch of the Chicago Public Library, an athletic center, and a large plaza. Designed by New York\u2013based architectural firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien, the latest iteration of the project further refines last year\u2019s changes to the central museum building, which had been criticized by some as severe and foreboding.\n\nImage courtesy of The Obama Foundation. More\n\nIn this iteration, the building \"embodies the idea of ascension,\" and is \"inspired by the idea of four hands coming together; a recognition that many hands shape a place,\" according to the Obama Foundation website. This version of the design also features an 88-foot tall glass cutout that invites one to gaze into the building from the outside, which will \u201cemit a soft, welcoming glow.\u201d\n\nImage courtesy of The Obama Foundation. More\n\nSome of the finer details of the museum\u2019s design are also starting to come into focus. The tower\u2019s southwest corner will \u201clikely display a quotation from an Obama speech that stressed the theme of unity,\u201d Williams and Tsien told the Chicago Tribune. They\u2019ve also homed in on American granite for the fa\u00e7ade, which will help to lighten the structure and introduce visual patterns that are more dynamic that than other materials would offer.\n\nIn addition to a new museum building, the new renderings also reveal the center's on-site environmental stewardship. There will be a one-acre Wetland Walk, which will capture and treat stormwater while creating a winding path through the park\u2019s environment. The project will also restore and update Jackson Park\u2019s existing Women\u2019s Garden, which encircles the sunken lawn.\n\nImage courtesy of The Obama Foundation. More\n\nGiven the 19.3-acre complex\u2019s location within a historic park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the Obama Foundation has turned to the local community to make sure they get it right. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the past few years talking with the community and meeting with neighbors and stakeholders to incorporate their input,\" Obama Foundation CEO David Simas said in a press release. \u201cIn response to the feedback we received, we\u2019re presenting updates that create even more ways for the community to enjoy what will become an important and memorable gathering place.\u201d\n\nOriginally Appeared on Architectural Digest\n\n", "description": "Tod Williams and Billie Tsien respond to previous criticism of the project with their latest designs", "authors": ["Tim Nelson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x4c6Pm81HsoXFwBRlUgcJg--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/architectural_digest_422/5eee891f59c1c2ca433c8d3faeb140ca", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
