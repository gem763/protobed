AAP Image/Steven Saphore/via REUTERS\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t light it, but we\u2019re trying to fight it,\u201d read one sign carried by a student in Sydney, as social media posts showed huge demonstrations around the country, including outback towns like Alice Springs.\n\n\u201cThe oceans are rising and so are we,\u201d read another sign held by a protester wearing school uniform in Melbourne.\n\nProtests inspired by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg are planned in about 150 countries on Friday as people rally to demand governments take immediate action to limit the harmful effects of manmade climate change.\n\nThe strike will culminate in New York when Thunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her climate activism, will spearhead a rally at the United Nations headquarters.\n\nThunberg noted the \u201chuge crowd\u201d in Sydney in a tweet, which she said would set the standard as the strikes moved across Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\nBy early afternoon, the Sydney protesters were overflowing out of a 34-hectare (84-acre) open space in the city. Similar crowds were reported in Brisbane and other state capitals.\n\nDanielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student, had a blunt message for politicians like Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who told parliament on Thursday that students should stay in class.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work,\u201d she said, wearing anti-coal earrings. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.\u201d\n\nRISING SEAS\n\nThe U.N. summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.\n\nThe issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.\n\nChildren in the Solomon Islands rallied on the shoreline wearing traditional grass skirts and carrying wooden shields in solidarity with the global movement.\n\nIn Thailand, more than 200 young people stormed into the Environment Ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death as they demanded government action on climate change.\n\n\u201cThis is what will happen if we don\u2019t stop climate change now,\u201d said 21-year-old strike organiser Nanticha Ocharoenchai.\n\nThe Thai Environment Ministry\u2019s deputy permanent secretary, Adisorn Noochdumrong, supported the students.\n\n\u201cThis is how the young people express their concerns, which we deem as a good sign and not at all a nuisance,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Palangka Raya, in Indonesia\u2019s Central Kalimantan province, youths carrying placards marched through heavy smog caused by forest fires.\n\nIn the eastern Indian city of Kolkata around 25 school children handed out flyers at busy bus terminals and held placards that read \u201cSave Our Planet. Save Our World\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the only planet we have. We wanted to stand for it before we went to school for the day,\u201d one of the children said.\n\nNo protests were authorised in China, the world\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another.\n\n\u201cChinese youth have their own methods,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.\n\nCarbon emissions climbed to a record high last year, despite a warning from the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilise the climate.\n\nOrganisers said demonstrations would take different forms around the world, but all aim to promote awareness of climate change and demand political action to curb contributing factors.", "description": "Thousands of students took to the streets of Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries on Friday to kick off a global strike demanding world leaders gathering for a U.N. climate summit adopt urgent measures to stop an environmental catastrophe.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431844041&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J081", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
