More than 640 inhabitants were summoned to the village square. The men were machine-gunned in a nearby barn, the women and children were locked in the local church, before being burned to death inside. The sort of murderous spree that the Germans committed here may have been routine on the Eastern Front, but it broke with the comparatively civilized conventions so far followed in the West. The troops' commander, SS Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Adolf Diekmann, was to have been disciplined, but was killed in action not long after. After the war, it was decided to leave the violated village as a monument to all those lost in France's resistance against the occupation\n\nOld Steam Mill, Volgograd (Stalingrad), Russia\n\nBuilt in 1903, the Old Steam Mill was the only building in Stalingrad to survive the fighting. In the foreground, the statue is a recent replica, but this same group of children was dancing around this same crocodile in the centre of the city when the German assault began in September 1942. A scene from a fairytale fantasy by poet Korney Chukovsky, the sculpture came to emblematize the eternal endurance of innocence and hope\n\nGun emplacement, Longues-sur-Mer, Normandy, France\n\nThe Germans built this battery on the Calvados coast as part of their 'Atlantic Wall' \u2013 and, when D-Day came, it did its job. Sited between the Allied landing beaches of Gold and Omaha, it withstood constant air and artillery bombardment while raining munitions down on the landing forces\n\nMaunsell Fort, Thames Estuary\n\nNamed after Guy Maunsell of the Royal Engineers, forts like this were to play a vital role in offering anti-aircraft cover for merchant vessels in those vulnerable hours as they approached port. Similar installations in the narrower mouth of the Mersey, outside Liverpool, proved a hazard to post-war shipping and were removed\n\nCauseway to Cramond Island, Edinburgh\n\nTo the west of Edinburgh\u2019s port of Leith, Cramond Island remained strategically important in commanding the approaches to the Forth Bridge and the Royal Dockyard at Rosyth. Gun emplacements on the island were reached at low tide by this causeway and submarines kept out by the boom of pylons to the right\n\nBunker, Huertgen Forest, Eifel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\n\nThis bunker, hidden by thick forest, would have felt a lot less hospitable with the descent of winter. In the event, the advancing Americans reached this point in September 1944: not until that December did they succeed in pushing through\n\nJapanese midget tank, Lelu Harbour, Kosrae Island, Micronesia\n\nThough the Japanese forces who occupied Kosrae threw up fortifications and dug a network of tunnels, the Allied enemy never actually landed here. That didn\u2019t mean the island didn\u2019t see action: air raids were frequent \u2013 and could be destructive, as this tank\u2019s crew were to discover\n\nLockheed Ventura, Kimbe, West New Britain, Papua New Guinea\n\nThe jungle steadily reclaims a Lockheed Ventura of the New Zealand Air Force. This aircraft crashed at Talasea Airfield when it suffered from engine failure in September 1944, following a bombing mission against Japanese shipping in Rabaul Harbour, New Britain\n\nObservation Tower, Rehoboth Beach, Cape Henlopen State Park, Delaware\n\nStanding on Rehoboth Beach, this is one of a number of observation towers built by the US military at the entrance to Delaware Bay. The nearby Fort Miles was completed in 1941 to protect the bay and was home to coastal batteries manned by more than 2,000 military personnel. The observation towers provided early warning for any potential Axis maritime activity\n\nLookout Tower, Malin Head, Republic of Ireland\n\nIrish neutrality during the war didn\u2019t bring automatic peace and quiet. Here on Ireland\u2019s northerly headland, Britain was secretly allowed to install surveillance equipment for its defence\n\nFlak Tower G, Vienna, Austria (left) and Observation Post, Loch Ewe, Scottish Highlands (right)\n\nSo enamoured were the Germans with the idea of the flak tower that they built three in Vienna; a further three in Berlin; a couple in Hamburg and others in Frankfurt and Stuttgart. The evidence suggests, however, that they\u2019re more impressive as monuments than they ever were as protection against air raids. Pictured left is a tower in Vienna. Meanwhile, too remote for even an anxious War Office seriously to regard as a potential invasion site, Loch Ewe, pictured right, had to be carefully guarded nonetheless. From 1942, British, American and Canadian vessels assembled here before setting off in the Arctic convoys carrying vital supplies to Soviet Murmansk\n\nOfficers' quarters, Wolf's Lair, Poland\n\nHitler\u2019s military headquarters was staffed by a considerable pack of aides and officials. Anything up to 2,000 people worked in a complex of camouflaged bunkers and buildings that extended for several kilometres through the woods of Masuria, now northern Poland\n\nJapanese anti-aircraft gun, Mission Hill, Wewak, Papua New Guinea (left) and tank traps, Lossiemouth II, Moray, Scotland (right)\n\nThe rainforest reclaims what was once a field of battle, left. On 10 May 1945, with hostilities in Europe already over, the Pacific War was raging on unchecked. Australia\u2019s 2/4th Infantry Battalion fought hard to take this hill from its occupiers, troops of Japan\u2019s 18th Army. There is a monument now, on the summit, high above. Meanwhile, mounting a defence against an unpredictable enemy involves endlessly elaborate calculation and second-guessing. An airfield opened on the Moray coast in northeast Scotland to protect the naval port of Lossiemouth had itself to be carefully protected against attack, as these concrete tank traps, pictured, right, testify\n\nLookout, Saaremaa Island, Estonia\n\nBelieved to have been built by the Soviets as an observation post for a nearby battery (the surrounding trees have grown up since the war), this tower may have been deliberately designed to resemble one of the broken-down windmills with which this island still abounds. It was subsequently occupied by the Germans\n\nDeserted village, Tyneham, Dorset\n\nIn 1943, this haunted hamlet was requisitioned for training troops. The D-Day Landings loomed, and Britain\u2019s soldiers were going to have to find their way, under heavy fire, through similar villages across northern France\n\nPillbox at Cornelian Bay, Scarborough, Yorkshire\n\nBeing ready for anything meant preparing for everything \u2013 hence this mini-fortress on England\u2019s far-flung northeastern coast. So-called for their distinctive shape, pillboxes were placed across Britain in their thousands. Hundreds remain, looming up out of nowhere alongside country roads or \u2013 like this one \u2013 blending slowly into the coastal scene\n\nTank traps, Hollerath, Eifel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\n\nSpring comes to the Siegfried Line fortifications outside Eifel village, not far from Hellenthal, near the Belgian border. These defences did hold back the Allied advance in 1944\u20135, but only to the extent of prolonging the inevitable. The Nazi order was rapidly unravelling by then\n\nPillbox interior, RAF Biggin Hill, Kent\n\nA key Royal Air Force base protecting London during the war, fighters from Biggin Hill were responsible for shooting down more than 1,400 enemy aircraft\n\nFlak tower, Berlin\n\nBerlin's popular Humboldthain park was home to a flak tower that was built on the orders of Hitler. After the war ended, the tower was blown up by French engineers, creating a hill of rubble. However, in recent years, the tower has been restored by enthusiasts.

The skeletal remains of the dome are now a memorial to the tens of thousands who lost their lives.

The plant was bombed by the Allies in 1944 and production was moved to central Germany. Picture sourced by MailOnline Travel\n\nJapanese command post, Peleliu, Micronesia\n\nThis two-story building had been a command post for Japanese forces on the island of Peleliu in Micronesia. It was fiercely defended by the Japanese but bombed by American forces in 1944. In 1985, Peleliu was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark.

The Swiss were afraid of an invasion from the German side of the river and scattered numerous defensive structures like this along the Rhine.

It acted as a military observation post during the Second World War.

Picture sourced by MailOnline Travel\n\nTotleben Fort Island, Russia\n\nAn old concrete bunker lies abandoned on Totleben Fort Island in Russia. The island's position meant it was strategically placed to defend the south of Russia during the war.
