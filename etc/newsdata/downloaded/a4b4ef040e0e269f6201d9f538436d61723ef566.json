It was the first time the suspect, who is jailed without bond, has appeared in court to answer to the capital murder charge. Crusius, dressed in a blue blazer, white shirt and gray slacks, spoke clearly and firmly in responding to District Judge Sam Medrano\u2019s brief questions and answering \u201cnot guilty\u201d when asked to enter a plea. His next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrusius\u2019s lawyers, Mark Stevens of San Antonio and Joe Spencer of El Paso, offered their first public statements in the case after the hearing, but declined to answer questions.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I would like to say is that people who were nowhere near El Paso on August the 3rd, 2019, think they know what happened. People who were nowhere near this place already have made up their mind about what should happen,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAs they say, there are two sides to every story, and there are two sides to this story.\u201d\n\nSpencer focused on preventing a possible death sentence, saying he and Stevens are morally opposed to capital punishment.\n\n\u201cI believe that the El Paso community needs healing,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe El Paso community needs closure. And the quickest way to get closure and healing is not through seeking the death penalty.\u201d\n\nEsparza did not comment after the hearing.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove more than 600 miles from his hometown of Allen, Tex., to El Paso on Aug. 3. He allegedly went to a Walmart packed with 1,500 people on a Saturday morning \u2014 parents and children doing back-to-school shopping, senior citizens buying groceries and Mexican nationals who crossed the border to stock up on supplies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArmed with an AK-47 assault-style rifle, the gunman opened fire on people in the parking lot and continued into the store. The dead ranged in age from 15 to 90. Thirteen of the people who were killed were U.S. citizens, eight were Mexican nationals and one was a German man married to a Mexican woman and living in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\nCrusius was arrested about 40 minutes after the shooting began as he was driving about a half-mile from the Walmart. Police said in an affidavit that Crusius exited his car when state troopers pulled up behind him, raised his hands and said: \u201cI\u2019m the shooter.\u201d\n\nThe suspect told police investigators that he was targeting \u201cMexicans,\u201d according to the arrest affidavit. He also allegedly posted a hate-filled statement on the Internet minutes before the shooting began, police have said. The statement warned of a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d and complained that white people were being replaced by foreigners.\n\nThe state indictment does not accuse Crusius of a hate crime, but federal prosecutors have said they are considering such charges, which also could carry a potential death sentence if he is convicted.\n\nAD", "description": "The 21-year-old Texan accused in the deadliest attack on Hispanics in recent history, faces the possibility of a death sentence in the slayings of 22 people at a Walmart.", "authors": ["Robert Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Q-U43Oxov3gT71ztUWWnRmD70As=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5JGTZVWELII6TNPEKSVFNVNXZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
