That\u2019s where they want to go,\u201d he said.\n\nReaction to Trump\u2019s move has enraged many Republicans and Democrats.\n\nU.S. Representative Liz Cheney, a national security hawk and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said in a statement that Trump\u2019s decision would have \u201csickening and predictable consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland. This decision aids America\u2019s adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS. This action imperils American security and that of our allies. Congress must and will act to limit the catastrophic impact of this decision,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump cast his decision as in line with his long-held belief that the United States cannot be the world\u2019s policeman and must bring some troops home.\n\nBut it comes as he needs as much Republican support as possible to fight an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats who control the U.S. House of Representatives based on his attempt to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is one of Trump\u2019s closest confidants in Congress and a frequent golf partner, has angrily split with Trump over Syria.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump responds to questions about the U.S. House impeachment investigation during a formal signing ceremony for the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement at the White House in Washington, October 7, 2019.
