Now I'm terrified for my teenage sons", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s a unique feeling of terror when you\u2019re threatened with a knife. I felt it years ago on a quiet street near my home in Stockwell, South London.\n\nA young man came out of nowhere and grabbed my handbag. Rather than sensibly let him get away, I responded to the adrenaline surging through my body and raced after him, shouting.\n\nWe stared at each other briefly, and in that moment I genuinely believe he was more scared than me. He ran off with the \u00a360 I\u2019d just taken from a cashpoint, leaving my bag, Nokia brick phone and house keys.\n\nAs I picked up the handbag, I realised it had been cut and looked down to see a wide tear in my heavy raincoat. He\u2019d slashed at my clothes with a knife to get my bag \u2014 the blade millimetres from my skin. He could so easily have turned the knife against me when I chased him.\n\nSusanna Reid (pictured) who was mugged at knifepoint in South London, calls for an investment in young people at risk of getting involved in the epidemic\n\nAfterwards, there was basically nothing police could do. Overwhelmed by fear and fury, I couldn\u2019t identify the boy. I felt useless, and sensed the police were frustrated, but I was simply too shocked.\n\nFor months afterwards I feared anyone walking close to me on the street, totally losing my trust.\n\nI am now the mother of three teenage boys living in South London, not far from the site of that attack. Knife crime is far worse, and lives are being lost on a frightening scale. As I write, four young men are on trial for the murder of 17-year-old Girl Scout Jodie Chesney in a London park.\n\nThe news of each latest stabbing \u2014 like the two 17-year-olds killed in Milton Keynes at the weekend \u2014 makes me fear for my boys whenever they step out of the door. And how is the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, spending his time? Well, over the weekend, as mums like me worried about letting their children out on the streets, he joined protesters in a march \u2014 to campaign for a second referendum on Brexit.\n\nSadiq is proud of having invested \u00a315 million a year on a violence reduction unit and \u00a37 million on projects combating youth violence. But that pales in comparison to the \u00a3130 million this country would pay for the referendum he was marching for. Not to mention the \u00a337 million being spent on policing Extinction Rebellion.\n\nI know Sadiq \u2014 he is a father himself, he lives near me and I believe in his heart he is concerned about knife crime. But I was deeply disappointed to see him distracted from what he claims is his top priority, keeping Londoners safe.\n\nLast month a teenager was jailed for killing 17-year-old Malcolm Mide-Madariola outside Clapham South station, practically on my doorstep. Malcolm was a peacemaker, standing up for a friend. He was stabbed with a 12 in hunting knife.\n\nSusanna revealed Sadiq Khan (pictured centre) is among those who say solving the epidemic of knife crime will take a generation\n\nIn the wake of his death I interviewed Sadiq on Good Morning Britain. Barely able to hold in my tears, I demanded he tell parents how we could feel our children are safe. He insisted violent crime in the capital was being addressed. I wanted to believe him, but every time a young person is killed, those words ring in my ears.\n\nKnife crime has reached a record high across England and Wales, new figures show, with 44,000 incidents in the year to June \u2014 up 7 per cent.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to join the dots on what\u2019s causing this. How could the Government think getting rid of 20,000 frontline police officers across the UK over the past eight years was a good idea? In London, numbers dropped to a 15-year low. The Tories have promised to recruit 20,000 new police officers but that needs to happen fast.\n\nOff-air gossip Shouty Piers is off GMB for half-term, replaced by the gentle tones of Ben Shephard. Ben is full of surprises: he once had a cameo in Friends, and appeared in Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince. My only role was in animated Justin Timberlake movie Trolls. But as I played his GRANDMOTHER . . . it\u2019s not one I\u2019m putting on my CV!\n\nWe need a pincer movement to tackle crime \u2014 and its causes. Restoring police budgets across the country must come first.\n\nWe must also invest in young people at risk, to keep them on the straight and narrow. Otherwise gangs are only too happy to step into the gap. Youth clubs are vital as are programmes like Divert, which works with under-25s who have been arrested.\n\nThe crime against me was fleeting. I lost just a small amount of money, a degree of trust and a raincoat. But I am broken by the agony of those who have suffered the worst. The loss of a child, a sibling, a parent.\n\nTo those including Sadiq Khan who say solving the epidemic of knife crime will take a generation. Sorry, but our children don\u2019t have that long. And they deserve better.\n\nJennifer Aniston told her co-star Reese Witherspoon (pictured together) that the secret of her slim figure is celery juice\n\nNo celery juice on my morning show!\n\nJennifer Aniston\u2019s revealed the secret of her slim figure at 50. Celery juice. Jen shared her healthy advice with friend and co-star Reese Witherspoon, who\u2019s a convert.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of good influence every woman needs. The pair are co-starring in The Morning Show, about a daily news programme.\n\nWish I could ask my co-hosts for diet tips \u2014 but I\u2019d be eating Laura Tobin\u2019s Haribos, Kate Garraway\u2019s chocolates and Piers Morgan\u2019s banana sandwiches. And something tells me I wouldn\u2019t end up looking like Jennifer Aniston.\n\nWhy does everyone keep on blubbing?\n\nWill and Janette (pictured) had waterworks with their performance on week five of Strictly\n\nWeek five on Strictly and the waterworks were in full flow as Will and Janette performed their frankly gorgeous Couple\u2019s Choice dance.\n\nLast week it was Katya who broke down in tears when she and \u2018Magic\u2019 Mike Bushell got through their Quickstep without falling over.\n\nThis week Mike went from Magic to Tragic and ended up in the dance-off \u2014 cue another emotional week, I\u2019m sure. So why can\u2019t they all just stop blubbing?\n\nI remember, when I first signed up for the show, a friend warning me not to get sucked into the \u2018Strictly Bubble\u2019.\n\nWell good luck with that. Strictly becomes the centre of your world because you work at it so intensely.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of madness \u2014then come Christmas the bubble bursts and you\u2019re left scratching your head, wondering what got you so worked up.\n\nThis week\u2019s guilty click\n\nSusanna revealed that she's currently a fan of Lakeland\u2019s Hot Chocolate Melt (pictured)\n\nHot chocolate melt from Lakeland, \u00a32.99\n\nAs the cold weather bites, I\u2019m salivating over Lakeland\u2019s Hot Chocolate Melt \u2014 a hollow ball of chocolate you pour hot milk over to create a tasty warming drink.\n\nThe ball\u2019s outer coating melts \u2014 and then the mini marshmallows inside float to the top like magic. Who can resist a clever hot choc at this time of year?", "description": "Susanna Reid was mugged at knifepoint a few years ago in Stockwell, South London.
