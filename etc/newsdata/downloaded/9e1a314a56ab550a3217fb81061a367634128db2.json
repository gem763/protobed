Then the briefers sit in the Oval Office with the president while he speaks on the phone with the foreign leader. \"At least two members of the NSC are usually present,\" according to USA Today.\n\nThere will also be officials sitting in a secure room in another part of the White House, listening to the president's call and taking notes. Their notes are known as a \"memorandum of telephone conversation\", and like many things in Washington it has an abbreviation: \"memcon\".\n\nThe president's calls with foreign leaders are also transcribed by computers. Afterwards, as former White House officials explain, the human note takers compare their impressions with an electronic version of the call. The notes from the officials and from the computerised transcriptions are combined into one document. This transcript may not be perfect, but it is done as carefully as time and resources allow.\n\nIn the case of the president's phone call with Mr Zelensky, according to the whistleblower's complaint, about a dozen people were listening to their conversation.\n\nSince Mr Trump came to office, briefings before a phone call can be hastily arranged and by people with varying levels of expertise, according to one former NSC official, who says they were sometimes asked to listen in on calls at the last minute.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump speaking on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2017 as officials take notes\n\nHow is a transcript of a call classified as secret or top secret?\n\nOfficials who work in the executive secretary's office of the US national security council decide on the level of classification for the transcript of a call, explain former White House officials.\n\nIf the transcript contains information that could put national security or lives of individuals at risk, the transcript is classified as top secret and is kept in a protected area.\n\nThe Project on Middle East Democracy's Andrew Miller oversaw Egypt for the national security council during the Obama administration and became familiar with the process of classification. Miller says that he understands why some transcripts should be deemed top secret. But, he says, there was nothing in the call between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky that rose to that level.\n\n\"I don't see what's in there that would justify it being top secret,\" says Mr Miller. \"This had to be done for political reasons.\"\n\nMore on the Trump-Ukraine story\n\nWhat happens if a transcript is stamped 'top secret'?\n\nClassifying the transcript of a call as \"top secret\" means that only individuals in the US government with the highest level of security clearance can see the material.\n\nAs former officials explain, these transcripts are shared through a system known by an acronym, Jwics, which stands for Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, a network that is used by people who work in the intelligence services.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Trump didn't do anything wrong' - US citizens react\n\nFrequently, though, the transcripts are stored in areas that are secret but not guarded with this extraordinary level of security.\n\nClassifying a transcript as secret - but not top secret - means that officials can discuss the contents of the presidents' calls more easily with others who work in the government.\n\nWas the security-classification system used in the proper manner in this case?\n\nMr Kudlow and other presidential advisers say the phone call itself was fine - and so was the handling of the transcript. They strongly disagree with the whistleblower's assessment. But others say the president's phone call and the secrecy surrounding the transcript demonstrated an abuse of presidential power.\n\n\"Security classifications are designed to protect lives,\" says Brett Bruen, a White House official who served in the Obama administration. \"If all of a sudden, they become a means to protect the political standing of the president, it means we no longer have a national-security classification system that is credible.\"\n\nMr Miller agrees - he says that keeping a transcript of a phone call secret just because you want to protect the political prospects of your boss undermines the system.\n\nThose who work at the White House swear an oath not to the president, he says, but to the US constitution: \"Your primary loyalty should be to the country - not to the individual.\"", "description": "A whistleblower has shone a spotlight on the practice of hearing and recording calls from the Oval Office.", "authors": ["Tara Mckelvey", "Bbc White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14BB8/production/_109002948_gettyimages-1024542828.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
