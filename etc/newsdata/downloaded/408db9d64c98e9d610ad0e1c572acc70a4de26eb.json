He indicated he wanted to prevent Republicans from defending the president and compared the inquiry to a \u201cgrand jury\u201d:\n\nThe Republicans would like nothing better because they view their role as defending the president, being the president\u2019s lawyers. If witnesses could tailor their testimony to other witnesses. They would love for one witness to be able to hear what another witness says so that they can know what they can give away and what they can\u2019t give away. There\u2019s a reason why investigations and grand jury proceedings for example, and I think this is analogous to a grand jury proceeding, are done out of the public view initially. Now we may very well call some of the same witnesses or all the same witnesses in public hearings as well. But we want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests.\n\nSchiff\u2019s comments prompted a scathing Wall Street Journal editorial on Monday. It said:\n\nA grand jury? As Mr. Schiff knows, a grand jury is a criminal proceeding. Impeachment is a political process in which the House defines the meaning of \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors.\u2019 Mr. Schiff wants it both ways: Run his secret hearings like a criminal grand jury, but then impeach Mr. Trump of political offenses even if the President committed no crime. And he wants to keep it all secret so Mr. Trump and his \u2018legal minions\u2019\u2014i.e., his lawyers and the House minority\u2014don\u2019t have access to the evidence he will use against the President. Oh, and he says contrary evidence will be fabricated\u2014an accusation of a crime in advance but with no evidence. With his every statement and action, Mr. Schiff is making Mr. Trump\u2019s case that this impeachment is a rigged game.\n\nOn Monday, Schiff kicked out Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), a member of the Judiciary Committee, from attending a closed-door impeachment inquiry hearing with former senior National Security Council official Fiona Hill.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) directed the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees to run the impeachment inquiry instead of the House Judiciary Committee, although Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) had initially began so-called formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nGaetz told Breitbart News on Monday that Pelosi did so to exclude some of the president\u2019s top supporters on the Judiciary Committee, but also because Nadler was not producing results.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi has chosen to reshuffle the legislative deck because her Democrats were getting worked silly on the Judiciary Committee following the Lewandowski hearing, the John Dean hearing, it really was not a forum that fielded results for Democrats,\u201d he said recalling previous hearings with witnesses Corey Lewandowski and former Nixon counsel John Dean.\n\n\u201cBut just because you don\u2019t like the outcome doesn\u2019t mean that the Speaker and the Democrat leadership should be excluding members who want to participate in a process that could ultimately overturn an election,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nThe WSJ editorial said Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment inquiry made it difficult for the public to discern the truth:\n\nMrs. Pelosi took the impeachment reins away from Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and handed them to Mr. Schiff, who has been running secret hearings as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Witnesses testify behind closed doors, and Democrats selectively leak the testimony or evidence to the pro-impeachment press in ways that are often distorted or incomplete.\n\n\u201cRepublicans then offer a competing narrative, and the public is left to wonder what\u2019s true. All of this is supposedly in service to the serious purpose of removing a President elected by 63 million Americans,\u201d it said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Schiff is likening his closed-door impeachment inquiry of President Trump to a \"grand jury\" despite it not being a criminal trial.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Adam-Schiff-6-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
