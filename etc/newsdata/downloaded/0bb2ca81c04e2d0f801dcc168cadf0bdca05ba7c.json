The idea was to add texture to the weekly reporting of high-frequency data by pushing beyond the headlines, just like policy makers do. The post-crisis economy doesn\u2019t behave like it did before the Great Recession. Analysis based on superficial readings quite likely will be wrong.\n\nWe retained a few of the most popular figures, such as the monthly jobless rate, but opted against incorporating most of them, including the Consumer Price Index, since inflation figures can be easily found at the Bank of Canada\u2019s website. Our dashboard is an assembly of the nontraditional indicators that various Bank of Canada officials have flagged as significant in recent years. It\u2019s not comprehensive, but it\u2019s the richest display of Canadian economic data that won\u2019t cost you hundreds of dollars a month.\n\nSome context first: Canada\u2019s economy is doing OK. Hiring appears to have plateaued, but at a very high level. Full employment is forcing employers to offer higher wages to get the workers they need. The number of active jobseekers without work for a year or more is back at average levels after a post-crisis surge.\n\nBut there are some worrisome trends in the data. Business investment in machinery and equipment plunged in the second quarter, offsetting an equally big increase at the start of the year. An engine that the Bank of Canada is counting on to drive growth has turned sluggish.\n\nThat has been happening around the world because the trade wars are choking global commerce. Canada is no different. Exports of services, a bright spot that was providing a partial offset to weaker oil prices, have slowed and non-energy merchandise exports plunged in June. Business investment tends to follow exports because strong global demand gives companies a reason to expand. At present, the signal the global economy is sending is to proceed with caution.\n\nMost of the world\u2019s other central banks have responded to that signal by lowering interest rates in recent months. The Bank of Canada resisted the urge, rightfully so given the strength of domestic indicators such as employment. But those also have softened. Household spending increased only 0.1 per cent in the second quarter, despite wage increases and a low jobless rate.\n\nThe Bank of Canada may soon follow its peers.", "description": "Financial Post columnist Kevin Carmichael goes behind today's data headlines to uncover the trends that matter to monetary policy", "authors": ["Kevin Carmichael", "Gigi Suhanic"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/fp-economics-dashboard-commodities-logo.png?w=640", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
