But producers had a change of heart after witnessing the strong chemistry between his Jesse Pinkman character and Bryan Cranston\u2019s Walter White in a pilot.\n\nThe decision to keep the story revolved around the duo for five seasons panned out for the series, which won several Golden Globe and Emmy awards. Paul won three supporting actor Emmys for his breakout portrayal of the overly emotional, loud-mouth and meth-taking Pinkman.\n\nNow, Paul returns as Pinkman in the Netflix film \u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,\u201d which premieres Friday on the streaming service. The movie has cameos from some of the show\u2019s best characters.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic between Walter and Jesse changed the whole dynamic of the series and my life,\u201d said Paul, who has gone on to star in the TV series \u201cThe Path\u201d as well as the films \u201cNeed for Speed\u201d and \u201cCentral Intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a role of a lifetime,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI thought I said goodbye to this guy years ago. So, it\u2019s sort of nice to revisit in this state of mind and continue this journey with him. Then reconnecting with everyone from the show. It was like a family reunion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreaking Bad\u201d concluded its five-year run on AMC in 2013. The show primarily focused on White, a high school chemistry teacher struggling to financially support his family, including a son who has cerebral palsy and has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\nIn desperation, White uses an old RV as a place to build a lucrative meth empire with the help of Pinkman, a former student, before their drug operation turns violent. The series ended with White dying from a gunshot wound after using a remote-controlled machine gun to kill an Aryan Brotherhood gang and free Pinkman, who had been held captive for six months.\n\n\u201cEl Camino\u201d picks up after a scar-faced, dusty Pinkman flees the bloody scene in a stolen El Camino vehicle. The story focuses on Pinkman as he tries to escape his former drug life to start anew while on the run from the police.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a different person,\u201d Paul said of Pinkman. \u201cJesse has gone through torture and chaos. He\u2019s a combination of all those things that happened to him in the past. He\u2019s escaping from captivity. He\u2019s been there for half a year. He\u2019s been tortured and forced to cook a drug that has completely destroyed his life and destroyed the lives around him. He lost the love of his life. \u2026 When we last saw him, he was screaming in sort of a relief and also agony. He\u2019s laughing and crying all at once.\u201d\n\nPaul said the film answers the question he\u2019s heard almost every day since \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d ended: \u201cWhat happened to Jesse?\u201d The actor said venturing back into Pinkman\u2019s story was an \u201citch that needed to be scratched\u201d by \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d creator Vince Gilligan, who also directed, produced and wrote the film.\n\n\u201cIt felt like there was still more story to tell,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey left the unknown in the series finale, which was beautiful. When I was asked about coming onto this project, I was onboard instantly. You know, I trust Vince so much. I thought the ending was perfect for this film. But I also know that Vince wouldn\u2019t just tell a story to just tell one. There\u2019s a reason behind it. I was excited to go on this journey with him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Jonathan Landrum Jr. on Twitter: http://twitter.com/MrLandrum31\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Aaron Paul's character in the popular series \"Breaking Bad\" was supposed to get killed off at the end of the first season.
