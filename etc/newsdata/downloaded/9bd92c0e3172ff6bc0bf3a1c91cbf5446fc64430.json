He planned it for weeks, ordered & paid for everybody\u2019s shoes and enlisted other clubhouse leaders (including Jacob deGrom) to get everyone on board. pic.twitter.com/fiJbYCU8mq \u2014 Tim Healey (@timbhealey) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cFor me, it came from a place where I wanted to show support, not to just the victims but the families as well, because no one knows how deep those emotional scars can be,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cI just wanted to show recognition to all the ordinary people who felt a sense of urgency and an admirable call of duty. It\u2019s for all the people that lost their lives and all the people that did so much to help.\u201d\n\nMaking the major-league minimum, Alonso risked a hefty fine from MLB for circumventing the rules with the cleats. But, MLB will not be fining or disciplining Alonso, a source told SNY\u2019s Andy Martino.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the impressive rookie has made an effort to help offset the impact of the 2001 terrorist attacks. In July, Alonso donated $50,000 of his $1 million prize to the Tunnels to Towers Foundation after winning the All-Star Home Run Derby.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
