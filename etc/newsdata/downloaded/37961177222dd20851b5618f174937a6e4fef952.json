We will have to live with those consequences. As a league, we're not willing to compromise those values.\"\n\nThe full cost might not be known for months, with the NBA having made lucrative deals to a nation of 1.4 billion that loves basketball. But the lawmakers demanded values win over profits.\n\n\"Equivocating when profits are at stake is a betrayal of fundamental American values,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"That you have more potential fans in China than in Hong Kong is no excuse for bending over backwards to express 'sensitivity' only to one side.\"\n\nA worker removes an NBA promotional banner from a building after China shut down NBA sponsorships and telecast plans following a tweet by an NBA club executive supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong\n\nLawmakers urged Silver to take four steps to harden the NBA's stance against China's retaliatory moves, most notably shutting down NBA activities in China, where two pre-season exhibition games were slated to be played.\n\n\"The NBA should have anticipated the challenges of doing business in a country run by a repressive single party government, including by being prepared to stand in strong defense of the freedom of expression of its employees, players, and affiliates across the globe,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThey also pushed for an end to punishments to the Rockets, saying the NBA must be united against \"future efforts by Chinese government-controlled entities to single out individual teams, players, or associates for boycotts or selective treatment.\"\n\nThat would also include NBA stars with major sponsor deals in China, including LeBron James, James Harden and now-retired Kobe Bryant.\n\nLawmakers want Silver to \"re-evaluate\" having an NBA Academy in Xinjiang, \"where up to a million Chinese citizens are held in concentration camps as part of a massive government-run campaign of ethno-religious repression.\" About 240 teens are housed in the education and fitness centers.\n\n- Lawmakers fear self-censorship -\n\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and political rivals such as Texan Ted Cruz united in a letter to NBA commissioner Adam Silver asking him to suspend all NBA activities in China until boycotts by businesses and telecasters are ended\n\nThe threat of capitulating on free speech issues to Chinese Communist Party censorship by the NBA and other businesses was a major emphasis for lawmakers.\n\n\"We would hope to see Americans standing up and speaking out in defense of the rights of the people of Hong Kong,\" the letter said, saying pressure on Morey to back away from his tweet \"sold out an American citizen.\"\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that individuals associated with the league may now engage in self-censorship that is inconsistent with American and the league's stated values.\n\n\"This is an outcome that Americans reject, and one that you should reject -- especially given that the NBA represents a unique brand for which there is no competition inside or outside China.\"\n\nA hard split could leave basketball-hungry fans in China struggling for banished NBA news, much like baseball fans in Communist Cuba struggled for news on US major league teams.\n\nLawmakers asked Silver to support the rights for all NBA players, staff, partners and fans to express their opinions no matter the economic repercussions and stress that while Chinese law will be respected in China, American laws and principles will govern global NBA operations.\n\nThey also want Silver to clarify in NBA documents that \"public commentary on international human rights repression -- including in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang --falls within expected standards of public behavior and expression.\"", "description": "A bipartisan set of US lawmakers urged the NBA on Wednesday to suspend all activities in China until Chinese firms and broadcasters end their boycott of the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/01/wire-19519160-1570667860-732_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
