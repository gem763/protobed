Photographer Liisa Jokinen caught plenty of stylish people basking in the sunlight outside shows for Kate Spade and Helmut Lang, and even more at Spring Studios, locus for many of the week\u2019s events. Scroll down to see 14 fashion people \u2014 stylists, writers, influencers, and designers \u2014 explain how they decided what to wear to the shows.\n\nBrandon Foster, \u201cTwenty-something,\u201d Stylist and Creative Director\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a suit by Ruojing Wang, a blouse and hat by Megan O\u2019Cain, shoes from Bershka, a bag from Topshop, and vintage earrings. It was very cold and rainy yesterday, so I wanted to be warm yet comfortable and functional today. My style is inspired by New York City, references from the past, and my own emotions. I know it can be risky, but what\u2019s the point of being in fashion if you can\u2019t take risks?\u201d\n\nInstagram: @thebrandonfoster\n\nKatie Ruensumran, Creative Consultant\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Simone Rocha because I never need a reason to wear beautiful clothes. People inspire my style. My style philosophy: No rules!\u201d\n\nInstagram: @katieismonster\n\nSamantha Lauren, 28, Influencer and Content Creator\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a top from Majorelle, pants from Lovers + Friends, Tibi shoes, and a Louis Vuitton bag. I love getting inspiration from street style. It\u2019s so fun to see how other people put together different looks and make trends their own.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @whatwouldkikiwear\n\nNatasha Shangari Mwashighadi, 21, Designer and Stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cThe top and purse are vintage and thrifted. The trousers I\u2019m wearing I designed and made myself. The specific colorway represents the Maasai tribe of Kenya. The necklaces with scissor pendants: I chose these as a reference to cutting cloth, since I\u2019m a fashion designer, but they also represent duality which reflects my personality. I am inspired by current events, my experiences, and my Kenyan heritage.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @natashashangari\n\nElizabeth Tamkin, 27, Market Strategist at Man Repeller\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing YanYan pants, a Bandier top with a green Lonely bralette, Chanel boots, an Emily Levine bag, Karen Walker men\u2019s sunglasses, assorted jewelry from Sandralexandra and Missoma, and an eyeglass chain from Banana Legion. It\u2019s Saturday so I wanted my butt to be cozy (especially to offset the less-comfortable boots). The women I work with inspire my style. I focus a lot on silhouette. My style philosophy: Wear whatever the heck you like.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @elizcardinal\n\nMitch McGuire, 27, Stylist and Editor of Refigural\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Thierry Mugler shirt, Jean-Paul Gaultier pants from James Veloria, a Goddess bag, Troentorps clogs, Rosenthal Studio bracelet, Linie necklace, Todd Oldham belt and keychain, Maximum Henry glasses, Axel S silver earring, and Anglea Cummings shell earring \u2014 vintage. I wanted to dress to the mood of Christopher John Rogers: shiny evening fantasy with a sharp sense of humor. I\u2019m inspired by old movies and commercials, art, and reality television \u2014 and, right now, Ashley Tisdale\u2019s red-carpet wardrobe of the early aughts. My style philosophy is: Look in the mirror before you leave the house and put one more thing on.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @mitch.mcguire\n\nYolande Macon, 30, Content Creator\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI wanted to wear something sexy, playful, and mature. I\u2019ve been so in love with baby blue and had to do an outfit around it. My style is inspired by the past: I love seeing fearless, free women like Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Chaka Khan.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @thelanguageofyolande\n\nJo Rosenthal, 24, Writer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI am wearing a vintage blazer, Saks Potts pants, and Gucci loafers. I wanted to wear something sparkly so I put on those pants. I try to wear clothes that make me feel the most like \u2018me\u2019.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @justjorosenthal\n\nSophia Macks, 30, Creative Director and Founder of Beyond the Mag\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing full MSGM. The shoes are Louboutin and the bag is Chanel. My 3-year-old self inspires my style. Wear the clothes, don\u2019t let them wear you.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @beyondthemag\n\nBrittany Rose Byrd, 31, Host of the YouTube Show Vintage Forum\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing all thrifted/vintage pieces from LTrain in Brooklyn, NY; Buffalo Exchange in Manhattan, NY; and Retropolis in Houston, TX. I\u2019m a firm believer in sustainable fashion. Thrifting is a true passion of mine. I\u2019m inspired by the \u201930s, the \u201940s, the \u201960s, and the \u201970s. I\u2019m able to pick what I like from specific eras and put my own modern twist on it. What I choose to wear is a form of expression, and I like to save my money during the process.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @iambrittanyrose_\n\nSamuel Hine, 26, Associate Style Editor at GQ\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Telfar x Budweiser tee, Wrangler jeans tie-dyed by Zak Syroka, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Docs. Teenage skateboarders inspire my style. My style philosophy comes from John Mayer: \u2018Wearing bad hats is the only path to a good hat.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstagram: @samuelhine\n\nMecca James-Williams, 26, Stylist and Contributing Editor at The Zoe Report\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Nikki Chassin skirt and Camper shoes. The bag is Alfeya Valrina and the earrings are Edas. It feels like summer is still here, and I wanted to wear bright colors to match that.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @meccajw\n\nHelena Kontos, 25, Painter and Associate Market Editor at Modern Luxury Magazine\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage scarf and jumpsuit, Chloe glasses, Zara boots, and a Demellier bag that I painted on. This outfit felt fun on a Saturday. Vintage clothing inspires my style.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @helena_kontos\n\nAnna Sarlvit, 20, Influencer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage dress and blazer, Asics, and a By Far bag. I love to mix strong colors and just bought the dress yesterday so really wanted to try it out. Old women, movies, and people on Instagram inspire me the most.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @annasarlvit", "description": "Liisa Jokinen shoots New Yorkers with fearless personal style at her site NYC-Looks.
