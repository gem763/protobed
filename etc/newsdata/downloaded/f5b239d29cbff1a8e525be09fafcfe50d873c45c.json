(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nAlek Minassian, the 26-year-old man accused of killing 10 people with a rented Ryder van in Toronto on April 23, 2018, told police that he\u2019s an involuntary celibate (incel) and that he was radicalised online through websites like Reddit and 4Chan, according to a police interrogation that took place shortly after the attack.\n\nMinassian, charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder, said \u201cI feel like I accomplished my mission,\u201d in a newly released video from the interrogation. Minassian can be seen speaking with a police detective about his attack and said that his goal was to put the \u201cnormies in a state of panic.\u201d\n\nThe alleged killer makes it clear that he found a community of similarly alienated men online and makes multiple references to hateful ideologies and symbols, including Pepe the frog, a white supremacist mascot, though it\u2019s not clear that racism was a primary motivator for the attack. Minassian can even remember that he first visited 4Chan on May 23, 2014.\n\n\u201cAnd how are you able to remember that?\u201d the detective asks when Minassian cites the specific date.\n\nMinassian said that May 23, 2014 was \u201ca very significant day\u201d when \u201cElliot Rodger committed an uprising against the Chads and the Stacys.\u201d Chads is a reference to a category of men that incels simultaneously admire and hate for their ability to attract women. Stacys are the category of women that incels find attractive and are often depicted as the girlfriends of Chads.\n\nMinassian can be heard in the video describing Rodger\u2019s massacre, which killed six people in California in 2014, as a \u201cbeta uprising,\u201d a reference to \u201cbeta males.\u201d Beta males is a derogatory term often used in far-right forums for weak men who are unattractive to women.\n\nMinassian also cites another mass killer as inspiration, Chris Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old man in Oregon who killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in October of 2015. Harper-Mercer engaged in a shootout with police before eventually killing himself. Minassian tells the detective that he made contact with both Harper-Mercer and Rodger online before they committed their attacks.\n\nMinassian repeatedly uses strange, irony-laden lingo during the interrogation \u2014 phrases that are commonplace on extremist forums like 4Chan. At one point in the video the detective asks him how Rodger staged his \u201cuprising\u201d in California and Minassian replies that he \u201cused a gun as well as a vehicle to convert the life status of certain individuals into a death status to carry the message that incels can\u2019t be oppressed.\u201d Minassian appears to use strange wording throughout the interrogation to avoid words like murder and death.\n\nThe detective asks Minassian how he first made contact with Rodger, and the alleged killer said that he first found Rodger on Reddit in January of 2014 before following him to 4Chan in May of that year.\n\nMinassian said that he started planning the attack about a month before but had been seething with anger for years before that. He wanted to be killed by a police officer but couldn\u2019t properly fake having a gun and get the cops to shoot.\n\nAccording to Canada\u2019s National Post, the judge in this case was initially hesitant to release documents and video about the interrogation. But media organisations successfully lobbied to get the materials released because Minassian\u2019s case will not be heard by a jury and instead will be decided by a judge.\n\nThe detective asks Minassian what he would do if the families of his victims were in front of him.\n\n\u201cWould you apologise?\u201d the detective asks.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d Minassian replies.\n\nIf you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts please call Lifeline on 13 11 14.", "description": "Alek Minassian, the 26-year-old man accused of killing 10 people with a rented Ryder van in Toronto on April 23, 2018, told police that he\u2019s an involuntary celibate (incel) and that he was radicalised online through websites like Reddit and 4Chan, according to a police interrogation that took place shortly after the...", "authors": ["Tom Mckay", "Julie Muncy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dpn5hitsic8os7bnl4ny.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
