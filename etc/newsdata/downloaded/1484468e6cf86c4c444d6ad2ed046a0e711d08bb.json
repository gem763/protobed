Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPittsburgh Steelers linebacker Anthony Chickillo was arrested early Sunday morning and charged with simple assault, criminal mischief and harassment, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.\n\nDetails surrounding the alleged incident were unclear, though the newspaper reported the arrest occurred in southern Pennsylvania. It added Chickillo, 26, was arraigned before 8 a.m. ET Sunday, released on bond and scheduled to return to court for a preliminary hearing later this month.\n\nWTAE reported Chickillo was arrested following an altercation with his girlfriend. If the report is accurate, it\u2019s possible the NFL could put Chickillo on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list, which often occurs with players involved in domestic violence cases.\n\nA Steelers spokesperson released a statement saying, \u201cWe are aware of an incident involving Anthony Chickillo last night and are still gathering information. Until we have further details we will not provide any further comments.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers (2-4) were on a bye this weekend and will play host to the Miami Dolphins on Oct. 28.\n\nChickillo, a sixth-round draft pick in 2015 out of Miami (Fla.), signed a two-year, $8 million contract before the season. A foot injury has limited him to three games this season, in which he has three assisted tackles and 0.5 sacks.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Anthony Chickillo was arrested early Sunday morning and charged with simple assault, criminal mischief and harassment, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443210067&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K06F-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
