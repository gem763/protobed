The atrocities of apartheid and the injustices watered down by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) are still raw memories.\n\nIt is off-putting to imagine that in a country with a history such as ours sane people can believe that race is a non-factor in the class, economic and political set up of this country.\n\nSouth Africa is a unique country in that, to a large extent, one\u2019s race determines where one finds her/himself positioned in the economic chain.\n\nIt is incontestable that the economy and the land are in the control of the white minority and any party that defends the grip that whites have on the economy and the land will be their inevitable choice.\n\nIt was therefore not a surprise that when Maimane acknowledged and spoke out on the need for some deliberate effort to circumvent the plight of black people, he was purged by those who sought to solidify and legitimise the racially wedged injustices the country has come to embrace and normalise.\n\nOnce we indulge the facade of non-racialism \u2013 the belief that race is an insignificant non-factor \u2013 we will be foregoing reason.\n\nWe ought to take a hard look at the very concept of non-racialism and how this concept behaves like a kind of brain virus infecting a multitude of people.\n\nIt acts as a blockage to the reconciliation project and masquerades itself as a dressed wound that replicates itself as a cancer to the true reconciliation project that we, as a country could be taking.\n\nThe concept ought to be viewed as dubious, immoral and illusionist. Non-racialism in the context of the racially dictated realities of South Africans should be scrutinised far more critically than it currently is.\n\nIf that scrutiny does one thing, it is my hope that it encourages people to start questioning why a black Maimane was smeared, discarded and eventually found himself having no choice but to bow out of a party he had long perceived to be carrying his aspirations of a non-racial society.\n\nYou will also need to ask yourself why and how it is that the DA is on a deliberate effort to reclaim its white face if indeed non-racialism is an aspiration of it.\n\nSouth Africa is a beautiful basket of black, white, Indian, Coloured, Khoi-San, Asian and more who want to enjoy the beauty of it because they are motivated by the opportunities that could be brought by unity and the prospect of Mandela and Tutu\u2019s Rainbow Nation.\n\nOf course politics and the discourses that are a by-product of it are important but as we wake up to the huge challenge of the road we need to travel in our reconciliation and understanding one another let us not forget the elephant in the room \u2013 the denial of the role of race in South Africa\u2019s social, economic and political discourse.\n\n\u2022 Gcina Mtengwane is a lecturer in the Community Development Programme of the QwaQwa Campus of the University of the Free State.
