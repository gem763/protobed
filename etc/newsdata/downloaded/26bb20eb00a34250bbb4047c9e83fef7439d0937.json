I could draw you a detailed architectural map of both homes. I remember the hidden staircase to the roof at matamaal, the heavy curtains I wrapped around myself, until I dislodged a family of mice.\n\nAfternoons cleaning string beans and corn from the vegetable patch. The time my mother told me not to play badminton in the evening, and it got so dark that I smacked a shrieking bat instead of the shuttlecock. I woke up once in the middle of the night and saw a bear dancing on its hind legs on the lawn. Nobody believes me about this one, but it happened.\n\nAfter one of many picnics in Pahalgam, a hill town so picturesque you can see it in every Bollywood movie, I was halfway through a tourist-trap horse ride before realizing a pound of chocolate-covered walnuts was too many.\n\nThis is all to say: Have you ever heard people talk about how incredible Kashmir was? How beautiful, how peaceful? \u201cParadise on Earth\u201d is the clich\u00e9, right? It was absolutely all of that, no exaggeration. To my 9-year-old self, it was the most magical, joyful place in the world.\n\nAt the same time, being Kashmiri has always been difficult. My parents\u2019 generation had seen two wars between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, followed by an insurgency against Indian rule and rapid militarization in the winter of 1989-90. When the violence began, many Pandits, as Kashmiri Hindus are known, were targeted and killed by militants, which terrified us, leading to rushed middle-of-the-night departures by most of our community, including my extended family. I realize I recite these facts simply and without emotion, as a child would. That is so I don\u2019t cry.\n\nWe were last at our house in August 1989, and it is now a pile of rubble, I think. The roof was burned off by militants, and snow seeped in to dissolve the rest. In a lifetime of talking to my parents every day, I have never asked for updates. I didn\u2019t want to know, didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I hear my beloved matamaal is a tech sales center. Even typing this out makes my heart clench, and I go back to the drawings in my head.\n\nI have mapped out the houses, room by room, obsessively, for the past 30 years, so that I can remember them. Because I can\u2019t (or won\u2019t?) revisit, it is my only way to access the happiness of those summers at home in Kashmir. It is why I try to make a home everywhere I go. Feeling at home grounds me. It makes me feel the loss less.", "description": "A writer tries to make a home everywhere to dull the pain of losing hers after militants targeted the Hindu minority when the insurgency against India erupted.", "authors": ["Priyanka Mattoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12mattoo/12mattoo-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
