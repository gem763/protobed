REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo\n\nIn early Asian trade, the dollar was steady at 108.35 JPY= against the yen, still not far from its 2-1/2-month high of 108.63 yen marked on Friday.\n\nThe euro also stood flat at $1.1026 EUR= versus the greenback, off Friday's three-week high of $1.1062.\n\nAlthough markets initially welcomed the \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal between the United States and China that President Donald Trump outlined last week, a lack of details kept many investors cautious.\n\n\u201cMedia reports suggest China wants another high-level meeting later this month to finalize Friday\u2019s agreement, suggesting that not all the details are nailed down,\u201d said Alex Stanley, senior interest rate strategist at National Australia Bank.\n\n\u201cMarket participants are conscious that previous U.S.-China \u2018agreements\u2019 have subsequently broken down amidst misunderstandings among the two sides.\u201d\n\nA Bloomberg report on Monday, citing sources, said China wants more talks as soon as the end of October to hammer out the details of Trump\u2019s phase 1 deal before Chinese President Xi Jinping agrees to sign it.\n\nThe negotiation between the UK and the European Union over Britain\u2019s exit also looked equally fleeting.\n\nSterling slipped from a three-month high touched on Friday as last week's euphoria gave way to doubts over whether a timely Brexit deal could be clinched. The pound was last quoted at $1.2604 GBP= versus the dollar, little changed on the day.\n\nA deal to smooth Britain\u2019s departure from the EU hung in the balance on Monday after diplomats indicated the bloc wanted more concessions from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said a full agreement was unlikely this week.\n\nJohnson says he wants to strike an exit deal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly departure on Oct. 31. If an agreement is not possible, he says he will lead the United Kingdom out of the club it joined in 1973 without a deal - even though parliament has passed a law saying he cannot do so.\n\nThe lira showed limited reaction after Trump imposed new sanctions on Turkey, but the currency stayed near seven-week lows against the dollar on concerns about a fallout from the country\u2019s incursion in northern Syria.\n\nIn early Asia, the lira stood at 5.9239 per dollar TRYTOM=D4, after having weakened some 0.8% on Monday.", "description": "The dollar hovered below 2-1/2-month highs against the yen on Tuesday, failing to extend recent gains as optimism over trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies and for an orderly British exit from the European Union started to fade.", "authors": ["Tomo Uetake", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440910885&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E01A", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
