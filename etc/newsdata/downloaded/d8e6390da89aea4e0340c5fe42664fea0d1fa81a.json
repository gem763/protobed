Still, the value quotient prevailed in the market on economic worries. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nTops\n\nSeptember went well for the S&P 500 as evident from the $9.48-billion of inflows intoSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX: ) and $1.97 billion into iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV. News of U.S.-China trade talks scheduled for October probably boosted the broader market.\n\nSmall-Caps Gain\n\nSmall-cap ETF iShares ETF IWM accumulated about $3.64 billion in assets in the month. A dovish Fed, trade war tensions, global growth worries, geopolitical risks, compelling valuation and a decently growing U.S. economy have probably worked in favor of pint-sized stocks.\n\nInternational Bond Market in Fine Fettle\n\nFixed income ETFs did well in September as the global market was hurt by the U.S.-China trade tiff. Plus, there was a rout in the market caused by an oil attack on Saudi oilfield. Owing to global growth worries, several developed and emerging economies slashed rates. The ECB will also restart bond purchases of 20 billion euros a month in November.\n\nVanguard Total International Bond ETF BNDX amassed $2.68 billion in September and long-term U.S. fund iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ: ) ETF (NZ: ) garnered about $2.42 billion. Meanwhile, iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (TSXV: ) raked in about $1.58 billion.\n\nGold Continued to Glitter\n\nGold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Trust (P: ) (TSXV: ) fetched about $2.18 billion in assets. Since Saudi oil attack and talks of Trump impeachment made the markets edgy in September, safe-haven metal gold hogged investors\u2019 attention (read: Guide to 10 Most-Heavily Traded ETFs).\n\nLow-Volatility ETFs in Investors\u2019 Favor\n\nLow-volatility products have the potential to outpace the broader market during turbulent times, providing significant protection to the portfolio. These funds comprise more stable stocks that have seen the least price movement. Thanks to heightened market volatility, iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF USMV attracted about $1.54 billion in assets.\n\nShort-Term Treasury Bonds Lost\n\niShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (ASX: ) and Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF BSV shed about $2.86 billion and $936.8 million in assets in the month.\n\nConsumer ETF Sheds Assets\n\nU.S. consumer confidence receded in September the maximum in nine months, thanks to escalating trade tensions. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (TSXV: ) lost about $522.0 million in assets.\n\nDow Jones Out of Favor\n\nThough the broader market initially rejoiced the prospective U.S.-China trade talks, the momentum slowed down at the end of the month. In a recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump urged nations to opt for nationalism and reject globalism. Trump also issued a message to China that he will not conform to any \u201cbad deal\u201d pertaining to trade negotiations. This hurt investors\u2019 confidence in SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE: ) ETF Trust (TSXV: ) , which lost about $534.2 million in assets.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
