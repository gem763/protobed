Reminder: There are 110 days until the Iowa caucuses and 384 days until the 2020 election.\n\nAt the end of the night, the same 12 candidates were standing at their lecterns as at the beginning, and it would be hard to say if many minds were changed by the Democratic primary debate Tuesday at Ohio\u2019s Otterbein University. But it did bring some differences among them into sharper focus, setting the stage for the next phase of the primary process, which will begin to see the field narrow down to the serious contenders as the candidates at the bottom drop out.\n\nThey will, trust us. Here\u2019s 2020 Vision\u2019s exclusive analysis of how the debate affected the prospects of all 19 Democratic candidates.\n\nTwelve candidates among those still running shared the stage Tuesday night for the fourth Democratic presidential debate, hosted by CNN and the New York Times at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.

Because that\u2019s how her rivals treated her. The Massachusetts senator faced near-constant attacks \u2014 on taxes from Beto O\u2019Rourke, on taking down President Trump\u2019s Twitter from Kamala Harris, on automation from Andrew Yang \u2014 and successfully parried most of them by pivoting, with her usual clarity and crispness, to broader themes. She even outmaneuvered Joe Biden in a back-and-forth about getting \u201cbig things\u201d done, citing her role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBut in the exchange that mattered most \u2014 a multicandidate pile-on about Medicare for All that took place in the beginning of the debate, when the most people were watching \u2014 Warren got scuffed up for the first time this year. By now it\u2019s clear that a) taxes would have to go up to pay for her health plan, and b) she will never say so, repeating only that it will \u201clower costs\u201d for the middle class. The calculation, presumably, is to avoid creating a perfect sound bite for Republican attack ads in the general election. Yet Warren has built her campaign on her reputation as a truth-telling nonpolitician, so being hammered by her opponents for not answering a simple yes or no question and then not answering a simple yes or no question, over and over again on live TV, had the unwanted effect of making her look like the very kind of politician she professes not to be.\n\nStill, Warren hit all of her favorite populist notes about how the \u201cwealthy and well-connected have captured our democracy.\u201d She contrasted the kind of \u201cvague campaign that nibbles around the edges\u201d (cough Joe Biden cough) with her \u201c50 plans\u201d and her signature pledge to \u201cdream big and fight hard.\u201d And she didn\u2019t make any mistakes substantial enough to slow her momentum, either nationally or in the early-state polling.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. (John Minchillo/AP) More\n\n2. Joe Biden \u2b07\ufe0f: Biden still leads in the national polls by 6 points. The Ukraine drama hasn\u2019t depressed his numbers. Much to his team\u2019s relief, it wasn\u2019t even a major topic Tuesday night. Nobody attacked Hunter. Asked whether he\u2019d made a mistake by allowing his son to do business in foreign countries while he was vice president, Biden insisted that neither of them had done anything wrong. Then everyone moved on.\n\nIt was a status quo debate for the former VP \u2014 at least until the very end. In response to a question about whether the party could beat Trump by moving to the left, Biden claimed that he was \u201cthe only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done\u201d \u2014 then, as if that didn\u2019t sound condescending enough, he seemed to take credit when Warren mentioned the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, her signature accomplishment. It was an exchange that struck many observers as high-handed and even sexist, and if cable news picks it up and plays it ad infinitum, it could turn into the bad moment that overshadows an otherwise decent debate.", "description": "It would be hard to say if many minds were changed by the Democratic primary debate Tuesday.
