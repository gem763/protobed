If one of them becomes the nominee, the Democrats have moved so far to the left in a direction way beyond [onetime Democratic presidential candidate George] McGovern, way beyond any of the liberals they previously nominated. I think they make it almost impossible for them to win a general election,\u201d he told Hemmer.\n\nFleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush from 2001-2003, also pointed to profound ideological divides between the party\u2019s moderate and progressive wings.\n\n\u201cYou saw that tension build at the beginning of the debate, where they spent about half an hour on Medicare-for-all. And, you heard Democrats like Biden and [Minnesota Senator Amy] Klobuchar are warning the rest of the field how dangerous an idea it is to go this far,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut, it\u2019s what Bernie wants, what Warren wants, [Juli\u00e1n] Castro wants\u2014many of the Democrats want it,\u201d said Fleischer.\n\nEarlier Friday morning on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., told viewers that the Democrats provided nothing to the American people: \u201cThey need people to be dependent on big government because if you\u2019re not, they really don\u2019t offer anything. We saw nothing new last night. We saw no plans and that\u2019s scary for them.\u201d\n\nFleischer agreed with the younger Trump\u2019s analysis because \u201cwhat you saw in the first two debates scared a lot of people in the middle and, of course, on the right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole Democratic agenda is putting the Democrats in jeopardy. And, that\u2019s a huge issue in a general election,\u201d Fleischer said.\n\nThe top three Democrats in the polls include Biden, Warren, and Sanders, whom Fleischer says is \u201cjust not cutting it this year.\u201d He also noted that Warren feels fresher to voters, although \u201cthey\u2019re ideologically very much the same.\u201d\n\nIndiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Senator Kamala Harris are following their lead, but not closely.\n\nThe candidates debated with polls showing a majority of voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction under President Donald Trump, but Democrats have seemingly yet to answer fundamental questions about who or what the party stands for beyond simply opposing the first-term Republican.\n\nWhen Hemmer asked if it was possible that there could be more than one candidate sent to the convention in Milwaukee next August, Fleischer told him it was still too soon to say. \u201cI still think you have three people at the top and basically nobody else matters for now. And, those three are Biden, Warren, and Sanders. That seems to be the shape of the race.\u201d", "description": "A liberal Democratic agenda is putting the party in danger of losing the 2020 presidential election, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/27/694940094001_6077919193001_6077930966001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
