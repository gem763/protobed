(Burak Kara/Getty Images)\n\nWith Turkey launching an invasion into Syria, as expected, President Trump just clarified his position on the matter: He\u2019s basically letting it happen.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance has been murky since Sunday, when the White House abruptly announced that the United States would clear the way for a Turkish incursion into Syria, without supporting it. During a conversation by phone, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told Trump he was finally sending in troops against Kurdish forces allied with the United States. In response, Trump reportedly told Erdogan he didn\u2019t support the move, but then got off the phone and startled some in his administration by issuing a statement essentially letting it proceed.\n\nNow, with Turkey launching its expected offensive against the Kurds, Trump has basically confirmed that this is the U.S. stance.\n\nIn a new statement, Trump said that the United States \u201cdoes not endorse\u201d the operation and has \u201cmade it clear\" that it\u2019s a \"bad idea.\u201d The president\u2019s statement added that Turkey had promised to avoid a humanitarian crisis and would be held \u201cresponsible\u201d for ensuring that all Islamic State fighters remain in prison.\n\nThat\u2019s a reference to fears that this decision could revive the Islamic State, because the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are holding thousands of ISIS fighters \u2014 and no one knows what will happen to those prisoners if the SDF is overrun by the Turkish military.\n\n\u201cWe continue to monitor the situation closely,\u201d Trump concluded. Translation: Go ahead, but don\u2019t make us look bad in the process.\n\nThere are all kinds of questions about how this decision was made. And House Democrats will hopefully try to answer them.\n\nDemocrats will examine the decision\n\nDuring an interview with this blog, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the committee would be examining Trump\u2019s decision, which Schiff described as \u201cimpulsive and dangerous.\u201d\n\nSchiff noted that the Intelligence Committee has regularly focused on the region, on the threat posed by ISIS, on the position there of U.S. troops and that of our Kurdish allies, and tensions involving Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe are briefed and receive reports on these subjects constantly, and we will be looking into what this latest decision by the president means, in terms of our national security and the likely consequences on the ground,\u201d Schiff told us, as well as whether it would mean \u201cfurther destabilization of the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be poring over the intelligence to determine what steps Congress might need to take to protect American interests in light of this reckless action by the president,\u201d Schiff continued, adding that this would be pursued \u201cas part of our oversight responsibility.\u201d\n\nWe now know that Turkey has begun a major offensive into northern Syria aimed at crushing the SDF, the Kurdish-led force that has been fighting ISIS in cooperation with the United States. While Turkey considers the Kurdish groups to be terrorists, the Kurds are long-standing allies who appear once again to have been sold out by a U.S. administration.\n\nWe also know this move came about in an unusual way. Typically a decision such as this \u2014 with potentially catastrophic consequences for a U.S. ally and unpredictable results throughout the region \u2014 would be extensively discussed within the national security and foreign policy apparatus first.\n\nBut this time, The Post reports, senior Pentagon officials were \u201cblindsided.\u201d One administration administration official said: \u201cTo say the military is very angry about this is an understatement.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the outraged response to it was unusually bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) declared that the move would \u201cabandon\u201d the Kurds to \u201cslaughter\u201d by the Turks and \u201ctaints our reputation all over the world.\u201d And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a stanch Trump ally, warned that ISIS would reemerge.\n\nWhat might oversight into this decision look like?\n\nJoshua Geltzer, a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council from 2015 to 2017, told us that congressional scrutiny could establish what, precisely, the intelligence told Trump the potential consequences of it might be (before he went ahead and did it anyway).\n\n\u201cIt would be useful to try to show that the U.S. government was witting that if allowed, Turkey was going to do exactly what it\u2019s doing today,\u201d Geltzer said. He added that the intelligence would likely show that ISIS \u201cis trying to reemerge, and that we need Syrian Kurds to remain our partners if we\u2019re going to prevent those gains from being made.\u201d\n\nOf course, recent events have suggested that the White House isn\u2019t going to make congressional oversight easy. But here\u2019s an area in which Republicans might also throw their weight behind such oversight.\n\n\u201cI have to think that the vehemence of the Republican reaction against this rash decision by the president reflects a growing level of anxiety among Republicans that the president\u2019s decision-making is becoming even more dangerously erratic,\u201d Schiff told us.\n\nTrump has tried to cast the move as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to end our \u201cforever wars\u201d in the Middle East. But what really drove his decision is cloudy indeed, and calls out for more explication.\n\nAnd even if Trump doesn\u2019t want to start a new war in the Middle East, that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t perfectly capable of creating a new catastrophe there.\n\nRead more:\n\nJosh Rogin: How Trump just destroyed his own Syria strategy\n\nDavid Ignatius: Trump has opened the door for an Islamic State resurgence in Syria\n\nFahrettin Altun: The world must support Turkey\u2019s plan for northeastern Syria\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s Syria decision reflects his stunning ignorance of the situation", "description": "The abrupt pullout from Syria raises a lot of questions.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Paul Waldman", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "October At Pm", "Greg Sargent Writes The Plum Line Blog.
