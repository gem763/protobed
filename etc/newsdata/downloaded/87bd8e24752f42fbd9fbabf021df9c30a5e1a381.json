South Africa is indeed creating better conditions for local business to flourish, but it is reforming slower than other economies.\u201d\n\nM\u00fagica said a reform in the area of enforcing contracts stood in South Africa\u2019s favour \u2013 the country improved the quality of its judicial administration by introducing the specialised court dedicated to hearing commercial cases.\n\n\u201cA more sophisticated and streamlined court structure led to an improved business environment in South Africa in the past year,\u201d she said.\n\nSouth Africa is ranked high (13th) when it comes to safeguarding minority investors. This means that minority investors are well protected from conflicts of interest and that shareholders\u2019 rights in corporate governance are properly guaranteed in South Africa.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nSouth Africa is lagging in the areas of trade facilitation and business incorporation.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa ranks 145th in trading across borders, and the study points out that Durban port handling charges are relatively expensive compared with neighbouring countries\u2019,\u201d said M\u00fagica.\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nOne area that desperately needs attention is in the ease of starting a new business, especially due to the country\u2019s high unemployment rate, which jumped to 29% in the second quarter of this year.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa ranks 139th in starting a business. While it is relatively inexpensive to open a company in South Africa, it still takes up to 40 days for an entrepreneur to start up and formally operate a business. This is almost twice the average in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d said M\u00fagica.", "description": "Even though South Africa is taking steps to improve the efficiency and quality of its business regulations, other countries in the world are reforming at a faster pace.", "authors": ["Avantika Seeth"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8536/a1311fc093b945a0b65f8c2f80568610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
