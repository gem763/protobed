Either it\u2019s a foul or it\u2019s not.\u2019\n\nDivock Origi was challenged by Victor Lindelof (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nFormer Liverpool player and manager Graeme Souness agreed that it was a foul on Origi and was perplexed as to why it wasn\u2019t given.\n\n\u2018I think Lindelof does catch him, he catches the inside of his left leg anyway you look at that, that\u2019s a foul,\u2019 said the Scot.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s definite contact with the player, it\u2019s a foul. He\u2019s been kicked, below his left knee.\n\n\u2018You kick someone from behind, it\u2019s a foul, it\u2019s not even up for discussion.\u2019\n\nLiverpool players were not impressed by the decision (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThere has been some criticism of the way in which VAR is implemented in the Premier League, with the on-field referee unable to look at incidents on a screen on the side of the pitch.\n\nInstead, the VAR official decides on whether the decision should be overturned from the remote location they are based.\n\nNeville believes it should be the referee, in Sunday\u2019s case Martin Atkinson, that should be able to review his own decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve backed themselves into a corner, they\u2019ve taken a position, they won\u2019t let the referee look at the screens in the dugout,\u2019 said Neville.\n\nCo-commentator Jamie Carragher added: \u2018They\u2019ve left themselves open to criticism. A foul\u2019s a foul.\u2019\n\nVAR worked in United\u2019s favour on another occasion on Sunday as a Sadio Mane goal was chalked off as the Senegalese star handled the ball before putting it past David de Gea.\n\nMORE: Manchester United fans love Marcus Rashford \u2018bullying\u2019 Virgil van Dijk during Liverpool clash\n\nMORE: Roy Keane \u2018disgusted\u2019 as Manchester United players hug Liverpool rivals in Old Trafford tunnel", "description": "Manchester United legend Gary Neville admitted that Marcus Rashford's goal against Liverpool on Sunday should not have stood.
