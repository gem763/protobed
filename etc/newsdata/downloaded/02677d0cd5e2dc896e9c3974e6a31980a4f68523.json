But this isn't the first time Isro has been hailed for its thrift. Its 2014 Mars mission cost $74m, a tenth of the budget for the American Maven orbiter.\n\nRead more about India's space ambitions", "description": "Chandrayaan-2 was about to land near the Moon's unexplored south pole when the link went down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6493/production/_107974752_mediaitem107973397.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
