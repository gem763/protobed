The attack happened on Wednesday, Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.\n\nStreaming live from a camera mounted on his helmet, he pushed on the doors of the synagogue, fired several shots at a lock on the door, stuck an explosive in a door jam and lit it but could not get in -- a fact that likely spared dozens of lives.\n\nWatching it unfold on the synagogue's security cameras were 51 people barricaded inside, Max Privorozky, the head of Halle's Jewish community, told CNN.\n\nAn image of the alleged synagogue shooter shared on social media.", "description": "A man has confessed to an attack near a German synagogue in which two people died.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis", "Sharon Braithwaite"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191009090927-05-germany-incident-1009-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
