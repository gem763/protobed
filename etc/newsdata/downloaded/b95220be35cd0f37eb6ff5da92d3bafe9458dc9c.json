Gatlin stopped taking medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after it led to the first drugs ban of his controversial career. The suspension was later overturned after his lawyers cited the Disabilities Act.\n\nThe verdict allowed Gatlin to win gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics but led to him having to contend with the symptoms of ADHD independently of the medication he had previously relied on to prevent his condition undermining his work and education.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Basketball icon Michael Jordan is another sports star to have thrived after learning he had the condition.\n\nGatlin\u2019s own diagnosis relates to what is described clinically as inattentiveness (rather than hyperactivity). He says he has never been able to overcome his impairment when it comes to focusing on \u201call the monotonous things\u201d involved in day-to-day preparation. However, the three-time world champion revealed to The Independent that he has come to see his condition as something that steels him from the pressure and spotlight of global finals, occasions which can overwhelm other athletes.\n\n\u201cADD sucks during training, but coming into finals I actually feel such an energy burst because when I step out on to the track, and I hear so much and I see so many people and my mind gets distracted, I kind of just feel at home actually. It\u2019s eerie but it makes me feel good there\u2019s so much going on.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrist Dr Dale Archer highlights a capacity reported by many of the patients he\u2019s seen with ADHD, that of achieving a laser-like focus when they arrive in particular situations that others find chaotic, in his book Better than Normal.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018hyper-focus\u2019 comes up often,\u201d Dr Archer says. \u201cThe problems associated with ADHD are well known [but] there are indeed positives. Many of these strengths translate well to sports. Athletes with ADHD tend to perform better in sports that require hyper focus: short and intense bursts of attention.\n\n\u201cThey can be in the moment, with a heightened awareness of their immediate environment. They excel in chaotic conditions and thrive under pressure.\u201d\n\nWhile Gatlin flourished on Saturday, back at the refurbished Khalifa Stadium in Doha where he once equalled the world 100m record, others complained about feeling preoccupied by the half-empty stadium, the weather conditions or their bodies not responding when they most needed them to.\n\n\u201cThe stadium not being full had an effect on the race,\u201d complained the South African Akani Simbine, who felt he underperformed in finishing fourth. \u201cI wanted to finish on the podium [but] the crowd makes a difference. It just felt like a Diamond League meet most of the time, not really like a world champs.\u201d\n\nTeam GB\u2019s Zharnel Hughes, who qualified third fastest for the final before taking sixth, could only reflect that his \u201cbody wasn\u2019t feeling up for it tonight unfortunately. When I pushed out I was all over the place and I lost my form and I\u2019m not happy.\u201d\n\nSome argue that because it can bring positives as well as challenges, ADHD should be recognised as neurodiversity rather than as an impairment, as it currently is in both US and UK law. Gatlin says that the limitations it brings should not be underestimated. \u201cSometimes you can block out a lot of things because you\u2019re thinking about so much and you can distract yourself, but sometimes that distraction of being ADD can really set you back.\u201d\n\nMaking seemingly careless mistakes in conversation is another symptom of ADHD and Gatlin slips in referring to a \u2018Keni Harris\u2019 \u2013 rather than the sprint hurdles world record holder Keni Harrison \u2013 when he name-checks a teammate in the US squad in Doha, who he says shares the same diagnosis, during our interview.\n\nGatlin also make mention more than once of a \u2018Christopher\u2019 \u2013 rather than Christian \u2013\u00ad Coleman after their showdown in the desert nation. Coleman, who competed for the same University of Tennessee college as Gatlin, has forged a growing bond with his compatriot since turning professional two years ago.\n\n\u201cNobody sees what goes on behind closed doors to work so hard, to make it to this point,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cYou can never count Justin out. He\u2019s a great guy and a great competitor, especially at his age. I knew he was going to make it to that final and I knew he was going to compete.\u201d\n\nColeman\u2019s empathy with Gatlin may grow. The younger American is discovering what it feels like to be associated with doping controversies having recently avoided a suspension for missing three drug tests on a technicality.\n\nCritics such as the former double Olympic champion Michael Johnson say the pair only have themselves to blame for how they are perceived. Gatlin maintains that his second violation \u2013 he tested positive for testosterone in 2006 \u2013 was caused by a steroid cream being applied by a member of his team without his knowledge. A vow to be more careful with who he associated with followed but earlier this week Gatlin was reportedly spotted with disgraced former athletics coach Dennis Mitchell.\n\nRightly or wrong Gatlin may feel misunderstood for long as his career endures. But he feels he now understand himself better than he ever has.\n\nThe next challenge for the sprinter is the 4x100m relay in Qatar next weekend. 2020 brings a world indoor championships in China and an Olympic Games in Japan. Seize each opportunity and Gatlin will end his career not only as male sprinting\u2019s most divisive athlete, but he\u2019ll overtake Usain Bolt to become its most decorated.", "description": "The controversial sprinter Justin Gatlin says his sustained ability to rise to the occasion in major athletics events is partly attributable to the neurological condition he was diagnosed with as a child and still wrestles with as an adult.", "authors": ["Barney Cullum"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/07/gettyimages-1164253170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
