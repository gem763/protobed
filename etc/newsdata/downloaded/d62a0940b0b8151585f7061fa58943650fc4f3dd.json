The time was scheduled so Perry could get a photo of his new grandchild with Trump, according to two other people, who asked not to be named to discuss a matter that is not yet public.\n\nPerry\u2019s plan to depart comes amid scrutiny of his role in the White House\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, although he had been planning his departure from the agency well before the issue became the subject of an impeachment query by House Democrats.\n\nPerry is said to have a good rapport with Trump having avoided the missteps that led to the downfall of Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, his now departed colleagues who led the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department respectively.\n\nPerry, 69, has served since March 2017 as the leader of the agency he once vowed to eliminate. With an annual budget of around $30 billion, it is responsible for work ranging from safe-guarding nuclear weapons to maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nHe has told friends he\u2019d like to pursue opportunities in the private sector.\n\nFor months, Perry has been paving the way for his likely successor, Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, according to a person familiar with the matter. Brouillette has taken a bigger role in some department policy matters, such as natural gas exports, and he has more frequently served as the public face of the agency, including on diplomatic missions to tout American energy to foreign allies.\n\nKey Perry aides also recently departed the agency as the secretary prepares to leave.\n\nDuring his tenure, Perry championed the national laboratory system and other department programs that the Trump administration sought to cut, and he tried unsuccessfully to rescue unprofitable coal and nuclear plants.\n\nRumors of Perry departing the agency have popped up before -- Trump is said to have considered him to lead both the Department of Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs. Both times Perry or aides to him have asserted he was happy in his position at energy and had no desire to leave.\n\nStill, Perry has not been a seamless fit with the Energy Department, where the two most recent secretaries had PhDs in physics. Perry was an animal science major at Texas A&M, and he advocated abolishing the department during his own presidential bid.\n\n\u201cWhile the beltway media has breathlessly reported on rumors of Secretary Perry\u2019s departure for months, he is still the Secretary of Energy and a proud member of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet. One day the media will be right. Today is not that day,\u201d said Shaylyn Hynes, an Energy Department spokeswoman.\n\nPerry\u2019s departure was earlier reported by Politico.\n\n(Updates with information about likely successor in seventh paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer A.
