We are working with urgency to remove this content and permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act.\"\n\nThe suspected gunman has been detained, according to local law enforcement officials.\n\nThe shooting occurred on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur while numerous synagogues are on high alert due to an increase in high-profile incidents of anti-Semitic violence.\n\nThe shooting being streamed to the public on Twitch, which is primarily used to stream video games, illustrates a growing problem for social media companies.\n\nEarlier this year, a gunman livestreamed himself killing 51 worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Facebook.\n\nTech companies scrambled to remove the 17-minute video, but copies remained available for hours on many platforms.\n\nIn the aftermath of that attack, several prominent websites committed new resources to curbing terrorist and extremist content.\n\nSeventeen nations have signed the so-called Christchurch Call, a nonbinding pledge to crack down on extremist or violent content online. Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also signed on to the agreement.\n\nThe Trump administration has declined to join the agreement, citing concerns about freedom of speech.", "description": "The shooting near a synagogue\u00a0in Halle, Germany, on Wednesday that left two dead was livestreamed on Twitch, the company\u00a0confirmed to\u00a0The Hill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/twitch_101919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
