BAU stands for business-as-usual. \u201cIt is hard to know what weather outcomes will occur. Econometric estimates are based on small deviations in the mean of the probability distribution.\u201d\n\nMackie and Murray said business-as-usual studies didn\u2019t generally provide the kind of numbers that would motivate governments to take costly climate-mitigation policies now.\n\nThey referenced research including an August 2019 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which suggested that a persistent rise in average global temperature of 0.04 degrees celsius annually would hit world gross domestic product per capita by 7.22% by 2100.\n\nGiven that incomes would likely be much larger than today by 2100, that magnitude of damage is \u201ctrivial,\u201d the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) economists wrote. Assuming a $100 level of income today and 2% GDP per capita gains until 2100, it would be the difference between $487 and $453, they illustrated.\n\nWhen Is Change a \u2018Crisis\u2019? Why Climate Terms Matter: QuickTake\n\n\u201cGiven that wealth is likely to grow over the coming 80 years, even sizable losses in wealth still leave future generations wealthier than the current generation,\u201d Mackie and Murray wrote. \u201cThis raises the question of whether it will be possible for governments to push through difficult climate policies on the basis of counterfactual losses.\u201d\n\nBut all of that analysis may be deficient, they indicated.\n\n\u201cThe economics of climate change is really in the tails of the probability distribution, and in the risk of disastrous outcomes,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRead here about the IMF\u2019s most emphatic statement on climate change yet.", "description": "JPMorgan Economists Warn of Black Swan Risks From Climate Change", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic838eb7235e84688e0758fcafdad1c901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
