Photo: Getty Images\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper is many things. He\u2019s a TV man, a person who says words in public. He owns multiple suits. He is overly concerned about people being mean to him on Twitter. That last point is relevant because Tapper has put aside his fear of getting mildly criticized in a public forum in order to flex his art skills by drawing today\u2019s \u201cDilbert.\u201d The text of the comic was, as ever, written by nth-dimensional-chess genius Scott \u201cthe Brain\u201d Adams, and the original will be auctioned off to benefit a veterans\u2019 charity.\n\n\u201cDilbert\u201d is a daily comic strip that appears in newspapers, which are, if memory serves, inexpensive daily publications that offer information and commentary regarding recent events. The title character is an office worker who deals with arduous and arcane corporate bureaucracy as well as managerial incompetence. Dilbert\u2019s struggles are very familiar to many people over the age of 50; they are unrecognizable to everyone under the age of 30, all of whom work from their cars and whose \u201cboss\u201d is an app that tells them where the next delivery drop-off or rideshare customer is located. Still, \u201cDilbert\u201d remains an indelible portrait of yesteryear\u2019s office culture. Anyway, here\u2019s Tapper\u2019s take on Dilbert.\n\nVad har h\u00e4nt med Dilbert? pic.twitter.com/goBif6Ltfj \u2014 Nikke Lindqvist \ud83d\udda4 (@nikkelin) September 23, 2019\n\nIf you also find yourself wondering \u201cVad har h\u00e4nt med Dilbert?\u201d this morning, the answer is @ScottAdamsSays asked me to guest draw the strip this week; we\u2019re auctioning off the originals for the Veterans Day @eBay auction to benefit @HomesForOurTrps! https://t.co/wwpvUf2IUW \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 23, 2019\n\nJudging from the the 200-plus comments left on today\u2019s strip, \u201cDilbert\u201d acolytes are not happy. Tapper\u2019s more detailed art style is unsettling, revealing the texture of Dilbert\u2019s nostrils, the unnatural design of the flesh-color lumps on his head. Pointy-Haired Boss is no longer a beady-eyed dope but now bears the menacing visage of Oswald Cobblepot.\n\nEvery single \u201cDilbert\u201d strip on the site has an individual comments section and allows users to rate it on a five-star scale. Tapper\u2019s has an average of three stars right now, which is respectable until you notice that every other \u201cDilbert\u201d comic this month is rated at four and a half stars. Devastating.\n\n\u201cI need three more cups of coffee just to burn my eyes so I can forget this drawing,\u201d writes a user with the handle \u201cLithuanian Survivor.\u201d Dilbert-heads gotta have their java. Many subsequent comments echo this sentiment. \u201cPlease don\u2019t draw Dilbert like that,\u201d one pleads. \u201cI am not drunk enough to look at this,\u201d adds another.\n\nAnother notes that Tapper shouldn\u2019t quit his day job, which is a fun burn except for the fact that Tapper also draws cartoons for CNN. In exchange for performing his normal State of the Union duties for the network, he is allowed to produce 2005-era Flash animations and air them for his audience in a segment called \u201cState of the Cartoon-ion.\u201d For instance, what if Sean Spicer did \u201cGangnam Style\u201d?\n\nStill, some readers appreciate the fan service Tapper has included in his Dilbert. For one thing, the tie is back! \u201cNostrils on Dilbert are a bit unsettling, but I like the style and I\u2019ve really missed that tie,\u201d a commenter notes. Back in 2014, as we all remember, Dilbert switched to more casual workplace attire, discarding his button-down and curvy tie for a polo and a lanyard. Seemingly unable to resist the call of drawing a canonical Dilbert tie, Tapper has added it back. And I\u2019m living for it.", "description": "The CNN anchor drew the office drone in a more realistic, unsettling style that has fans livid and irate.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/23/23-jake-tapper-dilbert.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
