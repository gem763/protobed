Who among us has not beamed with schadenfreude when a politician we loathe\u2014or an inconsequential figure who has attracted our wrath for reasons principled or petty\u2014has suffered his 15 minutes of public humiliation? Many a ratioed tweet is simply inane. And certainly widespread disapprobation is warranted in response to, say, hatred or bigotry, evident lies or obfuscations, and attempts to bully the weak.\n\nBut though I am hardly immune to the joys of a deserved ratio, I am worried about the kinds of incentives we put in place\u2014and the kind of public culture we are creating\u2014by equating the expression of unpopular opinion with failure.\n\nUnless we believe ourselves to be the first generation in history to have discovered all of the correct opinions, we must stay alive to the possibility that plenty of arguments that are deeply unpopular today deserve to be aired\u2014and perhaps even believed.\n\nSeen from this angle, the ratioed tweet\u2014or, for that matter, the widely panned op-ed\u2014can claim a proud inheritance: that of the banned book, of the argument made before its time. If Socrates or Jesus or Copernicus had been able (and sufficiently imprudent) to tweet out their opinions, their contemporaries would almost certainly have administered a ratio. So it is possible that at least a small share of the tweets that are ratioed today express opinions we shall one day come to see as gospel.\n\nRead: Twitter needs a pause button\n\nConversely, all those social-media users who never get ratioed should consider the possibility that they have nothing to brag about: They daily demonstrate a remarkable ability to move with the crowd. Perhaps they genuinely hold the same views as a majority of their followers at all times. Or perhaps they merely combine a strong sense of the way the wind is blowing with a consistent willingness to censor themselves whenever their opinions are less than fashionable. But does any writer whose talents are limited to synthesizing conventional wisdom deserve our admiration? And should we trust any politician\u2014or, for that matter, any social-media personality\u2014who has the determination and self-discipline to hide from view any thought that might prove unpopular?\n\nA ratioed tweet is not an automatic indication of a serious failing that should make us doubt the author\u2019s judgment; it might just be a mark of courage and integrity. Instead of quickly making fun of anybody who has suffered the misfortune of getting ratioed, we should wonder, instead, if we should applaud their willingness to take a metaphorical beating for sharing their convictions. If we want to have meaningful debates, online or off, it is incumbent on all of us to exonerate the ratioed tweet\u2014or at least to pause before we condemn its author.", "description": "Among the extremely online, getting ratioed is considered an unambiguous sign of intellectual failure.", "authors": ["Yascha Mounk", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX70LNE/facebook.jpg?1571422750", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
