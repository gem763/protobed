Now team owner Robert Kraft must pay his way out of it.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the consensus of five league sources who spoke to Yahoo Sports this week \u2014 each familiar with Brown\u2019s now-voided Patriots deal and all having extensive experience with the overlap between NFL contracts and the league\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement. The group universally expressed the belief that New England\u2019s payout to Brown will likely happen deep into the 2020 calendar, after an exhaustive arbitration grievance that could ultimately reveal what Brown and his agents knew about a threatened sexual assault civil lawsuit prior to signing with the Patriots.\n\n\n\nOne key takeaway was heavily underscored by the group: The Patriots cut Brown before he triggered any signing bonus void as described in the CBA. And that will end up being the foundational and winning point of a forthcoming grievance from Brown and the NFL Players Association.\n\n\n\nAs one source put it, \u201c[New England] fighting to keep that signing bonus now is either a gross misunderstanding of [the CBA\u2019s] rules on voiding signing bonuses or it\u2019s just out of spite. I can\u2019t believe they don\u2019t understand the signing bonus voids in the CBA. There\u2019s just no way. This is just spitefulness. They\u2019re fighting [Brown] completely out of the anger and embarrassment in ownership.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown's appearance for the Patriots against the Dolphins might prove beneficial for him in a grievance against New England. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhy Patriots will be forced to pay Brown\u2019s signing bonus\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere it concerns Brown\u2019s $9 million signing bonus, the fight appears to be heading to an argument of one clause in the CBA. Specifically, Article 4 and section 9, which lays the foundation of the forfeitable breach of money within a contract. It states:\n\n\n\n(a) Forfeitable Breach. Any player who (i) willfully fails to report, practice or play with the result that the player\u2019s ability to fully participate and contribute to the team is substantially undermined (for example, without limitation, holding out or leaving the squad absent a showing of extreme personal hardship); or (ii) is unavailable to the team due to conduct by him that results in his incarceration; or (iii) is unavailable to the team due to a nonfootball injury that resulted from a material breach of Paragraph 3 of his NFL Player Contract; or (iv) voluntarily retires ...\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, the CBA language is stating that Brown could have forfeited his signing bonus if he did one of four things:\n\nRefused to report, practice or play and thus inhibited his ability to help the team.\n\nBecame unavailable due to behavior that resulted in his incarceration.\n\nBecame unavailable due to what his player contract designated as a non-football injury.\n\nVoluntarily retired.\n\nThe problem for the Patriots is Brown didn\u2019t fit under any of those qualifiers prior to his release, which in the eyes of the union (and the other league sources familiar with his deal) equates to the Patriots still being on the hook for his signing bonus. Therein lies the only kicker that matters: Regardless of what the Patriots put into their contract with Brown when it comes to voiding his signing bonus, arbitrators have consistently ruled that CBA language supersedes team language when it comes to player contracts. And the CBA says Brown had to have fallen into one of the four aforementioned categories to lose his signing bonus. No matter what the Patriots inserted into their deal with Brown, the CBA\u2019s four designations were all that would matter when it came to the signing bonus.\n\nInterestingly, sources who spoke with Yahoo say New England had one arguable contract \u201cout\u201d when it came to Brown and surrendered it: that he and his representation didn\u2019t make the team aware of his civil suit. Essentially, the Patriots could have used that withholding of information as a means to void his entire deal. But New England negated any claim to that by playing Brown against the Miami Dolphins after the lawsuit was filed in federal court.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how]\n\n\u201cIf they had cut [Brown] as soon as they became aware of the civil suit, then there\u2019s the argument of the [withholding] breach undermining the entire agreement,\u201d one source told Yahoo Sports. \u201cBut they kept him on the roster after that lawsuit was filed. They played him in a game. They even paid him checks for [two weeks of] work. If the civil suit was a true dealbreaker, the Patriots could have shown it by breaking the deal. Their actions speak to their intent and their intent was shown when they continued to pay him after the civil suit.\u201d\n\nAnother source pinned the onus on the Patriots for not doing a deal containing weekly protections.\n\n\u201cThey did the contract structure, knowing how difficult [the CBA] makes it to withhold or claw back a signing bonus,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf they wanted more protection, that was their option when they negotiated the deal. They could have protected themselves by making the deal a series of per-game 53-man roster bonuses. The signing bonus route is an instantly recognized chunk of earned money as soon as he signs. It\u2019s the most player-friendly route you can take.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots did a bad contract with Brown\n\nDid New England do a bad deal in the team\u2019s rush to get Brown under contract? And if it was willing to give Brown so much money in a signing bonus that would be difficult to negate, did it do enough background work to warrant such confidence?\n\nTo the former, yes, it\u2019s clear now that New England did a bad contract structure given what has transpired and the lack of protection that now exists. Whether or not the Patriots did enough homework is a matter of argument, although the team didn\u2019t do enough to protect itself from the possibility that Brown and his agents might not be telling the team everything it needed to know.\n\nWhy either of those things materialized \u2014 a poor contract structure and a lack of knowledge about Brown\u2019s problems \u2014 will remain a matter of argument. Some of it likely has to do with Brown\u2019s talent making him a pursued commodity from the moment he was released by the Oakland Raiders. It\u2019s very possible the Patriots moved too fast and offered too friendly a contract out of fear of losing Brown.\n\nSaid one prominent agent who has negotiated multiple deals with New England: \u201cThey\u2019re so ultra-competitive they were afraid they were going to lose out to another team if they didn\u2019t give them that structure. And they figured they could control the kid \u2014 which they probably could. What they didn\u2019t see coming was that other [stuff] and that\u2019s what drove [them] crazy.\u201d\n\nA few months from now, it\u2019s also what will cost the Patriots because there\u2019s no denying that part of this mess: New England dug a hole when it failed to properly protect itself. Now it\u2019s going to have to pay that $9 million signing bonus as it climbs out. Whether Bob Kraft likes it or not.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "It\u2019s clear now that New England did a bad contract structure given what has transpired and the lack of protection that now exists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RUOLUz.mm8tktYS1jlP_gg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZTm12_ZmTlNTuEr7GprAsw--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/10dfe790-e0c1-11e9-afbe-4695f3308773", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
