It was a very difficult decision to make, but we ultimately decided to go in a different direction,\" de Guzman said Wednesday in a statement.\n\n\"I would like to thank Nikola for his commitment to Fury FC and wish him success and good luck in his future endeavours.\"\n\nThe team missed the playoffs in Popovic's first season. This year they made the Eastern Conference play-in, but a tie with the Charleston Battery wasn't enough to move forward.\n\nThe club said it would announce the next steps regarding the process of finding a new head coach in the future.", "description": "The Ottawa Fury will have a new sideline boss next season\u00a0as the club elected not to renew the well-travelled coach's contract.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4862267.1539473216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nikola-popovic-ottawa-fury-fc-coach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
