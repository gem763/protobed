Given the size of the alleged tax evasion prosecutors were obligated to open an investigation, the source said.\n\nNo Netflix executive is under investigation because the probe is still at a preliminary stage, the source said.\n\nMilan prosecutors in the past have probed other U.S. tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) for dodging taxes, allowing Italy to net several billion euros in fines and tax payments.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to obtain a comment from Netflix.", "description": "Italy prosecutors open Netflix tax evasion investigation: source", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF920I1_L.jpg"}
