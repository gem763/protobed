INN members employ nearly 2,000 journalists; there are an estimated 100 more such sites that aren\u2019t members of the trade group, said Sue Cross, the institute\u2019s executive director.\n\nAt a time when newspapers are closing and cutting back staff, the organizations are the landing spot for more of the nation\u2019s public service and investigative journalism.\n\nLast year, these sites received 43% of their funding from foundations and 39% from individuals, with advertising and events accounting for the rest, the institute said. Individual donors accounted for a quarter of the funding in 2011, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very heartening development,\u201d Cross said.\n\nWith many questioning whether people will pay to support online journalism, the numbers indicate more people recognize the industry needs to be supported, she said.\n\nMost of her calls a few years ago used to be from journalists looking for work, Cross said. Now she\u2019s hearing from more business people, concerned citizens and even politicians wondering what can be done to support journalism.\n\nWhile the percentage of overall foundation giving may be going down, the amount of money being put in is still increasing, particularly for supporting journalism on specific issues like the environment and social justice, the report said.\n\nForty-two percent of nonprofit news organizations describe their mission as investigative journalism, and 78% employ at least one reporter who specializes in such digging, the report said. Thirty-nine percent describe their role as explanatory journalism or analysis.\n\nAbout half of the sites distribute their product themselves, with 29% relying mostly on third parties like newspapers. The rest rely on a mix.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nonprofit news organizations, a growth area in the troubled field of journalism, are broadening their base of support to take in almost as much from individual donors as they do from foundations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
