West asked. \u201cThe most racist thing a person could tell me is that I\u2019m supposed to choose something based on my race.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cI Love It\u201d artist reiterated some of his previously-held positions \u2014 specifically that the Democrat Party has maintained a hold on minority voters\u2019 mentality.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re brainwashed out here bro, Come on man. This is a free man talking. Democrats had us voting for Democrats with food stamps for years. What are you talking about guns in the 80s, taking the father\u2019s out the home, Plan B, lowering our votes, making us abort children,\u201d the hip hop superstar said.\n\nHe also defended the conservative values of Christians across the nation, adding that those who push canceled culture are the same people who want to \u201cremove Jesus, period, from America\u201d altogether.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been canceled before. That was canceled culture. Who told you that my career would be over? The same people that are telling you that you can\u2019t have a right to say who you will vote for,\u201d West said. \u201cThose people will be soon to take Jesus out of school. Those people will be soon to remove Jesus, period, from America, which is the Bible Belt. Those people will be so mad. Come on man.\u201d", "description": "Kanye West said the\u00a0\"most racist thing\" a person could do is \"tell me is that I'm supposed to choose something based on my race.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kanyeonbigboy1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
