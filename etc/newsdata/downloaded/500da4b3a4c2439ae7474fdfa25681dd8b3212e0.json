Rand Paul (R-KY) that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is not a socialist, but rather a \"murderous thug\" who starves his own people.\n\nNavarro asked Paul on Friday if it is fair for Republicans to say that if Americans vote for Democrats, then the country will devolve into socialism.\n\n\"Let me ask you this because I live in Miami, and there are Venezuelan exiles living there. You talk about Venezuela in your new book. I get a lot of political ads from the Republican Party. Donald Trump has tweeted this. Many have tweeted this. If you vote for Democrats, they will turn the United States into Venezuela. Do you think that\u2019s a fair statement to make?\" Navarro asked.\n\n\"Well, if you vote for a socialist, you might get socialism,\" Paul replied.\n\n\"Come on. Don\u2019t do that. Maduro is not a socialist. He\u2019s a corrupt, murderous thug who is starving his people,\" Navarro shot back.\n\nWhen Paul said it is not true that \"Maduro is not a socialist,\" Navarro became defensive and asked, \"That\u2019s not true? Maduro is not a thug and murderer who is starving his people? It\u2019s not socialism.\"\n\nPaul then tried to explain he was referring to her comment about him not being a socialist.\n\n\"No, I can\u2019t let you finish. If you are going to say Maduro is not a murderous thug, that\u2019s a damn lie. And I've got a bunch of neighbors and friends who know this. Don\u2019t do this to me. Don\u2019t mansplain. I\u2019m 47 years old,\" Navarro said.\n\nMaduro belongs to the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.", "description": ".10/11/2019 15:44:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/284/0bf1510a-1bbd-4e80-9a06-bd7dcffcd6b8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
