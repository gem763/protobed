Stay tuned!", "language": "en", "text": "In the supporting role is the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, who is also frequently referred to by his first name. He is plodding, possessed of antique leftist notions and yet, by virtue of extreme fecklessness and unpredictability, useful for generating that gripping sense that anything might happen.\n\nAD\n\nEvery day, surrogates and pundits appear on BBC Radio\u2019s marvelous news shows. \u201cBoris has promised this . . . \u201d \u201cJeremy has made it clear that . . . \u201d Cue hysterical giggles from listeners at home, who know that Boris Johnson\u2019s promises are for naught and that Jeremy is never clear on anything.\n\nAD\n\nIn Season One of the Brexit drama, a sensible prime minister, Theresa May, negotiated a Brexit deal that Boris and his buddies scuppered. It was a bad deal, to be sure, but the exquisite tragedy of May was that the deal was also the best one possible. By keeping Britain in the European customs union, it avoided introducing destabilizing border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. By enabling just-in-time delivery of auto parts, the deal also avoided throttling Britain\u2019s car industry. It was far less good than remaining in the European Union, but May\u2019s deal was respectable.\n\nNo matter. The Brexity right wing of the ruling Conservative Party wants out of the European customs union. They have a witty rationale for this: They wish to exit the deepest trade deal in the world so that they can negotiate less good ones. Up is down, more is less, and the Ministry of Truth does propaganda. Anyway, the right defenestrated May and installed Boris.\n\nAD\n\nNow, in Season Two, the plot thickens. Boris arrives in office with a bang. A neighbor records him and his lover in a shouting match. There are press stories about an apparent ex-lover. To silence his opponents, he hoodwinks the queen into illegally suspending Parliament, but then the courts slap him down. He loses his majority in Parliament. Even his brother-cum-campaign manager deserts him.\n\nAD\n\nBut don\u2019t count Boris out. Having earlier ruled out the idea of customs checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain \u2014 akin to checks between Hawaii and California \u2014 the prime minister performs a deft double back flip and lands in the opposite position. The European Union, which Boris and his ilk portray as ruthlessly implacable, quickly accepts. Customs inspections within the United Kingdom become the center plank of a new Brexit deal: so much for Brexiteer talk about putting the \u201cGreat\u201d back into Great Britain. Then, unlike the hapless May, Boris wins a majority for his deal in Parliament.\n\nOf course, the story isn\u2019t done yet. While approving Boris\u2019s deal, Parliament rejects his accelerated timetable for passing it. Ever the statesman, Boris throws his toys out of the crib and demands an election. Again, note the brilliant flash of humor here. Boris is proposing complex legislation that will affect Britain for a generation or more. But only if it can be jammed through Parliament in three days. Very Monty Python.\n\nAD\n\nUp next, the Jeremy factor. In the three years since the Brexit referendum, the Labour leader has contrived to avoid taking a position on the biggest political debate in memory. Cheekily, he got into politics without any intention of taking political positions, except when it comes to standing up for leftist thugs who hate American imperialism. Two-thirds of Britons tell pollsters that Labour\u2019s position on Brexit is \u201ca mystery to me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the question of Boris\u2019s desired election, Jeremy is masterfully inscrutable. He wants one, of course, because red-blooded opposition parties are always hungry for a shot at office. He fears one, naturally, because polls show that his schemes to nationalize industry, plus his squirming on Brexit, have combined to alienate voters. Fully 71 percent of respondents in one poll said he was doing a bad job. Only 16 percent approved of him.\n\nSo where does the plot go next? Will Jeremy agree to Boris\u2019s call for a vote, or will he do a sphinx on him? And will those perfidious Europeans continue to show bottomless patience and keep extending Britain\u2019s deadline? Boris might yet betray another of his supposed principles, and Jeremy might set a new land record for sitting on fences. Tune in for the next episode!\n\nOh, just one thing. This is not just television.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The drama would be entertaining if it wasn\u2019t real life.", "authors": ["Sebastian Mallaby", "Contributing Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wCRDLlKn-TOr1SnuBgylFEpUV9M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VPNDRSHVYQI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
