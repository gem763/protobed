The judge in his case did not appear to be impressed:\n\nAvenatti has now formally blamed his opposition to Trump for separate indictments in California and New York, where he is accused of defrauding Stormy Daniels and extorting Nike. Steward told U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts today that both cases are vindictive. \u201cVindictive?\u201d Batts asked, incredulously. Appearing taken aback, Batts added later: \u201cThis office is not known for being vindictive.\u201d\u2026 Steward suggested times have changed during the tenure of U.S. Attorney General William Barr, whom he called a \u201clapdog\u201d for Trump. \u201cThat may be,\u201d Batts replied, before questioning what Barr had to do with the case\u2026 Calling Avenatti\u2019s vindictive prosecution claims \u201cfrivolous,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman predicted that the pending claims would fail in both courts.\n\nAfter the hearing, Avenatti apparently held an impromptu press conference:\n\nAfter the hearing, Avenatti said he was in the fight of his life while \u201cthe biggest criminal occupies the White House.\u201d \u201cWelcome to Russia!\u201d he said.\n\nOkay, champ, maybe dial it back a little. I get that a lot of people hate Trump but does Avenatti really think they\u2019ll believe absolutely anything he says, so long as it sounds nefarious? That seems to be the guiding principle of his defense. I guess you can\u2019t blame him given that this same approach was a goldmine for him at CNN.\n\nJudge Batts doesn\u2019t seem to be taking the bait. She scheduled the trial for April. But first, Avenatti has to face the music in the Nike extortion case which starts next month. Also, last month a judge in California set his trial there for May. So Avenatti is going to be a very busy defendant for the next seven months.
