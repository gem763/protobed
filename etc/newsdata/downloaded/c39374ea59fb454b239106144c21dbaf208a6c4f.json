Bush.\n\n\u201cDHS has stepped up to its cyber capabilities, but we have much more to do in this area. Our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, its utility grids election systems and our public and private networks all are vulnerable,\u201d said Ms. Napolitano, who led the agency from 2009 through 2013 under former President Barack Obama. \u201cWe need a whole of government and a whole of public and private sector response to this threat, and it needs to happen now.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson, Ms. Napolitano\u2019s successor, said that he was disappointed that not more private-sector entities had partnered with DHS for information sharing purposes when he left the agency in early 2017, and he suggested to senators that they explore ways to encourage greater cooperation.\n\n\u201cI think the single best thing anyone can do in that situation is to raise the level of awareness about security among the people who use the system,\u201d said Mr. Johnson.\n\nMr. Johnson also indicated that he was disappointed in the response taken by President Trump\u2019s administration for cyberattacks attributed to the Russian government, adding that be believes other actions are needed to deter future attacks.\n\n\u201cI believe that you cannot create a complete line of defense against these kinds of attacks, therefore we have to put it to the bad actor and simply make the behavior cost-prohibitive,\u201d testified Mr. Johnson.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of good things have been done in this administration in terms of sanctions directed at Russians, the Russian government, and by the Congress, but if you believe the intelligence assessments, a lot more is necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nDHS spokespeople did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nThe field hearing was held at National September 11 Memorial Museum in Manhattan and focused on how DHS has adapted to handle evolving threats in the 18 years since the terrorist attacks spurred the agency\u2019s creation.\n\nResponding to questioning from Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, Ms. Napolitano proposed countering ever-evolving cybersecurity threats by first establishing a commission to draft a report like the one created after 9/11.\n\n\u201cThe report points out all these red flags that had arisen, and they said that a key critique is that our government leaders suffered from a failure of imagination,\u201d recalled Ms. Napolitano. \u201cIn the cyber arena, we have all these red flags now, we should not entertain such a failure of imagination. And perhaps it is time for the country to have a 9-11 Commission for cyber before we have, for example, massive ransomware attacks, simultaneously conducted around the country. Or where we suffer once again a direct attack on our democracy as we saw in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
