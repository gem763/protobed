The badge was given to YouTube channels with more than 100,000 subscribers.\n\nBut the company said it had become an endorsement of content rather than just an ID check and was in need of reform.\n\nAuthority and longevity\n\nUnder the change, only \"prominent channels that have a clear need for proof of authenticity\" would be verified, while many others would lose the mark.\n\nThe threatened removal prompted widespread protests by established YouTubers, many of whom said the verification mark helped them establish their authority and longevity on the site.\n\nBut on 20 September, YouTube announced it was largely reversing the changes it had proposed.\n\n\"We heard loud and clear how much the badge means to you,\" it said in a blog.\n\nAll those channels that currently have the verification badge will keep them, but in future badges will not automatically be bestowed on channels that cross the 100,000-subscriber mark.\n\nOnly those that need a guarantee of their identity, because they represent a brand or entity that is in danger of widespread impersonation, will be eligible.", "description": "The video-sharing site apologised after proposing a change that drew criticism from prominent YouTubers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/201A/production/_108881280_yt-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
