It cultivates, nurtures and feeds the creative and offers the world\u2019s biggest and most varied audiences. But the road to your chosen stage or limelight is not easy, and certainly not for the faint of heart.\u201d\n\nThese are the words of Alexandra Laliberte, the young founder of Actors Hour, a showcase for performers hosted at venues throughout New York. Actors Hour, which Laliberte started in 2018, has recently come under fire for welcoming Harvey Weinstein. Yes, that Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct, including rape, by multiple women\u2014mostly current and former actors\u2014and is currently awaiting trial for five charges of rape, sexual assault, and \u201cpredatory sexual assault,\u201d to which he has pleaded not guilty. The trial will begin on Jan. 6.\n\nIn the meantime, Weinstein has found himself, not once, but twice, at Actors Hour events. The most recent instance occurred at Downtime Bar in the East Village on Oct. 23. According to comedian and actor Amber Rollo, who was present at the event and tweeted about it, a person in attendance began protesting Weinstein\u2019s presence at the show\u2019s intermission, directly confronting him. \u201c[They were] shouting and crying and seemed to be the only sane person there. [THEY were] kicked out,\u201d Rollo tweeted. This person has been revealed to be Zoe Stuckless, a 21-year-old actor and playwright (Stuckless uses they/them pronouns). Stuckless told BuzzFeed that a man escorted them out of the event, repeating \u201cdue process, due process.\u201d\n\nComedian Kelly Bachman, a friend of Rollo\u2019s, used part of her set to address \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d and received heckles in turn. \u201cJust a general fuck you to the Freddy Krueger in the room,\u201d she continued on. At the previous Actors Hour event Weinstein showed up to on Sept. 30 in the Lower East Side, comedian Ricky Brown quipped, \u201cHey, is that Harvey Weinstein? Hi Harvey, I read that you raped a bunch of women.\u201d According to an attendee, Brown was \u201cchastised by the hosts\u201d for souring the mood.\n\nAfter the Downtime incident, Laliberte posted an apology, of sorts, on Facebook, in which she claimed that after the first time Weinstein attended Actors Hour, nobody complained (attendees of the Sept. 30 event dispute this). Her statement reads, in part:\n\n\u201cAs always, I welcome and encourage an open dialogue between myself and the community, when I did not receive any feedback on his presence, I chose not to turn him away when he returned. I was subsequently not prepared to handle such a high-energy situation.\n\n\u201cI am deeply saddened that this was not only triggering for attendees, but that they ultimately felt unsafe\u2014some even outraged\u2014when a safe environment is, at its core, what I set out to create. Creating an environment that is at once safe but also leaves open forum for free speech is an extremely fragile endeavor.\u201d\n\n\u201c To the alleged cancel culture\u2019s chagrin, the men denounced in the wake of #MeToo (and before it)\u2014from Louis C.K. to Woody Allen to Casey Affleck to Roman Polanski and more\u2014will keep coming back for more. They feel it is their right. \u201d\n\nAbout Stuckless\u2019 removal from the event upon exercising their own right to free speech, Laliberte wrote, \u201cWhen [Mx.] Stuckless confronted Mr. Weinstein directly, I couldn\u2019t hear what was being said\u2014and wasn\u2019t sure if someone was beginning a performance or monologue. By the time [they were] walking out it was too late. [They] should not have been encouraged to leave. Then and there, I should have shut down the event or given [Stuckless] the microphone to vocalize [their] feelings, but I was in total shock and I let my fear and inexperience paralyze my decision making ability.\u201d\n\nThere is, to use a clich\u00e9, a lot to unpack in Laliberte\u2019s statement, which is also why it provides an opportunity to better understand what happens to workers in the entertainment industry\u2014 especially those without multi-million dollar contracts being offered to them\u2014when they speak up about their conditions. Laliberte describes Actors Hour as a speakeasy \u201cbuilt with the purpose of creating our own tables in an industry that oftentimes leaves so many artists out of the current ones that have stood for too long.\u201d But with Actors Hour, Laliberte has not only offered performance opportunities to actors mostly shut out of the industry, but also to a credibly accused abuser who used to control the very industry that ignored these performers. To her, this was the balance required to create an \u201copen forum for free speech.\u201d\n\nThe bombshell investigative stories published in The New York Times and The New Yorker on Weinstein\u2019s abuses both detail the quid pro quo involved in the producer\u2019s reported misconduct, which often included promising success to the female actors who withstood his abuses and sabotaging the careers of those who did not. The abuse was apparently, itself, business. So that Weinstein would attend an event filled with young, hopeful actors like the very ones he is accused of sexually assaulting, all while awaiting trial for crimes which, if he is convicted, could land him in jail for the rest of his days, comes as no surprise. To the alleged cancel culture\u2019s chagrin, the men denounced in the wake of #MeToo (and before it)\u2014from Louis C.K. to Woody Allen to Casey Affleck to Roman Polanski and others\u2014will keep coming back for more. They feel it is their right.\n\nThe conversation around this reality\u2014male entitlement, especially men who have been accused of wrongdoing\u2014often focuses on whether these men deserve to be welcomed back into society: Will Louis ever tell another joke in public again? Aren\u2019t we all worthy of redemption? What does a guy got to do to get another multi-million dollar deal in this town? But the more urgent, and meaningful, conservation is about those who have not yet succeeded in the industry, from up-and-coming comedians to struggling actors to the staff who serve at the bars, clubs, and festivals where these men tend to trickle back in, and how more space might be made for their voices, dissent, ideas, disavowals. If action around #MeToo within the entertainment industry is only interested in the performers who already have leverage\u2014SAG and WGA members, TV regulars, award-winners, and movie stars\u2014then the abuses will simply settle more deeply into the more vulnerable places they fester: the clubs, showcases, and modest backstage corridors defined by the mix of wild ambition and economic precarity of the performers who make their way through them.\n\nThe fact is that, as relatively unknown performers, Stuckless, Bachman, Rollo, and Brown all had much more to lose by speaking up than they did by sitting silently as Weinstein exercised his right to \u201cdue process\u201d at the event that was supposed to be for them. In her apology note, Laliberte emphasizes her good intentions while remaining exceptionally passive. She \u201cset out\u201d to create an event that did not occur. Instead, others were \u201ctriggered,\u201d \u201ceven outraged\u201d by the event she did create. That night was \u201can extremely fragile endeavor\u201d that she just did not calibrate quite right. She was \u201cin total shock and let her fear and inexperience paralyze\u201d her good sense. While many have come after her in the comments, her incompetence is more likely to be rewarded by the industry\u2014which tends to prefer obedient both-siders to furious rabble-rousers\u2014than the performers\u2019 boldness. And Laliberte knows this. It\u2019s why she let Weinstein into her event in the first place.\n\nSo where do the furious go? It remains to be seen. As long as \u201cfree speech\u201d means that the powerful and abusive can access whatever spaces they like, if they\u2019re not already physically in jail, the question will be left to those with the fewest resources available to them.
