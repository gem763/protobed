I lived in Glenfield but as well as selling the house, Joanne got rid of everything inside it.\n\n\u201cShe sold all my wedding jewellery, my mum\u2019s rings and my photos and everything else has gone. Everything I ever had.\u201d\n\nLooking to her window sill where there are two small photographs of her parents, she said: \u201cThey are the only ones I have left now.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I have. They\u2019re from a small photo album I had with me.\u201d\n\nAs well as many things of sentimental value, the items that disappeared from her home included her passport, driving licence and birth certificate, meaning she\u2019s struggled to open a new bank account and Leicestershire County Council is still in control of what money she has.\n\nDescribing how the problems began, Susan said: \u201cWhen my father died I had a nervous breakdown and I had a drinking problem.\n\n\"It all went to pot and Joanne decided I would be better off in a care home.\n\n\u201cShe never thought I\u2019d recover.\n\n\u201cFor five years I had to share a room. I had no contact with friends so at the care home I volunteered to sit downstairs with the visitors book just so I could get to speak to people.\n\n\u201cThen one day at Hunter\u2019s Lodge the manager said, \u2018I\u2019ve got news for you, she\u2019s sold your house\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was awful.\u201d\n\n(Image: Leicester Mercury / BPM Media)\n\nThe one good thing remaining in Susan\u2019s life through these years has been her son Mark, who is an older half-brother to Joanne and had been kept in the dark throughout Joanne\u2019s offending and called the police when he found out the house had been sold.\n\nSusan said: \u201cMark was under the impression they were going to rent it out until I got better and could move back in.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky to have Mark and his wife and three children in my life still.\n\n\"If it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t have any furniture here. I don't know what I would have done without them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve now got my Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis removed from my medical records and my friends come to visit me again, too.\u201d\n\nAfter everything she has been through, Susan has no interest in seeing her daughter again.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf she comes here she won\u2019t get in.\n\n\u201cWhen my friends hear about what she\u2019s done they can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. They can\u2019t believe what she\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nShe said she hoped Joanne would lose her job with the NHS after the way she had defrauded her own mother.\n\nShe said: \u201cShe can\u2019t go into the community with elderly people.\"\n\nThe Proceeds of Crime Act is used to regain assets which were acquired through criminal means.\n\nWhen the available amount from the defendant is less than the amount they benefited by, the defendant is only ordered to pay the amount they have available.\n\nThis can mean, that even if a criminal benefited significantly from the crime, they may not have access to any assets, as in this case.\n\nThe judge will then order a minimal repayment, usually \u00a31.\n\nA spokesperson for the CPS said: \"In the case of Joanne Chiswell, the court determined she had no assets available to pay any confiscation order and issued a minimal repayment to reflect that.\n\n\"If the situation changed and she was found to have assets at a later stage, the CPS would return the matter to court and request an increased confiscation order to recover those new assets, up to the full benefit amount.\"", "description": "The heartless daughter sold her mum's house and belongings, spending the proceeds on shopping and meals out", "authors": ["Tom Mack", "Image", "Leicester Mercury", "Bpm Media", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18762537.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS188509283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
