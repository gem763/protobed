While Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) and Stuart (Ricky Champ) were pleased to see the Walford icon back on the Square, Tiffany (Maisie Smith) was less than pleased with Dotty\u2019s return, as she knew it could only spell trouble.\n\nThus far, it\u2019s been rather hard to gauge what Dotty\u2019s motives for being back in the Square are, and it would certainly seem like she\u2019s matured quite a bit over the past decade, but her true colours could be set to come to light, as she causes problems in the coming episodes when she tries to sabotage Keegan\u2019s business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the incident with Dotty, Ian (Adam Woodyatt) \u2014 who\u2019s kitchen Keegan has been working out of \u2014 encourages the young man to give up. But whether or not he does so remains to be seen.\n\nLater in the week, Tiffany\u2019s fuming when she discovers what Dotty did, and wastes little time in confronting her.\n\nBut what will Dotty have to say for herself?\n\nIt\u2019s clear from her actions that she\u2019s trying to cause trouble for Keegan, but given than her and Tiff haven\u2019t exactly got off on the right foot, could she perhaps be trying to split the happy couple up?\n\nOr will there be a perfectly reasonable explanation for her actions?\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 29th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Dotty's true colours are seemingly coming to light.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18730115-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-6497_1571226471.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
