I always want True to be surrounded by love. I just want her to always feel bliss just as much as I can.\"\n\n\"It's hard, it's not easy for me. It would be easier for me to keep my daughter away and be like, 'No, 'cause you hurt me.' But, he never hurt True.\n\n(Image: Eric Charbonneau/REX/Shutterstoc)\n\n\"Him and I have our own relationship, and then Tristan and True have theirs. And I will never come in between that, I don't believe in that.\"\n\nKhloe also said on the podcast that she does not people to feel sorry for her.\n\n\"It's natural to almost be the victim.
