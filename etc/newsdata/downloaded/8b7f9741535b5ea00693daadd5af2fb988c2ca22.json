He said he is working out how he can help car makers \"within the confines of either World Trade Organization state aid rules, or, if we have a deal, EU state aid rules.\"\n\nCarmakers have been vocal in opposing the sort of no-deal Brexit Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he\u2019s pursuing if he can\u2019t reach an accord by Oct. 31. They\u2019ve warned it would be \"devastating\" for the industry, disrupting just-in-time supply lines and ushering in tariffs that would drive up costs and make exports uncompetitive.\n\nProduction Move\n\nPSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said in July that all production will be pulled from its Ellesmere Port plant if Brexit makes it impossible to turn a profit at the 1,000-worker Vauxhall-brand facility. Nissan has suggested it may move some production out of the U.K. if the country leaves the EU without a deal.\n\n\u201cAny decision is not straightforward. We have to carefully analyze all the situations,\u201d Gianluca de Ficchy, chairman of Nissan Europe said when asked on Thursday about the possibility of closing plant in Sunderland, northeast England. \u201cThe only clear conclusion we have reached is that if WTO tariffs will be applied, it will not be sustainable.\u201d\n\nNissan, which sends 70% of its U.K. output to the EU, is urging Johnson\u2019s government to support the industry by agreeing with the bloc not to apply tariffs, de Ficchy said. The imposition of WTO rules with a 10% duty on U.K.-built cars shipped to the EU would be impossible to offset through cost cuts, he said.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit would have an immediate impact on the industry, putting jobs at risk and causing severe and potentially irreversible damage,\u201d Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement. \u201cThe U.K. and EU automotive industries are deeply integrated so we need a deal that guarantees free and frictionless trade. Anything less risks destroying this vital industry\u201d\n\nZahawi said one of the tools he\u2019s considering is the so-called exceptional regional growth fund -- an award of grants outside normal competitive bidding processes designed to assist \"where the economic situation in a local area deteriorates suddenly.\" He said the U.K. will seek to avoid disruption to supply chains in a no-deal Brexit by not imposing additional border checks.\n\n\"Essentially, we\u2019re going to waive the deliveries through,\" he said, adding that there have been \"encouraging noises\" from authorities in Calais, the main French port for the U.K., that they\u2019re \"not going to cause any problems either because they don\u2019t want to harm French businesses.\"\n\nStill, that\u2019s far from a cast-iron guarantee that there won\u2019t be disruption, because the French will be obliged to follow EU laws and enforce a customs border.\n\nZahawi also said that the government is pushing an ambition for Britain to lead the world in developing electric vehicles and hydrogen technology, including a drive to develop a so-called gigafactory to make electric car batteries in the U.K.\n\nThe government announced as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.22 billion) of investment to accelerate the development of new battery technology and hydrogen fuel cells last month.\n\nZahawi said ministers are in talks with half a dozen or so companies around the world -- including in China and Japan -- about developing a gigafactory in the U.K. He didn\u2019t identify the companies.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net;Siddharth Philip in Sunderland at sphilip3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is looking at the tools it can use to support carmakers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi said.The government is in talks with companies including PSA Group, Toyota Corp., Ford Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc to", "authors": ["Alex Morales", "Siddharth Philip"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
