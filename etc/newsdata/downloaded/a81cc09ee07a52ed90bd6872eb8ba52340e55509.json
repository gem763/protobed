Bernie Sanders came to this city in August to decry not President Trump, whom he is hoping to unseat, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in the Kentucky Republican\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to stop democracy in the United States Senate,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, as if addressing Mr. McConnell directly, calling on him to stop killing Democratic legislation in the chamber. Mr. McConnell has done that so often that he dubbed himself the \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d at an event this year.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s appearance is part of Democrats\u2019 nationwide effort\u2014whether campaigning for president, the Senate or House\u2014to raise funds by painting the majority leader, the longest-serving GOP leader in Senate history, as the reason progressive legislation has stalled.\n\nThere is little prospect that the attacks will succeed in ousting Mr. McConnell from the Senate next year, given his record as a tenacious campaigner who plans for races years in advance and the fact that Kentucky is a heavily Republican state. But Democrats are seeking to make him, along with President Trump, a bogeyman for their campaigns nationwide, much as Republicans have sought to do with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.)\n\n\u201cThe Democratic message is that the Republican Senate is preventing action on so many problems,\u201d said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, whose research often focuses on the Senate. \u201cAs soon as you can attach a personality to it, it adds considerable depth.\u201d\n\nMindful of how his standing with conservatives has strengthened as Democrats step up their attacks, Mr. McConnell has frequently embraced his persona as a villain of the left. His office is adorned with cartoons lampooning him, and he boasts about his mastery of Senate procedure.\n\n\u201cThe more that they demonize him, the stronger he gets,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell who remains close to the majority leader. \u201cIt further fortifies him with his own electorate.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you think Democrats are making the best use of their campaign funds by targeting Mitch McConnell, or are there are better uses for it? Join the conversation below.\n\nRepublican allies add that the Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 strategy could risk backfiring as they may be wasting time and money on him rather than going after their actual opponent in the race, Mr. Trump.\n\nProgressives have been antagonized by what Mr. McConnell considers to be his proudest achievement: Confirming two Supreme Court justices after blocking President Obama\u2019s last pick for the court, Merrick Garland. Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to focus on confirming federal judges shored up what had been flagging support for him among far-right Republicans, who two years ago sought unsuccessfully to oust him from his leadership post.\n\n\"His value to the [Senate GOP] is immeasurable and that\u2019s why Democrats are obsessed with him,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm.\n\nMr. McConnell took to the Senate floor in July to complain about being labeled by some Democrats as \u201ca Russian asset\u201d and \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d His critics had cited his decision to block a vote on legislation to secure voting systems, as well as legislation aimed at deterring Russia from new election interference by threatening sanctions on its banking, energy and defense sectors. Mr. McConnell has objected to election-security bills, which he has called overly partisan, and generally has preferred to focus on confirming judges instead of using limited floor time on legislation.\n\n\u201cThe outraged industrial complex needed a new target, and that is where I come in\u2014Mitch McConnell\u2014the hawkish foreign policy conservative who has spent decades pushing back on Russia every way I can think of, was accused of what amounts to treason by multiple media outlets within a couple of hours,\" the Senate majority leader said.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s likely challenger in next year\u2019s election\u2014former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath \u2014has raised $7 million since entering the race in July, according to her campaign. The senator, with the advantage of being a six-term incumbent and a national Republican leader in a deep-red state, will be difficult to unseat.\n\nBut Ms. McGrath is financially competitive against Mr. McConnell, who had raised $10.6 million by midyear, more than any other Republican defending a Senate seat. In his last election, in 2014, he spent almost all of his $31 million war chest, even though his rival had raised just $19 million.\n\nA fund called Ditch Mitch, started last year after Mr. McConnell succeeded in getting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh confirmed, has raised $3.5 million\u2014roughly on par with the amount raised by the majority leader from individual donors in the first half of this year. Party Majority, a super PAC, is raising money for a new project called MoscowMitch.com, aimed at defeating Mr. McConnell and tying him to the Republicans campaigning for Senate seats. The Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm said digital fundraising from March to July was better than in any other nonelection year; 90% of the ads mentioned the Senate majority leader.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates have cited Mr. McConnell in at least 60 fundraising emails since April, according to a collection maintained by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFormer Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, when he announced his Senate bid in August, wrote in a fundraising pitch that incumbent GOP Sen. Cory Gardner \u201cvotes 99% of the time with Donald Trump and goes along with Mitch McConnell\u2019s obstruction and partisan political games.\u201d\n\nThe effectiveness of such a pitch has been borne out in a poll commissioned by End Citizens United\u2014a major Democratic donor since it was founded to undo a 2010 Supreme Court decision allowing unlimited political expenditures. The political-action committee found in 12 battleground states this spring that Democrats got more of a bump from painting Mr. McConnell as an obstructionist than from depicting Mr. Trump as the reason liberal policy goals were stuck.\n\nProgressive activists, with increasing support from Democratic presidential hopefuls, are pushing to curb Mr. McConnell\u2019s power if the party retakes the Senate by ending the legislative filibuster, a procedural tool that empowers the minority in the chamber. Most bills need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold 53 of the chamber\u2019s 100 seats. Progressives would eliminate the option in the Senate, whose procedures have traditionally required bipartisan cooperation to pass legislation, and allow bills to pass with a simple majority, as they do in the House.\n\n\u201cIn this country, radical changes face a high bar by design,\u201d Mr. McConnell responded in an August op-ed in The New York Times. \u201cIt is telling that today\u2019s left-wing activists would rather lower that bar than produce ideas that can meet it.\u201d\n\n\u2014Eliza Collins and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "description": "Democrats have launched a nationwide effort to raise funds by painting Mitch McConnell as the reason progressive legislation has stalled.
