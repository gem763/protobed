Media Lab\u2019s director of development, was placed on administrative leave, the university confirmed Sunday in a statement to The Providence Journal.\n\n\u201cWe are engaged in a review of available information regarding Mr. Cohen in the context of Brown University policies, core values and the University\u2019s commitment to treat employees fairly. Mr. Cohen is on administrative leave pending this review,\" wrote university spokesperson Brian Clark, adding that Brown did not receive any funds from Epstein.\n\nOn Saturday, Cohen\u2019s former co-worker and director of the Media Lab, Joi Ito, stepped down.\n\nBoth men were the subjects of a bombshell report by The New Yorker on Friday, which featured emails and documents that showed how Cohen and Ito continued to receive money from Epstein anonymously, or as \u201cdirected\u201d by Epstein from other wealthy investors, including Bill Gates and Leon Black, the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein had been identified as \u201cdisqualified\u201d in M.I.T.\u2019s database of donors, according to the report, but still, his donations poured in.\n\n\u201cJeffrey money, needs to be anonymous. Thanks,\u201d Cohen wrote in one email, dated Sept. 9, 2014, in response to an earlier email from Ito, which read: \u201cMake sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.\u201d\n\nIn an October 16 email from that same year, Ito sent an internal email \u2014 and signed his name \u2014 about a $2 million \u201cgift from Bill Gates directed by Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat!,\u201d Cohen responded, according to the emails, which are featured in the report.\n\n\u201cFor gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve let 2 folks in central development who need to know know.\u201d\n\nGates\u2019s spokesperson told The New Yorker that any claims that Epstein directed grants on the billionaire\u2019s behalf were \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nThe multimillionaire was indicted in the Southern District of New York in July for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and sex trafficking of minors. The case was dismissed in late August, after Epstein was found dead inside his Metropolitan Correctional Center jail cell in lower Manhattan.\n\nThe New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner later determined Epstein had hanged himself to death.\n\nM.I.T. President L. Rafael Reif and Ito had previously released separate statements in August acknowledging that they had received funds from Epstein-run foundations.\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for my error in judgment. I am deeply sorry to the survivors, to the Media Lab, and to the MIT community for bringing such a person into our network,\u201d Ito\u2019s August 15 apology, states, in part.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFollowing Friday\u2019s report, Ito sent a second memo, this time internally, which read:\n\n\u201cAfter giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Two school officials have left their posts -- either\u00a0permanently or until further notice -- in the wake of a scathing report detailing how the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab willingly received donations from Jeffrey Epstein, despite that the financier was \"disqualified\" as a donor.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/epstein-MIT-Stock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
