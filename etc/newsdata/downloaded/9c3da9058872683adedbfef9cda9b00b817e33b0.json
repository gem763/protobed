Kosovo dropped to third with eight points, one behind the Czech Republic who beat Montenegro 3-0 away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the high level and we lost some unnecessary balls and were immediately in danger,\u201d said Kosovo manager Bernard Challandes, who was upbeat despite the defeat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in such situations how we can do better. But if we see the second half we can be proud of this team, they showed good football and they don\u2019t give up \u2014 they play as a team.\u201d\n\nKosovo, who had been on a 15-match unbeaten run coming into the England game, will still believe they can qualify for their first tournament finals, just four years after gaining international status from world soccer\u2019s governing body FIFA.\n\nEngland can clinch qualification for the finals with a win away to the Czech Republic in their next game on Oct. 11.\n\nKOSOVO THREAT\n\nSouthgate had warned beforehand of Kosovo\u2019s threat and it took only 35 seconds to materialise, albeit from a dreadful mistake by England defender Michael Keane.\n\nWithout looking, he played a casual pass across his area and the gift was accepted by Muriqi who intercepted and played in Berisha to clip a fine finish past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\n\nThat lit the touchpaper for a stunning opening half in which England\u2019s attacking play was devastating.\n\nThe home side were level seven minutes later with Keane making up for his error by heading Ross Barkley\u2019s corner across goal for Sterling to nod a real poacher\u2019s goal \u2014 his sixth in four Euro 2020 qualifying games.\n\nSo often forced to break down massed defences, England were relishing the wide open spaces left by an attack-minded Kosovo.\n\nAfter 19 minutes Sterling spun his marker on the halfway line, accelerated forward and slipped a weighted pass to Kane who fired the ball under the body of Muric.\n\nKosovo were still very much in the game but their big night began to unravel as England struck three goals in seven minutes.\n\nChallandes was furious as play was allowed to continue in the 38th minute with a Kosovo player down injured and his mood darkened when Mergim Vojvoda, who minutes earlier fired just wide, tapped in an own goal from Sancho\u2019s low cross.\n\nSterling then made two jet-heeled bursts to provide Borussia Dortmund teenager Sancho with his first senior England goals.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nKosovo could have been excused for shutting up shop after the break to try and keep the score down but that does not appear to be in the DNA of Challandes\u2019s side.\n\nIn the 49th minute Muriqi\u2019s floated pass found Berisha who took a sublime touch before beating Pickford and six minutes later Muriqi converted a penalty after being brought down by Harry Maguire to give Kosovo hope of an incredible comeback.\n\nEngland were never really totally in control but Kane wasted the chance to settle the jitters when his penalty was read by Muric who dived to his right to save well and the Nottingham Forest keeper then turned Sterling\u2019s shot against the post.", "description": "England's march towards the Euro 2020 finals continued but not quite in the manner they might have expected as they beat a brave and enterprising Kosovo side 5-3 in an extraordinary Group A qualifier at St Mary's Stadium on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428473659&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89275", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
