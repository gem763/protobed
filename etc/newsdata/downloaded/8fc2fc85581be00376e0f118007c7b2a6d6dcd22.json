Inflation has since eased to 15% and is expected to fall briefly to single digits in October thanks to the \"base effect\" measurement against last year's spike.\n\nThe decline in inflation and a shift among the world's major central banks to more accommodation has stemmed further losses in the lira this year and paved the way for the Turkish rate cuts, which are set to continue until year end according to economists.\n\nThe lira firmed to 5.6825 against the dollar after the announcement from 5.7500 beforehand, and was up about 1% on the day on relief that the central bank did not slash rates far more than initially expected.\n\nAccording to a Reuters poll on Tuesday, economists expected the bank to lower rates by a median of 250 basis points. However before the decision, swap-market traders were expecting a cut of between 300 and 400 points.\n\nCentral bank governor Murat Uysal, appointed by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in early July after his predecessor did not follow policy instructions, has said policy will aim to deliver a \"reasonable\" real interest rate.\n\nErdogan is a self-described \"enemy\" of high interest rates and has said they, along with inflation, would fall to single digits in a short time.\n\nOn Thursday, the central bank said a \"cautious\" policy stance was necessary to keep the \"disinflation process on track.\" It added that inflation will likely slide \"slightly below\" its year-end forecast of 13.9%, which it made in July.\n\nAnkara has attempted to boost lending by state banks to reinvigorate an economy that entered a recession last year and experienced contractions in the first two quarters of this year.
