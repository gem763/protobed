Previously, for example, the only way to travel from Maputo to Catembe was a 10-minute trip on a crowded ferry.\n\nBeatriz Cossa used to take that ferry ride to get supplies from the capital. Now, a new bridge and 60-mile road allows for a quick ride in a subsidized bus. But that bridge didn't come without cost: her old home was located underneath the highway. She was compensated for her loss with a new plot of land and a better house, but it's a lot further away. She also had to leave behind her parents' burial site, her friends and her memories.\n\n\"You see my heart,\" she said. \"I cried a lot.\"\n\nMozambique's new bridge offers hope -- and pain -- for residents. CBS News\n\nThe Mozambican government said the state-of-the-art infrastructure will ultimately bridge the country's massive wealth gap by increasing tourism and trade.\n\nA journey from the capital to the border with South Africa used to take five hours, and the road was so bad that you could only drive on it if you were wealthy enough to own a luxury four-wheel drive. Now, with the new road, it takes just over an hour to get there.\n\nThe road has also improved access to places like Ponta do Ouro, where Celma Issufo battled for 25 years to make ends meet at her beach restaurant. When the new road opened, her business was transformed.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" she said. Issufo is making enough money to add a bed and breakfast to her restaurant, and she's planning her first holiday abroad.\n\nOlder roads in Mozambique made transportation almost impossible. CBS News\n\nBut the new road has also had unintended consequences. Filming on hidden camera, CBS News traveled with smugglers who move tax-free goods and undocumented Mozambicans illegally across the border. The smuggled men and women pay just under $25 to be taken into South Africa in search of jobs.\n\n\n\nOne smuggler said corrupt police officers patrolling the border have benefited the most from the new road. \"We pay them bribes,\" he said, \"so we can go across the border.\"\n\nBut the economic benefits still seem to outweigh the problems \u2014 the road has increased tourism and bilateral trade between South Africa and Mozambique.\n\nThose economic gains now need to reach the nearly 50% of Mozambicans living on the equivalent of just over $20 a month, who cannot afford the $4 toll.\n\n", "description": "In Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, many areas are inaccessible because of the treacherous road conditions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/b57ad0d1-4180-4683-9c31-53d342a41e6c/thumbnail/1200x630/9cfd1e94456141fc285ed919ed0d6800/bridge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
