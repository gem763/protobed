Schiff said his panel is moving forward with its impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump and will hear from the inspector general again this week, as well as five state department officials.\n\nIn an interview with ABC, the California Democrat said he\u2019s negotiating with the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys so lawmakers can speak directly with the individual who has accused the president of pressuring a foreign government to probe his potential 2020 rival, Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cWe will get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nThe comments come after the government\u2019s watchdog met with lawmakers in a session last week to discuss the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nEven before the watchdog came to Capitol Hill, Democrats had already announced their impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cWe are moving forward with all speed,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nBut Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, said the whistleblower is part of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d claiming the informant should be labeled a partisan operative and is undeserving of whistleblower status.\n\nThe president\u2019s adviser charged the individual, who The New York Times reported was on detail to the White House from the CIA, is part of a group of unelected bureaucrats trying to take down Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThey leak this president\u2019s phone calls,\u201d Mr. Miller told Fox News. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this continuously for nearly three years.\u201d\n\nBut the House Democrats say the whistleblower\u2019s complaint has been found credible, and Mr. Schiff has requested depositions from five State Department officials for later this week, including from former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint led the administration to release the transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nThat call has become the subject of an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, formally launched last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. House Democrats assert the president was pressuring a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat, told CNN the House is pursuing an impeachment inquiry because the president allegedly withheld about $391 million in financial assistance from Ukraine and asked the country\u2019s president to look into Mr. Biden and his son over a $50,000 per month payment in connection to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\u201cThe president has abused his power,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said.\n\nThe White House, though, contends the transcript of the call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows there was no attempt to use the threat of withholding aid to pressure the foreign leader.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, said the conversation doesn\u2019t reveal a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe transcript gives you no reason to impeach this president,\u201d Mr. Jordan told CNN.\n\nInstead, White House officials have asserted there was wrongdoing on behalf of the Bidens \u2014 not Mr. Trump.\n\nRepublicans have claimed Mr. Biden tried to stop an investigation into his son and the energy company by demanding a Ukrainian prosecutor be fired.\n\nAnd Mr. Miller said the president was the one exposing the corruption between Ukraine and the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is a whistleblower,\u201d Mr. Miller told Fox News.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani told ABC he discovered the Bidens\u2019 actions with Ukraine while he was probing former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and it\u2019s contacts with foreign governments during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden may have done something like this,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
