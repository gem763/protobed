Instead, the Nationals will turn to Scherzer as a starter in Game 4 in an effort to keep their season alive.\n\nTurning point\n\nWith the Nationals clinging to a 2-1 lead and Corbin on in relief of starter Anibal Sanchez, the Dodgers finally were able to put a couple hits together in the top of the sixth.\n\nWith two outs and runners on the corners, Corbin was on the verge of getting out of the inning unscathed when he got two quick strikes on catcher Russell Martin. However Martin wouldn\u2019t chase a slider in the dirt and he took a fastball up out of the strike zone to even the count.\n\nWhen Corbin tried to get him to chase a 2-2 slider, Martin jumped on it and split the gap in left field. As the ball bounced off the wall, two runners came around to score. In the blink of an eye, a one-run deficit became a one-run Dodger lead.\n\nNLDS: Braves stun Cardinals in St. Louis to take 2-1 series lead\n\nYANKEES: Forgotten ace can give Bombers a path to glory\n\nMan of the moment\n\nTurner had a single, double home run and three RBI to ignite the Dodgers\u2019 12-hit attack in Game 3.\n\nAfter only getting five hits and going 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position in Game 2, the Dodgers \u2013 who led the National League in scoring, home runs and OPS during the regular season \u2013 had stranded five runners on base over the first five innings of Game 3.\n\nHis three-run homer helped break open a close game and help the Dodgers regain their offensive mojo.\n\nDodgers players celebrate after Justin Turner's three-run homer in the sixth.

With two outs in the sixth inning, Roberts sent three pinch-hitters to the plate in the span of four hitters.\n\nAll three came through with huge hits.\n\nLefty-killer David Freese (1.172 OPS vs. lefties during the regular season) extended the inning with a ground-ball single to right to put runners on the corners. After Martin\u2019s two-run, go-ahead double, Roberts kept the pressure on by sending up Chris Taylor to hit for pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu.\n\nTaylor drew a walk to set up another two-run double from Kike Hernandez to push the lead to 4-1 and the Dodgers never looked back.\n\nNeeding a mulligan\n\nCorbin has now taken the loss in both of the Nationals\u2019 defeats in the NLDS. He was the losing pitcher in Game 1, despite allowing just two runs (one earned) in six innings.\n\nHe was nowhere near as sharp in Game 3, making his first relief appearance in two years. He yielded up a total of six runs on four hits and two walks in just 2/3 of an inning.\n\nHowever, Corbin may get one more opportunity to pitch in the series if the Nationals can force a fifth game in Los Angeles. His relatively brief appearance (35 pitches) could allow him to come back on two days\u2019 rest to give the Nations another lefty reliever.\n\nState of the series\n\nThe Dodgers take a 2-1 lead into Game 4 on Monday night at Nationals Park, looking to close out the NLDS on the road.\n\nThe Nationals will have their ace, Scherzer, on the mound \u2013 just three days after throwing 14 pitches in his scoreless inning of relief in Game 2. He\u2019ll need to throw considerably more in Game 4. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the number is right now,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of out the door. It\u2019s just how you feel and communicate with the coaches on what you think you can do.\u201d\n\nLeft-hander Rich Hill will be on the hill for the Dodgers, making it a matchup of two of the most intense pitchers in the game.\n\n\u201cI love the competition part of this,\u201d Hill said. \u201cLooking across the way, when you talk about guys that you really enjoy watching pitch \u2026 he\u2019s definitely up there for me the way he competes and his intensity out there on the mound.\u201d\n\nDue to a knee injury, Hill only pitched 6 \u2154 innings in the second half, all of them coming in three September appearances. For that reason, he\u2019s not expected to go very deep into the game before turning things over to the Dodger bullpen.", "description": "The Dodgers scored seven runs in the fifth inning and went on to win 10-4 in NLDS Game 3 against the Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
