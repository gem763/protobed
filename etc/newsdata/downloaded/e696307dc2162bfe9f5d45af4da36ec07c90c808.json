As leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, I add my apologies on their behalf to the entire population of Quebec.\"\n\nBlanchet's statement does not name any of the candidates, though it indicates he has spoken to five individuals \u2014 four women and one man.\n\nThe apology is almost certainly in response to a Journal de Montr\u00e9al story published Thursday that documented numerous posts, tweets and shared links on Facebook and Twitter by: Caroline Desbiens, a candidate in the Beauport riding; Lizabel Nitoi, running in Marc-Aur\u00e8le-Fortin; Val\u00e9rie Tremblay in Chicoutimi\u2013Le Fjord; and Claude Forgues in Sherbrooke.\n\nThe fifth candidate is likely Nicole Morin, a Bloc candidate in Saint-Maurice\u2013Champlain who was found to have shared a video by the far-right group La Meute.\n\nThe four Bloc candidates cited in the Journal article issued identical statements of apology on social media Thursday.\n\nA screen capture of the apology issued by Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate Lizabel Nitoi, who is running in the Marc-Aur\u00e8le-Fortin riding. (Facebook)\n\nThe boilerplate apologies, written in the first person, all say that the candidates did not mean to offend. They all begin by noting that the newspaper reported \"the fact that I shared, a few years ago, on social networks an article that [the newspaper] considers Islamophobic.\"\n\nThe four candidates go on to affirm in their statements their \"total and complete support for the values and program of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u2026 which in no way advocates measures that go against some communities, whether cultural or religious.\"\n\nThe controversy lands ahead of the second French-language debate, set for Thursday.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been building momentum ever since the first French-language debate last week. Polls suggest Blanchet was the big winner of that contest and that the Bloc's support levels have increased as a result.", "description": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet apologized Thursday after media outlets uncovered a number of Islamophobic and\u00a0racist social media posts by candidates running for the sovereigntist party.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306044.1570037232!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-campaign-20191002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
