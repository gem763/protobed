They moved three points clear of Atletico, who drew 1-1 at home to Valencia.\n\nThe victory also dismissed suggestions their players might be affected by Friday\u2019s postponement of next Saturday\u2019s Clasico due to protests in Catalonia.\n\nViolence in Barcelona and disruptions at El Prat airport meant Ernesto Valverde\u2019s side altered their pre-match routine and embarked on a 589-kilometre bus trip to the Basque County on Friday.\n\nAll the while, discussions continued over the Clasico against Real Madrid, which is now expected to go ahead in December.\n\n\u201cIt is fashionable not to agree on political issues but at least let\u2019s agree on the date of the Clasico,\u201d Valverde said afterwards. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that difficult.\u201d\n\nPerhaps chaos off the pitch inspired Barca to unite on it.\n\nThis was their fifth consecutive victory in all competitions, a sequence which is swiftly erasing memories of a stumbling start to the season.\n\nThe resurgence has coincided with Messi\u2019s return from injury yet it was the fluidity and cohesion of the front three, rather than the Argentinian\u2019s familiar solo brilliance, that will have been most pleasing for Valverde.\n\n\u201cGreat players always understand each other,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cWith time and matches they will understand each other even more.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Four for Griezmann \u2013\n\nGriezmann has four goals since joining Barca from Atletico Madrid last summer but a series of underwhelming showings led to Ousmane Dembele starting against Sevilla before the international break.\n\nThere was good news too for Barcelona in defence, where Samuel Umtiti came through 90 minutes in what was his first appearance of the season. Umtiti, who has been out with a foot injury, replaced the banned Gerard Pique.\n\nThe only blot on the result was an injury to Sergi Roberto, who hurt his left knee and was replaced at half-time. He will be a doubt for the Champions League game away at Slavia Prague on Wednesday.\n\nThe visiting fans chanted in support of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned last week for a failed independence bid in 2017.\n\nGriezmann\u2019s finish clipped the inside of the post and found the net after 13 minutes.\n\nMessi should have made it two before half-time but was denied one-on-one by goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic. Suarez\u2019s goal was ruled for offside.\n\nBarca made it two just before the hour as Frenkie de Jong\u2019s incisive ball was collected by Suarez. As he lost control, Griezmann took over, flicking left to Messi, who made no mistake.\n\nThe third involved all three again. Griezmann\u2019s superb reverse pass set Messi clear and he generously slipped the ball left for Suarez who was left with an open goal.\n\nAtletico lost ground as they were undone by a late Dani Parejo free-kick against Valencia at the Wanda Metropolitano, where both sides finished the game with 10 men.\n\nDiego Costa scored a first-half penalty. In a mad final 10 minutes, Joao Felix limped off with all three of his team\u2019s substitutes already used, Parejo struck in the 82nd minute and Valencia\u2019s Lee Kang-In was sent off in injury-time.\n\nFelix\u2019s fitness will be a concern ahead of Atletico\u2019s Champions League game at home to Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Barcelona\u2019s \u2018MSG\u2019 strike force is finally clicked into gear as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann all", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/be884a_eibar-goalkeeper-marko-dmitrovic-stopped-lionel-messi-but-barcelona-striker-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
