The launch aims to unite Coach\u2019s long history of leather craftsmanship with creative director Stuart Vever\u2019s more modern sensibilities. Yesterday, that sensibility was on display during his Spring 2020 ready-to-wear presentation, where a special edit of the bags appeared on the runway \u2014 an edit that the Cut can reveal exclusively.\n\nThe designs fall somewhere between new and old, which, in the age of teens hooked on Depop, seems fitting. They are categorized as Restored, Remixed, or Remade. It\u2019s pretty much what it sounds like: Restored bags are vintage bags that have been made to seem like new again, Remixed bags are inspired by a combination of vintage Coach styles, and Remade bags are entirely new bags that were inspired by vintage silhouettes.\n\nThe pop-up shop inside Coach\u2019s Madison Avenue store will guide visitors through decades of Coach bags (September 7\u201315 at 595 Madison Ave.). Visitors can try out services like Coach Rented, which allows customers to rent restored, vintage Coach bags. It\u2019s basically \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d with a fashionable twist.
