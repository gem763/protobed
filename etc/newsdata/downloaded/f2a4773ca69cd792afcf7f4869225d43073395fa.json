They are using virtual private networks to mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques to obscure their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the so-called dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.\n\nAs the technologies lower people\u2019s inhibitions, online groups are sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse.\n\n\u201cHistorically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, \u2018I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,\u2019\u201d said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Illinois who leads a team investigating online child abuse. \u201cBut now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.\u201d\n\nLawmakers foresaw the crisis years ago, but enforcement has fallen short\n\nCongress passed a landmark law in 2008 that foresaw many of today\u2019s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation. Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved.\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, a sponsor of the law\u2019s reauthorization, said there was \u201cno adequate or logical explanation and no excuse\u201d for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be \u201cvastly inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnother cornerstone of the law, biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. And although a senior executive-level official was to oversee the federal response at the Justice Department, that has not happened.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Stacie B. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up\n\nWith so many reports of the images coming their way, police departments across the country are besieged. Some have managed their workload by focusing efforts on imagery depicting the youngest, most vulnerable victims.\n\n\u201cWe go home and think, \u2018Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,\u2019\u201d said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nAbout one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security\u2019s investigative section is assigned to child sexual exploitation cases, officials said, a clear indication of how big the problem is.\n\n\u201cWe could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,\u201d said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.", "description": "Emerging tech platforms and overwhelmed law enforcement agencies have contributed to a boom in digital abuse imagery, a Times investigation found.
