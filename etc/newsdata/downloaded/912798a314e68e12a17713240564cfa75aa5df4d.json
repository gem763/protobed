On the play, which gave the Capitals a 3-2 lead just 10 seconds after Calgary had tied it, Ovechkin tallied his 665th career goal; he is three behind Luc Robitaille for 12th in NHL history. And Backstrom passed Daniel Sedin for the fifth-most assists (649) by a Swedish-born player.\n\nDuring a game in which the Capitals looked out of sync in the offensive zone early on, their stars ultimately delivered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBackstrom, a phenomenal play to Ovechkin to answer right back,\u201d Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cThose are huge, huge goals. . . . And that is why they are who they are.\u201d\n\nOvechkin extended his point streak to eight games, and his assist on defenseman John Carlson\u2019s goal 35 seconds into the second period broke a scoreless battle. Carlson also extended his point streak to eight games, which matches a career high. He added an empty-netter with 1:45 remaining before the Flames got one back with 15 seconds to go.\n\n\u201cI just said this morning, Johnny for Norris; that is a hashtag right now,\u201d Ovechkin said with a sheepish smile. He was referring to the Norris Trophy, given to the NHL\u2019s top defenseman. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it moving, right?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCarlson has 20 points, which leads the NHL. He is the fourth defenseman in league history to record 20-plus points in October \u2014 and the Capitals have three games left in the month. Carlson has repeatedly expressed a sarcastic suggestion that \u201cluck\u201d is the source of his hot start and, during Tuesday\u2019s performance, that might have been on display. Carlson\u2019s first goal was a shot that managed to squeak past Talbot, and his empty-netter was a bouncer that found the net.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking a lot about John, but it\u2019s well deserved,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe plays the toughest minutes and plays the most minutes, and it\u2019s good to see him get a few bounces go his way.\u201d\n\nBraden Holtby made 32 saves as the Capitals (7-2-2) stretched their winning streak to four games. They\u2019re perfect through two games of a five-game road trip, with a visit to Edmonton on Thursday up next.\n\nAD\n\nCarlson\u2019s second-period tally was the first of a flurry of scoring chances. Chandler Stephenson scored his first goal of the season a little over two minutes later to give the Capitals a 2-0 advantage. The goal came off a mishandled puck by Talbot; from behind the cage, Stephenson banked it into the net off defenseman Rasmus Andersson\u2019s skate.\n\nStephenson only played 9:23, but his fourth line was routinely on the ice against Calgary\u2019s top line, a move that Reirden said \u201chelps build the locker room and builds the culture,\u201d trusting those players to be on the ice for crucial minutes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNice to get the monkey off my back,\u201d Stephenson said of his goal. \u201cNot how I pictured it, but good for sure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCalgary answered with back-to-back goals to tie it \u2014 by Elias Lindholm at 3:19 on a power play and Austin Czarnik at 16:25. Ovechkin\u2019s tally moments later put the Capitals ahead for good, and Tom Wilson gave the Capitals some breathing room with a goal with 7:26 left in the game.\n\n\u201cWe could have done a better job early on finishing games, but guys are just doing their job out there,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWhatever we are doing seems to be the good formula. I think in the first period we come out dry, we didn\u2019t play very well, we turned over pucks. . . . Once we started chipping pucks behind them [and] used strength, forechecking, everything started to open up.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s game also marked the return of forward Garnet Hathaway to Calgary after he signed a four-year, $6 million deal with the Capitals in July. Early on, Hathaway has been a solid fit for Washington, bringing his aggressive, physical style to a team in search of it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Hathaway didn\u2019t find the scoresheet Tuesday, he contributed to a strong effort defensively. In his third game back after tearing his hamstring in March, Michal Kempny was back on the top defensive pairing with Carlson. Kempny said before the game that he felt comfortable on the ice but was still working out some kinks after being away for so long.\n\n\u201cThere are some things that you kind of have to get used to it again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you play more and more games, it is going to get better.\u201d\n\nMore on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Nicklas Backstrom set up Alex Ovechkin for the go-ahead goal in the second period, and John Carlson scored twice.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/luRL2ebIk6vcSrDd-gRKBOl4i5Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SH24HGHVIUI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
