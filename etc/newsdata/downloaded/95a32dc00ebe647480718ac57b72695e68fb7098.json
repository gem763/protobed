The one was of the opinion that he had a low risk of re-offending, while the other felt there was a medium risk.\n\n\"The deviant behaviour by the appellant demonstrates the permanent emotional scars left on an individual following abuse, although [the] appellant downplayed the effect on himself,\" the judges noted.", "description": "A Plettenberg Bay computer engineer has successfully appealed his 15-year jail term on 18 644 counts of possession of child pornography, in the Western Cape High Court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2667/bf817f060b584c33afb8a4cb430de2a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-03"}
