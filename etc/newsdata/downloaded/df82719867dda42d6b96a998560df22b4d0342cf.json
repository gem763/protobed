In keeping with the spirit of this partnership, the Consortium is committed to working with the Department to provide more information about its programs.\"\n\nA spokesperson from Duke University declined to comment directly and referred ABC News back to UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\nThe Education Department was asked in April to look into the universities' joint program by Republican North Carolina Rep. George Holding, who claimed he'd seen \"reports of severe anti-Israeli bias and anti-Semitic rhetoric at a taxpayer-funded conference.\"\n\nIn a letter responding to Holding in June, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said she was \"troubled\" by Holdings' concerns and has directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to \"examine the use of funds under this program.\"\n\nLance King/Getty Images\n\n\"The Department of Education's findings paint a deeply troubling picture,\" Holding tweeted Friday. \"The Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies' use of federal taxpayer funds to promote a biased, ideologically driven agenda is irresponsible and immoral.\"\n\nThe Education Department said in the letter the program places \"a considerable emphasis\" on the \"understanding the positive aspects of Islam, while there is an absolute absence of any similar focus on the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism or any other religion or belief system in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe universities have been instructed to provide a \"revised schedule of activities\" for the next year and to explain how each offering promotes foreign language learning and advances national security interest.", "description": "The Trump administration is demanding that Duke and the University of North Carolina revise a joint Middle East studies program.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/chapel-hill-01-as-gty-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
