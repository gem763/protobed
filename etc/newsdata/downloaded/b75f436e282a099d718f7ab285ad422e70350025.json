But it was my turn to be shocked when I learned that Campbell had been there.\u201d\n\nAlesha, from Airdrie, was only a few days into a family holiday in Rothesay when Campbell took her from her bed on July 2 last year.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nHer body was found the next morning. A \u00adpost-mortem revealed she had suffered 117 injuries.\n\nCampbell was found guilty at trial, and then confessed to the killing before being given a life sentence.\n\nMoira\u2019s disappearance, had a profound effect on Sandra.\n\nUnknown to Sandra at the time, her own dad, bus driver \u00adAlexander Gartshore, had been charged with raping the family\u2019s babysitter, 13.\n\nHe was jailed for the rape just a few weeks after Moira vanished and even though he was driving the bus on which Moira was last seen, he was not questioned about her disappearance at the time.\n\nAs an adult, Sandra researched the disappearance \u2013 her body has never been found \u2013 and learned more about her father\u2019s predatory attraction to girls.\n\nIn 1998, she published a book, Where There is Evil, accusing her father, then still alive, of the crime.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe used proceeds from the book sales to set up the \u00adfoundation in Moira\u2019s name, and in a private capacity, has worked closely with the police and academics to try to recover Moira\u2019s remains.\n\nGartshore died, aged 85, in a Leeds hospital in April 2006 never having been charged in relation to Moira, but the Crown Office has since said he should have been \u00adprosecuted for her murder.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe past 20 years have been a \u00adrollercoaster but we are so proud of what the charity has achieved. It\u2019s been a massive part in the lives of \u00adthousands of families going through the very worst thing they could have imagined.\n\nAs well as supporting them, we have tried to educate children and give them the \u00adconfidence to keep themselves safe, teaching them about what is safe and what isn\u2019t, and about the importance of telling when someone makes them uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThose of us who have delivered that message to schools have seen children taking it all in, and we think we have empowered them.\n\n\"But it was devastating to learn that the message failed to have any effect on one young boy, who went on to commit a most horrific crime.\u201d", "description": "Charity founder Sandra Brown said she had no idea monster Aaron Campbell was in the audience when she gave the talk on the Isle of Bute in Scotland", "authors": ["Marcello Mega", "Image", "Pa", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20004726.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Aaron-Campbell-jail-term-reduced.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
