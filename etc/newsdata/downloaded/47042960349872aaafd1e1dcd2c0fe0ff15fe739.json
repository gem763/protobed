Same-store sales fell 2.1 per cent over the past 16 weeks, an improvement on the 3 per cent decline in the first six weeks of the year.\n\nAcross the group, total sales rose 4.2 per cent in the first 16 weeks, boosted by new stores, and like-for-like sales grew 3.2 per cent, compared with 2.9 per cent in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe figures provide little evidence that record low interest rates and tax cuts have significantly stimulated retail spending.\n\nWhile retail sales are up marginally year on year, retailers say they are having to work harder and dig deeper than ever to convince customers to open their wallets, even though two rate cuts and two tax offset payments are estimated to have boosted disposable incomes by $16 billion.\n\nAnalysts and economists believe record low rates may be undermining consumer confidence in the economy rather than encouraging them to spend.\n\nThe Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index plunged 5.5 per cent in October to its lowest for four years. The weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence rating rose 0.6 per cent to 111.6 points this week after falling 1.2 per cent last week, but sentiment remains below the average of 114.4 points held since 2014 and the longer-term average of 113.1 points since 1990.\n\n\"Retail is tracking along OK but there hasn\u2019t really been a step up [in spending],\" one analyst said. \"What Super Retail Group's trading update demonstrated is you have to do more promotions to drive traffic into stores.\"\n\nMr Heraghty, who took the helm in February, will update investors on the group's strategy next month.\n\nHe said there would be no major deviations and the group would continue to focus on delivering a seamless omni-channel retail experience for customers, integrating its supply chain to reduce costs, simplifying its conglomerate model to remove inefficiencies from duplication and legacy systems, personalising marketing, improving promotional effectiveness and leveraging its brands to create new profit pools.\n\n\"With the right strategy in place and an experienced management team focused on executing that strategy, we are well-positioned to grow our market share and create value for our shareholders,\" he said.", "description": "Shares fall 8.5 per cent as increased discounting helps boost sales but comes at a cost to margins.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6322%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1203%2C$y_443/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2797b63d2e3fc647986c13a53084e102a9ac4a3e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
