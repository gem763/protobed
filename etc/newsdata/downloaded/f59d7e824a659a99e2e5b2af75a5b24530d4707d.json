LOUIS \u2013 They know how baseball works, so they will stop well short of calling themselves invincible.\n\nInstead, the Washington Nationals have performed at such a high level in these playoffs that they have rendered themselves practically unbeatable.\n\nA franchise that 11 days ago was just four outs away from adding to its not-good-enough postseason history has instead taken a tiny opening in a wild card game and burrowed its way to within two victories of the World Series \u2013 while rendering the St. Louis Cardinals thoroughly punchless.\n\nSaturday afternoon at Busch Stadium, Max Scherzer followed in the footsteps of Game 1 starter Anibal Sanchez and carried a no-hitter into the late innings of a National League Championship Game. Like Sanchez, the no-hitter didn\u2019t last, but the Nationals won.\n\nAs they always do these days.\n\nNationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman congratulates his teammates. (Photo: Jeff Curry, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nScherzer struck out 11 Cardinals in his 7 \u2153 innings, but for as great as he and Washington\u2019s starters have been, it was the other end of their ledger that was more telling.\n\nScarcely used center fielder Michael A. Taylor popped a go-ahead, third-inning home run. No. 2 hitter Adam Eaton turned a one-run game into an eighth-inning extra base hit.\n\nAnd the Nationals claimed a 3-1 victory that gave them a 2-0 NLCS edge on the Cardinals, with Game 3 at Nationals Park on Monday night.\n\nSure, they\u2019ll start another ace in Stephen Strasburg, who will battle Cardinals No. 1 man Jack Flaherty. But at this point, kismet may matter as much as Ks for a team that has won six of eight playoff games since facing a 3-1, eighth-inning deficit in the NL knockout match against Milwaukee.\n\nThey roared back to win that game and survived two elimination games against the mighty Dodgers.\n\nAnd now?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this weird feeling that comes over the dugout, comes over the bullpen, in the sixth, seventh inning of games,\u201d says Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle, who recorded seven crucial late-inning outs in Games 1 and 2. \u201cWhen the game is close, the game is hanging in the balance, we\u2019re finding ways to push runs across, like we did last night, like we did today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really cool.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the exact opposite of this team\u2019s identity in May, when their bullpen beyond Doolittle was in tatters and a 19-31 start appeared to doom them.\n\nAt that point, they\u2019d suffered 11 losses when blowing a lead in the seventh inning or later.\n\nNow? They own the eighth inning \u2013 a three-run rally to topple the Brewers 4-3, a two-homer salvo to erase another 3-1 deficit against the Dodgers in the decisive NLDS Game 5, and two runs Saturday that proved decisive.\n\nOverall, they are 80-40 since May 23 (a .666 clip), including 6-2 this postseason.\n\nOne sample size is massive. The other is small. But both square with what\u2019s unfolded on the field \u2013 and with what\u2019s now at stake.\n\nGAME 2: Scherzer dominates Cardinals\n\nWELCOME BACK: Closer returns to Nats: 'Life comes at you fast'\n\nGAME 1: Unheralded Nats pitcher delivers first NLCS win\n\n\u201cWhen you catch a break like we did in the wild-card game, you start to feel like,\u201d says Doolittle, before pausing and perhaps catching himself, \u201c... you start to play with so much confidence, because you never feel like you\u2019re out of a game.\n\n\u201cWhen our starting pitching is doing what it\u2019s been able to do, giving us a chance to win every night, going deep into games, I feel like everybody\u2019s playing with this calm confidence that we\u2019re going to find a way to win.\u201d\n\nYeah, the pitching\u2019s been OK.\n\nScherzer, the three-time Cy Young Award winner making his fourth playoff appearance, struggled with a high pitch count early but held St. Louis hitless into the seventh, when Goldschmidt cleanly singled in front of Juan Soto.\n\nA night earlier, a pinch-hit single by Jose Martinez with two outs in the eighth was all that kept Sanchez from a bid at history.\n\nProbably a relief overall for manager Dave Martinez, who didn\u2019t have to fret over a pair of 1-0 playoff leads clashing with the historic opportunities Scherzer and Sanchez had.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time \u2013 in 2013, as Detroit Tigers, they had a nearly duplicate scenario, holding the Boston Red Sox hitless in Game 1 and 2 starts before a high pitch count claimed Sanchez after six innings and Scherzer gave up a single with two outs in the sixth the next night.\n\nNew league, new team, same result. And the Cardinals are bearing the brunt \u2013 their starting eight position players have a combined two hits in 54 at-bats \u2013 just one off Nationals starters.\n\n\u201cI know when Sanchie gets locked in, he\u2019s nasty,\u201d Scherzer said Saturday. \u201cHe can absolutely do anything with the baseball. He\u2019s such a treat to watch.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m just in the moment. I\u2019m not trying to do anything great.\u201d\n\nThat goes for the whole team \u2013 going on five months now and eight scintillating playoff games.\n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d says Scherzer, \"it just seems like anybody who gets their number called is going to do something big.\u201d\n\nIn the small picture - and now, in a very big one.", "description": "The Nationals were four outs from being eliminated from the playoffs 11 days ago.
