It announced that the law banning face masks designed to stop the recent violence in the city would take effect starting at midnight on Friday. The ban would be imposed through legislation under the emergency law.\n\nIt stated that anyone who uses masks to conceal their identities at any legal or unlawful public gatherings and meetings will be in breach of the law. To avoid the risk of committing an offence, students are advised not to cover their faces in any way when they are out on the streets.\n\nThe letter also stated that students students have no need to cover their faces for any reason in or out of schools, except for religious or health purposes.\n\nWhat are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\nStudent reactions to the new law were mixed.\n\nYing Wa College student Argus Lam told Young Post that the enforcement of the Emergency Law \u201creally worried\u201d him. \u201cFor me, it represents the crumbling of the separation of powers currently implemented in Hong Kong,\u201d the 17-year-old said. \u201cThis colonial-era law grants the Chief Executive Carrie Lam unprecedented power: She can enact any sort of law, including confiscating property of Hongkongers.\u201d\n\nA young protester wears a Guy Fawkes mask in Hong Kong.

He added that giving Lam the power to enact the emergency law, a colonial-era law, is no different to imposing martial law in the city. He also said that the concern group was planning on boycotting classes or staging a silent rally outside school on Tuesday to protest against the new legislation.\n\nHong Kong protests explained: A guide to the key words you see in the news\n\nThe regulation also applies to all teaching staff and school employees, including instructors for extra-curricular activities and service providers that are sent to schools.\n\nIf students and teaching staff are feeling unwell, they are advised to stay at home or seek medical help as soon as possible. The Education Bureau also urges schools to set up their own measures based on the new regulations.\n\nOn page three of the document, there is also a sample of notice to parents regarding the imminent enforcement of the anti-mask law. It calls on the parents to remind their children not to cover their faces when they go out.\n\nParents are also asked to lead by example, and admonish their children to not participate in any activities that might be illegal or involve dangerous situations.\n\nThere's also a sample reply slip that a parent signature to acknowledge they've read the letter on the last page.", "description": "Education Bureau sent info about new anti-mask law to all schools as Carrie Lam held press conference to introduce the legislation to the public.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/scmp_17jun19_ns_protest21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
