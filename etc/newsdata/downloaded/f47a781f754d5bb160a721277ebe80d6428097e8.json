The doctors treated Gordon at Atlanta Medical Center, where she had gone after complaining of headaches, memory loss and difficulty communicating.\n\nOn Thursday, 39-year-old Jerrontae Cain was sentenced to 25 years in prison connection with the shooting.\n\nCOPS: TEXAS MAN FATALLY SHOT BURGLAR AND WENT BACK TO BED BEFORE CALLING 911\n\nGordon told police she didn't remember being shot but did remember an argument with Cain during which her car window shattered and she passed out.\n\nShe thought she was hurt by broken glass and was patched up at the home of Cain's mother.\n\n\u201cAt no point during the month between the fight with Cain and her eventual visit to Atlanta Medical Center did Gordon receive any professional care,\u201d Howard said in a statement, which accused Cain of hiding Gordon at his mother\u2019s house all that time.\n\nCHICAGO POLICE CAPTURE SUSPECT IN SHOOTINGS THAT WOUNDED OFFICER, WOMAN\n\nStaff at Atlanta Medical Center contacted the police after discovering the bullet. Cain told cops Gordon hurt herself when she crashed her car into a tree, shattering glass.\n\n\u201cThe crime scene proved to be inconsistent with Cain\u2019s explanation, and doctors determined that the injuries Gordon suffered were consistent with being shot in the head,\u201d Howard said. A warrant was issued for Cain's arrest, but he was not taken into custody until January of this year, following a two-hour standoff at a home in suburban College Park.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to Howard, doctors say the bullet will have to remain in Gordon's skull because they fear that any attempt to remove it will kill her. Gordon's friends testified at trial that Cain had abused her in the past, leaving bruises and black eyes \"on several different occasions.\"\n\nCain was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated battery, and weapons charges. He was previously convicted of sexual battery in 2010 and faces a first-degree burglary charge in a separate Fulton County case.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution was the first to report on the case.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Georgia\u00a0woman was shot\u00a0in the head by her boyfriend, but didn't realize what had happened to her for more than a month, prosecutors said.", "authors": ["Robert Gearty"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Jerrontae-Cain-FBI-Atlanta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
