It's how the company is attempting to grow in the future, offering more premium products, smaller packaging where consumers tend to consume drinks.\"\n\nCoke Zero Sugar had another quarter of double-digit volume growth and 7.5-ounce mini cans of soda grew by 15%.", "description": "Coca-Cola shares rallied after its latest earnings report Friday, and the highly anticipated launch of a Red Bull, Monster Beverage energy drink competitor is coming.", "authors": ["Cnbc.Com Staff", "Amelia Lucas"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106189442-1571397365466gettyimages-585759184.jpeg?v=1571384492", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
