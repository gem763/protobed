The Houston Chronicle and its partner Politifact Texas reported last night that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim that \u201cI\u2019m not talking about confiscating anybody\u2019s guns\u201d is a flat-out lie. The rating from Politifact is a week old, but the Chronicle is making sure that Texas voters didn\u2019t miss it (via our colleague Karen Townsend):\n\nThe claim: \u201cI\u2019m not talking about confiscating anybody\u2019s guns.\u201d \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Democratic presidential contender. O\u2019Rourke made the statement on Oct. 16 on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d responding to the opening question from co-host Joe Scarborough. PolitiFact ruling: False. O\u2019Rourke has said \u201cyes\u201d and \u201chell, yes\u201d when asked about confiscating assault-style weapons. And his mandatory buyback proposes taking those weapons from people, even if it involves a purchase.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has a larger problem with truth when it comes to gun control, which we have covered at length this cycle. That\u2019s especially the case with Beto\u2019s half-baked proposal for mandatory gun buybacks, which for some reason never implicates the threat of force in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mind. It certainly does for others, as the word \u201cmandatory\u201d clearly expresses legal and/or physical force for compliance.\n\nUsually O\u2019Rourke just elides over that point, but in this Morning Joe exchange on October 16th, he falsely denied it while never explaining how his program would succeed without forced confiscation. The lie comes in the first minute of the interview:\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not talking about confiscating anybody\u2019s guns. But I do think that, for those weapons of war \u2014 AR-15s, AK-47s \u2014 these were designed and sold to the militaries of the world to kill people on a battlefield and there are more than 16 million of them in America. And we\u2019ve seen the devastating effect that they can have in Dayton, Ohio, or El Paso, Texas, or Odessa, not too far from where I live. Those must be bought back or else each of them are an instrument potentially of terror in this country.\n\nAnd to his credit, Joe Scarborough didn\u2019t exactly let O\u2019Rourke off the hook here, either. He asks Beto what would happen if people chose not to obey his mandatory-confiscation law, which O\u2019Rourke dodged by claiming that people would follow laws even when they disagree with them, a point to which we will return in a moment. Scarborough keeps pressing:\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Okay, but let\u2019s just assume there\u2019s a rancher in Texas that doesn\u2019t, that says \u2018I\u2019m not going to do this because this is an unjust law and it\u2019s unconstitutional.\u2019 What\u2019s the next step? I think that\u2019s what we need to concede because there will be people who don\u2019t turn the guns in. What\u2019s the next step for the federal government there? O\u2019ROURKE: Yeah, I think just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law. So in that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.\n\nWhat does one call an operation where law enforcement forces entry to seize weapons? Confiscation. Even if the confiscatee, so to speak, gets a check for his trouble, the weapon has been seized, not \u201cbought back.\u201d \u201cBought\u201d implies a consensual commercial transaction, not a trade made at gunpoint.\n\nBut this won\u2019t be necessary, O\u2019Rourke claims, because he has \u201cfaith\u201d that his fellow Americans will respect his mandatory buyback and fully comply with the law:\n\nO\u2019ROURKE: But my faith is in this country and in my fellow Americans following the law, and listening to people who own AK-47s and AR-15s who concede they don\u2019t need it for self-protection, they don\u2019t need it to hunt. It\u2019s real true purpose and use is on a battlefield.\n\nExcuse me? If all Americans fully complied with the law, we would have no need for this conversation or gun control at all. The only reason for gun control is gun crime, which is by definition a percentage of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fellow Americans not following the law. Murder has been against the law at least since Moses came down from the mountain, and that was an actual law of faith.\n\nStick with the rest of the interview to be reminded that O\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t have any idea what the statistics of gun crime actually are or say, but we knew that much already. The larger point here is that anything mandated by law eventually has to be enforced with government power, and that involves the threat of violence. In its original \u201cLie\u201d assessment, Politifact makes the obvious point even obvious enough for Beto to grasp it:\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable to call what Mr. O\u2019Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation,\u201d gun law expert George Mocsary, a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told PolitiFact. \u201cImagine the situation when an owner of one of the weapons refuses to sell. He or she is issued a fine. The owner still has the weapon, however. Does paying the fine mean that he or she can now keep the weapon and it is perfectly legal? Certainly not,\u201d Mocsary said. \u201cThere is no scenario under which the owner of one of the designated weapons gets to keep it. That is confiscation.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s so obvious that the Houston Chronicle feels compelled to share it with its readers today. Good luck with that political career in Texas once you disappear from the national stage, Beto.", "description": "\"It is unreasonable to call what Mr. O\u2019Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/beto-memememe.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
