Shifts in rainfall across the region led to three waves of migration 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by corridors of green fertile land opening up.\n\nImage copyright Chris Bennett, Evolving Picture, Sydney, Australia Image caption Prof Hayes learning how to make fire with Jul'hoansi hunters in the greater Kalahari of Namibia\n\nThe first migrants ventured north-east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south-west and a third population remained in the homeland until today.\n\nThis scenario is based on tracing back the human family tree using hundreds of samples of mitochondrial DNA (the scrap of DNA that passes down the maternal line from mother to child) from living Africans.\n\nBy combining genetics with geology and climate computer model simulations, researchers were able to paint a picture of what the African continent might have been like 200,000 years ago.\n\nReconstructing the human story\n\nHowever, the study, published in the journal Nature, was greeted with caution by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from mitochondrial DNA alone.\n\nOther analyses have produced different answers with fossil discoveries hinting at an eastern African origin.\n\nProf Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, who is not connected with the study, said the evolution of Homo sapiens was a complex process.\n\n\"You can't use modern mitochondrial distributions on their own to reconstruct a single location for modern human origins,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I think it's over-reaching the data because you're only looking at one tiny part of the genome so it cannot give you the whole story of our origins.\"\n\nThus, there could have been many homelands, rather than one, which have yet to be pinned down.\n\nEvolutionary milestones in human history\n\n400,000 years ago: Neanderthals - our evolutionary cousins - begin to appear and move across Europe and Asia\n\n300,000 to 200,000 years ago:Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa\n\n50,000 to 40,000 years ago: Modern humans reach Europe.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "description": "Scientists say the possible homeland of all humans alive today is an area south of the Zambesi River.", "authors": ["Helen", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16E93/production/_109434839_gettyimages-965711708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
