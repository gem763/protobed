She had been robbed.\n\nFour months earlier, in September 2017, Liszanckie\u2019s business, Plantworks, had joined the thousand-plus other \u201cproducer-processors\u201d licensed to supply Washington\u2019s burgeoning trade in recreational marijuana. She and her partner set out to grow high-end \u201ccraft\u201d weed in 2,500 square feet of an anonymous industrial strip in Seattle\u2019s North End. On the night of the break-in in January 2018, Plantworks had a full crop\u201426 pounds of high-quality dried, cured flower, worth about $52,000\u2014ready to deliver to local cannabis shops.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe thieves, recounts Liszanckie, bypassed the live plants and headed straight for the ready-to-sell stock, cleaning it out. It was devastating.\n\nLiszanckie asked around and discovered she was just one in a rash of growers in and around Seattle who\u2019ve suffered similar break-ins, six of whom consented to be interviewed for this article. Their accounts followed a pattern: The burglars came in the wee hours and speedily cut the electricity to the security cameras and alarms. Sometimes they smashed through walls to get in, avoiding the alarms on the doors. Because even the legal grow operations tend to be unsigned and inconspicuously located in small warehouses and industrial strips, the noise went unnoticed. And the burglars chose their targets well: Bypassing large grow operations with highly secure, purpose-built facilities, they hit smaller, more vulnerable growers producing high-end, easy-to-move weed.\n\nThe robbers also showed an uncanny sense of timing, striking just as the growers had amassed inventories of cut, cured, ready-to-sell product worth thousands, even tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe growers began posting news of the heists on Instagram, swapping conjectures as to how the burglars knew where and when to strike. Two hypotheses emerged. The first: that an employee at a retail pot shop was either involved in the break-ins or telling the burglars whom to hit.\n\nBut as the burglaries continued, the growers came to suspect that the criminals had found another way of getting the information they needed to target vulnerable businesses offering big payoffs: The government was giving it to them.\n\nIllustrations by Owen Freeman\n\nAfter Washington\u2019s residents became the first in the nation (together with Colorado\u2019s) to vote to legalize recreational marijuana sales and possession in 2012, the state liquor board, newly renamed the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board (WLCB) adopted exhaustive rules and regulations to govern the new trade. These require that cannabis producers and processors provide much more detailed information about their activities to the state each month than other businesses are obliged to provide\u2014things like exactly how many plants they grow and harvest by batch and strain, how much inventory they hold and how much they sell, when, to whom, for how much. Whenever they transport product, they must file cargo manifests with detailed vehicle information. \u201cWe plant a seed, we report it,\u201d Liszanckie says. \u201cYou take a cutting, you report it. How long you dry. What the final weight was. How soon did it go out door? What did you sell, who did you sell it to, for how much? What did they mark it up to? Easily 25 percent of our time is given over to tracking.\u201d\n\nThe state and state-licensed data firms then post much of this information online, where it is available to the public.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis Cannabis is one of the fastest growing industries in the country. It cuts across dozens of other industries\u2014from health care to agriculture, law enforcement to hospitality. What happens next will affect our jobs, our health, and our future. POLITICO Pro Cannabis will fill the need for high-quality, credentialed and balanced coverage of the cannabis industry and public policy efforts.

For all the state\u2019s talk of transparency, local law enforcement and the WLCB told me they don\u2019t track cumulative data on marijuana thefts. My ongoing public disclosure request for case files from thefts and robberies at licensed cannabis businesses in Seattle has so far turned up 54 from 2016 to 2018, but this list is far from complete. It includes only crimes against retail vendors, not growers, so it does not include about one dozen burglaries suffered by growers interviewed for this story, all of whom say they called the police and have yet to see any perpetrators apprehended. Last year, in a disclosure not intended for public consumption, Seattle Police detective Nick Kartes attested in a sworn certificate of probable cause filed against one of the few local cannabis burglars to be caught and prosecuted that in 2017 alone, \u201cSeattle Police had more than 65 reported burglaries to marijuana shops.\u201d (Kartes and Seattle Police burglary- and narcotics-unit commanders declined requests for comment.)\n\nMeanwhile, the thefts have continued into this year\u2014and Washington is grappling with a puzzle that will haunt other states as legal marijuana expands: How to bring transparency, accountability and security to an industry that has been covert and illicit for most of its history\u2014and that still fuels a lucrative black market in most of the country. Washington regulators say they are committed to enforcing transparency in a trade that is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government. But in the process, the state might be turning its legitimate vendors into targets for bad actors who have a huge incentive to exploit the rules and just grab the goods.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWashington officials knew they were charting new territory when they opened up a legal market for an expensive product that was still illegal under federal law and in most other states. \u201cClearly, the world is watching the states of Colorado and Washington as their initiatives are implemented,\u201d Governor Jay Inslee wrote to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in February 2013. \u201cWe intend to do it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have the federal government let the legislation go forth,\u201d recalls Alison Holcomb, the ACLU of Washington\u2019s political director, who played a central role in passing the legalization initiative and drafting the legislation that implemented it. \u201cWe did not want to create an antagonistic relationship between the state and the federal government.\u201d And so, at the legislature\u2019s direction, the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board set out to draft stringent rules, eliminating the ambiguities and loopholes that had dogged the state\u2019s 14-year experiment with legal medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cTraceability\u201d and \u201ctransparency\u201d are the watchwords of the state\u2019s \u201cseed to sale\u201d system. These regulations are intended to ensure that consumers know what\u2019s in their weed and where it comes from, and that producers, processors and retailers safeguard quality, pay the state\u2019s 37 percent cannabis excise tax (plus sales tax of about 10 percent) and don\u2019t sneak product out to sell it on the untaxed black market. Toward that end, growers are also required to install video cameras around their premises\u2014not for security but to monitor their own activities\u2014and save recordings for 45 days.\n\nIllustration by Owen Freeman\n\nMuch of this information is not only reportable to regulators but also available to the public. The state posts the locations of all marijuana vendors and producers and detailed monthly sales data. Private data-aggregating firms such as 502 Data and Top Shelf Data (slogan: \u201cKnow Everything About Any Cannabis Business in Washington\u201d) assemble that information, obtain additional harvest and inventory data via monthly public disclosure requests, add maps and other publicly available data, and post it all in easily digestible and searchable form. The full results, available to paid subscribers, make it easy to track the growers\u2019 planting, growing and processing cycles.\n\nThe growers use these services to track market trends and check up on customers and competitors. But some have come to realize that, like Facebook users, they\u2019re the product as well as the customers, and they should worry about who\u2019s tracking them. \u201cI used Top Shelf Data,\u201d Liszanckie says. \u201cI was shocked how much information I could find. It\u2019s linked to Secretary of State records, Department of Revenue records, personal information you could glean.\u201d Top Shelf Data did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWashington also collects data that are not posted online, either by the WLCB or by private firms, but that can be accessed with a public information request\u2014for example the models of vehicles used to transport cannabis and their license and vehicle identification numbers.\n\nDetailed floor plans showing where plants are grown, inventory is stored and security cameras are located as well as delivery-route manifests\u2014a potential road map for robbers\u2014are collected but not released, not even with a public disclosure request.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

In February 2018, hackers broke into the state\u2019s then-new marijuana traceability system, LEAF Data Systems, operated by the contractor MJ Freeway and adopted after technical issues dogged WLCB\u2019s first traceability system and the next contractor selected to design a system bowed out of the project. The hackers, who weren\u2019t caught, disrupted the transfer of required shipment information, temporarily paralyzing the trade, and stole the traceability database, including vehicle identifications and route maps. Even after this leak was stanched, implementation of the reporting system has remained rocky; more than a year later, the Liquor and Cannabis Board acknowledged that there were still about 150 known bugs in the Leaf software. Last month, a botched attempt to update the complicated software rendered it effectively unusable, paralyzing the industry again. An official assessment found that MJ Freeway argued for proceeding with the update even though WLCB feared it wasn\u2019t ready, causing elevated risks and \u201csignificant functional, data-integrity, and system-performance issues.\u201d In a statement, MJ Freeway said the state didn\u2019t alert the company of significant issues that would have affected the update. Smith says the LEAF system was down for just \u201cthree to four days.\u201d Liszanckie says her operation \u201clost 21 days of total revenue in July\u201d because of the \u201chopelessly, utterly, maddeningly broken\u201d traceability system.\n\nTheft-shocked growers have seized on this system\u2014even without the hack\u2014as a huge vulnerability, exposing them to unwanted attention from criminals. \u201cShout out the #WSLCB for making our addresses public,\u201d one Seattle producer, Alex Prindle, posted on Instagram, together with alarming security-camera footage of a masked, machete-wielding burglar in the process of plundering what he says was about $200,000 worth of weed from his company, Fire Bros. \u201cA quick Google search will give any solicitor and criminal the location of every cannabis business in the state. Why? I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s how this crew has knocked down so many Seattle spots.\u201d Fire Bros. went on to offer a $20,000 reward, still unpaid, for information leading to the culprits.\n\nIllustration by Owen Freeman\n\n\u201cIt still baffles me why [regulators] post that information,\u201d says Spencer Schrote, whose Tacoma grow business, Royal Tree Gardens, got hit by burglars who came through a roof and cut through a wall but fled after an alarm went off. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge security risk for us to have that out in the public domain. It puts a target on our backs. It makes things less safe.\u201d\n\nIf following the law turns growers into targets, then they have an incentive to not follow the law, or at least fudge some reporting requirements. There\u2019s no known evidence that any Washington growers have done that. But James Schwartz, a licensed grower in neighboring Oregon, worries about supplying the detailed delivery-route manifests, \u201cwith every single stop and time,\u201d which his state, like Washington, requires of growers but does not release to the public. \u201cThat could just sit on some desk where the wrong eyes could see it,\u201d he says. So instead of supplying the required route details, \u201cI just refer them to Google Maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably wise to do that,\u201d says Philip Dawdy, a veteran marijuana business consultant in Seattle, recalling the panic in the trade last year after the hackers stole Washington growers\u2019 route manifests.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhen they decry the disclosures of their information, the aggrieved growers are setting themselves against not just what they see as detached and unresponsive regulators but against a state that prides itself on open government and strong public disclosure laws. \u201cWashington is a sunshine state, perhaps the most open in the nation,\u201d says Brian Smith, the WLCB\u2019s public information director, who has worked at the commission since the dawn of legalization. \u201cWhen we started out, we were bombarded with public disclosure requests by reporters, by people concerned about marijuana in their community,\u201d and by those trying to get into the industry who wanted to know what others were up to.\n\nThe growers\u2019 addresses, sales and other data are \u201call public information for which there is a lot of public interest,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cPeople in communities want to know if there\u2019s a grow operation near them. Cities want to know where they are. To go forward under a federally illegal product, Washington has to demonstrate that it\u2019s carrying out a system that is responsible to the needs of the state, not just to the businesses involved.\u201d\n\nSmith brushes aside the growers\u2019 fears that they\u2019re being targeted through the information the state collects and posts. Burglary \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s much there.\u201d\n\nHe notes that the WLCB also posts the locations of alcohol vendors. He suggests that the growers have no basis for complaining about the state posting their addresses and sales data when they have websites promoting their products: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can draw any correlation between an address being known and a business becoming a target. These are businesses. They want to be known. They put themselves out there\u201d\u2014just like the liquor vendors the state also regulates. The growers counter that they promote their products to others in the pot business, not the public, and don\u2019t disclose their locations. And supermarkets and distillers don\u2019t carry a highly desirable, easily transportable product that sells illicitly for $3,000 a pound or more in the 39 states that have not legalized recreational marijuana.\n\nFurthermore, says Smith, providing the sales data is a requirement of local banks\u2014which are allowed to serve the Washington cannabis industry, unlike their counterparts in most other states that have legalized cannabis\u2014in order to make sure deposits match reported sales and receipts from illicit sales don\u2019t get laundered. (It\u2019s a requirement, along with higher fees, that banks impose on cannabis businesses but not others.) Smith argues that the transparency is one of the reasons Washington banks were more receptive to serving this businesses\u2014and why their counterparts in other states with legal sales haven\u2019t lobbied for that right\u2014a trend confirmed by Dylan Sheji, legal team manager at CannaRegs, a Denver firm that compiles and analyzes states\u2019 cannabis-industry regulations.\n\nIllustration by Owen Freeman\n\n\u201cFederal prohibition and the lack of traditional banking services have created the largest security risk for cannabis businesses\u201d nationwide, says Sheji: Lacking bank accounts, growers and retailers are forced to hold large stashes of cash on premises, a magnet for thieves and robbers. This appears not to be the case in Seattle, where growers can use banks. In nearly all of a sample of 40-plus burglaries documented at local growers and retailers, cannabis rather than cash was the target.\n\nStill, Sheji notes that \u201cWashington is an outlier\u201d in the amount of information it collects and releases about cannabis businesses. Other states get by, and seem to escape the wrath of the feds, with less \u201ctransparency\u201d\u2014in the case of neighboring Oregon, much less.\n\nColorado posts the addresses of cannabis growers as well as vendors, but does not release individual sales data or business and security layouts, even with a disclosure request. Oregon, likewise, does not release individual sales data\u2014and posts addresses only for cannabis retailers and testing labs. According to Mark Pettinger, a spokesperson for the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, legislators opted to exempt producers, processors and wholesalers because \u201cwe heard from them and from law enforcement that releasing that information could make them targets.\u201d\n\nWhen burglaries do happen in Oregon, says Pettinger, they seem to involve insiders\u2014angry ex-employees or partners, or casual workers hired to trim buds. Law enforcement figures in Washington often suggest that heists there are also inside jobs, with the imputation that the owners are partly to blame for trusting the wrong people. Liszanckie heard it when she reported the burglary at Plantworks but says it doesn\u2019t wash: Insiders \u201cwould not spend the time to bust through doors to the live plant rooms, then leave the rooms untouched in search of finished product.\u201d And there are no susceptible insiders anyway: \u201cThe only workers are the owners.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nRipoffs aren\u2019t a new phenomenon in the weed trade, in Seattle or elsewhere. Illicit grow operations have long been plagued by robberies. But legalization was supposed to make things safer, for producers as well as consumers, by bringing the industry out of the underworld and into the legal light of day. Some supporters of legalization, including two former U.S. attorneys in Seattle, argued that legalization could even spur a drop in overall crime as police reallocated resources spent enforcing marijuana prohibition to solving other crimes. Others contended that making marijuana more readily available would reduce violent crime by drawing users away from drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine, because marijuana users are less prone to violence than meth and crack users are.\n\nEarly research post-legalization suggested these promises were panning out, at least at a broad level. A 2018 study in Police Quarterly suggested that legalization has led to more cases of some types of crime being solved. Another study found \u201ca significant reduction in rapes and property crimes\u201d in Washington state after legalization, even before the first retail stores opened. And another concluded that legalizing medical marijuana in many states starting in the 1990s led to a general reduction in violent crime in the U.S. states bordering Mexico, apparently by undercutting traffickers there.\n\nThe picture is rather different for burglaries and robberies within the marijuana trade, though\u2014and not just in Washington. The Atlantic recently reported that \u201cdope rips,\u201d thefts of processed marijuana, have actually increased after legalization in Northern California\u2019s pot-growing \u201cEmerald Triangle.\u201d In Colorado, Denver saw its own surge in crime. \u201cIn 2017, we saw seven homicides directly related to illegal sale and cultivation,\u201d Lieutenant Andrew Howard of the Denver Police Department\u2019s Vice and Narcotics Section said in a 2018 video. \u201cIn 2016, we had well over 100 burglaries at licensed retail and grow locations.\u201d In response, said Howard, Denver police prioritized crimes at the licensed businesses, assigning two detectives to them and working closely with owners to improve lighting and security systems. As a result, the number of burglaries declined \u201cby more than half.\u201d\n\nData on marijuana-related crime are much harder to come by in Seattle. While Denver maintains and posts a comprehensive database of marijuana-related crimes, excluding illegal possession and sale, the Seattle Police Department says it does not track these separately from general burglaries and robberies.\n\nWhen I asked law enforcement and crime-analysis agencies, from city police departments to the Washington State Patrol and state Office of Financial Management, for this sort of data on cannabis thefts, all referred me to the state Liquor and Cannabis Board. But the WLCB doesn\u2019t cumulatively track this data either. The board does require that growers immediately report any of their production that gets lost, ruined or stolen. But, says its spokesman Brian Smith, it treats burglaries and other diversions to the illicit market as \u201cone-offs.\u201d They\u2019re \u201creported to our traceability system. But we don\u2019t tabulate any cumulative data on them.\u201d In other words, theft and loss reports are digitally filed away, rather than compiled to provide data that might help law enforcement and policy makers assess and address such crimes\u2014or to tally how much and what kinds of marijuana are diverted to illicit markets in other states. Staffing levels may have something to do with this inaction. The WLCB has a team of just 18, including six enforcement officers, to monitor more than 1,000 cannabis growers WLCB rules require that they report the loss immediately (formerly 1,400, before a market shakeout began); a larger cohort oversees alcohol and cannabis vendors. The producers say the inspectors assigned to them are overwhelmed and, in the words of one grower, \u201cover their heads.\u201d\n\nIllustration by Owen Freeman\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavy workload,\u201d Smith acknowledges. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for more resources\u201d\u2014despite the fact that the state collected $367 million in marijuana taxes and fees in the last fiscal year, 74 percent more than it collected for alcohol and tobacco together.\n\n\n\n***\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 2018, Larry Perrigo, who operates Saints Joints in Seattle\u2019s Georgetown industrial district, got a call from his alarm company. He says he called the police, raced down and scared off two or three intruders who\u2019d smashed through his building\u2019s back door, ripped out the alarms and pulled up a few plants. Later that night, with the alarms still disabled, the thieves returned, burrowed through a wall, and took a full crop, about 40 pounds of cured weed worth a little less than $60,000.\n\nIn February, what Perrigo believes was the same crew returned. They smashed through a different stucco wall, spray-painted the security cameras, and stole another 40-pound crop. In May, thieves struck in similar fashion across the state, at a Spokane producer called Panoptic, which did not respond to a request for comment but posted video of the heist on Instagram. Others in the trade commiserated. \u201cTime to move location,\u201d one self-described \u201cgreenhouse guru\u201d posted. \u201cThanks lcb for making [cannabis growers\u2019] addresses public record.\u201d\n\nOn July 5, thieves broke into Seattle\u2019s Fire Bros. yet again. \u201cIt seems to be a more professional bunch, as they were in and out in under four minutes,\u201d says Marris. It did not seem to be an inside job: \u201cWe have a pretty tight-knit group of employees. The burglars broke into areas that did not contain anything valuable. That would indicate they were coming in blind.\u201d Nevertheless, he says, they escaped with 14 bins of weed at various stages of production.\n\nTheft losses put smaller growers like Marris, Perrigo and Liszanckie at further disadvantage against the larger operations that are seizing an ever bigger share of the market. These can afford 24-hour security and isolated, hardened facilities, unlike the frame and stucco warehouse units the smaller ones typically occupy. The state\u2019s largest, Northwest Cannabis Solutions, co-founded by the scion of a wealthy Russian fishing clan, has national ambitions and what the trade journal Marijuana Venture describes as 100,000 square feet of production space with 44 grow rooms tended by \u201ca small army of white-suited workers.\u201d\n\nThe small growers also typically lack insurance against theft. The few companies that will insure cannabis businesses\u2014Lloyd\u2019s is one\u2014require that they store their product in safes. \u201cYou\u2019d literally have to have a bank vault,\u201d Marris says. \u201cSome of the big companies can afford them\u2014they spend $500,000 to build them.\u201d\n\nAnd now, there might be some hope for frustrated growers who have yet to see any burglars apprehended. Despite the WLCB\u2019s and Seattle Police\u2019s lack of interest or capacity for tracking cannabis diversion, one agency seems to be paying attention. The Washington State Patrol recently established two specialized Marijuana Enforcement Teams with 10 officers between them for the stated purpose \u201cof controlling the potential diversion and illicit production or distribution of marijuana and marijuana-related products.\u201d Their commander, Lieutenant James Prouty, says the teams are \u201cin the process of creating databases that will allow us to accurately track [diversion] activity.\u201d\n\nBut even so, the legal growers fear theft losses will remain a cost of doing business. \u201cWe\u2019ve just accepted it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d says Royal Tree\u2019s Spencer Schrote, \u201cbecause of the state of the industry and the amount of public data that\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Legislature could follow Oregon\u2019s lead and adopt an exemption from public records law limiting the data released on producers and processors. The ACLU\u2019s Alison Holcomb thinks it\u2019s time to look at that: \u201cThe legislature should give serious consideration to whether some appropriate exemptions from the Public Records Act should be implemented\u201d\u2014 as it would \u201canytime public safety is at risk.\u201d\n\nEven if Washington followed Oregon\u2019s lead and tried to shield the growers, Larry Perrigo fears that thefts and diversions would continue: \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen in every single state [that legalizes marijuana]. As long as it\u2019s illegal somewhere, people will steal it to sell there. As soon as there\u2019s full legalization nationwide, this will all go away.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect MJ Freeway\u2019s statement about the July update of LEAF Data Systems.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said LEAF Data Systems \u201ccollapsed\u201d and \u201ccrashed\u201c in July. In fact, significant problems made the newly updated system effectively unusable, and it had to be taken down. An earlier version of the story said that MJ Freeway \u201cinsisted\" the state proceed with the update; MJ Freeway recommended the state proceed.
