The agreement is named after the current German president, who proposed it as a solution to the war in eastern Ukraine that has killed 13,000 people and counting.\n\nThe Russian regime has very few legitimate soldiers in the region, instead depending on its proxy militias and guerrilla forces to kill Ukrainian soldiers. Protesters expressed concern that Russia would withdraw only its official soldiers and leave the guerrillas there to intimidate the population to vote for autonomy from Kyiv. Donetsk and Luhansk are currently operating as semi-autonomous special regions, but the law that allows for that expires at the end of the year.\n\nRussia denies having soldiers in Donbas, leaving unclear how they would be able to withdraw their forces without admitting to lying.\n\nZelensky has vowed that he will not move forward with elections if any Russian forces remain in the area.\n\n\u201cThere cannot be and will not be elections held at gunpoint,\u201d Zelenskiy said on October 2, the day after agreeing to the deal. \u201cThere will be no capitulation.\u201d\n\nIf Donbas holds an election and votes to become a special autonomous region, Kyiv\u2019s lawmakers would have to vote to amend the constitution to make it happen. Zelensky\u2019s party, Servant of the People \u2013 named after the comedy show he starred in before becoming president \u2013 does not have the majority necessary to pass an amendment and it is unclear whether more established interests would vote with the party.\n\nThe protesters said they did not believe Zelensky\u2019s promise of not holding elections under violent circumstances and that being open to the deal at all was a sign of surrender.\n\n\u201cHolding elections in the occupied territories is inappropriate because people there have been under occupation and intensive propaganda for five years,\u201d protester Dmytro Horyslavets told the Kyiv Post.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t fight with the occupants for five years just to surrender now. It\u2019s a disgrace. We won\u2019t allow it,\u201d another protester identified as the mother of a Ukrainian soldier who died in Donbas, told the newspaper.\n\nProtesters held signs referencing Zelensky\u2019s past career and demanding \u201cno surrender\u201d to Putin.\n\nWhile the Kyiv Post notes that the group organizing the protest (and others in 33 cities), the \u201cResistance to Capitulation Movement,\u201d describes itself as \u201cnon-partisan,\u201d the protest boasted a significant presence of individuals affiliated with the political parties that Zelensky defeated, including, prominently, Poroshenko himself. Following the announcement that Zelensky had agreed to the Steinmeier formula, Poroshenko condemned the move.\n\n\u201cThe signing of the Russia-authored formula [\u2026] de facto means an easing or even lifting of the sanctions against Russia,\u201d Poroshenko\u2019s political group said in a statement. \u201cWe will never agree to that. We feel solidarity with the present actions and calls heard from among veterans and we will not allow the ruin of the Ukrainian state.\u201d\n\nPoroshenko himself called the Steinmeier formula \u201cPutin\u2019s formula,\u201d a phrase repeated by his supporters at the rally.\n\nPoroshenko was elected in the aftermath of the Euromaidan protests against the pro-Putin leader Viktor Yanukovych, but fell from grace as some within his party turned on what they considered widespread corruption in his administration. Poroshenko appeared to be solidly in re-election territory until Zelensky announced his candidacy on his entertainment company\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve variety program; by April, Zelensky defeated Poroshenko 73 percent to 24 percent.\n\nThe concerns over elections in Donbas are not limited to Zelensky\u2019s political opponents, however. In Luhansk, one of the two provinces of the Donbas region, the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops as part of the deal has inspired some alarm.\n\n\u201cUkraine has withdrawn its troops in Stanytsia Luhanska. Russia has not, and their military forces are still here. Russians are now walking around freely in the gray zone,\u201d local official Serhiy Shakshun said on television Monday. \u201cMoreover, the war is escalating along the entire front line.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople call the administration every day, crying: \u2018How can they take our troops away?\u2019\u201d Shakshun added. \u201cOur men, they say! They don\u2019t refer to them, like before, as the \u2018Ukrainian army.\u2019 They are now \u2018our men!\u2019 And what will happen to us after that? People are really worried.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "At least 10,000 people flooded Kyiv's Independence Square, Ukraine, on Sunday to protest President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173983701-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
