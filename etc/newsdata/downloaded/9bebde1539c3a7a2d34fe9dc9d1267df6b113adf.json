We\u2019re living in the 1920s all over again and we don\u2019t even realize it, and what followed the 1920s was a thing called the Great Depression,\u201d Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman, old The Hill\u2019s Saagar Enjeti.\n\nSanford said in the interview that while he agrees with President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE on most immigration issues and the need to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump has not reduced the national debt or deficit since entering office. He also noted that Trump has not completed the border wall that was a central component of his 2016 White House bid.\n\n\"For all of the banter that\u2019s gone back and forth, he hasn\u2019t gotten it done,\" Sanford said. \"I mean he\u2019s certainly caused a lot of friction, a lot of smoke and fire, but there\u2019s not been an additional mile of wall built. So you have a question of results and you have a question of broken promises with things that are core that are going to materially impact people\u2019s lives.\"\n\nTrump administration officials have acknowledged that a little more than 60 miles of border fencing has been completed between the U.S. and Mexico since Trump took office, with most efforts spent on building barriers in areas where an old border fence already stood.\n\nHowever, the president and his advisors have said that at least 450 miles of border fence will be built by the end of next year.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office also announced Monday that the federal budget deficit for 2019 is estimated at $984 billion, representing 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product and the highest national deficit since 2012, under former President Obama.\n\nThe estimates for the deficit in 2019 is $205 billion higher than it was in 2018.\n\nSanford in his interview with Hill.TV also accused 2020 Democratic presidential candidates of not addressing the fiscal issues impacting Americans across the country with their White House campaigns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running because I think we\u2019re walking our way toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of our nation, and yet remarkably we\u2019re having zero conversation in this presidential cycle about the debt and the deficit and government spending,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Marina Pitofsky", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Mark Sanford\u00a0says in a new interview that the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sanfordmark_102519gn5_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
