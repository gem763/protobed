We sit on a bench.\n\nThe man who begins to talk looks like Jonny Wilkinson and speaks like Jonny Wilkinson. But he says he is not the man who kicked the drop goal that won the Rugby World Cup for England for the first and only time 16 years ago.\n\nJonny Wilkinson admits he is a changed man from the one who tasted World Cup glory in 2003\n\nWilkinson's famous drop-goal in extra-time won a thrilling final against Australia in Sydney\n\nTo Wilkinson's relief, most of that man has gone. 'There is not a huge amount of me left from before,' he says.\n\nFor many, he is still frozen in time in that moment in Sydney in 2003 when he sealed England's greatest rugby triumph, the triumph Eddie Jones' team will try to emulate next week after last night's stunning victory over the All Blacks.\n\nWilkinson is still the most vivid symbol of that triumph, an obsessive genius, an enduring symbol of dedication and sacrifice and selflessness. But if others have frozen him there, Wilkinson, finally, has escaped. In the last 10 years, he has reconstructed himself.\n\nHe has, he says, thrown away the crutch of clinging to an identity as a former rugby player. Four years ago, the last time we spoke, he said he was in the process of 'breaking apart'. Now, he has rebuilt himself psychologically with the same meticulous attention to detail that he devotes to everything in his life.\n\nJONNY ON EDDIE JONES 'The key as a player is always to feel like it's building and it's going somewhere and that there is constant improvement and refinement but that it's been built from the ground up. 'Solid level upon solid level upon solid level. And you stay within the level you're in and then you solidify it and then you move on up. 'That's what I feel has happened with England under Eddie. From a squad perspective, it looks as if they are enormously together and cohesive. 'From a game plan perspective, it looks as if people are sure of what is expected of them. 'And from an expression perspective, it looks like guys are able at the top level to go and be themselves.' Eddie Jones, the Australia coach in 2003, has led England to this year's Rugby World Cup final in Japan\n\n'I'm not an ex-rugby player,' he says, looking down at his t-shirt. 'I don't have this shirt over the top of an England shirt. Taking that England shirt off is the most challenging bit.\n\n'It is very easy to put another shirt on over the top and split yourself in two and to be 50 per cent there and be 50 per cent somewhere else. To take the shirt off fully for a long time is a vulnerable experience. But that's the letting go part.\n\n'Some of it, I was resisting. I didn't want to break apart. I still wanted to walk into a room and for people still to give me that sense of 'you could still play, we'd love to have you out there'.\n\n'Most of it was my own doing. But I was seeking to pull myself apart because I wanted to engage back in life. There is so much I had concluded about life and now I am further down that route.\n\n'It doesn't mean I don't have memories that I can call upon and talk about. I just don't have that kind of self-importance I had before. And believe me, I was self-important.\n\n'In 2003 and around that time, there was always a humility about the way I spoke but without wanting to be too ironic or jokey, it was almost as if I walked off from those interviews celebrating how I was just the most humble guy in the world. It was like, 'Celebrate me for my humility'.'\n\nWilkinson, 40, still exudes humility and there is no sense now that it is an affectation. It is there, most obviously, in his willingness to be open about himself and the mental health issues he has dealt with since he was a child.\n\nWilkinson has been open and honest about various mental health issues since his retirement\n\nIt is there, too, in his determination to psychoanalyse himself exhaustively so he can better explain the stage of his development he has now reached.\n\nHe has always been prone to self-analysis. It is part of what makes him, still, one of the most compelling figures in English sport. It can also make others, more used to clich\u00e9s spilling from the lips of their sports heroes, a little uncomfortable.\n\n'Boy Bonkers', the Observer called him in 2003. Another journalist labelled him 'a basket case'. That language is outmoded now.\n\n'When I talked about breaking apart,' he says, 'it was meant on a deeper level. The only thing preventing me from engaging in life itself was the barrier that I had created. When I remove those barriers, there is no me and life because we are life. And it is just life in life. And it is beautiful.\n\n'You're asking me if I miss playing rugby but I'm here wearing my interview kit which means I am plugged in to this interview. I relate it to a plug in a socket. This interview is the socket. If I can't plug in, that's on me. Not on the socket.\n\n'It's not me talking about how rubbish this is sitting in a park on a beautiful day in Japan exploring concepts because you're holding me back from being in the gym. I became a fixed plug.\n\n'When the socket moves and another one appears, you are desperately trying to plug in but can't so you don't feel charged up or powerful or worthy and then you do everything you can to change the socket, which is stress and suffering because that socket is just perfect how it is. So I don't miss it because I have it. Right now.'\n\nJONNY ON OWEN FARRELL 'I see similarities with me in the fact that he is ruthlessly devoted and driven. He has that clarity of how you see the game. I see a greater openness than I had at that stage. He will continue to grow into the space he finds. 'I found I got more tied up in that whole thing of fulfilling my own expectations whereas I get the impression he is more open to exploring. 'Simplicity is based on your feel for the game. Follow your feel of the game. He has a side that allows him to be sensitive to the way the game is moving. 'I look at his routine before he kicks and I understand what he is doing when he drags his leg back twice. My approach was geared around reconnecting with the simplicity of it all. 'I would tap the floor with my foot. The way I would do that, I would be almost in the perfect position. 'So I would then be visualising my foot being solid and as I was tapping the ground, it would be where the ball was going to be and I was sensing the feel of what I was going to achieve. You are trying to understand the kick is part of you and you already have you. 'It is about reconnecting to that part of you that can decide things effortlessly... otherwise it feels like a lot of trying.' Owen Farrell is looking to join Martin Johnson as a England World Cup-winning captain\n\nHe is still happy to talk about that drop goal in 2003 but it is as if he has disconnected himself from it. Someone else kicked it. Another person in another time.\n\nThere is no sense that he regards it as a high point. His view of it, he says, depends on how he is feeling at any given moment. So in this park, I ask him, on this bench, on this day in Tokyo, how does he regard it?\n\n'I feel like it was nothing more than a\u2026' he says, before his voice trails off. 'If we're going to play the game that it was actually me doing it and not another version of me, I find that what interests me is that from such a young age, with such a clear devotion towards making something happen, a journey could find its way down so many different avenues and arrive at that point.\n\n'The number of times my career looked as if it was going off in a different direction but the way that suddenly it appeared here and then at school, and Newcastle and then England junior things and Newcastle and Newcastle to England and ups and downs.\n\n'And then suddenly you find yourself in the World Cup and then suddenly you find yourself in the final and then suddenly you find yourself in extra time and then suddenly you find yourself in the last few seconds and suddenly you find yourself with the ball in your hand and then suddenly you find yourself with a drop goal.\n\n'I find that incredibly intriguing. I don't know whether it was good or bad. It was a beautiful realisation of a goal. How could what started as imagination arrive as so close to what I imagined?\n\n'Was it a great moment? I don't really understand. I sometimes wish I hadn't been on the field so I could have understood the gravity of what it meant.'\n\nWilkinson calls last night after he has worked on the England game for ITV. England in the final next Saturday raises the prospect of a new generation of players being affected by the same pressures and spotlight that assailed him.\n\n'Their lives will have already started to change, just by beating the All Blacks at a World Cup,' he says. 'All the stuff that will be going on at home. Everything that will be in the papers. People will be contacting their families. Hopefully, it changes nothing about you.\n\n'If you are grounded, it can be amazing. If your feet are not planted in something deeper, it can feel like, 'what the hell is going on?'\n\nEngland, led by captain Owen Farrell (R), performed superbly to beat New Zealand on Saturday\n\n'It was one of the best England performances I have seen for a long, long time. It had intensity, accuracy and clarity of decision-making.\n\n'I don't remember that many games where you are going up against a team that is that exceptional. We are entering into a space of brand new. It was a battle where they put everything on the line.'\n\nHe is clear that neither winning the final in 2003 or losing it four years later brought him the freedom from pressure he longed for or the life outside the game he desired.\n\nOff the pitch, he says, he was only ever half there, trapped in regrets about kicks he had missed or in obsessing about making amends in his next match.\n\nHe says that for maybe 5 per cent of the time during much of his rugby career, he was a fully-functioning person. The rest of the time, distracted by his strivings, crushed by the pressure, he was 'a mess'. The agonies of waiting for a match were among the worst times.\n\n'In the 2007 World Cup,' he says, 'we were playing France in the semi-finals and they used to put the newspapers outside the hotel room door and I remember coming back from breakfast on the day of the match and looking down at the paper and the headline said 'Ayez peur, ayez tres peur' which means 'Be afraid, be very afraid'.\n\nAnd it was my picture on the front of the paper. They were saying the French should be afraid of me. I sat there and couldn't move. I was watching DVDs to try and relax in the afternoon and all I could see was the outside of the TV screen. My mind was blown with the idea that everything you do becomes who you are.\n\nJONNY ON THE FINAL 'From the semi-final onwards, I felt things looked after themselves. It was the group games and the quarters where it felt there was all this work and complexity. 'As far as the final goes, you sort of think somehow things have got to change but when you get there, there is never anything else to do other than just prepare. 'Preparing is just about understanding the game plan and understanding your roles and being able to go into that game feeling hugely supported by the team around you. 'But it is also about feeling liberated to go and explore what you are capable of because to not have that would be an absolute mess. 'That has probably been the downfall of a lot of teams in the bigger games: they stop looking for how good they can be.'\n\n'What I have realised now is that what happens sometimes changes the content of your life but it can't do anything to you. Underneath, I am still the same. I still have the same potential to explore my life as I did in 2003 and 2007 but back then both tournaments became trigger points towards the idea that winning or losing defines who you are.\n\n'The liberation is moving away from that and realising that all you have is your performance now and when you perform fully, you fully engage and when you fully engage, there is no you any more. It is just what you do. It's the part where everyone wants to be.\n\n'Whether you go down the park with your mates or whether you are in front of 80,000, the only thing that matters is when you are fully engaged and everything falls away and that is when people perform well.'\n\nHe is free, he says, of the exhausting cycle of suffering and triumph that dominated his existence for so long and eventually wore him down psychologically. He had persuaded himself that there could not be one without the other but now he has been liberated from that.\n\n'There was always this idea that there was a pay-off coming, the idea that, 'If we win the World Cup in 2003, life's going to be like this.' But after 2003, I realised there was nothing there waiting for me. So I told myself that if we did it again in 2007, there would be.\n\nJonny Wilkinson steered England to another final in 2007, but that time they fell short in Paris\n\n'And if it wasn't that, then I'd be saying 'Let's go to France and win everything in club rugby and in your last game, you could win a championship and then it's going to be there'.\n\n'The pay-off is now in that engagement in life. The only way to get to that engagement is to drop all the ideas that you are on your way to find your now in the future.'\n\nWilkinson, who retired in 2014, believes he has taken big strides to doing that. He still has a busy life. He is here combining his role as a kicking adviser for England with his job as an analyst for ITV.\n\nOn the eve of the tournament, he launched a mental health campaign with the health insurer, Vitality. His Jonny Wilkinson Foundation also aims to help with mental health issues. I ask him what he gains fulfilment from now and he does not pause.\n\n'Everything, literally everything. I am so fully into what I am doing. You know when you find a film you love watching, the time flies and you stop thinking 'it's me watching a film' and you become the experience, there are no barriers left.\n\nWilkinson has worked with Farrell in his role as a kicking adviser for the England team\n\nPrince Harry, with Lawrence Dallaglio, at a Jonny Wilkinson Foundation event earlier this year\n\n'I feel like I'm so much more engaged in what I'm doing. I see opportunity in everything. I just feel more connected. More than I ever feel I have been.\n\n'I go to the gym where the England guys train and just kick a load of balls around myself for 40 minutes. but when I leave, it doesn't mean I'm thinking, 'Oh no, now I've got to go home now and do some washing up'.\n\n'I go home and I'm washing up and all of me is washing up. I feel pretty much all of me is where I am, here and now and engaged. That was the secret to my performance when I was at my best on the rugby field and now I feel like I am enjoying life again.'\n\nJonny Wilkinson is a pundit for ITV Sport at the Rugby World Cup.
