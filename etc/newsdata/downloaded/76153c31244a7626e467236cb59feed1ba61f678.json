D.C. is not a real city \u2014 stay loyal to your hometown team. https://t.co/7qzVTVXktL \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nThe addendum to this is that it is okay to have the Nationals be your ***secondary*** team if your primary team doesn\u2019t make the playoffs etc. \u2014 but D.C. is a made-up city so you can not abandon your hometown team upon moving here. \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nLittle did Dunleavy know that he\u2019d kicked a massive hornet\u2019s nest:\n\nLots of people angry that I called D.C. a made-up city \u2014 some even calling me racist for doing so! \u2014 so, just to be clear, every city except for Cleveland is a made up city. Stop being fans of teams from made up cities. \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nGuys, this is not a drill:\n\nIt is racist to dunk on D.C. send tweet https://t.co/5EmvXfqF60 \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s quite clearly a joke. Calm down. https://t.co/XwaUcDAgv7 \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nThis Washington Post writer just tweeted then deleted a \u201csend him back!\u201d tweet at me in response to my joke. My veins can not handle this. pic.twitter.com/KiEyNfIssT \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd Chris Richards wasn\u2019t even the only WaPo guy to pounce (yes, we said \u201cpounce\u201d) on Dunleavy. Their social media editor Ric Sanchez also called Dunleavy out for his \u201ckinda-racist DC take\u201d:\n\nlol shoutout to the guy who took the annoying baseball take and then upgraded it to the kinda-racist DC take pic.twitter.com/bfMBZEebiH \u2014 \ud835\udd97.\ud835\udd8e.\ud835\udd95. sanchez (@ricsanchez) October 16, 2019\n\nYES, DRAG HIM! \u2014 sharia board \ud83d\udc73\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf83 (@SirajAHashmi) October 16, 2019\n\nDrag him, Ric.\n\none hundred thousand yikes! \u2014 Hannah Jewell (@hcjewell) October 16, 2019\n\nhe's like quadrupling down, too! ! \u2014 \ud835\udd97.\ud835\udd8e.\ud835\udd95. sanchez (@ricsanchez) October 16, 2019\n\nQuadrupling down? Wow, this sounds serious.\n\nRic Sanchez isn\u2019t a real Blue Check. https://t.co/DYmCdlfRMV \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nA Washington Post employee is doing nothing but tracking my tweets right now. Amazing. And excuse me sir but at this point I\u2019ve at least quintupled or sextupled or septupled down at least. Arguably even octupled\u2014 you tell me, since this is apparently what you\u2019re being paid to do! https://t.co/EUCXSKoLng \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nNice work if you can get it.\n\nric, now that people are like hey dude don't do that it's now a joke, according to him!!!! \u2014 Chelsea Cirruzzo \u2615\ufe0f (@ChelseaCirruzzo) October 16, 2019\n\nhe's not mad, he's laughing, actually \u2014 \ud835\udd97.\ud835\udd8e.\ud835\udd95. sanchez (@ricsanchez) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd as you all can see, there\u2019s absolutely nothing funny about any of this.\n\nIt's racist because um it just is \u2014 Huell Babineaux did nothing wrong (@jtLOL) October 16, 2019\n\nRic Sanchez says it\u2019s racist. His word should be enough for you.\n\nnot sure about this one! \u2014 Halloween Name Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) October 16, 2019\n\nThis ain\u2019t it, chief \u2014 JCF (@jcfris1) October 16, 2019\n\nHow is this \"kinda-racist\"? \u2014 The Purple Pilgrim (@Purple_Pilgrim8) October 16, 2019\n\nRacist? Lmfao \u2014 Malak Kobbe (@Malak_Kobbe) October 16, 2019\n\nWhere's the race part? I'm confused. \u2014 Zombie Aaron, MD \ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@swaggymdees) October 16, 2019\n\nDC is not a race \u2014 Reluctant Exister (@IriathZhul) October 16, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not? No way.\n\nThis is ridiculous. Unplug for a day, man. \u2014 Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) October 16, 2019\n\nlol all i'm saying is that's it's a tone-deaf tweet at best \u2014 \ud835\udd97.\ud835\udd8e.\ud835\udd95. sanchez (@ricsanchez) October 16, 2019\n\nWhat\u2019s tone-deaf about it? Seems like Ric\u2019s the tone-deaf one here.\n\ni just feel like someone who (even jokingly!) says \"dc is not real it's all K Street transplants\" must realize that their experience is perhaps different than that of a lot of people who are from here, who also do not look like him \u2014 \ud835\udd97.\ud835\udd8e.\ud835\udd95. sanchez (@ricsanchez) October 16, 2019\n\nI will stop trolling for one sec here. Ric is calling me a racist because he\u2019s mad I joked that D.C. is not a real city while dunking on transplants who move to D.C. & become bandwagon fans of the Nationals. A bit of sports humor by me \u2014 and he is calling me racist in response. https://t.co/r7a4fM6iSb \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 16, 2019\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work!\n\nHow is this racist? You need a break. \u2014 Paul Z. (@zoll_p) October 16, 2019\n\nRacist? Lmao.
