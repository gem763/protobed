The most recent flashpoint, of course, has been the self-abasement of the Houston Rockets basketball team.\n\nAs Breitbart News put it, the Rockets and the entire National Basketball Association have \u201ccaved\u201d to Red China. Indeed, pro basketball is so eager to kowtow to Beijing that it has imported a little bit of Chinese-style totalitarianism to the U.S. Just on Wednesday, basketball authorities engaged in the pettiest possible censorship of its live audience at a game, right before a streaming camera.\n\nWe can leave it to the subversive wits at Babylon Bee to capture the utter craziness of the moment, in which woke corporate values have displaced familiar patriotic values: \u201cNBA Now Requiring All Players To Stand For Chinese National Anthem.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just the NBA; it\u2019s Activision Blizzard, it\u2019s Apple and Google. In fact, Bloomberg News circulated a long list of American companies that have similarly bowed down to China.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? How is it happening that American leading economic players are now taking orders from China? How did \u201cYankee Imperialism\u201d turn into \u201cPanda Imperialism\u201d?\n\nOnce upon a time, there was the hopeful belief that capitalism and free trade would open up China. And yet by now, we\u2019re learned that the Chinese dictatorship hasn\u2019t been opened up by the flow of American money, it\u2019s been empowered by all that cash.\n\nIn the words of New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo, \u201cA darker truth is now dawning on the world: China\u2019s economic miracle hasn\u2019t just failed to liberate Chinese people. It is also now routinely corrupting the rest of us outside of China.\u201d\n\nWe might also let Chris Arnade, the ex-Wall Streeter who found his true calling as the photographer/chronicler of gritty \u201cback row\u201d America, tell this sorry tale his way; dripping with scorn for the \u201cfront row\u201d of both parties, Arnade tweeted:\n\nFor years front row has scolded anyone who disagreed on China, \u201cActually, trading with China is good. Sure we will lose jobs here, sure they destroy the environment & abuse human rights, but it a necessary step you see. Democracy follows capitalism! Just give them time.\u201d Democracy hasn\u2019t followed. It has been a classic scam, one front-row elites in both parties use to push policies that screw over the working class, who are \u201cless educated\u201d than them. Telling them, \u201cActually this is for the greater good. You can\u2019t see it. But trust us experts.\u201d\n\nAs China expert Gordon Chang said on Sirius XM radio\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, the Chinese government is \u201cweaponizing our companies against us.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s hard to think of a China-watcher who has gone further as a China-critiquer than Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a pro-competition, anti-monopoly think tank in Washington, DC.\n\nStoller\u2019s normal field is business and economics, and yet the threat from China is so great that he\u2019s been sounding a loud klaxon horn, as he tweeted on October 6:\n\nThe aim of the CCP is to dominate the entire world, and to replace liberal norms with authoritarian ones. The time to act is now. We need to stop exporting movies and entertainment to China. We need to ban TikTok and do an emergency build-up of 5G capacity. Now.\n\nWe can note that TikTok is a made-in-China social media app. And we might pause to observe that if it\u2019s bad enough that the Silicon Valley tech companies are spying on us, it\u2019s worse when Chinese tech companies are doing the spying. And 5G, of course, is the next-gen wireless network that Huawei would like to own on behalf of its owner, the Chinese government.\n\nSo we can see: On the topic of China, Stoller sounds a lot like, say, Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump senior adviser who now helps lead The Committee on the Present Danger: China.\n\nYet interestingly, as he makes the case against kowtowing to China, Stoller seems to have one target above all: Joe Biden.\n\nRed Star Star over Hollywood: Middle-Class Joe and Big Panda\n\nOn October 7, in his free e-mail newsletter, BIG, Stoller headlined a piece, \u201cHow Joe Biden Empowered China\u2019s Censorship of the NBA.\u201d\n\nStoller started by describing how the former vice president had helped Hollywood\u2014and here again, as Virgil noted on October 5, the simple facts about Biden have been hiding in plain sight.\n\nSo Stoller cranked his wayback machine\u2026not very far at all, merely to May 2, 2014, when the Washington Post ran an article, \u201cHow Biden helped Hollywood unlock China.\u201d The piece was positive, of course, focusing on how great it was that the intrepid vice president had persuaded the Chinese to accept more American movies into their home market. Indeed, the article featured a photo of a smiling Biden and a smiling Xi, holding up a t-shirt that read, in English, \u201cFostering Goodwill Between America & China.\u201d (Hunter Biden, then an active player in Chinese commerce, wasn\u2019t mentioned anywhere in the piece.)\n\nYet if the Post was happy about Biden\u2019s China-dealing, Stoller is not. As he wrote in his newsletter, \u201cWhat Biden \u2026 didn\u2019t consider was the leverage over studio output that that [sic] increased dependency on the Chinese market gave to the Chinese government.\u201d\n\nIn other words, yes, the Chinese agreed to put money in Hollywood\u2019s pocket. And yet at the same time, the Chinese bought influence on Hollywood\u2019s product.\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. Government\u2019s Economic and Security Review Commission released a report, the headline of which says it all: \u201cDirected by Hollywood, Edited by China: How China\u2019s Censorship and Influence Affect Films Worldwide.\u201d\n\nOr as Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte wrote on October 8, the Chinese have been shaping a long list of recent films, including Red Dawn, Gravity, and Top Gun: Maverick. Quoth Nolte: \u201cHollywood literally sold its artistic soul to the Communist Chinese.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of soul-selling, we can add that young Hunter Biden it still active in Chinese business. Just on October 9, three reporters for the Financial Times\u2014one in D.C., one in Beijing, and one in Kiev\u2014teamed up to account for the younger Biden\u2019s business dabblings. And while the reportorial trio could not possibly get to the bottom of everything Hunter has been up to, this much is known:\n\nIn addition to his ties to Ukraine through Burisma, the scandal-plagued gas company, and politically connected business ventures in the US, public records show that Hunter Biden still sits on the board of BHR Partners, a private investment fund backed by a number of Chinese state entities including Bank of China, China Postal Savings Bank and China Development Bank.\n\nAnd the next day, October 10, came this curious headline in the same Financial Times: \u201cTrump adviser says China provided information about Hunter Biden: Michael Pillsbury claims Beijing supplied background on alleged $1.5bn payment.\u201d The article provided few details, so we\u2019ll have to stay tuned on that one; in the meantime, we can observe that $1.5 billion is a lot of money. In fact, Pillsbury seems to have backed away from some of his assertions; no doubt the matter will continue to be sorted out in the days to come.\n\nYet if we step back from the immediate pushing and pulling of the news and spin cycle, we can see that maybe there\u2019s a reason why Joe Biden has been so dismissive of the economic and strategic threat from China; as he said on May 1, \u201cChina is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. \u2026 I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what: they\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d\n\nGiven Joe\u2019s la-de-da attitude, it\u2019s easy to see why Hunter is so popular in China; to the master string-pullers in Beijing, the cultivation of the son seems to be paying off in a large harvest of good will from the father.\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder that Noah Smith, a center-left columnist for Bloomberg News, was moved to tweet on October 8 about the upcoming presidential election, \u201cIf I were the Chinese government, I\u2019d definitely be pulling for Biden.\u201d\n\nThe Threat from China: We\u2019ve Seen This Before\n\nIn addition to his criticism of Biden\u2019s China-chumminess on economic grounds, Stoller sees China as a profound military and ideological threat, of the type we haven\u2019t seen in more than seven decades. As he tweeted on October 7, \u201cChina is an expansionist fascist state.\u201d [emphasis added] Adding, \u201cAt what point will we wake up?\u201d\n\nThen Stoller went even further, directly comparing the People\u2019s Republic of China to not just fascists, but to actual Nazis\u2014to Hitler\u2019s Third Reich in Germany.\n\nThat\u2019s a strong charge, so let\u2019s let Stoller make his case: Returning to the issue of China and Hollywood, Stoller wrote, \u201cIn the 1930s, the Nazis sought, through the size of the Germany market, to prevent Hollywood from making movies critical of the Hitler regime, with some success.\u201d In other words, Hollywood was at least partly dissuaded from making anti-Nazi movies.\n\nThis dark history has been well-recorded; here\u2019s The Hollywood Reporter on July 31, 2013: \u201cThe Chilling History of How Hollywood Helped Hitler.\u201d As writer Ben Urwand explained, \u201cThe big studios, desperate to protect German business, let Nazis censor scripts, remove credits from Jews, get movies stopped and even force one MGM executive to divorce his Jewish wife.\u201d\n\nLater that year, Urwand published a book from Harvard University Press: The Collaboration: Hollywood\u2019s Pact with Hitler.\n\nYet as is so often the case, that the facts are there isn\u2019t enough; someone has to come along and connect the dots, turning historical data points into a media-friendly narrative for the present day. And that\u2019s what Stoller has done, by linking Hollywood\u2019s servitude to Hitler in the 1930s to Hollywood\u2019s kowtow to Xi Jinping today.\n\nIn fact, Stoller goes even further in his Nazi analogizing, venturing from the glittery world of movie-making to the dead-serious world of munitions-making.\n\nJoined by Lucas Kunce, an ex-Marine, Stoller recently published a long discussion of Nazi efforts to penetrate the U.S. in The American Conservative; the two co-authors detailed Hitler\u2019s determination, in the 1930s, to hollow out our industrial base.\n\nPerhaps belatedly, the Roosevelt administration was alert to the threat. In 1941, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, Norman Littell, delivered a speech entitled, \u201cThe German Invasion of American Business.\u201d The Nazis, Littell argued, were using legal techniques\u2014including patent laws, stock ownership, dummy corporations, and cartel arrangements\u2014to extend their power into the U.S. and weaken American industry.\n\nAs Littell put it, \u201cThe distinction between bombing a vital plant out of existence from an airplane and preventing that plant from coming into existence in the first place [through cartel arrangements] is largely a difference in the amount of noise involved.\u201d\n\nStoller and Kunce added a fearsome litany of Hitlerian maleficence:\n\nNazis used their American subsidiary corporations to spy on U.S. industrial capacity and steal technology, such as walkie-talkies, intertank and ground-air radio communication systems, and shortwave sets developed by the U.S. Army and Navy. They used patents or cartel arrangements to restrict the production of stainless steel, tungsten-carbide, and fuel injection equipment. According to the U.S. military after the war, I.G. Farben, the Nazi chemical monopoly, had influence over American production of \u201csynthetic gas and oils, dyestuffs, explosives, synthetic rubber (\u2018Buna\u2019), menthol, cellophane, and other products,\u201d and sought to keep the United States \u201centirely dependent\u201d on Germany for certain types of electrical equipment.\n\nIf all that industrial skullduggery sounds sort of familiar, that\u2019s because the Chinese have been doing it, too\u2014with the full acquiescence of some recent American presidents. Indeed, just on October 1, Stoller headlined another of his pieces, \u201cHow Bill Clinton and American Financiers Armed China.\u201d\n\nIs America Finally Waking Up?\n\nAlthough he paints a pessimistic picture of Chinese penetration in the here and now, Stoller is actually optimistic in the longer run. As he puts it, \u201cChina\u2019s biggest asset in gaining power was how most people in the West just didn\u2019t realize that the CCP aimed to use it.\u201d He adds, \u201cNow China\u2019s cover is blown.\u201d\n\nStill, Stoller is not complacent; he calls for all-out mobilization:\n\nIn the commercial sector, rebuilding the industrial base will require an aggressive national mobilization strategy. This means aggressive investment by government to rebuild manufacturing capacity, selective tariffs to protect against Chinese or foreign predation, regulation to stop financial predation by Wall Street, and anti-monopoly enforcement to block the exploitation of market power.\n\nAs it happens, more than two years ago, Virgil declared that the threat from China amounted to a \u201cSputnik Moment,\u201d requiring just that sort of mobilization. So it\u2019s with a sense of relief that he hears more voices chorusing the same message.\n\nIn fact, on October 9, Bloomberg News\u2019s Shawn Donnan described the deterioration of U.S.-Chinese relations, taking note of \u201chow the popular conversation about China is spreading,\u201d then adding, \u201cThe moves against Chinese tech companies reflect growing bipartisan anxiety in Washington about China\u2019s crackdown in Xinjiang. But it\u2019s the worsening situation in Hong Kong that is really helping to crystallize things.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that same day, the Trump administration blacklisted eight Chinese companies involved in the systemic suppression of the Uyghurs in China\u2019s western Xinjiang province; one might assume that there are a few thousand more such companies involved, but at least it\u2019s a start.\n\nSo maybe now is the right time for Americans to take a serious look at retired Air Force Gen. Rob Spalding\u2019s sobering new book, Stealth War: How China Took Over While America\u2019s Elite Slept. Spalding, a former top China strategist at the Pentagon, has been a frequent guest on Breitbart\u2019s Sirius XM show.\n\nYes, the road ahead is daunting. Yet at least Americans are waking up to the clear and present danger.\n\nExcept, of course, for Sleepy Joe Biden, who, as we have seen, has his own family reasons for staying drowsy as the threat from China grows.", "description": "Americans are seeing the distressing spectacle of American corporations kowtowing to a new kind of emperor, Xi Jinping, and his Chinese Communist Party.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nazis-marching-china-marching-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
