Here are some of the problems with that.", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump asserted Friday that he had \u201ca right to go to a foreign country\u201d to seek an investigation into allegations of corruption.\n\n\u201cIf we feel that there\u2019s corruption, like I feel like there was in 2016 campaign \u2014 there was tremendous corruption against me \u2014 if we feel there\u2019s corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered on the South Lawn.\n\nWhat the president did not mention was that the allegations involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2014 which have been raised almost exclusively by Trump himself, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and a handful of right-wing conspiracy theorists \u2014 were directed against the man is the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to run against him in 2020.\n\nThis raises two interrelated issues. One is that, on the face of it, Trump was asking two foreign governments, Ukraine and China, for what would amount to help in his reelection campaign. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which was signed into law the following year by then-President Richard Nixon, prohibits foreign nationals from contributing \u201canything of value\u201d to a federal election campaign or candidate. But FEC chair Ellen Weintraub told Yahoo News that the principle of keeping elections free of foreign influence goes back much further.\n\n\u201cThis really goes back to the founding principles of our nation,\u201d Weintraub said Friday in a telephone interview. \u201cThe founding fathers talked about foreign interference in our domestic affairs. George Washington wrote about it. Thomas Jefferson wrote about it. This is a longstanding concern in the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Weintraub appeared to refer to Trump\u2019s public request that the two governments investigate Biden when she posted on Twitter a summary of the law on foreign election influence. But on Friday, she declined to speak to the specifics of efforts to enlist foreign assistance, instead limiting her remarks to the statute.\n\nU.S. Federal Election Commission Commissioner Ellen Weintraub.

The point is that the ban is on anything of value from a foreign source.\u201d\n\nBrendan Fischer, a director at the non-partisan election watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, said it was clear that Trump was clearly seeking a political boost by asking China and Ukraine to investigate his political rival.\n\n\u201cThere should be no real doubt that a foreign government investigation into President Trump\u2019s 2020 political rival would be of value to him as a candidate,\u201d Fischer told Yahoo News. \u201cWe may not be able to put a precise value on that investigation. It should be obvious that such an investigation would be of value to President Trump\u2019s campaign and hurt Joe Biden\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe FEC does punish individuals and campaigns for civil violations of campaign finance law, sometimes issuing fines. Criminal violations fall to the Justice Department, but in the Ukraine matter Attorney General William Barr himself was involved, making the prospect of prosecution extremely remote at best.\n\n\u201cFor a campaign finance violation to be criminal it has to be knowing and willful, which I think was established, as the call was made one day after Robert Mueller testified on Capitol Hill and reaffirmed that it is illegal to solicit anything of value from a foreign national,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cPresident Trump knew what the law was and made this request anyway.\u201d\n\nApart from the question of election law violations, the spectacle of the president publicly soliciting foreign governments \u2014 whose justice systems, to put it politely, don\u2019t always measure up to America\u2019s \u2014 to investigate and potentially prosecute a U.S. citizen, let alone a former vice president, appalled even some prominent Republicans.", "description": "FEC chair Ellen Weintraub clarifies  the principle behind campaign finance laws outlawing foreign election help.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sIuTSUK9.GY5R5ppvvF09g--~B/aD0zMjg2O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/05eddda0-e6fd-11e9-8fbf-1b12b043b080", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
