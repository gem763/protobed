The Forex pair is trading inside yesterday\u2019s range on well-below average volume, indicating investor indecision and impending volatility.\n\nToday\u2019s Fed decision could produce a wicked two-sided trade because there is a little uncertainty ahead of the announcements. The Fed is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate 25-basis points. This news has been priced into the financial markets for weeks. The Fed\u2019s monetary policy statement, however, is up in the air.\n\nAt 09:25 GMT, the USD/JPY is trading 108.211, up 0.094 or +0.09%.\n\nTraders are being cautious because they don\u2019t know if the Fed is going to signal future rate cuts with conviction. Traders have priced in four rate cuts this year with the next two coming in October or December. Given the improving inflation picture, solid jobs market, and the easing of trade tensions between the United States and China, the Fed may hint that the September rate cut is the last of the year or it may suggest there will only be one more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll underwhelm everyone and not overwhelm anyone,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. She expects a cut of 25 basis points, taking the fed funds target rate range to 1.75 to 2.0%, following the last quarter point cut on July 31.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t promise anything more. He\u2019ll keep his cards close to his chest. He\u2019ll be an artful dodger again,\u201d said Swonk.\n\nAfter the Fed releases its policy decision, traders will turn to the Bank of Japan\u2019s meeting ending on Thursday to see if it follows its global peers by easing policy.\n\nDeepening negative rates will be the key option if the BOJ were to ease, although the central bank may accompany that with measures to mitigate the pain on financial institutions, sources have told Reuters.\n\nDaily Forecast\n\nLook for enhanced volatility with the release of the Fed announcements. Firstly, there will be a reaction to the interest rate decision. Although a rate cut is expected, there are still enough traders on the sidelines to produce a wicked reaction.\n\nSecondly, look for volatility after the Fed reveals its forecasts on the \u201cdot plot\u201d charts. The markets are currently indicating two more rate cuts, but economists said it\u2019s unlikely the Fed forecast will include more than one more rate cut in its outlook for this year.\n\nBe prepared for a wicked two-sided swing in the USD/JPY. Key support is 107.463. This level has to hold as support, or the Dollar/Yen could plunge.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Look for enhanced volatility with the release of the Fed announcements.
