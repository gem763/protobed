The Curvy Skinny Premium jeans by Torrid have a waist that sits in a really good place \u2014 it\u2019s not low, or too high-waist. It hits me right below the belly button. My shape is more like an apple-glass versus an hourglass because I carry a lot of my weight in my stomach, and this rise creates a smooth line from my hip to my waist so I feel comfortable standing and sitting. With plus jeans, stretch material is sometimes overdone to the point where you have to size down, but the Curvy Skinny feels like regular denim. I\u2019ve had these jeans for more than a year, and I\u2019m a size 20 now, but I\u2019ve worn them at a size 24, and the shape and the structure holds up whether you size up or size down.\u201d \u2014 Cece Olisa, TheCurvyCon co-founder, size 20", "description": "The best plus-size jeans according to real women, from stretch high-waisted versions to ones that are bootcut.", "authors": ["Priya Rao"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2018/01/12/plus-jeans/12-plus-jeans-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
