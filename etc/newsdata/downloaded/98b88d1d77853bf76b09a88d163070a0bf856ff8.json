They have watched as the margin of victory in marquee statewide races has gone from 20 percentage points by Gov. Greg Abbott over former state Sen. Wendy Davis in 2014, to Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz's 2.6 percentage point victory over former Rep. Beto O'Rourke in 2018.\n\nIn 2016 Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Texas by 9 percentage points.\n\nIs the threat from Democrats real?\n\nTrump last week offered clues on his view of Texas. His campaign named Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick honorary chairman of his Texas Trump Victory Leadership Team.\n\nMore important, the campaign named Stephanie Alexander regional political director and veteran operative Taylor Mattox state director of the campaign.\n\nAlso last week, Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee hosted an economic roundtable discussion in Austin to illustrate in their view how the president's policies have helped Americans prosper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's moves are a signal that the situation in Texas is uncertain, and his involvement will not only help himself but congressional and state legislative candidates in close races.\n\nConsider that there's been limited campaigning in Texas by a GOP nominee for president since 1976, when Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford here to become the last Democratic presidential candidate to win in Texas. Former President George W. Bush held rallies in his home state, of course, but the party made little investment here Neither did Democrats.\n\nThat could change in 2020.\n\n\"There is no sure thing anymore in Texas politics,\" said Republican consultant Bill Miller. \"The Republicans are not a lock. If you are in denial, you are inaccurate about the political reality.\"\n\nMiller and others point to the shifting Texas demographics and political climate as a reason for the state's battleground status.\n\nThe electorate still leans Republican, but so many people are moving into the state from the West and East they are having an impact on political contests, particularly in the suburbs.\n\nIn 2018 O'Rourke won Tarrant County and got 46% of the vote in reliably red Collin County.\n\nFor 2020 Democrats have targeted state representative candidates in those counties and other areas that are undergoing demographic changes.\n\nLast week Sen. John Cornyn, who says he expects a tough reelection battle next year, warned Republicans about the changing face of Texas.\n\n\"Every single day, liberals are moving out of California. They're tired of paying their state's out-of-control taxes, tired of compromising their safety in exchange for dangerous sanctuary cities, and tired of living under other harmful left-wing policies,\" Cornyn's campaign team stated in a fundraising email to supporters titled \"Texas is slipping.\" \"This change in population is causing our state to lose its reputation as a stronghold for conservative values. ... It's threatening to turn Texas blue.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can guess the rest of the email, which stated giving money to Cornyn would help keep Texas a conservative bastion.\n\nCornyn and other candidates will rely on Trump to fire up the conservative base and exceed that effort by a yet-to-be-determined Democratic Party nominee for president.\n\n\"With President Trump at the top of the Republican ticket in Texas, I expect we will increase our margin of victory from 2016 and that he will help ensure more GOP victories up and down the ballot,\" Patrick said in the release announcing the Trump Texas team.\n\nMiller, the consultant, said Trump's appointment of Patrick would help.\n\n\"Patrick is a good operative,\" Miller said. \"This shows that they are not taking anything for granted and that flies in the face that we don't have anything to worry about.\"\n\nExpect Trump to make several campaign visits to Texas between now and November 2020.\n\nBucking tradition, his appearances won't just be to raise money, but to drive conservative voters to the polls.\n\nAfter more than 40 years, Texas matters.", "description": "Trump bolsters Texas campaign as GOP grapples with shifting demographics", "authors": ["Gromer Jeffers Jr."], "top_image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer//CxuYSDMB_c-cp0amJoUdDiKtlag=/1200x630/smart/filters:no_upscale()/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-dmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3CF336UFRNNYUY3WUPARHMW34I.jpg"}
