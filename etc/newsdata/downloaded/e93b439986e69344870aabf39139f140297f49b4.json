While some data is already released, now it will be more systematic, provided in tables and also collated in its annual report.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to enhance communication and transparency,\u201d the ECB said in a statement. \u201cThese practices go beyond what is strictly required by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this way the ECB is providing relevant information on its strategy, assessments and policy decisions to the broader public and the financial markets.\u201d\n\nThe ECB has only intervened twice in its history -- in 2000 and in 2011. The first time was to stem weakening of the euro shortly after its creation, and the second was a coordinated move by Group of Seven countries after the yen strengthened following an earthquake.", "description": "ECB Will Publish Currency Intervention Data on Quarterly Basis", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf39d51869524677fc9943b77266634cc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
