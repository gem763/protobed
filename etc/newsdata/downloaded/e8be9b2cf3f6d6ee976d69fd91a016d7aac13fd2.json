The curricula were indefinitely shelved.\n\nHe later helped spearhead the 2014 pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement,\" demanding direct elections for Hong Kong's chief executive after Beijing decided to maintain its control over how candidates are selected. Earlier this year Wong was jailed for charges related to the 2014 protests, but he was released in June.\n\nWong and other activists have been barred from standing for elections in the past, but so far this time he is the only candidate to be barred.\n\nWong's disqualification comes as Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday reiterated her pledge not to negotiate with \"rioters,\" accusing the protesters of \"finding excuses\" to cause chaos, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nLam said her government was taking measures to counter a technical recession, blaming the frequently violent protests for dragging down Hong Kong's economy.\n\nAlthough the protests have gained steam only since June, she pointed to \"negative economic growth\" for the whole of 2019, compared to 3% growth for 2018.\n\n\"For the government to resort to measures that will appease the violent rioters, I don't think that is the solution,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"To get to the root of the problems, we must stop violence and let calmness restore in the city,\" she said.", "description": "An elections officials said the pro-democracy activist's call for \"self-determination\" in the Chinese territory was inconsistent with pledging allegiance to the city and its constitution.", "authors": ["Emily Feng", "Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/29/ap_19302156879372_wide-f28330f58772b46a5141fb4cb0341a1799492105.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
