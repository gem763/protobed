The bonus point was secured before half time and although there might be concern at yellow cards shown to Nepo Laulala and Ofa Tuungafasi for high tackles, the All Blacks look in ominous form heading into their last pool match against Italy. Outstanding centre Anton Lienert-Brown, flying winger Sevu Reece and fullback Ben Smith all scored two tries and Jordie Barrett, making a first test start at flyhalf, also crossed and kicked eight conversions. Namibia, who have never won a World Cup match in 22 attempts, opened the scoring and drew within one point at 10-9 after half an hour but bridging the huge gulf in class was beyond them and their physical challenge waned as they tired.
