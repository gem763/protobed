Maybe in this [bent] pyramid, who knows?\"\n\nThe pyramid has been opened for the first time since it was excavated in 1956 and comes as Egypt seeks to boost tourism, particularly to less-visited areas.\n\nVisitors can also enter a 18-metre high \"side pyramid\", that was possibly built for Sneferu's wife, Hetepheres.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The pyramid, built for Pharaoh Sneferu around 2,600 BC, was built \"bent\" because the ground underneath wasn't stable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7263/c5cf8829710e4ae3ba515f2e310629a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
