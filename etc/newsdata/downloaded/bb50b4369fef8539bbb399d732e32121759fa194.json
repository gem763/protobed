We must adapt to this rapid change\u2026 but we can\u2019t go that fast,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Reform vision \u2013\n\nDeveloping the tourism industry is a key pillar of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Vision 2030 reform programme that aims to prepare the Arab world\u2019s largest economy, which is highly reliant on oil, for a diversified future.\n\nGlitzy promotional campaigns focus on ancient sites as well as breathtaking desert and coastal landscapes.\n\nBut authorities are also banking on large cities like the capital Riyadh and the western Red Sea port of Jeddah playing their part through large-scale investments in entertainment offerings.\n\nDespite these efforts, the capital \u2014 home to seven million people, including two million foreigners \u2014 has a sleepy air, with little of the glamour and buzz of its counterparts elsewhere in the Gulf.\n\nWith its wide sidewalks and high-end shops, Al-Tahlia Street in central Riyadh is often compared with the Champs-Elysees. But it has little of the energy and style of its famous Paris counterpart.\n\nOn an average weeknight, just a few families or groups of friends can be found seated on the restaurant terraces. Conversations are quiet and until recent years, music was not played inside dining venues.\n\nIn the middle of the avenue, which is punctuated by construction for the city\u2019s first metro system, a flashy facade stands out with a gigantic, luminous inscription announcing the \u201cSoho Club\u201d.\n\nElectronic music booms from inside, as the doorman, sporting a blazer and an earpiece, welcomes a visitor inside with a smile, but also a warning: \u201cIt\u2019s a respectable club\u201d.\n\nInside, the atmosphere is subdued, as people enjoy meals and a cosy decor that is more reminiscent of an English pub than a nightclub.\n\n\u201cWe are in favour of tourism, but foreigners must respect our traditions and customs in the way they dress and behave,\u201d one man firmly told an AFP reporting team, as he passed by in his traditional robe and chequered headdress.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Why would foreigners come?\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe conservative country, which forbids alcohol and is notorious for its gender segregation, may seem an unlikely destination for global tourists.\n\nSome young Saudis share those doubts.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about Riyadh. I\u2019ve just returned from a weekend in Dubai,\u201d said a 27-year-old telecoms salesman, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cWhen we have holidays, we go to Dubai,\u201d said his friend, referring to the comparatively free-wheeling emirate just a two-hour flight from Riyadh. \u201cWhy would foreigners come here?\u201d\n\nPrince Mohammed has sought to shake off his country\u2019s ultra-conservative image \u2014 lifting a ban on cinemas and women drivers as well as allowing gender-mixed concerts and sporting extravaganzas.\n\nBut the kingdom must match its reforms with a revamp of \u201cinadequate\u201d infrastructure, such as roads and hotels, economic planning consultant Abdullah al-Fayez said.\n\nAnd amid the rapid changes, the government must also raise awareness among Saudis about the importance of tourism for boosting the economy and employment opportunities, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is a bold experiment. But it is difficult to predict the problems it may pose to Saudi society and the extent of resistance by conservatives and radicals.\u201d", "description": "Riyadh (AFP) \u2013 In Riyadh\u2019s old quarter, a small group of Polish holidaymakers exploring the mud-brick Masmak Fort were making history as some", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/dd49d4_polish-tourists-listen-as-visit-king-abdulaziz-museum-masmak-in-old-quarter-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
