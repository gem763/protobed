One federal proposal currently being flirted with by policymakers on both sides of the aisle to meet this goal is expanding eligibility for Pell Grants\u2014the government\u2019s flagship student aid program for low- and moderate-income students\u2014to short-term programs that provide at least 150 clock hours of instruction over a minimum of eight weeks.\n\nBut if past is prologue, lawmakers should heed lessons learned before opening up nearly $30 billion in Pell funds to these shorter-term programs\u2014often vocational, skills-based courses like manufacturing trainings, IT boot camps, or healthcare certificates\u2014and ensure that strong guardrails are put in place to protect students and taxpayers. At this stage, data on short-term programs is limited, and when it comes to those as short as eight weeks, it\u2019s practically nonexistent. Elevating quality control to the forefront of this conversation is essential; without it, we risk repeating the troubling cycle of fraud, abuse, and poor student outcomes that has resulted from similar policy shifts in the past.\n\nTo be clear, such precedents do not mean that Pell funding for shorter-term programs should be off the table. Several programs across the country have become models in innovative career education, and we owe it to students who could benefit from shorter-term courses to closely examine their value through pilot programs and data collection initiatives.\n\nAs Congress considers allowing Pell dollars to flow to short-term programs that are largely unproven, historical precedent should serve as a reminder of what\u2019s at stake for students and taxpayers\u2014and of the need for strong quality assurance measures to protect this critical source of student aid.\n\nWe haven\u2019t always gotten this right before. Bad actors quickly appeared, for instance, when the federal loan program was opened to for-profit career programs in the late 1960s. National media expos\u00e9s revealed the extent of the abusive practices and aggressive recruiting tactics these schools used to defraud students, and Congress responded by increasing oversight, including enacting measures to protect returning Vietnam War veterans.\n\nBut by the mid-1980s, there was clear evidence that abuses were still plaguing the system: a 1984 report from the Government Accountability Office found that nearly half of for-profit vocational schools had committed some level of fraud, and Congressional hearings on the issue in 1990 exposed widespread predatory recruiting and poor student outcomes. The government again responded with greater oversight, tightening the requirements for federal aid eligibility in the 1992 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to create the current rules that limit the use of Pell Grants to programs that provide at least 600 clock hours of instruction over a minimum of 15 weeks.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve been down this road and back. We\u2019ve seen that when doors are opened to federal aid, predatory institutions often take advantage of newly available funding sources and, ultimately, of students. And we know that the system is still not free of bad actors. Scandals involving for-profit colleges throughout the 2000s and 2010s\u2014like the high-profile closings of ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges\u2014have continued to reveal fraudulent behaviors, with victims facing poor employment outcomes and unconquerable student debt.\n\nGiven this context, policymakers have an obligation to ensure that legislation protects students\u2014and taxpayer dollars\u2014from undue risk. And students should be able to expect that if they use their limited Pell funding on an eligible short-term program, they will receive a credential that has value and provides the skills necessary to move forward in their careers. Without strong guardrails in place to protect them from bad actors, we aren\u2019t currently in a position to promise them that.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t always gotten this right before, we have the opportunity to do so now. Congress has a responsibility to consider how well legislation is keeping up with the shifting relationship between higher education and work\u2014but it should take care to avoid replicating the mistakes of the past, and it cannot do so at the expense of Pell students who most need the economic mobility that higher education can provide.", "description": "But if past is prologue, lawmakers should heed lessons learned before opening up nearly $30 billion in Pell funds to these shorter-term programs\u0097often vocational, skills-based courses like...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/49/490963_5_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
