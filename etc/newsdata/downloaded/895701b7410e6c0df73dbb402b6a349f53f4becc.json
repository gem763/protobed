It would link up with databases containing records for everything from passports to fingerprints to help India\u2019s depleted police force identify criminals, missing persons and dead bodies.\n\nThe government says the move is designed to help one of the world\u2019s most understaffed police forces, which has one officer for every 724 citizens -- well below global norms. It also could be a boon for companies: TechSci Research estimates India\u2019s facial recognition market will grow sixfold by 2024 to $4.3 billion, nearly on par with China.\n\nBut the project is also ringing alarm bells in a nation with no data privacy laws and a government that just shut down the internet for the last seven weeks in the key state of Kashmir to prevent unrest. While India is still far from implementing a system that matches China\u2019s ability to use technology to control the population, the lack of proper safeguards opens the door for abuses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only functional democracy which will set up such as system without any data protection or privacy laws,\u201d said Apar Gupta, a Delhi-based lawyer and executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a non-profit group whose members successfully lobbied the government in 2015 to ensure net neutrality and reject platforms like Facebook Inc.\u2019s Free Basics. \u201cIt\u2019s like a gold rush for companies seeking large unprotected databases.\u201d\n\nBlack Market\n\nA draft data protection bill presented to the government last year still hasn\u2019t been approved by the cabinet or introduced into parliament. The country has already had problems implementing Aadhaar, one of the world\u2019s biggest biometric databases linking everything from bank accounts to income tax filings, which been plagued by reports of data leaks and the growth of a black market for personal information.\n\nSo far, not much is known about which companies might bid on the facial-recognition system. Minutes of a meeting with potential bidders, obtained by the Internet Freedom Foundation through a right to information request, showed unidentified companies sought clarifications on integrating facial recognition data with state databases and whether it should be able to identify people with plastic surgery.\n\nVasudha Gupta, a spokeswoman for the Home Ministry, didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comments about the system.\n\nFor some in the police force, the system will be an essential tool to fight crime if implemented properly. India has seen more than 100 terrorist attacks in the last three decades, including one on luxury hotels and a train station in Mumbai that killed 166 people in 2008.\n\n\u2018Powerful Tool\u2019\n\nNilabh Kishore, who headed a unit fighting organized crime in the state of Punjab until last year, had success against gangsters after he set up a system linking data from police stations across the state.\n\n\u201cA system that can identify criminals is invaluable -- facial recognition is a powerful tool,\u201d said Kishore, who is now deputy inspector general of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. \u201cBut human intentions are also very important. You can make the best of technology, but if human intentions are wrong it can be a tool for misuse.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s particularly a worry for vulnerable minority groups that have long faced discrimination in India. Lower castes and tribals account for about a quarter of the population but constitute 34% of India\u2019s prisoners, according to the National Dalit Movement for Justice.\n\nIn January, the Delhi High Court said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201c that facial recognition had not helped trace any of the 5,000 children missing from the city in three years. Earlier this month, photos and phone numbers from a Madurai city police facial recognition database in the southern state of Tamil Nadu were leaked online.\n\nSurveillance Threat\n\nThe threat of foreign spying is also persistent. Last month a federal government think tank criticized the local administration in Delhi for hiring the Indian arm of Chinese firm Hikvision to set up 150,000 CCTVs, saying the move could spur illegal hacking and data leaks to the Chinese government.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- India is planning to set up one of the world\u2019s largest facial recognition systems, potentially a lucrative opportunity for surveillance companies and a nightmare for privacy advocates who fear it will lead to a Chinese-style Orwellian state.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government will", "authors": ["Archana Chaudhary"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LjNnkmofyW27OQSVyocX6g--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/21ab1d5a16fa9557596d98874dbab37d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
