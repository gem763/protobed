The investor, which has tangled with Samsung Electronics Co. and the Argentine government, also suggested that AT&T name new directors to its board.\n\nThe start of a public battle will test shareholder support for Chairman and Chief Executive Randall Stephenson \u2019s plans to remake AT&T into a media and advertising powerhouse. He has used big takeovers to add properties such as HBO, Warner Bros. and DirecTV, and is seeking to compete with Comcast Corp. as well as Netflix Inc. in the battle for consumers\u2019 attention. But the deals have also left AT&T with more than $160 billion of net debt.\n\nAT&T's Strategic Shift CEO Randall Stephenson took over AT&T in 2007 shortly after the company had acquired BellSouth and the Cingular Wireless joint venture. He has expanded into media by buying DirecTV in 2015 and Time Warner in 2018.

Other 5%\u2020\n\n\u201cAT&T has suffered from operational and execution issues over the past decade, for which the current leadership team is accountable,\u201d Elliott wrote in a letter to AT&T\u2019s board and made public Monday.\n\nAT&T defended its strategic direction and said it will engage with the hedge fund. \u201cIndeed, many of the actions outlined are ones we are already executing today,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nElliott began laying the groundwork for its campaign last year when AT&T\u2019s shares sagged in the wake of its Time Warner acquisition, though the firm decided to go public after AT&T promoted one of Mr. Stephenson\u2019s lieutenants to be his likely successor, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAT&T last week elevated John Stankey, a longtime executive who advocated for both the DirecTV and Time Warner deals, to be its president and chief operating officer. He was promoted after telecom chief John Donovan, who oversaw more than 80% of the parent company\u2019s revenue, announced his retirement after it became clear he would not succeed the CEO.\n\nElliott questioned the executive change and asked whether AT&T conducted an external review for the new No. 2 position. \u201cEspecially given the recent management changes, this is the moment to determine the right team for the next decade,\u201d Elliott wrote.\n\nAT&T wasn\u2019t given much advance notice of Elliott\u2019s plan, and Mr. Stephenson had yet to meet with its portfolio managers early Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. AT&T has a history of making big acquisitions and of choosing its top managers from within. Elliott criticized both practices in its letter Monday.\n\nElliott didn\u2019t ask AT&T to sell specific divisions but said the company should review any businesses that don\u2019t fit its future direction, including the DirecTV satellite service and Mexican wireless operations. The investor added that the company \u201chas yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT&T needs to own Time Warner.\u201d\n\nWith a market value of more than $260 billion, the Dallas company is among the hedge fund\u2019s biggest corporate targets to date. Elliott\u2019s roughly 1% stake means it will probably need support from other institutional investors to pressure the company.\n\nAT&T shares, which have lagged behind the broader market and some of its peers over the past five years, have rallied in recent months after starting the year around $30. AT&T shares closed up 1.5% at $36.79 in Monday trading.\n\nElliott assailed AT&T management for its nearly $50 billion purchase of DirecTV in 2015 and said it remains cautious about last year\u2019s roughly $80 billion purchase of Time Warner. AT&T has replaced most of the leadership at Time Warner as it prepares to launch a new streaming service.\n\n\u201cAT&T has been an outlier in terms of its M&A strategy,\u201d Elliott wrote. \u201cMost companies today no longer seek to assemble conglomerates.\u201d\n\nThe company is the No. 2 U.S. cellphone carrier by subscribers, trailing rival Verizon Communications Inc., and the top provider of pay-TV channels just ahead of Comcast. It also owns the Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks like CNN and TNT.\n\nAT&T said its \u201cstrategy is driven by the unique portfolio of valuable businesses we\u2019ve assembled across communications networks and media and entertainment.\u201d The company said it would focus on growing and investing in these businesses.\n\nPresident Trump, a frequent critic of CNN, weighed in on the news, tweeting: \u201cGreat news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T.\u201d As a presidential candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump vowed to block AT&T\u2019s takeover of Time Warner. The U.S. Justice Department in 2017 sued to stop the merger, but AT&T prevailed in court after months of costly litigation.\n\nElliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, is one of the biggest activist investors. Last year, the hedge fund launched the equivalent of nearly one new public activism campaign every two weeks, pushing for change at companies around the world including Sempra Energy , Nielsen Holdings PLC and Pernod Ricard SA .\n\nIn its AT&T letter, Elliott argues the company has underperformed the market for the past decade and puts much of the blame on Mr. Stephenson\u2019s acquisition strategy.\n\nIn addition to asset sales, Elliott called on AT&T to boost its profit margins by cutting at least $5 billion in costs, including outsourcing some functions, consolidating offices and trimming its retail footprint.\n\nThe hedge fund predicted that if AT&T pursues the strategic and operational improvements Elliott suggests, the shares could be worth more than $60 a share by the end of 2021. Shares hit a multiyear low of $27.36 in December as investors questioned whether its heavy debt load was sustainable. The company has spent the past year shoring up its balance sheet, partly through sales of assets.\n\n\u2014Corrie Driebusch contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "description": "Activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T, criticized the company\u2019s strategy and called on the telecommunications giant to shed unnecessary assets.
