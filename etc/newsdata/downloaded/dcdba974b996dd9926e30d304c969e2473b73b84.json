Yet, sometime in 2019, almost all of America finally got \u201cwoke\u201d on China.\n\nFor years, our leaders had yawned about Silk Road neo-imperialism in Africa and Asia, and gross abuses of human rights against Chinese religious minorities and political dissidents.\n\nAlmost every assumption Washington made, both by Democratic and Republican administrations, was logically flawed at best. And at worst, these calculations were a weird mix of conservative commercial greed, liberal political correctness and shared screwball naivete.\n\nAmerican trade and political appeasement were never interpreted by Beijing as magnanimity to be reciprocated, but always as weakness to be exploited. It was always ludicrous to think that the more concessions on trade and human rights the United States gave, the more China would Westernize and begin to resemble America or an EU nation.\n\nEven sillier was the old shibboleth that China\u2019s embrace of capitalist reforms \u2014 as if by some unwritten, determinist economic law \u2014 would lead to constitutional government. But the ability to buy a new cellphone never ensures the right to vote for a candidate of one\u2019s choice.\n\nInstead, all China did was auction off large sections of its new and more efficient economy to crony Communist pseudo-capitalists and corrupt provincial officials in order to modernize the country, beef up the military, warp the international trading system \u2014 and make itself very rich.\n\nWhy did America act in such a suicidal way on China?\n\nCheap Chinese labor and lax American laws motivated hundreds of U.S. corporations to shut down their domestic assembly plants and relocate to China. At least at first, they were free to pay substandard wages and were mostly unregulated.\n\nOnce American businesses got hooked on mega-profits, the Chinese government slowly started stealing their technology, infringing on copyrights and patents, dumping their own merchandise on the world market at prices below production costs, running up huge trade surpluses and manipulating their currency.\n\nBut by then, American corporations were so addicted to laissez-faire profit-making that they turned a blind eye and paid their hush money.\n\nUniversities cashed in too, both by setting up lucrative satellite campuses in China and admitting tens of thousands of Chinese citizens. These Chinese students paid full tuition (and sometimes premiums and surcharges), turning once cash-strapped campuses into profitable degree mills.\n\nMost college deans and presidents simply ignored the dreadful human rights record of China, not to mention occasional expatriate espionage rings designed to steal engineering and high-tech research.\n\nIf profits had blinded corporations to exploitive Chinese partnerships, political correctness conveniently offered academia and the media political cover \u2014 as if a mostly monoracial China was a 1.3-billion-person diverse \u201cother\u201d with historical grievances against a supposedly racist America.\n\nThe result was that everyone profited and all remained willfully blind to the ascendant cutthroat and dictatorial colossus.\n\nThe domestic winners in the appeasement of Communist China were the two American coasts \u2014 the New York financial industry, the Washington political lobbying nexus, Silicon Valley\u2019s high-tech companies, and the coastal mega-research universities such Harvard, Stanford and Yale.\n\nSuddenly, the intellectual and informational classes could sell their wares in a new global market, and they profited enormously.\n\nFew cared about the \u201closers\u201d in the now-hollowed-out Midwest and in rural America. For corporate America, domestic muscular labor could be easily and cheaply replaced by millions of Chinese workers. Outsourcing and offshoring pulled investment capital out of America and put it overseas, as Chinese-assembled products brought far greater profits.\n\nAcademics could not have cared less that the deplorables and the working classes were being wiped out, given their politically incorrect social and cultural views.\n\nWhat finally woke America up were two unforeseen developments.\n\nFirst, the Chinese overreached and systematically began militarizing neutral islands in the South China Sea. They derided international commercial treaties.\n\nIn racist fashion, they treated Asian and African countries as if they were 19th-century colonies. And they unapologetically lifted technology from America\u2019s biggest and most powerful corporations to turn China into something akin to George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing began rounding up dissidents, cracking down in Hong Kong and \u201cre-educating\u201d millions of Muslims in detention camps. All that brazenness finally drove the left to drop its multicultural blinders and accept the truth of renegade Chinese oppression.\n\nSecond, Donald Trump got elected president, all the while screaming that the Chinese emperor had no clothes. The cheerleaders finally listened and admitted that China had been buck naked after all.\n\nNow we will learn whether America woke up just in time or too late. Either way, no one will credit the loud Trump for warning that China was threatening not just the United States but the world as we have known it.\n\n\u2022 Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of \u201cThe Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won\u201d (Basic Books, 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
