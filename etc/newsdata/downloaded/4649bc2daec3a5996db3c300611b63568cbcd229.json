Mariota's numbers into the third quarter: 7 of 18 for 63 yards passing. Mariota also was intercepted twice for his first turnovers of the season. Denver sacked Mariota three times after he was sacked 22 times through the first five games.\n\nTannehill was acquired by the Titans in a trade with Miami in March to back up Mariota, the No. 2 pick overall in the 2015 draft.\n\n___\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nBroncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders has been ruled out for the second half against Tennessee with a knee injury.\n\nSanders had one catch for no yards in the first half.\n\nThe 32-year-old Sanders has 24 receptions for 298 yards and two touchdowns this season in his comeback from left Achilles tendon surgery and an operation on his right ankle.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nDallas kicker Brett Maher has tied his own franchise record by kicking a 62-yard field goal \u2014 with plenty of room to spare \u2014 as the first half ended cutting the Cowboys' deficit against the New York Jets to 21-6.\n\nIt was also the longest field goal ever made against the Jets.\n\nMaher also booted a 62-yarder against the Eagles last December.\n\nDenver's Matt Prater holds the NFL record for longest field goal, kicking a 64-yarder in 2013.\n\n\u2014 Dennis Waszak reporting from East Rutherford, New Jersey\n\n___\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nBroncos kicker Brandon McManus broke a streak of seven straight misses from 50 or more yards when he connected from 53 late in the first half against Tennessee.\n\nHe also made a 31-yarder in this low-scoring affair.\n\nThe Broncos were out of sorts on special teams most of the first half. They had to call timeout before a Tennessee punt in the first quarter because they had only 10 players on the field.\n\nThen, right before McManus' 53-yard attempt, they had to call another one with the play clock to avoid a delay of game penalty.\n\n___\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nTwo high-flying offenses have made big mistakes in the first half of a defensive struggle between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSan Francisco and Los Angeles are tied 7-7 at halftime after both teams committed turnovers at their opponents' 1.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo threw a terrible interception to Marcus Peters to kill a strong drive by San Francisco. The Rams then got stopped for no gain on two running plays from the Niners 1.\n\nSan Francisco is struggling to establish a running game without both of its starting offensive tackles, while the Rams have just 27 yards passing even though they're missing star running back Todd Gurley.\n\n___\n\n5:28 p.m.\n\nKyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals are flying through Atlanta's defense.\n\nMurray has hit 16 of 19 passes for 240 yards and a touchdown, helping the Cardinals build a 20-10 halftime lead over the Falcons.\n\nAtlanta opened the game with an 80-yard drive, capped by Matt Ryan's 9-yard TD pass to Calvin Ridley. Matt Bryant also kicked a late 29-yard field goal.\n\nMurray hit Chase Edmonds on a 2-yard TD pass and David Johnson scored on a 1-yard run.\n\nZane Gonzalez kicked his second field goal, from 22 yards, in the final seconds of the half.\n\n___\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nDallas Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper is questionable to return against the New York Jets with a quadriceps injury.\n\nCooper left the game late in the first quarter and was on the sideline without his helmet early in the second quarter. He had one catch for 3 yards.\n\nThe Cowboys' leading receiver was limited at practice last week with ankle and quad ailments. Cooper was coming off a career-high 226 yards receiving against Green Bay. He has 33 receptions for 515 yards and five touchdowns this season.\n\n\u2014 Dennis Waszak reporting from East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\n___\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nRichard Sherman made sure nobody would question his pregame handshake etiquette this week.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers cornerback gave humorously exaggerated handshakes to the Los Angeles Rams' captains during the coin toss before their meeting at the Coliseum.\n\nSherman claimed last week that Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield didn't shake his hand before the game, even though he did. Sherman used the imagined slight as motivation in the 49ers' Monday night victory.\n\n___\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nInjuries are mounting for the Texans in their game against Kansas City.\n\nRight tackle Tytus Howard was carted off the field on the opening possession of the second half with a knee injury. A few plays later, cornerback Bradley Roby left with a hamstring injury.\n\nTexans linebacker Zach Cunningham left in the first half with a knee injury.\n\nMeanwhile, the Texans' Ka'imi Fairbairn has missed a field goal, and Kansas City has answered with Tyreek Hill's second TD catch of the game, giving the Chiefs a 24-23 lead late in the third quarter.\n\n\u2014 Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City, Missouri\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nThe Texans lead the Chiefs 23-17 at halftime of a punt-free foul-fest in Kansas City.\n\nThe teams have combined for 14 penalties for 114 yards, the most fouls in any half of any NFL game this season. That doesn't include another six penalties that were offsetting, overruled or declined.\n\nDeshaun Watson has touchdowns throwing and rushing for the Texans, who closed the first half by scoring 20 unanswered points. They punctuated it with a strip-sack of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes with 23 seconds remaining that set them up for Watson's short TD run.\n\n\u2014 Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n___\n\n2:43 p.m.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings have used two long touchdown passes by Kirk Cousins to Stefon Diggs to take a 24-10 halftime lead on the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nDiggs scored on plays covering 51 and 62 yards, becoming the first Vikings player since Randy Moss in 2000 to post two touchdown receptions of 50-plus yards in one game. Cousins has three touchdown passes and 209 yards at the break.\n\nIn three home games this year, the Vikings have outscored their opponents in the first half by a combined score of 66-17,\n\n\u2014 Dave Campbell reporting from Minneapolis\n\n___\n\n2:40 p.m.\n\nThe Denver Broncos are honoring their two latest Hall of Fame inductees at halftime of the game against the Titans.\n\nHall of Fame president David Baker will present the Hall of Fame rings to Champ Bailey and family members of the late Pat Bowlen.\n\nAlso, Bailey is being inducted as the 33rd member of the Broncos' Ring of Fame.\n\nBailey unveiled his 8-foot bronze pillar outside the stadium Friday night.\n\nHe becomes the first Bronco inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the team's Ring of Fame the same year.\n\n\u2014 Arnie Stapleton reporting from Denver.\n\n___\n\n2:35 p.m.\n\nThe NFL wanted to make kickers work harder to make extra points, and it's working. Three extra points already have been missed by halftime for a total of 24 missed PATs for the season.\n\nThat's a new high through six weeks since the NFL moved the spot for extra points back. The previous high was 22 last year and also in 2016.\n\nTwo extra points were missed in Cleveland with Seahawks kicker Jason Myers missing the extra point after Russell Wilson ran for a 16-yard TD for Seattle in the first quarter, then Browns rookie Austin Seibert missed the extra point in the opening seconds of the second quarter leaving Cleveland's lead at 20-6.\n\nKa'imi Fairbairn of the Texans missed the third extra point and his fourth this season after a touchdown pass by Deshaun Watson, leaving Houston trailing Kansas City 17-9. Fairbairn missed only two extra points all last season when he led the NFL in scoring.\n\n___\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nBengals cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick has been taken off the field on a cart after hurting his left knee late in the first quarter against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nKirkpatrick was injured while making a sideline tackle on tight end Mark Andrews. Kirkpatrick came into the game ranked sixth on the team in tackles and with one of Cincy's six sacks. His return is questionable.\n\n\u2014 Dave Ginsburg reporting from Baltimore.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nWelcome back, Tyreek Hill.\n\nThe Chiefs' two-time All-Pro outjumped Texans cornerback Phillip Gaines and safety Justin Reid to haul in a 46-yard touchdown reception to punctuate Hill's first drive since Week 1.\n\nHill had been sidelined with a broken clavicle sustained against the Jaguars.\n\nThe Chiefs were penalized four times on their opening drive, which started at their 9-yard line. So by the end of the drive, Patrick Mahomes already had thrown for 116 yards and the touchdown.\n\n\u2014 Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nThe early games have started off with a burst. Literally.\n\nBrandon Wilson took the opening kickoff in Baltimore 92 yards for a touchdown, giving Cincinnati a 7-0 lead over the Ravens. Wilson and the Bengals made Baltimore pay for a rare kickoff that Justin Tucker didn't put out of the end zone.\n\nThat's the first opening kick returned for a touchdown in the NFL in two years. Pharoh Wilson did it with a 103-yard return in a Rams' win over the Jaguars in Week 6 in 2017.\n\nIn Cleveland, Dontrell Hilliard didn't reach the end zone on Seattle's opening kickoff. But Hilliard went 74 yards down to the Seahawks 23, and Nick Chubb scored three plays later with the Browns taking advantage of the big return.\n\n___\n\nNoon\n\nThe New Orleans Saints got an unexpected \u2014 and probably unintentional \u2014 backer for their game at Jacksonville.\n\nPope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, included the Saints' Twitter logo in a tweet Sunday morning \u2014 one New Orleans football fans took as a good omen for their team.\n\n\"Today we give thanks to the Lord for our new #Saints. They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession,\" the Pope tweeted after canonizing five new saints at a mass at Vatican City.\n\nThe hashtag and capitalization of Saints added the Fleur de Lis, the emblem associated with the Saints and worn on the team's helmets.\n\nPeople certainly noticed as one person wrote, \"Who Dat, father?\" At least one Saints player took the tweet as a good sign: \"Wow, are we blessed or what?!??\"\n\n\u2014 Mark Long reporting from Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nCarolina's Joey Slye missed a 60-yard attempt on a rare free kick for a field goal at the end of the first half against Tampa Bay.\n\nSlye got his opportunity after the Panthers called for a fair catch at midfield with 1 second left in the half. Tampa Bay had false-started three straight times before the punt.\n\nThe Panthers chose the option of a free kick. That allowed Slye to kick from the 50 with the Bucs players forced to remain 10 yards back. The kick went wide right and Carolina's lead remained 17-7 at the break.\n\nThe Panthers used a franchise-record tying six first-half sacks, three takeaways and two Christian McCaffrey touchdowns to take a 17-7 halftime lead in London against the Bucs.\n\n\u2014 Josh Dubow reporting from London\n\n___\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have taken a 10-0 lead over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers thanks to a short drive and a long one.\n\nCarolina's James Bradberry intercepted Jameis Winston on the first play from scrimmage. The Panthers lost 2 yards before settling for a 49-yard field goal from Joey Slye.\n\nCarolina then drove 99 yards for a touchdown after Bradley Pinion's punt was down at the 1. Kyle Allen went 5-for-5 for 68 yards on the drive and Christian McCaffrey capped it with a 1-yard run on fourth down.\n\nThat was just the second 99-yard drive for Carolina in the past 12 seasons. The Panthers had one last year against Baltimore.\n\nThe Buccaneers hadn't allowed a 99-yard drive since Nov. 7, 2010, against Atlanta.\n\n\u2014 Josh Dubow reporting from London\n\n___\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers got the NFL off to an early start with their meeting in London.\n\nThe two NFC South rivals are playing Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the second of four games this season in London.\n\nCarolina made defensive Efe Obada an honorary captain for the game. The Nigeria native arrived in England as a 10-year-old after being trafficked with his sister from the Netherlands. Now he's back here as an NFL player and a star attraction after first picking up the sport of American football at age 22.\n\nThis marks the Panthers' first regular-season game outside the United States. That leaves the Green Bay Packers as the only team not to have played an International Series game.\n\nSome of the key games in Week 6 after the early start in London include Deshaun Watson and the Houston Texans visiting Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs and an NFC West showdown between the undefeated San Francisco 49ers and the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
