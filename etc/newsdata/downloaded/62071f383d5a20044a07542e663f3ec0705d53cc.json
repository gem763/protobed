New Zealand top the group ahead of South Africa, while both England and France have qualified for the quarter-finals with a game to spare.\n\nEngland, having secured top spot in their group, are likely to meet Australia in the quarter-finals, with France set to play probable pool winners Wales, barring any major upset in the final round of Pool D games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the very difficult but we think right decision to cancel matches,\u201d Gilpin said, adding that Australia v Georgia on Friday and Ireland v Samoa on Saturday would go ahead.\n\n\u201cThe decision to cancel the matches has not been taken lightly and had been taken with the safety of players, supporters, and volunteers\u2019 safety as a priority,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stakes are high for the Scots, who would be eliminated if their match against Japan were to be cancelled, assuming that Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday.\n\nGilpin said World Rugby had no regrets staging the tournament in Japan during typhoon season. \u201cWe always knew there would be risks but it\u2019s rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year. We have no regrets.\u201d\n\nAsked if the integrity of the World Cup had been compromised, he replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe so. There tournament rules are not new. We\u2019ve never had to implement them before.\u201d\n\nGilpin hinted that the Japan v Scotland match would not be rescheduled if the decision is taken to cancel the fixture on Sunday following a safety assessment that morning once the typhoon has passed over the area and headed north.\n\n\u201cItaly are in exactly the same position Scotland are in,\u201d Gilpin said, adding that while Scotland\u2019s meeting with the hosts is a \u201chuge match\u201d that everyone would love to see go ahead, \u201cWe won\u2019t be treating that match, if it can\u2019t be played, any differently.\u201d\n\nGilpin said the risks posed were \u201ctoo challenging\u201d to deliver a fair and consistent approach for all teams and ensure the safety of spectators. Fans with tickets for the two cancelled matches will receive a refund.\n\nAkira Shimazu, the organising committee\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that calling off Japan\u2019s final pool match would prove a huge disappointment to fans expected to fill the 72,000-seat Yokohama stadium and tens of millions of others watching on TV.\n\n\u201cWe will look at the typhoon damage and consider its impact, but we would also like to consider the safety of the spectators,\u201d Shimazu said. \u201cI know people really want to see the match so we will do our best to make sure they are able to do that.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s final pool game against France and New Zealand\u2019s match with Italy have been cancelled while Scotland\u2019s World Cup remains in doubt", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aced59a6bb422e3e886c5624abe11d95dfab725/0_0_4868_2921/master/4868.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a291a1bda20a5f94817539a3909d7b65", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
