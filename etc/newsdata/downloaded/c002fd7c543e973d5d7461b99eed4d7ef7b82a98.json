The perfume\u2019s name? Sauvage, or savage in English, a racial stereotype with a long history of use against Native Americans, including in advertisements.\n\nThe ad touched off a quick reaction on social media, with many accusing the company of deploying an insensitive depiction of Native Americans to sell its wares. The description for the perfume, a classic Dior fragrance that has been remade, says it exudes \u201cwarm oriental tones and wild beauty that comes to life on the skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fragrance of a new frontier: an interpretation with a rich, heady trail that celebrates the magic of wide-open spaces.\u201d\n\nThe company pulled the ad from Twitter after wide backlash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an arrogant appropriation of imagery that is unimaginatively executed,\u201d Hanay Geiogamah, a UCLA professor, playwright and historian who is a member of the Kiowa tribe, told The Washington Post. \u201cWhat offends me is that they so casually appropriate imagery like that and blend it together for their own purposes.\u201d\n\nGeiogamah noted that \u201csavage\u201d is one of the original slurs used against Native Americans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more insulting than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis calls attention to the ongoing reality that the ad industry nationally and internationally still thinks they can appropriate American Indian imagery when they see fit. Here they\u2019re doing it in a very high-gloss way, but it misses the mark completely.\u201d\n\nThe perfume was also featured in a minute-long advertisement on YouTube featuring the actor Johnny Depp playing guitar and the dancer, as well as a three-minute video explaining the creation of the ad campaign.\n\n\u201cThis particular short-film is truly a love letter,\" Depp says in that video. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you can hear the land. There\u2019s something there that speaks to you.\u201d\n\nThose videos, too, were taken down by the company by the end of the day Friday.\n\nHanley Frost, 59, a cultural education coordinator of the Southern Ute tribe in Colorado, blessed the land for the film crew and was filmed in a traditional outfit for one of the videos.\n\nHe said his cousin, an art school graduate, had recommended him for the production after a friend who works in the film business had said a Native American was needed to say a blessing before a film shoot.\n\nHe drove out to the scrubland in Moab, about a three-hour drive from his home in Ignacio, Colo., to bless the area for the crew, unaware at first of any of the details about the production. He found out mid-shoot that it was for the Christian Dior campaign featuring Depp. He also donned a formal outfit he wears for blessings and was filmed by the crew.\n\nAnd he came back another day to teach the crew a bit about the history of his ancestors in the area. He said he was happy to share the history of his people and bless the land before the shoot, saying they eventually asked him what he wanted to be paid for the work. He asked for $1,000, he said.\n\n#Dior is using a Native American dancing in traditional regalia to promote their \"Sauvage\" cologne. It's 2019.\n\n\n\nWe must ask ourselves.

It\u2019s never going to go away. No matter how much people complain about it,\u201d he said, noting sports teams such as the Washington Redskins that have used Native American imagery. \u201cI know some native tribes, they say that\u2019s what they called us, to educate the natives, but you know, that\u2019s back in the past.\u201d\n\nFor the ad, Dior worked with Americans for Indian Opportunity, a Native American advocacy organization whose president adopted Depp, who has long said he has Native American heritage, into her family around the time he played the Native American character Tonto in Disney\u2019s remake of \u201cThe Lone Ranger.\u201d (The portrayal was controversial.) A tribal chairman, John Wauqua, certified Depp as an honorary citizen of the Comanche Nation, but his affiliation and ethnic claims have been heavily criticized by Native American scholars such as Geiogamah.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not Native American,\u201d Geiogamah said.\n\nThe absurdity of the @Dior #Sauvage Ad w/ Johnny Depp:\n\n\u2022 Supposedly anti-appropriation, but goes balls deep in appropriation.\n\n\u2022 Titles the actress as maiden & the native actor, warrior.\n\n\u2022 Says it is helping Native folx, but invokes stupid/ignorant \"indian\" tropes.\n\n... \u2014 Dallas Goldtooth (@dallasgoldtooth) August 30, 2019\n\nLaura Harris, the AIO\u2019s executive director, told The Post that her organization was proud of its work with Dior.\n\n\u201cThe goals of Americans for Indian Opportunity (AIO) for providing consultations on media productions are to ensure inclusion of paid Native staff, artists, actors, writers etc., to educate the production teams on Native American contemporary realities and to create allies for Indigenous peoples,\u201d she wrote to The Post. \u201cAIO does not speak for all Native Americans. We are proud to have successfully achieved our goals of education and inclusion for this project with Parfums Christian Dior.\u201d\n\n[\u2018I was the person who made the mistake\u2019: How Gucci is trying to recover from its blackface sweater controversy]\n\nConcerns about cultural appropriation are front and center in the world of fashion, where the drive to push the envelope and elevate personal style through edgy or exotic themes has led to numerous controversies over the years.
