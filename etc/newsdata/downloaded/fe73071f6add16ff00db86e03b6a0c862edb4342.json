For a lot of people, including me, that means doing [thing] while listening to a podcast. Ever since Apple Arcade launched last month, I\u2019ve wanted to play many of those games while listening to someone explain why Halloween III: Season of the Witch will eventually be seen as a classic, but it\u2019s mostly been impossible because so many of those games explicitly block it and play the game's music instead. I like the music in Grindstone well enough, but 15 hours later, I wanna hear about Silver Shamrock!!!\n\nFortunately, it looks like that might be changing, at least for some games. As part of an update shrinking Grindstone\u2019s file size and other bugs, it also lifted this odd audio restriction:\n\nIt totally works, too. I downloaded the update a few minutes ago and podcasts worked fine.\n\nThis annoyance has actually been on my radar for a few weeks now. Did Apple mandate this? Is part of the Apple Arcade experience supposed to be games that fully demand your attention, and splitting duties with a podcast is somehow seen as diluting the experience?\n\nThe answer is no, and after talking with a few developers, a simpler explanation emerged. While this isn\u2019t true for every game on Apple Arcade, a lot of them are built in the Unity engine. By default, there\u2019s a checkbox called \u201cmute other audio sources,\u201d which does exactly what\u2019s happening here: the game will take priority over any other audio, including a podcast. Developers need to consciously uncheck that box in order for things to work in harmony.\n\nThis is also why another popular Apple Arcade release, What the Golf, has the same problem. I\u2019ve been told a patch to address this is coming for What the Golf eventually, too.\n\nBut like I said: this isn\u2019t the case for every game! Sometimes, the sound-blocking setting is enabled on purpose.\n\n\u201cThis was actually intentional, as the sound and music in Where Cards Fall help create the game\u2019s unique atmosphere, and we wanted to make sure all of our players experience them,\u201d said Built By Snowman founder and creative director Ryan Cash. \u201cIn Skate City, another game we have in Apple Arcade, players can listen to their own music or podcasts.\u201d\n\nI think developers should just let people do what they want, rather than trying to dictate how to use their device. Maybe they\u2019re playing the game a second time. Who knows? But there\u2019s a lot of games where it seems like they\u2019d have no problem with players multitasking, and thankfully, there might be an understandable reason it\u2019s not possible\u2014and might get fixed.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter.
