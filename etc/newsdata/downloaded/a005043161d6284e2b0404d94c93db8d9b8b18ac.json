It also supports custom model development, validation, monitoring, and execution alongside a range of off-the-shelf loss-forecasting models. In this case, VyStar will benefit from models featured in the Moody\u2019s Analytics CMM\u2122 (Commercial Mortgage Metrics), Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer, and Auto Portfolio Analyzer solutions, among others.\n\nThe Jacksonville, Florida-based credit union will use the Moody\u2019s Analytics CECL solution between now and the 2023 implementation date to analyze their current loan portfolio and the risks and opportunities that CECL presents. They also plan to use it for a greater understanding of how CECL will affect their balance sheet growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cAs standard-setters have advised, we are viewing the extended deadline as an opportunity to further refine and go beyond the standard requirements,\u201d said Sam Sohi, Financial Risk Manager at VyStar Credit Union. \u201cWe will use the extra time to build a strong overall credit risk framework to inform our business strategy. Moody\u2019s Analytics offered the best solution to manage the ramifications of CECL as we continue to grow.\u201d\n\nLast year, Moody\u2019s Analytics earned the Category Leader distinction in a Chartis Research report evaluating leading vendors of CECL solutions, and in 2019 Moody\u2019s Analytics earned a CECL category win in the Chartis RiskTech100\u00ae.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing many 2023 CECL adopters seizing the opportunity from the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s extension to enhance their broader credit risk infrastructure, from origination through reporting,\u201d said Eric Ebel, Managing Director at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe look forward to working with VyStar as they establish best-in-class credit-risk processes with the help of our CECL solution.\u201d\n\nClick here to learn more about the ImpairmentStudio solution.\n\nAbout Moody\u2019s Analytics\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics provides financial intelligence and analytical tools to help business leaders make better, faster decisions.
