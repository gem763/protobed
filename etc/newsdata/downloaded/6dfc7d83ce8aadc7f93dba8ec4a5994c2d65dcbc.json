Free Speech, Someone?", "language": "en", "text": "The state administration in turmoil-afflicted Jammu and Kashmir is reportedly asking the detainees in the Kashmir valley to sign a bond that prohibits them from opposing \u201cthe recent events\u201d if they wish to secure their release.\n\nThe only other option they apparently have is, of course, to continue to remain detained.\n\nA copy of the bond that detainees are allegedly being forced to sign in Jammu and Kashmir. The Telegraph\n\nAccording to media reports on Monday, the bond in question is a tweaked version of a standard document that potential troublemakers are asked to sign under Section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nThe requirement to sign the bond is for the detainees to agree that they will \u201cnot make any comment(s) or issue statement(s) or make public speech(s) hold or participate in public assembly(s) related to recent events in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, at the present time, since it has the potential of endangering the peace and tranquillity and law and order in the state or any part thereof for a period of one year\u201d.\n\nFurther, they are required to make a deposit of Rs 10,000 as surety, and if they breach the bond, they will be required to pay Rs 40,000.\n\nDon't Miss 254 SHARES 861 SHARES 675 SHARES 480 SHARES\n\nRepresentational Image/BCCL\n\nEarlier this month, Ijtija Mufti, who is the daughter of the detained former chief minister and People\u2019s Democratic Party leader, Mehbooba Mufti, had claimed that \u201cthe authorities are also blackmailing them (political leaders) to sign similar \u2018bonds\u2019.\n\nNotably, the bond that has been quoted extensively by media reports mentions that it is for \u201cpresent time\u201d that adds to \u201ca period of one year\u201d.\n\nWhile several factors must be taken into consideration given the turmoil that the Kashmir valley is currently in post the abrogation of Article 370 to maintain law and order situation in the region as well as to foil the attempts by terror outfits, it is also worth noting that freedom of speech is most crucial at such junctures as it is the only weapon that subjects have to register their grievances.\n\nRepresentational Image/BCCL\n\nThere is no denying that it has not been misused and abused by pro-Pakistan as well as separatist elements in the valley but a wound in our body does not demand that it be cut off completely.\n\nMore than anything else, free speech is upheld in India\u2019s Constitution but the manner in which the recent events such as this have manifested themselves is, at the very least, a travesty of all promises India as a nation makes to its citizens.", "description": "Earlier this month, Ijtija Mufti, who is the daughter of the detained former chief minister and People\u2019s Democratic Party leader, Mehbooba Mufti, had claimed that \u201cthe authorities are also blackmailing them (political leaders) to sign similar \u2018bonds\u2019.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/bonds_prohibit_detainees_in_kashmir_from_holding_meetings_or_speaking_against_article_370_free_spee_1571655794_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
