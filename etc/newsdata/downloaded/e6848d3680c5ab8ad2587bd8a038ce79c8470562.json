Most of us go overboard on cheat days, don\u2019t we? I mean, is it even possible to take control of a cheat day and not kill the progress you\u2019ve made so far.\n\nSara Ali Khan and mom Amrita Singh are just like us. Sara, who is busy shooting for her next movie Coolie no. 1, a remake of Govinda and Karisma Kapoor\u2019s classic film, took some time out from her busy schedule to bond with mommy. And they both showed us the joy of bonding over food.\n\nTwitter\n\nFor their cheat meal, they ordered an enormous Dosa. Amrita Singh was a little embarrassed. So much so, she hide her face from the camera as Sara pokes fun at her and asks \u201cHi mom we\u2019re live on Instagram. Why are you eating like this today? What\u2019s gone wrong?\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 289 SHARES 8.8 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 1.9 K SHARES\n\nShe is of course referring to the huge Dosa that is placed on the table. \u201cWhen mommy and I set out to eat, We don\u2019t care about the diet-only cheat, Eating like this isn\u2019t extraordinary it\u2019s no feat, Even food competitors should shut up and give us their seat! #KushtiKiTayari #bharisawari #merimapyaari #sarakishayari,\u201d she wrote as she posted the video on Instagram. But did you guys finish the meal?\n\nSara isn\u2019t the only one. Kartik Aaryan sometime ago couldn\u2019t control himself from eating sinfully delicious Kachoris in Lucknow. He was surrounded by so many fans as he stepped out to eat Kachoris from a local vendor. One of the fans even told him that he shouldn\u2019t be eating Kachoris as they are too \u201coily\u201d and that his \u201cskin kharab ho jayegi\u201d. But he tells them that his skin will instead glow. Watch in the video below.\n\nWhat are you planning to eat on your next cheat day?
