A 500-lb. bomb body was flown in 1918, and the F-35 is now dropping these. You can\u2019t have an airplane and not have the same generation of munitions associated with it\u201d Maj. Gen. Larry Stutzriem, USAF (Ret.) said at the Air Force Association Air, Space & Cyber Conference.\n\nNaturally, seeker technology and advances with guidance systems and targeting are vastly different than they were years ago. Yet, the fundamental configurations, or bomb structures themselves, have been somewhat stagnant, service observers say.\n\nStutzriem, a former fighter pilot and current Director of Research for the Mitchell Institute, cited research now exploring precision bomb technology intended to pursue weapons technologies with more precision and \u201cvariable-yield effects\u201d\n\nCurrent areas of inquiry, according to the Mitchell Institute\u2019s study, explain that, for decades, most bombs have operated with \u201cfixed-explosive envelopes.\u201d As a result, current developers are looking for innovative methods of achieving increased lethality with precision and variable yields\u2014meaning bombs can be configured to tailor explosions depending on the target.\n\nAs co-author of the Mitchell Institute study, Stutzriem characterized the research as an effort to seek wider explosive ranges through a \u201ccombination of heat blast and fragmentation.\u201d\n\nDeveloping what Air Force engineers call \u201cflight selectability\u201d is essential to these developmental efforts, as it will enable dynamic combat-targeting to adapt while an aircraft is airborne. This can be done with a range of technologies to enable improved precision using multi-mode energetics and specialized structures engineered into the warhead itself, Col. Gary Haase, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), said at AFA.\n\nAlso, developers are working on smart-fusing embedded in a weapon providing an explosive range from a wide-area effect to a lower collateral damage effect, Stutzriem and Haase said.\n\n\u201cThe concept is to have selectable effects munitions capability in the cockpit,\u201d Stutzriem explained.\n\nThese kinds of technical advances, wherein munitions can be adjusted in-flight, are inspiring new thinking when it comes to Concepts of Operations (CONOPS). Newer targeting and explosive yield variation naturally changes the types of attack missions falling within the realm of the possible. For instance, if a weapon could be configured for a larger or lower blast-effect in flight, an aircraft could attack more targets, have more options or make adjustments much more easily amid fast-changing combat situations.\n\nRecommended: Forget the F-35: The Tempest Could Be the Future\n\nRecommended: Why No Commander Wants to Take On a Spike Missile\n\nRecommended: What Will the Sixth-Generation Jet Fighter Look Like?\n\nRecommended: Imagine a U.S. Air Force That Never Built the B-52 Bomber\n\n\u201cThere is a compelling needed for a new regime of munitions for expanded effects,\u201d according to Haase.\n\nAir Force bomb developers specifically cited a promising weapon designed to encompass many of these attributes; an adaptable carbon fiber bomb called the BLU 129 was developed for the specific need to create low collateral damage. At the same time, the weapon is said to be extremely lethal and is referred to as having \u201cthe world\u2019s largest sniper accuracy with controlled field effects.\n\nIn an analysis of the weapon, Globalsecurity.org writes \u201cthe BLU-129/B is a 500lb bomb body that is made from carbon fibers, instead of traditional steel. This 500lb bomb body will be joined to JDAM tailkits, and eventually other weapon tailkits that interface with the standard 500lb bomb body shape.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Air Force researchers and bomb-makers are expressing concerns that the modernization of air-dropped weapons has been lagging-behind the many technical advances built into the larger platforms that drop them, such as the B-2, F-35 and the emerging B-21.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iqHibewj6dTRfy2EWR9cBw--~B/aD05NTg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/2dd3374ae84da9a196c47e4e46b345e9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
