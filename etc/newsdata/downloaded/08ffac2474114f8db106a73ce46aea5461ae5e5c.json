Council races \u2014 or the council itself?", "language": "en", "text": "Political eyes are focused on the 2020 elections, when voters get to decide whether to elect a new president and vice president or keep the ones they have. The presidential race, however, is not the only game in town.\n\nIn 2020, the District has races of its own to decide.\n\nUnlike the fight for the White House, which gets decided on Nov. 3, six of the seven D.C. contests will be effectively resolved months earlier, on June 2. That is primary election day, and in this heavily Democratic town, a Democratic primary victory is tantamount to clinching the general election.\n\nThe exception to this is one of the two races for at-large D.C. Council seats, which will be decided in the general election under terms of the Home Rule Act.\n\nOf the seven city contests, the election for delegate to the House of Representatives is least likely to be an attention-getter. The incumbent, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), has decided to seek a 16th term. Unless an experienced and exceptionally skilled figure appears out of nowhere, Norton\u2019s a shoo-in. Newbies get nowhere against her.\n\nThe six remaining ballot entries (representing nearly half of the 13-member council) are on the market: two at-large council seats and the Wards 2, 4, 7 and 8 seats, occupied, respectively, by David Grosso (I), Robert C. White Jr. (D), Jack Evans (D), Brandon T. Todd (D), Vincent C. Gray (D) and Trayon White Sr. (D).\n\nAt issue: Do today\u2019s D.C. voters much care about these council races \u2014 or the council itself?\n\nMaybe the reason people in the District don\u2019t seem to care is that they thought D.C. government had been pretty much cleaned up after the scandals of 2012 and 2013, when council members Michael A. Brown, Kwame R. Brown and Harry Thomas Jr. pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges, Marion Barry got censured for taking cash from contractors with business before the council and Jim Graham got reprimanded for intervening in the city lottery. Those folks are long out of office.\n\nBut the D.C. government\u2019s problems are far from over.\n\nJust this year, the longest-serving council member, Evans, has faced a federal investigation, an FBI raid on his home and a $20,000 ethics board fine for using his position as a lawmaker for personal gain; he lost his seats on the Metro board and the finance committee.\n\nMeanwhile, the District has become a contract hustler\u2019s paradise: Note the disgusting award of a rigged, sole-source $215 million contract to operate sports betting in the city.\n\nGovernment oversight is a major council responsibility. D.C. lawmakers should be monitoring the actions of the executive branch, including programs and policies implemented by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and her administration. The council, on behalf of taxpayers, ought to be examining whether programs are performing as intended, within both the budget and the law.\n\nNot so on this council\u2019s watch, under the insipid and irresolute leadership of Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). Members, by and large, seem more interested in aggrandizing themselves \u2014 which they do to perfection and often at each other\u2019s expense \u2014 than in taking oversight seriously.\n\nConcerns about waste, fraud and abuse seem to have taken a holiday. Predatory landlords have been having a field day, at the expense of tenants, while D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs housing inspectors collect paychecks while skating through their jobs. The council whimpers.\n\nThen there\u2019s gun violence: children afraid to walk to and from school and bodies falling all over town. The media\u2019s new standard of measurement: Are shootings \u201cnon-life-threatening\u201d? City leadership\u2019s solution? Free Metro and bus rides for kids, and send in city-paid violence \u201cinterrupters.\u201d\n\nA deputy mayor for education and schools chancellor are forced to split the scene after bypassing the school system\u2019s competitive lottery system. Inflated graduation rates exposed by the media. School budget overruns detected by the city auditor. Hand-wringing at the council.\n\nOn top of that, the council now has a solid bloc of lawmakers who are more responsive to outside cause-oriented special interests than to the general public. Think decriminalizing of prostitution, guaranteeing universal paid family leave and making the District a medical marijuana mecca.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s look at who\u2019s on deck next year.\n\nEvans told me he has not decided whether to seek reelection. I\u2019m told the only Evans fundraising now underway is for contributions to his legal defense fund. A crowd of candidates are seeking to replace him \u2014 almost as many as the number of federal prosecutors on his trail.\n\nTodd has declared and is running hard. Left-leaning groups are out to get him, in part because he\u2019s seen as Bowser\u2019s protege. They have settled on political novice Janeese Lewis George as their standard-bearer. She has got a lot of catching up to do.\n\nGray has indicated that he\u2019s seeking reelection. Trayon White is seeking reelection. A couple of would-be challengers are sniffing around. But he\u2019s wired in to the community and is good at retail politics.\n\nRobert White hasn\u2019t yet responded to my inquiry. Grosso\u2019s staff told me he is \u201cstill weighing his options.\u201d C\u2019mon, it\u2019s either a council job or what?\n\nAgain: Do today\u2019s D.C. voters much care about these council races or the council itself? If they do, they might want to start telling these incumbent candidates what they expect from them.\n\nRead more from Colbert King\u2019s archive.", "description": "City government scandals abound, and lawmakers are focused on the wrong things.", "authors": ["Colbert I.
