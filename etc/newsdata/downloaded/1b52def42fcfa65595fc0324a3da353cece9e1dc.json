REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nSamsung, the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker, is powering ahead with the launch of 5G phones and $2,000 foldable handsets as it heats up competition with rivals U.S. Apple and China\u2019s Huawei [HWT.UL] following a battery explosion scandal in 2017 that hurt sales.\n\nAnalysts said the strategy may be paying off as the company on Tuesday flagged a smaller-than-expected fall in third quarter operating profit, saying at the same time that sales of the Note 10 both at home and in Europe had been strong since the Aug. 23 launch.\n\nThere are also early signs that the global memory chip business, a key driver of Samsung\u2019s profit, will stabilize next year after prices were eroded by a weak global economy and slower spending by key data center customers.\n\n\u201cWith its foldable smartphone that no other competitors have yet launched, Samsung will likely lead the high-end smartphone market as it would mass produce foldable smartphones next year,\u201d said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.\n\n\u201cAlso, a growing number of data center customers are ordering more memory chips ... possibly slowing down the drop in prices,\u201d Song added.\n\nSamsung said it has sold more than one million of the 5G Note 10 handsets in South Korea, making it the company\u2019s fastest selling flagship model at home, and sales in Europe were also strong.\n\nAnalysts credit Samsung with receiving a boost from U.S. sanctions on Huawei that effectively bar U.S. firms from supplying the Chinese competitor.\n\nHuawei\u2019s new high-end Mate 30 smartphones are being shipped to Europe this month, but the sanctions mean the product lacks access to a licensed version of U.S. Google\u2019s Android operating system, as well as mobile services that include its Play Store and popular apps like Gmail, Youtube or Maps.\n\nJene Park, a senior analyst at market tracker Counterpoint Research, said Samsung was also moving in on Huawei at the lower end of the market in Europe and Latin America.\n\nSales of Huawei\u2019s Honor smartphones, which are mainly in the $180-$249 price band and accounted for a large portion of sales outside of China, had dropped significantly since March, allowing Samsung to boost sales volumes of its new A series, according to Counterpoint.\n\nCHIP RECOVERY?\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s woes also present problems for Samsung as the as the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor firm by revenue, with the Chinese firm a major buyer of its memory chips.\n\nSome analysts are more cautious about the outlook for the global memory chip business, which remains clouded by U.S.-Sino trade conflict and provides two thirds of Samsung\u2019s profit.\n\nSamsung\u2019s profit has been slumping every quarter since the year-end holiday quarter last year and is expected to fall again in the current quarter year-on-year.\n\nIn a limited trading update ahead of full earnings later this month, Samsung on Tuesday said operating profit for the July to September quarter would likely tumble 56% to 7.7 trillion won ($6.44 billion), slightly better than the 7.1 trillion won forecast by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. It also flagged a revenue fall of 5.3% to 62 trillion won.\n\n\u201cThe strong smartphone sales has limited ability to fix all Samsung\u2019s issues,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. \u201cData center customers, a major driver for memory chip business, are pursuing conservative investment for the time being, not particularly uplifting news for Samsung.\u201d\n\nShares in Samsung were up about 1.5%, just slightly ahead of an 0.8% rise in the wider market in afternoon trade.", "description": "Strong sales of Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 10 smartphone series are limiting forecast profit falls at the South Korean tech giant, raising hopes it is getting back on a growth track after years of moribund sales.", "authors": ["Heekyong Yang", "Ju-Min Park", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438280475&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961SH-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
