Liver donors lined up to help.", "language": "en", "text": "Three hours before media commentator Wajahat Ali was set to give a TED Talk about why more people should have children, he got the diagnosis: The bumps on his 2-year-old daughter\u2019s liver were signs of Stage 4 cancer.\n\nAli, who contributes to the New York Times and CNN, was in Canada when his wife, Sarah, called in April to tell him Nusayba was in the hospital. Ali asked whether he should return home, and Sarah told him to stay and give his talk for their daughter.\n\nSo instead of getting on a plane back to D.C., Ali gave a crowd in Vancouver his planned speech about why more people should have children. Then he shared Nusayba\u2019s diagnosis, and the audience gasped. Despite everything, Ali told them, he and his wife thought having kids was \u201cthe best thing that we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets he shared Wednesday, Ali wrote that Nusayba, now 3, had successfully undergone a liver transplant and was recovering. She had awakened after the surgery, said a few words to her parents and gone back to sleep, Ali wrote. She will recover in the hospital for a week or two.\n\n[A 7-year-old\u2019s touchdown went viral as he fought cancer. Six years later, he\u2019s playing for real.]\n\nOne of the first questions the anonymous liver donor asked after waking up from surgery was when they could donate blood again, Ali wrote.\n\n\u201cI told the donor\u2019s family my life belongs to them and begged them to tell me how I can repay them,\u201d Ali wrote. \u201cThey just said to pray for the donor, their family member, and they wanted Nusayba to live a long, healthy life. There\u2019s still much goodness in the world. Don\u2019t lose hope, ever.\u201d\n\nThere had been a setback before the transplant: The surgery was scheduled with a different donor, but the doctor discovered a last-minute complication. The procedure was too high-risk, and the family had to scramble to find a new donor.\n\n[A cancer survivor\u2019s historic swim: Four non-stop English Channel crossings]\n\nIt was, Ali told CNN, a \u201cgut punch.\u201d Nusayba, who loves boba tea, Dippin\u2019 Dots and going down playground slides, already had lost her hair and undergone eight rounds of chemotherapy. If the transplant had to be rescheduled, Ali told CNN, she would have to suffer through yet another round.\n\nMore than 500 people, most of whom were strangers, eventually applied to be liver donors for Nusayba. Doctors found a match and went forward with the transplant.\n\nBefore her surgery, Ali\u2019s family showed Nusayba a pink stuffed bunny with bandages and IV lines as an example of what she would look like after the transplant. But, Ali tweeted, the real Nusayba is much cuter.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s alive & recovering,\u201d Ali wrote. \u201cMy life is complete.\u201d\n\nOur son Ibrahim has been the sweetest, most thoughtful older brother. Nusayba has a second chance at life thanks to this donor. This bunny was used to show her what she\u2019d look like after the transplant but she\u2019s much cuter. She\u2019s alive & recovering. My life is complete.\n\n\n\n11/11 pic.twitter.com/MOiapeNUjZ \u2014 Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) September 25, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nA 4-year-old lost her favorite stuffed cat.
