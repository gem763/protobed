They were so good that geographies and ground conditions were irrelevant. With the possible exception of Pakistan under the leadership of Imran Khan, no other cricket team really challenged them. Therefore, for a legendary West Indian batsman of the 1990s, Brian Lara, to compare the current Indian pace bowling attack with the 1980s West Indians will make fans sit up and take notice.\n\nAny comparison across generations must be tempered by the fact that circumstances are never the same. Proliferation of technological advances in every walk of life includes cricket. To illustrate, batsmen today use protective gear which have benefited from remarkable advances in materials technology over the last three decades. Therefore, contemporary fast bowlers can never be as intimidating as those of earlier generations. On the other hand, bowlers too benefit from advances in medical science which makes them return from injuries faster.\n\nRegardless of these factors, what can be said with a fair degree of confidence is that India today has a fast bowling attack that is the best ever in its history. It\u2019s also good enough to merit comparison with some of the better attacks in world cricket over the last 75 years.\n\nGoing back to the West Indies of the 1980s, the Indian bowling attack is probably better in one respect. It can offer a variety which the West Indies could never match. India hasn\u2019t lost its traditional strength: spinners. The current Indian bowling attack is more balanced than that of West Indies. However, imbalance never stood in the way of West Indies steamrolling opponents in its heyday.", "description": "For cricket fans, one of the standout phases of world cricket after World War II is the domination of West Indian fast bowlers in the 1980s.
