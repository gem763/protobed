The HDP denies such links.\n\nWhile most of Turkey's opposition parties have backed the operation, the HDP has called for it to stop, describing it as an \"invasion attempt\". HDP says the operation was an attempt by the government to drum up support amid declining public backing.\n\nThe HDP said 151 of its members, including district officials, had been detained over the past week since Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies launched the assault.\n\nLast week, Turkish police launched criminal investigations into the HDP's co-chairs over their criticism of the military operation and started probes into more than 500 social accounts over \"terrorist propaganda\" criticising the offensive.\n\nAuthorities launched similar investigations after each of Turkey's two previous cross-border operations into Syria. More than 300 people were detained for social media posts criticising Turkey's offensive into northern Syria in January 2018.
