They are going to respond,\" he said.", "description": "Both sides should negotiate an agreement over subsidies given to both Boeing and Airbus, says WTO's Azevedo.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105352262-1532532069484gettyimages-945142020.jpeg?v=1532563614", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
