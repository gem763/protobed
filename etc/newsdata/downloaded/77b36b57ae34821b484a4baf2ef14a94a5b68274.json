They usually look the same, talk the same and wear the same things. But what\u2019s different about the social media-centric world we\u2019re living in now is that VSCO girls were named, standardised and meme\u2019d so fast that they were trendy one moment and a parody of themselves the next.\n\nWhere did the term \u201cVSCO girl\u201d come from?\n\nYou may already know that VSCO (pronounced \u201cvisco\u201d) is actually a photo editing and sharing app. A place where you try to make your photos look really good \u2014 but in an effortless way, of course. Much like teenage girls themselves. So a \u201cVSCO girl\u201d was a playful name for someone who tried too hard to make her photo feed look cool or to become internet-famous.\n\nThe term began describing a certain type of girl with a specific trendy look when it made its way to TikTok, the short-form social media video app that is hugely popular among teens. There are now millions of videos \u2014 largely parodies \u2014 with the hashtags #VSCO or #VSCOgirls that have been viewed billions of times.\n\nThe VSCO vibe\n\nVSCO girls are primarily middle or upper-class white girls who have a laid back, beachy vibe with an environmentalist slant. Their wardrobe, as described by the New York Times, is very brand-specific (hence being middle or upper class in order to pull it off):\n\nWhich is to say, the VSCO-girl lifestyle is less about the app itself than accouterments like Crocs (decorated with charms); handmade Pura Vida bracelets; the aforementioned Hydro Flasks (covered in stickers); Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven K\u00e5nken backpacks; Burt\u2019s Bees and Carmex lip balms; Vans sneakers; and Mario Badescu facial spray. Often the companies are tagged in Instagram posts, blurring the line between appreciation and endorsement.\n\nThey use metal straws, they famously want to \u201csave the turtles,\u201d and they have two predominate sayings:\n\n1. \u201cSksksksksk,\u201d which is meant to convey \u201csurprise, happiness and other intense emotions.\u201d It originated as a sort of \u201ckeysmash\u201d to express those big emotions or reactions (like a new version of \u201comg\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t even\u201d) and was predominantly used in black and LGBTQ communities.\n\n2. \u201cAnd I oop,\u201d which is meant to \u201cexpress shock, surprise or embarrassment.\u201d That one originally comes from a video from drag queen Jasmine Masters. It\u2019s worth a watch:\n\nDoes your daughter want to be a VSCO girl?\n\nIf you\u2019ve suddenly noticed your daughter saying these phrases or wearing scrunchies halfway up to her elbow, she may be trying to become a VSCO girl. Despite all the internet mocking, in many schools, the \u201ccool girls\u201d are still embracing this trend, and their peers may want to emulate them \u2014 and their seemingly flawless, carefree VSCO-esque images on Instagram or other social media sites.\n\nBut if you\u2019re daughter\u2019s trying to jump on the VSCO bandwagon, it\u2019s ok. As oddly specific as the choice of clothing, phrases and principles may be, it\u2019s all pretty positive. VSCO girls give off an empowering air of, \u201cIDGAF what you think of me.\u201d And girls could always use a little more of that, even if posting so many images online or spending 15 minutes trying to get that messy bun just right probably indicates they do care what others think of them, at least a little.\n\nPlus, stainless steel straws are a good thing, and as long as they\u2019re saving the turtles, maybe they could look into saving the bees, too. These VSCO girls might one day be the heroes who tackle climate change for us. As far as trends go, we could do worse. Maybe make them save up their own allowance for that Hydro Flask, though.\n\nWhy your son might also wear scrunchies\n\nIf your son has started wearing scrunchies, he might be trying to be a VSCO girl, too... or, more likely, it was given to him by a crush. At least, that\u2019s the secret one North Carolina mum discovered after she asked her son why she kept finding scrunchies around the house.\n\nSo if you seem to be constantly replenishing your daughter\u2019s scrunchie stash, she may be losing them around town or she may be giving them away as tokens of her affection. It\u2019s this generation\u2019s version of the letterman jacket or the notes we passed in class that said, \u201cDo you like me? Check yes, no or maybe.\u201d\n\nAre VSCO girls here to stay?\n\nNo trend stays forever, but this one in particular could have a short shelf life because it became a joke almost as soon as it was born. Some girls even told Slate that they\u2019re purposely changing how they talk and dress so they\u2019re not mistaken for a VSCO girl:\n\nEmely said she now abstains from wearing scrunchies to school. She also used to like saying \u201csksksksk\u201d and \u201cAnd I oop.\u201d Not anymore. \u201cEven when random girls at school say it, everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s a VSCO girl,\u2019 so I couldn\u2019t say it,\u201d she said. Cassandra, meanwhile, has given up on a wardrobe staple: \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing oversized shirts since seventh grade, but I stopped recently, because of the VSCO girls. I don\u2019t want to be associated with them,\u201d she said.\n\nBut for now, they\u2019re still out there, sksksksking their hearts out.", "description": "If you\u2019ve noticed that your tween or teen girl has been regularly wearing a uniform of oversized T-shirts, Birkenstock sandals, shell necklaces and messy buns held in place with scrunchies, she may be a VSCO girl \u2014 especially if she\u2019s been begging for you to splurge on a $50 Hydro Flask....", "authors": ["Alan Henry", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/05/Selfie-explained.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
