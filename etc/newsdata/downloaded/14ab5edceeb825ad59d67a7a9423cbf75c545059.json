(AP) - A new-look Wisconsin team will be set for Big Ten action when the 13th-ranked Badgers host No. 11 Michigan on Saturday.\n\nSpecifically, junior quarterback Jack Coan and wide receiver Quintez Cephus add a fresh dimension to Wisconsin\u2019s arsenal compared to last season, when the Wolverines trounced the Badgers, 38-13, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nCoan and Cephus didn\u2019t play in the 2018 matchup and aim to make impacts this time around for the Badgers (2-0), who like the Wolverines (2-0), are fresh off a bye week.\n\n\u201cThey have a great defense,\u201d Coan said of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s full of athletes, especially the defensive backs. (Their) linebackers can cut really well and obviously the D-line gets a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\nCoan ranks ninth nationally with a pass efficiency rating of 184.5, which was boosted by a career-best effort in Wisconsin\u2019s 61-0 win over Central Michigan on Sept. 7. He finished 26-for-33 for 363 yards and three touchdowns - all career highs - against the Chippewas for a 201.2 pass efficiency rating.\n\nCephus was Coan\u2019s main target through the air during the Central Michigan romp, as Cephus earned career highs of six receptions for 130 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe university expelled Cephus last year on two counts of sexual assault and announced his reinstatement on Aug. 19, after he was found not guilty of the charges. Cephus returned to practice on Aug. 21, and was ruled academically eligible to play by the NCAA two days later.\n\nThe pass game was a non-factor last year at Michigan, as former Badgers quarterback Alex Hornibrook was 7 of 20 for 100 yards and one touchdown.\n\nBut a combination of play-making on the ground and in the air likely will be the best strategy against Michigan.\n\n\u201cI think the offense as a whole - for me, the offensive line, the receivers - we\u2019re all planning on playing better,\u201d Coan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nWisconsin tailback Jonathan Taylor doesn\u2019t consider the game between ranked opponents as one in which he\u2019ll enhance his resume. Besides posting 35 carries for 243 yards and five touchdowns in two victories, the All-American also has caught five passes for 65 yards and three additional scores.\n\nTaylor acknowledges the Badgers\u2019 offense will be better served in the long run if there\u2019s balance. He leads the nation with eight touchdowns and averages 151 yards from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cThis is a game where a running back like me can do whatever I can to help the team win,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those teams that everyone is going to have to do their job and execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always great when you have a balance to an offense, just make a defense play honest and play the entire field.\u201d\n\nMichigan has not won in Madison in its last four tries, with its most recent win coming in 2001.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new-look Wisconsin team will be set for Big Ten action when the 13th-ranked Badgers host No. 11 Michigan on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tamira Madsen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/central_michigan_wisconsin_football_28944_c0-127-2072-1335_s1770x1032.jpg?253d4facf52a5b90e612ef4ec139d475a3a819c1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
