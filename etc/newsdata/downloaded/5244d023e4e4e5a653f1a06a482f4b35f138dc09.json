Under late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and then Maduro, extreme government property theft (\u201cnationalization\u201d) and micromanagement of agriculture dramatically reduced food production. Economic mismanagement has made the bol\u00edvar one of the world\u2019s most useless currencies and a combination of nationalizations and oil giveaways to fellow leftist countries has destroyed the oil industry, the country\u2019s most important.\n\nOn a broadcast on Venezuelan state television Monday, Maduro suggested installing chicken coops in classrooms as a way to feed starving children, a rare recognition of a humanitarian crisis that Maduro has repeatedly insisted does not exist.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll leave the school orchards to you kids,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cEvery school has a space, some have big spaces. Whoever has a big space should also put animals there, some 200 hens, 300 hens.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys can make your own [chicken] coops and every school has 300 hens,\u201d Maduro suggested, noting that he has chicken coops in his home and often uses them to produce food.\n\nMaduro said it was necessary for people to learn how to develop their own resources.\n\n\u201cHuman beings developed, evolved, because they learned to use their hands, and with their hands, working, developed the brain,\u201d Maduro suggested.\n\nMaduro said he would aim to infuse classrooms with a million chickens total.\n\nMaduro announced the plan spontaneously and his regime has not at press time indicated when, if ever, it would implement its chicken coop plan or where Caracas would get 1 million chickens to populate the nation\u2019s classrooms.\n\nIn the same broadcast, Maduro also promised \u201csmart classrooms\u201d with the latest technological developments for children. Maduro\u2019s education ministry will allegedly implement tablets in every classroom with \u201cautonomous education\u201d materials from first through sixth grade. Maduro did not explain how Venezuela \u2013 a country that does not have the money to produce or import the amount of food necessary to feed its population, will buy millions of schoolchildren the latest model tablets containing educational materials Caracas will presumably have to pay an education company for.\n\nMaduro first suggested Venezuelans find and keep chickens in urban communities during a 2016 broadcast, deep into the Venezuelan hunger crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to develop a new culture of production,\u201d Maduro suggested. \u201cCilia and I have 50 egg-laying chickens, and all the yolks we eat, we produce.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone can have their productive orchard and you can produce lemon, tomato, pepper, have your egg-laying eggs,\u201d he claimed.\n\nMuch of Caracas is extremely densely populated and covered in heaps of trash, which the city\u2019s poorest dig through for any edible material. Maduro did not at the time address the lack of useable land in the hands of individuals not connected to the government in Caracas and other cities nationwide.\n\nVenezuela was Latin America\u2019s wealthiest country before Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, taking the lead from Cuba after its communist revolution in 1959 led to similar food and good shortages and widespread political repression. According to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 21.5 percent of Venezuelans in 2018 went hungry in 2018, up from less than five percent before Ch\u00e1vez. A quality of life survey taken last year found that 80 percent of Venezuelan homes face food insecurity and general poverty afflicts over half of homes in the country.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of this will be felt in the short, medium, and long term. In another 20 years, we will still be seeing the consequences of this if there is not an immediate intervention,\u201d Marianella Herrera, a medical researcher at Central Venezuelan University, told the Argentine outlet Infobae in August, noting that the number of chronic diseases that future generations will suffer will increase significantly due to decades of malnutrition.\n\nMaduro\u2019s loyalists have for years denied any food crisis in the country and rejected humanitarian aid. His current vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, told viewers on state television in February not to eat any food aid that came from the United States because America was deliberately using \u201ccarcinogenic\u201d food to kill Latin Americans. Maduro himself has joked about widespread starvation \u2013 which Venezuelans wryly refer to as the \u201cMaduro diet\u201d \u2013 saying in 2016, \u201cMaduro\u2019s diet gets you hard \u2013 no need for Viagra!\u201d\n\nThe FAO gave Nicol\u00e1s Maduro an award for reducing his country\u2019s hunger in 2014 despite skyrocketing levels of food insecure people in the country a year into his tenure.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced a plan to install orchards and chicken coops in every classroom.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/chicken-coop-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
