Whether you're scorned, scathed and in the midst of plotting or just peacefully seeking a reset, these artists know the feeling.\n\nAs always, check out the Heat Check playlist in its entirety on Spotify.\n\nSwsh, \"How You Feel\"\n\nIt's all fun and games until nerves are struck and perceptions get twisted. Don't try to flip the script on Swsh. The L.A. artist lays it out plainly: \"You like that I got heart until you gotta empathize.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nMahalia, \"What You Did (feat. Ella Mai)\"\n\nElla Mai and Mahalia, two rising Brits known for their '90s-leaning girlhood odes, make sinister work this Rose Royce-sampling track. It almost strikes a \"Bust Your Windows\"-level of intensity, but is still coy enough to deny any culpability.\n\nYouTube\n\nSiaira Shawn, \"Wait For It\"\n\nSiaira Shawn prioritizes those fleeting moments in between relationship milestones where every experience is still new.\n\nYouTube\n\nGrace Carter, \"Wicked Game\"\n\nCarter's cover of Chris Isaak's 1989 wallow-fest teems with new life from a new perspective.\n\nYouTube\n\nWale, \"On Chill (feat. Jeremih)\"\n\nWale and Jeremih rarely miss when it comes to love songs. With \"On Chill\" specifically, their objective is to put a fight on pause and just enjoy the company of their partners. A modest plea, no?\n\nYouTube\n\nThe Pendletons, \"Keep It Working (feat. Gizelle Smith)\"\n\nThis jazzy, dancing-in-your-living-room romp can carry you through all the motions of necessary recharge. The soft vocals will pacify, the agile keys and percussion will rejuvenate.", "description": "With new music from Wale, Swsh, Mahalia and more, these songs of catharsis are just what you need to disconnect.", "authors": ["Sidney Madden"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/07/the-pendletons-photo-1_wide-d47cdfba4087c552744c0b8c3a8594a7d13c7d15.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
