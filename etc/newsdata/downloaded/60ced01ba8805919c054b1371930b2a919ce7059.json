Those were renewed again until Nov. 19, with Saturday marking the 1-month deadline for companies to cut off business with the firm.\n\nThe Trump administration has urged companies to stop doing business with the telecom giant due to concerns that it may pose a threat to U.S. national security, while the exact timing of the ban has also been complicated by ongoing U.S. trade negotiations with China.\n\nSen.

Huawei will feel pressure in the short term. However, as foreign companies diversify their supply chain to not rely on the U.S., this will have a larger, long-term impact on U.S. companies \u2013 and particularly affect individual workers and their families.\u201d\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossUS imposes new sanctions on Cuba over human rights, Venezuela Commerce Department to develop stats on income inequality Huawei posts double-digit gain in sales despite US sanctions MORE defended the administration's decision in August to issue a 90-day waiver extension on Huawei, noting in a Fox News interview that \"some of the rural companies are dependent on Huawei\" and saying that the extra time was necessary for U.S. companies to \u201cwean themselves off\u201d of using Huawei technology.\n\nFederal agencies are already banned from buying Huawei products, though they are allowed to issue waivers through 2021 if they can justify why more time is needed to implement the ban on Huawei.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Trump stoked confusion about the Huawei ban when announcing in June at the Group of 20 summit that \u201cU.S. companies can sell their equipment to Huawei.\u201d\n\nWhile he noted that this would only be in the case of \u201cequipment where there is no great security concern,\u201d his comments prompted a wave of pushback from Capitol Hill, where most lawmakers in both parties consider Huawei a threat to national security.\n\nLawmakers have continued to voice concerns that the Trump administration could potentially offer Huawei \u2013 one of the largest Chinese companies in the world \u2013 as a concession to Beijing amid broader trade talks between the U.S. and China.\n\nSen.
