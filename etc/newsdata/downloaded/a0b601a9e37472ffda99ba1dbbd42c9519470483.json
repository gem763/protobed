I'm not asking for a pass,\" he said. \"What I'm asking for is a fair trial.\n\n\"And this is the bottom line that any American should require,\" he said. \"We don't want people thrown in prison without the jury being able to decide that what they did was right or wrong.\n\n\"The government wants to have a different kind of trial,\" he said. \"They want to use special procedures, they want to be able to close the courtroom, they want the public not to be able to go, know what's going on.\n\n\"They do not want the jury to be able to consider the motivations -- why I did what I did,\" he said. \"Was it better for the United States? Did it benefit us or did it cause harm? They don't want the jury to consider that at all.\n\n\"They want the jury strictly to consider whether these actions were lawful or unlawful, not whether they were right or wrong,\" Snowden said. \"And I'm sorry, but that defeats the purpose of a jury trial.\"", "description": "Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor living in Russia after leaking information about the US government's mass surveillance program, has said he would like to return home if he can get a fair trial.
