She added that she had to fight with her insurance company 'to get the best of the best \u2026 for Greyson.'\n\nThe Jersey Shore star said, 'He used to have [ABA therapy for] two-to-three hours, three times a week, and he would also do speech and OT [occupational therapy] at a local hospital.'\n\nGood job! She explained that since working with an ABA she has had to fight with her insurance company to get more help for her son and now the little one sees an ABA for 30 hours a week\n\n'But over time, and recently, we got approved for 30 hours a week for ABA, which is huge 'cause 30 hours of ABA has been a game-changer,' she explained.\n\n'Not only that, but Greyson goes to preschool three hours a day, five days a week and his ABA therapist Steph goes there for two hours a day with him to really help him transition into the everyday world with people and little kids his own age.'\n\n'These guys changed my life and changed Greyson's. I am a huge believer in ABA therapy.'\n\nImproving: In the video, her son is seen pointing out animals, following commands, and even reciting the alphabet\n\nIn the video, her son is seen pointing out animals, following commands, and even reciting the alphabet.\n\n'He has two types of presents when he does something well,' Farley explained about the reward system her son is on. 'Obviously, Greyson loves YouTube, like a majority of kids out there, so he gets a couple seconds of YouTube.'\n\n'And if he goes potty, he requests \u2014 a lot of times \u2014 a circle, which is a coin and he's allowed a piece of gum out of his gumball machine,' she continued.\n\nReward system: She explained that Greyson is on the reward system and gets 'presents' for certain things such as going potty or completing certain tasks\n\nThat's when she said in the video that all of this momentum her son has gained was just 'within a year.'\n\n'Going from not acknowledging your name or being able to sit for literally 30 seconds to doing \u2014 I can't even explain it,' JWoww said. 'I can't wait to show you [his progress] by Christmas. He should have even more of an update 'cause of how fast he's been shooting from the hip. I feel like our next goal will be fully potty trained, [counting from] one through 20 on his own, maybe more.'\n\nWhile Greyson may be 'taking over the world one day at a time,' he also has a sister named Meilani, aged five, that Jennifer shares with her ex husband Roger Mathews.\n\nIn 2018, she opened up during an interview with the Today Show and revealed that when Greyson 'wasn't hitting his marks' Roger didn't seem concerned about his son's progress and felt as though the toddler would be fine.\n\n'In that aspect, I felt very alone because I was the only parent. I thought, 'Am I bad wanting to get him help because Roger's not concerned, so should I not be concerned?'
