Government policies have created thousands of new rough sleepers so perhaps we could use at least part of the building to provide some temporary shelter for them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t mind serving as consultants to the project.\n\nThere\u2019d be a certain poetic justice in people sleeping on the benches more normally sat upon by the government ministers who did so much to create their situation. I know they don\u2019t look like they\u2019d make especially good beds, but Jacob Rees-Mogg managed to make them look pretty darned comfy when he stretched his lanky frame across them rather than paying attention to what was a rather important debate.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

They could help serve up food cooked up in the kitchens. They\u2019d probably find London\u2019s homeless residents are a tad more polite than the people they usually look after. And less inclined towards bullying too.\n\nSome of the more progressive-minded MPs have talked about convening some sort of \u201cpeople\u2019s parliament\u201d during the shut down. Putting them in contact with people living at the sharp end of their decisions while they do this surely wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world.\n\nNeed another suggestion? Well, one of the more depressing developments in the capital over recent years has been the drip feed of live music venues closing.\n\nMostly this has killed smaller ones but there was once some fool in the London Mayor\u2019s office by the name of Boris Johnson who actively supported the trashing of one of the bigger ones \u2013 the Earl\u2019s Court exhibition centre.\n\nNow he\u2019s stripped Westminster of its intended purpose, perhaps it could serve as a temporary replacement? Constitutional vandalism providing some recompense for the real vandalism of his political and property developer pals. The singing of opposition MPs to accompany the shutdown proved the acoustics are pretty damn good.\n\nThe costs could be met via the Treasury coffers that suddenly seem to be bulging with an election in the offing. Johnson could get his public relations man (sorry, chancellor), Sajid Javid, to draft a press release announcing an addendum to the spending review.\n\nGiven the mess he\u2019s making of the country, a free music festival is the very least the pair of them could do for us. Food might be in short supply courtesy of the no-deal Brexit they fancy for us, not to mention medicines, but at least those of us with long-term conditions like the type 1 diabetes I have will be able to go out to a rocking sound track.\n\nSome of us, myself included, will need some painkillers, with drugs like Gabapentin likely to be hard to come by. The ports might soon resemble a massive traffic jam, but despite the millions of pounds spent on trying to stamp it out, weed is rarely in short supply. It might do in a pinch.\n\nI know, I know, it\u2019s illegal. But one of those technicalities everyone\u2019s talking about at the moment might help us here. It\u2019s only possession of it that\u2019s against the law. So \u201cthe Saj\u201d and \u201cBoZo\u201d could just arrange to have a big bong put on a table in the middle of the debating chamber from which we can take a pain-killing toot as required.\n\nWhat? There\u2019s a smoking ban. That too is against the law and you can\u2019t get around it on a technicality? Well if our own prime minister says it\u2019s ok to break the law of the land, why shouldn\u2019t we?\n\nAlternatively, you could something really radical, something unthinkable.\n\nYou could use the buildings to let parliament do its actual job.", "description": "In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s a large publicly owned meeting place in a desirable part of London currently not being used for anything.\u00a0 It is of course, the Palace of Westminster, which used to house Britain\u2019s legislature until it was unceremoniously and unconstitutionally shut down by our unelected prime minister.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/21/parliament-hp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
