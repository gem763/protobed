We know that federal adversaries are working to undermine that trust today.\u201d\n\nThe bill package, dubbed the Shield Act, would require every political campaign, party and PAC to report any offers of assistance \u2014 including campaign information \u2014 from foreign governments to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThere are also provisions that ramp up restrictions for digital advertisements, holding online ads to the same strict standards as other mediums such as TV and radio. It also bans foreign nationals from weighing in on campaign contributions and digital advertising.\n\nDemocrats tied the bill\u2019s solutions to findings that Russian agents attempted to offer dirt on Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign and launched a systematic disinformation campaign to interfere with the 2016 election.\n\nRepublicans argued that election security should be an area of strong bipartisanship, but Democrats included too many \u201cpoison pills\u201d in their proposal. In particular, they rejected allowing the attorney general to \u201cinsert himself or herself\u201d into races at any level if there\u2019s suspicion of a disinformation campaign.\n\nThey also said that the regulations for digital advertisements wouldn\u2019t have done anything to prevent the Russian disinformation campaign that systematically sought to divide Americans on social media.\n\n\u201cThis bill isn\u2019t a serious attempt to address the type of interference we saw in 2016,\u201d said Rep. Rodney Davis, ranking member of the Administration Committee. \u201cWhy would we overreach and threaten American\u2019s free speech with this bill when it doesn\u2019t even address what Russia did? We need serious election security legislation that will protect Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of the intelligence committee, special counsel Robert Mueller, and Congressional committees have warned that Russians are already trying to do the same in 2020.\n\nDemocrats touted the fact that 36 government reform groups, including the Center for Digital Democracy and CREW, endorsed their bill.\n\nHowever, it lacks the seal of approval from the American Civil Liberties Union, which told lawmakers it was concerned that the bill\u2019s broad strokes regarding digital advertisements and regulations on foreign nationals would actually do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Congress for attempting to limit the interference of foreign adversaries in our elections. However, Congress would not do so at the expense of the First Amendment,\u201d Ronald Newman, ACLU national political director, and Kate Ruane, ACLU senior legislative counsel, wrote in a letter to Ms. Lofgren.\n\nLike Democrats\u2019 first attempt at election reform, it\u2019s unlikely this bill will make any headway in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cited the ACLU\u2019s lack of support when he slammed the bill as a power grab from Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a textbook example of policy designed to reduce the amount of free speech in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
