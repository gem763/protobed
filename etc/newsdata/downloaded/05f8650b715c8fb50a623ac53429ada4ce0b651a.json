Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and the Trump administration are among the Republicans who have criticized the law. Why then is the White House strengthening its provisions internationally?\n\nA provision in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the trade bill that the Trump administration wants to replace NAFTA, would entrench a stronger version of those protections in international law.\n\nThe law allows tech companies to censor any content they consider \u201cobjectionable\u201d or \u201charmful.\u201d This is similar to Section 230, but broader, because unlike Section 230, USMCA offers no definition of what \u201cobjectionable\u201d content might be, giving tech platforms broad leeway to interpret the law as they see fit.\n\nNow a bipartisan group of lawmakers is criticizing the Trump administration for failing to consult them on the inclusion of the provision in USMCA.\n\nAcccording to The Hill, both the Democrat Chairman of the House Energy Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and the Republican ranking member, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) are pushing the administration to reconsider its position on USMCA\u2019s big tech protections.\n\nRep. Pallone said:\n\nRanking Member Walden and I wrote to the Ambassador in August raising concerns about why the USTR has included this language in trade deals as we debate them across the nation, and I was hoping to hear his perspective on why he believes that is appropriate,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cIncluding provisions in trade agreements that are controversial to both Republicans and Democrats is not the way to get support from Congress. Hopefully, Ambassador Lighthizer will be more responsive to bipartisan requests in the future.\n\nAnd Rep. Walden said:\n\nThe USTR does not appear to be reflecting the scrutiny the Administration itself is applying to how CDA 230 is being utilized in American society, making it even more alarming for the USTR to be exporting such policies without the involvement of this committee.\n\nRep. Walden called on the administration to \u201cconsult with our committee in advance of negotiating\u201d on international legal protections for big tech in USMCA.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
