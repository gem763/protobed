Abrams' production company Bad Robot", "language": "en", "text": "Ahead of HBO Max's launch in April 2020, WarnerMedia signed a five-year output deal with Star Wars director J.J. Abrams' production company Bad Robot, per The Verge. The deal, worth $250 million, is set to run through 2024. Bad Robot will create streaming-exclusive original TV series, films, and even video games for WarnerMedia across its holdings. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe deal indicates that WarnerMedia is willing to prioritize securing major talent over full content rights ownership and exclusivity to compete, given the caveats the deal came with:\n\nContent ownership. It's rumored that Abrams may retain up to 50% ownership of the projects Bad Robot creates for WarnerMedia.\n\nOverlap. Bad Robot's content will be exclusive to WarnerMedia and its properties, but Abrams will see out preexisting production deals with Paramount and Disney, where he's producing the next film installation of Star Wars.\n\nExclusivity. Further, it's unclear whether the deal will prevent Abrams from pursuing future deals with rival studios.\n\nThat WarnerMedia was willing to pay a premium for a compromise deal highlights the heightened competition and stakes the streaming wars have created for exclusive rights to content and talent. But WarnerMedia might also have the shorter stick in these decisions: Bigger players like Disney or Netflix would likely balk at signing away 50% ownership when they already have such huge existing libraries and sway with their established brands.\n\nTwo new and unrelated content announcements also came to light in recent days, and shed light on WarnerMedia's potential competitiveness in the crowding SVOD field:\n\nThe company is also set to continue capitalizing on the \"Game of Thrones\" hype through multiple prequel series \u2014 that could help HBO Max compete against bigger players. The company is reportedly working on multiple GoT prequels, with the most recent on the verge of greenlight. Another, \"Bloodmoon,\" will debut in 2020. GoT pulled in strong ratings and likely drew subs to HBO's streaming offerings: The show pulled an average of 17.3 million same-day viewers for the final season, with the final episode hitting 19.3 million viewers, compared to its first season which averaged just 9.1 million viewers. WarnerMedia will benefit immensely from having a popular franchise world to build on, especially as it competes with Disney.\n\nWarnerMedia is developing the company's first-ever unscripted originals for HBO Max, which will make the service more robust. The streaming service will include the company's first attempt ever at unscripted shows with a \"voguing\" series called \"Legendary,\" and an international interior design competition show \"The Greatest Space.\" Diversifying its genre base could help the service to compete more effectively with services like Netflix: In its bid to replace TV, Netflix has expanded its originals production beyond prestige scripted dramas like \"House of Cards\" and likewise invested in unscripted, animation, true-crime documentary, and \"blockbuster\" films.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
