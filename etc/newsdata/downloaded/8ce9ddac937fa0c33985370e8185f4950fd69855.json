We thought it could be a kind of saving grace,\u201d said Deborde, 58.\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t. By the end of this year, she and Matt will lose their jobs at the plant after almost two decades. They aren\u2019t sure what they will do next.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to try to boost domestic production. It appeared to work, briefly, sending company stock prices higher and leading to more hiring and production.\n\nBut that boost now appears short-lived. The industry faces strong head winds threatening to undermine one of the president\u2019s central economic promises ahead of his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nSteel prices \u2014 which soared as the tariffs were introduced \u2014 have since fallen below where they were at the outset of the trade war, dropping by more than 40 percent since last summer, according to one key metric.\n\nThe stocks of the biggest steel companies \u2014 which also rose dramatically when the tariffs first came on \u2014 have similarly tumbled over the past year, in some cases by more than 50 percent.\n\nAD\n\nThey have been hurt by tepid domestic demand for steel production amid a U.S. manufacturing recession and a global slowdown in economic growth, among other things.\n\nAD\n\nThe sudden unevenness in the sector may risk creating a political vulnerability for the president who pledged to bring manufacturing jobs back to Appalachia.\n\nTrump has said that the substantial collateral damage from his trade war with China, particularly devastating to farmers in the Midwest, is justified in part by the need to revive American steel and bring back steelworkers\u2019 jobs.\n\nThe president has continued to boast about the steel industry\u2019s recovery on the campaign stump, taking credit for its revitalization even as warning signs have emerged.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSteel was dead. Your business was dead. Okay? I don\u2019t want to be overly crude. Your business was dead. And I put a little thing called a \u201825 percent tariff\u2019 on all of the dumped steel all over the country. And now your business is thriving,\u201d Trump said at a rally in August in Monaca, Penn. \u201cOur steel mills are fired up and blazing bright. The assembly lines are roaring. . . . The steel companies are thriving again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said that more than 5,700 jobs in steel have been added since the tariffs were implemented, resulting in a 2.8 percent increase in steel employment, as well as rising wages for steelworkers. (The White House did not provide a source for this statistic.)\n\nSteel employment has risen slightly since the tariffs, federal data show, but is falling this year and remains well below levels from 2012 to 2014.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWithout those tariffs . . . the steel industry would be in fragile straits,\u201d Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, said in an interview. \u201cThe biggest factor driving the slowdown in the U.S. economy, from what should be 3 percent growth to around 2 percent, is a highly misguided Federal Reserve policy that raised interest rates too far and too fast.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMany companies like AK Steel, the Ashland plant\u2019s parent company, face severe challenges despite the administration\u2019s extensive efforts to insulate domestic steel production from foreign competition.\n\nAnalysts say the weaknesses in the global economy, exacerbated by a recession in domestic manufacturing, risk wiping out the U.S. steel industry\u2019s gains from Trump\u2019s tariffs. The administration\u2019s tariffs may have successfully helped curtail foreign competition, analysts say, but steel is being buffeted by softening demand due to these broader economic trends, including a strong U.S. dollar that hurts exports generally.\n\nAD\n\nDemand for steel in the United States grew 2.1 percent in 2018. But this year a slowdown in American construction and automobile production helped diminish demand to just 1 percent, and it is projected to grow just 0.4 percent in 2020, the World Steel Association said earlier this month.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat has been really disappointing in the last year is business and capital spending \u2014 and that has a high steel component. What you\u2019re getting is a softening of domestic demand for steel,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe tariffs are not enough to overcome these head winds.\u201d\n\nAs prices have fallen by almost 50 percent since July 2018, purchasers of steel see little incentive to place new orders that may prove less expensive the following week.\n\nThe upshot is many American steel companies now find themselves in a precarious position, analysts say, soon after they appeared poised for a major rebound.\n\nAfter the tariffs were announced, the U.S. Steel Corporation\u2019s stock price jumped from $33 to $45. The company announced it would restart an idled blast furnace in Granite City, Ill., and Trump attended an event to celebrate the reopening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut about 15 months after that heady moment, U.S. Steel is struggling. Its stock has since slid to just north of $10 per share. Since August, the company has announced it would temporarily lay off up to 200 workers at a plant in Michigan and hundreds more at a plant in Indiana, according to news reports.\n\nSimilar stories abound throughout the industry. In September, Bayou Steel in Louisiana abruptly announced it would be laying off close to 400 employees.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs happened at a high in the industrial economy, when it was firing on all cylinders, and certainly supercharged prices for several months,\u201d said Phil Gibbs, a steel industry analyst at KeyBanc. \u201cBut now there are a lot of markets that feel softer, which is bleeding into the steel industry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInitially, steelworkers in Eastern Kentucky and elsewhere had reason for optimism. The major steel companies and their unions had unsuccessfully tried getting several presidents to more aggressively crack down on the \u201cdumping\u201d of foreign steel into American markets. Trump moved quickly to impose the tariffs, justifying the unilateral action on the grounds of national security concerns.\n\nAD\n\nKendall Kilgore and a handful of other steelworkers gathered in their union hall to watch on March 1, 2018, as Trump met in the White House with Roger K. Newport, the chief executive of AK Steel, and several other leading steel executives.\n\nThe Ashland plant, owned by the American Rolling Mill Co. in the 1920s, once employed about 7,000 people and set world records for steel production, producing more than a million tons of iron during World War II. Major League Baseball teams came to play games in front of the steelworkers in the 1940s.\n\nAD\n\nThe plant expanded to encompass more than 700 acres, the bright flame from its blast furnace \u2014 nicknamed \u201cAmanda\u201d \u2014 visible far down the highway.\n\nBut the plant slowly declined over decades amid foreign competition and as newer plants were built in the United States. In 2015, AK Steel announced the Ashland plant would temporarily halt parts of its operation. About 600 people were laid off.\n\nAD\n\nTrump was elected the next year. Parts of the plant had been idled, but not shuttered, and even the steelworkers who did not vote for the president thought his pledge to enact tariffs might help them reopen. At the very least, they hoped the nearly 300 remaining workers would be able to keep their jobs.\n\n\u201cEverybody here was so excited. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I really thought they would help,\u201d said Kilgore, 48, a union leader who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cNow, I see they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe steelworkers in Ashland, including several who voted for Clinton, do not blame Trump for the closure of the plant. Most said they were grateful that the White House imposed the tariffs, which they considered long overdue, to stem the oversupply of steel in the market from foreign producers. Several believe Trump should have gone further and issued even stricter levies on steel imports.\n\nBut many also said that their experience gave them insight into the limits of tariffs for the average worker. Jack Young, a Trump supporter who has worked for 20 years as a pipe fitter at the plant, will lose his job next month. Young requires medication for several heart conditions that costs $6,000 a month and does not know how he will afford it once his health insurance is terminated.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs \u2014 we thought they\u2019d bring some life back,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut they just raised the price of steel.\u201d\n\nSteel prices soared from about $600 to more than $900 as the tariffs were first imposed, according to S&P Global Platts, but have since fallen to about $500.\n\nMany of the Ashland steelworkers also pointed out that Trump\u2019s tariffs have grown weaker as foreign manufacturers have learned how to get around them and, according to data compiled by the steelmaker Nucor, the administration has granted more than 25,000 exclusions that allow imported steel to enter without the tariff penalty.\n\nIn a statement, Newport said foreign producers continued to \u201ccheat U.S. trade laws\u201d despite the tariffs, which he blamed for the drop in steel prices. The administration agreed to lift the steel tariffs on Mexico and Canada as part of its new North American trade deal, which remains stalled in Congress.\n\nBut the slowdown continues and its impact has spread beyond just steelworkers. Greg Miller opened Alma\u2019s restaurant a few blocks from the AK Steel mill after Miller and his husband moved back to their hometown to serve \u201cwhat Appalachians think Italian food is,\u201d Miller said with a grin.\n\nBut on Oct. 12, a Wednesday, Miller was rummaging through the restaurant\u2019s remaining cutlery, pans, plates, trays and other kitchenware. With cuts at the steel mill reducing his customer base, Miller shuttered Alma\u2019s permanently that Saturday. The couple is not sure where they will end up next.", "description": "Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports provided a temporary boost, but the industry is seeing another decline.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZprM16jFT6MGNF3S0oQJsZVY-1I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WJA7EXR6QI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
