She will be skating with former NHL-er Brian McGrattan on Battle of the Blades, a CBC series that pairs figure skaters with hockey players to compete in an ice dancing competition with six other teams.\n\nI spoke with Vanessa about racial representation in a sport with so few black/African athletes, what it's like to be back in Canada, and the unique learning opportunities in training for Battle of the Blades.\n\nBack to basics\n\nAfter a competitive few years \u2014 including a series of impressive titles \u2014 Battle of the Blades is taking her back to the basics of her sport: \"Being able to articulate to someone exactly what their body needs to do and the mechanics of it is cool. I think it's good for all of us, not just the hockey skaters. Skating with Brian has improved my own skating.\"\n\nYou have to see your own beauty and that is not always easy when you don't see people around you that are similar to you but just know that the simple fact that there were people before you, there will be people after you and it can be you.\n\nA Canadian in France\n\nVanessa is Canadian-born but she competes for France. Her typical season has her living out of a suitcase, travelling every two-to-three weeks during the Grand Prix competition series and often spending Christmas away from home. The demanding schedule, combined with balancing the hopes and expectations of coaching teams, a federation and her pairs partner can be exhausting, but she also sees it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \"You get to meet many different people and experience so many different cultures, learning different languages and building connections with people, it is an amazing experience and I want to take advantage of it for as long as I can.\"\n\nRacial representation in figure skating\n\nFigure skating has been a popular sport across Europe, North America, China and Japan for decades, but it's rare to encounter figure skaters of black/African descent. I asked Vanessa about what her experience in figure skating has been like as a woman of colour.\n\n\"My dad has always said you need to be 10 times better and work 10 times harder just so that you can be given the same chances that everyone else is given. From that perspective, I have always known I was different but my parents also encouraged me throughout my career by saying I was beautiful, my skin shining on the ice was so beautiful,\" she says.\n\nShe sees her differences as her strengths and surrounds herself as positive people who support that. \"You have to see your own beauty and that is not always easy when you don't see people around you that are similar to you but just know that the simple fact that there were people before you, there will be people after you and it can be you.\"\n\nBack on home soil\n\nVanessa describes Canada as one of the best places to skate \u2014 a place where she feels accepted, welcomed and loved. She looks forward to stepping back onto home ice for Battle of the Blades, where she'll compete for the Alzheimer's Society of Canada.\n\nI ended my conversation with Vanessa by collecting some intel on a few of her favourite things:\n\nFavourite hockey team: Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nDress or 1-Piece: 1-piece\n\nGo-to training snack: Cashews\n\nFavourite athlete: Martin Forcaude\n\nEnglish or French: French\n\nFavourite country you've ever visited: Australia for the youth Olympics in 2006\n\nFavourite place you've ever lived: Canada\n\nJunk food go-to: Cookie dough ice-cream\n\nPre-skate superstitions: I always put my left skate on first!\n\nWatch Vanessa and Brian compete in Season 5 of Battle of the Blades Thursdays 8 p.m. (9AT/9:30NT) on CBC. You can also vote for her performance as soon as the show wraps!\n\n\n\nAs a member of the Battle of the Blades production team, Sara Yacobi-Harris is combining her experience as a former competitive figure skater with her current career in Unscripted Content at the CBC. She is a writer, documentarian and is currently completing a masters degree in Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto.", "description": "'Being able to articulate to someone exactly what their body needs to do and the mechanics of it is cool.
