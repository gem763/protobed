The pain becomes worse and worse. It makes even walking painful. Afterwards I get so itchy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because you feel aroused and you want to do something about it, but when you do the pain is so intense.\n\n\u201cIf I tried to masturbate, I would get sharp stabbing pains around my clitoris, and if I would try to walk I would be in so much pain.\n\n\u201cI would have to hold an ice bag down there. My relationship with my husband has been difficult and I have a lot of insecurities.\n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have intercourse often I do have insecurities about whether or not he would cheat on me.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, he married me knowing the issues I have and the barriers that creates for sex.\n\n\u201cWe have sex once or twice a year, but I do it for my husband, I have to have a couple of drinks to get through it. It hurts, it feels like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck.\u201d\n\n(Image: Natalie Bricker /SWNS.COM)\n\nThe former care assistant believes her condition is a result of a car accident she experienced 17 years ago.\n\nMrs Bricker believes she injured her pudendal nerve which is responsible for carrying messages from the external genitalia.\n\nShe appeared uninjured after the accident, but from that time, sex with Robert, who was at that time her boyfriend, began to cause pain.\n\nIt was not until 2014, that she was diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia.\n\nMrs Bricker said: \"\u201cI was involved in a car accident in 2002 where I believe all my issues began.\n\n\"I think I pinched a nerve and a month later I began suffering persistent urinary tract infections and intercourse started to hurt. I couldn\u2019t do it without pain.\n\n\u201cI could no longer even wear a tampon without pain. I was in a relationship at the time with my boyfriend, who is now my husband.\n\n\"But after this accident, I couldn\u2019t have intercourse which put pressure on my relationship with him.\n\n\u201cMy chronic pain has been progressive. Over the last four or five years it has become worse.\n\n\u201cDuring that time my dog knocked me over onto my butt and I began experiencing rectal pains. Now after every bowel movement I experience pain.\n\n\u201cI have seen many doctors about this. I have seen pelvic pain specialists to psychiatrists. It makes you feel really horrible when people suggest it is all in your mind.\"\n\n(Image: Natalie Bricker /SWNS.COM)\n\nHer pain has also ended her career as a care assistant.\n\nShe said: \"\u201cI was a personal care assistant working with people with special needs but I sadly had to give this up.\n\n\u201cI was so fatigued and I would have intense pain every time I had a bowel movement.\n\n\"I was taking a strong painkiller at work to deal with it and if I had to go, the pain and the anxiety would set in.\n\n\"I began to have panic attacks. It was a very rewarding role and I was devastated to leave my job but I couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n\nShe has tried several treatments to help relieve her pain, including pudental Botox injections and an injection to block messages to the pudendal nerve.\n\nWhile these treatments have provided minor relief, Natalie now works with a pelvic floor specialist and the \"attacks\" are now lasting for 48 hours, as opposed to four days.\n\nBut the impact of her condition is not limited to her marriage and her career.\n\n(Image: Natalie Bricker /SWNS.COM)\n\nIt has also impacted her and Robert's strong desire to start a family, which is made more difficult by her condition.\n\nMrs Bricker said: \"\u201cI always wanted children with my husband and have been through IVF. But my condition has meant it\u2019s been more difficult.\n\n\"My husband has a condition also which means we can only conceive through IVF, but because I\u2019ve been unwell we haven\u2019t tried again.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out we might consider fostering or adopting. Robert is such a good man, he married me knowing the issues I have and the barriers that creates for sex and I love him for that.\n\n\u201cWe go to marriage counselling and it\u2019s the only reason we are still together.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m missing out on a part of my life and I just have to hope that things will one day get better.\"\n\n(Image: Natalie Bricker /SWNS.COM)\n\nHer husband Robert said that he hopes one day a remedy for her condition will be found.\n\nHe said: \"I married Natalie when I knew we would have these issues because I am an eternal optimist.\n\n\u201cI love her so much and I didn\u2019t want to give up the opportunity to be with her forever, when this is something that might be resolved or managed at some point in our lives.\n\n\u201cI have hope that we\u2019re always one doctor away.\u201d", "description": "Natalie Bricker, from Delaware in the US, suffers such acute pain when she is turned on that she only has sex with her husband once a year after which she is left bedbound for four days", "authors": ["Kaisha Langton", "Image", "Natalie Bricker", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_SEX_PAIN_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
