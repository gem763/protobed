He said he gave them the money and they fixed the drain. He said he had no choice but to pay in order to get help because the smell was unbearable and their lives were at risk.\n\nMagoqoza\u2019s wife Rose said she felt sick from the smell because they were trying to drain the water by using buckets.\n\nShe said the problem is that the drain overflows because it is shared with other households.\n\n\u201cThe apartheid government built this drainage systems and no one has ever changed it. It is not the first time that this is happening,\u201d she said.\n\nThe City\u2019s spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said the \u201cold drainage systems\u201d in Gugulethu have been sufficiently designed to deal with the capacity of the discharge from the number of properties they serve, however, it is not designed to handle foreign objects such as rags and rubble or fats and sand among other things.\n\n\u201cThis causes more than 95% of the overflows in Gugulethu.\n\nHe said City officials are not allowed to solicit money or bribes from residents, and some have been dismissed for similar offences.\n\n\u201cIf residents can provide any information that could help us identify these residents we will ensure appropriate action is taken,\u201d he added.", "description": "Residents of a house that was flooded with sewage claim they had to pay out of their own pockets in order to get the City of Cape Town to fix the problem.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9455/0c361f4c94aa426b95aa840bc0d9a66b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
