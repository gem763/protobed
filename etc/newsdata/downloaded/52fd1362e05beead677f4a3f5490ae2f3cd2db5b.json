The change was announced quickly, apparently with scant consulting with local organizers or government officials.\n\nThe trigger was probably the recent world track championships in Doha, Qatar, where 28 of 68 starters failed to finish the women's marathon and 18 of 73 men failed to complete the course. The races were run at midnight in 38 degree C (100 degree F) heat.\n\nEthiopian distance-running great Haile Gebrselassie said athletes \"could have died\" in the women's race.\n\nThe marathons in Tokyo were to start at 6 a.m. to ease the heat effect on runners. The men's 50-kilometer race walk final was slated for a 5:30 a.m. start.\n\nThe IOC said a final decision would be made after games inspectors visit Tokyo for a meeting on Oct. 30-Nov. 1.\n\nLocal organizing committee president Toshiro Mori, however, said there is no choice but to accept the proposal, which he said sounded more like a decision when he received a call from IOC president Thomas Bach last week.\n\n\"Can we say no to the plan that the IOC and International Association of Athletics Federation already supported?\" Mori said. \"It's not a question of good or bad, but we just have to accept it.\"\n\nForecast temperatures in Sapporo are \"five to six degrees centigrade (about 10 degrees F) cooler during the day than in Tokyo,\" the IOC said.\n\nKoike said she wants the IOC to explain \"to all of the games stakeholders, including the citizens of Tokyo.\"\n\nMori said the size of an additional cost resulting from the change, as well as security and other logistical questions, need to be resolved.\n\nA report released last year by the national government's Board of Audit said Japan is likely to spend $25 billion overall to prepare for the games. This is public money, except for the $5.6 billion in the privately funded operating budget.\n\nOrganizers dispute the figure and say it's about $12 billion, though what are Olympic costs - and what are not - is subject to heated debate.\n\nTokyo projected total costs of about $7.5 billion in its winning bid for the games in 2013.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
