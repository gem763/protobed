According to an Instagram Story published by Hailee Steinfeld, star of Apple TV+\u2019s first potential hit series, Dickison, Apple Music student subscribers will be able to stream Apple TV+ for free.\n\nThe announcement was spotted earlier by 9to5Mac.\n\nAfter a series of Instagram-hosted Q&A\u2019s meant to stoke excitement for the show among her fans, Steinfeld announced the bundle deal by saying that: \u201cfor those of you who are students with an Apple Music student subscription, you can now get Apple TV+ for free.\u201d\n\nShe noted this means student subscribers will not only be able to watch her new show on Friday, November 1st, they can also check out her new single \u201cAfterlife\u201d with the same subscription.\n\nThe Apple Music student subscription is currently $4.99 per month, which provides full access to Apple Music\u2019s catalog of 50 million songs, live local radio stations, curated playlists, and other original content.\n\nAn Apple Music-Apple TV+ bundle had been rumored to be in the works, prompting rival Spotify to team up with Hulu to pre-emptively strike with a bundle deal of their own.\n\nBut when Apple formally announced its TV streaming service, it instead surprised everyone by offering the service for free with the purchase of a new Apple device.\n\nOf course, students are less likely to upgrade their phones and tablets as often as working adults, given the costs. That means they would have missed out on the \u201cnew device\u201d deal, and would have instead had to pay the $4.99 per month subscription for the TV service.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple TV+\u2019s debut shows have received mixed reviews from critics ahead of launch \u2014 with the star-powered The Morning Show featuring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Whitherspoon, and Steve Carell even being called \u201cdull\u201d and \u201cunderwhelming.\u201d Dickison, however, has been a bright spot, with some even saying the show is set to be Apple TV+\u2019s breakout series. It would make sense for Apple to capitalize on that attention \u2014 as well as on Steinfeld\u2019s 12.4 million Instagram followers \u2014 to get more people watching.\n\nApple didn\u2019t share any additional information about the Music/TV+ bundle beyond what Steinfeld announced. There was no related press release or even a tweet posted to the Apple TV Twitter account. In other words, Apple was narrowly targeting Steinfeld\u2019s built-in fan base with the news.\n\nIt appears this is not a limited-time deal with an expiration date attached, just an ongoing benefit of a student Music subscription.", "description": "Ahead of Friday\u2019s launch of Apple\u2019s new streaming service, Apple TV+, the company announced an Apple Music/Apple TV+ bundle deal specifically aimed at making the service more affordable for younger subscribers.
