The plan would leave just 61 employees in Washington.\n\nThe move has been contested by lawmakers, conservationists and former BLM employees who see it as a way to dismantle the agency and sideline career staffers who could present a roadblock to some energy development.\n\nThe team that produces the environmental analysis of major projects required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is one of the groups that would be hit hard by the move.\n\nUnder the plan dated Sept. 25, the 20-person NEPA team would be scattered across seven states, with 12 in Denver and one employee each in Fort Collins, Colo.; Phoenix; Reno, Nev.; Sacramento, Calif.; Anchorage, Alaska; Santa Fe, N.M.; Salt Lake City; and Billings, Mont.\n\nThis comes after Interior announced in 2017 it would streamline the NEPA process by centralizing reviews primarily among some of the highest-level Interior and BLM political appointees.\n\n\u201cThis staff is now being scattered all over,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s being replaced by this political review in Washington.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental reviews play a pivotal role as BLM considers things like whether to greenlight drilling for oil on public lands or approve lumber projects in national forests. One recent environmental impact statement reviewed how drilling would affect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n\u201cThe relocation of BLM staff has bipartisan support and will fundamentally improve the Bureau\u2019s operational efficiency and effectiveness. The assertion that these changes are to dismantle the Bureau is ignorant and out of touch with the needs of communities in the West; communities who are directly impacted by decisions currently being made more than a thousand miles away in Washington,\" Nick Goodwin, spokesman for Interior, said in an email to The Hill.\n\nGoodwin said the 2017 changes to NEPA \"shifted the responsibility for NEPA compliance to the BLM's state directors, so the need for these positions to be in DC is no longer necessary. The relocation of these planning positions to State Offices will provide greater support for environmental analyses in each state's planning areas.\u201d\n\nThe documents also show how other teams would be broken up under the plan.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Conservation and Environmental Protection division would be roughly split in two, with half going to Salt Lake City and half in Denver.\n\nEllis sees this as a problem, as it would split up an interdisciplinary team designed to look at a landscape holistically, evaluating how different parts of an ecosystem interact in order to preserve various types of habitat.\n\n\u201cI fail to see how this will be a more efficient and effective organization,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever proposed this thing knows nothing about how the organization works. They can\u2019t or they wouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 3:50 p.m.", "description": "The team that assesses the environmental impacts of major projects on the nation\u2019s public lands will be split up and spread across seven states, according to new internal documents breaking down the Bureau of Land M", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tetons-nationalpark-getty2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
