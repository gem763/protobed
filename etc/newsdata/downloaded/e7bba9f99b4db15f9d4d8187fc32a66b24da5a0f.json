His government also announced a list of reforms to address some of the grievances.\n\nBut protesters are back on the streets and have attacked the headquarters of political parties and TV stations in Baghdad.\n\nPolice responded by using live rounds and tear gas. More than 100 people have been killed in five days of protests.\n\nParliament planned to hold an emergency session on Saturday - but it never took place. However, the speaker of parliament did make some promises.\n\nSo what is next for Iraq? And will the government find a solution to this crisis?\n\nPresenter: Peter Dobbie\n\nDlawer Ala'Aldeen - president at the Middle East Research Institute\n\nRenad Mansour - research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House\n\nZeidon Alkinani - contributor at Open Democracy\n\nSource: Al Jazeera News", "description": "Protesters are demanding the prime minister to step down, but the government responds by announcing a list of reforms.", "authors": ["Inside Story"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/3c31098570d84537bfee7439ced9615b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
