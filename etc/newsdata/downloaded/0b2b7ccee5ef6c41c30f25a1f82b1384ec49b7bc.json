(AP) - A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee\u2019s 48-hour waiting period law for abortions.\n\nOver the course of four days, the state tried to show the law benefits women by allowing them time to reflect. Attorneys representing five of the state\u2019s seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and creates significant burdens.\n\nExperts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain, and some women later regret their decisions. But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of women seeking abortions. The experts also disagreed on whether a waiting period would make any difference for those women.\n\nThe trial ended Thursday with U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman saying he would try to rule quickly.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period law for abortions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Travis Loller"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
