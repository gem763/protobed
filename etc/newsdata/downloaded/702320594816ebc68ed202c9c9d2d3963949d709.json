Rather than disqualifying Justify, the California Horse Racing Board allegedly delayed, and ultimately dismissed, its inquiry into the failed test, in a departure from its normal standards.\n\nWhile both the CHRB and Justify\u2019s renowned trainer, Bob Baffert, have denied wrongdoing, some pundits are citing the case as proof that horse racing\u2019s system of state-by-state regulation is fundamentally flawed, hurting competition and putting animals at risk. Advocates of the Horseracing Integrity Act, a bipartisan Congressional bill that would regulate the sport at the federal level, argue that standardized anti-doping would improve its integrity at a time when fan attendance beyond the Triple Crown and Breeder's Cup continues to dwindle.\n\nHorses \u201ccan be charged with an overage of a drug or use of an illegal drug in Arkansas and New York (racetracks) and have completely different punishments, so there\u2019s no uniformity,\u201d Valerie Pringle, a campaign manager for equine protection at the Humane Society, told FOX Business. \u201cThat\u2019d be like the Redskins and the Raiders and the Patriots all having different rules. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBeyond the decline in attendance, the signs of shrinking fan interest in the once-mainstream sport -- billed as the \"sport of kings\" -- is the number of racehorses foaled in North America declined from more than 44,000 in 1990 to less than 21,000 in 2019, according to the Jockey Club. Also, wagering at U.S. events regularly topped $16 billion annually in the early 2000s, but fell to roughly $11.2 billion in 2018, according to Equibase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wave of 29 horse deaths at the famous Santa Anita Park in 2019 led California Gov. Gavin Newsom to call on regulators to shutter the facility and submit to independent inspections by veterinarians. Misused drugs and medications are believed to be contributing factors.\n\nCHRB CEO Rick Baedeker told KPBS in San Diego in August that while sagging revenue suggests the overall horse-racing industry is \u201con the decline,\u201d improved regulations would help reassure the public that the sport is safe.\n\n\u201cThe game is healthy \u2014 but it\u2019s only going to stay healthy if ... the public is convinced that everything is being done that can be done to protect the race horse,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the case of Justify, officials rejected the notion that regulators\u2019 handling of the situation was evidence of foul play.\n\nBaffert said he \u201cunequivocally\u201d rejects allegations that he knowingly gave Justify a banned substance, arguing that the failed test was \u201cobvious environmental contamination\u201d that is \u201ca known problem in California.\u201d In other words, Justify likely ingested the substance outside of his monitored intake.\n\nTop CHRB medical official Rick Arthur said the amount of the banned substance was \u201cminiscule\u201d and that several other horses also tested positive. Based on his findings, he recommended that regulators drop the case.\n\n\"We take seriously the integrity of horse racing in California and are committed to implementing the highest standards of safety and accountability for all horses, jockeys and participants,\u201d the CHRB said in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFor critics, the Horseracing Integrity Act is one possible way to prevent similar scandals. The bill is under consideration in both congressional houses and has drawn bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cI think that it is going to drive some fans away, but what they have to understand is, there\u2019s a fix, and the fix is this federal bill. The reason it has to be a federal bill is because it has to be in a position where it can trump all of the state racing commissions,\u201d Pringle added.", "description": "Outside of the Triple Crown and other major events, there are signs of declining interest in the once-mainstream sport.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Justify-Baffert.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
