Some adjustments require buy-in from executives outside transportation departments, he said, such as changing when products are shipped to avoid pushing out loads at busy periods.\n\nThe delays put added pressure on drivers hustling to pick up their next load. Federal rules limit most truckers to 11 hours of driving in a 14-hour workday, so drivers held up at one stop may speed or drive while tired to make up the time. A 15-minute increase in average dwell time raises the expected crash rate for a truck by 6.2%, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. Transportation Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General.\n\nMost truck drivers get paid by the mile. Many receive hourly detention rates, but trucking companies don\u2019t always charge shippers those fees, and the length of time drivers sit around before the fees begin can vary based on contractual agreements. Driver detention is estimated to cost drivers and trucking companies more than $1 billion annually in lost revenue, according to the 2018 DOT report.\n\n\u201cDetention time or downtime is cutting into your gross money,\u201d said Tommy Wade, 66, of Orleans, Ind., who drove trucks for 40 years before retiring in November.\n\nOne finding of the survey was that women often end up waiting more than their male counterparts, with 55% of female drivers in 2018 reporting delays because of actions at a customer facility compared with 47% for men. Female drivers interviewed by the group suggested that men could be more likely to speak out about delays.\n\n\u201cIt looks like women are just more patient but the consequences are a financial one and it hits them in the pocketbook,\u201d said Mr. Murray.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Truckers are spending more time waiting at the loading dock, leading to delays that cut into earnings of trucking companies and drivers and, ultimately, add to consumer costs.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104285/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
