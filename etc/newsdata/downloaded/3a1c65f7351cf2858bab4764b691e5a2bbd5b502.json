You won\u2019t notice an overnight transformation, but if you keep at it for a month or so, you\u2019ll be so pleasantly surprised: After I used it for a couple of weeks, my dark marks were faded, some crows filled out, and my under eyes were generally smoother. The stuff is made up of 80 percent collagen (which means it\u2019s incredible for plumping up that under-eye skin), as well as niacinamide (one of the best brightening ingredients out there). And best of all, it does all of this without creating any irritation, which is the main reason it won a spot on my Google Doc list this year. The balmy consistency of this product is also great for creating a really smooth, nourished base for under-eye makeup. I reach for this one on days where my eyes are calmer and less irritated, so I can give them some much-needed, intensive brightening treatment; if you don\u2019t deal with under-eye irritation, you could get away with using it daily.", "description": "Best Under Eye Healing and Concealing Products 2019  including Benton Snail Bee Ultimate Hydrogel Eye Patch, Wish Formula The Bat Eye Mask with Centella Honey Fermented Essence, COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream and RMS Uncover-up.", "authors": ["Rio Viera-Newton"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/09/09-eyemask.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
