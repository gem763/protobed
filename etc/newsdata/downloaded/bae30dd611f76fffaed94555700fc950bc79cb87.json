Last year, multi-national hotel chain Marriott had a massive data breach where 500 million guests had their information compromised, including their passport information.

Unfortunately, as the Marriott breach has proven, nothing is 100% failsafe.\n\nHowever, the easiest and quickest way to secure your identity is to get a new passport as soon as you suspect your data has been compromised.\n\nREAD: What to do when your SA passport gets stolen\n\n*Compiled by Gabi Zietsman\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
