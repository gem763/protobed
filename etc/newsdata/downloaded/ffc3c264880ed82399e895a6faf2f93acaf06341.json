We've changed a lot, we're improving and there are still things to fix but I'm very happy.\n\n'We did a great job with Allegri, but with Sarri we've improved. My position has changed a bit. I always try to occupy the areas on the pitch where I feel best. I like to have freedom of movement.'\n\nHe said Massimiliano Allegri 'did a great job' at Juventus, but said the team are now improved\n\nWhile taking home the Serie A crown is always expected in Turin, Champions League glory is something that has always eluded Juventus.\n\nAnd it is an accolade Ronaldo is targeting this season - brushing aside any personal ambitions. They currently top Group D with four points from two games.\n\n'We must fight to assert ourselves again in the League and try to win the Champions League,' he added. 'This is our objective. Collective results are important. As for the Ballon d'Or, I have nothing to say about it.\n\n'It's not important whether I win it or not. If there are individual awards, it'll be the result of results with the team.\n\nHe is eyeing Champions League glory this season after reaching the quarter-finals last year\n\n'Now we have a match to play, I'm thinking about that and nothing else. I like what he asks us to do on the field.'\n\nThe Portuguese captain has netted five goals overall this season, and although Juventus have been outscored by their rivals in the top four, the 34-year-old says he is happy with how the team are playing and their chance creation.\n\n'Compared to the past, we're creating more chances. We're having great possession and we move around differently.\n\n'I'm very happy with how things are going with the new coach. I'm satisfied and happy with what we're doing.'", "description": "The former Chelsea boss succeeded Massimiliano Allegri at the Old Lady, with the unwanted task of following a man who delivered eight successive Serie A titles in Turin.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/16/19997956-0-image-a-130_1571672645508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
