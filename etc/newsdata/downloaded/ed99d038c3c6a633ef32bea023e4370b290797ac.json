A Serbian study showed the prevalence of \u201can unknown pregnancy during the first 20 weeks is 1 in 475 pregnancies, in the second half of pregnancy it is 1 in 2 455 pregnancies and at the moment of delivery it is 1 in 7 225\u201d.\n\nReasons\n\nMost people, especially women, often wonder: How can you not know you are pregnant?

Even without a history of mental illness external stressors such as financial difficulties or relationship problems can cause such psychological distress that a woman \u201cblocks out\u201d her pregnancy.\n\nResearch also suggests an evolutionary response called \u201cforced cooperation\u201d between mother and foetus.
