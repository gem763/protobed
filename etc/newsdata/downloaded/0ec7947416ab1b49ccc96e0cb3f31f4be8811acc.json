Michael Sanchez, the brother of Lauren Sanchez, was later accused of supplying the texts to the Enquirer.\n\nThe Enquirer's publication of them prompted speculation that it was attempting to curry favor with President Trump, who has often described critical coverage in the Post as \"fake news.\" That could have violated an immunity deal between American Media Inc., which owned the tabloid, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors there had agreed not to pursue campaign finance law violations by the company related to its payment in a \"catch and kill\" scheme to bury stories about Trump's relationship with an ex-Playboy model during the 2016 campaign as long as the company implemented policies to ensure it complied with the law in the future.\n\nIn Bezos' post on Medium, he said AMI threatened to publish the photos unless \"I make the specific false public statement to the press that we \u2018have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u2019\u201d The Enquirer believed it was a deal he couldn't refuse, Bezos wrote, but he decided to make its attempts public rather than going along.\n\nAMI said in a statement at the time that it believed its actions were legal and that negotiations with Bezos were in \"good faith.\"", "description": "Bezos alleged the tabloid, then owned by American Media Inc., was attempting to blackmail and extort him with the threat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
