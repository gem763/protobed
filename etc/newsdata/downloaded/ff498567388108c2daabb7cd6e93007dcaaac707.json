A few little changes here and there might hopefully cause a bit of a reaction.\u201d", "description": "The United States has long been considered a sleeping giant of professional rugby, but is ready to rise and shine at the World Cup in Japan.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
