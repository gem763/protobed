The right to bear arms had deep roots in England, and predated the Constitution on these shores. Pennsylvania guaranteed the right early on. In his draft of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cNo freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\u201d (His language wasn\u2019t adopted.)\n\nIt is out of this historical and jurisprudential soil that we got the Second Amendment. Guns would make it possible for Americans to defend themselves, and to defend their liberties.\n\nAlexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist of the importance of \u201cthe original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government.\u201d This right can be used if necessary, per Hamilton, \u201cagainst the usurpations of the national rulers.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
