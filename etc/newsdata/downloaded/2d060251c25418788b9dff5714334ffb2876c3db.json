(Edward Grazda)\n\n\n\nA man holds a bottle on New York's Bowery. (Edward Grazda)\n\nFor some, New York City\u2019s Bowery conjures visions of desolation. The word used to be synonymous with the drunk, destitute and down and out: Think of the \u201cbowery bum.\u201d But today New York\u2019s Bowery district is far removed from its seedy past.\n\nThe area in southern Manhattan has been gentrifying for years. Up until the late 20th century, it was still a place full of cheap hotels and dive bars, but then it all began to change. Now it is home to luxury steel, glass and brink condos and apartment buildings, with the accompanying high-end grocery stores. Where once stood CBGB, the famed venue where punk and new wave acts such as the Ramones and the Talking Heads played, there\u2019s now a John Varvatos boutique.\n\nIn the 1970s, however, the Bowery was still home to a host of men wandering the bars, drinking on the streets and panhandling. Photographer Edward Grazda\u2019s new book, \u201cOn the Bowery\u201d (powerHouse, 2019), preserves that history. It is dedicated in the opening pages to Lionel Rogosin\u2019s 1956 film of the same title. Grazda\u2019s photos, taken some 15 years after the film, match the gritty, grimy reality that Rogosin recorded.\n\nGrazda shot the photos in his book over a period of several months from September to December 1971 while staying with friends in their loft on the Bowery near Grand Street. He initially shelved the photos he took of the men populating the area because he thought they were too intrusive. But in 1999 while at the MacDowell Colony, an artists\u2019 colony, he revisited the work and decided to make a book.\n\nThe black-and-white photos of men sitting in doorways drinking, sidling up to cars on the street looking for change and sitting in dingy bars are gritty and loose. In that way, they mirror the subjects\u2019 lives in the four borders of the frames. The people in the photos seem to be on a long day\u2019s journey into night, echoing an old saying Grazda recounts at the end of the book, \u201cThe Bowery is the longest street in America: Once you get on it you never get off.\u201d And while Grazda left the Bowery at the end of 1971, he notes: \u201cI was lucky: I got off the Bowery, most of these men did not.\u201d\n\nYou can find out more about the book here.\n\n\n\nA man smokes outside a hotel on the Bowery.
