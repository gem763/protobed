More\n\nIt started with a slow day at work\n\nI was watching highlights of a Joe Rogan Experience podcast on YouTube while I was at work. It was super slow, so I was clicking through videos \u2013 and watching that brought the Area 51 mystery to the forefront of my mind. And on June 27, I was reading online about the Facebook event wars to steal all of Minnesota\u2019s lakes \u2013 which are all these meme events. Reading that, already having the Area 51 mystery on my mind, I was like: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a joke event, too!\u201d So I created the \u201cStorm Area 51 \u2013 They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us\u201d Facebook post. Over the course of three days, it went absolutely nowhere. Like four people interested, and then it stopped.\n\nNye County: 'Storm Area 51' event forces second Nevada county to sign emergency declaration\n\nLincoln County: 'Storm Area 51' event pushes rural Nevada county to declare emergency\n\nThings started getting weird\n\nOn July 1, it just started picking up a ton of traction. And on July 2, it got posted on Reddit and blew up again. And after that it started hitting the news. And after it hit the news, it absolutely took off to this crazy, multinational monstrosity of an event. From there, it\u2019s been a really interesting ride.\n\nThe FBI showed up to his door\n\nI wasn\u2019t home, so they gave me a call. I let it go to voicemail, because it wasn\u2019t a number I recognized, you know? So I called them back, and the agent answered. They basically wanted to know where I was, when I was going to be home, what I was doing \u2013 they just wanted to talk.\n\nSo at this point, I do not want to go home at all right now. It kind of freaked me out. But I ended up going back, and they met me there. We sat down and talked for about an hour.\n\nMusic festival: After 'Storm Area 51' gets 2 million RSVPs, its creator announces alien-themed music fest\n\nDestination: Belize offers free trips to residents of Nevada town who want to escape 'Storm Area 51'\n\nThey asked me a laundry list of questions. Basically, their main concerns were about anybody that was sending death threats that were actually credible and anybody that was actually trying to radicalize this thing. People that think it\u2019s legitimately serious \u2013 that we\u2019re actually going to show up and storm the base. People who are planning to bring guns and things. There\u2019s been a few of those people pop up, so I\u2019ve just sent them to the FBI. I don\u2019t want any of that.\n\nI don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to threaten the lives of a lot of people, especially with mass shootings for some damn reason being popular right now. I\u2019ve been very wary about that. Safety has been our number one priority. You can\u2019t have a fun, enjoyable event if there\u2019s no safety involved. There will be plenty of law enforcement working outside of the event, and we\u2019ve got a lot of security monitoring this thing to make sure it\u2019s safe for everybody involved.", "description": "Matty Roberts says the Facebook event started as a joke, but after more than 2 million RSVPs, it's become an extraterrestrial-themed music fest.", "authors": ["Ed Komenda", "Reno Gazette Journal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jw98bh3lX.nGbDreRV3eow--~B/aD02Mjg7dz04MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/4cba430da4a192b6a2a7115779211e64", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
