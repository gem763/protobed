There are some signs her strategy is working. She said she had raised money from nearly every ZIP code in her district. (Ms. Beatty, who hasn\u2019t reported third-quarter fund-raising, had $1.3 million cash on hand as of July.)\n\nMs. Harper has focused on residents left out of the recent growth of Columbus \u2014 now Ohio\u2019s most dynamic city, surpassing Cleveland \u2014 and the gentrification that has followed.\n\nA wave of new apartment blocks, craft breweries and espresso shops radiating from downtown has pushed out poor residents, many of them black. Ms. Harper\u2019s website calls Columbus the second most economically segregated city in the country.\n\nIn the barbershop, Mr. Copeland, the retired principal, said he was a personal friend of Ms. Beatty from \u201cway back,\u201d but that wouldn\u2019t cement his vote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a bad state of affairs,\u201d he said, referring to local and national events. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at elections and who we\u2019re going to be sending to Congress and that sort of thing, we\u2019re probably in a position where good friends and all that kind of stuff is going to go by the wayside.\u201d", "description": "Morgan Harper is challenging Representative Joyce Beatty in a solid blue Ohio district, the latest front in the Democratic clash between left and far left.", "authors": ["Trip Gabriel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/us/politics/13ohioprimary-01/13ohioprimary-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
