Johnson indicated he would try again, saying an election was the only way forward for the country, and accusing opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn of being afraid of the public's judgment.\n\n\"The obvious conclusion, I'm afraid, is that he does not think he will win,\" Johnson said.\n\nScarcely six weeks after taking office with a vow to break Britain's Brexit deadlock \u2014 which entrapped and finally defeated his predecessor, Theresa May \u2014 Johnson's own plans to lead the U.K. out of the EU are in crisis.\n\nJohnson insists Britain must leave the bloc on the scheduled date of Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal, but many lawmakers \u2014 including several from Johnson's Conservative Party \u2014 are determined to thwart him. On Wednesday the House of Commons approved an opposition bill designed to halt a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJohnson accused the opposition of trying to \"overturn the biggest democratic vote in our history,\" referring to the outcome of the 2016 referendum to leave the EU.\n\nHis solution, a risky one, is an election that could shake up Parliament and produce a less obstructive crop of lawmakers. But opinion polls do not point to a certain majority for Johnson's Conservatives, and on Wednesday Johnson did not get the general election he craves \u2014 at least not yet. Opposition parties, deeply mistrustful of the prime minister, refused to back a new election until the anti-no deal bill becomes law.\n\n\"Let the bill pass and have Royal Assent and then we can have a general election,\" Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson needed the support of two-thirds of the 650 lawmakers in the House of Commons to trigger an election \u2014 a total of 434 \u2014 but got just 298, with 56 voting no and the rest abstaining.\n\nJohnson signaled that he would try again to trigger a snap election, urging opposition lawmakers to \"reflect overnight and in the course of the next few days.\"\n\nThe maneuvers are part of a head-on showdown between Johnson's Brexit-at-all-costs administration and a Parliament worried about the economic and social damage that could be wrought by a messy divorce.\n\nOpposition lawmakers, supported by rebels in Johnson's Conservative Party, warn that crashing out of the bloc without a divorce agreement would cause irreparable economic harm.\n\nIn a second straight day of parliamentary turmoil, the House of Commons voted by 327-299 in favor of an opposition bill to block a no-deal Brexit, sending it to Parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords. Even so, the bill's fate is unsure. With Johnson set to suspend Parliament for several weeks starting next week, pro-Brexit peers in the Lords are threatening to try to stop it by filibustering until time runs out.\n\n\"There is very little time left,\" said Labour Party lawmaker Hilary Benn as he introduced the opposition bill. \"The purpose of the bill is very simple: to ensure that the United Kingdom does not leave the European Union on the 31st of October without an agreement.\"\n\nThe bill would require the government to ask the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, 2020, if it can't secure a deal with the bloc by late October.\n\nThe lawmakers hope to pass the bill into law \u2014 a process that can take months \u2014 by the end of the week, because Johnson plans to suspend Parliament at some point next week until Oct. 14.\n\nJohnson became prime minister in July by promising to lead Britain out of the EU, breaking the impasse that has paralyzed the country's politics since voters decided in June 2016 to leave the bloc. But he is caught between the EU, which refuses to renegotiate the deal it stuck with May, and a majority of British lawmakers opposed to leaving without an agreement. Most economists say a no-deal Brexit would cause severe economic disruption and plunge the U.K. into recession.\n\nJohnson insisted Wednesday that talks with the EU on a revised deal were \"making substantial progress.\"\n\nBut the bloc says the U.K. has not submitted any substantial new proposals. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said \"there is nothing new\" from London.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Wednesday for a national election on Oct. 15, saying it was the only way out of Britain's Brexit impasse after lawmakers moved to block his plan to leave the European Union next month without a divorce deal.
