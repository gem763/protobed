A second group was led by the rapper Drillminister, who also performed one of his tracks.\n\nThe event, part of a day of Windrush-themed celebrations at Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton, was produced by model, designer and campaigner Eunice Olumide, who also created the collection on show.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Jamelia, Eunice Olumide, Nish Kumar and Richard Pascoe.

There is something fascinating about the way the culture of the Windrush generation affected the UK so significantly in terms of dress and style and fashion, as well as music. They influenced ska, punk, and other subgroups and cultures coming out of that period.\u201d\n\nAhead of the show itself, attendees were invited to listen to free fashion and sustainability presentations, music performances and panel discussions with comedian Nish Kumar, as well as singer Jamelia, who later attended the fashion show.\n\nQuick guide Who was onboard the Windrush?

There is also currently a petition to erect a memorial in Brixton\u2019s Windrush Square, opposite the town hall, rather than the government proposed location of Waterloo station.\n\n\u201cThe fashion industry has long been linked to revolution, anarchy and significant change within culture and society,\u201d said Olumide. \u201cIt is an area where marginalised groups have often been able to bring recognition to various serious social, economic and environmental issues within everyday life.\u201d", "description": "Catwalk show and day of events in Brixton highlight positive impact of Windrush generation", "authors": ["Leah Harper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/499581299ebb37a43ec720c659470f7e66e37dbf/0_221_8123_4873/master/8123.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5808ea59bc7277cfce969dd86e751498", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
