Ragnar\u2019s quest to become Earl was relentless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And, his desire to raid England was voracious. But, with victory came loss. If you could ask Odin to change the course of history, what would it be? Or is it \u201csometimes better not to know one\u2019s fate.\u201d\u2019\n\nUnderstandably, the post proved too much with the comments compiling of more broken heart emojis than any actual words.\n\n\u2018Still not remotely over Ragnar\u2019s death,\u2019 and \u2018I MISS RAGNAR SO MUCH,\u2019 kicked things off, while a particularly devastated fan cried: \u2018Bring back Ragnar!\u2019\n\nAnother agreed: \u2018Make Ragnar come back alive!!!\u2019\n\nDespite various rumblings on Reddit Ragnar could return dead or alive, Hirst confirmed Bjorn\u2019s (Alexander Ludwig) vision would be the last time we\u2019d ever see his father or any of the ghosts from the past five seasons.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not really the kind of show where I bring dead people back particularly,\u2019 he told Variety. \u2018So it was always going to be Bjorn\u2019s intense flashback to that very significant moment in his life, when Ragnar tried to tell him things about power.\n\n\u2018The thing is, whatever someone tells you, the reality is you have to learn these things for yourself.\u2019\n\nAs for what\u2019s in store, we now have a brutal new trailer which lays it all out here:\n\nVikings returns to History Channel on December 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
