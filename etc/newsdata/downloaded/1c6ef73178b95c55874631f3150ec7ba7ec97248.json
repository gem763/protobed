On Thursday, visitors waited for hours on opening day to get on the \u201cMillennium Falcon: Smuggler\u2019s Run\u201d ride under blue skies and bright sun for the first time ever.\n\nThe company promoted the opening via twitter on August 29.\n\nLive your adventure while searching for leaders of the Resistance at Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge. Now open! #StarWars #GalaxysEdge \u2014 Walt Disney World (@WaltDisneyWorld) August 29, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, via twitter, the company said; \"Walt Disney World Resort is operating as normal. We are monitoring the weather, as nothing is more important than safety. Check our website for updates\" ...\n\nThe House of Mouse can't seem to catch a break. This may be the second rocky debut of \"Star Wars\" lands in a row for the theme park operator.\n\nAs reported by FOX Business, Disneyland in California was forced to cut workers hours this summer due to poor attendance after opening their own new Galaxy\u2019s Edge.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nWhile Disney World will have an act of God to blame for the poor opening attendance, Disney CEO Bob Iger gave a more practical excuse, citing fear of crowds, for keeping \"Star Wars\" fans away from the Anaheim park when he poor park attendance reports to shareholders and investors on the company's last earnings call.\n\nEither way, die-hard \"Star Wars\" fans may begin to suspect the dark side of the force is at work against Disney.\n\nHurricane Dorian is expected to strike southern Florida Monday morning with the force of a category 4 storm. Orlando, further up the coast and slightly inland, may only catch the storm at a category 1 level and not until Tuesday morning, say weather experts. But by that point, the damage may already be done.\n\nMany park-goers and \"Star Wars\" lovers are already running from the storm and changing plans out of concern for safety. Before the threat of Hurricane Dorian, Jessica Armesto and her 1-year-old daughter, Mila, planned to go to the Halloween party and attend a breakfast with Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy at Disney World.\n\nInstead, Armesto now plans to be sheltered at her mother\u2019s hurricane-resistant house in Miami with a kitchen full of nonperishable foods in case the power goes out. \u201cIt felt like it was better to be safe than sorry so we canceled our plans,\u201d Armesto told the AP.\n\n\u201cIt is the perfect storm,\u201d said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services Inc., an Ohio-based consulting firm. \u201cHere they\u2019ve been waiting to open this \u2014 the attraction was delayed from the earlier part of the season \u2014 and they finally get situated to get it opened and they have a hurricane.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, it may be just a blip for Disney, but the storm\u2019s impact for the week could cost Disney $60 million to $90 million as locals stay away to make hurricane preparations and out-of-town tourists cancel their reservations, Speigel said.\n\nDuring past hurricanes, Disney World in Florida has closed the gates to its four parks \u2014 Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. Disney World hotels remained open, but the parks were closed briefly during Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016.\n\nOn any given day, Disney World can host more than 300,000 visitors.\n\nFOX Business' inquiries to Disney were not returned at the time of publication.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "Star Wars land in Florida's Disney World bracing for hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/AP19058860099684.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
