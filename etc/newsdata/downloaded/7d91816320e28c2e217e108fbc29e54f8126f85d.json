In what appeared to be a response, an air strike at \"around midnight\" left 18 pro-Iranian fighters dead in eastern Syria, a monitor said.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights could not confirm whether that raid was Israeli.\n\nLater Monday, the Israeli army said rockets had been fired from Syria but failed to reach their targets.\n\nHezbollah had issued a statement saying that some of its fighters \"confronted with the appropriate weapons an Israeli drone\" heading towards the Lebanese border village of Ramyeh overnight.\n\nThe Shiite militant group said it subsequently retrieved the device, but did not provide pictures.\n\nAn Israeli army spokeswoman told AFP a drone \"fell\" in Lebanese territory, adding that \"there is no risk of a breach of information\".\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah chief said late Monday during an event marking a Shiite religious holiday that his movement and Iran were engaged in a \"great battle\" against Israel and the United States.\n\n\"Tonight and tomorrow we will tell (US President Donald) Trump and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu that we are a nation and nothing affects our will -- not siege, sanction, poverty or hunger.\"\n\nMonday's incident was part of an escalation between the two foes that started on August 24 when an Israeli strike killed two Hezbollah operatives in Syria.\n\nThe operation was followed hours later by what Hezbollah described as an Israeli drone attack on its Beirut stronghold.\n\nThat led to an escalation in rhetoric and heightened fears of all-out conflict between Hezbollah and Israel whose main allies, Iran and the United States respectively, are also at loggerheads.\n\nOn September 1, Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military vehicle and battalion headquarters and Israel responded with a salvo of artillery shells.\n\n- Strike in Syria -\n\nAnalysts said the cross-border exchange, which caused no injuries, was a highly choreographed move aimed at flexing muscles without igniting war.\n\nHezbollah had warned last week that its actions were only a response to the late August strike in Syria and not to the drone incident in Beirut, for which separate retaliation was to come.\n\nSources close to the organisation had said its fighters would down an Israeli drone over Lebanon at the first opportunity.\n\nThe Britain-based Observatory reported that, probably moments later, a strike by an unidentified aircraft killed 18 pro-Iranian fighters in eastern Syria.\n\nThe attack consisted of \"five missiles targeting an Iranian compound, an ammunition depot and three other military positions\", the Observatory said, adding that Iranians were among the dead.\n\nThe strike took place in the region of Albu Kamal, a town which lies along the Euphrates, on Syria's eastern border with Iraq.\n\nHezbollah military media quoted a \"security source in Syria\" accusing Israel of launching the attack, although there was no official statement from Damascus.\n\nThe source said that the strike hit an under-construction base belonging to the Syrian army and its allies. He added that the base was empty, and therefore the attack did not cause any casualties.\n\nNeither Israel nor the US-led coalition, which carries out air strikes in the area against jihadist sleeper cells, commented on the incident.\n\n- Multiple fronts -\n\nAlbu Kamal lies in Deir Ezzor province which covers much of Syria's remote eastern desert, where the Islamic State group's so-called \"caliphate\" made its last stand this year.\n\nControl of the area is split between US-backed Kurdish fighters and groups aligned with the Damascus regime, which is supported by Iran and Russia.\n\nIn June 2018, strikes near the Iraqi border killed 55 pro-regime forces, mostly Syrians and Iraqis.\n\nAn Israeli military statement said Monday that rockets had been fired from Syria but all failed to hit Israeli territory.\n\n\"The rockets were launched from the outskirts of Damascus by Shiite militia operatives operating under the Iranian Quds Force,\" it said.\n\nThe force is the elite branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and is commanded by Qassem Soleimani, the mastermind of Tehran's military strategy in the region.", "description": "The Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said Monday it had downed and seized an Israeli drone as it flew across the Lebanese border, a week after a flash confrontation between the arch-foes.
