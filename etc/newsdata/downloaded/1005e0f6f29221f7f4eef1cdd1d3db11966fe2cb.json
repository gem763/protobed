The number of likes and reactions (such as hearts and other emojis) on posts and photos, along with the number of video views, will be visible only to the authors of posts as part of the test.\n\nThe test to hide like counts comes just two months after the Facebook-owned Instagram rolled out a similar test, hiding others\u2019 like counts for select users in seven countries.\n\nRead more: It looks like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube want to kill the popularity metrics they invented\n\n\u201cWe are running a limited test where like, reaction, and video view counts are made private across Facebook,\u201d a Facebook representative told Business Insider in a statement. \u201cWe will gather feedback to understand whether this change will improve people\u2019s experiences.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s experiment in hiding like counts was first uncovered earlier this month by the reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong.\n\nIn the cases of both Facebook and Instagram, the goal has been to shift focus to the quality of content posted, rather than the quantity of likes and views these posts accrue. Instagram\u2019s head, Adam Mosseri, told BuzzFeed News earlier this year that taking away likes on the platform would help create \u201ca less pressurized environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves.\u201d\n\nBattling for likes and comparing numbers have transformed social media into a sort of popularity contest, which many say is taking a toll on the mental health of users \u2013 particularly social-media-savvy teens.\n\nSeveral studies and numerous psychologists have found a link between the amount of time teens spend on social media and depression. Celebrities such as Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato have publicly spoken out about needing to take breaks from their social-media accounts to care for their mental health. Gomez has said social media has been \u201cdangerous\u201d for both herself and for teens.\n\nAny number of people who have spent time on social media can attest to its addictive qualities, which are even apparent in this viral video of a chimpanzee mindlessly scrolling through an Instagram feed.\n\nBut Facebook and Instagram aren\u2019t the only platforms to weigh the effects of like counts on the mental health of its users. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has said if he had to go back and redesign the platform, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t even have a like count in the first place.\u201d Dorsey has floated the idea before of getting rid of the \u201clike\u201d button to ensure the platform is \u201cincentivizing healthy conversation,\u201d but Twitter has denied that will happen anytime soon. YouTube has also recently made moves to eliminate some popularity metrics from its platform.", "description": "Business Insider - Facebook is said to be hiding like and reaction counts on its platform in a test starting Friday for a limited number of users in Australia..
