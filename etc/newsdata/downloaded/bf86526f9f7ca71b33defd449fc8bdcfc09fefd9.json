Luxury Developer Candy May Bid for Massive Swath of London Land\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A group led by luxury property developer Nicholas Candy is considering making an offer for Capital & Counties Properties (LON: ), whose stock has cratered amid London prime real esate\u2019s longest slump in decades.\n\nCapco\u2019s shares rose 8% in London on Monday, valuing the firm at 2.3 billion pounds ($2.8 billion). The stock had lost nearly half its value from its 2015 peak before today\u2019s gains as the company struggled to find buyers for its holdings in the Earls Court district of London.\n\nCandy has held early stage talks with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund about a joint move to take over CapCo, the Sunday Times reported over the weekend. Nicholas and his brother Christian are the developers responsible for the Qatari-backed luxury One Hyde Park apartments in London\u2019s Belgravia neighborhood.\n\nThere\u2019s no certainty that an offer will be made, according to a statement on Monday from Candy Ventures, the investment company controlled by Nicholas. The group will make an announcement by Nov. 18 of its intention.\n\nCapCo has struggled with its Earls Court holdings as London\u2019s prime real estate market endures the longest slump in decades. Independent valuers have cut the price of land in the capital\u2019s upmarket district since 2015. The company has been weighing the sale of the land, which has planning permission for about 7,500 homes, but so far the bids have all come in below book value.\n\nCapCo said in July it planned to spin off its holdings in the London tourist and shopping haven of Covent Garden as a separate listed company after it couldn\u2019t find buyers for its assets in the Earls Court district. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\n\nThe value of Capco\u2019s stake in land in the Earls Court district was 389 million pounds as of June 30, down 15.9% from December.", "description": "Luxury Developer Candy May Bid for Massive Swath of London Land", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE990V4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
