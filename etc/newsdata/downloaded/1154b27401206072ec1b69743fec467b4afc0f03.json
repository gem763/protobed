Some 1,300 still missing in the hard-hit islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco, although the government has said many could be in shelters and with loved ones.\n\n\u201cI think some persons can\u2019t believe that it happened, and others are still processing it,\u201d said Pastor Robert Lockhart of Calvary Temple in Grand Bahama.\n\nHe opened his pulpit on Sunday to more than 200 people in attendance, offering to let congregants share their story as part of an island-wide effort to prevent what officials warn could become a mental health crisis as hundreds struggle to absorb the extent of the devastation.\n\nOnly six people spoke, but the crowd clapped and cried with them.\n\n\u201cThey needed to have an outlet and share these emotions,\u201d Lockhart said. \u201cPeople felt like they were going to die.\u201d\n\nAmong those who shared survival stories was 49-year-old Carlos Evans, who began to use a wheelchair after he was injured while working at an oil refinery. He recalled how he kept shining the light from his cellphone on the rising water as he tried not to panic. The water finally stopped surging when it reached his chest, and he waited alone for nearly two days until he was rescued.\n\n\u201cI wanted to encourage somebody else,\u201d he said of his decision to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s not just dem going through it, it\u2019s all of us.\u201d\n\nDorian hit the northern Bahamas on Sept. 1 with winds of 185 mph, unleashing flooding that reached levels of up to 25 feet (8 meters) in some areas and remaining nearly stationary for a day and a half. It flattened homes, swept away children and adults and stripped people of their most treasured possessions, leading the U.N. Secretary General to call the storm a \u201cCategory Hell.\u201d\n\nMembers of the International Medical Corps expected to open a clinic on Monday in High Rock in eastern Grand Bahama - one of the hardest hit communities - to help those who have physical injuries or are struggling emotionally.\n\nBut mental health specialist Eoin Ryan said it will take a couple of weeks or even months to determine the storm\u2019s psychological toll. He also said many are still seeking food, water and shelter and will deal with the emotional impact once they\u2019re out of shock.\n\nSusan Mangicaro, senior adviser for the team\u2019s emergency response unit, said that reactions from survivors in the Bahamas are similar to those she saw in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot more shock because entire villages were demolished overnight,\u201d she said.\n\nFor now, some are still in a daze.\n\nEulese Cooper, a 46-year-old fisherwoman from Grand Bahama, was one of those processing her loss as she sifted aimlessly through her family\u2019s belongings in the fishing village of McLean\u2019s Town.\n\nShe had a gash on her head and said she was recovering from a concussion after a truck she was riding in hit a fallen wire that snapped on her head.\n\nThe doctors advised her to rest, but she could not.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m sleeping, I have nightmares,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One woman and her husband huddled on top of a bedroom dresser for two days, surrounded by floodwaters.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "D\u00e1nica Coto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/aptopix_bahamas_hurricane_dorian_61604_c0-114-2730-1705_s1770x1032.jpg?bba3477c7909336b149ac3c2cf64b8b1c57b0ede", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
