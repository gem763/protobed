Read more\n\n\u201cManufacturers of fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people, and today we\u2019re taking action to put an end to it,\u201d said Cuomo.\n\nThe governor said New York\u2019s top health official would convene an emergency meeting with the state\u2019s public health council this week, to ban the products.\n\n\u201cNames like, \u2018Bubblegum\u2019, \u2018Cotton Candy\u2019, \u2018Captain Crunch\u2019,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cthese are obviously targeted to young people and highly effective at targeting young people.\u201d\n\nTobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products would not be banned, Cuomo said.\n\nThe governor also said authorities would target stores selling such products to underage persons, warning: \u201cThose retailers are now on notice that we are ramping up enforcement and they will be caught and prosecuted.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration will propose a federal ban on thousands of e-cigarette flavors.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to watch what we\u2019re saying and parents are going to be a lot tougher with respect to their children,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn December last year, the National Institutes of Health said more than 37% of high school seniors reported \u201cany vaping\u201d over the past 12 months, a number that was just under 28% in 2017.\n\n\u201cMore than one in 10 eighth graders (10.9%) say they vaped nicotine in the past year and use is up significantly in virtually all vaping measures among eighth, 10th and 12th graders,\u201d NIH said.\n\nAt least six confirmed deaths have been connected to vaping across the US \u2013 in addition to more than 450 cases of reported lung issues.\n\nRepeatedly calling vaping \u201cdangerous\u201d, Cuomo said: \u201cIt is addicting young people to nicotine at a very early age and nicotine is highly addictive. It doesn\u2019t even matter what product you are using. It is getting young people addicted to nicotine.\u201d\n\nHe said that while vaping was \u201ctechnically\u201d better than smoking, \u201cthe only situation, in my mind, factually, that justifies vaping is if you had a person that said, \u2018I currently smoke, and I have tried every other device to stop smoking. I\u2019ve tried everything. Nothing has worked, except vaping.\u2019\u201d\n\nCuomo said that there had been a debate about whether menthol-flavored e-cigarettes should be banned, and that he and state health commissioner Dr Howard Zucker had discussed the issue.\n\n\u201cDr Zucker feels at this point he is not yet ready to ban menthol,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? There is some data that suggests for menthol cigarette smokers, again who have tried every other device to stop smoking \u2026 the menthol flavor for the vaping helps menthol cigarette smokers.\u201d\n\nIn order for the ban to be implemented, Zucker would make a recommendation to the public health council. If it agrees, there would be a two-week grace period before authorities began stepped up enforcement of retailers.\n\nJuul, the largest company in the e-cigarette market, said it was reviewing Cuomo's announcement \u2013 and agreed there was a need for \u201caggressive category-wide action\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman said the company would \u201cfully comply\u201d with local laws and federal policy.\n\nJuul says it stopped selling flavored products in traditional retail stores in November 2018.", "description": "Governor Andrew Cuomo announces \u2018emergency executive action\u2019 amid a surge in youth vaping", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d4cd2a24a5af8a64504677853b19877330bdda/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d22dfb6fc07ae6e12ad4088e8202ac99", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
