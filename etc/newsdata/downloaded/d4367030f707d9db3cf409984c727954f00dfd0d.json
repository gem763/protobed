I find it impossible to see that it could serve any other rational purpose.\u201d\n\nLord Brodie, the third judge, said that despite the weight that courts need to give to the royal prerogative, and a government\u2019s right to use procedures to suit its purposes, this was an \u201cegregious\u201d case of misuse of prorogation.\n\nHe said: \u201cProcedural manoeuvres are the stuff of politics, whether conducted in parliament or in lesser bodies. However, when the manoeuvre is quite so blatantly designed \u2018to frustrate parliament\u2019 at such a critical juncture in the history of the United Kingdom I consider that the court may legitimately find it to be unlawful.\u201d", "description": "Lord Carloway says No 10 knew prorogation would stymie debate about PM\u2019s Brexit plans", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad61fba36ffb8be62bcc9ca917e3301fbb0bfb59/221_56_1573_944/master/1573.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1dfb1274b93bf63b8a39a5a3f057e7b8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
