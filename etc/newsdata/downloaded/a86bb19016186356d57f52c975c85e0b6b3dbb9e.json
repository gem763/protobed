I'm absolutely against it,\" he told AFP.\n\nAt the national government level, the view is more sanguine.\n\n\"We want to study how to minimise the damage (from a potential discharge) to the region's reputation and Fukushima products,\" an Industry Ministry official said.\n\nThe government is sensitive to fears that people inside Japan and further afield will view any discharge as sending radioactive waste into the sea.\n\nNo decisions are likely in the near-term, with the country sensitive to the international spotlight that will fall on Japan as it hosts the Olympic Games next year.\n\nEnvironmentalists are also resolutely opposed to any discharge into the sea, and Greenpeace argues that TEPCO cannot trusted to properly decontaminate the water.\n\nThe solution, said Greenpeace senior nuclear specialist Shaun Burnie, \"ultimately can only be long-term storage and processing\".", "description": "In the grounds of the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant sits a million-ton headache for the plant's operators and Japan's government: Tank after tank of water contaminated with radioactive elements.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7883/178f550db84c4965b3705254f0c3965c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
