Replacement prop Jefferson Poirot gleefully grabbed the fifty try with the clock ticking down.\n\nFrance led 12-6 at halftime after flyhalf Camille Lopez set up tries inside the opening 25 minutes for wingers Yoann Huget and Raka with kicks into the corners.\n\nBut countless French errors kept the U.S. in contention at the break, with MacGinty landing two first-half penalties from in front of the posts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of this group of players. I really feel we did go toe to toe-toe, we never did give up the fight,\u201d U.S. head coach Gary Gold said. \u201cWhen you play a team of the French caliber, if you make mistakes in crucial areas of the field they will punish you.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s strong reserves bench made the difference in handing the U.S. Eagles their second defeat of the tournament after a 45-7 loss to 2003 champion England.\n\n\u201cWe performed a lot better today than against England. Toward the latter stages of the game the luck went against us,\u201d Gold said. \u201cUp until that stage we were asking questions of them.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s next game is against Tonga on Sunday, while the Eagles take on two-time semifinalist Argentina three days later.\n\nThe French still need to fine-tune their game and, as often is the case, simply don\u2019t do things in a conventional way.\n\nAfter leading 20-3 at halftime in its opening game against Argentina, France needed a late dropped goal to win 23-21.\n\nThis time, the French looked comfortable at 12-3 within the opening 25 minutes but then made a string of mistakes.\n\nFrance needed some leadership and hooker Guilhem Guirado - one of 12 players swapped out after the Argentina game - replaced the ineffective Camille Chat for the second half.\n\nKeen to sharpen up, the French even did a quick coaching drill before the Americans were back out on the field.\n\nBut it made little difference, as twice they conceded turnovers from driving malls near the U.S. line early into the new half.\n\nLes Bleus could not get things going, and even when winger-turned-center Sofiane Guitoune made a brilliant, scything run through midfield before setting up Raka in the right corner, his long and looping pass was judged to have been forward.\n\nStill, France showed it has the ability to step up a gear and - just as play had been sloppy beforehand - the three tries were clinically taken near the end.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Just when France appeared vulnerable against a spirited U.S. lineup, its bench came to the rescue to seal a 33-9 win which kept Les Bleus firmly on track for the knockout stages at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/japan_rugby_wcup_france_usa_28674_c0-174-3153-2012_s1770x1032.jpg?8713110bc54960e46a4caedb7f632d34d85cf7a6"}
