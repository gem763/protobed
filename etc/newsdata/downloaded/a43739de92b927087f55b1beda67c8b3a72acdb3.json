Unfortunately, it just wasn't to be.\n\n\"I guess he hadn't been used to that back home. He ended up feeling a little delicate the next morning.\n\n\"The next morning he wouldn't leave his room. After a number of attempts to talk to him by some of our players, he had already decided he was homesick and wanted to return home to Australia.\n\n\"It's a shame he didn't give it a fair go, let alone train or play for us.\"\n\nThe club have never since brought in an overseas player as young as 17.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Smith broke down in 2018 when admitting to his part in a ball-tampering scandal\n\nSpeaking to the Warrington Guardian, Mr Tyreman said: \"I don't think anyone could have predicted him going on to become Australia captain and arguably the best batsman in the world.\"\n\nSmith - a dual passport holder thanks to his London-born mother Gillian - is currently top-ranked Test cricket batsman in the world and has been instrumental in Australia's successful bid to retain the Ashes in England.\n\nHis imperious form has seen the 30-year-old become the leading run-scorer of the series, despite missing the third Test with a concussion injury.\n\nAs he has frequently been reminded by England fans during the series, his career has not been without controversy. In 2018, Smith was banned from all international and domestic cricket for 12 months for his role in a ball-tampering scandal.", "description": "The Australian hero once signed for a village club in Cheshire, but left after just five days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/142B2/production/_108801628_5c8c06d0-3eae-4d19-aa79-33730772c95c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
