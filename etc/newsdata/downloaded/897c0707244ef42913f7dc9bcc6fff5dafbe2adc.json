Flow on delays continue. pic.twitter.com/IuiYVzbahc \u2014 T1 Sydney Trains (@T1SydneyTrains) October 10, 2019\n\nThat was compounded by a malfunctioning train at Central Station, impacting services into the city from Parramatta, Leppington, Liverpool, Lidcombe, and Bankstown, along with trains between Bondi Junction, Waterfall, and Cronulla.\n\nOutbound trains to Macarthur via Airport or Sydenham have also been hit.\n\nThe mechanical issue has also been fixed, but \u201cflow on delays\u201d from that whole deal are still on the cards.\n\nThe train with mechanical issues has been moved from the platform at Central. Flow on delays will affect services on T4 and wait & journey times will be longer. Please listen to announcements as stopping patterns have changed. pic.twitter.com/cIYd9Vsmvm \u2014 T4 Sydney Trains (@T4SydneyTrains) October 10, 2019\n\nFlow on delays continue.

It's 2019, sort yourself out Sydney Trains \u2014 May Fahmi (@may_fahmi) October 10, 2019\n\nSydney trains cant get any worst.took me an hour to reach Townhall from Carlton???????????????????????? \u2014 Birat Pokharel (@nepalibirat15) October 10, 2019\n\nI swear to fuck, every train I get on is destined to be late. I could catch a train at 6:30am and it would end up being the one that was delayed for two hours the other week. Why do you hate me, Sydney Trains? Whyyyyyy. \u2014 Naomi (@sherlockgnomes9) October 10, 2019\n\nA steadier stream of pedestrians over the Bridge this AM after #sydneytrains passengers at Milsons Point were told it\u2019s taking up to an hour to get to Town Hall, & recommended bus or a \u2018walk over the Sydney Harbour Bridge\u2019 as alternative and faster options. pic.twitter.com/2m9LvWmNOU \u2014 Maarinke (@Emveem) October 10, 2019\n\nWhen you\u2019re conference started at 9am and your train terminates at central so you have to battle thousands of people just getting off the train let alone making further travel plans to walk ????\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #Sydneytrains #SydPos19 pic.twitter.com/wkdHSCLQlb \u2014 Mrs Rowl (@RowlUpToClass) October 10, 2019\n\nI\u2019m used to #sydneytrains ruining my trip home from work but today they are mixing it up and have fucked up my trip TO work pic.twitter.com/mt6G39LBwj \u2014 R I C H I E ????????????\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (@Richie_G81) October 10, 2019\n\nPEDESTRIAN.TV\u2019s own Senior Style Editor Melissa Mason said she waited 45 minutes to travel 5km via train before opting for a bus instead.\n\n\u201cAs soon as one tiny thing goes wrong the entire city goes into meltdown,\u201d Mason said.\n\nStunningly, her full statement on the delays is actually too profane to publish here.\n\nCommuters have been advised to check in with Transport NSW for continuing updates on the drama.\n\nREAD MORE There Is A Literal Sausage Fest Rolling Into Country NSW Next Month", "description": "Signal works at Wynyard and mechanical issues at Central are making life real hard.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/sydney-trains-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
