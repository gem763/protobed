Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry Giuliani associates won't comply with House impeachment inquiry, attorney says MORE as part of the investigation.\n\nThe administration has been increasingly unwilling to cooperate with requests for testimony and documents related to the burgeoning Ukraine scandal.\n\nPelosi issued a statement Tuesday evening describing the letter as \"another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\"\n\n\"Despite the White House\u2019s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,'\" Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe State Department earlier Tuesday directed the administration\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, not to appear before lawmakers to discuss his conversations related to Ukraine. Sondland had agreed to appear voluntarily, and Democrats signaled later Tuesday they plan to subpoena him to compel his participation in a deposition.\n\nTop Democrats have warned that the administration\u2019s failure to comply with their requests could be cited as obstruction in future articles of impeachment.\n\nResponding to that argument, a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday that \u201casserting rights under the Constitution cannot ever properly be framed as obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nThe letter released by the White House on Tuesday evening describes the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d because it has not been authorized by a majority vote by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe White House argued that the lack of a formal vote is a break with precedent set in the impeachment inquiries into former Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonThis is the Clinton impeachment redux on a whole new toxic level Federal judge knocks DOJ stance that sitting president can't be indicted Federal judge rules against Trump in fight to keep tax records from Manhattan prosecutors MORE.\n\nA senior administration official declined to speculate on Tuesday as to whether Trump would cooperate if the House voted to authorize an impeachment inquiry, leaving open the possibility that the standoff would carry on regardless.\n\nPelosi last week rejected that the House faced an obligation to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry. She would not rule out the possibility of holding one down the line, suggesting some Republicans may be nervous about having to take a side on the matter.\n\nThe letter also asserts that the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry have not afforded Trump the basic due process protections mandated by the Constitution, despite Pelosi\u2019s public assertion that the House would treat Trump with fairness.\n\n\u201cTo comply with the Constitution's demands, appropriate procedures would include-at a minimum-the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\n\u201cLikewise, the Committees must provide for the disclosure of all evidence favorable to the President and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry,\u201d he added.\n\nCipollone also took issue with the Democrats not allowing the committees\u2019 Republican ranking members the power to issue subpoenas and accused House Democrats of \u201cthreatening\u201d executive branch witnesses by stating that a failure by witnesses to participate in depositions would be viewed as evidence of obstruction of Congress.\n\nTrump has railed against the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cscam,\u201d denying for weeks that there was anything wrong with his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call and a subsequent whistleblower complaint raising concerns about how the White House tried to hide its contents have formed the basis of Democrats\u2019 investigation.\n\nTuesday\u2019s letter marks the latest salvo in what has been a months-long battle between the Democratic-held House and the White House.\n\nThe administration routinely rejected House Democrats\u2019 requests for documents and testimony related to former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census and other issues.\n\nThe standoffs led to multiple House committees holding Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrFormer George W.
