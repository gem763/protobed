Both he and his predecessor Theresa May have suffered numerous defeats on Brexit legislation this year.\n\nThe UK Labour Party has stated that it would only support a deal if a commitment to a second referendum is attached to the legislation. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which also called the DUP, stated earlier on Wednesday morning that it would not support certain Irish customs procedures outlined in Johnson's deal.\n\nFollowing the breakthrough in Brussels, the DUP said its position remained unchanged.\n\n\"We have been involved in ongoing discussions with the government,\" then earlier statement read. \"As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT. We will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/17/5da84186a310cf3e97a1bc9a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
