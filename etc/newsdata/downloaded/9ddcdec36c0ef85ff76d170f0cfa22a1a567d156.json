It\u2019s happening this weekend, when she returns to host alongside musical guest Coldplay, and she\u2019s come prepared to not only be funny but to take over the whole damn show. Kate McKinnon, however, is not going to go down without a fight: \u201cI think we all know who the king of the castle is around here, right?\u201d No disrespect for McKinnon, but we\u2019d advise not upsetting Stewart.
