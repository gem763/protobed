Fractional trading is the solution, according to Charles Schwab, the big US execution-only broker.\n\nIt plans to offer trading in fractions of popular equities. The investor might, for example, buy one 10th of a share in Amazon (sticker price $1765) for a mere $176. If they feel like splashing out, they could perhaps acquire a half share for $884.\n\nOlder clients may be richer, but they also have a propensity to die soon. Charles Schwab needs to cultivate clients from among millennials who are now in their mid-30s. Sooner or later, some of them will have real money.\n\nA few already do. They own employee shares in big tech companies. But these businesses have contributed to the unaffordability of equities for those outside their gilded realm.
