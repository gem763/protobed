As such, he or she has by law the right\u2014and indeed the responsibility\u2014to make known, through appropriate channels, indications of serious wrongdoing,' the officials wrote.\n\n'That is precisely what this whistleblower did; and we applaud the whistleblower not only for living up to that responsibility but also for using precisely the channels made available by federal law for raising such concerns,' said the security officials, who served Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nA whistle-blower identified by the New York Times to be a CIA officer made a formal complaint after speaking to other government officials about Trump's push to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens as well as pursue a theory of Ukrainian, rather than Russian, interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers.\n\nJames R. Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama, has harshly criticized Trump\n\nJohn Brennan, Former CIA Director, also signed on\n\nThe letter was signed by former Pentagon officials, diplomats, and security experts\n\nTrump attacked the whistle-blower as a 'partisan' and demanded to face his accuser. The Washington Post reported that House Democrats may interview the whistle-blower at an off-site location to protect their identity, amid concerns it could leak.\n\nIn remarks caught on video, Trump said: \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy.' He continued: 'You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,' he said, referencing execution.\n\nThe officials wrote in their letter: 'What's more, being a responsible whistleblower means that, by law, one is protected from certain egregious forms of retaliation. Whatever one's view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower's complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity.'\n\n'Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.'\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a former top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, was asked about protecting the whistle-blower.\n\n'In intelligence, protecting the whistle-blower is absolutely essential so that there is no retribution or anything for speaking truth,' she said.", "description": "A group of 90 security experts defended the whistle-blower in a letter, saying the person deserves protection and had a 'responsibility' to report wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/18/19453214-0-image-a-7_1570554653476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
