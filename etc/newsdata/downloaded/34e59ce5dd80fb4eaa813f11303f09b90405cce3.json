Again, such is the case here. It is not at all suspicious that the Committee would focus an investigation into presidential financial disclosures on the accuracy and sufficiency of the sitting President\u2019s filings. That the Committee began its inquiry at a logical starting point betrays no hidden law-enforcement purpose. ... We detect no inherent constitutional flaw in laws requiring Presidents to publicly disclose certain financial information. And that is enough. Without treading onto any other potentially fertile grounds from which constitutional legislation could flower, we conclude that given the constitutionally permissible options open to Congress in the field of financial disclosure, the challenged subpoena seeks \u201cinformation about a subject on which legislation may be had.\u201d\n\nIn short: \u201cAt bottom, this subpoena is a valid exercise of the legislative oversight authority because it seeks information important to determining the fitness of legislation to address potential problems within the Executive Branch and the electoral system; it does not seek to determine the President\u2019s fitness for office.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe importance of the ruling goes well beyond the immediate issue at hand. The case arose before the House commenced its formal impeachment process. Now that it has, even the dissent (a poorly reasoned opinion \u2014 \u201cThe dissent identifies nothing in the text, structure, or original meaning of Article I or Article II of the Constitution to support such a sweeping rule of legislative paralysis\" \u2014 by a highly controversial Trump nominee who had never before served on the bench) would acknowledge the House could get this sort of information as part of its impeachment inquiry. The dissent\u2019s amateurish opinion, by the way, is a reminder that the poor quality of Trump nominees means they will have limited sway over veteran judges.\n\n\u201cThe ruling is a shot in the arm for committees investigating Trump\u2019s misconduct and a reminder of how many avenues are left to explore,\u201d says former Justice Department spokesman Matt Miller. \u201cThe president might be able to delay complying further through an appeal, but it\u2019s a hopeful sign that the courts will say no to his claims of being above the law.\u201d\n\nThe decision should also serve as a warning to current and former officials who are abiding by Trump\u2019s bogus \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d claims and refusing to appear for testimony. The claim \u2014 advanced, for example, to prevent former White House counsel Donald McGahn from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 fails the straight-face test and in all likelihood will be repudiated by the courts. Witnesses held in contempt for following ridiculous assertions of privilege might find themselves subject to civil contempt fines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaking another step back, the decision is a reminder that the \u201carguments\u201d advanced by the White House counsel (e.g. the temper-tantrum letter refusing cooperation with impeachment proceedings) are not legitimate legal maneuvers. These are intended to pacify the president and give dull-witted right-wing commentators and Fox News hosts talking points. Judging from the polls showing rising support for impeachment, they have been ineffective even as political gimmicks. As a legal strategy, the White House\u2019s frivolous arguments will not carry the day in court. (Justice Department and White House counsel lawyers advancing ludicrous, bad-faith claims should worry about discipline from state bar authorities.)\n\nFormer prosecutor Mimi Rocah concludes, \u201cOnce again, when the meritless arguments this Administration tries to use to cover up the truth are tested in non-partisan courts where facts, law and precedent matter, they lose.\u201d She continues, \u201cAt the end of the day, one of Trump\u2019s legacies will be a body of case law that will check future presidents from abusing power in the way that he has tried.\u201d In the meantime, the decision significantly increases the chances Congress will get its hands on incriminating evidence against Trump.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump's stonewalling fails.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UX7yrSxI2INsAiUzDH89buQ6Gb4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUEJ4ZHMGYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
