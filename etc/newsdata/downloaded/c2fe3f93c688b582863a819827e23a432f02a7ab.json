Trump\u2019s key ally in the upcoming impeachment fight appeared earlier on Fox & Friends, telling an equally unhappy Brian Kilmeade that Trump had a \u201cpre-9/11 mentality\u201d similar to Barack Obama\u2019s, and just like Obama, Trump would end up owning a resurgence of ISIS in the region following this bug-out. Graham wants Trump to reverse himself again and get back to the safe-zone operation that kept the Kurds separated from the border with Turkey:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pre-9/11 mentality that the Middle East is no concern to us,\u201d Graham told Fox News. \u201cI hope President Trump\u2019s right. I hope we can turn the fight against ISIS over to Turkey. I hope that Turkey, when they go into Syria, they won\u2019t slaughter the Kurds\u2026 If [Trump] follows through with this, it\u2019d be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d He claimed that if Trump doesn\u2019t continue with safe zone border patrols, ISIS will fill the void and the fault will lie squarely with the Trump administration. \u201cI would argue for him to go back to the status quo,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe safe zones were working. Patrolling with Turkey and international forces to protect the Kurds and Turkey is the way to go. If we pull out, the Kurds are in a world of hurt and ISIS comes back, and President Trump will own it.\u201d\n\nKilmeade\u2019s comments were even more scathing. \u201cGeneral Rand Paul was pleased,\u201d Kilmeade snarked, although Graham insisted that Paul wasn\u2019t the issue. Shortly after, Kilmeade declared more seriously, \u201cDon\u2019t say you\u2019re a friend of Israel and allow them to be surrounded by Iran, because that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d While Graham tried to interject, Kilmeade added, \u201cYou might as well take out of your speech that you defeated the caliphate \u2014 because it\u2019s coming right back.\u201d\n\nTough stuff on what has been the friendliest venue for Trump short of Hannity in prime time. Graham\u2019s hardly alone on this, either. The Hill collected more responses from Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill, and it\u2019s far from complimentary:\n\nTrump\u2019s decision, seen as enabling Turkey to go after Kurds in Syria, was lambasted by Trump loyalists such as Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third-ranking House GOP leader, and Republicans who have differed with the president on policies, such as Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah). Cheney called the decision a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d and Romney characterized it as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Kurdish allies that would show \u201cAmerica is an unreliable ally.\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), one of Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders in the Senate, said he agrees with the president that the United States should not be the world\u2019s policeman but warned that \u201cabandoning the Kurds\u201d would send a \u201cterrible signal to America\u2019s allies and adversaries\u201d and would be \u201cunconscionable. The broad-based backlash left some in the GOP hoping Trump would reverse himself, something Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Tuesday raised as a possibility. \u201cI understand he\u2019s reconsidering. I do not think we should abandon the Kurds,\u201d he told a reporter for Politico.\n\nEr \u2026 nope:\n\nFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending! https://t.co/Fbcem9i55Z \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nSenate Republicans have \u201cfound their voices\u201d against Trump on this policy, the New York Times reported last night, even if it hasn\u2019t yet crossed over to the impeachment fight:\n\nHe and other Republicans joined Democrats in saying that the move could potentially clear the way for a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters who have helped the United States root out the Islamic State. Mr. Graham also delivered what could be considered the ultimate insult to Mr. Trump: comparing his Syria policy to that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. When it comes to foreign policy, many senators have spent considerable time developing their expertise, making repeated trips to the Middle East and other hot spots and becoming deeply invested in their positions. They feel confident expressing their opinion, even when it is quite contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s. \u201cMany of us have been dealing with this for a decade or two decades, and I think there are a lot of visits to the area and a lot of discussions that stand behind our views on these issues,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who had previously counseled the White House on the necessity of maintaining forces in Syria. \u201cThis is an area where it has been a consistent concern that leaving those places would create bigger problems than staying.\u201d\n\nAnd the damage might go even farther, into Trump\u2019s core constituency:\n\nTruly remarkable that Trump, facing impeachment, decided this was the time to make a FP move calculated to alienate his most stalwart evangelical supporters:https://t.co/Pic3wTN8pk \u2014 Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) October 9, 2019\n\nNeedless to say, this was a strange time for Trump to pick a foreign policy fight with his own party, especially in the chamber that will have to handle articles of impeachment, if the House approves them. This decision alone might not be enough for Republicans to commit electoral hara kiri by going along on removal, but the arbitrary manner in which Trump made this decision and his lack of consultation with his allies on Capitol Hill might leave them less than enthusiastic about his defense, as I note in my column at The Week:\n\nIf anything, Trump chose the wrong theater of war from which to retreat. While America\u2019s strategic interests in Afghanistan are now limited at best, this isn\u2019t the case in Syria, where the U.S. has critical strategic interests, especially in containing Iran. The Kurds in Syria are not just the front line against ISIS, but also our partners in monitoring and frustrating Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite militias in the region. Iran\u2019s partnership with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad presents a considerable threat to Sunni Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, which just suffered a missile attack that originated in Iran. Add to that the existential threat that Iranian hegemony represents to our ally Israel, and it\u2019s easy to see why Trump\u2019s near-whimsical decision rattled Republicans, especially in the Senate. \u2026 This decision alone won\u2019t convince 20 Republicans to cross the aisle on a removal vote, of course. In part, that is because Trump tried this once before, and his impatience in Syria was well known. However, the seemingly capricious manner in which this decision was made and the damage it does to American credibility with needed partners in the fight against radical Islamist terrorism cannot help but raise doubts about Trump\u2019s leadership with the very people Trump needs to help him preserve it.\n\nThis is a moment in which Trump should be shoring up his political alliances, not severing them in pursuit of a highly questionable policy that puts our regional allies under threat and our counterterrorism partners at risk of annihilation.", "description": "\"It'd be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kilmeade-graham.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
