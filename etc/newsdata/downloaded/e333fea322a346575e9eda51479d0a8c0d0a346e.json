It could hurt the presidency.", "language": "en", "text": "Congressional interference into presidential conversations with foreign leaders would violate Article II. According to Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, the inspector general for the intelligence community can forward any whistle-blower complaint to Congress if it involves a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nBut Congress cannot subject the president to the supervision, control or review of a subordinate officer. As the Supreme Court made clear in a 1926 case, all executive branch officials exist to assist the president in the performance of his constitutional duties. An intelligence officer cannot file a whistle-blower complaint against the president, because the president is not a member of the intelligence community; nor does a presidential phone call with a foreign leader qualify as an intelligence operation. The intelligence community works for the president, not the other way around.\n\nUnder the Constitution and long practice, the president alone conducts foreign relations. As Justice George Sutherland wrote for the majority in a 1936 Supreme Court opinion (quoting Chief Justice John Marshall), the president \u201cis the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["John Yoo", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Ukraine-Trump.Html"], "top_image": ""}
