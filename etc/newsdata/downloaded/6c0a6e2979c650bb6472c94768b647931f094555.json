Peter Florence, chair of this year\u2019s judges, announced to a shocked audience, \u201cWe found that there were two novels that we desperately wanted to win this year\u2019s prize.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is the second Booker win for Atwood, a 79-year-old Canadian writer who won in 2000 for \u201cThe Blind Assassin.\u201d In the prize\u2019s 50-year history, she is only the fourth author to have won twice, but over the years, several of her novels, including \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (1985), have been shortlisted.\n\nAD\n\nEvaristo, a 60-year-old Anglo-Nigerian writer who lives in London, is the first black woman to win the prize since it began in 1969.\n\nComing to the stage with Evaristo to accept her half of the prize, Atwood said: \u201cNeither of us expected to win this. I\u2019m very surprised. I would have thought that I was too elderly. And I kind of don\u2019t need the attention, so I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re getting some. That makes me happy. It would have been quite embarrassing for me, as a good Canadian, if I had been alone here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAtwood and Evaristo\u2019s shared win of the Booker Prize comes just a week after Peter Handke and Olga Tokarczuk both won separate Nobel Prizes in literature.\n\nAtwood, the author of dozens of books \u2014 including novels in a variety of genres, works of nonfiction, children\u2019s books and collections of short stories and poetry \u2014 is one of the most prominent writers in the world and is rumored to be a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature. Aside from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d considered one of the greatest dystopian novels of the modern era, her best-known books include \u201cCat\u2019s Eye\u201d (1988), \u201cAlias Grace\u201d (1996) and the MaddAddam Trilogy (2003-2013), a work of speculative fiction about the dangers of environmental destruction and genetic experimentation.\n\nAD\n\nOddsmakers in Britain, who follow the literary prize intensely, had predicted Atwood would win the Booker this year. Among her competitors was former Booker-winner Salman Rushdie and the Turkish-British writer Elif Shafak. The Booker Prize \u2014 worth about $63,000 \u2014 recognizes the best novel written in English and published in the U.K. and Ireland.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s top literary awards, the Booker has a reputation for dramatically boosting the winner\u2019s sales, but \u201cThe Testaments\u201d has already been a runaway bestseller since it was published on Sept. 10. In the United States, Penguin Random House said that \u201cThe Testaments\u201d sold more than 125,000 copies in its first week, with the best opening day sales of any book in 2019.\n\n\u201cGirl, Woman, Other,\u201d Evaristo\u2019s eighth work of fiction, will be published in the United States on Dec. 3. Evaristo has also published essays and written for BBC radio. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d follows 12 characters, most of them black, in modern Britain. Writing in the New Statesman, one critic said Evaristo is the novelist to read \u201cif you want to understand modern-day Britain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nReflecting on the paucity of minority characters in fiction, Evaristo wrote last week in the Guardian: \u201cWhat, then, does it mean to not see yourself reflected in your nation\u2019s stories? This has been the ongoing debate of my professional career as a writer stretching back nearly 40 years, and we black British women know, that if we don\u2019t write ourselves into literature, no one else will.\u201d\n\nAtwood, an indefatigable writer with nearly 2 million Twitter followers, has been conducting a whirlwind book tour for packed audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. She paused only briefly when her longtime partner, the novelist Graeme Gibson, died on Sept. 18.\n\nFor decades, Atwood resisted writing a sequel to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d her classic feminist dystopia about a country called Gilead in which fertile women are enslaved to produce children. But the election of Donald Trump revived fears about the possible loss of reproductive freedom, which pushed the novel back onto the U.S. bestseller list. And then the award-winning Hulu TV adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss brought the story to millions more. Beset by questions about what happened next in the totalitarian society she\u2019d created, Atwood finally relented and began work on a novel that, as she tweeted, was inspired by \u201ceverything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Testaments\u201d is a far more hopeful and witty novel than \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d It opens 15 years after the close of the previous novel, which ends without revealing what will happen to the narrator, a rebellious handmaid named Offred. The sequel employs three narrators, most notably, Aunt Lydia, a matriarchal tyrant who trains women to be obedient and passive handmaids. As we follow her secret journal entries, we learn how the society of Gilead was constructed \u2014 and how she plans to bring it down.\n\nAlthough the Booker Prize is meant to recognize the supreme quality of a single novel, today\u2019s win for Atwood is surely more of a lifetime achievement award. Although \u201cThe Testaments\u201d is an exciting thriller that wraps up many questions for fans of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d it is not a particularly impressive work of literature on its own. But Gilead has seeped into our political consciousness as deeply as the horrors envisioned by George Orwell in \u201c1984.\u201d Protesters around the world now dress as red-cloaked handmaids, most notably at the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Brett M. Kavanaugh earlier this year. So few novels achieve that level of cultural power that it seems appropriate for the Booker judges to recognize the sequel to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\nFor 18 years, the Booker Prize was sponsored by Man Group, a U.K. financial services firm, and called the Man Booker Prize. Earlier this year, the Crankstart charitable foundation took over funding of the prize and its name was again shorted to the Booker Prize. The winner of the prize is chosen by a panel of five judges, which this year included Peter Florence (chair), Afua Hirsch, Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo and Joanna MacGregor.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nAD", "description": "Unable to decide on a single winner, the judges insist on breaking the rules.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/er5tW7OYBkxn2V5Gxr7Kd-7b7aA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YHRZX6HOZAI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
