The episode raises serious questions about Mexico\u2019s role as a partner in the U.S. government\u2019s fight against cartels.\n\nThis week, gunmen from Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) ambushed and murdered 13 police officers in a show of force with armored vehicles, rocket-propelled grenades, .50 caliber rifles, and other weapons.\n\nThe violence comes at a time when AMLO has reassigned most of the country\u2019s Marines to coastal cities\u2013away from violent cartel hotspots. For years, the Mexican Marines earned a reputation as a trustworthy fighting force in a country where large parts of the security apparatus and politicians serve crime lords, according to recent testimony from the trial of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman.\n\nThe withdrawal of military forces in addition to AMLO\u2019s rhetoric about not fighting cartel \u201cviolence with violence\u201d came to a turning point Thursday afternoon when federal forces captured and later released Ovidio \u201cEl Raton\u201d Guzman Lopez, one of El Chapo\u2019s 10 sons. Friday, AMLO revealed that his security staff made the decision to release Guzman to preserve the peace after the Sinaloa Cartel deployed hundreds of gunmen to terrorize Culiacan. Regardless, the violence proceeded for hours after the heir\u2019s release.\n\n#M\u00e1s: Otro video de los hombres armados que participan en las balaceras en #Culiac\u00e1n. pic.twitter.com/UNDnnYR0yX \u2014 Carlos Z\u00fa\u00f1iga P\u00e9rez (@Carloszup) October 17, 2019\n\nThe combat experienced in Culiacan is not new. For years, cartels operating in border cities near Texas have morphed into paramilitary forces capable of outgunning authorities. The access to firepower, artillery, and explosives pushes the criminal organizations beyond mere drug smugglers into factions capable of performing terror tactics like seen in Middle Eastern war zones.\n\nDuring his Friday press conference, AMLO said his government was focused on fighting for social justice and improving the country\u2019s living conditions in the face of the narco threat. The president previously said he would report criminals to their mothers for spankings and even encouraged civilians to yell \u201cFuchi Guacala\u201d (yuck!) at the sight of gunmen to shame them into improved behavior.\n\nSe\u00f1or Presidente, Mexico esta en llamas.\n\n\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
