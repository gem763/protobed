Her first chance went poorly, but hopefully she\u2019ll get another one and be part of a growing weight class.\n\nThe UFC could do a better job expanding, too, by signing more fighters at 145 pounds. The few others who are on the UFC roster such as Felicia Spencer might be a little much for Fairn right now, but perhaps they could ink someone who would give her a competitive fight.", "description": "See whom Robert Whittaker should fight next after losing the middleweight title to Israel Adesanya at UFC 243.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/israel-adesanya-robert-whittaker-ufc-243-17.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
