Kamala Harris (D-CA) wants Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump\u2019s account.\n\nHarris argues the president is breaking Twitter\u2019s community guidelines by using his account to \u201ctarget, harass, and attempt to out\u201d the whistleblower who alleged Trump has solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nOn Monday, Harris tweeted that Twitter (TWTR) should suspend Trump\u2019s account, and she followed up with a formal request on Tuesday. In a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, released Wednesday morning, Harris pointed to Trump\u2019s recent tweets about the whistleblower.\n\nSounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn\u2019t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\n\u201cThese tweets should also be placed in the proper context, where the president has compared the whistleblower to a \u201cspy\u201d who may have committed treason, and further implied that the punishment for that should be death,\u201d Harris said in the letter.\n\nHarris also highlighted Trump\u2019s tweets attacking House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and suggesting an impeachment could lead to a civil war. In recent days, Trump has used Twitter to call the impeachment process \u201ca COUP,\u201d and mused about having Schiff arrested for treason.\n\n\u201cThese are blatant threats. We need a civil society, not a civil war,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cThese tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety, all while making blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger.\u201d\n\nTwitter Letter by Kensey on Scribd\n\nHarris went on to argue that Twitter has suspended other accounts for \u201cfar less offensive\u201d behavior.\n\n\u201c...when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing. No user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter\u2019s user agreement, not even the President of the United States,\u201d said Harris.\n\nTwitter told Yahoo Finance it has received the letter and intends to respond.\n\nEarlier this year, Twitter changed its policy for tweets from public figures. The company announced in June that it would label and hide tweets from public figures that break its rules.\n\nThe White House defended President Trump\u2019s Twitter use in a statement to Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Kamala Harris, someone who believes in bigger government and more regulation, would like to silence her political opponents. In fact, it\u2019s rather authoritarian of her,\u201d said White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s use of technology to communicate directly with the American people and share his Administration\u2019s unprecedented accomplishments should be praised, not criticized.\u201d\n\nJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
