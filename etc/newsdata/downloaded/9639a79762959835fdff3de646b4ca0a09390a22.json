Everyone may experience health effects, significant increase in respiratory problems.\"\n\nThe deterioration continued due to change in wind direction to northwesterly, local emissions from effigy-burning during Dusshera and falling mercury, apart from stubble burning.\n\nCPCB recently wrote to state pollution control boards and other government agencies on, asking them to take appropriate measures to control dust and pollution.\n\nAFP/ FILE\n\nIn letters sent to the municipal bodies in Delhi and NCR states as well as other agencies, CPCB asked for weekly action taken reports to be submitted and called for precautions to be taken during construction activities, particularly with dust, waste and open burning.\n\nForecasting agency SAFAR said low wind speeds were trapping pollutants and warned a further dip in air quality in the coming days.\n\nA SAFAR bulletin said, \u201cThe southwest monsoon has started to retreat now. Wind speeds continue to be slow and variable with predominant direction from the west. Under these conditions, air quality is predicted to deteriorate further. Indications of increased fire activity during the last 48 hours are visible from satellite imagery and a further deterioration of AQI is expected for the next two days.\u201d", "description": "While the national capital enjoyed relatively cleaner air for three months, the air quality has now dipped to \u2018poor\u2019 last week, continuing this week as well.
