In the previous session, prices fell to their lowest\n\nsince Aug. 13 at $1,483.90.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCv1 were up 0.2% at $1,502.2 an ounce.\n\n\"The ECB is expected to reduce further the interest rate\n\ninto negative territory... The meeting could serve as a\n\npotential catalyst (for gold) and investors are already buying\n\ninto the rate cut expectations,\" said Margaret Yang Yan, a\n\nmarket analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nGiven that gold has had such a deep correction from its\n\nrecent peak, investors are buying on dips, Yan added.\n\nBullion prices have shed more than 4%, or over $60, since\n\nscaling an over six-year peak of $1,557 on Sept. 4.\n\nRisk sentiment got a lift ahead of monetary policy decisions\n\nby the ECB on Thursday and the U.S. Federal Reserve next week,\n\nwith investors hoping for further easing amid a slowdown in\n\nglobal growth.\n\nMarket participants might be reluctant to commit to big\n\nrisk-on bets, which could nudge gold upwards amid\n\npre-positioning ahead of Thursday's event, said Ilya Spivak,\n\nsenior currency strategist, DailyFx.\n\nECB policymakers are leaning toward a package that includes\n\na rate cut, a pledge to keep rates low for longer and\n\ncompensation for banks over the side-effects of negative rates,\n\nfive sources familiar with the discussion said last week.\n\nFundamental backdrop is still broadly gold-supportive\n\nconsidering the main sources of risk aversion remain unresolved,\n\nSpivak added.\n\n\"Both Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war are ongoing\n\nconcerns, as is the broader slowdown in global growth ... That\n\nprobably encourages central banks to remain dovish.\"\n\nGold prices gained about 18%, or over $200, since hitting\n\nyear's low of $1,265.85 on May 2.\n\nOn the trade front, a senior White House adviser tamped down\n\nexpectations on Tuesday for the next rounds of U.S.-China trade\n\ntalks, urging investors, businesses and the public to be patient\n\nabout resolving the trade dispute. Spot gold still targets $1,453, as it has cleared a support\n\nat $1,497 per ounce, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang\n\nTao. Meanwhile, the dollar index was steady , while Asian\n\nstock markets held firm and bond yields rose on Wednesday.\n\nUSD/ MKTS/GLOB\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver rose 0.5% to\n\n$18.09 per ounce, having hit a two-week low of $17.75 in the\n\nprevious session.\n\nPalladium XPD= was trading flat at $1,560.96 per ounce,\n\nwhile platinum XPT= gained 0.7% to $936.90.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold prices snap 4-day losing streak; focus on ECB meet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/gbp_usd_3_800x533_L_1411987810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
