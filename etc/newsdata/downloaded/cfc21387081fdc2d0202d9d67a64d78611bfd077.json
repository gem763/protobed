Food shortages. Rising sea levels. More extreme weather events like Hurricane Dorian,\u201d said CNN host Wolf Blitzer at the town hall.\n\nCNN is hardly an outlier. The Columbia Journalism Review announced last week that more than 170 U.S. and international news outlets had signed onto Covering Climate Now, a project launched in April by CJR and the leftist magazine The Nation \u201caimed at strengthening the media\u2019s focus on the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the list leans heavily toward left-wing organs like Democracy Now and Mother Jones, but also includes news sites such as CBS News, PBS NewsHour, a host of local television stations, and regional newspapers like the Colorado Springs Gazette and Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nThose joining the initiative agreed to run \u201ca week\u2019s worth of climate coverage in the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on Sept. 23,\u201d according to CJR.\n\nPlacing more emphasis on climate reporting is one thing, but by embracing the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d label pushed by global-warming activists, critics worry that the media outlets have taken sides on a complex, contentious issue, abandoning any pretense of balanced or neutral coverage.\n\nThese are the 10 presidential candidates who are participating in CNN\u2019s #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/XJlS0IDXwp pic.twitter.com/JF7T8uBvJG \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 4, 2019\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Columbia Journalism Review has joined forces with far-leftist publications The Guardian and The Nation to propagandize a phony climate panic tells you all you need to know about the sad and hopelessly biased state of legacy media outlets today,\u201d said Jim Lakely, spokesman for the free-market Heartland Institute.\n\nKelly McBride, senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, defended the project as well as the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d tag, saying that \u201ca majority of scientists would say it\u2019s a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of journalists have shifted from viewing the climate issue as one that is disputed to one that is affecting different communities in different ways,\u201d she said. \u201cSo rather than reporting on whether climate change is happening, they are reporting on the actual impact.\u201d\n\nAll reputable climate scientists, even those dismissed as \u201cdeniers,\u201d believe that the rise in atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels, driven by human-caused emissions, has had an impact on the earth\u2019s climate, but that\u2019s a far cry from declaring the planet is in crisis.\n\nRoy Spencer, a University of Alabama in Huntsville climate scientist formerly with NASA, called the \u201ccrisis\u201d label a \u201cgross exaggeration.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo use a term like \u2018crisis\u2019 when discussing climate change is a gross exaggeration, especially for journalists,\u201d said Mr. Spencer, author of \u201cInevitable Disaster: Why Hurricanes Can\u2019t Be Blamed on Global Warming.\u201d \u201cThere is no aspect of climate change which is of \u2018crisis\u2019 proportions.\u201d\n\nWorld is burning: CJR\n\nThat\u2019s not the impression conveyed by CJR\u2019s Covering Climate Now, aimed at \u201creframing the way journalists cover climate change\u201d at a time when \u201ccivilization is accelerating toward disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media are complacent while the world burns,\u201d declared CJR in an April 22 headline accompanied by a wildfire photo.\n\nThen again, NASA found that the area burned by global wildfires dropped by 25 percent from 2003-19, raising the question: What happens to stories that run counter to the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d narrative, already underreported by mainstream media outlets?\n\nClimate skeptic Marc Morano, who runs many of those stories on his Climate Depot website, called the journalism initiative \u201ctotally unnecessary,\u201d given that the media are \u201calready doing the most crappy reporting they could possibly do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis latest attempt basically says, \u2018Keep up more of the same crappy reporting,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Morano. \u201cNo dissent. No debate. Let\u2019s promote the UN line, let\u2019s promote the UN claims, let\u2019s promote the idea that the government can control the climate.\u201d\n\nTim Graham, vice president for media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center, accused the news industry of attempting to snuff debate on climate science and policy.\n\n\u201cThe media elites are not only goaded by the Left to see climate change as the overriding story of our lives, but they are goaded to make sure democracy dies in darkness,\u201d said Mr. Graham.\n\nCJR\u2019s Emily Tamkin actually discouraged CNN from lapsing back into what she called a \u201cboth sides\u201d approach to the climate story, saying \u201cthe moderators should operate on the assumption that the climate is in crisis and that this needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nCovering Climate Now comes after years of environmental groups urging media outlets to devote more coverage to climate change, a campaign that drew headlines after MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes tweeted in July 2018 that climate was \u201ca palpable ratings killer.\u201d\n\nLiberal foundations have been eager to fund climate journalism. The CJR initiative reported receiving $1 million from Bill Moyers, president of the left-tilting Schumann Media Center, which also funds The Nation Institute and Democracy Now, according to InfluenceWatch.\n\nThe Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which publishes CJR, has come under scrutiny in recent years for its Energy and Environmental Reporting Project, which is funded in part by Democratic megadonor George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and several Rockefeller charities, known for their climate advocacy.\n\nThe industry group Energy in Depth accused Columbia of \u201cpaid-for journalism\u201d over the project\u2019s 2017 article in the Los Angeles Times blaming the Exxon Valdez spill on climate change. Two years earlier, an \u201cExxon Knew\u201d article failed to disclose the project\u2019s funders, which the Times later added.\n\nThe Times said that the reporting was not influenced by its funders, although Rockefeller Family Fund president Lew Wasserman said in 2016 that \u201cwe paid a team of independent reporters\u201d from Columbia \u201cto try to determine what Exxon and other US oil companies had really known about climate science, and when.\u201d\n\nClimate reporting has done well in the Columbia-hosted Pulitzer Prize competition. InsideClimate News was a 2016 Pulitzer finalist for its \u201cExxon Knew\u201d series, while Amity and Prosperity, an anti-fracking book by Eliza Griswold, won a Pulitzer for non-fiction in 2019.\n\nMs. Griswold is married to Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia journalism graduate school and Pulitzer board member, who authored the 2012 book Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power. The Pulitzer administrator said Mr. Coll recused himself from the voting in all book categories.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
