Waititi wasn't able to get anyone interested and also thought a casting like that would backfire.\n\nRead more: Kevin Smith on life after the heart attack, reconciling with Ben Affleck, and how \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" became his most emotional movie in years\n\n\"If it's the Brad Pitt Hitler movie that's all it's going to be known as,\" Waititi told Business Insider. \"He'll be the only thing on the poster and it will distract from the real heart of that story which are these kids. And I want to see a Brad Pitt anything movie but it would have taken away from what the story is trying to deliver.\"\n\nThen after Waititi made \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" Fox Searchlight became interested in making the movie, but only if he played the imaginary Hitler character.\n\n\"Which was lunacy to me,\" Waititi admitted.\n\nBut he warmed to the idea when he heard Searchlight's reasoning, which was that the only person who could pull off the buffoonery of the role was the person who wrote the story.\n\nThat led to the uncomfortable reality for Waititi on set, as he would sometimes have to direct dressed in his Hitler costume.\n\n\"Yeah, it was horrible,\" Waititi said, adding that he did address the cast and crew on the first day of shooting about his appearance.\n\nThough he tried to conceal it at times, he said it was still terrible to be dressed like that all the time.\n\n\"I was just embarrassed on set,\" Waititi said. \"Having to be dressed like that and having to talk to people. Often I took off the mustache between set ups or put a hat on. Or I would take the jacket off. But still, you catch yourself in a reflection and you're reminded. For most people it's something like seeing themselves and going, 'I forgot, I got a haircut yesterday.' For me it was, 'Ah, I forgot, I look like Hitler.'\"", "description": "\"Jojo Rabbit\" writer-director Taika Waititi also plays an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler in the movie.
