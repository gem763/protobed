That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s claim that she was dismissed after her first year of teaching because she was pregnant has become a cornerstone of her stump speeches.", "description": "", "authors": ["Freebeacon.Com Politics County-Records-Contradict-Warrens-Claim-She-Was-Fired-Over-Pregnancy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
