It\u2019s a simple, well-considered, uncomplicated glimpse into what a tablet computer ought to be. \u201cGet on the train,\u201d it says, \u201cthis is the future.\u201d\n\nGoogle probably would never admit it, but putting its own hardware team in charge of this year\u2019s Android tablet makes a statement: everybody else has been doing it wrong. That doesn\u2019t just include Android tablets like the Nexus 9 or Samsung\u2019s Tab series, but also Apple\u2019s iPad Pro and even Microsoft\u2019s Surface line. The iPad Pro is massive with a gangly keyboard and all the limitations of mobile software, and the Microsoft Surface has only recently begun to resolve its fundamental identity crisis between laptop and tablet. They\u2019re good, but they're over-engineered solutions to problems we\u2019re only beginning to have.\n\nGoogle is the latest company to try to rethink how we interact with computers, designing and manufacturing a tablet and keyboard combination itself for the very first time instead of leaning on a partner to do it. The result is the Pixel C, a beautiful Android tablet that\u2019s just slightly bigger than the iPad Air 2.\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nLet\u2019s start with the hardware, and I won\u2019t make any bones about it: I love it in all its squarish simplicity. The Pixel C is slightly bigger than the iPad Air 2 in every dimension (including weight), but not so much that it should give anybody significant pause. Even though both tablets share the same basic materials \u2014 glass and aluminum \u2014 they look and feel totally distinct. The Pixel C has straight, squared off edges \u2014 you can trace the design language straight back to the Chromebook Pixel. But it isn\u2019t a slavish port from laptop to tablet. It\u2019s designed with slightly curved edges and dual speakers. There are no creaks or weird misaligned ports and buttons like we often see on Android tablets. Google\u2019s Pixel team has only ever made beautiful-looking hardware, and the Pixel C is no exception. It fits the Pixel design aesthetic perfectly The 10.2-inch screen is beautiful too, at a resolution of 2560 x 1800 in a screen with an uncommon aspect ratio: 1:\u221a2. That\u2019s the same ratio as a standard A4 piece of paper, which means that the Pixel C\u2019s screen feels capacious whether you\u2019re using it in landscape or portrait mode (it also has implications for multitasking, maybe, someday \u2014 more on that later). Like those Chromebook Pixel laptops, paying for the design and materials of the Pixel C isn\u2019t cheap. It starts at $499 for the 32GB version, and it\u2019s another $149 for the Bluetooth keyboard that\u2019s meant to go along with it. From a certain perspective, that may not seem like too much \u2014 an iPad Air 2 with only 16GB of storage costs $499 as well. But Android tablets typically don\u2019t cost this much. The battery is good enough \u2014 which doubtlessly accounts for some of the 0.27-inch thickness \u2014 and so this tablet just lasts and lasts. In our battery test of refreshing web pages, it topped out over 11 hours. In real-world use I never plugged in the USB Type-C charger until the next morning, even after using it all day. The specs are also huge: 3GB of RAM paired to the latest Nvidia X1 64-bit processor. That all seems good, but something is amiss with performance on the Pixel C. There are inexcusable pauses and latency, especially when launching and switching apps. My hunch is that the Android team still hasn\u2019t figured out how to take real advantage of all that power out of Nvidia\u2019s silicon (the Nexus 9 seemed to similarly underutilize its processor). Whatever the reason, it\u2019s a miss. A bad one.\n\nHardware that looks good is easy to come by. But what\u2019s genuinely new and interesting about the Pixel C is the optional Bluetooth keyboard accessory. It\u2019s a $149 gadget that is more gadgety than any mainstream piece of consumer hardware I\u2019ve used in years. It attaches to the tablet with magnets, closing it up into a sealed little flat box in a mode that Google calls \"sunny side down.\" When closed, the tablet wirelessly charges the keyboard. You can attach the keyboard to the back with more magnets \u2014 that\u2019s \"sunny side up.\" But what you want to do with a keyboard is type, and there again you have yet more \u2014 and more powerful \u2014 magnets. It takes a minute to figure out, but it works well There\u2019s a small hinge at the top of the keyboard that latches on to the back of the Pixel C, letting you pull it up to any angle you might want \u2014 and it sticks there too, because that hinge is as sturdy as it can be without being obstinate. The Pixel C automatically detects whether the keyboard is attached and knows whether or not to show you the on-screen keyboard. The system is clever. Actually, it\u2019s too clever by half. The Pixel C came with a cheeky little how-to card that explains how it works and, well, it needed it. I\u2019ve watched no fewer than five Very Smart People who hadn\u2019t seen it before struggle to figure out how to work the thing. Does it open like a laptop? Nope, you slide it out. Do you set the tablet on top of the keyboard to make the hinge pop up? Nope, you have to lay it flat or slap the two things together in the right position. Once you get it, there is something kind of satisfying in that gadgety way of slipping the two things apart and reattaching them (but take note, it only works in landscape mode). When they\u2019re together, you get a little laptoppy-looking thing that\u2019s sturdy and won\u2019t come apart or flop around at all. Surface and iPad Pro: take note. But because this is a 10-inch tablet, there\u2019s not enough horizontal space to fit a full-sized keyboard. The Pixel team\u2019s solution was to excise less-used keys like brackets and the tilde, which means that the keys you use most get to be bigger. Like any diminutive keyboard, it takes a minute to get used to. But once you do, you can really fly. The key travel is plenty deep and there\u2019s a little three-dot menu you can hit to bring up a symbol keyboard on the screen. (Google also tells me that there are hidden, secret keyboard combos for some symbols, only a few of which I\u2019ve discovered). You can definitely get used to this keyboard and even learn to love it \u2014 I did. Except, well, something is amiss again: missed and repeating keypresses. The Pixel C seems to just have a stutter-step in the Bluetooth connection from time to time. When it drops, nothing registers for a few seconds. When it returns: fffffffffffffffffffffff (literally and figuratively).\n\nBad Bluetooth connections and rogue latency are the sort of thing that could be improved with a minor OS update \u2014 or so I\u2019d like to hope. But Android doesn\u2019t need a minor OS update to get up to snuff on tablets, it needs a major one. And that update needs to be combined with an all-out campaign to woo developers to update their apps to truly support tablets. Android needs serious work on tablets One big problem is that most of the apps I use on Android tablets still aren\u2019t truly optimized for tablets. Most apps are comprised of wide, wasted expanses of open space that are technically designed for any screen size but actually aren\u2019t utilizing all this screen real estate. That\u2019s problematic with third-party apps, but it\u2019s unforgivable from Google\u2019s own apps. Hangouts, the perennial forgotten child of Mountain View, is a mess on this device. Even Google Docs (presumably the app best suited to this keyboard) feels more like a phone app than something I can do real work in. It gets worse with third-party apps. The Pixel C wants to be used in landscape mode, but too many apps assume that they\u2019re on phones. Popular apps like Slack, Twitter, and many more toss you into portrait mode even when the keyboard is attached. Complaining that Android is lacking tablet apps is old hat, but that\u2019s not even the biggest problem here. No, it\u2019s that Android and the Pixel C have a hair-on-fire screaming need for some kind of split-screen solution. Microsoft, Samsung, and Apple have all figured this out, but there\u2019s not any kind of solution inside Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Heck, the \u221a2 aspect ratio of the Pixel C\u2019s screen is basically designed to be split in half, yet there\u2019s no option to do so here.", "description": "A funny thing happened on the way to inventing the future of touchscreen computing: everybody is botching it.\r\n\r\nGoogle is the latest company to try to rethink how we interact with computers,...", "authors": ["Dieter Bohn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XpBIZSeIA6HBSO1Zb8gK-ygVAJ0=/0x204:2039x1351/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47826081/Google-Pixel_C-review-1.0.0.jpg", "published_at": "2015-12-08"}
