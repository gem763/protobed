It is a must-read for every parent with a child in an American public school, or who one day will be in an American public school.\n\nThe book, titled Why Meadow Died, is a meticulous and methodical dissection of what led up to the February 14, 2018 mass slaughter that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) in Parkland, Florida. And here\u2019s a sneak peek: It doesn\u2019t focus on the gun that the left would have you believe is the Devil at the heart of the story. In fact, guns barely factor into the story.\n\nIt is very facile for the left to blame \u201cguns\u201d for what happened on February 14, 2018 in Parkland, because it deflects attention from the left\u2019s own profound policy failures, which were the real culprit in this saga. Rather than looking at superficial claims about \u201ceasy access to guns,\u201d the authors take a much deeper and more nuanced look at where the real Devil resides in this tale. And not that shockingly, for those of us (including myself) who have been researching this atrocity since that terrible day, the Devil lies primarily in government policies, and more particularly, in political correctness as reflected in government policy.\n\nThe authors of this book, Max Eden and Andrew Pollack, could not have been a better team to conduct this examination.\n\nMax is a Yale-trained education policy expert, who brings a wealth of education policy expertise to the table and years of study surrounding the issues which so profoundly impacted our nation that horrible day.\n\nAndy is the father of Meadow Pollack, a remarkable young lady who was a student at MSD. She was caught in Nikolas Cruz\u2019s gunsights on Valentine\u2019s Day 2018. Meadow found no route of escape, as hard as she tried, and lost her life while using her own body trying to protect that of another student.\n\nBoth Max and Andy deserve the gratitude of our nation in conducting the research that has led to this enormously important work.\n\nWhy Meadow Died documents one of the most preventable, horrific, maddening, and yet predictable calamities that one could imagine. And if you think that your kid\u2019s public school is special - is somehow immune from what happened in Parkland - you really need to read this book. The policies set forth from the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Education on down to the Broward County Public Schools system, to the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Department, were unbelievable. And I mean that in the purest sense of the term. I could not believe after reading all the details of Nikolas Cruz\u2019s pathetic life that he was not: a) incarcerated long before he had a chance to kill MSD students; or b) institutionalized in a mental hospital for psychotic individuals.\n\nThe detailed description of Nikolas Cruz\u2019s outrageous conduct, particularly while a student in Westglades Middle School (found in Chapter 5) is breathtaking. Were I the parent of a child in this school and made aware of the truly terrifying behaviors that such a student as Cruz exhibited, yet from which he suffered little to no consequence under Broward\u2019s profoundly misguided policies, I would be outraged and demanding that education bureaucrats\u2019 heads roll. I would not let my child back in the school.\n\nMessrs. Eden and Pollack expose a system whereby feel-good policies going by such pleasant-sounding names as \u201cRestorative Justice\u201d, \u201cPositive Behavioral Intervention and Supports\u201d, and \u201cMulti-Tiered System of Supports\u201d in reality mask a system designed to go to nearly any lengths to protect violent, disturbed, psychotic and just plain evil students at the expense of the vast majority of good kids.\n\nThe principal goal of these programs is to avoid having kids arrested and removed from mainstream public schools, as this was believed by the Obama administration to feed the so-called \u201cschool to prison pipeline\u201d, which they felt unfairly affected blacks and other minorities. Much of the problem stemmed from the Obama administration\u2019s racialist mindset. Since the largest proportion of kids being arrested in schools were people of color, the Obama administration reasoned, this was evidence of \u201cimplicit bias\u201d on the part of racist teachers who were targeting minority kids, rather than the fact that on a per capita basis, arrestable offenses were being committed by minority kids at a far higher rate than by non-minority kids.\n\nRobert Runcie, the Broward Schools superintendent, launched something called the PROMISE program, which was sort of the mothership of twisted education policies, designed to keep violent kids from being arrested. Runcie had been the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Obama administration\u2019s Education Secretary, Arnie Duncan, before Runcie was appointed to head the Broward school system, in which MSD is located. The PROMISE program in Broward then became a model promoted by the Obama administration through their infamous 2014 \u201cDear Colleague Letter\u201d on school discipline, that was issued to public school district officials across the nation. It threatened loss of federal funding if school districts didn't adopt similarly lenient policies.\n\nThe Obama administration engineered the installation of Runcie as Broward Schools\u2019 superintendent. Before joining the Broward school system, Runcie had served under Arne Duncan in the Chicago Public Schools as the Chief Information Officer. That\u2019s right. Runcie was not trained as an educator, but was Chicago schools\u2019 top IT guy. In other words, he was an Obama administration plant, willing to implement its new \u201cinclusive\u201d education policy scheme across the nation, starting in Broward. This was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nLast year, I wrote a column in which I laid much of this out, but there was a fundamental flaw in the very title of my column, which was \u201cThe Cascading Failures of Government.\u201d As Mr. Pollack eloquently states in Chapter 4: \u201cSome people have said that the Parkland tragedy was a \u2018total system failure\u2019\u2026 But when you take a deeper dive into the school district and its politically correct policies in Part III, every failure will make sense\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure you could call what happened a \u2018failure\u2019 because everyone was doing exactly what these policies and this system encouraged them to do. Nikolas Cruz could not possibly have broadcast more clearly who and what he was.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: These same sorts of policies that produced the mass killer Cruz, who was a flashing red beacon, are being implemented in public school districts across the nation. We are reducing our schools to the lowest common denominator, and it\u2019s just a matter of time before another Nikolas Cruz comes along.\n\nAndy Pollack has carried on Meadow\u2019s life through his courage and tireless efforts to expose the true cause of the disaster which took Meadow from her family. He and Max have done her proud. Their efforts resulted in a tour de force expose of government failure, which portends disaster for America\u2019s public schools. I truly think that Meadow knows exactly what labors her Dad has expended to reveal the truth behind the Parkland atrocity, and that she is immensely proud of him.\n\nWilliam F.
