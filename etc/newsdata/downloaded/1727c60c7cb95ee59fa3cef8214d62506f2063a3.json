But federal prosecutors said they were declining to prosecute Cognizant under a leniency program for corporate Foreign Corrupt Practices Act offenders, since the company had self-reported the alleged scheme and had a strong, pre-existing compliance program, among other factors.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Thiruvengadam declined to comment.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMr. Thiruvengadam\u2019s settlement didn\u2019t involve any new allegations against the company or any of its current executives, a Cognizant spokesman said in a statement. \u201cCognizant is committed to the highest ethical standards and has zero tolerance for any illegal or improper activity,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nMr. Thiruvengadam had participated in two videoconferences with three other Cognizant executives, where the decision was made to authorize a $2 million bribe, the SEC said. The bribe was paid to secure a planning permit for the construction of an office in Chennai, India, according to the agency.\n\nThe bribe, as well as a $500,000 commission to an unnamed contracting firm, was concealed in Cognizant\u2019s books through a series of falsified contract change requests, the SEC said. Mr. Thiruvengadam helped to conceal the payments by submitting false sub-certifications in connection with Cognizant\u2019s 2014 through 2016 audits, the agency said.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s order on Friday charged the former executive with violating the FCPA\u2019s internal controls and record-keeping provisions, and with causing related violations by Cognizant.\n\nMr. Thiruvengadam, an Indian national, served as Cognizant\u2019s chief operating officer from 2013 until his resignation in 2018.\n\nIn February, the Justice Department and the SEC announced dual criminal and civil bribery charges against Cognizant\u2019s former president, Gordon Coburn, and its former chief legal officer, Steven Schwartz.\n\nMessrs. Coburn and Schwartz have pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. Prosecutors have asked a judge in New Jersey to delay the SEC\u2019s civil case against the former executives until after the resolution of the criminal case.\n\nLawyers for Messrs. Coburn and Schwartz didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department hasn\u2019t announced any criminal charges against Mr. Thiruvengadam.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "Cognizant Technology Solutions\u2019 former chief operating officer has agreed to pay a $50,000 fine to settle civil charges that he helped authorize and conceal a bribe paid to an Indian official.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107506/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
