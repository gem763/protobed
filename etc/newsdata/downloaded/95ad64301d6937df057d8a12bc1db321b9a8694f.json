But they also believe he is tarnishing the Conservatives, setting fire to their vision of a big-tent party with priorities beyond Brexit.\n\nIn setting aside their usual caution and ripping the heart out of Mr. Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, they offered perhaps the clearest indication yet that the party, squabbling for decades over Europe, is now enmeshed in a civil war. Mr. Johnson\u2019s team vowed to kick the rebels \u2014 21 lawmakers, most of them ex-government ministers \u2014 out of the party and bar them from running in the next election.", "description": "A group of renegade Tory lawmakers \u2014 who only months ago were holding the reins of power \u2014 are trying to thwart Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for Brexit.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/world/03brexit-rebels-1/03brexit-rebels-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
