The NCAA pulled in $761 million from the 2017 NCAA tournament. That number is set to rise to $869 million this year.\n\nThe NCAA also generated $129.4 million in ticket revenue and $60 million in marketing rights for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nThe NCAA's expenses were $956 million. The largest chunk of that spending went to dispersing $560.3 million back to its roughly 1,100 member institutions in 24 sports in all three divisions, as well as $200 million for a one-time payment the NCAA made to schools to fund additional programs.\n\nAnother $160.5 million went to the Division I performance fund, which awards conferences based on how many teams play in the NCAA tournament and how far they advance. Units are paid out over six years.\n\nThe NCAA also recorded a $209 million settlement related to those past athletes who argued the value of their scholarships was illegally capped. A $70 million concussion testing and diagnosis settlement also hangs in the balance. The organization noted that it is still negotiating with its insurance carriers.", "description": "The NCAA generated $1.06 billion in revenue from September 2016 through August 2017 -- the first time it has surpassed the $1 billion mark.", "authors": ["Darren Rovell", "Dan Murphy", "Heather Dinich", "Myron Medcalf", "Vicki L.
