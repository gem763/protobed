She also had to contend with both of her younger siblings being seriously ill.\n\nIn an interview before the publication of her memoir, the 34-year-old told the Mail on Sunday that her PTSD was linked to another incident she had never previously spoken publicly about \u2013 being sexually assaulted by a relative in Bangladesh.\n\n\u201cNo doubt that would have played a role in my PTSD, my panic disorder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt must have done, because it\u2019s a memory that has stayed with me forever.\u201d\n\nHussain said she was confused rather than scared at the time and it was only years later that she understood what had happened to her when sex was explained in a biology class. Her reaction was to throw up in the laboratory bench sink, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to talk about it because it probably happens much more than we care to talk about,\u201d said Hussain.\n\nShe said she had only recently told her sisters about the sexual assault and admitted her parents would find parts of her book difficult reading.\n\nShe also talked about the impact the bullying, which stopped when she went to secondary school, had on her mental state, recounting hearing the word \u201csuicide\u201d on television for the first time aged 10.\n\nHussain said that one evening after school she had planned to kill herself but had been interrupted by the news that her mother was pregnant with her brother, Shak, and had decided to live for his sake.", "description": "Great British Bake Off winner says assault by relative played role in her anxiety and PTSD", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e7c97567959698e7300092d52cac3c1ba06564/130_142_2252_1350/master/2252.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a894339d9a6a3b4be6f779140bf4841e", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
