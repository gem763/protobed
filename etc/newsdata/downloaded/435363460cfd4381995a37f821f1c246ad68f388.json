ABC's David Wright is at the white house with that part of the story for us. David, good morning. Reporter: Good morning, whit. The president continues to insist he has nothing to fear from the impeachment process, but ABC news has learned there is a new effort to add a more robust team to the white house response team. On Friday, as two of trump's predecessors celebrated the life of congressman Elijah Cummings, the president offered some sympathetic words himself but inevitably brought the focus back to himself. President trump did not attend the funeral for the legendary Baltimore Democrat, instead as he left the white house to give a speech at an historically black college in South Carolina trump cast himself as a lonely figure battling impeachment alone. I don't have teams, everyone is talking about teams. I'm the team. I did nothing wrong. Reporter: Meanwhile in Baltimore, two former presidents celebrated the late civil rights leader. I loved this man. I loved his booming voice but we should hear him now in the quiet times at night and in the morning when we need courage. Reporter: Both Clinton and Obama pointedly held Cummings up as an honorable man and an example of public service at its best. There's nothing weak about being honorable. You're not a sucker to have integrity. And to treat others with respect. Reporter: In South Carolina president trump offered kind words of his own despite having clashed repeatedly with Cummings. Recently calling his district a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess. Not long ago I met with Elijah in the oval office and I saw the passion he had with me for lowering prescription drug prices. He had a very strong passion for that. Reporter: Toward the end of his remarks at Benedict college, trump compared the threat of impeachment with America's broken criminal justice system where African-Americans are five times more likely than whites to be incarcerated. We'll never let up on our efforts to ensure that our justice system is fair for every single American. And I have my own experience, you see what's going on with the witch hunt. And president trump sounding off about a variety of topics including the justice department, David. Now scrutinizing the government's Russia probe. Reporter: That's right, whit. The president was asked about that yesterday at his departure and also been tweeting about it this morning. Yesterday he said that all he knows is what he reads in the paper. He says he's leaving it all to the attorney general but he did add this. He said I will tell you this, you're going to see a lot of really bad things, whit. Investigate the investigators as the president said. David Wright at the white house, thank you.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The president did not attend the funeral for Elijah Cummings, instead leaving the White House to give a speech at an historically black college in South Carolina.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191026_wright1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
