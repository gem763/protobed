A spokesperson said the timing coincided with a later-than-usual spawning season. (Chessy Knight )\n\nBiologist Chessy Knight, who captured photos of the dead fish on Sept. 20, estimates about 300 fish were killed when the water levels in the Cheakamus River fell by about half over the course of a day.\n\nThe pink salmon were trapped in shallow pools and couldn't return to deeper, flowing sections of the river.\n\n\"This has been happening for many, many years on the Cheakamus,\" said Knight, who's also president of the Squamish River Watershed Society.\n\n\"But this is the first time that we saw adult spawners also affected by these flow manipulations.\"\n\nThat's significant, she said, because those spawning salmon never had a chance to lay their eggs and produce much-needed offspring.\n\n'We take it extremely seriously'\n\nBC Hydro is aware of the issue and acknowledges responsibility.\n\n\"It was unexpected. We thought that by lowering the levels at the rate we did, the salmon would not be stranded and would be able to find their way to deeper water in time,\" said spokesperson Geoff Hastings.\n\nBC Hydro runs a nearby power facility and is allowed to increase or decrease the water flow in the river as needed. Hastings also noted that this is not the first time fish have been stranded as a result of ramping.\n\nAccording to Hastings, the company had to lower the levels in September because of public safety concerns \u2014 and that the facility has to balance safety, environmental protection and energy generation.\n\n\"We take it extremely seriously,\" Hastings said. \"We don't want to be stranding fish and we are trying to learn from these events and then hopefully not do it again.\"\n\nAnglers fishing in the Squamish River earlier this summer. (Francesca Knight)\n\n'Not sustainable'\n\nKnight said BC Hydro should have known better and waited for the spawning fish to get to safety.\n\n\"BC Hydro should have just left the river alone until we got the big fall rains,\" she said.\n\nBC Hydro's water licence, which allows it to control the river flows, is currently undergoing a government review.\n\nKnight said her group is advocating for slower rates of ramping and more water to be left in the river in order to avoid stranding fish.\n\n\"There's this common perception that hydroelectric power is harmless but ... it is not harmless. It is not without impact,\" she said.\n\n\"We should have hydro as part of our clean energy portfolio, but the way it's being done is not sustainable.\"", "description": "Clint Goyette has spent a lot of time on the rivers around Squamish, B.C., over the last two decades as a fishing guide, but even he was shocked to see hundreds of dead fish lying in pools along the Cheakamus River recently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310196.1570232225!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dead-salmon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
