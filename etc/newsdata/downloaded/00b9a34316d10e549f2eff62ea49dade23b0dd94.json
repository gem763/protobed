Council, gathered for their first forum Thursday evening to pitch themselves as ethical alternatives to a scandal-tainted incumbent.\n\nEvans (D-Ward 2), the target of a federal investigation as well as a probe by the council, has easily won reelection since first taking office in 1991. But for the first time in a decade, Evans is facing a half-dozen challengers for the Democratic nomination in next year\u2019s city election.\n\nHe was absent from the candidate forum and has not announced whether he will seek another term.\n\nThe field lining up against him features three neighborhood commissioners, a former Obama administration staffer who also worked on Capitol Hill, and two political newcomers.\n\n[Jack Evans was a sure bet at election time. Ethics scandals changed that.]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an appetite for change and an appetite for a council member with the integrity to represent the interests of all of the ward\u2019s residents,\u201d said Patrick Kennedy, a 28-year-old Foggy Bottom neighborhood commissioner who went from co-chairing Evans\u2019s 2016 reelection campaign to gunning for his job.\n\nJordan Grossman, a 33-year-old former federal worker, repeatedly blasted Evans as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and said he would mark a \u201cclean break\u201d from the incumbent\u2019s political network.\n\n\n\nPatrick Kennedy.

Sowa)\n\nKishan Putta, a 45-year-old Burleith neighborhood commissioner, focused his criticism of Evans on the city\u2019s controversial decision to allow a private school to gain special access to a public recreation field. Asked to name something Evans did right in 28 years in office, Putta responded after a long pause, \u201cHe did very well for himself.\u201d\n\nJohn Fanning, a 56-year-old Logan Circle-area neighborhood commissioner, rarely mentioned Evans and focused on parochial ward issues such as business retention and various community projects that he played a role in.\n\n\u201cI know how to navigate the government, and I know how to get things done,\u201d said Fanning, who would be the council\u2019s only openly gay member.\n\n\n\nKishan Putta, left, in 2014.

(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nPolitical newcomers Daniel Hernandez, a former Marine who now works for Microsoft, and Yilin Zhang, a daughter of Chinese immigrants who works in health care, also appeared at Thursday\u2019s forum, at the Woman\u2019s National Democratic Club in Dupont Circle. The event was moderated by Delvone Michael, a strategist with the Working Families Party.\n\nAll of Evans\u2019s challengers are using the District\u2019s new public financing program, which provides matching funds to candidates who raise money from small donors chipping in less than $50. Grossman has led in early fundraising.\n\nWard 2 is one of the wealthiest parts of the District, stretching from western neighborhoods including Georgetown and Foggy Bottom through Dupont Circle and the downtown core.\n\nEvans has long been one of the most business-friendly members of the council, overseeing tax abatement legislation and opposing higher taxes and regulations. He is also known for advocating for LGBTQ rights long before that was a mainstream Democratic issue.\n\nThroughout his career, Evans has faced scrutiny for his close ties to executives and others seeking to do business with the city.\n\n[Why Jack Evans votes on his own discipline]\n\nBut the stakes have escalated over the past two years. A federal grand jury issued subpoenas to the city government for documents about Evans and his private consulting and legal clients, and federal agents searched the lawmaker\u2019s Georgetown home over the summer.\n\nAfter The Washington Post published emails in which Evans touted his influence and connections as an elected official while soliciting jobs from law firms, the District\u2019s ethics board fined Evans $20,000 and he was forced to resign as board chairman of the Metro public transit agency. The D.C. Council hired a law firm to investigate Evans \u2014 a probe that is underway \u2014 and ousted him as chair of the influential Finance and Revenue Committee. There is also an effort to force an election to recall Evans before his term expires.\n\nThese recent events provided fodder for Evans\u2019s political opponents Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to compete for the time and attention of the council member with the paying clients who can afford his price,\u201d said Grossman, the former federal worker, who also worked for a D.C. health-care agency. \u201cWe need a council member that is focused on us, not his personal finance interest.\u201d\n\nPutta sounded similar alarms in his closing statement.\n\nEvans \u201chas turned his back on his constituents, and that is the worst thing he has done,\u201d said Putta, who also ran for an at-large council seat in 2014.\n\nEvans did not return a request for comment Friday. He has asked his council colleagues to withhold judgment until the conclusion of the investigations, which he said would show \u201cmy actions \u2014 while not becoming \u2014 are far from that which has been reported or suggested.\u201d\n\n\n\nD.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) in June. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe D.C. Council has been drifting leftward in recent years, and the changing politics were on display at the candidate forum.\n\nAll candidates said they wanted to restrict campaign contributions from city contractors, decried racial disparities in policing and pushed for more dedicated bike and bus lanes.\n\nOne of the few issues where candidates were split involved a pending bill to decriminalize sex work. Fanning, who has criticized prostitution in Logan Circle, said he had not made up his mind. Kennedy drew hisses when he said he opposes the bill as written. The others were supportive.\n\nSome critics of Evans have worried that a crowded primary field will splinter votes and hand Evans a victory, prompting conversations about whether the challengers should unite around the strongest contender.\n\nAsked whether they would drop out and endorse a rival if Evans ran again, every candidate except for Putta said they would consider it or wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\n\n\u201cThe number-one priority needs to be getting him out of office, so yes, I would consider it if it came down to it,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nRead more on D.C. 2020 races\n\nBrandon Todd ramps up reelection early as he faces liberal challenger\n\nSchool board vice chair Markus Batchelor to challenge Grosso for at-large seat\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The council member, who is under federal investigation, hasn\u2019t filed paperwork for reelection.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
