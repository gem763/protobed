Administration officials credited Mr. Trump with the resiliency of the law even as they echoed his contempt for it. [\u2026] The 4-percent price decline is only the second time that average monthly premiums have dropped year-to-year since the marketplace opened in 2014, and it is a sign that the health law is stabilizing after several years of turmoil caused in part by Mr. Trump.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of a recent Washington Post report on the success \u201cObamacare\u201d has had in saving the lives of many Americans.\n\nAs a political matter, however, the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, deserves credit for the ACA\u2019s resiliency is demonstrably ridiculous. Circling back to our earlier coverage, the Republican president first declared the death of the Affordable Care Act on March 17, 2017. \u201cI also want people to know that Obamacare is dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dead health care plan. It\u2019s not even a health care plan\u2026. Obamacare is not an alternative. It\u2019s not there. It\u2019s dead. It\u2019s dead. \u201d He hadn\u2019t quite been in office for two months.\n\nThe Republican proceeded to repeat the claim obsessively for months, telling anyone who\u2019d listen that the health care reform law is \u201cdead.\u201d \u201cGone.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely dead.\u201d \u201cFinished.\u201d A \u201cdead carcass.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, this White House went to extraordinary lengths to sabotage the health care system, only to fail to kill its target. The ACA is persevering, but that\u2019s happening despite Trump, not because of him.\n\nLooking ahead, however, the reform law\u2019s future remains uncertain. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing a Republican lawsuit that intends to destroy the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, including the elimination of protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration \u2013 which is to say, the folks who believe the president deserves credit for the law\u2019s ability to endure \u2013 endorsed the litigation and asked courts to destroy the existing system, its protections, and its benefits.\n\nA ruling from the appeals court could come at any time.\n\nEven if the law survives the latest court challenge, there\u2019s still the legislative threat to consider. Earlier this year, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that if Republicans fare well in the 2020 elections, \u201cI can promise you \u2026 we going to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nLast month, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) echoed the message, emphasizing that ACA repeal remains a Republican priority.\n\nThe fact that the health care law is working appears to be an inconvenient detail for which the party has no use.", "description": "The Trump administration wants credit for the ACA's resilience.
