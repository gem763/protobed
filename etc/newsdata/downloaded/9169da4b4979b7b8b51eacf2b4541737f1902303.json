The photographer used social media to identify Benjamin Tabile, the man wearing glasses in the center of the frame.\n\nI took this photograph exactly 12 years ago today, just as the South Tower of the World Trade Center started to collapse: a cross-section of New Yorkers, united in terror, standing at Park Row and Beekman Street in lower Manhattan. Since then it\u2019s been published dozens of times in newspapers and magazines across the world, but I\u2019ve never known the names behind the faces. Last year I posted the photo on Facebook and Twitter in hopes of discovering their identities. After it was shared more than 10,000 times, I now know two of them.\n\nEdward Tabile contacted me, saying he recognized his father, Benjamin Tabile, as the man in the center wearing the glasses. Benjamin was supposed to be in the World Trade Center towers that day for a job interview but was running late.\n\n\"As I walked out of the subway, I saw the building on fire and didn't know why,\" he said. \"I was in complete shock. I would have been in that building while the planes hit.\"\n\nI want to know them all.
