I wanted them to feel all the different body types, all the different women in different stages of their womanhood.\u201d\n\nRihanna\u2019s highly anticipated runway comes at a time when the brand snagged $50 million investment last month from rapper Jay-Z\u2019s venture capital firm Marcy Venture Partners LLC and growth-equity firm Avenir Growth Capital, according to Billboard.\n\nThe brand also landed an exclusive deal with Amazon Prime Video that will allow participating members to access at-home streaming of the show starting Sept. 20.\n\nThe rest of the collection included 50 looks comprised of lacy, fishnet or satin bralettes and undergarments. Other notable pieces included an assortment of body suits and pajamas. The sultry looks were juxtaposed with the interactive showcase\u2019s lush tropical and arid desert backdrops.\n\nEach model walked through the moving biomes in a choreographed sequence that emulated dance and animal-inspired movements. Some wore ensembles in neon, animal print, nude and jewel tones.\n\nThe fall-winter Savage X Fenty collection was available for purchase immediately after the show.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear the word savage, it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory,\u201d Rihanna explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a confident word. It\u2019s a word that is fearless, and I feel like the women here tonight represented that word, savage, and I feel every woman has a savage inside of them, whether they found it or not. It\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nRihanna also rolled out an update to her #iamsavage Collection, which boasts a variety of lingerie essentials that are mostly under $20 and feature a rose gold logo.\n\nSavage X Fenty is available in sizes that range from 32A to 40DDD in bras and XS to 3X in undies and sleepwear. Many pieces can be bought for less than $100.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Savage X Fenty lingerie line by Rihanna closed out New York Fashion Week with a body positive showcase.
