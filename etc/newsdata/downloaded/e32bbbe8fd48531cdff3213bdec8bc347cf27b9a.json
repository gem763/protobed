I was instructed to go to Gatineau or Pembroke if I couldn't make it to the Shawville hospital,\" Lavigne told CBC News recently. \"Luckily, my water didn't break over the weekend. In fact, my water broke on Wednesday.\"\n\nWhen Lavigne called the Pontiac Hospital on the evening of Oct. 6, she said she was told there still weren't enough nurses to deliver her baby.\n\nStaff explained she'd instead have to go to the Gatineau Hospital, roughly 80 kilometres away. Lavigne \u2014 who was in active labour \u2014 then called paramedics, who insisted they'd been instructed to take her to Shawville.\n\nAmidst all that confusion, her son Vincent was born in the ambulance.\n\n\"My delivery was fast and furious!\" she recalled, laughing. \"My plan A was Shawville. The plan B was Gatineau. Delivering him in the ambulance wasn't the plan C, D or even E.\"\n\nThe Lavigne-Wolfe family at the Pontiac Hospital in Shawville, Que., shortly before being transferred to Gatineau.

It was an experience the young mother described as \"stressful\" and \"unsettling\".\n\n\"You have no control over what will happen, so you just have to roll with it at that point,\" she said.\n\nThe local health agency told CBC they were indeed anticipating a service interruption that evening, although in the end one didn't happen.\n\n\"We transferred her to make sure she could safely access aftercare for her and her baby\", said Centre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 et de services sociaux de l'Outaouais (CISSSO) spokesperson Marie-Pier Despr\u00e9s in a French-language email.\n\nLocal mayors are hoping to have a meeting with the province about the ongoing staffing issues at the Pontiac Hospital in Shawville, Que. (Christian Milette/Radio-Canada)\n\nOngoing staffing issues\n\nLavigne shared her story with CBC as a staff shortage this weekend forced another shutdown of the hospital's gynecology and obstetrics unit.\n\nIn a news release, CISSSO said the department will be closed from 8 a.m Friday until 8 a.m. Monday.\n\nBeing a Pontiac resident, Lavigne was well aware of the staffing problems at the local hospital.\n\n\"I knew over the summer there were service interruptions. And they hired a team of midwives to come in and fill in where the nurses were lacking,\" she said.\n\nAll the nurses she dealt with at the Pontiac Hospital had been very helpful, she added, even if they appeared tired.\n\n\"They are extremely overworked and they are doing the best they can. Our nurse hadn't taken a break all day,\" she said.\n\n'A burden on the patients'\n\nShawville's mayor, Sandra Murray, called the repeated shutdowns a \"shame\" and \"a burden on the patients.\"\n\n\"People are talking about it on the street,\" she said. \"They are upset. If you're nine months pregnant and due any day, and you have to drive to the city to have your baby, it's upsetting. It's not proper or fair.\"\n\nThe issue was brought up at a meeting of the regional municipality last week, Murray said. The municipality's various mayors are now planning to send a letter to the Quebec government asking for a further meeting, she added.\n\nAs for Lavigne, her two-week old baby is healthy, and the circumstances of his birth will \"forever be a memory\".\n\n\"I learned that plan A won't always happen exactly like you pictured,\" she said.", "description": "A nursing shortage at the Pontiac Hospital resulted in Virginia Lavigne giving birth to her second son in an ambulance \u2014 and then being sent to the Gatineau Hospital, almost 80 kilometres away.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327015.1571522440!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/virginia-lavigne.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
