It's been a while since we've performed in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"If there's a place where people want to see us, we'll go there. That's really how we feel,\" added 23-year-old singer Jimin, whose real name is Park Ji-min.\n\nIn July, BTS attracted criticism after they announced an October 11 show in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Some fans pointed out the apparent contradiction between BTS's tour message -- \"Love Yourself\" -- and Saudi Arabia's criminalization of same-sex relationships.\n\nBTS's announcement came only a week after American rapper Nicki Minaj cancelled a scheduled performance in the country, saying it was important for her to support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.\n\nI'm really glad they recognize their huge Arab fanbase and make a concert in Saudi Arabia. have fun Arab Armys! I purple you!\ud83d\udc9c\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, same-sex sexual activity is illegal , public spaces are mostly segregated by gender and women's rights remain restricted\n\nThough none of BTS's members are openly LGBTQ, the group has been seen as sympathetic towards the LGBTQ community, especially compared with other K-pop groups who tend to stay silent on such topics.\n\nIn 2013, before the group officially debuted, BTS leader RM tweeted about his appreciation for Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's song \"Same Love,\" which celebrates same-sex relationships. BTS fans -- who are known as ARMY -- have also celebrated the group's collaboration with Halsey, an openly bisexual American artist.\n\nCNN has reached out to BTS's label Big Hit Entertainment for comment.\n\nThe show in Riyadh will be BTS's first performance after their five-week summer break -- the first time they took an extended period of time off since their debut in 2013.\n\nWhy is Saudi Arabia inviting international pop stars?\n\nBTS and Minaj aren't the first stars to be invited to play in the kingdom. This year, Mariah Carey held her own concert in Saudi Arabia, despite backlash from women's rights activists.\n\nIt's all part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 , an effort to reduce the kingdom's reliance on oil and make Saudi Arabia a more moderate kingdom\n\nThe kingdom is attempting to create economic activity at home and encourage citizens to spend their money within its borders.\n\nAs part of that, the Crown Prince called for greater investment in the entertainment industry, with the goal of positioning the nation among the top four entertainment destinations in Asia . Last week, Saudi Arabia announced a new scheme that allows 49 different countries to get a visa on arrival.\n\nBut the move away from petrodollars might not be easy.\n\nThere are few entertainment attractions in Saudi Arabia due to its ultraconservatism -- hence, the Jeddah World Fest in July, where Minaj had been invited to play.", "description": "", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190620152714-bts-billboard-super-tease.jpg"}
