The court in that case ordered the legislature to draw new district lines, which it did a couple of weeks later.\n\nThe rulings come after the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that federal judges have no authority to place limits on the drawing of voting maps for partisan gain. That decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, left open the prospect that state courts could rule on partisan gerrymandering claims under their own state constitutions. Voting-rights advocates are turning to state courts in the wake of that ruling.\n\nThe North Carolina court in both of its rulings has relied in part on a provision of the North Carolina Constitution that guarantees free and fair elections.\n\nSome 30 states have a constitutional requirement for free elections.\n\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "description": "A panel of North Carolina judges blocked the state from using a Republican-drawn congressional map for the 2020 elections, stepping in after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to referee the matter.", "authors": ["Brent Kendall", "Brent.Kendall Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121536/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
