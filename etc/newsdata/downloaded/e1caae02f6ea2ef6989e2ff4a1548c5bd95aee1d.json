There is no better costume than one taken directly from the early 00s \u2014 a time of low-rise jeans, heart-shaped sunglasses, and trucker hats \u2014 where the fashion was so bad it was somehow good.\n\nThere are so many iconic looks from this era that are just excessive and outrageous enough to be recognized. And with most of the trends coming back into style, most of these pieces won\u2019t be too hard to find. We\u2019ve got your throwback celeb costume inspo right here, from Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears\u2019s iconic double denim to Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s coordinating camouflage.\n\nPhoto by Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nJustin and Britney\n\nThere is not a millennial on this planet who doesn\u2019t remember Justin and Britney rolling up to the American Music Awards red carpet, both absolutely drowning in denim. What was it about the early 2000s that forced everyone to match with their boyfriend, best friend, neighbor, etc.? We\u2019re not sure, but who doesn\u2019t want a partner who commits to a Canadian tuxedo.\n\nCharlie\u2019s Angels\n\nWhat better time to pay tribute to the original trio of crime-fighting women and their iconic 00s wardrobe, than before the release of the upcoming remake. Those all black outfits from the movie poster are almost as badass as the angels themselves.\n\nVictoria and David Beckham\n\nThere are far too many looks to choose from when it comes to the Beckhams, but none are as memorable as the matching purple outfits they wore for their wedding reception in 1999. Even baby Brooklyn is rocking a purple top hat. I mean come on.\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston\n\nIn the early aughts, the only thing better than one pair of swishy cargo pants, was two pairs of swishy cargo pants. Brad is kind of notorious for turning into his girlfriends in the same way that older women over time start to resemble their purse-sized dogs. So if you\u2019re not a Jen fan, you could take it all the way back to BP\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow days, which are far more serious, terrifying, and involve less cargo pants.\n\nPhoto by John Stanton/WireImage\n\nParis and Kim K.\n\nThe ultimate BFF duo circa 2005. Complete with Juicy tracksuits and Sidekick cell phones.\n\nA *young* Mary Kate and Ashley\n\nBefore the fashion empire and all the nicotine. These girls were servin\u2019 some looks. From their cowgirl chic aesthetic to those Billboard Dad round sunglasses and chokers \u2014 they knew what they were doing.\n\nPhoto by George De Sota/Newsmakers\n\nJ.Lo and Diddy\n\nAnother outfit that will be forever ingrained in fashion history. That white bandana. Those hoop earrings. That diamond cross necklace the size of a small child. So much nostalgia wrapped up into one very good couples costume.\n\nJen Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, and Courteney Cox\n\nThe One Where Everyone Ties Something Around Their Waist. Not to mention these looks are very VSCO girl. The only thing they\u2019re missing are a couple of hydroflasks.\n\nDestiny\u2019s Child\n\nSpeaking of matching outfits: Destiny\u2019s Child were the absolute queens of the matching outfit trend of the 2000s \u2014 all thanks to Tina Knowles. From coordinated army print looks to American flag pants to whatever TF these blue and orange things are.\n\nWill and Jada\n\nMakes sense that arguably the best couple in Hollywood also gives us the best costume inspo. These matching all-white ensembles are as timeless (kind of) as the couple themselves.", "description": "This spooky szn we suggest revisiting the early 00s for the unforgettable fashion that was so bad it was good.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf2822e60fe9000a44f161/lede/1571840686782-pjimage-2.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.562xh;0xw,0.0113xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
