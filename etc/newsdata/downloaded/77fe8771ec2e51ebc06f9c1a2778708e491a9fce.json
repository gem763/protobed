Revolution of our age!\u201d\n\nBlizzard responded by suspending blitzchung from competition for a year, adding that he will receive no prize money from Grandmasters Season 2.\n\n\u201cI expected the decision by Blizzard,\u201d blitzchung told IGN.com. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair, but I do respect their decision. I\u2019m not (regretful) of what I said.\u201d\n\nBlizzard also said it would no longer work with the two casters in the video. They reportedly encouraged blitzchung\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cDuring the Asia-Pacific Grandmasters broadcast over the weekend there was a competition rule violation during a post-match interview, involving Blitzchung and two casters, which resulted in the removal of the match VOD replay,\u201d Blizzard said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGrandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone Esports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously. After an investigation, we are taking the necessary actions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to re-emphasize tournament and player conduct within the Hearthstone esports community from both players and talent. While we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.\u201d\n\nBlizzard cited the 2019 Hearthstone Grandmasters Official Competition Rules section 6.1 (o), which reads:\n\n\u201cEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player\u2019s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard\u2019s Website Terms.\u201d\n\nThe incident mirrors an NBA controversy sparked last week when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a now-deleted comment on Twitter: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know, there are serious protests in my country now,\u201d blitzchung said in a statement to Inven Global.\n\n\u201cMy call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention. I put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months that I sometimes couldn\u2019t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Blizzard Entertainment suspended Hong Kong-based Hearthstone player Chung \"blitzchung\" Ng Wai for his public support of pro-democracy protestors in the city during a postgame interview on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
