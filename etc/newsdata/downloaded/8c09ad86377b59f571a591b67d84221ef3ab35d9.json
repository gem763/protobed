I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop? I don't think I've ever seen Tulsa 1921 on screen in any genre...'\n\nTwitter user @DarrenCromwell1 added some historical contest, along with a Wikipedia entry for the riots.\n\n'After WW1 in the US, racial tension was high. As they are today. Amazing parallels between now and something that happened almost 100 years ago. Meshing reality and alternate history can create truths about our shared history together in this country,' Cromwell said.\n\nUpsetting: 'Didn't know HBO's Watchmen opened with a dramatization of the Tulsa massacre and it's one of the most upsetting things I've seen all year,' said New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie\n\nContext: Twitter user @DarrenCromwell1 added some historical contest, along with a Wikipedia entry for the riots\n\nThe opening moments of the pilot follow a young boy watching a silent film, which depicted a black U.S. Marshal named Bass Reeves, which journalist Karama Horne revealed was a real person as well.\n\n'Here's another tidbit if you just saw @watchmen. Bass Reeves, the Sheriff that was depicted in the old moving in the beginning, was also real. He is who the Lone Rangers is based on,' she said.\n\nThe riot scenes are rather disturbing, with mobs of white men killing black men and women on the streets, as this family struggles to keep their son safe.\n\nReal: The opening moments of the pilot follow a young boy watching a silent film, which depicted a black U.S. Marshal named Bass Reeves, which journalist Karama Horne revealed was a real person as well\n\nThe young boy ultimately wakes up in the middle of a field, finding a young baby laying in the grass, as he takes it and walks down the road... before the scene transitions to present day 2019.\n\nIn this world, police hide their identity behind masks, with one black cop pulling over a white man in a truck, who is seen with a Rorschach mask in his glove compartment.\n\nIn the comics and the 2009 feature film adaptation, Rorschach was one of the main heroes, but in this series, the Rorschach mask is the symbol worn by a white supremacist organization known as The 7th Cavalry.\n\nRorschach: In this world, police hide their identity behind masks, with one black cop pulling over a white man in a truck, who is seen with a Rorschach mask in his glove compartment\n\nAnother example of how this world is vastly different, along with the cops shielding their identity from terrorist organizations, is the fact that cops need authorization from supervisors to release their firearms.\n\nUnfortunately for this officer, Charlie Sutton (Charles Brice) the firearm release happened just seconds too late, since this man with the Rorscach mask shot through his windshield several times, nearly killing him.\n\nWhile the exact motive of the shooting is unknown, police chief Judd Crawford (Don Johnson) believes it's the work of The 7th Cavalry, who have seemingly resurfaced after being dormant for three years.\n\nChief: While the exact motive of the shooting is unknown, police chief Judd Crawford (Don Johnson) believes it's the work of The 7th Cavalry, who have seemingly resurfaced after being dormant for three years\n\nThe pilot then introduces Detective Angela Abar, a.k.a. Sister Night (Regina King), who puts on a demonstration for her kid Topher's (Dylan Schombing) class.\n\nShe shows them how to separate egg whites from the yolks, making an egg smiley face of sorts, a nod to the smiley face in the comics.\n\nShe then reveals to the kids that she was born in Vietnam, before it became a 'state,' and was a cop in Vietnam and for a few years in Tulsa before she retired.\n\nWhen one of the kids asks why she retired, Abar reveals that she was one of the cops that was attacked in an incident three years earlier known as the White Night, before police officers wore masks, leading her to retire and open her bakery.\n\nSister Night: The pilot then introduces Detective Angela Abar, a.k.a. Sister Night (Regina King), who puts on a demonstration for her kid Topher's (Dylan Schombing) class\n\nThe demonstration ends rather violently, when an insolent kid asks if she paid for the bakery with 'Redfordations,' payouts from President Robert Redford (yes, the actor) as a form of reparations.\n\nThis insulting question lead to her kid Dylan to attack him, leaving him with a bloody nose as his mother takes him home.\n\nAnother strange anomaly in this world happens on the drive home, when a siren starts blaring and small squid start raining from the sky for a short time.\n\nCops: The demonstration ends rather violently, when an insolent kid asks if she paid for the bakery with 'Redfordations,' payouts from President Robert Redford (yes, the actor) as a form of reparations\n\nIt's also revealed that Abar's bakery is basically a front for her police work, where she changes into her Sister Knight persona and leaves in a black Monte Carlo.\n\nWhen Sister Night arrives at the precinct, dozens of masked cops are watching a video from The 7th Cavalry, revealing their racist mission, three years after the White Night, with Crawford authorizing the release of firearms.\n\nThere are also nods to the Watchmen comics, with a copy of Under the Hood on Crawford's desk, the autobiography of one of the original Watchmen known as the Minutemen, Hollis Mason, a.k.a. Nite Owl.\n\nFront: It's also revealed that Abar's bakery is basically a front for her police work, where she changes into her Sister Knight persona and leaves in a black Monte Carlo\n\nSister Night grabs one of the supposed white supremacist's, who is put in a strange pod where a number of images are shown all around him, including one of Mount Rushmore only Richard Nixon is on there.\n\nWhile there are similar moments in the Watchmen comics that reflect an alternate American history, the show is definitely not an adaptation of the iconic books, which has been a sticking point with some fans, but writer Kamala Horne said it was never meant to be an adaptation.\n\n'For those of you out there saying that this is not Alan Moore's Watchmen, you are correct. The creators have stated it was never meant to be (I also don't care).'\n\nNo adaptation: While there are similar moments in the Watchmen comics that reflect an alternate American history, the show is definitely not an adaptation of the iconic books, which has been a sticking point with some fans, but writer Kamala Horne said it was never meant to be an adaptation\n\nTwitter user David Dennis Jr. stated, 'Watchmen has always been about twisted versions of Golden Age superheroes we've come to love.\n\n'So the episode opens up with a twisted Superman origin story of a baby discovered from the ashes of the Tulsa massacre. Tulsa is Krypton, a utopia that came to an end.'\n\nThat baby would come into play in a unique way, as the episode comes to an end with a bizarre shootout at a cattle ranch, which is where The 7th Cavalry has been holing up.\n\nBaby: Twitter user David Dennis Jr. stated, 'Watchmen has always been about twisted versions of Golden Age superheroes we've come to love\n\nOne of the more bizarre story threads in this episode follows Jeremy Irons' character, who has an affinity for typing in the nude.\n\nWhile his character's name has never been revealed, he's listed on IMDB as being Adrian Veidt, a.k.a. Ozymandias.\n\nThere is a brief scene where a newspaper states that Veidt has been confirmed dead, but he seems to be alive and well, celebrating an 'anniversary' of sorts with his maid and assistant Mister Phillips presenting him with a gold pocket watch.\n\nBizarre: One of the more bizarre story threads in this episode follows Jeremy Irons' character, who has an affinity for typing in the nude\n\nThe episode ends with Crawford going to visit Charlie Sutton, the cop who was shot at the beginning of the episode, after he woke up.\n\nAbar gets a call from a strange man, asking if she's Angela Abar and if her father is Marcus Abar, saying she needs to see something and he knows who she is so 'don't wear no god damn mask.\n\nWhen she gets there, she finds her boss Crawford has been hung from the oak tree, and the man in the wheelchair, Will Reeves (Louis Gossett Jr.) sitting below him... with the note Watch Over This Boy.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Reeves asked Abar in front of her bakery if she thinks he could lift over 200 pounds, and she said yes, and it seems he was talking about lifting Crawford to hang him.\n\nStrange man: Abar gets a call from a strange man, asking if she's Angela Abar and if her father is Marcus Abar, saying she needs to see something and he knows who she is so 'don't wear no god damn mask\n\nThe trailer for the rest of the season on Watchmen reveals that Reeves was the one who hung the chief of police, while adding that he's 105 years old and that he thinks Abar curses too much.\n\nThe trailer also introduces Lori Blake (Jean Smart), an FBI agent brought in to investigate Crawford's death.\n\nIrons' character Veidt is also planning to use the greatest weapon out there, fear, to prevent mankind's extinction, while Hong Chau's Lady Trieu revealing she has a 'secret plan to save humanity, and it starts in Oklahoma.'\n\nThe final shot of the trailer hints that the blue-skinned Dr. Manhattan will be featured in the future episodes of the nine-episode season.\n\nDr. Manhattan: The final shot of the trailer hints that the blue-skinned Dr. Manhattan will be featured in the future episodes of the nine-episode season\n\nFans had numerous different reactions, with David Dennis Jr. stating, 'Imagine being a MAGA comic book fan in 2019 and Wolverine and Cyclops are having sex and Watchmen is about killing white supremacists.'\n\nActress/comedian Aisha Tyler added, 'Lord give me the strength to handle these feelings I have in my feelings about @watchmen.'\n\nBirth.Movies.Death editor Scott Wampler added, 'This is my third time through with the WATCHMEN pilot and I'm still noticing s**t I previously missed.
