Why should we when he so frequently breaks his word and makes \u00adpromises he cannot keep?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nDrug victory\n\nThe NHS can now provide a drug that will transform the lives of thousands of cystic fibrosis patients.\n\nThis is only possible because the US drugs giant Vertex had to be shamed into dropping the price for its Orkambi medicine.\n\nThe pharmaceutical firm wanted to charge more than \u00a3100,000 a year per patient for this life-changing drug, making it unaffordable.\n\nVertex only agreed to lower the price after Jeremy Corbyn used his conference speech to promise to change the law to stop firms from abusing their monopoly.\n\nIt is also the result of dogged campaigning by charities and the families of patients. They should cherish the victory even though it was a battle they should never have had to fight.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nRat racers\n\nResearchers have taught rats how to drive tiny cars.\n\nIt gives a whole new meaning to tailbacks.", "description": "Boris Johnson once said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than not complete Brexit by this deadline but now this won't happen", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Reuters", "Uk Parliamentary Recording Unit Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_British-Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson-is-seen-outside-Downing-Street-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
