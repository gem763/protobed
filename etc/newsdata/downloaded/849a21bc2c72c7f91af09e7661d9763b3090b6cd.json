Formerly subject to an import levy of 18%, the new tariffs - part of WTO-authorized countermeasures to Airbus subsidies - will increase the total import duty to the United States to 43%.\n\nThe people of northern Greece are not impressed.\n\n\u201cTrump would do well to behave himself and let us get to work so we can have a livelihood,\u201d said peach farmer Tasos Halkidis. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this tariff business.\u201d\n\nThis fertile plain straddling the regions of Imathia and Pella in central Macedonia is one massive peach orchard. A sea of pink greets visitors in the spring, when the peaches are in bloom.\n\nStanding in a huge warehouse piled high with millions of aluminium cans, 63-year-old Kostas Apostolou, head of the Greek Canners Association, says the dispute is threatening their livelihood and will potentially shut them out of their biggest market.\n\n\u201cWhy are they punishing us?\u201d Apostolou told Reuters.\n\nPEACHES TARIFF SPIKE\n\nThe increase in tariffs came into effect on Oct. 18, just as Greeks readied to ship 50 million tins to U.S. markets.\n\nMany customers there - mainly catering companies that supply hospitals, schools and the military - have either canceled orders or have said they will not be prepared to pay for any tariff increase, producers said.\n\n\u201cSuddenly there was this (trade) war... We could never imagine that this could affect our jobs here in this small area,\u201d Apostolou said.\n\nStuck with excess supply, producers are also uncomfortably aware how their production lines are tailored to the U.S. market. The sector is saddled with 3-kg tins aimed at the United States, which cannot be sold in Europe, Asia or Latin America where 1-kg tins are dispatched.\n\nThe Canners Association and other industry experts say the income that will be lost from the U.S. market is about $50 million - a small amount in terms of international trade but vital for one of the poorer regions in Greece with unemployment at 20%.\n\nThey are worried that resulting excess product will lead to a collapse in prices and unemployment will jump.\n\nThe heart of Greek peach country is planted with millions of trees in an area of more than 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres). About 10,000 small farms and 10,000 employees work for 17 can factories in the area, with the peach crop giving life to the wider Imathia and Pella regions.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shock,\u201d says Eleftherios Saitis, who built one of the first can factories in the early 1970s.\n\nThe sector is already reeling from the impact of a Russian embargo on the EU fruit and vegetable sector imposed in 2014. Farmers worry this might be the final blow.\n\n\u201cNow with the tariffs from the United States, it will be a very big hit, it will be a catastrophe,\u201d said Halkidis.", "description": "A tariff war between the European Union and the United States is threatening to buckle one of Greece's most buoyant export sectors, which survived a decade of economic crises but possibly not President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Lefteris Papadimas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445767947&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0G6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
