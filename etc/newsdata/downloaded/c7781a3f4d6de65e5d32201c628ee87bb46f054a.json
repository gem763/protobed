'He'll be out for a while. He needs time to fully, fully recover, so I don't think he'll be back.\n\n'Maybe Sheffield United (on November 24) after the international break but probably December before you can see him.\n\n'It's the ankle rather than foot. I'm not the doctor but there is an injury there that needs healing.'\n\nUnited climbed eight places to seventh in the Premier League table at the end of a week that saw Solskjaer's side take a point from an encouraging display against leaders Liverpool, beat Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League in Serbia and then post their first away win in the Premier League in eight months at Carrow Road.\n\nPogba recently posted to social media saying that he is 'almost there' following his injury\n\nThe midfielder had been working on his rehab in Dubai while wearing heavy ankle bandaging\n\nThe United manager paid tribute to Anthony Martial who has scored on his two starts against Partizan and Norwich after returning from an eight-week lay-off.\n\nDespite missing a penalty at Norwich, the Frenchman combined superbly with Marcus Rashford to score United's third goal.\n\n'It's great to see them link up,' said Solskjaer. 'We've missed Anthony the last two months and it's great to have him back.\n\n'He's vital for us. He's a top striker and to have him back, fit, smiling enjoying his football is a big thing for us. He's clever in his movement but he's not been given credit for his clever defending.\n\n'Him and Marcus, they're just going to improve and grow. It was a great finish by Anthony.'\n\nSolskjaer also praised Rashford who recovered from his own penalty miss to score with a cool finish.\n\n'I thought the reaction to his miss was excellent,' said the Norwegian. 'He ran back, chased, won the ball back and scored a great goal.'", "description": "Manchester United 's record signing has missed eight of the last 10 games with the problem that he first suffered against Southampton in August and then aggravated when he returned last month.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20256262-0-image-a-56_1572215453822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
