Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIt didn\u2019t get all that much attention before the Ukraine scandal and the subsequent House Democratic move towards impeachment, but the Republican Party, nationally and in the states, has been quietly working toward avoiding any unpleasantness surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s planned reelection gala in Charlotte next August. Four states \u2014 including two of the protected early states, Nevada and South Carolina, plus Kansas and Arizona \u2014 have formally cancelled their 2020 caucuses or primaries, and plan to award all delegates to the MAGA king. That wasn\u2019t unprecedented. As nominating contest maven Josh Putnam has noted, numerous states didn\u2019t bother to hold Republican primaries or caucuses when George W. Bush ran for reelection in 2004, and the same is true for Democrats during Barack Obama\u2019s reelection run of 2012. The idea is that states (or in the case of caucuses, state parties) shouldn\u2019t waste money on contests that are, well, no contest.\n\nBut neither Bush nor Obama had anything remotely like credible intra-party opponents, while Trump has two former governors (William Weld and Mark Sanford) and a former House member (Joe Walsh) publicly challenging his renomination. None of them have much traction at the moment, but rising impeachment sentiment (even among self-identified Republican voters) has to make Team Trump wonder if precautions are in order.\n\nThe canceled events aren\u2019t the only measures Republicans are taking to protect the incumbent, as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports:\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign helped orchestrate rule changes at party conventions in dozens of states, including Georgia, to weaken a potential GOP insurrection before it can start.\n\nThree senior Trump campaign officials said on a conference call Monday that they pressed party officials in 37 states to make it harder for a Republican primary opponent to emerge at the nominating convention in Charlotte in August 2020.\n\nThe key strategy is to monkey around with the proportional representation rules that Republicans introduced in 2016. Now states are being encouraged in order to let states move back towards winner-take-all or winner-take-most systems. Here\u2019s how it will work in Georgia:\n\nUnder the [new] rules, a candidate who wins a plurality of votes statewide automatically captures all of the statewide and at-large delegates. And the candidate who wins a plurality in each congressional district automatically captures all three delegates from the district.\n\nThe previous rules used in the 2016 election let candidates capture at least a handful of delegates if they won 20 percent of the vote statewide or, in some cases, if they finished in a strong second place in a congressional district.\n\nAs Putnam has noted, some state Republican parties have adopted rules that give candidates winning statewide majorities (as opposed to mere pluralities) winner-take-all awards. On a separate front, in 2018 the Republican National Committee abolished its debate-authorization commission. Wouldn\u2019t want to give any pesky Trump rivals a platform to gain attention, would we?\n\nIt\u2019s likely that these steps toward unanimity in the nominating process were motivated less by any fear that Trump might lose than by a desire to avoid the sort of divisive spectacle the party advertised in 2016, when Ted Cruz gave a big convention speech that did not include an endorsement of the nominee. Now that Trump truly controls the RNC, he can plan a convention that is, as his representatives have called it, a \u201cfour-day television commercial.\u201d Don\u2019t need any mixed messages when you\u2019re revving up the party base to smite the anti-American, anti-God, baby-killing socialists in what will likely be a close general election.", "description": "Even before the Ukraine scandal hit, Republicans were quietly rigging the 2020 nomination process for Trump, letting states cancel primaries and caucuses and making winner-take-all delegate awards easier.
