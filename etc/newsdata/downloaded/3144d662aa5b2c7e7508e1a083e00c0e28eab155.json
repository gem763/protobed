But Johnson added that there were \u201cclearly still gaps and still difficulties\u201d.\n\nAn EU official said last week talks were going nowhere.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know how to read what they are doing. If they are genuinely trying to open a negotiation, it would take them another 6-9 months to get to something. Or is it just tactical, and aimed at avoiding the blame?\u201d the official said.\n\nWith the outcome of the marathon Brexit process still uncertain, the opposition Labour Party will vote to decide its strategy on Monday, leader Jeremy Corbyn heading for a showdown with the widely pro-EU party membership over whether Labour should endorse a policy of remaining in the bloc.\n\nBREXIT IN PLAY?\n\nJohnson wants to remove the so-called backstop, which aims to avoid the return of controls along what would be Britain\u2019s only land border with the EU by having London follow the bloc\u2019s rules on trade, state aid, labour and environmental standards.\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution. Unless the Irish border backstop is removed or amended, Johnson will not be able to win parliamentary approval - but Ireland and the EU are loath to sign a deal without a solution to the border.\n\nAn open border is seen as vital to trade on the island of Ireland but to preserving the 1998 Good Friday accord that ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain last week shared technical documents with Brussels setting out its ideas for dealing with the backstop, although these were not the formal legal proposals Brussels has sought.\n\nJohnson has said he wants to secure an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18, and said \u201ca large number of the important players\u201d, including Britain, Germany, France and Ireland, wanted to reach an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe have seen interest in the idea of treating the island of Ireland as a single zone for sanitary and phytosanitary purposes that is also encouraging,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever there are clearly still gaps and still difficulties.\u201d\n\nJohnson said it was important the United Kingdom \u201cwhole and entire\u201d was able to break away from EU law in future.\n\n\u201cThe problem with ... the current backstop is that it would prevent the UK from diverging over a huge range of industrial standards and others,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may want to regulate differently but clearly there is also a strong incentive to keep goods moving fluidly and we think we can do both.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s government, worried the backstop will trap Britain in the EU\u2019s orbit for years to come, wants to remove it and find a solution before December 2020, when a planned transition period ends.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cautioned on Monday that there would be no Brexit breakthrough at talks with European leaders in New York as gaps remained, but said significant progress had been made on striking a deal.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432854886&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0DE", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
