But it hasn\u2019t been a distraction.\u2019\n\nWith the FA WSL title to defend and a return to the Champions League after five years, the manager\u2019s tasks in hand aren\u2019t easy.\n\nMontemurro guided Arsenal to their first league title for seven years in May\n\n\u2018We are definitely capable of winning titles but when it comes to winning back-to-back titles, it comes down to the little things,\u2019 the 22-year-old Roord added.\n\n\u2018You must really be a team, you must want to fight for each other and have a hunger to win every game. This Arsenal team definitely has that.\u2019\n\nThe 2018/19 champions are unbeaten in all competitions since the start of the season in September and Roord says she is relishing the fear much of the top-flight has for her north London team\u2019s attacking qualities.\n\nBut not all women\u2019s football is reaping the rewards of the World Cup boom, she says.\n\nThe United States are on the lookout for a replacement for iconic manager Jill Ellis\n\n\u2018I think the interest in [women\u2019s football] in Germany is going down,\u2019 she commented.\n\n\u2018In Germany and in Holland, you have two or three big games. In England you have to give 100 per cent and be focused in every game.\u2019", "description": "Joe Montemurro's links with the USA job have not been a distraction, midfielder Jill Roord insists as Arsenal prepare to face Chelsea at Kingsmeadow on Sunday.", "authors": ["Claire Bloomfield For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/20/19634722-0-image-a-9_1570910181077.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
