Yet many early reviews of the first three episodes are pretty \u2026 bad.\n\nAnd that\u2019s troubling, especially considering each episode of \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d costs Apple AAPL, +1.00% more than $15 million to make, according to a Financial Times report \u2014 that\u2019s more expensive than an episode of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d HBO\u2019s T, +4.28% bloody medieval drama ran between $6 million and $8 million per episode leading up to its final two seasons, when some installments began pushing the $15 million mark and beyond.\n\nVariety dubbed \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d a \u201cpolitically muddled, underthought, and underwhelming streaming misfire.\u201d The review mused that the show tries to take on too many provocative topics, including the #MeToo movement, the morning-show boys club, as well as what news coverage should and shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 in trying to sell all sides of its story without committing to telling a single one well, falls startlingly short,\u201d summed up Variety\u2019s Daniel D\u2019Addario. \u201cAnd, worst of all, there\u2019s not a human worth caring about in sight.\u201d\n\nTV Line graded it a C+ and wrote it off as \u201cpreachy, jumbled Sorkin lite,\u201d referring to Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the Emmy Award\u2013winning NBC CMCSA, -0.46% series \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and the HBO series \u201cThe Newsroom,\u201d which scored star Jeff Daniels a best-lead-actor Emmy.\n\nRolling Stone said the series \u201crises but doesn\u2019t shine\u201d despite an all-star cast. While it noted the show \u201cisn\u2019t terrible,\u201d and praised the performances of Billy Crudup, Witherspoon and Aniston, reviewer Alan Sepinwall complained that the show is a \u201cwell-polished snore.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter panned it as \u201cbroadcast snooze\u201d but added that it has potential. While the first two episodes see the series \u201cstruggling and floundering to find its focus, tone and attitude toward its main characters,\u201d Episode 3 hints at a \u201cmore satisfying and confident\u201d show down the line.\n\n\u201cDid the behemoths at Apple really get into the crowded original TV marketplace to become the latest perpetrator of \u2018It eventually gets better!\u2019 patience-testing?\u201d asked critic Daniel Feinberg.\n\nBut \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d does have some fans already in its corner.
