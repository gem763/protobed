And Goldwater deliberately ran on that difference: \u201cextremism in the defense of liberty is no vice\u201d was his rallying cry.\n\nWe were then only two years out from the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the world came closer to a nuclear Armageddon than at any other time\u2014and closer than anyone realized while it was happening.\n\nBut the Johnson campaign couldn\u2019t believe its luck. Goldwater backed up his claim to extremism by advocating the dropping of a \u201clow yield\u201d atomic bomb on the Chinese supply lines to the communists of North Vietnam. He called in John Wayne as a surrogate in commercials to stress his warrior virility. And he said, \u201cSometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, some guys on that Eastern Seaboard, at the hip Manhattan advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach, were to be his nemesis. They grabbed at Goldwater\u2019s readiness to use nukes by producing one of the most legendary campaign ads of all time, the so-called \u201cGirl with the Daisy.\u201d\n\nAn adorable three-year-old girl was seated in a field of daises picking her way through petals, counting them as they fell. This countdown merged with the countdown of an intercontinental ballistic missile being fired up and launched.\n\nAt the end of the countdown a close-up of the girl\u2019s eyes dissolved into the mushroom cloud of an atomic blast as lines from a Johnson campaign speech played over it: \u201cThese are the stakes, to make a world in which all of God\u2019s children can live, or go into the dark. We must either love each other or we must die.\u201d\n\nThe ad ran only once. There was an outcry\u2014quite justified\u2014that it exaggerated Goldwater\u2019s hawkishness. But once was enough to make it go viral, long before the phrase entered the lexicon. The network news shows re-ran it as they reported on the controversy and Time magazine put the girl on the cover.\n\nGoldwater\u2019s own TV ads all had the punchline \u201cIn your heart you know he\u2019s right.\u201d After the Girl with the Daisy episode Democratic wags added to the message by spreading the \u201cyou know he\u2019s nuts\u201d version, to much amusement. Johnson won by a landslide.\n\nBut behind that seemingly flippant line lay something really serious that was taking hold in the American psyche\u2014the fear of a deeper and long foretold threat, of an authoritarian despot ending up in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd now that that has finally happened we should ask ourselves: Who has most consistently tried to alert us to this outcome?\n\nNot the judiciary, not the Congress, and not the news media\u2014but Hollywood. This is arguably the outstanding example of a rare moment when popular culture discovered a gripping narrative that\u2019s also a powerful warning of future dangers to the republic.\n\nIn some of Goldwater\u2019s commercials he comes across in tone and text eerily like the villain of one of that year\u2019s best movies, the wonderfully named General James Mattoon Scott, played by Burt Lancaster, in Seven Days in May. Scott, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, is the ringleader of a covert military plot to replace a liberal president with a ruthless anti-communist hawk\u2014Scott himself.\n\nSeven Days in May was written by Rod Serling, based on the book by two reporters, Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey, who covered the Cuban Missile Crisis for Look magazine.\n\nThey had seen President Kennedy and his brother Robert, the attorney general, weigh how to react to the discovery that the Soviets had based nuclear-tipped missiles in Cuba, within striking distance of large swathes of the United States. Hawks in the Pentagon, led by the Air Force chief Curtis LeMay, wanted to bomb the bases and thought the Kennedys were not manning up but showing weakness that Moscow would exploit.\n\nThe Kennedys realized that one false step would inevitably end in a nuclear war. Robert Kennedy recalled: \u201cI thought, as I listened, of the many times I had heard the military take positions which, if wrong, had the advantage that no one would be around at the end to know.\u201d\n\nIn the event the Kennedy gamble, that a naval blockade of Cuba would force the Soviets to back down, worked\u2014but only at the last minute and after Kennedy secretly agreed with the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey.\n\nJohn Frankenheimer, the director of Seven Days in May, said that the Kennedys, through their press secretary Pierre Salinger, had urged that the film be made against advice from the Pentagon because it described a scenario, a military coup, that might actually happen.\n\nFrankenheimer was also the director of the mother of all presidential conspiracies, the 1962 movie The Manchurian Candidate in which the plot is not a right-wing coup but a communist conspiracy to plant a pliant puppet in the White House.\n\nThis is to be done by means that even Vladimir Putin could never have orchestrated, though he might well admire, involving an oedipal relationship played out on screen with a creepy reality by Angela Lansbury as the mother and Laurence Harvey as a son programmed to be an assassin.\n\nThis time the writer was the prolific political satirist Richard Condon, who declared that \u201cEvery book I\u2019ve ever written has been about abuse of power\u2026 I would like people to know how deeply their politicians wrong them.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1960s those fears of overarching power were always played out against the specter of the mushroom cloud. The Cold War strategy of mutually assured destruction, MAD, was sufficiently unnerving to amp up the horrors of any presidential conspiracy, whether it was neo-fascist or communist. And that was the theme of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s satirical masterpiece of the decade, Dr. Strangelove.\n\nA rogue Air Force general initiates a nuclear strike on Russia and makes sure it can\u2019t be aborted by the standard safety procedures. This throws both the Russian and American leaders into an urgent alliance to avert catastrophe. Three of the main characters, the American president, a British air force officer and Strangelove himself, a demented ex-Nazi nuclear strategist, are played by Peter Sellers.\n\nRather than suggest a wider conspiracy, Kubrick and the two writers, Terry Southern and Peter George, set out to show how easily the sum of all our fears could unfold through the actions of one all-too-plausible maniac. In a way, that makes it much more scary.\n\nBut it is a figure from 1979 who suddenly steps from a movie to become a precursor of our current gallery of White House grotesques: Chauncey Gardner, in the Hal Ashby movie Being There.\n\nIn this hilarious but also very dark comedy an idiot savant gardener named Chance glides, bemused, through a wave of accidental encounters until he ends up giving economic advice to a president. Confusion over his name and vocation produces his new identity, Chauncey Gardner, a man totally unequipped to be a potted plant, let alone a president and yet who, when the president dies, becomes a candidate to replace him.\n\nThis destiny emerges only in the movie\u2019s final scenes, where a casket containing a deceased president is carried to a mausoleum. In audible whispers the pallbearers, all members of the president\u2019s inner circle, decide that Chauncey, despite being a simpleton, should be installed in office because his TV ratings went through the roof.\n\nThose ratings were achieved on the basis of a primetime appearance in which, using the only kind of knowledge he possesses as a metaphor, Chauncey appears to be reassuring the nation that the economy, like a bush, will \u201cshow growth in the spring.\u201d\n\nAs it happened, Chauncey was the creation of two deeply troubled people.\n\nThe movie is based on a 1970 novel by Jerzy Kosinski, and also written by him. Late in his life Kosinski was accused of faking an autobiographical account of growing up in Poland as a fugitive from the Holocaust in a much-praised book, The Painted Bird. He killed himself in 1991, leaving that dispute and other parts of his racy social life to be argued over without conclusion.\n\nChauncey is played by Peter Sellers. As he demonstrated in Dr. Strangelove with his multiple roles, Sellers was a masterful chameleon, able to take on every nuance of a character, from the cold sober to the utterly deranged.\n\nUnfortunately, to those who knew him, the one thing Sellers could not be was a real person. One of his earliest directors, who acknowledged his comic genius, said, \u201cHe is a friend to nobody. I think he is a human being who has need of friendship but whose great tragedy is that he is incapable of the real sacrifices that flow from deep friendships.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it takes people as personally anguished as Kosinski and Sellers to invent such a convincingly accidental celebrity as Chauncey Gardner, who has turned out to serve as an uncanny predictor of how far the engine of celebrity can now take an entirely fabricated personality to the heights of power.\n\nHowever, it has to be admitted that the villains produced by our paranoia in the \u201960s and \u201970s seem comparatively simple now in their characterizations. They don\u2019t anticipate the sheer crazy velocity of a Twitter-driven news cycle commanded by a president.\n\nNor did those movies prepare us for the way this travesty of governance would be accepted so easily: Through the complicity of the Republican Party and through a wider collective apathy in the face of legislated bigotry and racism that echoes that of Germany in 1933.\n\nIn our brain we know he\u2019s insane\u2014but who is ready to deal with that, and how?", "description": "The world was haunted by the idea of nuclear war.
