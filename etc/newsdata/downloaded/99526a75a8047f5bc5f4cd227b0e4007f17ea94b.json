REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nBut impeach him now? Sibilla can see little upside.\n\n\u201cAfter this he has a much better chance of winning another election, as scary as that sounds,\u201d said Sibilla, 39, a resident of Pinellas County, Florida, who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s not even worth following because it\u2019s all going to help him.\u201d\n\nAlarmed by a whistleblower\u2019s revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives this week launched a formal impeachment inquiry into the Republican president.\n\nAmong the public, interviews with more than 60 voters across four of the most important counties in the 2020 election showed Republicans largely confident the impeachment process will backfire and Trump will win re-election. Democrats, on the other hand, are worried they may be right.\n\nMarc Devlin, a 48-year-old consultant from Northampton County, Pennsylvania, said he expects the inquiry to \u201cincense\u201d supporters of the president. \u201cThis is my fear, that it will actually add some flame to his fire with his base,\u201d he said. \u201cI just fear \u2018party over country.\u2019\u201d\n\nThroughout the 2020 election cycle, Reuters is monitoring voters in four areas that could determine the outcome of the Nov. 3 presidential contest: Pinellas County, Florida; Maricopa County, Arizona; Northampton County, Pennsylvania; and Racine County, Wisconsin.\n\nGiven the sharply divided electorate and the rules in America\u2019s state-by-state races that determine the winner in the Electoral College, those four states will be among the most targeted by presidential candidates next year.\n\nPublic opinion has time to shift before voters cast their ballots next November. But for now, the prospect of impeachment has done little to sway opinions, largely formed along party lines, according to the interviews and polling.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll taken on Monday and Tuesday showed 37% of respondents favored impeaching the president versus 45% who were opposed. That 37% figure was down from 41% three weeks earlier and down from 44% in May, after the release of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he did anything wrong,\u201d said Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 78, who runs a barber shop in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and cheers Trump\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nLee Snover, chair of the Northampton County Republican Committee, said she felt the impeachment inquiry was the latest instance of the Democrats using unfair tactics to try to take Trump down. It showed, she said, how disconnected Washington\u2019s politicians are from the country.\n\n\u201cI have not had one Republican crack or say they\u2019re turning or going the other way. They\u2019re laughing it off. I think it\u2019s going to help him,\u201d said Snover, 50.\n\nThat sentiment was shared at a meeting of College Republicans United at Arizona State University on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThey have this idea that everyone is siding with them, that Trump is an impeachable president, when really it\u2019s only a minority,\u201d Rose Mulet, 19, said of the Democratic leadership in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reflection of the general public.\u201d\n\nMoreover, odds of impeachment succeeding are long. None of America\u2019s 45 presidents have even been removed that way. Though the Democrats control the House of Representatives, where they need a simple majority of votes, the Senate, controlled by Republicans, would have to vote with a two-thirds majority to remove the president from office.\n\nThat reality has only frustrated Democrats angered by what they see as a string of offenses by Trump, from bragging about grabbing women by the genitals to Mueller\u2019s conclusion that Trump interfered with his probe.\n\n\u201cI am enraged,\u201d said Barbara Lebak, a 66-year-old librarian who was working her way through a crossword puzzle from a bench in Racine County, Wisconsin.\n\nLike Lebak, fellow Racine County resident David Ferrell, 56, said he saw multiple reasons to impeach Trump, including what he called the president\u2019s hardline policies on immigration and inflammation of race relations.\n\n\u201cWhat has taken so long? It should have been done long ago,\u201d said Ferrell. \u201cI\u2019m voting for a Democrat, no matter who it is.\u201d\n\nWhile polls and interviews suggest most voters are solidly entrenched, some, like Chris Harman, have been swayed.\n\nHarman, 52, who works in sales and marketing in Maricopa County, said he voted for Trump in 2016 but will not in 2020. He said the president had already committed impeachable offenses even before the Ukraine scandal erupted.\n\n\u201cIt should have been done a long time ago,\u201d Harman said as he left a baseball game in Phoenix. \u201cI\u2019m not voting for Trump. I tried it, it was a grand experiment, but I\u2019m not going to try it again.\u201d\n\n(The story refiles to add dropped word in first paragraph)", "description": "Having his morning coffee and cigarette outside a Starbucks in one of the most politically contested counties in the United States, Richard Sibilla recoils at the memory of President Donald Trump's election.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434323777&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P25J", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
