Trump made it clear that he didn\u2019t trust Democrats and feared they would compromise the mission; as a result, he broke with established precedent and only briefed select members of his own party ahead of the Baghdadi operation.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was inappropriate that the Russians had learned of the operation before Congress, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he learned of Baghdadi\u2019s death from watching television.\n\nCompare Trump\u2019s tone to Obama\u2019s when he announced the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Obama took no questions, was calm and measured and referred to the importance of overcoming terrorism by adhering to American values.\n\nBy contrast, Trump referred proudly to his administration\u2019s ban on travelers from certain Muslim-majority countries. \u201cWe have a very effective ban, and it\u2019s very hard for people to come to our country,\u201d Trump said. And, in another act of politics and partisanship, he arranged to have Sen. Lindsey Graham go to the White House briefing room to deliver the administration\u2019s talking points.", "description": "", "authors": ["Miller", "Cnn.Com Opinions Trump-Is-Preparing-To-Squander-His-Al-Baghdadi-Victory-Miller-Sokolsky Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
