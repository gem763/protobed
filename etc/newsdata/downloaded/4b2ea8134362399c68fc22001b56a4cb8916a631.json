Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee and Eliot Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee \u2013 wrote in a letter to colleagues Thursday. \u201cIt is unethical, unpatriotic, and wrong. American Presidents should never press foreign powers to target their domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nThe text messages released by Volker to Congress show U.S. officials involved with Ukraine arguing internally last month over whether Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo. \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine Bill Taylor said in one text exchange in a chain with Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.\n\nBut Sondland pushed back. \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind.\u201d\n\nVolker, who was Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, abruptly resigned his post as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations last week. He voluntarily gave a deposition on Thursday before a House committee as part of the House Democratic impeachment inquiry.\n\nVolker resigned last week after his name surfaced in a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Hunter Biden, his father and the company Burisma. Biden\u2019s son was a Burisma board director until departing before Joe Biden announced his campaign for the presidency in April.\n\nFox News on Friday also obtained Volker\u2019s prepared testimony to lawmakers on the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees. In it, he details his interactions with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was probing whether Burisma had sought to garner influence with Biden by paying high fees to his son. He also said he didn\u2019t find then-Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko, who he said was fueling those accusations about the Bidens, \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn May, 2019, I learned that former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani planned to travel to Ukraine to look into these accusations,\u201d Volker said. \u201cI reached out to brief him before his visit \u2013 specifically, to tell him that Lutsenko is not credible and will be replaced once a new government takes office.\u201d\n\nIn his testimony, Volker sought to distance himself from any investigation, saying, \u201cat no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.\u201d He also defended Biden\u2019s integrity, saying, \u201cI have known former Vice President Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me.\"\n\nStill, the source familiar with Volker\u2019s transcribed interview said the diplomat told lawmakers he didn\u2019t believe a Ukrainian-led investigation related to Burisma or 2016 election interference, as Trump has also pressed for, would be improper. Volker also said he believes Trump's concerns about Ukrainian corruption were valid, the source said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel and Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine\u00a0Kurt Volker told lawmakers during closed-door testimony Thursday that the Ukrainians never indicated concerns to him about President Trump pursuing a quid pro quo -- linking military aid to an investigation of Joe Biden --\u00a0a source familiar with Volker\u2019s transcribed interview told Fox News.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is A Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/04/694940094001_6092110144001_6092107363001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
