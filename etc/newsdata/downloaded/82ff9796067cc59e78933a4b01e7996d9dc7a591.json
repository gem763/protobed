My only thing is that they need to win big tournaments,\u201d Ganguly, president-elect of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, told reporters in Kolkata.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they need to win every time. It\u2019s not possible. But we have gone through seven big tournaments without winning one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are a much better side than that. That is the only area where they need to get themselves ready mentally.\n\n\u201cTalent is enormous, otherwise they couldn\u2019t have played so well in the World Cup till the semi-finals. So that\u2019s an issue which Virat needs to address. And that doesn\u2019t happen in the boardroom.\u201d\n\nIndia topped the group stage at this year\u2019s 50-overs World Cup but were beaten by New Zealand in the semi-finals.\n\nAs he completes his transition from a star player to a top administrator, one of Ganguly\u2019s initial tasks would be to decide the future of Dhoni, who has taken a break from international cricket after the World Cup in England.\n\nWhile many believe the popular stumper should not be pushed into retirement, others want clarity about the future of the 38-year-old.\n\n\u201cWe will have to see what Dhoni wants,\u201d Ganguly said of his former team mate.\n\n\u201cNow I will be in a position to find out and then we\u2019ll decide on the way forward.\u201d", "description": "India's Virat Kohli is captaining an enormously talented team, but the players need to adjust their mentality to win big tournaments, having failed in the last seven, ex-captain Sourav Ganguly said as he prepares to head the national cricket board.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441760946&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0DX", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
