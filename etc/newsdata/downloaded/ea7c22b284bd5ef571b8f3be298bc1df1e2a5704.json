However Trudeau fell short of a majority, so the Liberals would have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation\n\nHis early morning address to supporters came, unusually, as his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer, had just begun speaking to his own supporters, forcing networks to tear away from Scheer\u2019s speech.\n\nBut the prime minister struck a conciliatory note: \u201cTo those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you, we will govern for everyone,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nWith results still trickling in early Tuesday, the Liberals had 157 seats \u2014 13 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons \u2014 while the Conservatives had 121.\n\nStill, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party won fewer raw votes nationally than the Conservatives did, and his party failed to win a single seat in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan where the Conservatives dominated.\n\nThe prime minister showed up at a Montreal subway station on Tuesday morning to greet Canadians and take selfies.\n\nTrudeau said Canadians rejected division and negativity and elected a progressive agenda.\n\nBut in what was supposed to be a concession speech, the Conservative leader Scheer said the results showed Trudeau was much weakened since his 2015 election, when pundits had predicted the beginning of another Trudeau dynasty after a decade of Conservative government.\n\n\u201cConservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cAnd Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d\n\nTrudeau delivered an unexpectedly strong result despite a series of scandals that tarnished his image as a liberal icon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as 2015,\u201d when Trudeau first took offce. \u201cIt\u2019s not all owing to the leader,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto.\n\n\u201cTrudeau is prime minister because the rest of the party was able to pull itself together and prevail. While Trudeau certainly deserves credit for what has happened he\u2019s really going to have to demonstrate qualities that he hasn\u2019t yet shown.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s clean-cut image had taken a hit after old photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at how well Trudeau has done,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority, but they are not that far off.\u201d\n\nPerhaps sensing Trudeau was in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau. The son of liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is one of the few remaining progressive world leaders in the Trump era.\n\nThe unassuming Scheer, 40, is a career politician who was seen as a possible antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash. But Bothwell said late Monday that he expected Scheer to resign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Bothwell said. \u201cHe ran a really dirty campaign. There is nothing to be proud of on his side. He had the opportunity and blew it.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, Scheer called Trudeau a phony who couldn\u2019t even remember how many times he had worn blackface.\n\nScheer suggested he would try to stay on as leader, saying that holding Trudeau to a minority was the first step toward restrong a Conservative government.\n\nTrudeau also was hurt by a scandal this year when his former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals will likely rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and pass legislation. Opposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh said early Tuesday he had congratulated Trudeau and vowed to play a constructive role in Parliament.\n\nTrudeau embraced immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.\n\nHis efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta\u2019s oil to international markets.\n\nHis also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap it.\n\nTrump, who has clashed with Trudeau over trade, tweeted his congratulations early Tuesday, saying, \u201cCanada is well served.\u201d", "description": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in Canada's national elections, losing the majority but saying Tuesday he was given a clear", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/22/047c4b_aptopix-canada-election-liberals-22419-liberal-leader-justin-trudeau-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
