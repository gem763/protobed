Mr. Salvini was also known for his hard-line immigration policies and for leaning toward Russia and the authoritarian style of its president and away from Italy\u2019s traditional European and Atlantic allies.\n\nStill, the setback to the League and its far-right allies was a relief for the European Union and for moderate forces across the Continent. Some of Mr. Salvini\u2019s harsher anti-migrant policies are likely to be toned down by the new interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, a specialist in migration issues. And a member of the European Parliament, Roberto Gualtieri, was named economy minister, with the critical task of drafting a budget for 2020. Mr. Conte declared that the new government would be less contentious than his previous one. \u201cWe must recover sobriety and rigor so that our citizens can see renewed confidence in our institutions,\u201d he said on resuming his duties.\n\nIt would be unduly rosy to depict the Italian Parliament\u2019s brake on Mr. Salvini, a populist seeking \u201cfull powers,\u201d as solely an altruistic defense of democracy \u2014 many members also risked losing their seats in new elections. But it was the second time in a week \u2014 following the British Parliament\u2019s rejection of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to sneak in a no-deal Brexit by suspending the legislature \u2014 that a European legislature rose up to block a strong leader from going too far. That is something legislators in other states challenged by populist strongmen, including the United States, should take to heart.\n\nThe l oud chants on Monday of \u201cElections! Elections!\u201d from Mr. Salvini\u2019s supporters in the Parliament chamber and on the streets outside confirmed that the League and its leader were not yet finished. But for the moment, power was in the hands of a law professor who argued that absent mutual respect, democracy risks becoming \u201conly the mask of a new tyranny.\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
