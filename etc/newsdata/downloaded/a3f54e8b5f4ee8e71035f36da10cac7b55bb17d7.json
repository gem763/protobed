The memo is from the whole team.\"\n\n\"The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind,\" he said in the 2017 letter. \"They simply can't be done in a day or two.\"\n\n\"[It] is harder for the author, but it forces the author to clarify their own thinking,\" he said at the Forum on Leadership. \"It totally revolutionizes the way we do meetings at Amazon.\"\n\nLike this story?
