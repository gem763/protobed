Just about to watch Ireland play New Zealand.\n\n\u2018Massive game, quarter-final of the World Cup. Obviously hoping Ireland win, they\u2019ve never been past the quarter-finals of a World Cup, so big night for everyone. Come on Ireland!\u2019\n\nHenshaw did get his try just a few moments later, though the side were still 27 points behind with just 11 minutes to play and with no chance of mounting a comeback.\n\nHenshaw did eventually score, but it was too little too late for Ireland (Picture: Getty)\n\nNew Zealand were in no mood to let their foot off the gas and responded immediately with another try of their own.\n\nThey did give away a late penalty try, though, when CJ Stander was held up illegally at the line, with Matt Todd shown a yellow card.\n\nBut even with 14 men the All Blacks were still too powerful, adding a seventh try through Jordie Barrett to round off a totally dominant performance, and they will take on England in the semi-final next weekend.", "description": "Rory McIlroy summed up the reaction of many Ireland fans when he burst out laughing at a handling error that denied his side a try in Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rory-McIlroy-2f20_1571488694.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
