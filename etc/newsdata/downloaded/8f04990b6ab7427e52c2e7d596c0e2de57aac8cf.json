It is now vital that we do not waste this extension as we want to get a good [Brexit] deal done.\u201d\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \u201cUncertainty remains high. It is vital \u2014 this time \u2014 the extra time leads to a deal.\u201d\n\nAdam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said companies will be \u201crelieved that the immediate threat of a messy and disorderly departure has been avoided this week, and frustrated that they still do not have a permanent solution that allows them to invest, trade and plan for the future\u201d.\n\nA survey by the BCC found that almost half of internationally active UK businesses considered Brexit uncertainty a barrier to exports.\n\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, pointed to \u201can underlying sense of frustration and anger\u201d at \u201ccostly, wasted preparations\u201d for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe timescale ahead is challenging,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is critical that we do not find ourselves, in January, once again facing the precipice, having spent millions of pounds preparing for a no-deal exit three times in the past 12 months.\u201d\n\nNimisha Raja, founder of Nim\u2019s Fruit Crisps, a snack manufacturer based in Sittingbourne, Kent, said she has put on hold any type of export contract to mainland Europe because of Brexit uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added that unlike in the run-up to the March 29 Brexit deadline, she had not stockpiled ingredients ahead of October 31. \u201cI am just fed up with it all,\u201d she said.\n\nBusiness lobby groups are pressing the government to provide greater clarity not just over the withdrawal agreement but also the UK\u2019s long term trading relationship with the EU.\n\nGroups had been planning to use this week to talk to the government about the next Budget, which the Treasury shelved last week having previously scheduled it for November 6.\n\nThe head of a smaller British retailer said the uncertainty engendered by the latest Brexit delay \u201cwas not good for business at all\u201d, adding the high street would also be hurt by an election ahead of Christmas.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want is an election in December,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just distracts everyone. Historically, elections have not been good for retailers, they really slow consumers down and trading is very challenging already.\u201d\n\nGary Grant, founder of the Entertainer, a chain of toy stores, agreed an election would be unwelcome. \u201cI\u2019m probably as confused as everyone else [by Brexit] . . . as a business leader I need to know what I\u2019m planning for,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather delay than leave with a bad deal.\u201d\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Companies have responded to the uncertainty by holding off on investment plans, and manufacturers notably have stockpiled components for fear of border disruption in a no-deal Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2664%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4b2a6be52144c92e626b44135d4dbc8567a601d0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
