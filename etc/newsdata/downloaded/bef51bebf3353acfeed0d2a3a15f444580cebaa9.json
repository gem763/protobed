(AP) - For the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, the first three weeks of the season appear to have all the significance of an NFL preseason.\n\nTwo dominant victories against overmatched opponents.\n\nAnother game Saturday against a big underdog.\n\nTo those on the outside, it looks like nothing more than a precursor to the start of the real season on Sept. 21, when No. 7 Notre Dame plays between the hedges for the first time.\n\nBut Georgia coach Kirby Smart scoffed at any suggestion that his team is peeking ahead a bit to the Fighting Irish as it prepares to host 32-point underdog Arkansas State.\n\n\u201cNobody in our building is going to be working on Notre Dame this week,\u201d Smart said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s not our focus. I have too much respect for this team and too much respect for how they play.\u201d\n\nGeorgia opened the season with a 30-6 blowout of fellow Southeastern Conference school Vanderbilt and followed up with a 63-17 shellacking of FCS school Murray State this past weekend, a game that little more than a glorified scrimmage.\n\nThe oddsmakers are predicting another easy victory against the Red Wolves (1-1), who are members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nSmart, of course, doesn\u2019t want his players taking anything for granted.\n\nSo he did his best to make Arkansas State sound like something of a cross between Clemson and Alabama.\n\n\u201cThis is a really, really good football team,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThey do a tremendous job offensively and defensively, and you could see that last night right when we flipped the page to look at them. They\u2019ve got some really good defensive players - explosive, quick. They lead their conference in a lot of categories. I have a lot of respect for their quarterback. They\u2019ve got the best wideouts and skill guys we have probably faced when it comes to a combination of three or four really good receivers. They have a lot of experience up front, a lot of returning guys.\u201d\n\nBut Smart left something out.\n\nWhile Arkansas State has certainly built a successful Group of Five program, winning five conference titles and earning eight straight bowl bids over the past decade, they have lost 20 straight games against current members of the Power Five - most by big margins.\n\nSince an 18-14 upset of Texas A&M; in 2010, the Red Wolves have lost eight in a row to SEC schools by a cumulative margin of 335-114.\n\nBut coaches are good at coachspeak, so Smart went to work building up the Red Wolves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look past today,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when these guys turn on the tape like we did last night, we don\u2019t ever lie to our players, we say \u2018this is what it is and here it is for you to see, you be the judge.\u2019 We did that last week and we\u2019re going to do it this week. The tape speaks for itself this week. This is a really good football team.\u201d\n\nHis players were reticent to even mention the name of that school from South Bend.\n\n\u201cJust worry about the team we\u2019re playing now,\u201d defensive end David Marshall said. There aren\u2019t \u201ctoo many other people who talk about, uhh, other teams like that on campus.\u201d\n\nSomeone pointed out that Marshall had done a good job of staying away those two dirty words - Notre Dame.\n\nHe merely smiled.\n\nMuch like an NFL exhibition, the last game did serve at least one useful purpose for the Bulldogs: a bunch of young players got a chance to gain valuable playing experience.\n\nRedshirt freshman Zamir White led the team with 72 yards on eight carries and scored his first college touchdown. Freshman Kenny McIntosh rushed for 61 yards on nine carries. Freshman George Pickens set the receiving pace with four catches for 78 yards, including his first TD as well as a spectacular 43-yard reception. Backup quarterback Stetson Bennett got into a Division I game for the first time, completing 9 of 13 for 124 yards and two scores, though the Racers did return an interception to the end zone.\n\nAll those guys could be line for significant playing time again Saturday if the Bulldogs build another big lead.\n\nAfter that, it\u2019s time to get serious.\n\nThat\u2019s when the season begins in earnest.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, the first three weeks of the season appear to have all the significance of an NFL preseason.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/murray_st_georgia_football_97648_c0-199-4767-2978_s1770x1032.jpg?f46a704e463e1f6ffa5f06d6932bb37680b14249", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
