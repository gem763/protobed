But they must show that every time they play, that they have the level to play for Madrid. Today we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe must be more consistent if we are to do anything good this year, have more life in our play. Today we didn\u2019t have that. \u201cOur start to the game was very bad.\n\n\u201cIn second half we did not create many clear chances, we lacked a bit of everything today.\u201d\n\nWILD CELEBRATIONS\n\nIt was no smash and grab raid by Vicente Moreno\u2019s Mallorca who produced a tenacious display full of energy to beat Real for the first time since 2006, sparking wild celebrations.\n\nMoreno led Mallorca back to La Liga via the playoffs in June and after an opening day win they have found it tough.\n\nBut they backed up their win over Espanyol before the international break with a performance that will fuel belief they can survive.\n\n\u201cWe have achieved in the two previous years more important things than winning one game,\u201d Moreno told reporters. \u201cThree points was vital, regardless of the opponent.\n\n\u201cWe played the game we had to do. There were times we lacked peace of mind and suffered, but in the end we had some luck. Everything has come together and from time to time you win.\u201d\n\nMadrid began casually and were rocked when Lago Junior cut in from the left and lashed a right-footed shot across Thibaut Courtois and inside the far post.\n\nThe home fans were in delirium soon afterwards when top scorer Ante Budimir thought he had made it 2-0 by thumping a shot past Courtois but the goal was rightly ruled offside.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nKarim Benzema struck the woodwork for Madrid before halftime with a half volley and Brazilian Vinicius Jr threatened with his pace, although there was no end product.\n\nWith James Rodr\u00edguez and Isco making little impact the expected second-half siege failed to materialise and Madrid played the last 15 minutes with 10 men after Alvaro Odriozola received a second yellow card for a reckless foul that summed up their night.\n\nMallorca held firm with relative ease for their third victory since returning to the top flight following a six-year absence. They moved up to 14th with 10 points while Real are second, one point behind Barcelona.", "description": "Real Madrid's unbeaten start to the La Liga season came to an abrupt and surprising end as Real Mallorca claimed a stunning 1-0 victory at a rocking Son Moix on Saturday to climb out of the relegation zone.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442786952&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0LO", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
