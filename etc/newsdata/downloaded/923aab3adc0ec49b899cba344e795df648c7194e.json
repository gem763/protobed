This means that an iPhone's useful lifespan, before users might notice a performance drop and buy a new device (or at least replace the battery), should be longer.\n\nThe new built-in systems are \"automatic\" and \"always-on\" to keep the iPhone 11 phones running at their best as their batteries degrade over time, the company said.\n\nNot perfect\n\nStill, even Apple admits that the new built-in systems aren't perfect.\n\n\"While performance impacts are reduced as much as possible, battery aging might still eventually lead to noticeable, possibly temporary, effects,\" Apple said. Some of those effects include \" longer app launch times, lower frame rates, reduced wireless-data throughput, backlight dimming, or lower speaker volume.\"\n\nTo be sure, smartphone batteries degrade over time without exception.\n\nApple is being transparent about its the new built-in systems in the iPhone 11 after a late 2017 controversial discovery that iPhones would automatically throttle down their performance as their battery health degraded.\n\nThe discovery was the source of major controversy, as iPhone users weren't aware that the performance throttling was caused by poor battery health. Many claimed they would have replaced their batteries for significantly less cost than buying a new device when their iPhone's performance turned sluggish, had they known the cause was likely a deteriorated battery.\n\nApple subsequently offered an option in iOS 11.3 to manually stop an iPhone from throttling its performance, even if its battery health had degraded. It also offered a steep discount on iPhone battery replacements for a limited time.\n\nApple then ditched the manual performance throttling option as of the iOS 12.1 software update, and with the 2017 iPhone 8 and iPhone X generation, the 2018 iPhone XS generation, and now the iPhone 11 generation.\n\nSeeing as the iPhone 11 phones were only released on Friday, we have no way of telling yet how well Apple's new built-in systems work to manage performance as the battery degrades.", "description": "Apple's new built-in systems manage the iPhone 11's performance better than any previous iPhone, Apple said, and it can", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8554942e22af4f632f09d7-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
