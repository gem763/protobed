The best performer was the NASDAQ, which managed a gain of only 0.07% (or about 5 points) to 8182.88.\n\n\n\nThe S&P broke even but technically inched higher by 0.06 of a point to 3006.79.\n\n\n\nThe really lost its way and finished lower by 0.19% (or about 52 points) to 27,094.79.\n\n\n\nStocks had a muted reaction the past two days to the Fed cutting rates by another quarter-point. The result was too widely expected and Chair Jerome Powell didn\u2019t go overboard on dovishness.\n\n\n\nSometimes, the market needs to sleep on it before really rallying. But not this time! The decision and comments from the Fed meeting proved to be anticlimactic and weren't enough to break the market out of its range.\n\n\n\nFortunately, despite today\u2019s sluggishness, the indices still have a good chance of putting together another winning week.\n\n\n\nThe NASDAQ goes into Friday\u2019s session higher over the past 4 days, while the Dow and S&P are only down by 0.5% and 0.02%, respectively.\n\n\n\nA strong close tomorrow would mark the fourth straight week in the green, which would be a nice response to the four-week losing streak that dominated most of August.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re still pretty close to new highs as well, with the Dow and S&P each less than 1% from making history.\n\n\n\nBut if the Fed isn\u2019t going to help stocks pick the right direction, then it may be up to the next big events for the market.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, trade talks and earnings season are a lot more unpredictable than the Fed.\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nCounterstrike: With the market approaching all-time highs, Jeremy wanted to make a few changes to the portfolio. He added 4% allocations to Paycom (PAYC) and Smartsheet (SMAR) each. These stocks were both originally added on September 11 during the rotation out of momentum. PAYC never had to test its 200-day and SMAR is above its 200-day and seemingly on its way to surpassing its 50-day.

Kevin added this cloud-based communication platforms company on Thursday with a 7% allocation. It's growing sales by more than 70% this year to over $1 billion, while trading at only 10X next year's $1.5B consensus. The editor had this one on his \"buy list\" closer to $100 but was inspired to act today by an upgrade from a major brokerage who sees TWLO\u2019s tools and improvements as the \u201cnext leading wave of customer service and engagement\u201d. He thinks TWLO might be able to reach its 50-day near $130 soon.

This company is an IT services name that the editor really likes right now. First of all, it has an excellent history of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate, having done so for four straight quarters with an average surprise of around 7%. Also, PRSP is enjoying rising earnings estimates, which underscores its status as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). But Brian really appreciated its topline growth of 39% on sales of only 1x sales. The editor expects this name to roll over the 52-week high in short order.
