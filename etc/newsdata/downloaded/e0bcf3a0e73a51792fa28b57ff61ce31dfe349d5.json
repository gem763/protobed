Grand final today 18.00. Expect delays.\"\n\nOld Trafford has generally not exactly been a thrilling place to be at so far this season. Since United's 4-0 victory over Chelsea on the first day of the Premier League season Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have scored just five goals in five games in all competitions, and they have attracted criticism for their slow, unexciting brand of football.\n\nThis is not the first time those in charge of the traffic signs have been up to mischief. Last season before United's Champions League game against Barcelona they couldn't resist a few puns, with the sign reading: \"Pique time will be Messi. Consider using tram of bus,\" while ahead of their game against West Ham it had a message saying: \"Utd need 3 points, but you don't!! Please slow down.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nMan United are next in action at Old Trafford when they take on their bitter rivals Liverpool after the international break on Sunday October 20, with Solskjaer's job on the line following a run of just one win from their last five games.", "description": "The sign pokes fun at the club's recent poor form and lack of goals", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Action Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541425.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Huddersfield-Town-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
