His backing of Hong Kong democracy protests was rebuked by the NBA, sparking a backlash.\n\nTrump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, spoke in generally upbeat terms about this week's discussions with China, the first such high-level talks in more than two months, but Trump insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal.\n\n\"We think there's a chance we could do something very substantial,\" Trump said, referring to minister-level talks scheduled for the end of the week. \"I would much prefer a big deal and I think that's what we're shooting for.\"\n\nPressed to elaborate on the chances of progress this week, Trump sounded more skeptical. \"Can something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows. But I think it's probably unlikely,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, on Tuesday said the talks could go three ways, namely both sides reaching a \"fair\" deal; the talks completely falling apart; or maintaining the state of \"talking while retaliating\".\n\n\"We will strive for a good outcome, but will also not force it,\" the newspaper said on its official WeChat account.\n\nThe post noted recent developments showed the U.S. side has yet to give up its \"maximum pressure\" negotiating tactics.\n\nIt added China has made \"sufficient and appropriate\" response plans if the talks completely collapse, without elaborating.\n\nTrump also said he hoped China found a humane and peaceful resolution to the protests in Hong Kong, and warned the situation had the potential to hurt trade talks.\n\n\"If anything happened bad, I think that would be a very bad thing for the negotiation. I think politically it would be very tough,\" he told reporters at the White House.\n\nPolice in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.\n\nBeijing views U.S. support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong as interfering with its sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS IN MONTHS\n\nU.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators on Monday launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way for the first minister-level negotiations in months.\n\nThe White House officially confirmed that the high-level talks, involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, would begin on Thursday.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said Vice Premier Liu He would travel to Washington for trade talks with the United States on Thursday and Friday.\n\nIn a brief statement posted on the ministry's website, it also said Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, central bank Governor Yi Gang, and the National Development and Reform Commission's deputy head Ning Jizhe would attend the talks.\n\nThe talks are getting underway about a week before U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise to 30% from 25%. Trump has said the tariff increase will take effect on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies' access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nTrump launched a new round of tariffs after the last high-level talks in late July failed to result in agricultural purchases or yield progress on substantive issues. China quickly responded with tariff increases of its own.\n\nAs Monday's talks got underway, the U.S. Agriculture Department reported more soybean exports to China, the latest in a recent flurry of buying by Beijing. China has booked deals for about 3.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans since early September.", "description": "Prospects for progress in U.S.-China trade talks dimmed on Monday after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing's treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities, and President Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely.
