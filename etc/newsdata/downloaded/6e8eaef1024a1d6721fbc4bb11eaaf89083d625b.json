Dog also addressed it in an interview with SurvivorNet. While the cannabis didn't cure her cancer, it made her final days more manageable.\n\n\"The day that we started the cannabis treatment, [Beth] hadn\u2019t eaten for nine days. The next day, after two doses, she woke up in the morning and said, 'Honey, I\u2019m hungry.' The CBD and the cannabis let her move, let her talk, let her think. It didn\u2019t kill the cancer, but it did lessen the blow.\"\n\nCannabis Gave Her The Ability To Enjoy Her Life\n\nBeth explained how the cannabis helped her in the latest episode of Dog's Most Wanted, saying:\n\n\"I definitely am able to eat if I stay on it, and I can sleep. If I don\u2019t take it, I\u2019m awake.\"\n\nBeth didn't respond to the chemotherapy, so the cannabis helped her function. She explained that while the treatment may have helped other people, it wasn't the right course of treatment for her.\n\n\"Chemotherapy is not my bag, people. Sorry, that\u2019s not for me. So for me, this is the ultimate test of faith. This is my ultimate lesson. And it will either be taught to me or to you. And I am fine with taking the hit for everyone else. Because I think I know another guy who did the same thing.\"\n\nChemo Wasn't For Her\n\nIn his interview, Dog explained that he supported Beth's decision 100%.", "description": "Medical cannabis helped bring comfort to Beth in her final days.", "authors": ["Lynne Versluys"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ti8h3cYeMuo1J9euPiodJg--~B/aD0zNDAyO3c9MzY2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/937f6f5a0a2da12ec8b1085429cd7e4f", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
