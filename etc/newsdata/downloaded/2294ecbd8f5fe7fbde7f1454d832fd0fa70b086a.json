It\u2019s about that President Trump doesn\u2019t like the way these two papers cover him, as he makes clear all the time.\u201d\n\nIn a Thursday email to The Wall Street Journal, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham claimed that the cancellations \u2015 which may be encouraged across all agencies \u2015 would save \u201chundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately reply to HuffPost\u2019s inquiry on the basis for that calculation.\n\nThough Kurtz noted that President John F. Kennedy, in an act of apparent retaliation over The New York Herald Tribune\u2019s coverage, canceled the White House\u2019s subscription to the paper in 1962, \u201cto extend it to all federal departments and agencies, I think, is a bit petty,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview that aired Monday night with network opinion host Sean Hannity, Trump derided the Times as \u201ca fake newspaper,\u201d stating that \u201cwe don\u2019t even want it in the White House anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re fake.\u201d\n\nBoth outlets have become notorious targets of the president\u2019s endless ire for their scoops on the inner workings of his administration, which Trump frequently claims are phony.\n\nKurtz\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s move is notable as the anchor is one of Fox News\u2019 few remaining moderates who continue to challenge the president \u2015 a group that has only shrunken with the recent departure of Shepard Smith.\n\nWhile the network is known to be Trump\u2019s preferred outlet for interviews and news consumption \u2015 much of which is favorable to his administration \u2015 the president has taken aim at its reporting throughout the past year, frustrated that its 2020 election polls haven\u2019t placed him in a more promising position.\n\nIn August, Kurtz publicly defended Fox News\u2019 data, tweeting that he and the outlet have made \u201cevery effort to be fair to a POTUS much maligned by the media.\u201d", "description": "Howard Kurtz said the White House's refusal to renew subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post is \"a symbolic slap.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db349492100007531ad3eda.jpeg?cache=5ayhobufq7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
