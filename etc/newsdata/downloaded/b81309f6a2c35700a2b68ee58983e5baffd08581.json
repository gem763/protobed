Jurgen Klopp has been impressed with Elliot since he joined from Fulham in the summer and is ready to unleash him on Wednesday night.\n\nElliot became the club's youngest player \u2013 at 16 years and 174 days \u2013 to start a competitive game when he made his debut in the Carabao Cup third round tie at MK Dons last month.\n\nThe 16-year-old was a constant thorn in the side of the League One side and showed glimpses of real class. He will ask plenty of questions of Arsenal's defence.\n\nHarvey Elliot is primed to make his first appearance at Anfield for their cup clash with Arsenal\n\nNeco Williams - Liverpool\n\nNeco Williams is an unfamiliar name to most, but inside the Melwood walls he is well known as one of Liverpool's brightest prospects.\n\nThe 18-year-old has caught Klopp's eye since being called up to train with the first team earlier this year and is now expected to make his professional debut at right-back on Wednesday night.\n\nKi-Jana Hoever would likely have started against Arsenal, but Williams has been drafted in with the Dutchman away on international duty at the Under-17 World Cup. Can he make the most of the opportunity?\n\nNeco Williams has come out of nowhere to be drafted in to Liverpool's squad for Wednesday\n\nGabriel Martinelli - Arsenal\n\nThe Brazilian striker has hit the ground running since moving to Arsenal in the summer.\n\nWith the likes of Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang knocking about, breaking into the first team was always going to be a challenge. But Martinelli has performed so well, he has given Unai Emery food for thought.\n\nHe has scored three times in the Europa League and twice in the Carabao Cup already this season. The 18-year-old is quickly maturing into a deadly forward and will be a handful for Liverpool on Wednesday night.\n\nThe 18-year-old has been a prominent figure for Arsenal in cup competitions this season\n\nEmile Smith Rowe - Arsenal\n\nEmile Smith Rowe it feels like has been around for years now.\n\nStill only 19, the midfielder is expected to be exposed to more first-team action this season. He has already played twice in Europe and once in this competition so far and will most likely feature against Liverpool.\n\nAlthough he is well thought of by those at Arsenal, Smith Rowe remains on the fringes of the first team. A good performance on Wednesday though, and Emery may just consider giving him a shot against Wolves this weekend.\n\nEmile Smith-Rowe is expected to feature against Liverpool on Wednesday evening\n\nASTON VILLA VS WOLVES\n\nJacob Ramsey - Aston Villa\n\nThe midfielder has caught the eye of Dean Smith over the last year or so and should feature against Wolves.\n\nRamsey, who made his Villa debut last season at West Brom, has been joining in in first-team training and has not looked out of place.\n\nThe 18-year-old was given a 10-minute cameo appearance in the last round against Brighton and may be used again off the bench. He has scored four goals and laid on three assists at youth level for Villa this season.\n\nJacob Ramsey has been impressing at youth level and could get a chance against Wolves\n\nKeinan Davis - Aston Villa\n\nKeinan Davis was tipped for a bright future, but for one reason or another, the striker has never really got his career off the ground.\n\nHe remains highly-rated at Villa and has been used regularly off the bench in the Premier League this season, but will hope to get a rare 90 minutes on Wednesday night.\n\nThe 21-year-old's only goal came in the 6-1 thrashing of Crewe in the second round of the Carabao Cup and he will be eager to remind boss Smith of his qualities in front of goal against rivals Wolves.\n\nKeinan Davis has mainly been used off the bench, and will hope for a rare 90 minutes\n\nChem Campbell - Wolves\n\nWolves are set to make major changes and unleash their youngsters for Wednesday night's clash at Villa Park.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries could be Chem Campbell, who is poised to become one of the youngest players to appear for the club in the modern era if he is given a taste of the action.\n\nThe 16-year-old midfielder has scored two times in the U18's Premier League this season and travelled with the first team to Bratislava last week for the Europa League win over Slovan. He looks set to be named on the bench for the Carabao Cup game.\n\nChem Campbell (R) travelled to Bratislava with Wolves last week and is line to feature at Villa\n\nBenny Ashley-Seal - Wolves\n\nAshley-Seal has been prolific at youth level and will be eager to show Nuno Espirito Santo he can make the step up.\n\nThe former Arsenal and Tottenham trainee is in Santo's thinking, having been named on the bench for their Premier League game with Newcastle earlier this season, but he is yet to feature for the first team.\n\nWith Santo ready to make wholesale changes, Ashley-Seal may finally be given his shot.\n\nWolves forward Benny Ashley-Seal is yet to be given any first-team action this season\n\nCHELSEA VS MANCHESTER UNITED\n\nMarc Guehi - Chelsea\n\nMarc Guehi picked up tricks of the trade from John Terry while he was moving through Chelsea's academy and is now emerging as a fine fine young centre half.\n\nThe 19-year-old has been named in several first-team squads this season and played the full 90 in their emphatic Carabao Cup win over Grimsby last month.\n\nGuehi will most likely feature against Manchester United on Wednesday, and will be aware that if he impresses, Frank Lampard will not hesitate to move him closer to the first team.\n\nFrank Lampard is a huge admirer of Marc Guehi and may play youngster against Man United\n\nTino Anjorin - Chelsea\n\nThe 17-year-old has made a blistering start to the season for Chelsea's youth teams, scoring six times in 11 games.\n\nHis performances have caught the attention of Lampard and Jody Morris, and both are confident he is ready to make the leap to the first-team after giving him a 23-minute cameo in the last round against Grimsby.\n\nAnjorin, who plays as an attacking midfielder, is viewed as one of the brightest prospects in Chelsea's burgeoning academy and could be given another chance in this competition on Wednesday night.\n\nMidfielder Tino Anjorin got a taste of first-team experience against Grimsby last month\n\nJames Garner - Manchester United\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer could be ready to place his trust in James Garner by starting him in the middle of the park against Chelsea.\n\nThe 18-year-old is one of the club's most promising talents and was given his first taste of senior football last year.\n\nSolskjaer clearly feels like now is the right time in his development to start exposing him to more first-team action as he handed him his Europa League debut earlier this month against Partizan, and has included him in United's 18-man travelling squad.\n\nJames Garner is in United's squad and is contention to start in midfield on Wednesday night\n\nBrandon Williams - Manchester United\n\nBrandon Williams has also been named in the squad travelling to Stamford Bridge.\n\nWilliams, who only made his debut in the last Carabao Cup round against Rochdale, won many plaudits from Solskjaer for his man-of-the-match performance in Belgrade earlier this month and will too be in contention for a starting berth.\n\nThe United boss is a huge admirer of the player and has predicted a bright future for the youngster.", "description": "Premier League clubs are set to use the Carabao Cup as an opportunity to blood their youngsters.
