The scores were 29-28, 28-29, 29-28.\n\nA relative newcomer to Bellator, Jackson signed a multi-fight deal with the promotion earlier this year. He made quite the impression on his new bosses when he rocked Ruth with a whipping head kick in the opening minutes of the fight. The shot sliced Ruth open above his left eye.\n\nThe second round was a back-and-forth affair with both men standing and trading in the pocket. Neither fighter showed fear or hesitation to extend past their comfort zone.\n\nThe third round magnified the buzz and excitement inside the Mohegan Sun Arena. An overhand right from Jackson knocked Ruth to the ground. After several hammerfists from Jackson, \u201cEZ\u201d Ruth somehow survived. Ruth was able to secure a series of takedowns towards the end of the fight to make it even more difficult to score.\n\nWith the victory, Ruth has won back-to-back fights since being eliminated from the Bellator welterweight grand prix. Meanwhile, Jackson had his three-fight win streak snapped.\n\nThe welterweight bout was part of the Bellator 231 main card. The main card aired on Paramount and streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 231 results include:\n\nEd Ruth def.
