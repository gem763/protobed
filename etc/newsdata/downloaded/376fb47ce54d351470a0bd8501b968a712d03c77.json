Although it\u2019s unclear when he hurt himself, he made his last carry at the end of the third quarter, wrapping up a nine-carry, eight-yard day.\n\nWilliams has not been as explosive this season as he was last season; his 1.55 yards per carry are more than a yard fewer than any running back with at least 22 carries. Still, it\u2019s a blow that will test the Chiefs\u2019 depth.\n\nHow will Chiefs adjust their offense without Williams?\n\nMaking matters worse for the Chiefs is that the player most likely to pick up Williams\u2019 slack is LeSean McCoy, who did not practice on Wednesday and was limited Thursday with an ankle malady.\n\nIf McCoy is unable to shoulder all of the Chiefs\u2019 rushing load, Darwin Thompson and Darrel Williams can pick up the slack. Thompson, in particular, could be intriguing as a sixth-round pick this April who declared after one impressive season at Utah State.\n\nThe Chiefs may also lean even more on reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes, as Sammy Watkins continues to blossom, and Demarcus Robinson appears to be a rising star. Stats can be misleading through just two weeks, but the Chiefs are only 17th in the league with 24 carries per game, which is surprising considering they\u2019ve led during most of their two contests.\n\nStory continues\n\nKansas City will need all the offense it can get when it hosts Baltimore. In their first full season with Lamar Jackson at the helm, the Ravens look dangerous and ready to try to out-score the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nChiefs running back Damien Williams was ruled out for Week 3 with a knee injury.
