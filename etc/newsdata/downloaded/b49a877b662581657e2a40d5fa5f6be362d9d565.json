(Reuters)\n\nBoris Johnson will reportedly tell the Queen she cannot sack him if MPs vote to oust him in a vote of no confidence.\n\nThe PM\u2019s senior aides are said to be drawing up legal advice for Her Majesty that is designed to keep Mr Johnson in place so he can take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, according to The Sun.\n\nThe paper claims Number 10 is using the Lascelles Principles, a set of 70-year-old rules that state the monarch must follow her Prime Minister\u2019s advice.\n\nQueen Elizabeth could be pulled deeper into the Brexit crisis. (PA) More\n\nA source said: \u201cBoris won\u2019t resign even if he loses a no-confidence vote, and it is not within the sovereign\u2019s constitutional powers to make him.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cThe PM will advise the Queen of that and she must follow her Prime Minister\u2019s advice. That\u2019s how this country works.\u201d\n\nThe move would risk bringing the Queen, who traditionally remains politically neutral, deeper into the Brexit crisis.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News UK:\n\nLeave.EU deletes and apologises for Angela Merkel \u2018Kraut\u2019 post\n\nBrexit: EU blames UK as talks stand on brink of collapse\n\nBoris Johnson insists he did not lie to the Queen over suspension of Parliament\n\nHowever, there is uncertainty over whether Mr Johnson could actually enact the Lascelles Principles, with some arguing that they are only designed to allow a monarch to refuse to call a general election.\n\nOthers suggest the passing of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act in 2011 meant the principles were essentially abandoned and that the Queen is still within her rights to sack a PM if they do not enjoy the confidence of the Commons.\n\nLabour peer and barrister Lord Falconer tweeted of the plan: \u201cOne of the conditions in the Lascelles Principles for refusing a dissolution was [that the] Monarch could rely on finding another Prime Minister who could carry on Government, for a reasonable period, with a working majority in the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nif in connection with a vote of no confidence an alternative PM, who commanded a cross party majority to deliver a specified programme was identified the Lascelles Principle would be satisfied. \u2014 Charlie Falconer (@LordCFalconer) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Lascelles stuff is utter nonsense - it can\u2019t be used to keep Johnson. But what it is - is a propaganda war by No 10 against the Palace - and a threat to the #Queen that they will spin against her, so she should fall into line. \u2014 Prof Kate Williams (@KateWilliamsme) October 8, 2019\n\nA) Lascelles was about protecting a functioning Parliament from dissolution, not the PM who is only PM because they have conf of MPs\n\nB) It was effectively abandoned in 2011 with FTPA anyway\n\nC) Queen has right to dismiss PM if they don\u2019t enjoy conf of Commons\n\n\n\nApart from that \ud83d\udc4c https://t.co/M5TZMJC92V \u2014 Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) October 8, 2019\n\nI'm afraid this is nonsense. The Lascelles Principles empowered the monarch to refuse to call an election, not the prime minister to refuse to be sacked. They are now in abeyance because of the Fixed Term Parliament Act. https://t.co/N1kJYwnfQG \u2014 (((\ud83d\udd77Frances Coppola))) (@Frances_Coppola) October 9, 2019\n\nHe added: \u201cIf there is no alternative PM who could command a majority after Boris Johnson loses a vote of no confidence then there will be nobody for who HMQ can send to form a government.\n\n\u201cBut if there is such an alternative, then Boris Johnson will have to vacate Downing Street.\u201d\n\nRoyal historian Kate Williams also dismissed the plans, tweeting that they were \u201cutter nonsense\u201d. She described the briefing as \u201ca propaganda war by No 10 against the Palace \u2013 and a threat to the Queen that they will spin against her, so she should fall into line\u201d.\n\nOpposition MPs have still yet to call a no-confidence vote against Mr Johnson, fearing they do not have the numbers \u2013 or a credible caretaker PM to take over.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said she could not support Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn becoming temporary Prime Minister.", "description": "The move would risk bringing the monarch deeper into the Brexit crisis.", "authors": ["Andy Wells", "Freelance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AtohLrSsc646dUZ2cJ44HA--~B/aD0yNjM3O3c9Mzk1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/f59f7b80-ae2a-11e9-bff4-0821697a97e7", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
