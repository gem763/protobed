One could even say it has 'devolved'. There seems to be a feeling of unease and gloom in the world. I call it a 'liquid fear'.\n\n\"Most people I speak to as I travel all over the world seem to ascribe it to the disruption caused by digitisation and by the actions of US President Donald Trump,\" Lindkvist told delegates at the SA Council of Shopping Centres (SACSC) annual conference in Cape Town.\n\nHe said a survey about the impact of artificial intelligence found that the two jobs least likely to be taken over by machines will be that of dentists and of priests.\n\nYet, for him the most important shift from the past is that there are now many more opportunities available.\n\n\"There is a dawning of a new age where people are moving away from a 'me' and 'my patents' attitude to what I call 'wedeas' \u2013 'we ideas', in other words ideas which people have reached in collaboration,\" he said.\n\n\"If you want to make money in retail, you would have to show some courage while everyone else is afraid of the future. Being a leader is doing the things others cannot or will not do because they are too afraid.\"", "description": "Research indicates that 82% of South Africans believe the country is going in the wrong direction, a 'trend spotter' tells delegates at a retail conference.", "authors": ["Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8069/703f047751624f60ab5338fa160bd482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
