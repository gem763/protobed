I personally don't have a problem with the thought of dying in a nursing home if my death is to be by wasting away. But, with my daughter being and RN and specialized in hospice nursing for several years, I would give her the choice of a larger inheritance by caring for me at home if that is what she would prefer (by my not spending down as much for LTC) I have known several people who have died at home who were definitely nursing home qualifiers.\n\nOn a more personal experience, by father was in assisted living for a few years in a highly rated retirement community which also included skilled nursing when the time came. One day my father goes into the hospital for a couple days and was then discharged to skilled nursing. I flew to the east coast to visit him and found my father was really not himself. I had just visited him a few months prior. It turned out that in the transition from assisted living, to hospital, to SN facility, there was not enough personal consistency of staff passing the baton to know if my father was \"normal\" (for him) or not. So, I had to make a fuss about it and make sure his long term primary care physician was brought in who new my father well. He was able to see action needed to be taken to get him back to normal. IIRC things got screwed up with his medications causing him to be really out of it. My point is that while hospitals and skilled nursing do have more means to care for patients than one might at home, they might not know their newcomers well enough to discern their baseline health. My father came in on a wheelchair, remaining in a semi conscious state and they just figured that was his normal, like half the other people there.", "description": "To dye at home or not to dye at home... that is the question. - 20894", "authors": ["Explorer", "Participant"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
