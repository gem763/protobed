While the law provides a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that life should be maintained, judges are asked to decide what is in the best interest of the child\n\nAndrea Williams, the campaign group\u2019s founder, said: \u2018What it shows is that when parents believe their child should continue to be given a chance of life, their views are usually disregarded. But at the end of the day, children belong to the parents, not to the state.\u2019\n\nBut doctors argue that the rulings are based on clear evidence that keeping a child alive with no hope of recovery often only prolongs their pain and distress.\n\nWhile the law provides a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that life should be maintained, judges are asked to decide what is in the best interest of the child.\n\nOfficial judgments have been published in 12 of the 22 cases, of which this newspaper was able to review ten. Apart from the case of Tafida, a five-year-old girl who has been on life support since suffering a brain injury in February, the courts substantially agreed with doctors that the youngster should be allowed to die\n\nEarlier this month, the High Court ruled that Tafida\u2019s parents could take her to Italy for treatment that might prolong her life.\n\nBoy A A boy aged two suffered severe brain injuries and was paralysed from the neck down after a car crash in 2015 that left him without a heartbeat for 17 minutes. The boy\u2019s father agreed to a request from doctors to withdraw life support, but the youngster\u2019s mother disagreed, saying he responded to her voice and curled his hands \u2018as a sign of pleasure\u2019. A judge approved withdrawal of ventilation for the boy in June 2016, but the mother appealed on the grounds there had been differing opinions about whether the youngster was in pain. The Appeal Court ruled against the mother on the basis that it was likely the boy could feel pain, but even if he didn\u2019t, his poor prognosis meant his life was not worth living.\n\nLawyers for parents Mohammed Raqeeb and Shelina Begum, who are Muslims, claimed the youngster could make a partial recovery and live for \u2018ten or 20 years\u2019, but doctors at The Royal London Hospital said there was no prospect of a meaningful recovery and it was kinder to let her die.\n\nMr Justice MacDonald ruled that because Tafida could not feel pain and was not suffering, it was right the decision \u2018be taken by a parent in the exercise of their parental responsibility\u2019.\n\nThough the decision may encourage more parents of desperately sick children to challenge doctors who want to withhold life-sustaining treatment such as ventilation and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), few have been successful in the past.\n\nCharlie Gard, who had a rare genetic disorder, died two years ago aged 11 months after Court of Appeal judges allowed doctors to stop providing life-support despite his parents raising \u00a31.3 million to send him to the USA for a trial treatment.\n\nLast April, the parents of 23-month-old Alfie Evans lost their legal battle to prevent Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital in Liverpool from withdrawing ventilation.", "description": "Data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and seen by The Mail on Sunday shows that the courts dealt with 22 cases concerning 'withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment'.", "authors": ["Stephen Adams Health Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/14764446-0-image-a-9_1571519965057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
