She has accused them of focusing on the process in the House in an effort to distract from the allegations against the president.\n\nRepublicans have complained that Democratic leaders \u2014 especially Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff \u2014 are conducting the investigation in the dark. Last week, A group of roughly 30 Republicans even attempted to enter the secure hearing room where witnesses in the probe were testifying.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was quick to deride the Democrats' latest move as \"backtracking.\"\n\nTrump is a vocal critic of the inquiry, which was spurred in large part by his request for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to \"look into\" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump had also asked Zelensky to \"do us a favor though\" and look into Ukraine's alleged role in foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nA whistleblower's complaint about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky has raised questions about hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. That aid had been withheld for months without a clear explanation, though it was eventually released in September.", "description": "House Democrats are poised to hold a vote to move forward with the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger Tucker Higgins", "Kevin Breuninger", "Tucker Higgins", "In"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106208024-1572290771885gettyimages-1181675282.jpeg?v=1572290796", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
