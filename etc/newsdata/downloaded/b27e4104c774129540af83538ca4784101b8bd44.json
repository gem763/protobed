Hopefully, that doesn\u2019t delay its regular season premiere.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans announced Thursday that Williamson has been ruled out with right knee soreness for the team\u2019s final preseason game against the New York Knicks on Friday. The No. 1 overall pick will also be undergoing further evaluation while the team is away.\n\nThe team\u2019s statement:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson is listed as out with right knee soreness for the team\u2019s final preseason game against the Knicks. He did not travel with the team to New York today and remained in New Orleans to undergo further testing and evaluation at Ochsner Sports Medicine.\n\nFurther updates will be forthcoming when available.\n\nESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski later reported that the Pelicans are being cautious with Williamson\u2019s injury, and that this isn\u2019t a typical preseason rest situation.\n\nA knee issue popping up is particularly concerning for Williamson because he also missed all but one Summer League due to a bruised left knee. Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin said at the time that the decision was made with \u201can abundance of caution.\u201d This new knee soreness is in the other knee, but multiple issues popping up for the 284-pound Williamson is troublesome nonetheless.\n\nZion Williamson\u2019s incredible preseason comes to an end\n\nBefore the knee soreness news, it had been full speed ahead for the Zion Williamson hype train this preseason.\n\nStory continues\n\nWilliamson averaged 23.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game while shooting an absurd 71.4 percent from the field. One analysis from The Ringer found that scoring average to be the best preseason mark for a rookie since David Robertson, who was 24 at the time, averaged 24.9 points in 1989. Even when adjusting for Williamson\u2019s paint-heavy shot chart with true shooting percent \u2014 which properly values 3-point and free throw shooting \u2014 he looks like an unprecedented talent.\n\nNow, you might ask if Williamson has been doing this against legit NBA talent or some preseason scrubs. I will subsequently direct you to the date of Oct. 11, in which Williamson posted 26 points on 9-of-12 shooting with two-time reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert patrolling the paint.\n\nEven against the most dominant paint defender in the game today, Williamson could not be stopped.\n\nZion lays it in over Gobert \ud83d\udcaa pic.twitter.com/gW684KbtKh \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) October 12, 2019\n\nSo much of Zion's success last night against the Jazz came while playing center, which I've long argued is his most advantageous position. Mismatch nightmare even against the league's best defensive anchors. Hope to see a lot of Center Zion this season. https://t.co/7bjv83CHJ2 pic.twitter.com/i6e6Mi9bKp \u2014 Mike Schmitz (@Mike_Schmitz) October 12, 2019\n\nThe Pelicans are five days away from their season opener against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, which will be broadcast on TNT. Hopefully, Williamson will be ready to go by then.\n\nZion Williamson had looked like a force of nature in his first preseason campaign with the Pelicans.
