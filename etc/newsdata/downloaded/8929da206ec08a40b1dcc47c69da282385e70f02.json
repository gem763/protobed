Cornstein, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a blowout gala for 800 guests. He flew in singer Paul Anka from California. The guest of honor was Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has curtailed the very freedoms the event was meant to highlight.\n\nStanding at a lectern, Cornstein declared Orban \u201cthe perfect partner\u201d and \u201ca very, very strong and good leader.\u201d Anka serenaded the Hungarian leader with a personalized rendition of \u201cMy Way.\u201d\n\nFor many in the room, it was a bewildering spectacle: an American ambassador lavishing praise on a far-right leader whose party has methodically eroded Hungarian democracy and pushed anti-Semitic tropes. But it was just another demonstration of Cornstein\u2019s pattern of emboldening Orban.\n\nSince becoming ambassador in June 2018, Cornstein has assiduously courted Orban, giving the Hungarian leader unexpected influence in the Trump administration. Cornstein used his decadeslong friendship with President Donald Trump to help broker a coveted Oval Office meeting for Orban in May \u2014 a meeting now under scrutiny by impeachment investigators in Washington.\n\nAt the time, some White House officials tried to stop the meeting, citing Orban\u2019s anti-democratic record in Hungary and his growing closeness to Russia. The meeting went ahead, and Orban is said to have used it to fuel the president\u2019s suspicions about Ukraine.\n\nAs yet, Cornstein\u2019s role in that meeting does not appear to be part of the impeachment inquiry. But his freewheeling diplomacy and courtship of Orban have alarmed career civil servants and contributed to broader criticism, even among Republicans, that some members of the president\u2019s foreign policy team are dangerously unprepared for the job.\n\nDuring the past year, Cornstein, an 81-year-old jewelry magnate, has developed unusually close relationships with Orban and his advisers, according to several American and Western officials. He exchanges text messages with them, occasionally from personal devices, and boasts about his contacts \u2014 even as American security officials warn that Orban is trying to manipulate him.\n\nHe has undermined efforts by career diplomats to deliver messages to Washington about corruption and democratic backsliding in Hungary. And he has privately acted as a broker for Orban\u2019s point of view, taking positions contrary to U.S. policy, according to interviews with roughly two dozen current and former American and foreign officials as well as others who have worked with Cornstein.\n\nHe has also adopted some of Orban\u2019s talking points on Ukraine, contradicting the policy of the United States and its NATO allies.\n\nSome embassy officials were so taken aback that, according to two American officials, they confided to a recent congressional delegation that Washington\u2019s top man in Hungary acted more like Orban\u2019s top man in the Trump administration.\n\nIn two interviews, Cornstein played down concerns about Hungarian corruption, anti-Semitism and the erosion of democracy. He defended his approach as good for the United States and said that his outreach to Orban was exactly what Trump wanted.\n\n\u201cHopefully there are one or two people who think I\u2019m doing a good job,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump seems pleased. Although the Obama administration sought to isolate Orban as punishment for his authoritarian tendencies, the Trump administration has engaged him uncritically, a strategy intended to keep the Hungarian leader from drifting toward China and Russia.\n\nBut Thomas Carothers, who studies democracies for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Cornstein\u2019s public praise for Orban had gone too far. \u201cThe ambassador has crossed the line, both in openly endorsing bad things and mocking serious issues,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivately, Cornstein has gone even further.\n\nIn April, a group of congressional staff members visited Budapest on a trip sponsored by the Hungarian government. Realizing that Hungarian officials would present a rosy picture, American diplomats squeezed in a 45-minute briefing about corruption and the erosion of democracy.", "description": "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The annual Independence Day celebration at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest is usually a modest garden party, a chance for the ambassador to celebrate American freedom, democracy and the rule of law.This year, the ambassador, David B.
