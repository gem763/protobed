If so, please let me know. Please share and ask your friends to share,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThese scumbags think urinating in a lift is socially acceptable. This happened at the RSL Centre in Surfers Paradise on Friday night just gone.\n\n\u201cThe police would like to have a chat to them. Personally, I\u2019d like to rub their faces in it.\u201d\n\nSocial media users were disgusted by the video, calling for the couple to be named.\n\n\u201cHope the police get to meet them. Horrendous,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cHopefully someone will identify these disrespectful grubs,\u201d another said.\n\nMs Elliot later responded saying that someone had messaged her and passed on the details of the woman, which she then gave to the police.\n\nA Queensland Police spokesperson confirmed to news.com.au that the police were investigating the incident.", "description": "A couple have been blasted on social media after footage emerged of them using the elevator as a toilet at a Gold Coast RSL.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/31ef91da424bb61eeb42f43b54e3c87b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
