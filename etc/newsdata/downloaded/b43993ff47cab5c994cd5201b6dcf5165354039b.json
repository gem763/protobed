Valverde said: 'it's hard to get words out of Dembele in Spanish so it can't have been a long phrase!'\"\n\nThe win is Barcelona's fourth in a row and sees them climb to second in the table, just two points behind rivals Real Madrid .\n\nInitially there had been pressure on Valverde after a poor start to the season, which saw them drop points to the likes of Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSince then they have improved, however, and look like they will challenge Madrid as they look to win their third La Liga title in a row.\n\nAfter the international break they travel to Eibar on October 19 before two crucial games against Slavia Prague in the Champions League and then a huge El Clasico derby against Real Madrid at the Nou Camp.", "description": "The Catalan club cruised to a 4-0 victory in spite of playing with nine men for the last few minutes", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527745.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_La-Liga-Santander-FC-Barcelona-v-Sevilla.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
