He reckoned Geri would turn the other girls -Mel B, Mel C, Emma Bunton and Victoria Adams (now Beckham) - against the management.\n\nLater in the note, Bob writes: \"We included Geri because she had a very strong personality and her looks seemed to suit the image we were trying to project.\"\n\nIt went on to scold her musical abilties.\n\nBob continued: \"Unfortunately she was tone deaf and had awful timing, which meant she was unable to sing in tune or dance in time.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nStill, Geri stayed in the band and earned the adoration of fans for her bubbly, personable style and cheeky daring.\n\nShe even pinched Prince Charles on the bum, and told former South African president Nelson Mandela: \"You're as young as the girl you feel, and I'm 25.\"\n\nNot at the original auditions in 1994, Geri kept calling up until she got through to Chris Herbert, Bob's son, who was instantly charmed by her.\n\nHe recalled: \"It didn't dawn on me at the time but I think she obviously knew she would have failed an early round audition and she wanted to bypass that.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nGeri herself would later admit as much, saying: \"I didn't think I would have got an audition. My vocal technique was not very good.\"\n\nShe quickly became a leader figure in the band after the five were put together - at 21, she was the oldest and had a personality to be reckoned with.\n\nMel B even described her new band mate as a \"mad, eccentric nutter from another planet.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBob's note goes on: \"For weeks her lack of talent was a severe problem for her but with perseverance we found slots for her in the harmonies and the dance routines.\n\n\"Her strength of character started to dominate the other girls in the group but, at first, this was fairly good as it helped her to organise them into a daily routine.\"\n\nWhen the positivity started to flood in in response the girls, Bob reckons it did something to Geri's mindset.\n\n\"The response we had from the writers and producers went to Geri's head,\" he wrote, \"From that point onwards she became more and more uncontrollable and wanted to take over the running of the group.\"\n\nAs this happened, Bob became more and more convinced that Geri needed to be replaced with a new fifth member. He also thought that Geri had clocked his plans and was ready to fight back.\n\nBob added: \"She did this by running the management down to everybody she came came into contact with and naturally gained their support because they could see a rift develop.\"", "description": "A memo unearthed from before the girls rocketed to superstardom shows the group's management thought Geri was 'tone deaf'", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Getty Images", "Press Association", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740480.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Ginger-Spice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
