Either way, Bake Off fans are loving Michael and Henry (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe Great British Bake Off reaches its agonisingly close finale tonight after the most loved up series yet comes to an end. And fans think there\u2019s been a welcomed romance blossoming behind-the-scenes between Henry Bird and Michael Chakraverty.\n\nHenry has been the most talked about contestant by far this cycle, namely for his questionable shirt and tie get-up, and because he was romantically linked to fellow baker Alice Feveronia.\n\nThey remained silent over the rumours, but now a photo of Henry and Michael cosying up over some brownies \u2013 which already sounds like heaven on Earth \u2013 has got fans shipping hard.\n\nAlice shared the picture on her Instagram stories and it wasn\u2019t long before the nation began cooing in their droves:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlice \u2013 who will be competing against Steph Blackwell and David Atherton for the Bake Off title tonight \u2013also posted another shot of Henry planting one on Michael\u2019s cheek, with the caption: \u2018But how many couples can you see\u2026?\u2019 last month.\n\nNeither Michael nor Henry have suggested they\u2019re anything other than good pals, but bromance or romance, we\u2019re here for it.\n\nMichael and Henry were both booted out of the Bake Off tent earlier this series, but the latter\u2019s legacy lived on with a touching tribute from his rivals in the semi-finals last week.\n\nHowever, they\u2019ll both be appearing in tonight\u2019s finale with Michael revealing he\u2019ll be wearing some pink dungarees, which will inevitably steal the eventual winners\u2019 thunder for sure.\n\nGreat British Bake Off concludes tonight at 8pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
