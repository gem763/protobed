'At such a young age I didn't understand what was happening and the way I was feeling.\n\n'When I had my first panic attack I thought it was a heart attack, as it was something I had never experienced. Not long after that most days became extremely difficult.\n\n'Around this time I was supposed to be having my GCSE exams in school, but my anxiety was so debilitating I had to sit my GCSE's at home.'\n\n'When I tried to leave the house I would completely shake with fear and was finding myself beginning to have the same panic attacks I dreaded every time I thought of going in to a shop or being in public.\n\n'The now confident entrepreneur reveals that normal activities I would be able to do became something that was too difficult. Around this time I was suppose to be having my GCSE exams in school, but my anxiety was so debilitating I had to sit my GCSE's at home\n\nTeri admits that Sheba (pictured) was a puppy when she got her at 17, and was still suffering from mental health. She said that Sheba helped her gain the confidence she needed and helped her leave the house\n\n'During this time I had developed an eating disorder from the fear of choking on food. While my everyday fear with struggling from mental health was not being able to breathe - which when you're having a panic attack feels like your unable to breathe.\n\n'It made me feel completely alone. I was only 16, not many 16 year-olds could understand what their friend was going through, I couldn't understand it and I was the one going through it. I spent the summer alone in my house.\n\n'Mental health can make it extremely difficult sometimes to have relationships and friendship. You don't want to go out and do the things you would normally have wanted to do.\n\nShe admits that when she first starting suffering from anxieties at 16 she spent the summer alone - as her friends were too young to understand what she was going through\n\nTeri said she wanted to create something different than just the average watch - she wanted the watch and the brand to have meaning. Pictured: Her Amare collection\n\n'I feel there is more support today than there was only seven years ago, which I am grateful for. I often think about the fact that there will be plenty of young people out there that will hopefully have the support that can help them.\n\nTalking about starting her business she said: 'When I first decided to go self employed, I knew it wouldn't be easy. I had very little, to - no experience running a business and I hadn't taken a business course. I simply turned my business in to a passion and just believed in my self.\n\n'I started contacting factories on my laptop and began doing the research in to watches. I wanted to create something different than just the average watch on the shelf you see. I wanted the watch and the brand to have meaning. I love photography, so I have a lot of fun creating photos and content.\n\nShe reveals she had no experience running a business but simply turned her business into a passion and just believed in herself\n\nTeri Ellington, 23, overcome severe anxiety and agoraphobia to build up her business - facing many obstacles on her journey\n\nMy main reason for creating the brand was to help me and my mental health, I wanted to be self employed and have something that gave me purpose. I named the first collection after my German Shepherd Sheba.\n\n'Sheba was a puppy I got when I was 17, this was when I was still suffering from mental health. Sheba helped me gain the confidence I needed and helped me leave the house. I wanted to name the first collection after her - the Sheba Collection.\n\n'This was a limited run of only 300 - as this was all I could only afford at the time and this gave me the idea of the limited editions run. The Sheba collection came in three leather strap colours - Grey, Black and Tan.\n\nTeri creates men and women's watches through her limited edition and is currently selling her Amare Collection - which means love in Latin\n\n'I came up with the idea of a authenticity numbered certificate to make it that extra special. When I told my story about the Sheba collection I started to receive countless messages from people, telling me they too have suffered from mental health or that they or a loved one was going through it, and it made me realise just how important it is to speak up about it. It made me realise that my story and experience may have helped someone from just speaking out.\n\nHowever, it wasn't all plain sailing along the way. When she promoted her first collection in House of Fraser she had some rude encounters. She posted on her Instagram account recently: 'It's crazy to think that this month last year I was stood in the house of Fraser with a pop up stand and my very first collection, the Sheba collection.\n\n'The fear of not knowing whether or not I would sell was only one of my many fears. I had to walk up to complete strangers and ask if they would like to see something I created, something that was personal to me.\n\nWhen she promoted her first collection in House of Fraser she had some rude encounters and posted about it on Instagram recently\n\nSome people were kind and some people were rude, and I learnt over the hours not to take it to heart. When people would come over my hands would shake just getting my watches out and letting people try them on.\n\nI told people who wanted to listen to my story and the meaning behind the brand. When I told them about my anxiety and my story of agoraphobia, I saw a lot of people look at me and could relate, I saw the look in people's eyes that told me they too went something similar. In an environment I wasn't familiar with I somehow felt calm and felt I wasn't alone.\n\n'A few weeks before this I struggled to make ends meet, struggling and crying wondering if my business would succeed. Within one weekend I sold out my entire stock I had on me! The Saturday night came and I cried with relief!\n\n'But, Sunday came and I put my pop stand up and started the process again. I walked over to a guy and said the same usual line \" hi sir, would you like to take a look at my watches\".. He simply looked at me and started saying \" why are you so special, what's so special about your watches, why would I buy a watch off you\".\n\nTeri also reveals that she has big ambition for the line in the future: 'I would like to create limited edition handbags and shoes in the future for both men and women'\n\n'Shocked at the response I said \" sorry I bothered you\" and walked away to which he shouted across the store \" well if you can't sell me your product!\" ! I was humiliated! A young woman came over and asked if I was ok and I burst into tears'.\n\n'The man walked past and the young women told him he should of been ashamed of himself! Why am I telling you this? Because no matter how good you are doing and how far you have come, there is always going to be somebody who will try to bring you down, whether it be jealousy or just they are a bitter person, they will try!\n\n'It's up to you whether or not you let them bother you. I wiped away my tears and sold more watches that day. The sales helped me get my 2019 collection.'\n\nWhile she admitted to FEMAIL that she had to make a few sacrifices along the way: 'A few of mine was selling my beloved car and sleeping on a sofa for almost six months. It's still just me, on my own, but I am planning to expand and employ a team around me. I'm very lucky to have had the support I have needed to get to where I am.'\n\nThe young entrepreneur admitted to FEMAIL that she had to make a few sacrifices along the way including selling her car and sleeping on a sofa\n\nTeri's latest line of watches is the Amare Collection - which is a limited run of only 600. 'When I designed this collection I wanted it to be a completely different design to the Sheba collection as each collection has a different meaning, design and authenticity numbered certificate.\n\n'The Amare collection means to Love in Latin, this can mean to love another or yourself. Each watch from the Amare collection comes with a red and gold box and wax sealed authenticity numbered certificate and is professionally made - designed with a Japanese quartz movement, stainless steel strap, mineral glass and are 5ATM water resistant,' Teri revealed.\n\nThe watches, which are sold exclusively via her website, are priced between \u00a3120 and \u00a3145 and have a unique design with a layered dial which has a ripple effect in the middle.\n\nHer hopes for the business are that it makes a change to peoples lives and that she can continue to create watches with purpose: 'Through social media we use positive notes that have quotes about self love, positivity and mental health quotes to help raise awareness.'\n\nHer hopes for the business are that it makes a change to peoples lives and that she can continue to create watches with purpose\n\n'Within my brand I have created a movement called #yourstoryetp. People who purchase my watches are telling their own story about mental health.\n\n'I believe my brand has created a community for not only watch lovers, but also help and support for one another. We also currently use biodegradable bubble wrap to help reduce the waste that is polluting the oceans.\n\nTeri also reveals that she has big ambition for the line in the future: 'I would like to create limited edition handbags and shoes in the future for both men and women.'\n\n'I'm currently in the process of creating an every day line that will represent life for people everyday - and this will help continue to raise awareness for mental health. As someone who found it difficult to do things day to day I want these watches to be a reminder of your strength in day to day life.
