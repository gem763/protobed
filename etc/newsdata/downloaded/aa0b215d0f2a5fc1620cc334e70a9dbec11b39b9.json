She had cleared everyone else out of the room, telling them: \u2018I need to be alone with this boy.\u2019\n\nReminding himself that he was a married man with three young children waiting for him at home, the young Canadian photographer played for time. He pretended not to hear her, fiddling nervously with his cameras.\n\nMonroe went back into her dressing room and emerged wearing just a white dressing gown which she immediately took off, slipping into bed and under its single silk sheet. \u2018I stole little glances of her backside and breasts as she moved,\u2019 said Kirkland\n\nThe heady sexual tension that night in a photographer\u2019s studio in Los Angeles produced some of the most famous pictures ever taken of Monroe. The actress never looked so seductive, a fact that gave her no small pleasure.\n\n\u2018I like this girl because she\u2019s the kind of woman every man would like to be in there with,\u2019 she told Kirkland, as they looked through the photos later.\n\n\u2018The kind of girl a truck driver would like to be in that bed with.\u2019\n\nMonroe, whose lovers reportedly included President John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby, set her sights rather higher than truck drivers.\n\nAt the time of the photoshoot, despite being at the peak of her fame, she was hiding from the public gaze.\n\nKirkland, who went on to photograph many of the world\u2019s most beautiful women, was only 27 when he was sent to snap Monroe for the now defunct Look magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary issue. He is pictured hanging off the balcony\n\nHer marriage to playwright Arthur Miller was disintegrating and she was rumoured to be seeing her thuggish baseball star ex-husband Joe DiMaggio.\n\nTragically, her unhappy private life wouldn\u2019t burden her much longer. Just nine months after the photoshoot in November 1961, the actress died from a barbiturates overdose.\n\nIn New York later this month, Christie\u2019s is auctioning the camera, a 1959 Hasselblad, and lenses that captured the photos, along with two prints from the shoot.\n\nThe lot is expected to fetch \u00a3160,000 to \u00a3240,000 \u2014 a sum that reflects the lingering fame of the pictures.\n\nFifty-eight years on, Kirkland, now 85, told me this week there was nothing unusual about the chemistry between him and Marilyn.\n\n\u2018A successful photo session is a seductive dance between the photographer and his subject. This is how interesting photographs happen,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018There has to be some sort of attraction and tension, whether you are photographing a man or a woman.\u2019\n\nHowever, he wasn\u2019t nearly so blase about it at the time.\n\nKirkland, who went on to photograph many of the world\u2019s most beautiful women, was only 27 when he was sent to snap Monroe for the now defunct Look magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary issue.\n\nIt was his first major assignment and he was terrified.\n\nHis worst fear was that the star of Some Like It Hot and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes would sense his inexperience and demand another photographer.\n\nA few days before the shoot, he and two magazine colleagues met Monroe and her press agent at her modest basement flat in Beverly Hills.\n\nKirkland knew what he wanted \u2014 a photo of her naked in bed \u2014 but felt embarrassed to ask her, especially as she had insisted he sat next to her on her bed.\n\nFortunately, Monroe, with her \u2018sweet intuitiveness\u2019, quickly articulated what he wanted, adding only: \u2018But the sheets must be silk.\u2019\n\nAlone with the world\u2019s most desired woman writhing voluptuously around naked in bed, Doug Kirkland was understandably lost for words when Marilyn Monroe invited him to join her\n\nShe also wanted the photoshoot to be well-supplied with Dom Perignon champagne, her favourite tipple, and Frank Sinatra records.\n\nBefore they left, Monroe\u2019s press agent quietly told him the actress had recently lost weight, which had pleased her. However, she was \u2018fixated\u2019 on her breasts, which she thought were now too small.\n\nOn the evening of the shoot, Monroe was two hours late at the rented studio on Santa Monica Boulevard, her agent failing to calm Kirkland\u2019s fraying nerves by reassuring him she always turned up eventually.\n\nFinally, she arrived at 9.30pm, a \u2018burst of ethereal beauty\u2019, he said, that bowled him over with her \u2018dazzling, misty whiteness\u2019. He was smitten within seconds.\n\nKirkland quickly poured the champagne and put on Sinatra as she sashayed into a dressing room with her hair and make-up assistants.\n\nAlso present were a magazine writer, Kirkland\u2019s assistant and a studio man who was to lock up when they were finished.\n\nThe shoot didn\u2019t start auspiciously. It was clear Monroe was not taken with Kirkland\u2019s elaborate idea to photograph her wearing an ankle-length, spangly dress and wrapped herself in a long piece of white cloth.\n\nMarilyn Monroe is pictured above with Marlon Brando. Monroe, whose lovers reportedly included President John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby, set her sights rather higher than truck drivers\n\nSuddenly, she stopped, complaining the fabric was \u2018cheap cheesecloth\u2019 when it should be silk. \u2018I\u2019m not a cheesecloth kind of girl!,\u2019 she said peevishly.\n\n\u2018I was learning another important lesson of my profession,\u2019 said Kirkland. \u2018You must treat a star like the princess you want her to be in front of your lens if you are to elicit her most outstanding performance.\u2019\n\nHe was convinced the actress was going to walk out, demanding he be replaced, but she didn\u2019t.\n\nWith hindsight, he said, \u2018she was a very sweet and kind girl\u2019 who \u2014 as the product of a broken home and childhood poverty \u2014 knew what it was like to have to deal with adversity.\n\nAdversity like the nightmare Kirkland was facing now.\n\nMonroe went back into her dressing room and emerged wearing just a white dressing gown which she immediately took off, slipping into bed and under its single silk sheet.\n\n\u2018I stole little glances of her backside and breasts as she moved,\u2019 said Kirkland. \u2018She may have intended for me to catch those little glimpses.\u2019\n\nHe admits it was all \u2018very exciting for me in my young man way\u2019.\n\nMonroe \u2018was within arm\u2019s reach, twisting and turning under the sheet, which was semi-transparent\u2019.\n\nWhat he called their \u2018flirtatious dance\u2019 continued as he started taking close-up shots and \u2018felt deep desire rising from within myself\u2019.\n\nHe found himself \u2018whispering promises laden with innuendo\u2019 without understanding where his feelings were coming from.\n\nThey were by now both sipping their glasses of champagne although Kirkland assures me Marilyn \u2014 who had serious drink and drugs addictions \u2014 barely drank anything.\n\nIt was at this point the evening became even more intimate as she suddenly sat up in bed, covered her breasts and announced: \u2018I know what we need \u2014 I need to be alone with this boy. I find it usually works better that way.\u2019\n\nThe others filed out.\n\nConfused as to what she expected him to do, he \u2018retreated\u2019 behind his camera and started shooting again.\n\n\u2018It got very sexually charged,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s where the pictures came from.\u2019\n\nWith the room lit by floodlight to avoid the mood being spoilt by a flash, Kirkland went up to a small balcony so he could shoot directly over the bed.\n\nHe was by now \u2018very stimulated\u2019 and \u2018made no secret of it\u2019 while Monroe \u2018showed me how she felt, slithering erotically between the sheets\u2019.\n\nThen, she looked up and, said Kirkland, \u2018pleaded\u2019 for him to \u2018come down here with me\u2019.\n\nIn a book he wrote in 2004, he spelt it out: \u2018I was being invited to get into bed with her.\u2019\n\nThis week, as he reiterated that nothing ever came of it, Kirkland \u2014 possibly in more cynical mood now he\u2019s in his 80s \u2014 claimed \u2018the night was just an exciting tease\u2019.\n\nMonroe, he added, \u2018was just being Marilyn and playing to the camera as she knew how to do very well\u2019. Friends have expressed disbelief when he told them of her carnal offer and he admits \u2018part of me was certainly ready\u2019.\n\nInstead, he reminded himself of his young family. A few years earlier, both virgins, he had married his high-school sweetheart in the Canadian town near Niagara Falls where he\u2019d grown up.\n\n\u2018I was an innocent (very innocent), sexually supercharged guy in my mid-20,\u2019 he recalled.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t respond because I was busy loading my film and continuing to take pictures.\u2019\n\nKirkland believes the pictures he got wouldn\u2019t have been so good if he\u2019d got into bed with his subject. \u2018We were both on such a fine, teetering edge,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Ultimately all of that fused energy was channelled directly into the lens.\u2019\n\nAs the shoot started to wind down, he felt a \u2018warm satisfying sense of relief, almost as if we\u2019d had sex\u2019.\n\nHe ended up lying on the floor next to her bed and they chatted about their lives and beliefs.\n\nMonroe, he added, \u2018was just being Marilyn and playing to the camera as she knew how to do very well\u2019. Friends have expressed disbelief when he told them of her carnal offer and he admits \u2018part of me was certainly ready\u2019\n\n\u2018She told me about her difficult beginnings and I told her about coming from a small town in Canada and never dreaming I would some day be photographing the goddess she had become.\u2019\n\nTwenty minutes later, he got up and let the others back in. They didn\u2019t finally leave until well past midnight. Kirkland said he had trouble sleeping that night at the Chateau Marmont hotel as he thought about what might have been.\n\n\u2018We had nearly been lovers an hour earlier and now she was gone,\u2019 he said. \u2018The Marilyn Monroe I had been with on that night of the shoot unquestionably took a firm hold on me.\n\n\u2018She arrived in a misty vision, and when she left it was as if she had evaporated. I admitted to myself with some embarrassment that I missed her already.\u2019\n\nHowever, the spell was well and truly broken the following evening as he pitched up at Monroe\u2019s home with a spring in his step to show her the pictures he\u2019d taken.\n\nShe answered the door wearing sunglasses and a scarf over her head. She sounded \u2018drawn, tired and disturbed\u2019 and didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d slept at all.\n\nKirkland said he reviewed the photos with a \u2018darker, sadder\u2019 woman than the \u2018breathy, sexy beauty\u2019 he had photographed.\n\nHe\u2019d been pleased with them but she bluntly told him they \u2018aren\u2019t great\u2019 and cut up half of them with scissors.\n\nHowever, her mood improved and she finally found one she liked \u2014 of her clutching a pillow the way she\u2019d clutch a lover.\n\nThis was the girl who men would want to sleep with, she told him, using the third person to describe herself.\n\nThey left on a positive note, with Marilyn telling him: \u2018I want to do this with you again, real soon!\u2019\n\nNine months later, he was in Paris when he saw the headlines that she was dead.\n\n\u2018I was in disbelief and heartbroken like the rest of the world,\u2019 he said. The pictures are some of the last professional photos that were taken of Monroe.\n\nKirkland\u2019s success with her proved the making of his career, especially with beautiful actresses. He photographed Julie Christie, Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn.\n\nBut, he says, he still \u2018gets a buzz\u2019 of remembering his moment with Marilyn, a woman who could wield her sex appeal with ruthless efficiency.", "description": "TOM LEONARD: The heady sexual tension that night in a photographer's studio in Los Angeles produced some of the most famous pictures ever taken of Monroe.", "authors": ["Tom Leonard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19903136-0-image-a-10_1571431560772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
