Here\u2019s how much it costs", "language": "en", "text": "The late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u2019s 400-foot mega-yacht is up for sale.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe price: A cool $325.5 million.\n\nDubbed the \u201cOctopus,\u201d it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s largest boats, and costs a whopping four times more than what Allen paid for his NBA franchise, the Portland Trailblazers.\n\nSo what do you get for a third of a billion dollars? Two elevators. Two helipads. A pool.\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll get a private deck (which comes with a bar), a hot tub (in case you get tire of the pool) and an al fresco dining area for hosting dinner parties on the sea. But that\u2019s not all.\n\nOther amenities include a movie theater, a basketball court, a library and a spa. That\u2019s along with an observation deck, a hyperbaric chamber and an eight-person underwater submarine that docks in the ship (or a remote explorer if you prefer to stay onboard).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the sleeping quarters, there are 13 guest cabins and 30 rooms for the crew.\n\nThe Octopus comes with history, too. It traveled the Antarctic coast and the Northwest Passage. It\u2019s also hosted parties with famous actors and musicians. In 2011, the Rolling Stones\u2019 Mick Jagger used the boat as an impromptu recording studio.\n\nYacht-management firm Burgess is the seller, if you\u2019re interested. Just keep in mind that maintaining and operating a ship costs an estimated 10 percent of the purchase price.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAllen launched the boat in 2003 and died in 2018 from complications of cancer.", "description": "The \u201cOctopus\u201d is one of the world\u2019s largest boats, and costs a whopping four times more than what Allen paid for the Portland Trailblazers.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
