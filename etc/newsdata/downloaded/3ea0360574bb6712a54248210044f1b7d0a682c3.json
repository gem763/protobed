On Tuesday, voters of North Carolina\u2019s ninth district will head back to the polls to elect a representative after months of unraveling electoral chicanery.\n\nThe district, which extends southeast from the Charlotte suburbs along the state\u2019s border with South Carolina, held an election last November, just like everyone else. It was a close one: Republican Mark Harris, a far-right candidate who defeated Republican incumbent Robert Pittenger in a primary challenge in the spring, defeated Democrat Dan McCready, a then 35-year-old U.S. Marines veteran, by 905 votes out of more than 282,000 cast.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, though, state officials uncovered a number of peculiar patterns among mail-in ballots: In all but one of the district\u2019s counties, McCready won handily among these absentee voters, by 16 points. But in Bladen County, he lost by a whopping 24 points. Journalists discovered that the same names appeared on many of these absentee ballots as \u201cwitnesses,\u201d and listed the same one-bedroom apartment as their address.\n\nIn other words, either a small group of benevolent democracy enthusiasts rented a place together and then traveled all over Bladen County to help strangers vote\u2014or someone, somewhere was cheating. In late November, the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted to delay certification of the result until it could figure out what, exactly, had gone awry here.\n\nThe answer, it turned out, involved one Leslie McRae Dowless Jr., a longtime fixture of Bladen County politics who worked as a contractor for Mark Harris\u2019s campaign. And Dowless, it turned out, paid a team to go door-to-door in mostly rural areas, collect unfinished absentee ballots from unsuspecting voters, and bring them to him for completion. In a series of sworn affidavits, witnesses stated that Dowless described himself as \u201cdoing absentee\u201d for Harris, and bragged that he was being paid in cash.\n\nIt appears that Dowless ran versions of this grift in previous contests, too. Since 2010, officials received at least a half-dozen complaints about his shady practices in the region, according to the AP. In the 2016 GOP primary, the candidate for whom Dowless worked won 98 percent of Bladen County absentee-by-mail votes, as documented by WSOC-TV reporter Joe Bruno. Two years later, when Harris won the 2018 primary, he took home 96 percent of absentee-by-mail votes in\u2014where else?\u2014Bladen County. (In retrospect, it is good for democracy that officials eventually uncovered Dowless\u2019s operation, but kind of embarrassing that it took them this long to do it.)\n\nThe Board of Elections\u2019 efforts to look into all this were complicated by the fact that in December, a court order dissolved it as part of a separate legal battle over the Board\u2019s composition and jurisdiction. North Carolina\u2019s governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, wasn\u2019t able to convene a new board until late January. In the meantime, the race entered a weird state of political limbo. Harris argued that he should be allowed to serve in Congress pending the investigation\u2019s results, and sued to compel certification in January. A state court judge, however, ruled that a hypothetical future Board, not a court, would be \u201cin the best position to weigh the legal and factual issues\u201d of the case.\n\nWhen that new Board finally held a hearing in February, state officials characterized Dowless\u2019s scheme as a \u201ccoordinated, unlawful, and substantially-resourced\u201d one. It apparently worked by getting voters to request absentee ballots, and then attempting to harvest and tamper with those ballots prior to their completion by the actual voter. According to the Charlotte Observer, the Harris campaign paid Dowless, through a consulting firm called the Red Dome Group, $4 per absentee ballot request in the primary and $5 per absentee ballot request in the general.\n\nIn all, the Red Dome Group paid Dowless $131,375, the Observer says; all but around $18,000 of that sum related to his work for Harris. Red Dome Group owner Andy Yates admitted that he didn\u2019t perform a background check on Dowless, which would have revealed a prior felony conviction for fraud, and failed to use Dowless\u2019s full name when he ran a cursory Google search. (Dowless often goes by his middle name, McRae.)", "description": "It\u2019s been nine months, and the district still doesn\u2019t have a congressional representative.
