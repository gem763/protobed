But for them, the campaign to remove the president is nothing new.\n\nOn September 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced that the House of Representatives \u201cis moving forward with an impeachment inquiry.\u201d Her declaration followed the revelation of a July phone call where President Trump asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nAccording to celebrities, there was no need for an \u201cinquiry.\u201d The president was guilty.\n\nIn response, Star Trek actor George Takei issued a flood of tweets.\n\n\u201cTrump keeps saying there was no \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 in the call,\u201d he said in one. \u201cBut asking ANY foreign government to assist in an \u2018investigation\u2019 of your chief political rival is a clear abuse of office, especially after withholding aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeach the scoundrel,\u201d he concluded. In another tweet, he added, \u201cTrump sounds like a thug who might send guys to break your legs if you aren\u2019t very, very nice to him back.\u201d\n\nActress Padma Lakshmi, who was also once on Star Trek, exclaimed, \u201cFinally!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cWOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!\u201d added actress Alyssa Milano, while actor Mark Ruffalo shared a video clip of Nancy Pelosi along with \u201c#ImpeachTrump.\u201d\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin, who once attempted to mock Trump by holding his (fake) bloody, incarcerated head, tweeted a GIF of her dancing along with the words \u201c#ImpeachTrump.\u201d\n\nSinger Lizzo tweeted out, \u201cIm [peach emoji] ment.\u201d And, from the night before, BuzzFeed News host Sylvia Obell shared a video clip of Lizzo at a concert last night.\n\nBending over with her backside facing the crowd, Lizzo appeared to use her butt to symbolize a peach. To the delight of the audience, she pointed to her left, saying \u201cim,\u201d then to her butt, saying \u201cpeach,\u201d then to her right, saying \u201cment.\u201d\n\nOther tweets were more vulgar \u2013 in language, at least.\n\nActor John Early retweeted a 2017 tweet of himself dancing to \u201cF*** Donald Trump\u201d in front of the White House. \u201cEXTRA HORNY FOR IMPEACHMENT THIS MORNING,\u201d the text read.\n\nFilm record producer Adam Dorn tweeted, \u201cImpeach this a**hole immediately. During this horrible speech if need be. WOW. F*** Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nLikewise, TV writer David Slack added, \u201c#Impeach this corrupt failure and throw his ass out\u201d while actor John Roberts (Bob\u2019s Burgers) continued, \u201cLet\u2019s impeach this piece of s*** and shame him and his sh***y family in history books.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Chelsea Handler responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a truly beautiful thing that #ImpeachTrump and #NationalVoterRegistrationDay are both happening on the same day.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to comedian Lizz Winstead, \u201cTrump was born with a silver goon in his mouth.\u201d At the same time, Samantha Bee predicted of the president, \u201cHe\u2019s going to have an absolute conniption!\u201d\n\nOther comedians, like Rosie O\u2019Donnell, added, \u201c#ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Nancy Pelosi,\u201d she said in an accompanying video clip. \u201cI never thought this day would come.\u201d\n\nActress Debra Messing similarly echoed, \u201cTHANK YOU @SpeakerPelosi.\u201d\n\nAlready assuming the removal of President Trump, actress Elizabeth Banks remarked, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Mike Pence is gonna be President.\u201d Likewise, director Ava DuVernay tweeted, \u201cWe are dressed and ready for the #ImpeachmentParty.\u201d\n\nAll in the Family actor Rob Reiner chimed in too.\n\n\u201cVirtually every elected member of the GOP knows this President has committed numerous Impeachable offenses,\u201d he typed. \u201cThe time has come. They will either honor their oaths to our Constitution or be relegated to the dust bin of History.\u201d\n\nActor Jon Cryer similarly agreed, \u201cWe cannot let the impeachment inquiry be limited to solely the Ukraine allegations.\u201d\n\nAt first, actress and model Chrissy Teigen responded, \u201cI don't get it just call me when it's over.\u201d She added later, \u201cIt\u2019s actually simpler than most of the s*** he\u2019s done. Love it! Happy great day to the haters and losers!! Not sad!!\u201d\n\nDirector Michael Moore urged, \u201cKeep the Impeachment SIMPLE\u201d and \u201cMove on to removing Trump 11/3/20.\u201d\n\nThis is something many figures in Hollywood have long been pushing for: impeachment. As NewsBusters has documented, celebrities went wild for #ImpeachTrump Day back in June. Throughout the year, they have been calling for his impeachment \u2013 and even for him to be assaulted and tortured.\n\nNancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement might be making news. But for many of the celebrities, their reaction is nothing new.", "description": "Editor's note: The following piece contains graphic language.Celebrities from George .09/26/2019 16:51:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/126/34e8a2ab-2fd6-47b3-94c7-a33a43ac1a73.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
