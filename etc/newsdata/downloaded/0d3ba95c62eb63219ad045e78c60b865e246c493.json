Nothing compares to the happiness and meaning she has given to our lives.\n\nDuring this National Adoption Week, the simple message is this: If you have room in your home \u2013 and more importantly in your heart \u2013 to consider adopting a child who needs a loving family, we want to hear from you.\n\nAt every time in every age there have been children in need of care from people other than their biological parents. Because of the impact of drug and alcohol misuse, social and economic deprivation, violence, abuse and mental health issues \u2013 2019 is no different.\n\n\u2018Looked-after\u2019 kids is one of the biggest oxymorons in public life. Too many children in care are neglected of the love and the attention they need to flourish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, there are children in desperate need of a new start. Most are under five years old.\n\nIn London, there is a particular need to find homes for children described as \u2018hard to place\u2019. This includes children from our diverse communities, in sibling groups of two or more, as well as those children with disabilities or special needs.\n\nGiving these children a new start will not only enrich their lives and your own, it contributes to making our society a better and more loving place. Across the country, we are enduring the related crises of loneliness, depression, drug abuse and violent crime.\n\nThe need is pressing, children are waiting and the Government is not making adoption any easier\n\nCreating space for larger and more loving families through adoption will help us tackle this.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the myths about who can adopt. The profile of adopters is evolving.\n\nYour own background \u2013 ethnicity, class and religion \u2013 do not matter. In the year ending March 2018, 400 children were adopted by single adopters and a further 460 by same-sex couples.\n\nYou do need an open mind and an open heart, and to be prepared to make a long-term, loving commitment to a child who above all needs stability and understanding. If you tick these boxes then what comes next is down to you.\n\nThe assessment process with your agency offers time to think things through and consider the realities of the needs of the children, as well as enabling the adoption agency to assess whether you will make a good adopter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe need is pressing and children are waiting. And the Government is not making adoption any easier.\n\nIts decision to scrap the Adoption Register for England this year was baffling. The register had made it easier for children needing homes and adopters to meet.\n\nIn its final year, the Register linked up 275 children, who had waited months without a match, to find permanent families. I am one of many in Parliament who will scrutinise the Government\u2019s performance and the results of the new regional adoption agencies.\n\nIn the meantime, it is vital that everyday citizens who can volunteer to adopt make sure the gap is filled.\n\nAdopting a child is challenging but agencies can provide a range of training and support to adoptive families. This week Coram Ambitious for Adoption \u2013 the first regional adoption agency in London and part of the oldest children\u2019s charity \u2013 is holding its first Celebrate Success event to welcome adopters from across the capital.\n\nIt will launch new resources produced by The Adoptables, a group of adopted young people to help others to learn how to tell their story.\n\nI hope the stories you read today will show how people from all walks of life are becoming adopters and may inspire you to join us.\n\nYes, adopting a child will be one of the toughest things you will ever do, but it will be among the most rewarding too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need good people of every background, religion, age and ethnicity to start the process of adopting a child who needs a safe and loving home.\n\nIf you are interested, you can visit First4Adoption.org.uk to get advice and prepare and find out about Coram\u2019s next information evening at coramadoption.org.uk.\n\nMORE: Mum praised for sharing photo that sums up the reality of parenting\n\nMORE: Incredible foster mum teaches the black children she cares for about their heritage and culture\n\nMORE: Lydia Bright opens up about her future plans to foster children like her own parents did\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "David Lammy writes for National Adoption Week about adopting his daughter and why he encourages others to adopt, too.", "authors": ["David Lammy", "Labour Mp"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1135906681_1571039570.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
