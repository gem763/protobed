There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter or Joe, a frontrunner to be Trump's Democratic rival in the 2020 election.\n\nThe White House\u2019s release of the transcript came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., formally announced an impeachment probe into the president.\n\nThe Ukraine call is one part of a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's actions.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not an investigator. Nor am I a lawyer. I would hope that the White House turn over the whistleblower. They never should have stopped this complaint from going directly to Congress,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cI put this above my partisanship. I put this right where it should go, which is the protection of our democracy.\u201d\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER HAD INDICATIONS OF BIAS, SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the president met with world leaders at the United Nations, including Zelenskiy.\n\nIn an appearance before reporters, Zelenskiy said he did not want to get involved in an American election, but added, \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nIn the days before the controversial July phone call, Trump instructed his advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine. However, the aid package was not mentioned in the call.\n\nWATCH: PELOSI ADMITS SHE HASN'T READ THE UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Joe Biden said it was \u201ctragedy\u201d that the president was willing to \u201cput personal politics above his sacred oath.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also learned that he planned to involve the United States Department of Justice in this scheme -- a direct attack on the core independence of that department, an independence essential to the rule of law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is about the protection of our country,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cWhat has he learned over the last three years? What is he doing now to protect us from any foreign meddling in our current election season?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe told Hemmer and Smith: \u201cJoe Biden has answered these questions. The fact is that many people do not wish to hear the answer. \u2026 And yes, if some of the other Democrats would like to take this up, take it up. But for now, the president of the United States \u2026 needs to answer why he called upon the president of a foreign country to interfere and look into our election.\u201d", "description": "Former Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile said she found a newly released rough transcript of a 30-minute phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cdisturbing\u201d on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/25/694940094001_6089495240001_6089488462001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
