Last year, the company entered an agreement with the Canadian government, Alcoa and Apple to develop a carbon-free method of making aluminium.\n\nSteelmakers around the world are under increasing pressure to curb their emissions.\n\nIn Europe, carbon pricing has crimped steel mill profits, putting jobs at risk and forcing companies to look for alternatives to coal to save on emissions costs.\n\nBoth Rio Tinto and BHP have said they want to dramatically reduce their emissions but the strong language has so far not been enough to satisfy activists.\n\nRio Tinto says it supports the international Paris agreement, which is designed to keep the increase in global temperature below 2C, and is aiming for the \u201csubstantial decarbonisation\u201d of its entire business by 2050.\n\nThe Rio Tinto chief executive, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques, said the China Baowu deal would \u201cbring together solutions to help address the steel industry\u2019s carbon footprint and improve its environmental performance.\n\n\u201cThe materials we produce have an important role to play in the transition to a low carbon future and we are committed to partnering with our customers and others to find the most sustainable ways to produce, process and market them,\u201d he said.", "description": "Partnership is an attempt by the mining giant to curb its scope 3 emissions \u2013 those made by its customers", "authors": ["Ben Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027f9cc5870b6b12abd826b9f7762eb6336586fb/0_69_3291_1976/master/3291.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74d94997016637d5ed790ac12c0f0b62", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
