Man, I feel like someone smashed me in my temple on the side of the head. Get over it, man. It's over. You know? We were good in the preseason without him. We\u2019re going to be fine without him. And we wish him the best.\n\n\"You know, we gave it a shot. Now New England gets their turn. Good luck to them. I can't deal with it anymore.\"\n\nIt's understandable for Gruden to take that approach given everything he and the Raiders went through since acquiring Brown from the Pittsburgh Steelers in March.\n\nBrown missed the majority of training camp and the preseason after suffering frostbite on his feet after failing to wear proper footwear in a cryotherapy machine. He also found himself in a prolonged dispute with the NFL in hopes of being allowed to wear his helmet of choice, which is no longer approved by the league.\n\nThe 31-year-old was nearly suspended after he \"got into it\" with general manager Mike Mayock last Wednesday after publicly calling out the organization for fining him. Though the Raiders declined to suspend him for the Mayock incident, they did fine him.\n\nGruden found himself at the center of attention Friday when Brown posted a video of a private conversation between him and the coach, with Gruden telling the wideout to \"please stop this s--t and just play football\" (contains language NSFW):\n\nThe video also featured Gruden asking Brown if he wanted to be a Raider.\n\n\"Man, I've been trying to be a Raider since Day 1,\" Brown said. \"... I don't know why it's a question of me being a Raider. It's like, do you guys want me to be a Raider?\"\n\nLess than 12 hours after the video was published, though, Brown demanded his release after a fine voided the guaranteed money in his contract. The Raiders granted his request shortly thereafter.\n\nBrown went on to agree to a contract with New England within hours of his release from Oakland.\n\nReleasing Brown rid Gruden of what had grown to be a ceaseless headache. Now, Brown is headed to Foxboro, where Patriots coach Bill Belichick is known for running a no-nonsense operation.", "description": "Oakland Raiders coach  Jon Gruden  is ready to move on from the franchise's short-lived  Antonio Brown  era...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/418/hi-res-438cb784b577dc83ce9e67c3cd5cd164_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
