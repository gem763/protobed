But few of them were meaningful.\n\nArcuri denied that the \u201cfriends\u201d who said she\u2019d had an affair with Boris Johnson were actually her friends. She denied that she would have \u201cgabbed\u201d to them, even had they been, and denied that any of the public money flowing into her successive startups was influenced by her relationship with the then mayor of London, whatever that may have been. Both have refused to deny that it had been a sexual relationship.\n\nBefore he became PM, sex was already 'priced in' with Boris Johnson \u2013 voters knew what to expect\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re forgetting that Boris is personable,\u201d she announced, as if he were a labrador and it was impossible to tell whether he was humping you or saying hello. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he singled me out,\u201d she continued, which, if it was meant to indicate \u201che shagged everyone\u201d, was definitely novel.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to be \u201cdragged into this horrific scandal\u201d, which she\u2019s already in the middle of, and she didn\u2019t want her answer to be \u201cweaponised\u201d, which is what they call it in the new politics when evidence of behaviour is actually used against a person in a debate about the way they behave. Finally, \u201cI\u2019m not answering,\u201d she concluded, \u201cbecause the press has made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer.\u201d Ah, the pole! Only five minutes earlier, it had been just a bit of marketing genius, and also great for working her core muscles; now, after some quick rhetorical jiujitsu, the very attention she\u2019d been seeking for her brand was suddenly part of a patriarchal conspiracy. So on feminist grounds, she could take no further questions.\n\nIf the purpose of this interview was to clear the prime minister of impropriety, it didn\u2019t even try. If it was to clear Arcuri of dishonesty, it emphatically failed, as she openly admitted lying to the alt-right journalist Milo Yiannopoulos, before going on to spray \u201cfake news\u201d accusations at the rest of the press. If it was meant to bring any clarity to the events, foreign trips, public money and \u201cIT lessons\u201d being exchanged mainly between 2012 and 2013, it failed. It was both utterly murky and boringly transparent. It made no sense because it wasn\u2019t meant to. Prior to the interview, we had a constitutionally dishonest man denying this rumour, among others; now we have a woman refusing to deny it on the grounds of ersatz emancipation. Impossible to say whether this makes it more likely to have happened or not, but in a sense that isn\u2019t the question. The only interest now is in what will stick.\n\nPlay Video 0:37 Boris Johnson refuses to answer questions about Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 video\n\nBefore he became prime minister, commentators observed that sex was already \u201cpriced in\u201d with Johnson \u2013 voters knew what to expect. Extreme negligence around its consequences \u2013 being unable to number your own children, say \u2013 was also priced in. Adultery, divorce, skeletons in closets: this is a man whose relationships are so sketchy no one knew for sure who he\u2019d move into Downing Street with, having got there on the votes of a narrow but trenchant constituency who didn\u2019t care.\n\nAnd actually, a lot of people don\u2019t care, and never have, about any politician\u2019s personal life, being periodically rushed into having a reaction by pearl-clutching tabloids when the time for a scandal was politically expedient. Johnson has always banked on this, and always been proven right. Pre-Harvey Weinstein, it is unlikely that even groping allegations would have gained any traction. (Since Weinstein, of course, we have collectively, culturally managed to refine our idea of a private life: it can\u2019t be called private if not everyone agreed to it. This is a start.)\n\nJennifer Arcuri: five unanswered questions after TV interview Read more\n\nIndeed, prior to Arcuri it would have been hard to imagine the sex-related scandal that could have touched Johnson: when your entire self-fashioning is that you shag around, any further suggestion of the same is just proof that you are who you say you are. It is a unique distinction of the prime minister\u2019s that his carefully crafted image, built on mischievous lies, turned any fresh untruths into proof of his authenticity. I say \u201cdistinction\u201d without admiration but with a certain awe: veracity, if not sexual propriety, was always held to be key to high office. To jettison the requirement was stunningly radical.\n\nPlainly, though, this is a scandal that won\u2019t dissipate in a hurry. It has nothing to do with Arcuri\u2019s dancers\u2019 pole or even her Bavarian dirndl. The obvious problem is the suggestion of corruption: misuse of public funds, of public platforms, of trips undertaken on behalf of the British taxpayer. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nEvery time these details are waved away the impunity is underlined: there is, it turns out, a concrete difference between the vows taken between two private individuals and the codes of conduct undertaken between politicians and the state. It\u2019s the difference between Johnson\u2019s girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, slipping seamlessly into the centre of the Conservative party conference and Arcuri being unable to pass into history. Ultimately, these codes have meaning beyond trust and convention \u2013 they can be investigated and enforced. This is the hard edge where hustle meets its limits.\n\nCuriously, Arcuri herself \u2013 contrary to her own rationalisations \u2013 is not the focus of any of this ire. Scrabbling after public money, gatecrashing trade trips, these are all behaviours we\u2019d expect of a young startup in a hurry. She\u2019s protected by the same Ronseal as Johnson himself, doing what it says on her tin. But nowhere on Johnson\u2019s tin does it say, \u201cfails to declare information in the public interest\u201d, and this case won\u2019t die until the details have been hammered out.\n\n\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist", "description": "That the TV interview made no sense is not the point, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60726777549fa3153b43a6b1773d12345014ded7/62_0_2862_1717/master/2862.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d2adaea0bd03863b0151375619aaf213", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
