She listens to music or watches TV while she posts the same photos of millennial pink grids, flowers, and cotton candy clouds over and over. Each one is marked with the same user \u2014 escty, real name Bianca Devins \u2014 whose tagged photos have become a wall of beautiful images and hopeful messages.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday, July 14th, Devins was brutally murdered. Photos of the 17-year-old\u2019s body were posted to Instagram and then spread across Discord, 4chan, and Twitter. While some well-wishers flocked to her account to express their sadness and support for her family, Instagram became awash with ghoulish accounts dedicated to sharing the photos.\n\nAs Instagram engaged in a game of whack-a-mole to take down each new photo, Taylor was one of the dozen or so people who started up an account dedicated to cleaning Devins\u2019 profile. These accounts, mainly run by girls and young women, are determined to fight against a horrific form of digital vandalism. \u201cI wanted to do whatever I could to protect [Devins] and her family from having to go through any more pain and protect anyone from seeing the disgusting images,\u201d says Taylor. It also means they\u2019ve become volunteer moderators, regularly viewing disturbing photos, which some say is to the detriment of their own mental health.\n\nTag cleaners, as they call themselves, drown out gore, harassment, and more by flooding a user\u2019s tagged photos with pleasant images. It\u2019s benevolent spam. The most prolific accounts are usually reposting the same images ad nauseam in quick bursts. Randomfloweracc, run by a 17-year-old named Lori, uses cartoons like Rilakkuma or Hello Kitty. Naomi, owner of cute.cleanup, is also partial to Sanrio characters and rainbows.\n\nUser kanyewestnandos \u2014 who posts the same meme of the rapper in a Nando\u2019s \u2014 says tag cleaning offers protection that goes beyond simply reporting a malicious account. \u201cIt is harder to witch hunt the people who are posting graphic material because they can change their username,\u201d they say. \u201cAnd if they eventually end up getting reported they can make a new account.\u201d Some photos or disrespectful memes may not violate Instagram\u2019s rules, meaning they stay up. Another tag cleaner, a 15-year-old named Valerie, says that it\u2019s a fast way to push images to the bottom of an account. \u201cIf you just report, it is likely that it won\u2019t get taken down immediately and people will have enough time to save the picture and spread it, which is what we\u2019re trying to avoid,\u201d she says.\n\nInstagram appears to have removed all of the tagged photos of Devins\u2019 death, but there\u2019s little to stop abusers from creating new accounts and restarting the cycle again. In the days following her death, The Verge noticed waves of these photos, both originating from the same accounts constantly reposting, as well as multiple new accounts cropping up. Reports filed by The Verge usually resulted in photos being taken down in minutes; but in some cases, that\u2019s all it takes for any user to see them to begin with.\n\nReached for comment, an Instagram spokesperson told The Verge that \u201cin addition to technology we have in place to proactively find images of this tragic event, we urge the Instagram community to report violating accounts and content to us so we can take swift action.\u201d\n\nFor some of the tag cleaners patrolling Devins\u2019 account, that\u2019s unacceptable. \u201cTag cleaning in combination with mass reporting is the way to combat the trolls,\u201d says Naomi, one of the tag cleaners. \u201cIf we only relied on reporting, the tags would still be flooded with \u2018those photos\u2019 while IG removes them. Not to mention, IG doesn\u2019t always remove them or they take their sweet time. They also won\u2019t remove memes that don\u2019t use the graphic photo obviously because it doesn\u2019t break community guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe account holders The Verge spoke to say that though they\u2019ve never met Devins \u2014 many weren\u2019t even aware of her before her death \u2014 they feel a connection to her. For some, it\u2019s their close ages. Others see themselves, friends, or online influencers they follow in her. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to personally know Bianca to see that no one deserves this after they\u2019re gone, especially not their family,\u201d says Naomi. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that this tragedy had to be inundated with insensitive memes and sick people who get a laugh out of posting \u2018those photos.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven with their best intentions and desire to help, however, many of the tag cleaners The Verge spoke say they feel exhausted. Valerie says that Devins\u2019 death is devastating, even without the addition of the photos. \u201cHonestly, the whole situation has me overwhelmed,\u201d she says. Naomi describes the time posting and tagging and refreshing and reporting as draining. She doesn\u2019t encourage anyone to get into it blindly, especially for those putting themselves in a position to repeatedly see graphic content. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the squeamish, I particularly feel some level of desensitization from you know ... the internet and shock culture so I felt like I could do this.\u201d\n\nModeration is a difficult, sometimes even trauma-inducing job for anyone to take on, let alone as volunteers. For Instagram\u2019s tag cleaners, the growing community has proven to be invaluable. Naomi says she shoulders the burden so that others won\u2019t have to. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that there\u2019s others doing just as much as you,\u201d she says. It gives her a chance to rest and unplug \u201cfrom the insanity that is the internet.\u201d Then, when she feels like she can, she comes back and posts some more.", "description": "These accounts, mainly run by girls and young women, are determined to fight against a horrific form of digital vandalism.
