Sivan as saying cameras from the moon mission\u2019s orbiter had located the lander. \u201cIt must have been a hard landing,\u201d PTI quoted Sivan as saying.\n\nISRO officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe space agency said it lost touch with the Vikram lunar lander on Saturday as it made its final approach to the moon\u2019s south pole to deploy a rover to search for signs of water.\n\nA successful landing would have made India just the fourth country to land a vessel on the lunar surface, and only the third to operate a robotic rover there.\n\nA live stream in Kolkata, India, shows Chandrayaan2 landing on the lunar surface on Sept. 7, 2019.
