The reality is the Democratically controlled House under Speaker Nancy Pelosi already has had a productive year. It has passed legislation that would ban drilling off the coast of Florida, reform campaign finance and tighten background checks for gun buyers, among scores of other issues.\n\nCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 28, 2019\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is holding everything up. Rather than act as an obstructionist, McConnell should allow the Senate to make changes to the legislation and negotiate a final version with the House -- or vote the House legislation up or down. Until then, stick the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d label on McConnell\u2019s chest. Here are half a dozen key measures that have passed with House, usually with at least some Republican support, only to be buried by inaction in the Senate.\n\nThe Development Driller III, which drilled the relief well and pumped the cement to seal the Macondo well, the source of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil spill, is seen in the Gulf Of Mexico, off the coast of Louisiana, on the day well was declared dead. [GERALD HERBERT | Associated Press]\n\nSponsored by Republican Rep. Francis Rooney of Naples, the Protecting and Securing Florida\u2019s Coastline Act (HR 205) would permanently ban drilling off the state\u2019s west coast in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 248-180, with overwhelming Democratic support and all but one Florida Republican agreeing.\n\nThe inaction in McConnell\u2019s Senate? The bill has languished in committee for weeks.\n\nAR-15 style guns are displayed at the In Guns We Trust LLC booth during the Tampa Gun Show in Feb. 2018 at the State Fairgrounds. [URSO, CHRIS | ]\n\nThis common-sense gun bill (HR 8) would prohibit transferring a firearm between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer or similar agent first takes possession of the gun to conduct a background check. While allowing exceptions, such as giving a gun to a spouse, this legislation would close the so-called \"gun show loophole.'' It passed the House in February by a vote of 240-190 with eight Republicans in favor.\n\nThe inaction in McConnell\u2019s Senate? It has gone nowhere while McConnell awaits word from President Donald Trump on which gun safety regulations he would support.\n\nMarijuana grows at an indoor cannabis farm in Gardena, Calif. [RICHARD VOGEL | AP]\n\nFederal regulations make it nearly impossible for banks to handle the legitimate business of legal medical and recreational marijuana. The Secure And Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act (HR 1595) remedies that by prohibiting federal banking regulators from penalizing banks for dealing with legal marijuana business. It had such overwhelming House support -- including 91 Republicans -- that the chamber suspended rules to pass it quickly by a 321-103 vote.\n\nThe inaction in McConnell\u2019s Senate? It was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs last month.\n\nA Dreamers rally\n\nThis bill (HR 6) would grant recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 the \u201cDreamers\u2019\u201d who were born in another country and came to the United States as children \u2014 conditional permanent resident status for 10 years and cancel removal proceedings if they meet certain standards. It passed the House in early June by a vote of 237-187 with seven Republicans joining the majority.\n\nThe inaction in McConnell\u2019s Senate? The bill has been dormant since June.\n\nThis bill (HR 1) expands voter registration and voting access, makes Election Day a federal holiday and limits removing voters from voter rolls. It inhibits gerrymandering by helping states establish independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions. It also improves election security and reforms campaign finance, including a provision to eliminate \u201cZombie Campaign\u201d abuses, which have allowed former members of Congress to keep spending from their political committees long after leaving office. It passed the House in March by a vote of 234-193.\n\nThe inaction in McConnell\u2019s Senate? No action.\n\nShantel Walker, an employee at Papa John's, speaks to a rally Tuesday in front of a McDonald's in New York as the group pushing for a $15-an-hour wage announced new protests.\n\nThe Raise the Wage Act (HR 582) would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025. The federal wage hasn\u2019t gone up in a decade. In July, the bill passed the House by a vote of 231-199, with three Republicans in favor.\n\nThe inaction in McConnell\u2019s Senate? Dormant since July.\n\nEditorials are the institutional voice of the Tampa Bay Times.
