Perfection is over-rated.\n\n\"I can see where Instagram is coming from, but for as long as some of the most-followed accounts on Instagram are of heavily surgically 'improved' people, removing surgery filters won't really change that much.\"\n\nInstagram said it was unsure how long it would take to remove all of the filters but many users welcomed the ban.\n\n\"Most people just pass filters off as 'girls having fun' and to just let girls enjoy things - but when you haven't posted a photo without one of these filters since 2016, then it clearly is something deeper than just 'fun',\" one user said on Twitter.\n\nHowever, some users said they would miss the effects.\n\n\"Has Instagram also considered me and what I'm supposed to do when I'm having a day where I look more clapped than normal? Old haggard witches need to look stunning too,\" tweeted one.\n\nResearch suggests excessive use of social media can cause feelings of depression - although some dispute those claims.\n\nIn February, Instagram said it would remove all graphic images of self-harm from the platform, amid concerns they could affect young and vulnerable people.\n\nIt followed the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing graphic images of self-harm on the site.", "description": "Effects showing what people might look after surgery will go, amid concerns they harm mental health.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15B33/production/_109338888_surgery-filters-pic.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
