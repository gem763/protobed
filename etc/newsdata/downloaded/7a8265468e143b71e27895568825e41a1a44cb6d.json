Or you get what you want, and you don\u2019t know what you want.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since that speech, and pretty much every major BoJack Horseman character has confronted that problem in one way or another \u2014 but none so much as Princess Carolyn, whose talent and tenacity haven\u2019t been enough to make her life any easier. In recent seasons, she suffered several traumatic miscarriages. After deciding to adopt \u2014 a process that took time, energy, and money she didn\u2019t have \u2014 she finally ended up with a baby daughter.\n\nSo: Happy ending, right? Not quite. Princess Carolyn got what she wanted. Which means it\u2019s time for her to deal with realizing she doesn\u2019t know what she wants.\n\n\u201cThe New Client\u201d is a stressful, frenetic episode of BoJack Horseman, designed to evoke the stressful, frenetic pace of Princess Carolyn\u2019s life. She\u2019s still living in the Tabbywood apartment complex, though her place is now filled with baby toys. At the start of the episode, her nanny quits, frustrated at Princess Carolyn arriving home late again. Between her busy professional life and her responsibilities as a mother to a baby, it\u2019s obvious that Princess Carolyn is, characteristically, being stretched too thin \u2014 a problem embodied in the fact that she still hasn\u2019t found the energy to choose the right name for her daughter, who is still being called \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project.\u201d\n\nSome of Princess Carolyn\u2019s problems are very specific to her situation \u2014 like, say, the fact that her baby is a porcupine, who needs to be handled with oven mitts so her quills don\u2019t get stuck in Princess Carolyn\u2019s skin. But others will be universal to any parent of a newborn: The constant crying, the endless diaper changing, and the sense that you\u2019ve gotten about five seconds of sleep before the baby or the alarm clock drags you right out of bed again.\n\nPrincess Carolyn is being honored at a Manatee Fair photo shoot for Hollywood Women Who Have It All, alongside her perennial nemesis Vanessa Gekko. Idle chitchat turns into a plan for a women\u2019s event, which turns into a ball and/or gala reuniting the Fugeees, which inevitably falls at Princess Carolyn\u2019s feet. All the while, the episode represents how overtaxed Princess Carolyn is by dropping six or more versions of her into every scene: One tapping away on a cell phone, one rocking a baby, one shaking a rattle.\n\nShe needs a break \u2014 and eventually, if you refuse to take a break, the universe forces one upon you. When Princess Carolyn visits Pastiches to collect Mr. Peanutbutter, who is visiting BoJack in rehab to avoid his own problems, the front desk clerk mistakes her for a drug addict and checks her into the clinic, where she promptly passes out for two straight days.\n\nBut the universe doesn\u2019t let anybody \u2014 but particularly a woman \u2014 take two days for herself without consequences. Back in the real world, Princess Carolyn has missed the gala. Her client Flea Daniels is furious about the state of his Mr. Peanutbutter-starring movie Birthday Dad, which has been cut to ribbons against his wishes. Her baby is fine in Todd\u2019s care, but Todd has been running around town talking about \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project,\u201d which has sparked a ton of Hollywood rumormongering. (Sample dialogue: \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project\u201d has legs, \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project\u201d is making noise, \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project\u201d will live for at least several seasons.)\n\nOf course, Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet, so she finds a way to solve all her problems in one shot. She repackages Birthday Dad as a TV series, restoring the cut content while hyping the clout of Flea Daniels directing the pilot episode. \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project\u201d lives up to the hype, and her reputation remains untarnished. She even shows up for the aftermath of the gala, letting her guard down long enough to confide in Vanessa Gekko.\n\nAnd when Princess Carolyn confides, with a great deal of self-flagellation, that she thinks she\u2019s a better agent than a mother \u2014 and that she\u2019s terrified she\u2019ll never truly love her difficult, demanding child \u2014 Vanessa sets her straight. She tells Princess Carolyn to think of the baby as a client: Someone difficult and demanding who Princess Carolyn supports anyway because it\u2019s her job to do it.\n\nReturning home, Princess Carolyn discovers that her fast-talking work patter is enough to make her own baby laugh. In a way, she can do both at once. And with the pressure valve released, she also comes up with the perfect name for her daughter: Ruthie.\n\nIn case you don\u2019t remember: Ruthie is the name of the character voiced by Kristen Bell in season four, who was said to be Princess Carolyn\u2019s great-great-great-grandaughter reflecting fondly on her ancestor. In the end, the episode revealed \u2014 in a true gut punch \u2014 that the whole thing had been an elaborate fantasy Princess Carolyn cooked up to cope with the trauma of an awful day.\n\nBy playing with the structure of television, season four\u2019s \u201cRuthie\u201d ended on a heartbreaker: That, despite a lifetime of struggles and disappointments, there was no surefire happy ending waiting for Princess Carolyn. But by revisiting Ruthie \u2014 and turning her into an actual, flesh-and-blood character who will carry on Prince Carolyn\u2019s legacy \u2014 \u201cThe New Client\u201d is twisting that old, sad ending into a more positive direction: With confidence and willpower, you can create a version of the future you\u2019ve always imagined for yourself.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 The episode\u2019s B-plot centers on Mr. Peanutbutter, stewing in his own guilt after cheating on Pickles with Diane last season. Pickles doesn\u2019t know yet, but Mr. Peanutbutter is such an open book \u2014 and comes so very, very close to telling a room full of strangers about his affair in this episode \u2014 that it feels like this ticking time bomb will explode any minute.\n\n\u2022 After the truncated version that debuted in the season premiere, \u201cThe New Client\u201d gives us our first look at the show\u2019s new opening credits sequence. Now, instead of walking through an average day, the credits offer brief snapshots of BoJack\u2019s life, from his time starring on Horsin\u2019 Around to the premiere of Philbert, culminating in BoJack falling from the observatory where Sarah Lynn died. It\u2019s a clever way to quickly recap the highlights of the series for the final season, and to signal to viewers that the sometimes-superficial BoJack is delving much deeper into his past this time around.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s a particularly nice touch that Princess Carolyn \u2014 having heard the story of Taran Kotada\u2019s Hollywood career drying up after taking three weeks of maternity leave \u2014 ends up hiring Kotada as showrunner on Birthday Dad.\n\n\u2022 We get a few glimpses of Flea Daniels\u2019 The Diary of Anne Frankenstein, which stars Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz as Anne Frankenstein and Michael Shannon (not David Strathairn) as Zombie Igor. Moretz has a single line, but per the credits, she still voiced herself.\n\n\u2022 Pickles has amassed a slew of stans on social media who call themselves the Pickle Pack, and who eagerly make memes about her storybook romance with Mr. Peanutbutter. I wonder how they\u2019ll react if word ever gets out that Mr. Peanutbutter cheated on Pickles\u2026\n\n\u2022 The package of Milwaukee-based shows Pinky bought from Dick Wolf \u2014 which include Milwaukee Postal and Milwaukee Waste Management \u2014 turn out to be a ratings bust. I wonder: In the BoJack Horseman universe, is Dick Wolf a wolf? Or is this a Vanessa Gekko situation?\n\n\u2022 Like Mr. Peanutbutter, Dr. Champ\u2019s first name is Doctor. He might not even be a doctor.\n\n\u2022 The women of the Manatee Fair photo shoot on Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s Birthday Dad: \u201cThat sounds awfully masculine.\u201d \u201cDad.\u201d Mister.\u201d \u201cNut.\u201d \u201cPeen.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Are my eyes deceiving me, or is Todd eating a meal of spaghetti marinara with Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups mixed in at Elefante?\n\n\u2022 Todd, being told to name his price: \u201cUhhhh\u2026 Jonathan?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Todd cheerfully pronounces \u201ctoday\u201d as \u201cTodd Day!\u201d Of course he does.", "description": "Princess Carolyn got what she wanted, which means it\u2019s time for her to realize she doesn\u2019t know what she wants.
