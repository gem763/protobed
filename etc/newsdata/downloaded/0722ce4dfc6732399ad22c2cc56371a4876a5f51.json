The US military was not immediately available for comment.\n\nBut any suspension in such activities would represent a direct setback to the central US goal of helping the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) secure territory seized from Islamic State.\n\nRead more: The general who led the fight against ISIS says Trump's new policy 'breaks that trust' after years of hard fighting\n\n\n\nUS soldiers with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment execute nighttime fire missions with an M777A2 howitzer during a gun-raid mission with Iraqi Security Forces in Iraq, December 22, 2018.

US officials say the president felt US troops should not be caught in the middle of that fight, and Trump says he is fulfilling promises to withdraw the United States from \"endless\" Middle East wars.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters, considered terrorists by Turkey, have described the US decision as \"a stab in the back\". Spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF has been the backbone of the US-led campaign against Islamic State.\n\nThe US military had hoped to train SDF and other groups to create a stabilization force of 50,000-60,000 fighters to help prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. As of last month, the US military estimated it was perhaps about halfway toward that goal.\n\nA third official told Reuters that the SDF was still guarding prisons holding some 11,000 captured Islamic State fighters, but noted that a small number of SDF forces had relocated ahead of the expected Turkish offensive.\n\nUS officials have long feared that the SDF would be unable to continue guarding the facilities in the event of a major Turkish incursion into Syria.\n\nStill, Islamic State remnants could force the SDF to battle it as well.\n\nMembers of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stand together near Baghouz, Deir Al Zor province, Syria February 12, 2019 Rodi Said / REUTERS\n\nRead more: 'The President eats his own': Military veterans in Congress unload on Trump for abandoning a US ally in the ISIS fight\n\n\n\nJennifer Cafarella, research director at the Institute for the Study of War think-tank in Washington, said the SDF faced the likely prospect of having to fight on two fronts: against Turkish forces and remnants of Islamic State simultaneously.\n\n\"ISIS leader (Abu Bakr al-)Baghdadi is undoubtedly prepared for this moment,\" Cafarella said, using an acronym for Islamic State.\n\nAt the height of its power Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through cities and towns along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad in neighboring Iraq.\n\nBut the fall in 2017 of Mosul and Raqqa, its strongholds in Iraq and Syria respectively, stripped Baghdadi of the trappings of a caliph and turned him into a fugitive thought to be moving along the desert border between Iraq and Syria.\n\nUS officials have been warning for months against losing focus on Islamic State, which they believe could again become a potent insurgency.\n\n(Reporting by Phil Stewart and Ellen Francis; Editing by Chris Reese and Peter Graff)", "description": "\"The SDF stopped the anti-ISIS operations because it's impossible to carry out any operation,\" a Kurdish military source said.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Ellen Francis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e1bbc3b33a75ea00c28ae?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
