The vote would also mark the end of a protracted journey for the men, who served a collective 120 years in prison and have waited as long as 20 months for the state to respond to their petitions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased that the board has moved to get this underway and to get it wrapped up,\u201d said Kristen Lloyd, an attorney for Hubert James Williams, 67, who served 11 years for an attempted murder.\n\nAD\n\nWilliams, who is being treated for drug addiction and has frequently been homeless since his release, signed papers to accept the offer on Friday, Lloyd said, while \u201ccrying happy tears.\u201d\n\nThe other four men \u2014 Lamar Johnson, Jerome Johnson, Walter Lomax and Clarence Shipley Jr. \u2014 have accepted the state\u2019s offer in principle, they or their attorneys said.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge development for James. It means life or death for him,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt means he won\u2019t be living on the streets, and he can get the help that he has desperately needed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) said two weeks ago that the state would decide by month\u2019s end how much to offer the men, who were seeking $12 million, or roughly $100,000 per year of incarceration.\n\nThe men would receive their first payment 30 days after the settlement is approved by the Board of Public Works. The offer covers money for each year the men served after sentencing, not their pretrial detention.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow I can finally move forward with my life,\u201d said Lamar Johnson, 36, who was freed in 2017. \u201cJust trying to put the last 13\u00bd years behind me and rebuild my life.\u201d\n\nHe said he plans to buy his mother a house and start his own business, buying houses in Baltimore to renovate and rent. He currently does maintenance work for Blue Ocean, a real estate company that has worked to help the exonerees.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI plan on getting some counseling, too,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m blessed to get the money and I\u2019m blessed to have my freedom, I still deal with depression. . . . As time goes on, maybe I\u2019ll stop feeling like that.\u201d\n\nLomax, 71, who was incarcerated for 39 years, said Tuesday that he has agreed to all of the state\u2019s terms. Neel Lalchandani, an attorney representing Shipley, 48, and Jerome Johnson, 51, said his clients have reached an agreement with the state \u201cin principle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJerome Johnson, who served 29 years, is also suing the Baltimore Police Department, alleging that officers purposely withheld evidence in the 1988 killing of Aaron Taylor, for which he was wrongly convicted.\n\nAD\n\nHogan decided to compensate the men after weeks of pressure from Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) and Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D) \u2014 who serve with him on the Board of Public Works \u2014 as well as dozens of state lawmakers, including new House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County).\n\nHogan initially said the panel was not equipped to respond to the requests and asked Maryland\u2019s chief administrative law judge to work with the board\u2019s general counsel to put in place a procedure for compensating the men and future exonerees.\n\nThe governor was later told that creating a procedure was \u201ccomplicated\u201d and would take more time than he was willing to wait. He then instructed the general counsel to work on a settlement offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSusan O\u2019Brien, a spokeswoman for Franchot, said Tuesday that the comptroller was glad that a resolution was reached to address \u201cthese profound injustices.\n\n\u201cWhile we cannot recapture the years these men lost from their lives, he hopes they have productive and successful lives as they move forward,\u201d she said.\n\nMaryland has paid a total of $3 million to seven exonerees since the General Assembly passed a law allowing such compensation in 1963, according to a Board of Public Works official, Sheila McDonald.\n\nBefore Lomax\u2019s award, the largest was $1.4 million, paid over 10 years, to Michael Austin. That settlement, approved by the Board of Public Works in 2004, was equivalent to $194 per day in today\u2019s dollars, or $70,810 a year for the nearly 27 years Austin was incarcerated.", "description": "The men collectively spent 120 years in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.", "authors": ["Ovetta Wiggins", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/C3J_4DrJtqqZbaMszqD5xCj4gMk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TTZLVOGVQII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
