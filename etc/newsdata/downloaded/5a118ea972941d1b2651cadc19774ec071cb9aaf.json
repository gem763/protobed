The same former vice president who says that his son, Hunter, was hired by the Ukrainian oil and gas company because of his expertise in energy policy is now claiming that President Trump has \u201csquandered\u201d the strong Obama economy he inherited.\n\nHere is how Mr. Biden put it in a speech last week in Scranton, Pennsylvania: \u201cDonald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me.\u201d Then he added: \u201cThings were beginning to really move. And just like everything else he\u2019s inherited, he\u2019s in the midst of squandering it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Jimmy Carter taking credit for the Reagan boom?\n\nThis is the continuing history rewrite of the left to explain the booming economy in the third year of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Today we are at or below record levels of unemployment, inflation and interest rates in half-a-century. Wages and salaries are rising at their fastest clip in at least two decades. There are an all-time high 7 million unfilled jobs in the United States. But, according to Gary Burtless of the liberal Brookings Institution, this is all just \u201ca continuation of the trend\u201d under President Obama.\n\nThe Washington Post is freaking out about the continued good news on the economy \u2014 and especially the latest data \u2014 that I reported on these pages two weeks ago that median household income is up by $5,003 since Mr. Trump became president. This was based on Census data, but The Post ranted last week that Donald Trump continues to \u201cinflate his own numbers.\u201d Nearly every assertion in the article was wrong or twisted \u2014 and Mr. Trump was right.\n\nWhat is especially rich in the claims by The Washington Post and Joe Biden and others that Mr. Trump\u2019s success is just a continuation of the Obama economy is that this time three years ago these same Trump haters promised that a Trump presidency would cause a \u201cglobal financial calamity\u201d and even a \u201csecond Great Depression.\u201d The stock market would \u201cnever\u201d recover from Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Paul Krugman of The New York Times assured us.\n\nNow, whoops, with the economy surging, all of a sudden, it is just Mr. Obama\u2019s doing. The double standard here is so transparent that only someone suffering from TDS \u2014 Trump Derangement Syndrome \u2014 would miss it. If the economy were crashing today, the left would say that it\u2019s all Mr. Trump\u2019s fault. But with the economy doing quit well, Mr. Obama gets the credit.\n\nThe continuation of the Obama trend argument is leaky at best. First, Mr. Obama gave us the weakest recovery from a recession since the end of World War II. The economy grew by about 14 percent in the Obama recovery over seven years. In the normal recovery, the economy grew by almost twice that amount, or 27 percent. In the last Obama year, the economy slowed down to a piddly 1.6 percent growth and economists warned that a \u201crecessions is right around the corner.\u201d\n\nYes, Mr. Biden is right that at the end of the Obama-Biden presidency, \u201cthings were really starting to move\u201d \u2014 in the wrong direction. This is why Mr. Trump won the election. Nearly every poll in 2016 showed that jobs and the economy were the biggest worries of the American voters \u2014 especially in the Midwestern states that Mr. Trump flipped from blue to red.\n\nIncome growth had grown in Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, but it flattened out in 2016 \u2014 and the surge in middle-class incomes started to accelerate in early 2017, after Mr. Trump took office.\n\nMiddle-class incomes have grown almost three times faster under Mr. Trump than Mr. Obama. This is like trading in a Pinto for a Porsche and as you are flying 80 miles down the highway saying this is just a trend.\n\nSmall business and consumer confidence as well as the stock market surged in the days after the Trump election and have stayed high ever since. Coincidence? Hardly.\n\nMore to the point, most of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies have been to reverse Obama policies \u2014 not to continue them. Mr. Obama raised tax rates, Mr. Trump cut them. Mr. Obama grew regulations at a record pace, Mr. Trump has been rescinding them at a record pace. Mr. Obama negotiated the Paris Climate Accord \u2014 a $100 billion tax on the American economy \u2014 and Mr. Trump smartly pulled us out.\n\nMr. Obama passed Obamacare, Mr. Trump has been everyday finding ways around the law they called the Affordable Care Act, in order to reverse stampeding health costs and try to make health care \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nThe economy is far from perfect and the latest weakness in industrial production, for example, are worrisome. The China trade standoff has clearly slowed growth in Mr. Trump\u2019s third year in office. I would never say never to a recession in the next year or two \u2014 but I\u2019m with Larry Kudlow \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem likely right now.\n\nBut the biggest threat to the economy right now is that we repeal the Trump growth policies and return to Obamanomics. This is what Mr. Biden is promising, and if it comes to pass we will learn the bitter lesson that the good old days under Mr. Obama \u2014 really weren\u2019t so good at all.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore, a columnist for The Washington Times, is an economic consultant with FreedomWorks and served as a senior economic adviser to Donald Trump.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
