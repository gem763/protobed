He raised about $2.8 million in April, May, and June.\n\nMr. Yang, a tech entrepreneur, invited the public during last week\u2019s debate to go to his website and explain how $1,000 per month could help them. His \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d proposal is one of Mr. Yang\u2019s best-known policy priorities.\n\nOn Sunday, he defended the legality of the offer, saying he had lawyers who signed off on it.\n\n\u201cBut I do want to reflect for a moment \u2026 on the fact that if I gave a million dollars to media company or consultants or hired like a small army of canvassers, no one would blink an eye, but if we give the money directly to the American people, somehow that\u2019s problematic,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cSo, it just speaks to how messed up our system is where giving money directly to Americans actually raises eyebrows.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
