Trump claims that Biden tried to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating a company where Hunter Biden served on the board. But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate in Ukraine say the official, Viktor Shokin, was ousted for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim.\n\nImpeachment pressure: Trump says China should investigate Joe Biden, family\n\nHunter Biden, seen here with his father, former Vice President Joe Biden at a 2010 basketball game, has remarried, the family confirmed Wednesday. (Photo: Nick Wass/AP)\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump called Biden and his son \"stone cold crooked.\"\n\nBut Biden fiercely defended his family during the Reno campaign rally.\n\n\u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me. I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\"I think it's the beginning not the end,\u201d Biden said about what he anticipates will be more attacks against his family.\n\n\"I'm also confident the American people know me, and they know my son.\"\n\nBiden said his son will be a visible part of the campaign.\n\nUkraine explained: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\n\"He's a fine man. He's been through hell.\"\n\nBiden's wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972, just weeks after he won his first Senate race. In 2015, his oldest son Beau Biden, 46, died from a deadly form of brain cancer.\n\nBiden said Trump\u2019s attacks are tough but won\u2019t stop him from winning come November.\n\n\"Look, we are a family. We have been through a lot worse,\" Biden said. \"We know what real pain is.\"\n\nImpeachment poll: By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Kristin Sumbot, who died of brain cancer in 2017.
