Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker trailer shot-by-shot breakdown 1/13 Who are you, Rey? It seems extremely likely (some might even say crystal clear) that The Rise of Skywalker will shed light on Rey's origins \u2013 namely her possible Skywalker heritage. It is unknown exactly how this will play out, though. Is Rey a Skywalker by blood, or by spirit? YouTube / Star Wars 2/13 The return of the lightsaber Rey still has the blue lightsaber she inherited from Luke! And it works! YouTube / Star Wars 3/13 This fighter means trouble It definitely looks like the fighter Rey is about to jump over (and presumably damage with her lightsaber) is Kylo Ren's. YouTube / Star Wars 4/13 Dark warrior Speaking of Kylo Ren, what is he up to? Well, he's definitely up to no good. And he's accompanied by a Stromtrooper, which rarely means good news.

YouTube / Star Wars 11/13 Leia's return Carrie Fisher's Leia can be seen in the trailer giving Rey a heartfelt hug. Deleted scenes from The Force Awakens were used in order to feature Fisher, who died in December 2016, without resorting to CGI.

YouTube / Star Wars\n\nLate last month, Abrams denied speculation that his return to the director\u2019s chair was a response to the backlash aimed at 2017\u2019s The Last Jedi, which was directed by Rian Johnson.\n\n\u201cI never found myself trying to repair anything,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIf I had done [The Last Jedi], I would have done things differently, just as Rian would have done things differently if he had done [The Force Awakens].\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf you come back into it, you have to honour what\u2019s been done.\u201d\n\nIt has also been claimed that The Rise of Skywalker will be driven by the \u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d between Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey and Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren.\n\nSpeaking to Empire Magazine, the film\u2019s co-screenwriter Chris Terrio said that their dynamic will fuel the tension at the heart of the film.\n\n\u201cSome of the most interesting scenes in The Last Jedi are the conversations between Rey and Ren, [and] we\u2019ve tried to pick up that complicated relationship that really has been present ever since the interrogation in [The Force Awakens].\u201d\n\nStar Wars: Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker will be released 16 December.", "description": "Disney has confirmed the release date for the final trailer for Star Wars: Episode IX\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The Rise of Skywalker.
