The article tantalizingly noted that aerospace billionaire Robert Bigelow, whose interest in UFOs is no secret, modified buildings to house \u201cmetal alloys and other materials\u2026that [allegedly] had been recovered from unidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d\n\nThese \"alien alloys\" quickly became the topic of great intrigue. DeLonge's To the Stars Academy, a UFO research outfit that may or may not be broke, said that it has recently acquired some metamaterials, though it's not clear whether they are the same ones referenced in the NY Times article.\n\n\u201cThe structure and composition of these materials are not from any known existing military or commercial application,\u201d Steve Justice, To The Stars Academy's COO and former head of Advanced Systems at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works said in a statement. \u201cThey've been collected from sources with varying levels of chain-of-custody documentation, so we are focusing on verifiable facts and working to develop independent scientific proof of the materials' properties and attributes. In some cases, the manufacturing technology required to fabricate the material is only now becoming available.\"\n\nJustice said that the organization wants to reverse engineer the metals with hopes of manufacturing more of them.\n\nThe press release related to these metals is incredibly vague\u2014little information is given regarding the physical characteristics of the materials nor does it provide any data which even suggests the materials are truly \u201cground-breaking.\u201d\n\nIn the press release, Justice said that the materials have \u201cbeen collected from sources with varying levels of chain-of-custody documentation, so we are focusing on verifiable facts and working to develop independent scientific proof of the materials' properties and attributes.\u201d\n\nAccording to the press release, some of these materials were in the possession of investigative journalist and UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe, who, in 2004, gave a presentation at the Xcon Conference regarding these materials. In her lecture, a video of which has been on the internet for years, she suggests that the material could become a \u201clifting body\u201d with the right amount of electromagnetic static and certain RF frequency. These are undoubtedly the same materials mentioned by DeLonge on his Joe Rogan interview where he stated, \u201cif you hit it with enough terahertz, it\u2019ll float.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Motherboard, Dr. Chris Cogswell, who hosts the Mad Scientist Podcast and who holds a PhD in Chemical Engineering, explained that we need to be incredibly cautious before jumping to conclusions. He expressed that layered magnesium and bismuth alloys are pretty common and are certainly easily explainable by science.\n\n\u201cMicrometer thick layers are made by mistake in metallurgy facilities all the time. The purification of lead by removing bismuth using magnesium is a perfectly reasonable explanation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that if these materials are truly exotic, then initial results should come relatively quickly: \"The facilities to analyze these solids are readily available. If they have materials, we should be seeing progress because these tests would take all of a month to run and analyze to see if there is something worth pursuing.\"\n\nAny claims of actual evidence related to UFOs should be taken skeptically, of course, but To the Stars has in the past been the first to publish video of military pilots seeing UFOs, so its claims cannot be dismissed immediately out of hand. It's also worth noting that there are, of course, many materials scientists working on new alloys and composites all the time.\n\nUntil some actual rigorous third party scientific testing occurs, or a peer-reviewed paper in an academic journal is published, the best course of action here is to just wait and see.", "description": "It hasn't posted any proof yet, but the former Blink 182 singer's group says it is currently studying materials to see if they came from a UFO.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d3b20beae3a1e0008c0a227/lede/1564157478151-Screen-Shot-2019-07-26-at-114921-AM.jpeg?crop=0.6398xw:1xh;0.1997xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-07-26"}
