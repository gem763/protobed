Before I jump into today\u2019s topic, let\u2019s catch up a bit. I\u2019ve been on a bit of a startup profile kick as of late. Last week, I was tired from Disrupt. Before that, I wrote about up and coming telemedicine company Alpha Medical.\n\nRemember, you can send me tips, suggestions and feedback to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or on Twitter @KateClarkTweets. If you don\u2019t subscribe to Startups Weekly yet, you can do that here.\n\nStartup Spotlight\n\nY Combinator\u2019s latest batch concluded two months ago, which means my inbox is beginning to fill with pitches from companies ready to talk about the first rounds of fundraising. We\u2019ve profiled many of the companies already, like Tandem, Narrator, SannTek Labs and more to come.\n\nThis week, I have some notes on Revel, a recent grad from the hot accelerator network that plans to create a nationwide subscription-based network tailored to women over the age of 50. The startup\u2019s founders, Harvard Business School graduates Lisa Marron and Alexa Wahl, say there are no good existing options in the market to help women in this demographic foster new relationships.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the things that exist are nonprofits that are a little antiquated now,\u201d Marron tells TechCrunch. \u201cI think we saw that those are really serving the need of our members\u2019 parents\u2019 generation, but they haven\u2019t really adapted as much to the modern age.\u201d\n\nWomen 50 years and older can become a member of Revel. For now, the service is free, though the company plans to charge a $100 annual fee in the coming months. Currently, Revel\u2019s community includes 500 women. With a $2.5 million funding led by Forerunner Ventures\u2019 Kirsten Green, the small team plans to expand within the Bay Area. They said they won\u2019t begin establishing Revel outside the region until they raise a Series A.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine women will stay committed to paying an annual Revel membership, considering the real value comes from the company\u2019s ability to facilitate introductions to like-minded women. Once those introductions have been made, women can discontinue their membership and develop relationships outside the service. Forerunner Ventures, however, is known for backing successful and prominent brands, like Glossier, Warby Parker and Outdoor Voices. My guess is Revel has ambitions to become the brand representing women over 50 seeking meaningful connections.\n\n\u201cWe want to take this wide in a short number of years because we feel there is a need and opportunity to build this strong community for women of this age; venture capital in that sense was rocket fuel,\u201d adds Marron.\n\nUber plans to buy a majority stake in a Latin American grocery delivery business called Cornershop. The Chilean startup was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas. It will continue to operate under that leadership in its current form for now, says Uber.\n\nTo beat Amazon Go, Standard Cognition is buying DeepMagic, a pioneer in autonomous retail kiosks. \u201cThe $86 million-funded Standard Cognition is racing to equip storefronts with an independent alternative using cameras to track what customers grab and charge them. But Amazon\u2019s early start in the space poses a risk that it could patent troll the startup,\u201d writes TechCrunch\u2019s Josh Constine.\n\nExtra Crunch subscribers have a lot to chew on this week. Reminder, if you haven\u2019t yet signed up for our premium content service, you still can here.\n\nThis week, I wrote about the importance of having a culture expert on staff at a venture capital firm. Increasingly, startups are being judged for their cultures, diversity of staff and more. VCs, for the most part, are unprepared to help their companies foster more inclusive environments, and that\u2019s a problem. One firm, True Ventures, has taken a big step toward holding their companies accountable for culture and giving them real resources to help them improve things early. I talked to True Ventures\u2019 Madeline Kolbe Saltzman about her new title, VP of Culture.\n\nI took a break from Equity this week, but my co-host Alex Wilhelm was in studio with IPO expert James Clark. Listen to the excellent conversation here.\n\nEquity drops every Friday at 6:00 am PT, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.", "description": "In this week's newsletter: Uber buys Cornershop and two startups named Revel raised VC dollars.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-11-at-3.19.51-PM.png?w=637", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
