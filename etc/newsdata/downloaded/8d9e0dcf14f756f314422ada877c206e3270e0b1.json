The homespun design features a Laura Ashley-esque floral pattern sewn over a parakeet green, faux-velvet base. No matter what anyone says, I love it.\n\nEven as the most questionable elements of noughties fashion sneak back into style (see: low-rise jeans, visible thongs, and chunky Steve Madden flip flops), The Real Monica Inc. remains a neglected footnote from the era.\n\nLewinsky\u2019s tote bags are relegated to the laundry list of her first awkward post-Clinton ventures, like working as a Jenny Craig spokesperson and hosting a questionable Fox dating show where male contestants competed for love\u2014in wrestler masks.\n\nKooky hustles aside, Lewinsky needed the money. In a 2000 New York Times feature, the former White House intern admitted that she started the collection to help get out of debt. Working through legal fees to the tune of $1.5 million, with a name the press mercilessly maligned for months, the amateur knitter had little to lose.\n\nThough every bag came with a tag that reads, \u201cMade just for you by Monica,\u201d that's not entirely true. According to the Times, Monica designed the handbags, but each one was handmade in a Louisiana plant.\n\nThe totes were stocked by New York's Henri Bendel, L.A.\u2019s Fred Segal, and the World Wide Web\u2019s TheRealMonicaInc.com.\n\nThat URL went dark in 2004. Bendel\u2019s closed last winter. In an email, representatives for Fred Segal wrote, \u201cUnfortunately we don\u2019t have an information on [the bags].\u201d\n\nThrough her representatives, Lewinsky (very kindly) declined to comment.\n\nWhen I began my search for a Real Monica bag, I found only three options readily for sale. Two came courtesy of eBay, and one lives on the consignment site Tradesy.\n\nBack in the day, these cost between $80 and $170. When I checked on Tradesy, one brown, baroque-printed hobo with fringe at the bottom was on sale for a very specific price of $32.57. The two eBay options cost $154 and $269, respectively.\n\nI hit up a few experts and consignment shopkeepers to help with my search. Many who responded were unaware that Lewinsky ever had a handbag line. A few sent over the eBay links I had already found.\n\n\u201cThese are collector\u2019s pieces for sure,\u201d Julie Ann Orsini, a fashion archivist, told me over the phone, before backtracking. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fashion collector\u2019s piece, let me make that distinction. You\u2019re not going to find these in any real, high-end, vintage stores.\u201d\n\nRichard Ives, who owns PilgrimVintage in New York, delivered this particularly blunt reply via email: \u201cWe deal in luxury and designer vintage handbags. Her bags were neither. Probably more likely to be in GoodWill or [The] Salvation Army.\u201d\n\nAbby Ellin wrote the aforementioned New York Times business story on Lewinsky. (Ellin has also contributed to The Daily Beast.) She also owns a Made by Monica tote of her own, which she keeps safely locked away in a Midtown storage facility.\n\nLewinsky gifted the columnist the leopard-printed number as a token of her appreciation for writing a respectful, nuanced profile. Articles like Ellin's were, of course, few and far between during a time when The New York Post infamously dubbed Lewinsky the \u201cportly pepperpot.\u201d\n\nOver in the politics section of the Times, Ellin\u2019s celebrated colleague Maureen Dowd won a Pulitzer for her obsessive coverage of Lewinsky. Dowd published all the slut-shaming fit to print. She also never passed up an opportunity to make a fat joke at the then 24-year-old\u2019s expense.\n\nAccording to Ellin, Lewinsky especially loved the fact that the Times legitimized the handbag company by calling her an \u201centrepreneur\u201d in its headline. Marcia Lewis, Lewinsky\u2019s mother, makes an appearance in the story, and she later called Ellin to thank her for the article.\n\n\u201c [The bags] look like two shmatas put together, with fringe and beads on it. They were fun\u2013that's the word, they were fun. \u201d \u2014 Abby Ellin\n\nThough most press at the time threw around the word \u201cboho\u201d when describing Lewinsky's designs, my 2019 interpretation is that these are decidedly not throwback pieces. They reek of the folksy \u201990s. The purse\u2019s hippie-meets-grunge aesthetic evokes Reality Bites-era Winona Ryder, another infamous name in the retail world.\n\n\u201cIt looks like two shmatas put together, with fringe and beads on it,\u201d Ellin says of her tote. \u201cThey were fun. That\u2019s the word\u2014they were fun.\u201d\n\nToday, Kate Coyne is the executive editor of People magazine. In 1999, she served as a Page Six columnist, where writers gleefully maligned Lewinsky at every opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe were not the kindest to Monica in a lot of ways that seem particularly cringeworthy and horrible when you look back now,\u201d Coyne recalled.\n\n\u201cWhile I can take some comfort knowing I personally never wrote any items about her or her appearance, I read those articles, saw them, and\u2014this is horrible to say\u2014probably laughed at some of the funnier terms and phrases,\u201d she added.\n\nOne night while working late, Coyne visited TheRealMonicaInc.com out of curiosity. To her slight surprise, she found the handbags \u201creally cute.\u201d She bought four\u2014one as a Christmas gift to her grandmother, another to give as a gag to a girlfriend about to take a job in D.C., and two to keep for herself.\n\nThose days, the reporter still got most of her tips through a fax machine, so the idea of online shopping seemed novel. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can officially say this, but it may be the first thing I bought online,\u201d Coyne said.\n\nBefore she left the website, Coyne visited Lewinsky\u2019s customer service page. There, she found a portal where shoppers could type in special requests, send questions, or complaints.\n\n\u201cI typed a little note to her, what was essentially an apology on behalf of the New York Post,\u201d Coyne said. \u201cIt did force me to reckon with the reality of what I did for a living. Being a girl the same age that she was, I definitely felt for her.\u201d\n\n\u201c They\u2019re good bags. They\u2019ve officially reached the status where if I ever lost one, I would be very, very mad. \u201d\n\nLewinsky never replied. But Coyne still happily uses her Made by Monica bags for storage. One holds bathing suits and the other is reserved for paint supplies. Her mother had a \u201cripoff Missoni rainbow print\u201d version that Coyne has since stolen and keeps as her own.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re good bags,\u201d Coyne asserted. \u201cThey\u2019ve officially reached the status where if I ever lost one, I would be very, very mad.\u201d\n\nCoyne has used the hefty totes to carry clothes and toiletries for weekend trips. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty indestructible,\u201d the editor assessed. \u201cThey have stood the test of time; they haven\u2019t broken. Well, a button closure fell off of one, but my dog gnawed it off. That\u2019s not Monica\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I bought the $154 Made by Monica tote from an eBay seller who lives in Levittown, Pennsylvania. That faceless avatar is a speedy shipper, but they unfortunately did not return my request for comment\u2014so I know nothing about my new bag\u2019s origin.\n\nMaybe it lived on a Bendel shelf before the previous owner picked it up. Perhaps my seller bought it online, suspect of that new form of shipping, not knowing if it would ever arrive at her front door. Either way, it\u2019s mine now.\n\nSometimes women buy purses to signal a new era. You might splurge on a Chloe satchel when you get a new job. Your mom could buy you a Kate Spade work tote as a graduation gift. If you are Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, you get a mini Herm\u00e8s because you are a very big girl who just turned 1.\n\nI recently turned 24, the same age as Lewinsky was when the Clinton affair broke. Unless something goes very, very wrong, I doubt my year will be half as explosive as 1998 was for her.\n\nBut just like my handbag designer, I\u2019ve run errands for creepy bosses. I\u2019ve poured my heart out to people I mistakenly thought I could trust; none of them were wearing a wire, but betrayals still sting. No matter how much I smile or how charming I am, to some men I will never be more than \u201cthat woman.\u201d\n\nAnd, despite all that, just like Monica and so many other women in the world, each morning I wake up, get dressed, sling a packed purse over my shoulder, and head out the door.", "description": "In 1999, Monica Lewinsky launched a handbag collection.
