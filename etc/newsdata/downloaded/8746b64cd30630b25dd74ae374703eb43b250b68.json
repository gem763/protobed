The system will remain too far east,\u201d the NWS tweeted on 1 September.\n\nAsked later how the map, which featured the logo of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), had come to be doctored, Mr Trump said: \u201cNo ... I just know, I know Alabama was in the original forecast.\n\n\u201cThey thought they would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go \u2014 actually we have a better map than that which is going to be presented where we had many lines going directly, many models, each line being a model, and they were going directly through. And in all cases Alabama was hit.\u201d\n\nConfronted by a reporter again about the apparent use of a sharpie on the map, Mr Trump added: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe NOAA referred US media questions about the map to the White House press office, which has been contacted by The Independent for comment.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This forecast cone was from 5 days ago. Alabama was NEVER in the official cone from the [National Hurricane Center].\n\n\u201cThe sharpie-bubble was drawn by someone else. This map is inaccurate, misleading and fake.\u201d\n\nAny doctoring of an NHC map could also be illegal, as a US law on false weather reports states it is a violation to \"knowingly issue or publish any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau\".\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Mr Trump appeared to provide the \"better map\" when he tweeted a so-called spaghetti plot by the South Florida Water Management District, dated 28 August, showing Alabama potentially being affected by the hurricane.\n\nHowever, beneath the map was a note warning users the graph was superseded by NHC advisories.\n\n\u201cIf anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product,\u201d it added.\n\nThe graphic was also produced a full four days before Mr Trump on Sunday insisted Alabama \u201cmost likely\u201d would be hit by the record-breaking hurricane. By then, no forecasters were predicting any issue for the southern state, but Mr Trump at an emergency briefing claimed the information about Alabama \u201cjust came up, unfortunately\u201d.", "description": "Donald Trump has denied personally altering a map to support a false claim about Hurricane Dorian after a sharpie pen was spotted lying close-by on his desk.", "authors": ["Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/08/trump-map-2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
