PAUL, Minn. (AP) - The latest edition of \u201cEl Trafico\u201d will take place in the MLS playoffs, with the pair of powerhouse Los Angeles teams set to stage their biggest matchup yet.\n\nSebastian Lletget and Jonathan dos Santos scored four minutes apart midway through the second half, leading the Los Angeles Galaxy to a 2-1 victory over Minnesota in the first round of the MLS playoffs Sunday night to spoil United\u2019s postseason debut.\n\nJan Gregus gave the Loons life with his goal in the 87th minute, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Galaxy hung on to advance to face top seed Los Angeles FC on Thursday in the Western Conference semifinals and set up another \u201cEl Trafico\u201d derby between the Southern California rivals.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is excited for this game,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cI think everybody wanted this game.\n\nThe Galaxy are 2-0-3 against LAFC, which joined MLS in 2018 and set the league record this year with 72 points by going 21-4-9 in the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a special day,\u201d Lletget said.\n\nIn front of a frenzied crowd that filled up Allianz Field, the new-in-2019 stadium for the third-year MLS franchise, Minnesota had the fans roaring and groaning throughout the first half while largely owning the attack. Robin Lod had three prime chances, including a one-timer from the middle he sent sailing over the net.\n\nAll those missed scoring opportunities came back to haunt the Loons, when Ibrahimovic\u2019s close-range shot was blocked by Michael Boxall, and Lletget knocked in the rebound in the 71st minute. Then in the 75th minute, dos Santos let one fly for the lower right corner that was out of a diving goalkeeper Vito Mannone\u2019s reach. The 6-foot-5 Ibrahimovic leaped to grab the crossbar and briefly swung back and forth to celebrate what turned out to be the winning goal.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Loons were the only home team to lose in the first round. The five-time MLS champion Galaxy, returning to the playoffs after a two-year absence, were a tough draw despite their up-and-down regular season.\n\n\u201cThis game was the most difficult game we played this season,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cThey were good. They were confident. You could see that in their game.\u201d\n\nThe Loons started without under-the-weather leading scorer Darwin Quintero, one of their three designated players whose costs can exceed the salary cap. The 32-year-old midfielder subbed in early in the second half for a spark, but the home team couldn\u2019t quite muster enough.\n\n\u201cWe were the better team for large periods of the game,\u201d Minnesota coach Adrian Heath said. \u201cWe had the best chances all evening, and I can\u2019t remember Vito having to do anything until, maybe, the goal.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The latest edition of \"El Trafico\" will take place in the MLS playoffs, with the pair of powerhouse Los Angeles teams set to stage their biggest matchup yet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/mls_galaxy_minnesotaunited_soccer_46434_c0-280-3463-2300_s1200x700.jpg?d5b9ba537a8147a2531c3540f4a769e69fd48405", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
