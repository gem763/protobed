But then you have higher up executives like Zucker and other people, who are saying we gotta make profits \u2026 so it turns into like certain things that you do are trying just to attract viewers, then it becomes kind of a comedy show.\u201d\n\nCary Poarch, a CNN employee in the Washington bureau, says in the video: \u201cCNN purports to be facts first, and that\u2019s just not the case.\u201d\n\nIn another clip, CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says Mr. Zucker wants \u201cimpeachment every single day to be the top story [and] he wants impeachment above all else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate how everything is all Trump all the time now. Everyone at the network complains about it. They hate covering Trump every day,\u201d Ms. Sierra says. \u201cOur Democratic interviews are like softballs, compared to the Republicans.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
