I didn\u2019t need Gerardo Parra\u201d \u2014 the National who uses the song as his walk-up music and sparked the phenomenon \u2014 \u201cto introduce me to \u2018Baby Shark.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBuck was trading emails recently with a St. Louis Blues staffer, looking for tickets for the Baby Shark stage show coming to the Enterprise Center in St. Louis. \u201cI\u2019m pulling out every string I have to get five tickets,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf I had a walk-up song in 2019, it would be \u2018Baby Shark.' It\u2019s haunting, it\u2019s mesmerizing, it\u2019s catchy.\"\n\nBuck is on the call for his 22nd World Series, which begins Tuesday night, alongside partner John Smoltz, a former starting pitcher. Viewers can expect both broadcasters to revel in the pitching matchups in Games 1 and 2: the Houston Astros\u2019 Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander against Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals. Buck was surprised, though, that Las Vegas oddsmakers had installed the Astros as more than 2-1 favorites to win the series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that number,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be betting that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Buck will see Washington sports at its best this week with the Nationals playing in the city\u2019s first World Series in 86 years, he will also see District sports at, well, not its best, when he calls Thursday night\u2019s game between the 1-6 Redskins and the Minnesota Vikings, also on Fox.\n\n\u201cYes, well I like the way you phrased it,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t be quoted saying it\u2019s the best and worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with regard to the Redskins, you guys in D.C. know the story a hell of a lot better than I do,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just rinse and repeat. Troy [Aikman] and I were talking about it with [recently fired Redskins coach Jay Gruden] and knowing that it didn\u2019t work out. We both think the guy is a hell of a coach.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThursday\u2019s Redskins game in Minnesota against the Vikings will also be a meeting with former Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, which, under different circumstances would be a dominant story line in Washington. The Redskins\u2019 futility and the Nationals World Series run, though, has made the reunion feel like an afterthought.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a little different,\u201d Buck said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sort of a Daily Double for the Redskins with [former coach] Kyle Shanahan coming to town as the coach of the [San Francisco] 49ers last weekend. But it\u2019s worth saying that everything hasn\u2019t been rosy for Kirk Cousins in Minnesota, either.\"\n\nBuck will fly from Houston to Minneapolis Wednesday night after Game 2 and then on to D.C. after the football game Thursday night to be in D.C. for Game 3 Friday night.\n\nAD\n\nGame 1 of the World Series is Tuesday night with the first pitch scheduled for 8:08 p.m.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Buck this week will see Washington sports at its finest (the Nationals) and its not so finest (the Redskins).", "authors": ["Ben Strauss", "Sports", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/12xd6scGl_FwTmElm5LpwxGjm0U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GKQ6A5WIHII6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
