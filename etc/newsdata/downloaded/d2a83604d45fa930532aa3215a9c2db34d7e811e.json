The White House said the House needs to have a formal impeachment inquiry vote for the probe to be legitimate. Democrats don\u2019t agree.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he understands the White House decision, saying it\u2019s a result of the way Schiff and other Democrats have handled the impeachment inquiry, which he said has been an \u201cunfair and partisan process.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think about what the Democrats are trying to do: Impeach the president of the United States 13 months prior to an election, based on an anonymous whistle-blower with no firsthand knowledge who has a bias against the president,\u201d Jordan said, adding that he expects Sondland\u2019s testimony to reinforce that of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Kurt Volker last week.\n\nSondland, 62, is one the diplomats involved in numerous text messages released by the committees last week that show discussions about Trump\u2019s July phone call with Zelensky, which was the subject of at least one whistle-blower report. In the messages, diplomat William Taylor expressed concern about Trump pressuring Zelensky for a Biden investigation.\n\nIn the exchanges, Sondland told Taylor that Trump was not trying to use Ukraine\u2019s military aid as leverage.\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo of any kind,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have cited Sondland\u2019s text messages as proof that Trump did nothing wrong.\n\nTaylor, however, signaled in one message he might resign over frustration with how the situation was being handled.\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotelier and longtime Republican donor, has been vocal in his support for the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. He was appointed by Trump to the EU ambassadorship last year to succeed Obama appointee Anthony Gardner.\n\nMonday, the committee chairmen subpoenaed records, to be turned over by Oct. 15, from the Defense Department and White House budget office \u2014 and requested the same from the White House and Vice President Mike Pence last weekend.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 The White House on Tuesday sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying it will not cooperate with House Democrats\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
