She is just fuming that I 'didn't get Jamie recruiting' for her like she asked me to...\"\n\nThe mum-of-four, who is pregnant, said she wouldn't be saying anything else about the drama.\n\npoll loading Was Coleen right to publicly name Vardy as leak? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nShe added: \"On a more serious note I\u2019ve been inundated with messages from everyone but I\u2019m not saying anything more until we\u2019ve finished looking into this situation properly.\"\n\nDanielle didn't waste any time responding, tweeting back: \"@RebekahVardy do you mean like how the sun recruited you Luv! #secretwag.\n\n\"We are all entitled to our opinions and we all know it came from your account. Attacking me won\u2019t take that away another low blow by you #notagirlsgirl.\"\n\nIt comes just an hour after Danielle appeared on This Morning to say she thought Coleen's allegations were true because she's had \"run-ins\" with Rebekah.\n\nDanielle said: \"I wasn\u2019t that shocked. I\u2019ve had run-ins with Rebekah before over similar things. Obviously like everyone else you read it and are like 'oh my gosh', but I wasn\u2019t as shocked seeing who it allegedly was.\n\n\"It's definitely come out of Becky's account. I think she did it. Sadly I really do. It's a shame as she probably didn't think she was going to get caught out.\"\n\nColeen took to Twitter yesterday to accuse Rebeka of lifting posts from her private Instagram account and selling them to the press.\n\nThe stories contained fake things that had happened to Coleen, including choosing her next baby's gender, a flooding in her house and a return to TV, which were all made into articles.\n\nWayne Rooney's wife knew then exactly where they had come from, and took to Twitter to accuse her selling stories.\n\nColeen wrote: \"For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing the sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\"There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\"\n\nColeen then revealed the details of her plan to expose the perpretator.\n\nShe explained: \"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It\u2019s......... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"", "description": "The model, who is married to Jamie Vardy, said Danielle was talking \"b*****ks\" when she accused her of being a liar", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Twitter", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543964.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_TRIC-Awards-VIP-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
