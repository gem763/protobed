Nor, he said, would he tolerate \u201cdithering\u201d by an Obama administration State Department that he called \u201cdeeply obstructive of getting the American people the facts that they needed.\u201d\n\nNow, as secretary of state, Pompeo is facing a political crisis that directly challenges his leadership of the department he once excoriated. He is accused by House Democrats of blocking their impeachment inquiry by resisting the release of information to Congress that may shed light on the Trump administration\u2019s shadow foreign policy with Ukraine.\n\nAnd career diplomats, some of whom blame the Trump administration for dismembering the Foreign Service and undercutting U.S. diplomacy, are expected to be among the first witnesses telling their stories to Congress during its inquiry.\n\n\u201cIn many ways this seems to be a situation where he\u2019s reaping what he sowed,\u201d said Derek Chollet, the executive vice president of the German Marshall Fund, who served in both the State and Defense departments under President Barack Obama.\n\nDuring the Benghazi hearings in 2016, Pompeo bombarded Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with questions about whether the State Department had failed to put adequate security on the ground, leading to the death of a U.S. ambassador. Now Pompeo is being asked whether his State Department was part of an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe details are different, but lawmakers in both cases accused the State Department of obstruction and not supporting its diplomats.\n\nWith the tables turned, the House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected Thursday to query Kurt D. Volker, a longtime diplomat, former ambassador to NATO and, until last week, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine.\n\nVolker is the man who put Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in touch with the new government in Kyiv, though he appeared to have deep reservations about how Ukraine policy was veering off course. His testimony is expected to be followed over the coming days by Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled early as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and dismissed by Trump as \u201cbad news,\u201d someone he promised would \u201cgo through some things.\u201d\n\nBoth will be asked whether they had evidence that Trump or his representatives were dangling U.S. support \u2014 and suspending congressionally approved military assistance \u2014 to get political dirt from the Ukrainian government to undercut Biden\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nPompeo has often said that the Trump administration has not been tested by a true foreign crisis \u2014 and that sooner or later one was coming. Now he is caught in the middle of a domestic one. He will be pressed to explain what he knew \u2014 after acknowledging that he listened in on a July 25 phone call between Trump and the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2014 and how he reacted when he heard his boss seek political help.\n\n\u201cI was on the phone call,\u201d he said Wednesday, but ignored a question about what he thought about Trump\u2019s requests.\n\nThat admission was a marked change. In interviews in recent weeks, Pompeo repeatedly evaded questions about the content of the call between the two presidents, and never volunteered that he had listened in.\n\nIn an interview Sept. 22, days before the White House released a transcript of the call, Pompeo suggested that he was unaware of the details, telling Martha Raddatz of ABC that he had not seen the whistleblower report and then describing U.S. policy toward Ukraine in traditional terms, without reference to the favors Trump sought.\n\nThe Benghazi hearings that first brought national attention to Pompeo, then a conservative congressman from Kansas, investigated systematic security failings after four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in an attack on a diplomatic outpost and a nearby CIA annex in 2012. The two-year congressional inquiry \u2014 one of the most bitterly partisan in history \u2014 concluded that the State Department and the CIA did not appreciate the high security risk in Benghazi, but found no evidence that Clinton was directly to blame.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- As a member of Congress, Mike Pompeo drove the Republican inquiry into the killing of a U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya, and made clear there was no place for politics in American diplomacy.
