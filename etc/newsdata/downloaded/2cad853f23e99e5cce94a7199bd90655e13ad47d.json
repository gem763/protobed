But he will not answer them, so she must.\n\nAnd this really is the thing. We are all Arcuri. Whoever goes near Johnson, in whatever capacity, appears to ultimately find that it ends in some form of misery or shame. Wives, lovers, political allies and personal friends all find the same. At the moment, it is Arcuri\u2019s turn to suffer. In the coming months and years, it will simply be Britain\u2019s. It will be all of ours.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It is his. But nevertheless, it was not.\n\nThere is a reason many public relations professionals get extremely rich just for training politicians, sportspeople and company executives to say \u201cno comment\u201d rather than \u201cno\u201d to even the most preposterous question. The moment you deny something, anything at all, it casts doubt over every other occasion on which you have declined to comment.\n\nAt least six times, Arcuri called all suggestions that Johnson had ever done her or her company a single favour \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d. When asked, at least as many times, whether she really had any right to the public money she had received, or to be on trade delegations that she wasn\u2019t qualified for, she was righteous and somewhat indignant in her response.\n\nBut she was also offered at least 10 opportunities to say if her relationship with Johnson was an intimate one \u2013 an entirely legitimate question, that is entirely in the public interest. She politely declined them all.\n\nShe is, self-evidently, a highly tenacious person. She bumped into Johnson at a boring industry event, befriended him and allegedly talked him into doing his unpaid bit to boost her business.\n\nEven in the eye of this particular storm, she may even still be of the view that her friendship with Johnson was all worth it.\n\nIt is not her impropriety. It is his. Her role is the same as all those that have gone before. To carry the can for him, to bear the burden of his actions.\n\nIt will be all of ours next.", "description": "If there turns out to have been impropriety at the heart of the Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri story, it should be made absolutely clear that it will be his \u2013\u00a0not her\u2019s.
