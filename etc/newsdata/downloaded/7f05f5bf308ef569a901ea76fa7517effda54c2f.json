Kitack Lim, secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization says ports, shipping lines and fuel providers \u201care all set to go\u201d to meet the mandate starting Jan. 1 to slash sulfur emissions from their vessels. Mr. Lim tells the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Costas Paris, \u201cCompliant fuel will be available and it\u2019s working very well in trial voyages.\u201d Some ship owners remain wary of the impact of the new rules, and many say the sulfur rule and impending new limits for greenhouse-gas emissions will raise costs for shippers and consumers. Ocean transport makes up a small portion of overall supply-chain costs however, and one new report says the entire decarbonization process across the maritime industry would likely add less than 1% to the cost of a $60 pair of jeans.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nTrucking industry officials are raising alarms over legislation in California that takes aim at \u201cgig-economy\u201d business models beyond big technology players. Industry groups say the measure that passed the state\u2019s legislature this week would upend road transport business across California, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, including the port-trucking operations that are a big part of the state\u2019s goods-movement economy. Under the bill, certain industries would have to meet tough standards to classify a worker as a contractor instead of an employee. Businesses are still trying to figure out the impact on often-complicated relationships between owner-operator drivers, trucking companies and freight brokers.Trucking officials say taking on independent drivers as employees would likely prove costly for companies, and make operations less nimble. Other businesses far from technology are also weighing the impact, including construction, translators and agriculture.\n\nCompetition in Japan\u2019s e-commerce industry is heating up. Yahoo Japan Corp. will spend $3.7 billion to take a controlling stake in Japanese online fashion retailer Zozo Inc., the WSJ\u2019s Megumi Fujikawa reports, providing a platform to help transform its business from news content into digital retail. Once a corporate cousin of the U.S. Yahoo website, Yahoo Japan is now a separate company under SoftBank Group Corp. aiming to take on heavyweights Amazon.com Inc. and homegrown rival Rakuten Inc. With Zozo in its stable, Yahoo Japan hopes to attract younger fashion-conscious consumers in a Japanese e-commerce market that reached $167 billion in sales last year. The move suggests the e-commerce playing field is still forming, even in seemingly developed markets like Japan. Package delivery in Japan is expensive and analysts expect the agreement will help both Yahoo Japan and Zozo get more efficient in logistics.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201c \u201cIf shipping companies take on all the cost, they will collapse.\u201d \u201d \u2014The International Maritime Organization\u2019s Kitack Lim, on environmental mandates.\n\nNumber of the Day 139.0 The U.S. Freight Transportation Services Index in July, a 0.9% increase from June and a record high for the measure, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nThe European Central Bank launched a sweeping stimulus package that includes lower interest rates a broad package of bond purchases.
