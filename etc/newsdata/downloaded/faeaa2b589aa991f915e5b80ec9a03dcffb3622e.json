Give it to him, already.", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post President Trump outside the White House on Monday.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nI get my felonies mixed up. Was President Trump committing bribery if he offered the Ukrainian president $250 million in foreign aid in exchange for an investigation to smear potential Democratic nominee Joe Biden? Or would that be considered extortion?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. The real question is whether now, finally, the House of Representatives will perform its constitutional duty to hold Trump accountable. At this point, the president is practically begging for impeachment. Give it to him, already.\n\nLook, this is not a close call. According to published reports about a whistleblower complaint \u2014 which the administration outrageously refuses to share with Congress \u2014 Trump, during a July phone call, badgered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to investigate Biden. Trump also withheld the military aid funds that Ukraine desperately needs.\n\nWithout a transcript of the call, it is impossible to know whether the proffer of a quid pro quo \u2014 I\u2019ll release the aid if you throw mud on my potential election rival \u2014 was explicit or merely implied. But it\u2019s clearly there, and it\u2019s the kind of message federal agents are accustomed to overhearing in the wiretapped conversations of organized crime bosses: You play ball with me, I\u2019ll play ball with you, we both get what we want, and nobody has to get hurt.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, what more do you need to launch an official impeachment probe? I mean a real one, not the \u201csorta, kinda, maybe\u201d investigation you\u2019ve permitted thus far. It would be an outrageous abuse of power, clearly worthy of impeachment, for the president to use his office against a political opponent in this brazen manner.\n\nThat\u2019s bad enough in itself. But the incident involved seeking help from a foreign leader to gain advantage in a U.S. presidential election. I repeat: a foreign leader. Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III spent two years investigating whether Trump actively sought \u2014 or merely benefited from \u2014 such aid by Russia during the 2016 election. Now, allegedly, Trump is looking to Ukraine for election meddling in 2020.\n\nStill not enough? Consider that the target of the hit job that Trump apparently tried to arrange is a former vice president who has dedicated his whole adult life to public service. That means nothing at all to Trump, I\u2019m sure. But does it also mean nothing at all to members of Congress? Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?\n\nAlso impeachable is the administration\u2019s refusal to follow the law and disclose the whistleblower\u2019s full complaint to Congress. Ironically \u2014 and perhaps sadly, at this point \u2014 this last offense is what Pelosi cited, in a letter to members of Congress released Sunday, as a potential last straw.\n\n\u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthey will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cwhole new stage,\u201d one assumes, Pelosi must mean impeachment. But she did not use that word, so maybe she\u2019s still looking for some excuse not to act.\n\nTrump\u2019s numerous acts of obstruction of justice are painstakingly detailed in the Mueller report. The president\u2019s egregious abuses of power and his self-enriching corruption are clear for all to see. He has shown a cavalier willingness to simply ignore laws and court orders he finds inconvenient. His stonewalling of congressional committees mocks the foundational principle of separation of powers. The case for impeachment passed its tipping point long ago.\n\nBiden said Saturday that \u201cTrump\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum, and he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s fear is palpable. The fact that he would risk trying to muscle a foreign leader into ginning up a \u201cscandal\u201d to hang around Biden\u2019s neck shows how desperately worried he is about losing the election. Now that this outrage is coming to light, Trump\u2019s mouthpieces \u2014 led by his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and amplified by Fox News \u2014 will try to frame the debate as if a scandal had in fact been uncovered. None has been.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection strategy is apparently to replace the innuendo of \u201cHillary\u2019s emails\u201d with the smarm of \u201cBiden and Ukraine.\u201d He should be forced to throw his mud from the dock of an impeachment trial.\n\neugenerobinson@washpost.com\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nEugene Robinson: House Democrats can\u2019t have it both ways\n\nJennifer Rubin: We\u2019re taking baby steps toward an accurate impeachment debate\n\nGreg Sargent: It\u2019s time, Speaker Pelosi\n\nJames Downie: Begin impeachment hearings now\n\nGeorge T.
