It is special however when all of those appear in a thread of odd proportions over nothing consequential.\n\nIt all begins with a video. One account shot a video of their boyfriend driving past a convoy of Jeeps driving to some event. The boyfriend is going off on a prim rant about the vehicles.\n\nplease watch this video of my boyfriend complaining about jeeps pic.twitter.com/FlMJsKdilI \u2014 Scary Mary \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@fiercedevlin) October 10, 2019\n\nAfter a couple of days Twitter got wind of this posting. It led to a number of people commenting about the nature of the driver.\n\nI say this with all the love and compassion in my heart: Your boyfriend is a 13 year old boy who thinks he's clever and edgy because he's cursing every third word, and he's doing this all in a grandpa sweater from the 80's. This is some seriously impotent ranting. \u2014 Joanne Mason (@JoanneMason11) October 14, 2019\n\nPoor little fella. Probably gets mad at Clydesdale horses cause they are bigger than his my little ponies collections \u2014 stay positive (@JandEsdad) October 13, 2019\n\nPlease tell me he is driving a Prius pic.twitter.com/2SP0Uh5yi2 \u2014 trashbag (@guccitrashbags) October 12, 2019\n\nI want to go by a third Jeep watching this pants wetting tantrum. Grow up Skippy #0IIIIIII0 \u2014 DaveMedia_LNK (@DaveMedia_LNK) October 14, 2019\n\nAsk him if stereotyping is wrong. \u2014 Brad Pade (@BradPade) October 13, 2019\n\nAnd on it went. What was telling though is that in the raft of replies none were of a direct political stance. Yet, as we have become all too familiar with by now, everything has to revert back to the White House, because as your boyfriend gets into a snit over cars driving by, and people note the curious nature of someone doing this, it ALL has to be the fault of one man.\n\nhey uh im really mad that that jeep tweet has caught on with conservative twitter like can ppl stop telling me to leave my boyfriend just because he doesn\u2019t like jeeps \ud83d\ude41 \u2014 Scary Mary \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@fiercedevlin) October 13, 2019\n\nAw thank you this really made me feel better! Unfortunately it looks like Trump twitter got a hold of it :/ \u2014 Scary Mary \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@fiercedevlin) October 13, 2019\n\nSure, people mocking someone upset at a lineup of vehicles MUST be a sign of \u201cconservative Twitter\u201d. Even further afield, how this has anything to do with Trump is inexplicable. But then again, this is someone who begged people to watch the posted video of her boyfriend complaining about Jeeps, now getting upset that people watched the video of her boyfriend complaining about Jeeps.\n\nThen if things are not obtuse enough, there was one other person who weighed in.\n\nYour boyfriend is an ass who doesn't know WTF he's talking about. And from his douchey hipster hair & beard & the most boring clothes imaginable, I'd say he's the one utterly lacking in personality. Oh, FYI, a gathering of Jeeps like that only happens when they're going offroad. pic.twitter.com/hf8L6a91SP \u2014 Thunder Levin (@ThunderLevin) October 13, 2019\n\nThat is the infamous Asylum Studios screenwriter, by the way. Because this has not become completely off the rails enough. It did not escape notice.\n\nwhy am i now in twitter beef with the writer of sharknado 1-4 \u2014 Scary Mary \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@fiercedevlin) October 13, 2019\n\nBecause this is Twitter, and life in 2019 is a surreal fever-dream.
