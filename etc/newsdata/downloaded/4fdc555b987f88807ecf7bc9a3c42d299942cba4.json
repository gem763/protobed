Her story became her restaurant.", "language": "en", "text": "The story of Batata Doce began more than five decades ago in Angola, during the Portuguese Colonial War in Africa. In 1965, Portuguese soldiers fighting southeast of Luanda saw a woman running away from them across a swamp, holding a small child by the hand and carrying another on her back. Suddenly, the child on the woman\u2019s back slipped off. Terrified of the men, the woman continued to run as far as she could, leaving the child that fell behind.\n\n\n\nIsabel Jacinto pauses for a moment at her restaurant. (Tiago Maya for The Washington Post)\n\nThe soldiers decided to take the child in and nicknamed her Batata Doce, or \u201csweet potato.\u201d They cared for her and loved her, for she brought innocence to their lives interrupted by war. When an Angolan fighter of the MPLA (People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola) was captured, he recognized the child as his niece. He explained that the girl\u2019s father was a soldier who died in combat. When the Portuguese soldiers left Angola, the uncle gave his permission for the girl to go along with them, believing she would have a better life away from the war.\n\nIn 2019, \u201cBatata Doce\u201d is more than a child\u2019s nickname. It\u2019s a popular restaurant in Lisbon helmed by chef Isabel Jacinto \u2014 the very woman who was brought to Portugal by the soldiers for a new life.\n\nBatata Doce, which feels like a Parisian bistro bar and on the surface looks nothing like an African restaurant, has a full house every night. It\u2019s popular among Portuguese people, tourists and the diplomatic staff who work near the place, in Lisbon\u2019s diplomatic quarter of Estrela. Since Jacinto\u2019s story became famous in Portugal, the restaurant has also become popular among the African community. Jacinto is especially excited when she talks about their reviews.\n\n\n\nTwo French embassy employees have lunch at the Batata Doce. (Tiago Maya for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMany Angolans that come here say this is the best Angolan restaurant they have ever tried,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Jacinto was not always privy to the African cooking that makes up one half of the Portuguese-African fusion her restaurant is known for now. Jacinto\u2019s friends always considered her a good cook of Portuguese cuisine, but they couldn\u2019t look past the fact that their Angolan-born friend didn\u2019t know how to make a single African dish.\n\nYears ago, they decided to teach her how to make muamba chicken, an Angolan stew, and moqueca, a fish stew from the Bahia state of Brazil born among enslaved Africans. Jacinto used to feel somewhat distant from those flavors, but eventually, she added the recipes to her repertoire. She started a catering company that showcased her new signature style, and then eventually grew the business into the restaurant named after her extraordinary story.\n\nJacinto says she only began thinking about her past and her roots after becoming a mother. She knew she had been born in Angola and had been separated from her family in remarkable circumstances. But Jacinto saw it as an anecdote \u2060 \u2014 a very distant tale\u2060 \u2014 because she grew up happy in Portugal and felt Portuguese.\n\n\u201cI always saw Portugal as home. The family in which I was raised made no difference between me and their three biological children,\u201d she says. \u201cThey only told me I had been found in the bushes, and I didn\u2019t make much out of it \u2014 I thought it was a funny story.\u201d\n\n\n\nJacinto keeps the photos of her with the family of the commander Manoel Junqueira. (Tiago Maya for The Washington Post)\n\nJacinto married a Portuguese man and had two children. It wasn\u2019t until her own children began to show a curiosity in their Angolan heritage that her own interest was piqued. Her daughter admired the tight, united culture of Angolan families she\u2019d studied, and it struck a chord with Jacinto.\n\n\u201cI used to tell my daughter I missed the warmth of having a family of my own,\u201d she says.\n\nBut then in 2016, a connection to that very family emerged. Roberto Paulo, the son-in-law of one of Jacinto\u2019s sisters, set out on a mission to find her in Portugal. He was told to search the name \u201cBatata Doce\u201d by Jacinto\u2019s uncle, who knew the name was associated with Isabel from his time under Portuguese arrest. As fate would have it, a search on Facebook led Paulo to Jacinto\u2019s restaurant. The two had lunch that day.\n\n\n\nJacinto greets an old friend. (Tiago Maya for The Washington Post)\n\nA little more than a year after that encounter, Jacinto went to Angola along with a team of reporters. For a week, Jacinto met her sisters and learned that an aunt \u2014 not her mother, as she\u2019d previously believed \u2014 had dropped her accidentally.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked into her eyes, I saw how much she suffered for 50 years, being accused of losing me,\u201d the chef says.\n\nShe says she has no resentment. But she\u2019s upset with herself she only stayed in her birth country for a week.\n\n\u201cMany things remain a mystery to me,\u201d she says, still intrigued.\n\nPart of her restlessness also comes from the emotional hurricane the trip unleashed.\n\n\u201cI landed in Angola and could tell immediately I belonged there. I could feel it in my blood, how happy I had been there, which was something I didn\u2019t anticipate,\u201d Jacinto says, acknowledging she has even considered moving to Angola, having later decided she at least wants her ashes to rest there after she dies.\n\n\n\nJacinto chooses ingredients at her local market Mercado da Ribeira. (Tiago Maya for The Washington Post)\n\nBut along with the emotions the trip released, it also brought Jacinto new culinary inspiration.\n\n\u201cI cooked with my family in Angola, and they\u2019re much better cooks than I am. I returned home with 15 extra pounds of food in my suitcase,\u201d says Jacinto, who believes she now feels closer to the African food she already used to cook.\n\nRead more:\n\nA local\u2019s guide to Liston, Portugal\n\nA Lisbon restaurant\u2019s No. 1 dish reflects its owner\u2019s extraordinary life\n\nThe \u2018king of carbonara\u2019 shows us how he makes his signature dish", "description": "Chef Isabel Jacinto was rescued from wartime as a child.
