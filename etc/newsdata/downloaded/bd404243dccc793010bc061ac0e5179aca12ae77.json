However, they\u2019ve discussed a payment as low as $2 billion in private talks with the investment bank, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMalaysian authorities are considering accepting $2 billion to $3 billion from Goldman, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The bank raked in $600 million for helping 1MDB, Malaysia\u2019s state investment fund, raise $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013, Bloomberg said.\n\n1MDB bought privately owned power plants and planned to create a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur. However, it racked up $12 billion in debt instead of financing its initiatives through foreign investment, and most of the money it raised was allegedly embezzled or laundered.\n\nThe US Justice Department alleges more than $4.5 billion was funneled through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials, instead of being spent on public infrastructure projects, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal is a bizarre story with links to President Donald Trump, former Victoria\u2019s Secret model Miranda Kerr, and even \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d For more details on the full story click here.\n\nThe Malaysian government is pressuring Goldman to pay. It filed criminal charges against the bank last December, seeking more than $2.7 billion in fines and charges. It has charged 17 of its former and current executives including Alibaba president Michael Evans.\n\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment. The bank has previously described charges against it as \u201cmisdirected\u201d and said the targeted entities would be \u201cvigorously defended.\u201d\n\nMalaysia might be open to settling for less than a third of its public target, but prosecutors are also ramping up efforts to have the criminal case heard in the country\u2019s high court, Bloomberg reported. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, wants to make progress before the year ends as he\u2019s pledged to restore the money allegedly siphoned from the country\u2019s coffers, the news outlet added.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Malaysian prosecutors would drop charges against Goldman and its bankers if a deal is reached, Bloomberg reported.", "description": "Business Insider - Officials have publicly demanded $7.5 billion from the bank for helping the state investment fund to raise $6.5 billion, most of which went missing..
