The U.S. SPR, held in underground storage caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts, currently contains nearly 645 million barrels, or about the amount the United States consumes in a month.\n\nThe United States has another 416.1 million barrels sitting in commercial storage, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s most recent data. Those are held by oil producers, refiners and traders.\n\nSaudi Arabia has said it would use oil in storage to fill tankers for customers. The country has about 188 million barrels in reserve, according to a note on Saturday from Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nThe International Energy Agency, which coordinates the energy policies of industrialized nations, said on Saturday that it was in contact with major producing and consuming countries but that oil markets were well supplied.The IEA has previously coordinated releases of crude and fuel from stockpiles when supply was disrupted.\n\nThe IEA advises member countries to keep the equivalent of at least 90 days of net oil imports in strategic storage.\n\nTop oil importer China is the biggest importer of Saudi Arabian crude. China also has large strategic reserves, but last released figures on the size in April 2017.\n\nRobert Ryan, chief commodity and energy strategist at Montreal-based BCA Research, estimated China\u2019s SPR at 510 million barrels while Seng Yick Tee, an analyst at SIA Energy estimated that China currently holds 325 million barrels of SPR.\n\nRyan said it was a matter of time before governments would run through their commercial stockpiles, and be required to tap emergency reserves.\n\n\u201cThe market could tighten significantly if the outage is indeed weeks and not days. You will see SPR draws. Arguably the world is dependent on strategic reserves right now,\u201d he said.", "description": "Governments worldwide may need to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's move to tap emergency oil stockpiles if top exporter Saudi Arabia is unable to quickly repair the damage inflicted by attacks on its energy industry on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
