Jordan", "language": "en", "text": "Naomi Osaka jokingly confronted Ellen DeGeneres for something the talk show host did last year: text Osaka\u2019s celebrity crush, Michael B. Jordan.\n\nOn her show Friday, DeGeneres applauded the tennis star for being honest and transparent in interviews.\n\n\u201cI like just being straightforward and honest, so yeah that usually gets me in a lot of trouble, like with you,\u201d Osaka responded with a laugh.\n\nWhen asked to explain, she said, \u201cBecause last time I was here, you just did me dirty.\u201d\n\nDuring Osaka\u2019s first visit to \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in September of last year, DeGeneres attempted to play matchmaker after the 21-year-old revealed that Jordan was her celebrity crush. The comedian texted the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d star a selfie that she had taken with Osaka during the segment.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what he says,\u201d DeGeneres said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stressing me out,\u201d Osaka replied. \u201cI\u2019m too young to be stressed out like this.\u201d\n\nThe following month, DeGeneres continued her efforts to connect the pair by tweeting a shirtless photo of Jordan in honor of Osaka\u2019s birthday.\n\nJordan responded with birthday greetings and an invitation for Osaka to attend the premiere of \u201cCreed II.\u201d\n\nThis one is better and more recent.

Thanks for the bday wishes, If you\u2019re serious I would totally want to go,\u201d Osaka tweeted back.\n\nDeGeneres defended her actions during Friday\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cAll I did was try to fulfill a fantasy of yours,\u201d DeGeneres said. She later asked Osaka why she ultimately didn\u2019t attend the premiere.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never gonna get a man,\u201d the host joked, before adding, \u201cLet me tell you how to get a man.\u201d\n\nBut Osaka may not need matchmaking help. The tennis champion has been romantically linked to rapper YBN Cordae. On Thursday, she posted a photo of the pair with a sweet caption.\n\n\u201cVery grateful you\u2019re in my life, always learning from you, always inspired by you,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAlso, always VERY entertained by you lol. Love ya kid.\u201d\n\nOsaka, who lost to Belinda Bencic in this year\u2019s U.S. Open en route to trying to defend her first Grand Slam title, shared a heartwarming moment with 15-year-old Coco Gauff earlier in the tournament.\n\nOsaka embraced Gauff after defeating her in the third round and asked the teen to join her post-match interview.
