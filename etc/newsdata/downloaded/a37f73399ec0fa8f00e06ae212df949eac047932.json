Just Please Use the Nap Room.", "language": "en", "text": "TOKYO\u2014 Mitsubishi Estate Co. Chief Executive Junichi Yoshida has heard his company\u2019s new nap rooms are supposed to help employees feel recharged. Not that he would know.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the nap rooms but never used them,\u201d he says. When he needs a rest, he does it in the traditional fashion\u2014nodding off in his chair.\n\nCompanies in Japan, the developed world\u2019s most sleep-deprived nation by one measure, are beginning to set aside spaces designated for employees to sleep on the job.\n\nJapanese workers, with eyes wide open, are refusing to take the down-filled bait.\n\nThe culture of sleeping has subtleties the office designers didn\u2019t dream of. Japanese would rather snooze at their desks, on park benches, in coffee shops\u2014any place other than the official locations set aside for the purpose.\n\nMitsubishi Estate owns some of Tokyo\u2019s priciest office space and wants to promote its properties as hubs for innovation. At headquarters, human-resources manager Go Negami spearheaded the installation of six rooms featuring recliners, mood lights and pamphlets on efficient napping. He advertised the initiative among its 850-some employees and unveiled an online nap-scheduling calendar.\n\nBusiness has been sleepy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve seen the nap rooms but never used them,\u2019 says Mitsubishi Estate\u2019s CEO of rooms such as this at headquarters. Photo: Mitsubishi Estate Co.\n\nSome people \u201cprobably thought, \u2018Why waste time napping?\u2019 \u201d says Mr. Negami. \u201cEven I felt the pressure to justify going for a nap.\u201d He naps in the designated rooms, hoping to lead by example.\n\nMr. Negami\u2019s superior, Bunroku Naganuma, says he has used the rooms but prefers sleeping at his desk: \u201cSeems like most people in Japan nap that way.\u201d\n\nAt the offices of Bitflyer Blockchain Inc., Japan\u2019s largest digital-currency exchange, CEO Yuzo Kano says he installed, then uninstalled, a room with a bunk bed. Of his 250 employees, he says, maybe only three used it to take naps.\n\nHe also tossed aside an idea of a beanbag for employees to relax in while playing videogames, a feature of the company\u2019s San Francisco office. Workers, he says, would be too embarrassed to play in front of colleagues.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that Japan has a taboo against public sleeping, as a typical late-night train shows. What stigmatizes the nap room, say workers, is the premeditated nature of the napping.\n\nNodding off at one\u2019s desk is admirable or at least pardonable, because it highlights one\u2019s hard work and grueling hours. Making a nap-room reservation looks like slacking off.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you nap at work? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cWorking long hours without a break and everyone working together until the end of the day, this is traditionally how Japan has done things,\u201d says Reina Hyakuya, a manager at Nextbeat Co., a Tokyo recruitment-consulting firm.\n\nShe says that she uses napping chairs in Nextbeat\u2019s lounge floor but rarely ventures into its nap rooms, which are dark, equipped with aroma diffusers and white-noise machines\u2014and require a reservation.\n\nBrigitte Steger, a University of Cambridge lecturer who has studied Japanese sleeping habits, distinguishes between a nap and what Japanese call inemuri, or roughly \u201cnodding off.\u201d The Japanese characters for the word more literally translate as \u201csleeping while present.\u201d\n\n\u201cInemuri is very different\u201d from a nap, says Dr. Steger. \u201cIt\u2019s not taking off your shoes and withdrawing, it\u2019s actually, \u2018I am actually at work.\u2019 You are still officially working even if you drop off.\u201d\n\nDr. Seiji Nishino, who runs Stanford University\u2019s Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine, says Americans tend to view the outcome of their work as important, whereas Japanese are more focused on the process, including \u201chow they are seen working hard.\u201d\n\nBeing seen in a designated nap room would be a waking nightmare.\n\nAt the Nescaf\u00e9 Sleeping Cafe in Tokyo, customers can drink coffee, then doze off to the sound of flowing water.

He endures suspicious glances from Japanese colleagues, he says. \u201cYou can feel some of the people on the Japanese side are judging us.\u201d\n\nThe average person in Japan sleeps 6 hours and 15 minutes at night, an hour less than in the U.S. and Switzerland, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which puts Japan at the bottom of its list of developed countries. In Mr. Lapouille\u2019s native France, it\u2019s 7\u00bd hours.\n\nJapanese colleagues \u201cleave later, work harder and don\u2019t nap,\u201d Mr. Lapouille says. \u201cOnce you realize you can\u2019t work as hard as them, it makes it easy to nap.\u201d\n\nTakanori Kobayashi, CEO of Tokyo startup NeuroSpace Co., which develops programs to improve sleep quality for corporate employees, has been trying to bring the power nap to Japanese corporations. He says a nap\u2014the real kind, lying back 20 to 30 minutes in the dark\u2014improves focus and productivity. Companies have been open, but pushback has come from employees: \u201cThere is this culture, you respect someone who doesn\u2019t sleep much.\u201d\n\nBedding maker Nishikawa Co. created a line of pillows for snoozing at the desk, designed to avoid facial sleep marks. Some have a face hole to prevent smudged makeup.\n\n\u201cIf you take a nap at your desk, your arms and hands may directly touch your face, leaving marks and causing your hands and arms to fall asleep,\u201d says spokeswoman Kazue Kasuga, adding that the office-snoozing pillows are outselling the company\u2019s home-snoozing lineup.\n\nAn image from Seiji Nishino's book on how to sleep better, \u2018The Stanford Method for Ultimate Sound Sleep.\u2019 Photo: Sunmark Publishing\n\nNestl\u00e9 SA unit Nestl\u00e9 Japan in March opened a \u201cNescaf\u00e9 Sleeping Cafe\u201d in Tokyo, where customers drink coffee and doze in a dark room to flowing-water sounds. The caffeine takes half an hour or so to kick in, and the idea is to get a power nap and wake up ready to go. Staff say business is good and the most frequent customers are workers who pop in for a quick rest away from the office.\n\nTokyo internet-services company GMO Internet Inc. decided to foster nonjudgmental work-napping by setting a company nap period starting after lunch and inviting all employees to do it together. It created a communal nap space with 27 cots.\n\nAt its busiest, says spokeswoman Sae Takahashi, about 80% of the cots are occupied. \u201cThe ease of going to the napping room\u2014the hurdle employees have to overcome to make it there\u2014is probably lower for a communal nap space,\u201d she says.\n\nWrite to Suryatapa Bhattacharya at Suryatapa.Bhattacharya@wsj.com", "description": "Some companies in Japan are creating spaces to snooze officially, but workers say the premeditated nature of using them smacks of sloth\u2014unlike dozing admirably in one\u2019s chair.", "authors": ["Suryatapa Bhattacharya", "River Davis", "Suryatapa.Bhattacharya Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108332/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
