The console will be available in just over a year, during the holiday season in 2020. Hopefully now that Sony has a deadline, we\u2019ll start to see more of what the console actually looks like.\n\nSony revealed this news itself ahead of a Wired spread detailing more about the console. In addition to the release date, we also know more about the controller, and the kind of internal updates we can expect. While Sony won\u2019t confirm the console looks like this V-shaped spaceship-looking thing we saw earlier this year, it hasn\u2019t denied it either.\n\nThe biggest hardware revelation is probably the new haptic controller. Sony claims to be replacing the \u201crumble\u201d that\u2019s become de rigueur as a form of feedback with something more nuanced. Peter Rubin of Wired corroborated this, having played a demo that required a character to walk over different surfaces: \u201cSand felt slow and sloggy; mud felt slow and soggy. On ice, a high-frequency response made the thumbsticks really feel like my character was gliding. Jumping into a pool, I got a sense of the resistance of the water; on a wooden bridge, a bouncy sensation.\u201d\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment President Jim Ryan also said the controllers will have \u201cadaptive triggers.\u201d This apparently means devs can program the triggers to offer resistance depending on what they\u2019re being used for: \u201c\u2026you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain.\u201d\n\nWe also know the PS5 will allow you to install only parts of a game that you want to play. Mark Cerny, PlayStation system architect, told Wired that game installation is configurable. If, for example, you only want to play a game\u2019s single-player campaign, you only have to install that information. This will be helped by an updated user interface \u2014 overdue, if you ask me, given how it feels the UI hasn\u2019t changed significantly in the last decade. While Cerny\u2019s description makes the new menu a little hard to picture, the proposed idea of being able to jump into a game wherever you please, without having to load and load and load is an attractive one:\n\nEven though it will be fairly fast to boot games, we don\u2019t want the player to have to boot the game, see what\u2019s up, boot the game, see what\u2019s up. Multiplayer game servers will provide the console with the set of joinable activities in real time. Single-player games will provide information like what missions you could do and what rewards you might receive for completing them\u2014and all of those choices will be visible in the UI. As a player you just jump right into whatever you like.\n\nThe one problem is that we\u2019re still not getting much news about what kinds of games the PS5 will ship with. Most upcoming games we know of are still in that current-gen limbo, and I have the feeling most games will be offered on both PS4 and PS5 for a while. Whatever next-gen exclusives Sony might have in the works, if any, it\u2019s keeping them close to the vest.\n\nIf you want to read about Rubin\u2019s experience playing with the PS5, check it out here. We\u2019ll keep you updated on any further information on the new console.
