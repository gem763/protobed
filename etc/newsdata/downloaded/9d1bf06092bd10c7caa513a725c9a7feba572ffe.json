United squanders golden opportunity for home playoff game in 0-0 draw", "language": "en", "text": "Instead of hosting Toronto FC in the Eastern Conference\u2019s first round Oct. 19 or 20, United will visit BMO Field. Instead of capping a resurgent month with three points, D.C. took just one, despite ideal circumstances.\n\nAD\n\nThe sides finished tied for fourth place with 13-10-11 records, but Toronto boasted a better goal differential (plus-five vs. plus-four). In the regular season, the teams played to two ties: 0-0 in Ontario and 1-1 in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nAmericans abroad roundup: Christian Pulisic notches another assist for Chelsea\n\n\u201cWhen that final whistle blew,\u201d goalkeeper Bill Hamid said, \u201cthe frustration was there.\u201d\n\nThere was one notable triumph: United tied the league record for consecutive shutouts (five), stretching the team\u2019s unblemished run to 504 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an impressive feat, and one that I am proud of,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to celebrate it right now because of the disappointment we won\u2019t come back here and reward the fans.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because United was blanked for the second consecutive time and 11th overall, squandering 33 shots. (Only three were on goal and one hit the post.) Only Columbus, Cincinnati and Vancouver scored fewer than United\u2019s 42 goals this season.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. United severs ties with streaming partner FloSports\n\nThe outcome also effectively ended Wayne Rooney\u2019s Audi Field tenure before he returns to English soccer. Rooney missed Sunday\u2019s match with a yellow-card suspension, and should United beat Toronto, it would visit top-seeded New York City FC in the conference semifinals.\n\nAD\n\nAnother upset would result in hosting the Eastern final only if the No. 6 New York Red Bulls or No. 7 New England Revolution also advance that far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been tough to beat on the road,\u201d Olsen said of United\u2019s 6-6-5 away record, third best in MLS. \u201cHopefully, that continues. It\u2019s going to have to.\u201d\n\nEach side hit the post in the early stage: Ulises Segura\u2019s deflected effort caromed off the right upright and Roland Lamah\u2019s header slammed off the left.\n\nAD\n\nThe match took a seismic turn late in the half with two Cincinnati ejections and a D.C. disallowed goal. Two of the three decisions required the video assistant referee.\n\nIt began in a harmless spot in front of the team benches when Silver Spring native Joe Gyau caught Segura in the upper thigh with a high challenge, tearing his shorts and earning a red card from referee David Gantar.\n\nAD\n\nIn an ensuing scuffle, Lamah grabbed Felipe Martins by the throat \u2014 Gantar did not see it but video assistant Rosendo Mendoza did., and Lamah was shown red.\n\nOn the restart, Steve Birnbaum headed the ball to Segura for a close-range finish, but video showed the Costa Rican offside.\n\nAD\n\nA two-man advantage is unusual; a two-man advantage for more than half the match is almost unheard of. After intermission, United did not do much with it.\n\nEleven ineffective minutes passed before Olsen added someone with the capacity to unlock Cincinnati\u2019s bunkered resistance: long-lost playmaker Luciano Acosta. Olsen did not wait much longer to exhaust his substitutions, adding attack-minded defender Leonardo Jara and striker Ola Kamara.\n\nIn his longest stint in six weeks, Acosta injected energy and skill. He had three chances to crack the deadlock, but sent Paul Arriola\u2019s cross over the crossbar, had a header saved by Przemyslaw Tyton and whistled a 20-yarder over the crossbar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCincinnati (6-22-6) was more organized and composed with nine men than at full strength, though attacking was an afterthought. It sat back, compressing space from 30 yards and in.\n\nAt every chance, the visitors wasted time. United vented at both Gantar and the Cincinnati players for the delays.\n\n\u201cIt got a little bit ridiculous,\u201d Olsen said. Gantar \u201clet them get away with it. It wasn\u2019t a fun half to watch that, but we still have enough chances. That is not an excuse.\u201d\n\nSeven additional minutes were enough for threats by Russell Canouse, Joseph Mora and Acosta \u2014 but not a precious goal.\n\n\u201cIt sucks right now, but we\u2019re in the playoffs and everyone has a chance,\u201d Birnbaum said. \u201cGo up there [to Toronto] and get a result, and we\u2019re flying.\u201d\n\nNotes: U.S. national team Coach Gregg Berhalter was in attendance, one day before his squad will open training camp at George Mason University leading to the Nations League match against Cuba on Friday at Audi Field. Arriola was among 26 players named to the squad.\n\nAD", "description": "Needing a win to secure a home playoff game, D.C. is unable to find the back of the net despite a two-man advantage for more than a half against the MLS's worst side.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
