When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action.'\n\nThe stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust which was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.\n\nAn expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.\n\nMichael Ruck, Investigations Partner at the law firm TLT, said: 'The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.\n\n'If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.'\n\nMr Denning, who had worked at Capital Group for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.\n\nHis lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust: 'Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.'\n\nThey also say his error was to rely on the advice of a former professional advisor and that the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.", "description": "Mark Denning, 62, who owns a 9 bedroom house, called Morebath Manor, in Morebath, North Devon, was breaking rules by secretly buying shares for his own benefit through a secretive fund.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/19990116-0-image-a-44_1571661525429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
