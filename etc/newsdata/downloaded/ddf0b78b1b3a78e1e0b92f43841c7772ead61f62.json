The strike, led by 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg, is a protest against the continued use of fossil fuels and their role in the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time that Amazon workers at corporate offices are walking out, and it\u2019s the first walkout in the tech industry over the climate crisis,\u201d Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group made of Amazon employees who have organised the walkout, said in a press statement.\n\nBut what exactly are employees protesting? And what can we expect from Amazon? (Here\u2019s a spoiler: Not much.)\n\nWhat are they protesting?\n\nIn a statement, the group said they are protesting the company\u2019s \u201cintensive\u201d use of fossil fuels, contracts with fossil fuel companies that use the company\u2019s technology to facilitate oil and gas production, and history of funding American Congressmembers who have voted against climate legislation. (68 members in 2018, to be exact; Amazon was also a donor for a gala organised by an institute that dispels the \u201cmyths\u201d of climate change.)\n\nLast year, AECJ urged Amazon\u2019s board of directors and Jeff Bezos to adopt a climate plan resolution \u2014 undersigned by 8,215 employees \u2014 which included making public commitments to cut emissions and reduce pollution in communities impacted most by climate change. The resolution never passed.\n\nBack in July, an estimated 75 Amazon warehouse workers in Minnesota also went on a one-day strike on Amazon Prime Day, demanding better wages and safer working conditions; a similar strike took place in Germany. Amazon, for the most part, remained unaffected and a spokesperson said that protestors \u201cconjured misinformation\u201d in their favour.\n\nPhoto: Jeff Sullivan, Getty Images\n\nWhat are they demanding?\n\nAECJ\u2019s demands for Amazon are ambitious and include goals like:\n\nZero contracts with fossil fuel companies.\n\nZero funding for climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.\n\nZero emissions by 2030, including the incorporation of electric vehicles in communities most affected by climate change. \u201cA commitment from Amazon has the power to move industries. Investment by the company in electrified aviation or maritime shipping would be a game-changer,\u201d says AECJ.\n\nIn April, and despite commitments to sustainability, Gizmodo reported Amazon\u2019s Web Services have actively courted the fossil fuel industry, which fuelled AECJ\u2019s demand for zero contracts with such companies.\n\nHas Amazon responded?\n\nIn a statement to Wired, Amazon didn\u2019t directly address news of the walkout but used the opportunity to emphasise its sustainability initiatives. \u201cPlaying a significant role in helping to reduce the sources of human-induced climate change is an important commitment for Amazon,\u201d they told Wired. \u201cWe have dedicated sustainability teams who have been working for years on initiatives to reduce our environmental impact.\u201d\n\nAmazon has made efforts to combat its impact on the environment, including its adoption of \u201cfrustration-free\u201d packaging and the recent announcement of its \u201cShipment Zero\u201d project \u2014 a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon for half of all its shipments by 2030 through continued use of recyclable packaging, electric vehicles, and renewable energy.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s announcement in February, they will share Amazon\u2019s \u201ccompany-wide carbon footprint\u201d later this year; Amazon has not yet made these figures public.", "description": "On September 21, over 1,000 Amazon employees \u2014 mostly made up of staff at the company\u2019s Seattle headquarters \u2014 will walk out of Amazon offices to protest the company\u2019s inaction over climate change, as part of the larger global climate strike.
