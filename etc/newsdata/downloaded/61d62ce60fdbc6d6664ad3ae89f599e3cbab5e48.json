And this weekend, he is in Hong Kong for the Barclays Moontrekker, hoping to inspire others to push their limits.\n\nIn 2015, the 2011 Ultra Runner of the Year was training near Boulder, Colorado, when he stepped on a large rock. It dislodged, and both he and the rock fell. The rock landed on his leg and pinned him for hours. After he was rescued, Mackey went through multiple surgeries but almost a year and a half later he opted to have his leg amputated so he could get back to the trails.\n\nSince then, Mackey has completed the gruelling Leadman series twice. The series includes increasingly challenging runs and mountain bikes around Leadville, concluding with a 100 mile (161km) running race at altitude.\n\nGetting back out there may not have been possible, had he not acquired a wealth of experience in ultra running already.\n\n\u201cOver time you are used to pain,\u201d he said. \u201cYour emotional side, your body adapts to pain and discomfort. When I lost the leg, it was the same thing. I knew I could work through these little problems to get to the bigger goal. Once I finished the Leadman series two summers ago I knew it was because these incremental steps.\u201d\n\nMackey will help launch the Moontrekker race. The race starts in Mui Wo and heads across Lantau. Runners compete as solos, pairs or teams of four. There are three distances, 30km, 40km and 50km. Unfortunately, Mackey will not be running. He recently had another surgery when a piece of \u201chardware\u201d in his leg continued to cause discomfort as he finished his latest Leadville 100 mile race. It was \u201cfrustrating\u201d, but it is still a blessing to be out there.\n\n\u201cI always knew I'd get back, but I didn't know if I could do the Leadman series,\u201d he said. \u201cBut actually once I had the amputation I realised pretty much anything is possible. Anyone can do these events. Part of it had to do with the fact that I knew people out there were doing these events with one, or two amputation.\n\n\u201cI'm aware that people look at what I do and see it as inspiring, and I'm happy about that,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cI'm happy that I'm going through this and other people can learn from it. People tell me it all the time, especially during the races when they see me running with one leg. It gives me more energy to finish, and makes me accountable.\u201d\n\nHe added that he often failed too. He recently dropped out of the Western States 100 near the end. \u201cBut that happens to people, one or two legs, they drop for whatever reasons.\u201d\n\nMackey was invited to Moontrekker by The Nature Conservatory (TNC), an environmental charity linked to the event.\n\n\u201cHaving spent so much time in nature, just the preservation of aspects of the world as development encroaches everywhere [is important],\u201d Mackey said. \u201cFor individual actions, since I\u2019ve been involved in trail running, I\u2019ve seen lifestyle changes [to become more environmentally conscious, which is good].\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just the trails, but oceans, TNC preserves these worlds,\u201d he added.", "description": "The 2011 Ultra Runner of the Year suffered a fall in 2015 that cost him his leg, but has since completed the Leadman series twice", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/18/84599c58-f15a-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_142925.jpg?itok=AiPl0MZn&v=1571380170", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
