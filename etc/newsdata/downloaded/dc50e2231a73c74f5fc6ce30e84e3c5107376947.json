Pizarro, 16, died Sept. 4 at a Milwaukee medical clinic where his mother, Iraida M. Pizarro-Osorio, had taken him after he became unresponsive, according to a criminal complaint filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court.\n\nThe complaint said the teen appeared extremely emaciated and that his skeletal structure was visible underneath his skin.\n\nPizarro-Osorio told police her son had a chromosome disorder, was epileptic and autistic and that the condition impacted his ability to gain weight. She said he also had the mental capacity of a small child and never weighed more than 75 to 80 pounds (36.29 kilograms).\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She told them she had prior referrals to child protective services and was afraid of losing her son and her two other children.\n\nThe complaint notes the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s autopsy on the teen revealed multiple signs of severe malnutrition and that he weighed just 42 pounds. The cause of the boy\u2019s death is still pending, according to the medical examiner.\n\nPizarro-Osorio is charged with one count of chronic child neglect resulting in great bodily harm. Pizarro-Osorio\u2019s public defender, Reyna Morales, declined to comment on the case.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Hector J.
