Seeking foreign help in an election is illegal. Who would stand up and say so?\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Mitt Romney stepped in.\n\n\u201cBy all appearances, the president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nRomney\u2019s delayed criticism seemed to capture the senator\u2019s continued discomfort with the role of chief Trump critic, and a possible reluctance to restart the kind of back-and-forth that revved up on Saturday as Trump took to Twitter. The president unleashed a personal attack on Romney, calling him \u201cpompous,\u201d while defending his conversations with Ukraine and China as appropriate.\n\nFacing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, Trump raised the specter of impeachment against Romney in a Saturday afternoon tweet, though the Constitution doesn\u2019t call for that as a way of removing a member of Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake,\u201d Trump tweeted without citing his sources. \u201cI agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY\u201d.\n\nThe mild-mannered, failed-presidential-candidate-turned-senator has shown he feels compelled to speak out against Trump at key moments. But he doesn\u2019t appear quick to the draw. While Trump detractors are looking to Romney to play a key role in rallying GOP opposition to the president in the unfolding impeachment saga, it\u2019s far from clear Romney wants the job.\n\nRomney has left the door open further than most, said Reed Galen, a consultant who worked for Sen. John McCain, George W. Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger before leaving the GOP in 2016. But \u201cthere\u2019s a long way from opening a door and walking through it.\u201d\n\nThe 72-year-old senator is unusually well positioned to take on a president who remains broadly popular with Republican voters. His job security is all but guaranteed in conservative Utah, where he\u2019s a near celebrity. Many voters, particularly fellow members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, shared Romney\u2019s wariness about Trump.\n\nA nationwide Associated Press survey of midterm voters last year found that while two-thirds of church members voted Republican, just over half approved of Trump\u2019s job performance. The VoteCast survey also found that 64% of Utah voters wanted to see the senator confront the president.\n\nHis political brand, forged as a governor in Massachusetts, the savior of the troubled 2002 Olympics and a well-appointed representative of the corporate-friendly wing of GOP, has very little to do with Trump and the populist uprising.\n\nAll of that has some looking to Romney as a possible standard bearer. The anti-Trump conservative group Defending Democracy Together is running new ads in Utah encouraging him to speak out.\n\n\u201cI think Mitt Romney came back to the Senate for a reason, and I hope this is the reason,\u201d said Sarah Longwell, the group\u2019s executive director. As a former presidential nominee who built his career in part on this capacity for moral leadership, Romney has a role as a Republican elder statesman that few can match, she said. \u201cThis is going to be the moment where Mitt Romney will play, I think, the decisive role in what Republicans do going forward.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is so sure. While he lashed then-candidate Trump as a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d in a 2016 speech that didn\u2019t keep him from being elected, Romney also dined with Trump as he aimed to become secretary of state and accepted the president\u2019s endorsement during his Senate run two years later.\n\nWhile he resumed the charge with a Washington Post op-ed on the eve of his Senate swearing in, Romney also agrees with many Trump administration policies and hasn\u2019t taken up a McCain-like maverick mantle. Rather than relishing rhetorical fisticuffs, Romney sees himself as a voice for civility representing a deeply conservative state, said Utah State University political science professor Damon Cann.\n\n\u201cI think Romney as a senator has been much more conservative than John McCain was,\u201d both in terms of style and ideology, he said.\n\nRomney did not agree to be interviewed for this story.\n\nWhile his current position breaks from GOP ranks, he hasn\u2019t gone so far as to support the impeachment inquiry.\n\nEven if he did, it\u2019s unclear how many Republicans he might be able to sway to that view. The GOP has shifted seismically since Romney ran in 2012, away from his more cerebral approach to conservatism and toward the brand of populism that\u2019s embodied by Trump, a leader who prizes loyalty.\n\nRomney\u2019s most likely role could be behind the scenes, as a center for other moderate Republican senators, a kind of caucus of the concerned, Galen said.\n\nAs the number of Trump critics dwindles, his public comments are significant and could create some space to for others to voice concern, said Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent who ran against Trump as a third-party candidate in 2016.\n\nWhile a number of high-profile Republicans have defended the president, a number of others have remained silent, which could be an encouraging sign, he said.\n\n\u201cI think there are some Republicans in Congress who are alarmed by what they\u2019re seeing from the president now and by the reports we\u2019ve all read over the past week, but they\u2019re waiting to let the public digest these facts before more of them verbalize their own concerns,\u201d he said, \u201cif they do so at all.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mild-mannered, failed-presidential-candidate-turned-senator Mitt Romney has shown he feels compelled to speak out against President Trump at key moments.
