Now the company will see whether sacrificing its divisive leader can save a crucial fundraising effort.\n\nAdam Neumann, who co-founded WeWork and turned it into one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups, stepped down as chief executive officer Tuesday under pressure from the board. He took a new role as nonexecutive chairman and forfeit his control over management decisions.\n\nThe move is designed to salvage an IPO, which had been met with immediate scorn from public investors. A litany of apparent conflicts of interest and Neumann\u2019s propensity to burn through capital were chief concerns. \u201cIn recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction,\u201d Neumann, 40, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cI have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive.\u201d\n\nTwo senior WeWork executives, Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, were appointed as co-CEOs. WeWork\u2019s parent company, We Co., still intends to go public at some point, but people briefed on the deliberations said it\u2019s unlikely to take place as soon as next month, as was planned. The new CEOs said in a statement that they will be \u201cevaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.\u201d\n\nWe Co. has been under a tight deadline to go public. It needed to do so by the end of the year in order to secure a $6 billion debt financing contingent on a successful stock offering. The company, which is deeply unprofitable, will need to find an alternative source of capital next year if the 2019 IPO falls through. Gunningham and Minson \u201canticipate difficult decisions ahead\u201d to protect the company\u2019s \u201clong-term interests and health,\u201d they wrote in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nWith timing of an IPO now up in the air, the company is in talks with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. about a new $3 billion loan, which -- like the earlier planned financing -- would also be contingent raising a substantial amount of new equity, people with knowledge of the matter said. A likely source of that equity infusion is SoftBank Group Corp., the company\u2019s largest shareholder, the people said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the loan discussions.\n\nIn a bid to reduce costs and slow the cash burn that has spooked investors, We Co. is also considering job cuts and shedding or spinning out non-core businesses, such as WeGrow, an experimental New York City private school, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Eliminated positions would number in the thousands, one person said.\n\nAfter Neumann\u2019s decision to step aside, WeWork\u2019s high-yield bonds initially fell to as low as 92.75 cents on the dollar, their lowest level in more than four months.\n\nRett Wallace, CEO of Triton Research, said WeWork\u2019s problems run much deeper than Neumann. \u201cWeWork suffered from three things that, when put together, are not good news for a company. The first was significant losses. The second was opacity \u2014 they made it very difficult to analyze the company. And then third was arrogance,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThe only thing that changed today is possibly the third bucket.\u201d\n\nAlthough 2019 will be the busiest year of the decade for IPOs, the party has been spoiled by several underperformers. Two of the largest offerings, Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., are trading below their initial prices. Like WeWork, the ride-hailing companies bleed cash. Investors\u2019 reaction to these three stocks could force venture capitalists to rethink the value they place on a grow-at-all-costs approach to business.\n\nOver the last nine years, WeWork raised more than $12 billion and set up co-working spaces around the world, where people rent desks and conference rooms. Neumann and his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, have long promoted a higher mission for the company than being a commercial real estate landlord. They banned meat from company functions and have opened dorm-style apartment buildings, in addition to the school.\n\n\u201cThere will be changes ahead, and our leadership team will communicate transparently about them, just as we did today,\u201d McKelvey wrote in a message to staff late Tuesday. \u201cWhat I want you to know, most of all, is that even as some things change, the core of who we are never will \u2014 our culture of authenticity, inspiration, learning, and growth remains stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- WeWork\u2019s plan to go public, in one of the largest stock offerings of the year, hit a wall.
