(AP) - Sam Darnold has been eagerly preparing the last several months to get to this week.\n\nThe New York Jets are opening their season Sunday with a new coach in Adam Gase, whose aggressive and creative approach has the second-year quarterback thinking big - on the field and on the scoreboard.\n\nWhen asked what he thinks the Jets\u2018 identity is on offense, Darnold needed just one exciting adjective.\n\n\u201cElectric,\u201d Darnold said Monday. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do some fun things out there with all the tempo and all the different things we can do, so it will be fun.\n\n\u201cIt will be fun to watch us and hopefully we are going to put up a lot of points.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s hasn\u2019t been a characteristic of the Jets\u2018 offenses lately.\n\nOr, really, for the last 30 years.\n\nNew York ranked 23rd in offensive scoring last season as it sputtered to a 4-12 record. Since 1989, the Jets have finished in the top 10 in points just twice: ninth in 2008, when Brett Favre played his only season for the franchise; and fifth in 1998, when Vinny Testaverde and Curtis Martin led them to the AFC title game.\n\nIn the last seven years, New York has ranked 23rd or worse in scoring in all but one year: in 2015, when the Ryan Fitzpatrick-led Jets went 10-6 and ranked 11th overall, but failed to make the playoffs.\n\nDarnold and the Jets will try to change all that starting Sunday, when they take the field against the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to feel like a game week,\u201d Darnold said, \u201cand we\u2019re ready to kick off the season and get off on the right note.\u201d\n\nIn Miami, Gase\u2019s offenses hardly resembled a high-powered juggernaut, ranking 26th, 28th and 17th in his three seasons with the Dolphins. Gase also never had a quarterback at this stage of his development like he has with the 22-year-old Darnold.\n\nThrow in a fresh and rejuvenated Le\u2019Veon Bell at running back and the versatile Ty Montgomery, along with a set of complementary receivers in Robby Anderson, Quincy Enunwa and Jamison Crowder, and Gase will have a lot more options to run an offense at a much higher tempo than he had in Miami.\n\n\u201cI think the players we have dictate how we kind of play,\u201d Gase said recently. \u201cI think what we we\u2019re doing last year was what we had to do and what we\u2019re kind of showing right now with this year, our players are kind of telling me that\u2019s how they\u2019d like to play.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still quite a bit of intrigue leading into the opener, and it\u2019s not just surrounding how Bell will look nearly 20 months after last playing in a game.\n\nCenter Ryan Kalil came out of retirement last month and didn\u2019t play in the preseason, so there has been lots of focus on his on-field rapport with Darnold and the rest of the offensive line. Left guard Kelechi Osemele missed some time with a pectoral injury, while right guard Brian Winters was sidelined a few weeks with a shoulder injury. They\u2019re both healthy and ready to go, but the line is still jelling.\n\nEveryone is still putting the finishing touches on getting Gase\u2019s offensive playbook down. So, the \u201celectric\u201d might take some time before it\u2019s cranked at full power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m expecting there to be growing pains, but if there are, we\u2019re just going to roll with them,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cIf something happens during the course of a series, I might go to the sideline and tell Gase how I\u2019m feeling back there, how the defense is responding and all that, so we\u2019re just going to try and figure things out.\n\n\u201cBut right now, especially, we have a really good foundation for where we want to go.\u201d\n\nNOTES: OT Brent Qvale was placed on injured reserve after hurting his knee during training camp. \u2026 LB Albert McClellan was re-signed after he was released Sunday. \u2026 WR Greg Dortch, waived Monday, was signed to the practice squad, as were former Eagles RB Josh Adams and former Bears TE Ian Bunting. \u2026 Gase said Anderson (calf) and CB Trumaine Johnson (hamstring) were \u201ctrending in the right direction\u201d as far as their chances of playing Sunday. \u2026 Gase would neither confirm nor deny published reports that third-rounder Jachai Polite had been fined a total of around $100,000 for repeated violations of team policy. Polite was among the Jets\u2018 cuts Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re about the guys that do it the way that we need it done,\u201d Gase said. \u201cBest guys are going to make the team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Darnold has been eagerly preparing the last several months to get to this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/24/saints_jets_football_27148_c0-166-3120-1985_s1770x1032.jpg?5394cb6636799d27d46c6617c2c9e1051b22c9d5"}
