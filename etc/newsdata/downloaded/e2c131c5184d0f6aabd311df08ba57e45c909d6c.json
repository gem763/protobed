I have no idea. I can't speak for Arsenal, for their intentions.\n\nArsenal ended up signing Nicolas Pepe instead, who has struggled at times for form so far\n\n'If you really wanted to know how serious, how anxious they were to sign one of our players, they will have to answer the question.\n\n'But as far as Wilf is concerned, I think he needs to make certain that he gives his very best and shows off his talents every time he plays, because there are lots of teams out there looking for good players, and if he wants to attract one of those clubs, he needs to perform at the very highest level.\n\n'I don't think the fact it is Arsenal will change his performance enormously - I would hope not, because I'm expecting his performance to be very good against all the teams we play.'\n\nHowever, Pepe started to justify his price tag with a free-kick masterclass in the Europa League\n\nHodgson also said of managing Zaha so far this season: 'I thought he got over his disappointment very, very quickly and he has been good in both training and matches.'\n\nPalace are currently sixth in the Premier League, one place and and one point behind Arsenal.\n\nHodgson was speaking a day after being awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Greenwich.\n\nHe is an alumnus of the university, having graduated from Avery Hill College in 1972 with a Certificate in Education.\n\nHodgson said on Friday: 'It was very good, I'm very pleased. It was a wonderful ceremony - it's just a pity I couldn't keep the gown and cap. That was my only regret, having to give them back!'\n\nHodgson also has an honorary degree from the University of York, has been awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Croydon, and in 2012 was honoured with a knighthood by Finland.\n\nAnd he said: 'I have done pretty well over the years. My study is actually looking quite good when it comes to those things!'", "description": "The Gunners made a bid of \u00a340million for Zaha in July - a figure way below Palace chairman Steve Parish's valuation of the player - there was also interest from Everton but Zaha stayed at Palace.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/17/20187788-0-image-a-2_1572022359218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
