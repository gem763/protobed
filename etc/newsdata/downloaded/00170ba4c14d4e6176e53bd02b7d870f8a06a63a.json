Giuffre has repeatedly claimed that she had sex with Dershowitz at the behest of Jeffrey Epstein. Dershowitz has denied those claims and called Giuffre a \u201cserial perjurer\u201d and a \u201cserial prostitute.\u201d But Dershowitz asked that the defamation suit be dismissed on the grounds that he was merely repeating statements he\u2019d made earlier:\n\nDershowitz tried to claim that his 2018 and 2019 statements were just repetitions of the same comments he\u2019d made in 2015, meaning the statute of limitations had run out for Giuffre to sue him. But Judge Loretta Preska disagreed. \u201cSurveying the cases shows this ain\u2019t that,\u201d writes the judge, noting that Dershowitz\u2019s multiple statements over the years back up his self-proclaimed \u201cappreciation of chutzpah.\u201d \u201cDershowitz went looking for trouble, and by his own repeated affirmative republications, he found it,\u201d Preska wrote.\n\nHere\u2019s a video from April of this year in which Dershowitz goes on the attack against Giuffre. His description of her as a prostitute does make it seem as if he was begging for a lawsuit.\n\nWhile that refusal to dismiss the case is a loss for Dershowitz, he did succeed in having Roberts\u2019 attorney, David Boies, removed as her attorney:\n\nOne of America\u2019s most celebrated lawyers, David Boies, was disqualified Wednesday by a federal judge from representing a woman who accused financier Jeffrey Epstein and his renowned former defense attorney, Alan Dershowitz, of having sex with her when she was an underage girl. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York not only tossed Boies but also his entire law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, concluding they have become witnesses in the woman\u2019s defamation case against Dershowitz and can no longer be her advocate\u2026 The extraordinary turn of events in Giuffre\u2019s civil case \u2014 based partly on evidence of a secret recording taken by Dershowitz of his legal nemesis, Boies \u2014 means she might have to hire another law firm to represent her. Boies has cut a prominent figure as a lawyer in the U.S. government\u2019s anti-trust case against Microsoft, for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election recount, and for movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of sexually assaulting numerous Hollywood actresses.\n\nGiuffre has also claimed she was asked by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew on several occasions. Prince Andrew also denies the allegations and, like Dershowitz, claims that despite his friendship with Epstein, he had no knowledge of Epstein\u2019s behavior toward young girls. I find that a bit hard to believe though as Epstein\u2019s former lawyer Dershowitz may have had a good reason for not telling the truth about that.\n\nHere\u2019s a CBS report from July in which Dershowitz again proclaims his innocence. His defense of the illegal sweetheart deal he helped negotiate for Epstein as a \u201cnot a bad deal\u201d seems pretty laughable at this point and makes the rest of what he\u2019s saying harder to take seriously.", "description": "\"Dershowitz went looking for trouble...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Epstein-Dershowitz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
