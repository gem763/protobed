REUTERS/David Klein\n\nDespite recording 31 attempts on goal, United needed penalties to avoid a League Cup embarrassment against third-tier outfit Rochdale at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\n\nJuan Mata, Andreas Pereira, Fred, Mason Greenwood and Daniel James all converted penalties in a 5-3 shootout win but United left the pitch rather sheepishly, with their progress to the fourth round masking another disappointing performance.\n\n\u201cWe go 1-0 up in many games and, today again, we go 1-0 up and you think go on then, get the second, which is the key now,\u201d Solskjaer told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe handled it (the shootout) really well. Everyone wanted to take penalties as they did against AC Milan in Cardiff (during pre-season).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the confidence. You know we\u2019re better in penalty shootouts than in proper games.\u201d\n\nGreenwood was one of only few positives for United after 17-year-old striker recovered from tonsillitis to score for the second time in less than a week, staking his claim for a starting berth against Arsenal in the Premier League on Monday.\n\n\u201cMason Greenwood has two great feet. He\u2019s a nightmare for defenders... he can go both ways,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cYou can just see that he\u2019s got quality. He will get his share of games. He\u2019s young and we have to allow him to grow.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer confirmed Marcus Rashford\u2019s groin injury is not as bad as initially feared and the England forward can return within the next two weeks.\n\nRashford came off injured in the 2-0 defeat at West Ham United last weekend.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not very, very bad,\u201d Solskjaer told MUTV. \u201cWe hope to see him before the international break.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants his players to be more ruthless in open play, saying they are better in penalty shootouts than in games at the moment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434002975&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P073", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
