Police fired at protesters in the Mong Kok district, a frequent scene of large protests.\n\nA statement from the police on Saturday night said protesters \u201cbehaved in a disorderly manner, threw stones at the station and aimed laser beams at police officers. Such acts threatened the safety of members of the public and police officers.\u201d\n\nPolice officials claimed they used \u201cthe minimum force necessary\u201d to contain the situation. It was not clear from weekend reports if the shots heard in the district were lethal or non-lethal weapons.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s MTR rail system reported several of its stations were vandalized over the weekend, with arson reported in two cases. MTR stations have been damaged on numerous occasions because the protesters feel the rail system is colluding with Hong Kong\u2019s pro-China government against them.\n\nBoycotts and vandalism have been directed against other businesses seen as supporting the Chinese Communist regime against the protest movement, notably including the Starbucks coffee chain, whose stores in Hong Kong are operated by a restaurant corporation owned by a family that has made statements supporting the police and denouncing protesters as radicals.\n\nA more restrained demonstration against police violence is being staged by elderly demonstrators who have announced they will sit outside police headquarters in the Wan Chai district for two days. The older protesters say they are especially concerned about the use of force against young people.\n\nPolice officials said on Monday that violence at the protests has escalated to a \u201clife-threatening level\u201d because on Sunday night a small improvised explosive was detonated near a police car and a police officer was slashed in the neck with a knife.\n\n\u201cThey are not protesters, they are rioters and criminals. Whatever cause they are fighting for it never justifies such violence,\u201d said deputy police commissioner Tang Ping-keung.\n\nThe Associated Press noted a shift in tactics by the more aggressive protesters over the weekend as they began working in small, fast-moving groups that were harder for the police to arrest. The knife attack reported on Sunday night was the work of one such group, while another was videotaped knocking a riot police officer to the ground, beating him, and attempting to take his gun.\n\nThe AP thought that despite the spirited acts of defiance against the mask ban, it actually seems to have \u201ccooled the ardor of some demonstrators and whittled down protest numbers\u201d as the popular uprising enters its fifth month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer possible to get a hundred thousand people to come out,\u201d one of the senior demonstrators conceded. He said the new strategy is to \u201ckeep the hunt dogs running everywhere, getting crazier and crazier, without catching the prey,\u201d by which he meant the police.\n\nThe protest movement was able to summon enough manpower to haul the \u201cLady Liberty\u201d statue \u2013 a 12-foot, 180-pound depiction of a female protester wearing a gas mask brandishing an umbrella, a symbol of democracy in Hong Kong, and a flag reading \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution Of Our Times\u201d \u2013 to the top of the highly visible Lion Rock overlooking the city.\n\n\u201cWe had a team of 16 climbing professionals carrying her in two main pieces all the way to the summit while another 16 members carried equipment and supplies,\u201d the creator of the statue said proudly.\n\nThe climbing team said Lion Rock, long viewed as symbolic of Hong Kong\u2019s libertarian spirit and often festooned with protest banners, would be a fitting \u201cfinal resting place\u201d for the Lady Liberty statue, which until now has been trucked around to various locations across the city during protest rallies.", "description": "Hong Kong saw more huge protests over the weekend, many of them explicitly directed at the new emergency law banning masks.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/protest-sunday-in-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
