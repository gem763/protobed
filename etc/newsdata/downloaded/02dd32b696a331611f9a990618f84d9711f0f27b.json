James caused seething outrage in Hong Kong after he said Monday night Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d when he tweeted his support for the pro-democracy protesters. James doubled down in a series of tweets later, again saying Morey decision to tweet the message on the eve of the NBA's exhibition trip to China was bad timing.\n\nIn response, a large group among the throngs of Hong Kong demonstrators were seen stomping on jerseys and shirts bearing the superstar's name -- and even gathered to watch the burning of one of the garments.\n\nLEBRON JAMES' CRITICISM OF HONG KONG TWEET FROM DARYL MOREY RECEIVES BACKLASH ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nJames, who has been one of the most outspoken athletes on social justice issues in the U.S. in a league that prides itself on being one of the most progressive in sports, was deferential to the NBA and the Chinese government when he broke his silence about Morey\u2019s remarks days after his return to the U.S. after playing two preseason games in China. Morey had tweeted, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d last week prior to the Rockets\u2019 preseason games in Japan.\n\nThe tweet had consequential effects on the NBA\u2019s bottom line, with the Chinese government blacking out games on its streaming service Tencent and several Chinese sportswear brands suspending or cutting ties with the Rockets. It was in that climate that James made his first comments about the controversy Monday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI just think that, when you\u2019re misinformed or you\u2019re not educated about something \u2013 and I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2013 you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\u201d\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS' GREGG POPOVICH PREFERS ADAM SILVER'S LEADERSHIP TO TRUMP'S\n\nHe added in a tweet: \u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong, protesters blasted James\u2019 message.\n\n\u201cPeople are angry,\u201d said James Lo, a web designer who runs a basketball fan page on Facebook. He added he expects more backlash from protesters who have been demonstrating on the streets and battling police because of concerns that the international business hub is losing its freedoms.\n\n\u201cStudents, they come out like every weekend,\u201d James Lo said. \u201cThey've got tear-gassed and then they got gun-shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then he just comes up with something [like that tweet]. We just can't accept that.\u201d\n\nProtesters also said that James\u2019 comments amounted to a double-standard because the Los Angeles Lakers star has used his fame and celebrity to press for social issues unique to the U.S.\n\nNBA SHOWS 'NO SPINE' REGARDING CHINA'S ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES: FOX SPORTS RADIO'S CLAY TRAVIS\n\n\u201cPlease remember, all NBA players, what you said before: 'Black lives matter.' Hong Kong lives also matter!\u201d William Mok said to an applauding crowd of protesters.\n\nOthers said James was likely more worried about protecting his wealth than the geopolitical issues of his Hong Kong supporters.\n\n\u201cJames was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is like ridiculous,\u201d Aaron Lee, a 36-year-old marketing director, said. \u201cHe was being honest, financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.\u201d\n\nBefore wading into the Hong Kong controversy, James had been vocally supportive of social justice causes. On his HBO discussion show, \"The Shop,\" James in March discussed his respect for former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the trend of taking a knee during the national anthem to draw attention to perceived racial biases in the justice system. But Kaepernick soon found himself without a job, as NFL franchises uniformly declined to bring the lightning rod player aboard.\n\n\"Kap stood for something that was bigger than him,\" James said. \"How many people can wake up and say 'You know what, I'll give up everything that I've worked for my whole life, for the better of the conversation. I'm gonna lose everything I've got personally to better the conversation?'\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn January 2018, James tweeted a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: \"-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere- Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Cody Derespina and the AP contributed to this report.", "description": "It's not the first time\u00a0LeBron James\u00a0has seen people burn his jersey because of something he's said.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
