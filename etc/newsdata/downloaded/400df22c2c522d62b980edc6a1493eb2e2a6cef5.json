As we noted in last week\u2019s , the economy performed admirably under Trudeau\u2019s first term, with hitting a 40+ year low, growing at among the highest rates for a developed country, and the Canadian stock market providing strong returns.\n\nWhile Trudeau was ultimately victorious, he didn\u2019t emerge unscathed. His Liberal party actually lost the popular vote, as well as its Parliamentary majority, and will therefore have to form coalitions to legislate, with the pro-labor New Democratic Party (NDP) emerging as the most likely partner. There\u2019s no doubt that Trudeau\u2019s \u201cmandate\u201d has been weakened, but he has nonetheless vowed to pursue a left-leaning agenda focusing on social issues, deficit spending to address inequality, and aggressive environmental reforms.\n\nMarket Reaction\n\nA narrow Liberal victory was the market\u2019s expected scenario, albeit with a heavy dose of uncertainty, so the reaction in the and Canada\u2019s stock market has been relatively subdued so far. Looking ahead, Trudeau\u2019s agenda is likely to lead to further deficit spending to support social, inequality, and environmental reforms.\n\nThat said, the country has had a relatively balanced budget in recent years, with its government deficit running at less than 1% of GDP (by contrast, the US\u2019s deficit was last clocked at nearly 4% of GDP and has been rising in each of the last four years); put another way, Canada\u2019s budget could afford a dose of deficit spending, and it may serve to insulate the economy and stock market from external shocks including falling oil prices or declining international trade.\n\nAfter falling nearly 300 pips from peak to trough over the last two weeks, is seeing a slight bounce at the start of today\u2019s North American session. As it stands, the RSI indicator is confirming last week\u2019s breakdown in price and the MACD is signaling strong bearish momentum, trending lower below both its signal line and the \u201c0\u201d level. Moving forward, the technical bias in the pair remains bearish as long as rates hold below previous-support-turned-resistance at 1.3135, with potential for a move down toward the year-to-date low at 1.3015 in time.\n\nSource: Trading View, FOREX.com", "description": "Forex Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: USD/CAD.
