(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nMike Dixon left his first visit to his son\u2019s new school deflated. The Dixons had scored a seat at a Chinese-language charter school in the District that families clamor to attend.\n\nHis children would be attending a diverse public school \u2014 a rarity in a city where most schools are segregated and the student population is overwhelmingly black.\n\nBut when Dixon attended a school open house in 2012, he was one of the few black parents in the room. And when he returned for an evening parent meeting, he was again one of the only black parents. He believed he didn\u2019t belong, so he stopped attending.\n\nAs cities across the country gentrify \u2014 and schools in those cities slowly begin to diversify \u2014 communities are struggling to ensure that all parents have an equal voice. Parent organizations have emerged as a striking, and consequential, example of the cultural, economic and language divides among families.\n\nFor Dixon, it felt as if parents were vetting him at those first two meetings, determining whether he should be there.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like this is our space, and we need to ask some qualifying questions: Where do you live, where do you come from? And you can feel that,\u201d said Dixon, a native Washingtonian. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging as a black father because there is less power \u2014 at least perceived \u2014 in the school.\u201d\n\nParents of color have long spoken of feeling alienated from parent organizations \u2014 many schools in low-income neighborhoods do not even have formal parent groups. And drastic fundraising disparities between parent groups at schools in wealthy neighborhoods and those in lower-income areas has been extensively researched.\n\nNow, a small but growing number of researchers and organizations are focused on what happens within these parent organizations at schools in gentrifying neighborhoods.\n\nTheir findings: White and wealthy families often enter predominantly black and Hispanic schools, assume leadership roles and push for what\u2019s best for their children \u2014 not always realizing that it may not be what\u2019s best for the entire student body, according to Alexandra Freidus, an educational ethnographer at Seton Hall University.\n\nParents across all demographic groups care fervently about their children\u2019s education, but, Freidus said, families have varying amounts of time and resources.\n\nAnd there are tangible consequences to who holds these leadership positions. Freidus, whose research focuses on gentrifying New York schools, said she frequently observes parent-teacher organizations invest money in lower grades. Those are the grades that often see the biggest jump in affluent and white enrollment in historically low-income neighborhoods.\n\nWhen affluent parents arrived at one D.C. school, they pushed for a costlier after-school program that alienated low-income families who couldn\u2019t afford it, according to research by Esa Syeed, a former D.C. schoolteacher who is now a sociologist at California State University at Long Beach.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you are a customer that can make demands at a public school is a very specific kind of idea,\u201d Freidus said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your level of trust in social services and public institutions and your history with those places that may influence whether you think it is a good idea to draw attention to yourself.\u201d\n\nThat dynamic reflected Dixon\u2019s own relationship with his children\u2019s school. His mother was involved in his elementary and middle schools decades earlier, but he had never witnessed parents advocate for wide policy and curriculum changes like those at his children\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cI always looked at the school as an authority figure instead of a service provider,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized that there was so much privilege that I haven\u2019t experienced, that it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, but that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Mike Dixon first attended a meeting at his children\u2019s school in the District \u2014 Washington Yu Ying Public Charter School \u2014 he was one of the few black parents there. He stopped attending. Now, he\u2019s part of an initiative to make sure all parents\u2019 voices are heard. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n* * *\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Laura Wilson Phelan, who served as Ward 1 representative on the D.C. State Board of Education until 2019, to notice something troubling.\n\nHer ward covers a diverse and rapidly gentrifying swath of the city, but she fielded calls and emails mostly from white parents. Even if a school\u2019s student body was less than 5 percent white, those parents often held most of the positions on the PTO.\n\nWhen she heard from low-income families \u2014 overwhelmingly black and Hispanic in the District \u2014 they would often be calling about a personal issue or conflict affecting their child at school. Wealthier families called about the need for more resources on campus and urged systemic changes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the luxury you can have when the system serves your child well,\u201d Phelan said. \u201cYou can put your head up because it isn\u2019t an emergency.\u201d\n\nSo Phelan decided to challenge how adults perceive themselves \u2014 and other families \u2014 by creating a nonprofit in 2016 aimed at bringing together parents and grandparents from different backgrounds.\n\nFor three years, her organization, called Kindred, has gone to D.C. public schools to speak with families about race and their experiences on campus.\n\nAfter eight sessions, parents meet with school faculty to discuss what they hope to see from teachers and staff. The next year, parents in the original group lead discussions with other parents.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, white families can walk in a world in which their ideas will be immediately accepted,\u201d Phelan said. \u201cRunning for PTO president seems like a very natural and accepted thing.\u201d\n\nSince Phelan established Kindred, the organization has expanded to more than a dozen charter and traditional public schools, with eight full-time employees and an annual budget of $1.3 million.\n\nOne of the campuses that contracted with Kindred was Washington Yu Ying Public Charter School, the Chinese immersion school Dixon\u2019s children attend.\n\nSchool leaders first asked Dixon\u2019s wife, a hairdresser, to attend. But Dixon, an engineer who was out of a full-time job and working part time as an Uber driver, had a more flexible schedule. Five years after that initial open house at the school, Dixon grudgingly went to the first Kindred meeting.\n\nAnd then he surprised himself \u2014 he went back. And back again.\n\nAnd then he volunteered for parent leadership roles at the school.\n\n\u201cThe white families that I met \u2014 and we talk about it \u2014 are just really unaware of the challenges that these black families have,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cAnd I feel like through this process, they have been able to be aware.\u201d\n\nMaquita Alexander, Yu Ying\u2019s principal, said black parents never told her they felt uncomfortable at the school, but she always sensed it.\n\nShe now notices parents across socioeconomic groups talking in the hallways since the sessions with the facilitators. Families who had never carpooled are asking each other for rides.\n\n\u201cWe have always been a \u2018rip the Band Aid off and let\u2019s fix it\u2019 kind of school,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cParents are much more comfortable about having conversations about race.\u201d\n\nWhile Dixon was looking for work, Kindred trained him to be a facilitator for the program. He works more than 20 hours each week leading parent groups across the District.\n\n\u201cToday, we are going to talk about racism,\u201d Dixon said to a group of white, black and Hispanic parents at an elementary school in Northwest Washington in the spring, \u201cwhen we have maybe fueled racism, and when someone has made us feel other than.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThe mother expressed what other black parents at her child\u2019s elementary school on Capitol Hill were thinking.\n\n\u201cSome parents feel their voices aren\u2019t heard,\u201d she said in the drab lounge at the school in a gentrifying neighborhood.\n\nThe other black parents at the Kindred meeting nodded in agreement.\n\nA white father, a PTO officer, responded that he hopes to include more diverse voices, but when he emails parents requesting help, it\u2019s mostly the white parents who respond.\n\n\u201cThe intent was there, for better or worse,\u201d he said.\n\nKindred allowed The Washington Post to attend five, 90-minute meetings at three schools in recent months on the condition that parents not be named so they could be speak freely.\n\nA mother bluntly offered why black parents may not be responding to the PTO emails: \u201cIt\u2019s different when you have a white person coming into a majority black school.\u201d\n\nThe man agreed, aware of the dynamics of a school that had been entirely black for generations and has only recently experienced white students enrolling in the lower grades.\n\n\u201cI literally felt like a usurper my first year here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe black and white parents agreed: Perhaps it would be more effective if black and white parents reached out together to families.\n\nParents from different backgrounds conceded they did not have extended conversation in the hallways.\n\nOne black mother recalled that when she purchased a school shirt from white parents selling them on campus, no one really spoke to her \u2014 even as she spent the money she had scrounged from driving extra shifts for Uber.\n\nThe white father acknowledged that the mother was right. Parents were spending their hard-earned money on school spirit items, and he should have used it as an opportunity to get to know the other parents.\n\nThe conversations sounded similar at the Northwest Washington school where Dixon was a Kindred facilitator. The school has mostly black and Hispanic students, but there\u2019s a growing number of white children.\n\nOne white father of a preschool-aged child said he hated attending schoolwide meetings because the staff spoke to parents as if they were stupid. He said he imagined administrators did not treat parents that way west of Rock Creek Park, referring to the wealthiest corner of the District.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t talk to parents like that at all schools?\u201d a black parent asked. \u201cI thought that was everywhere.\u201d\n\nNo, the white parent said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep my third eye open on that,\u201d the black father said.\n\nA black grandmother said she felt as though her grandson\u2019s teacher was afraid of her, that the educator didn\u2019t know how to approach her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very outspoken,\u201d the grandmother said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she gives him the proper attention.\u201d\n\nA young Hispanic mother who spoke little English said, with the help of an interpreter hired by Kindred, that her young son was not receiving the services required by his special-education plan. When she asked about it, she was told her son no longer needed that service \u2014 even though she believed he did.\n\nThe parents in the group were shocked and offered to help her demand those services.\n\nThere were some uncomfortable laughs, too, as parents confronted their biases.\n\n\u201cDo you ever see someone walk down the street and clutch your purse?\u201d a black parent asked.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, I have,\u201d a white woman admitted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your purse,\u201d a black father joked. They had just learned they lived blocks apart.\n\nThroughout it all, Dixon was there, sharing his experiences as a black father in the District, understanding how easily some voices can be muffled.\n\nAnd then, keeping with their weekly tradition, the parents rearranged the classroom desks, took out their cellphones and shared pictures of their children with each other.\n\n\n\nParents of students who attend Bancroft Elementary meet to discuss the racial dynamics between families and schools.
