I feel abandoned, betrayed and furious. There are no words for the rage I feel. We\u2019re the collateral damage in the government\u2019s war with the EU.\u201d\n\nThe UK government announced last month that if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal the estimated 180,000 retired British nationals in the bloc whose healthcare costs it funds would continue to be covered for six months.\n\nMost of the 1 million Britons in the EU are earners, so pay into the health systems of the EU member states they live in. Their healthcare arrangements should be unaffected by a no-deal Brexit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Denise Abel.

Private health insurance was also beyond the means of many retired people, who are likely to have pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cThey are left with the very real prospect of having no healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in many countries, without healthcare you are no longer legally resident. There\u2019s really a lot of fear. We\u2019ve had hundreds of people contact us. Many are elderly, some have terminal illnesses \u2013 they are genuinely petrified.\u201d\n\nIn March the government also pledged, subject to reciprocal agreements with EU27 states, to cover the costs of treatments that begin before Brexit day for up to 12 months. But the announcements have done little to relieve the mounting anxiety of many retired Britons on the continent.\n\nValerie Chaplin, 68, moved to southern Spain with her husband, Eric, soon after he retired nearly 20 years ago. Diagnosed last year with breast cancer, she has had two major operations and radiotherapy and will be on medication for five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a living nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get it out of your head; you have to keep busy or you\u2019d just sit and howl. There\u2019s no way I could ever afford to pay for private healthcare, or even to join the Spanish system. Eric is 87 now; he has high blood pressure, high cholesterol \u2026 I just feel completely abandoned.\u201d\n\nMonthly contributions to the Spanish healthcare system covering just \u201cthe basics\u201d would cost the couple \u20ac165 (\u00a3147) each, said Chaplin, a former nurse. \u201cMy treatment would be \u20ac425 a month. We live on \u20ac1,600. What I dread most is something happening to my husband \u2013 I\u2019d be down to about \u20ac600 a month.\u201d\n\nThe couple could not afford to return to the UK even if they wanted to, she said: \u201cI know some Brits will go back, and have gone back. But we have nothing there and our house here is worth \u20ac50,000. We\u2019ll just stay on, without healthcare, until we pop off. It\u2019s like our death warrant has been signed.\u201d\n\nAbel, a retired psychologist who will be 63 this month, moved to Norcia in Perugia, Italy, with her husband, a specialist petrochemicals engineer two years her senior. As a worker posted temporarily to the EU and continuing to pay UK national insurance, he was initially covered by the S1 reciprocal scheme, she said.\n\n\u201cHe started to get less work after the referendum, because clients were worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to travel and work across the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cThen last summer he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. Because he hasn\u2019t been able to work, he has now lost his S1. We have no more cover.\u201d\n\nAs EU citizens, the couple cannot currently pay into the Italian healthcare system, and because of her husband\u2019s condition they have been quoted a premium of \u20ac13,000 a year for private health cover. After Britain leaves the EU, Italian social security contributions could be \u20ac3,500 a year.\n\nThe couple are paying out of their own pockets for Italian GP visits, scans, neurologist and physiotherapist appointments and all medication \u2013 and cannot move back to the UK because they are housed in a 40m2 cabin after their home was destroyed by a major earthquake in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe irony is, with his medication he is now well enough to return to work,\u201d Abel said. \u201cBut he won\u2019t qualify for an S1 form until he has a full year of UK social security contributions, by which time the scheme could well be defunct and he will be due to retire. It\u2019s quite desperate.\u201d\n\nAbel was bitter. Italy was now their home, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t recognise my country. All the Brexit discussion is about the Irish border, trade, the economy \u2013 but what about us? The focus should surely also be on people. Brexiters say we must get it done, do or die \u2013 I say, who is most likely to die?\u201d\n\nIn south-west France, a couple of former engineers who asked not to be named said their situation was becoming \u201cincreasingly, and incredibly, stressful\u201d. After leaving the UK in 2007 when the husband, now 72, retired, the wife, now 63, was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer that has since spread to her spine.\n\n\u201cThe treatment has been brilliant,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my oncologist has asked who will be paying for it after Brexit. The pharmacist has asked the same about my medication. Of course, they may not be right \u2013 but nobody knows. It just gets into your mind. I\u2019m constantly running through scenarios, and it\u2019s driving me round the bend.\u201d\n\nWhile eventually Britain would be likely to conclude bilateral reciprocal healthcare agreements with EU27 states in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there is, more than three years after the referendum, still no certainty about how long that could take or what they will cover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a planner, I like to mitigate, and now I simply can\u2019t do that,\u201d the wife said. \u201cMy husband\u2019s S1 \u2013 and mine, eventually, when I reached retirement age \u2013 was one of the reasons we felt able to move here. Now we don\u2019t know what the arrangements will be, what it will cost, how we\u2019ll be able to pay \u2026 No one can tell me.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if the pound tanks again? The strain is really unrelenting. You lose sleep over it. You just want it to go away - and then every once in a while, it just ratchets up a notch. And the worst is, they don\u2019t care. They just want to deliver their mantra. We\u2019re just collateral damage.\u201d", "description": "Reciprocal scheme in which NHS reimburses cost of treatment will cease under a no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76fabc81c7ebe54179e60fa8d3ad1573514bf0f/0_235_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbf808997498649e0d91480fdbc13e51", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
