( LULU ) generated a number of weakening signals in the past four weeks. A more defensive posture may be needed ahead of its upcoming earnings release. Let's check out the charts and indicators to see if the long side or the short side fits better.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of LULU, below, we can see that the uptrend from the late December low was broken in early August. The rising 50-day moving average line was also broken last month and prices have struggled at the underside of that average line. The trading volume shows a surge in the middle of June and then a decline even as prices made new highs in July.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a peak in mid-June and a slight decline from there suggesting that sellers of LULU have become more aggressive. The 12-day price momentum study shows lower highs from the middle of June into August telling us that momentum has slowed and this could be foreshadowing a bearish price contraction.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of LULU, below, we see a mixed picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line and prices are up three-fold in the past three years.\n\nThe weekly OBV has been in a long rise confirming the price gains, but the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of LULU, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $152.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Traders and recent longs might want to consider lightening long positions as a correction to the $150 area could unfold in the weeks ahead.", "description": "Shares of Lululemon Might See Some Shrinkage Near-Term...LULU", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Shares Of Lululemon Might See Some Shrinkage Near-Term", "A More Defensive Posture May Be Needed Ahead Of Its Upcoming Earnings Release.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Kevin Curran", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9c61d8d7-515c-11e9-a65a-375d6b4a261c.png"}
