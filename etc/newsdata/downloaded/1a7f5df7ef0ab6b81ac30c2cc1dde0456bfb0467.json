The Cowboys were down 31-10 at the time and desperately needed the spark that catch would have provided.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nDuring the play, it looked like Cooper hauled in the ball with his left foot inbounds while dragging his right toe. It was a great play, and Garrett responded to the call on the field by berating the official as he slammed his challenge flag to the ground.\n\nThe referee didn\u2019t take kindly to that, hitting Garrett with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.\n\nGarrett\u2019s challenge ended up succeeding, giving Dallas the ball at their own 42-yard line but facing a first-and-25.\n\nThe Cowboys overcame that obstacle, driving down the field and scoring on an Ezekiel Elliott touchdown. That pulled the score to 31-17, but the Cowboys eventually fell 34-24, lowering their record to 3-2.\n\nJason Garrett and Jerry Jones react to flag after game\n\nGarrett was diplomatic toward the officiating crew after the game, saying he had mishandled the situation.\n\n\"Obviously, I didn't handle that situation as well as I should have,\u201d Garrett said, per ESPN. \u201cI knew we were going to get the play because I saw it and unfortunately we had to use that flag there. And he made the decision to throw a flag on me.\"\n\nReferee Ron Torbert reportedly explained to a pool reporter that the flag was for \u201cabusive language toward an official,\u201d rather than the manner Garrett threw the flag.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones wasn\u2019t impressed with that explanation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Oh, I hope the little darling didn't hear something he hadn't heard before,\" Jones said, per ESPN. \"We should all stop the wheel over that if he got [a penalty for] abusive language.\"\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "A missed call on an Amari Cooper catch caused the Cowboys coach to hurt a referee's feelings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ijh0416Jddd4F6X2je3Kng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aGxFHbFKJw.BtaX3lfAhYQ--~B/aD0xODU3O3c9Mjc4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3b27ae00-e898-11e9-bf7f-454bd276b138", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
