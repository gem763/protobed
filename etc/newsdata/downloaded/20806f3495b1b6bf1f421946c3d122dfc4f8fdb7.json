The White House witnesses\n\nThe Trump-Zelensky phone call was not a simple one-on-one conversation between two leaders. Such conversations never are. In fact, there were many people in the White House listening to the call and making notes of what the two men said. The whistleblower wrote, \u201cBased on my understanding, there were approximately a dozen White House officials who listened to the call \u2014 a mixture of policy officials and duty officers in the White House Situation Room, as is customary.\u201d The whistleblower said State Department official T. Ulrich Brechbuhl also listened, but CBS later reported that Brechbuhl was not, in fact, on the call.\n\nHowever many there were, impeachment investigators will want to interview everyone who heard the call. \u201cWe intend to follow the facts where they lead us, and that also means trying to interview the folks that were detailed in the complaint,\u201d said Democratic Representative Denny Heck, a member of the Intelligence Committee, on MSNBC Thursday night.\n\nWhether they will able to do so is another matter. There will undoubtedly be privilege claims and other objections that might end up in court. And the resolution of those cases could hinge on the issue discussed above, whether courts will accept Pelosi\u2019s simple declaration of an impeachment inquiry as proof that the House is formally involved in a judicial proceeding. In the end, it is not clear whether House Democrats will be able to hear from everyone involved.", "description": "", "authors": ["Byron York", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News Eight-Keys-To-The-Coming-Trump-Impeachment-Fight"], "top_image": ""}
