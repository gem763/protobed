But NASA is hoping that\u2019s about to change. This is the new era of space exploration. And it\u2019s even more ambitious than before. In May 2019, NASA officially announced its new project, Artemis.\n\nDave Mosher: Artemis is NASA\u2019s big plan to go back to the moon by 2024, to land the first woman and the next man on the surface of the moon.\n\nNarrator: The mission was named in homage to Apollo\u2019s twin sister, Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt and the moon. But just because it bears a similar name doesn\u2019t make it an Apollo rerun. Where Apollo astronauts only spent hours or days on the lunar surface, Artemis astronauts will potentially spend weeks there to explore it for resources and investigate the far side of the moon, as well as to test technologies for future deep-space missions. This will give scientists a much better understanding of the solar system, its history, and how to operate in deep space. And that\u2019s the pressing reason for this mission.\n\nMosher: But it\u2019s also a dry run for going to Mars, which is much father and much harder. The journey, instead of being three days to the moon, is six to nine months. So you need to practice these deep-space operations, and you also need to practice surface operations. The moon is a great place to go for that because it\u2019s so close.\n\nNarrator: But even though it\u2019s close, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cheap. NASA said it will need $US20 billion to $US30 billion for the next mission. That\u2019s up to $US6 billion annually over the next five years, and that\u2019s on top of its current $US20-billion-plus annual budget. Though, for comparison, $US30 billion is only about 4% of the US\u2019s annual military budget. Or about three of the Navy\u2019s newest nuclear submarines. Now, a lot of Artemis\u2019 budget will go towards building NASA\u2019s next-generation rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS.\n\nMosher: Space Launch System is this gargantuan rocket that will actually take the astronauts into orbit around Earth and a bunch of the equipment they need to go up there, too.\n\nNarrator: Once finished, it will be the most powerful rocket ever made. But things with the SLS haven\u2019t exactly gone to plan.\n\nMosher: The first rocket was supposed to launch in 2017, and it\u2019s now 2019 and they\u2019re not looking to launch the first one until 2021. So they\u2019re years behind schedule, billions of dollars over budget, and they\u2019re supposed to make one of these every year or two going forward.\n\nNarrator: To top it off, SLS isn\u2019t reusable, like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy. So that means after each launch, the rocket will be discarded. That\u2019s an estimated $US1.5 billion to $US3 billion NASA won\u2019t get back for every launch. And that raises the question, why doesn\u2019t it just team up with SpaceX and use the Falcon Heavy?\n\nMosher: The advantages of SLS is that it\u2019s just bigger, and that\u2019s important if you\u2019re trying to get big space-station modules and lunar landers out into space.\n\nNarrator: Estimates show the Falcon Heavy could launch a payload of about 21,000 kilograms to the moon, whereas NASA says the SLS will lift more than twice that. So, yeah, size definitely matters, but it\u2019s also about\u2026\n\nMosher: Politics, jobs, and other missions. So, politics, because these people in Congress who pull the purse strings have a lot of districts where NASA centres are located. The second part, jobs, is because there are tens of thousands of people employed to build and maintain and do all the things you need to do to create Space Launch System. And the third part is that NASA is legally bound to use this rocket for some missions, including the Europa Clipper, which is supposed to go out to Jupiter and look for signs of life around one of its icy moons.\n\nNarrator: Now, contrary to old sci-fi films, rockets don\u2019t land on the moon. There\u2019s a series of steps that happen first, including rocket-stage separations and reaching lunar orbit. Now, for Apollo astronauts, they flew their spacecraft into lunar orbit, undocked the lunar lander, and rode it down to the surface. Artemis has bigger plans. Like Apollo, Artemis will fly a spacecraft called Orion towards the moon. But then, instead of orbiting the moon by itself, it will dock at what NASA has dubbed the Gateway.\n\nMosher: The Gateway is kind of like this orbital outpost for the moon. It\u2019s the place you go to sort of stock up, get everything you need, get your affairs in order.\n\nNarrator: So, it will act as a living space for astronauts going to and from the moon. But it will also house an in-space laboratory and be a port for future deep-space missions, such as a trip to Mars. After two test missions to the moon\u2019s orbit, NASA plans to start building the Gateway in 2022, but astronauts still need a way to and from the lunar surface. That\u2019s where the lunar lander comes in. And this is one part of the mission NASA might not build.\n\nMosher: Its administrator has said, look, commercial space, like companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX, they\u2019re getting better at this than we are.\n\nNarrator: Whether NASA decides to team up or not is a mystery right now. But if anything is certain, it\u2019s that temporary trips to and from the moon will only be the start. Ultimately, NASA wants a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work on the moon.\n\nMosher: So, after the first landing, in 2024, NASA is hoping to do one, about one a year, through 2028, set up this moon base, and then we\u2019re really talking about something interesting, which is mining the moon for water. Water you can split into hydrogen and oxygen, which are two really important rocket fuels.\n\nNarrator: Right now, humans are limited to how far we can travel in space by the amount of fuel in our rocket tanks at launch. But once you can make rocket fuel in space, then you can travel much farther.\n\nMosher: They want to set up this lunar base on the surface to mine all the water and make the Gateway this big, go-to destination for refuelling and this pit stop for Mars.\n\nNarrator: And then, if they can figure all that out?\n\nMosher: We\u2019re talking about expanding the reach of the human race throughout the solar system.\n\nNarrator: Sounds great in theory, but in reality, there\u2019s gonna be some tension.\n\nMosher: The politics of the moon are going to get very weird in the coming decades if we start building permanent human bases there. China wants to go there, NASA wants to go there, SpaceX wants to go there, but international space law basically says you can\u2019t claim any territory in space or on another planet, another body.\n\nNarrator: That\u2019s right, space law. In 1967, the United Nations founded the Outer Space Treaty. Ratified by 109 countries, this first treaty sets boundaries for space travel. There have been four more treaties since, but the last was signed decades ago. So, currently, space law is pretty outdated.\n\nMosher: The international space law has to catch up to the current times. And we haven\u2019t done that yet.\n\nNarrator: For example, it lacks clarity, especially with regards to mining resources. There is nothing on who would own the resources, whether they would need a licence, or how to settle disputes, or even who can approve the mining in the first place. Solving these and other issues will be key to the new era of space exploration envisioned by NASA. If it happens, that is.\n\nMosher: There isn\u2019t the political willpower, because of that, and we\u2019re really pinched for dollars, with all of the domestic issues and climate change and other major priorities that are happening here on Earth. So whether or not NASA can pull this off remains to be seen.\n\nNarrator: But even if NASA doesn\u2019t, maybe someone else will.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
