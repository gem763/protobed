(This includes Google Maps, Calendar, Google Drive, Google Assistant and Gmail.) Instead, it will reportedly come with third-party alternatives running on a bespoke version of Android 10. Here are the details.\n\nAs reported by Ausdroid, Huawei officially confirmed at IFA 2019 that its upcoming Mate 30 smartphone will not be running Google\u2019s apps or services. The decision was essentially forced on both businesses by a US executive order banning American telecommunications firms from using Huawei equipment.\n\nAt the IFA conference, Dr Wang Chenglu, Huawei\u2019s president of consumer software, said the company was in the process of developing alternatives to Google apps and services, including GPS navigation.\n\nDespite the loss of Google apps, it appears the Mate 30 will still be running on the latest version of Android, albeit an open-source iteration. In other words, the company's much-touted rival OS - Harmony - won't be making its debut on the Mate 30 (at least, not in western markets.)\n\nThis is a bitter pill to swallow for Huawei fans and is sure to have an impact on global sales. While the Android ecosystem isn't as fenced in as Apple's iOS, apps like Google Maps and Gmail are essential to most users. Expecting customers to use third-party alternatives or implement workarounds to access these apps is a very big ask.\n\nOn the hardware side, the Huawei Mate 30 is looking a lot more promising. It will reportedly be powered by the latest Kirin 990 processor, support 5G networks in Australia and have a gargantuan rear quad camera that improves on Huawei's industry-leading P30 Pro.\n\nWe'll know more when the phone launches against the odds on September 18. But based on these developments, things aren't looking rosy for the Huwaei Mate 30.\n\nRIP Huawei Mate 30 Pro. We Hardly Knew Ye If you've been eyeing the Huawei Mate 30 Pro as a potential phone replacement, you might want to reconsider. Google has confirmed that the model will be banned from using Google-licensed apps and services. At the very least, this means no Play Store access, no Google applications and no Android 10.
