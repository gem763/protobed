Ro Khanna (D-CA), an impeachment supporter. \u201cI do think this is going to probably move more of the members to start calling for that [impeachment] hearing\u2026 My guess is, those numbers are going to continue to go up.\u201d\n\nSeveral reports have indicated that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint focuses on a call that Trump had with the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged him to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, in the country. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani had already pushed Zelensky to open such an investigation and has admitted to as much in recent interviews.\n\nThe full content of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint had been blocked from coming to lawmakers, despite it being an \u201curgent\u201d matter that legally mandates congressional notification, by Trump\u2019s acting Director of National Intelligence. And the stream of news \u2014which suggests Trump pressured a foreign government to conduct investigations beneficial to his 2020 re-election campaign, with the possible threat of security aid withdrawal\u2014has fired up House Democrats who are in favor of impeachment.\n\n\u201cColleagues in Congress: if this isn't impeachable abuse of power, what is?\u201d asked Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) on Twitter Friday afternoon. \u201cI'm sick of the parsing, dithering & political overcalculating.\u201d\n\nA Democratic aide, speaking anonymously to discuss the mood in the caucus, put it even more bluntly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the hell any of us are here if we\u2019re not going to impeach him for this,\u201d the aide said. \u201cTrump has no reason to change, because we won\u2019t make him.\u201d\n\nBut it remains the case that only Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will decide whether the caucus moves forward with impeachment. On Friday afternoon, she called on the Trump administration to end the stonewalling on the whistleblower complaint\u2014and promised that her committees will move to get it if they do not comply. But, notably, she did not broach the topic of impeachment.\n\n\u201cReports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the President\u2019s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security,\u201d she said.\n\nThe comments sparked renewed frustration among the ranks of lawmakers worried that the failure to begin impeachment proceedings has effectively abetted more ethically-dubious activity from Trump.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still holding back,\u201d one pro-impeachment lawmaker said of Pelosi. \u201cIf impeachment isn\u2019t for this, why is impeachment in the constitution?\u201d\n\nPrivately, lawmakers put the tally on those who support impeachment at just under 140 members of the House. But that number has been steadily growing over the course of the summer even as Pelosi has said she sees no political upside in its pursuit.\n\nOne top Democratic party operative who has pushed impeachment in private briefings with lawmakers said he suspected Pelosi actually wanted to have her hand forced by her caucus. \u201cThat's why I don't think it is an act of disloyalty for Dems to put pressure on her,\u201d the person said. \u201cShe wants them to do it so it is politically safe for if she does it.\u201d\n\nOthers are doubtful that many more Democrats will move on impeachment unless or until Pelosi comes out for it. \u201cShe\u2019s the linchpin,\u201d said the House Democratic aide.\n\nA leading activist group hoping to build public support for impeachment told The Daily Beast they are talking about incorporating the whistleblower news into their pressure campaign. \u201cMy question to Democrats, Republicans, and the Speaker is, what are you waiting for?\u201d asked Kevin Mack, chief strategist for Need to Impeach.\n\nOne subject of increasing speculation on and off the Hill is whether there was an individual lawmaker of such stature that he or she could change the tenor of the impeachment debate\u2014and force Pelosi\u2019s hand\u2014by coming out for it. The parallel was made to former Rep. Jack Murtha (D-PA) coming out against the Iraq War relatively soon after it started\u2014a moment that Pelosi herself has credited with changing the tide of public opinion against the war.\n\nBut the conclusion is that few such lawmakers carry that type of weight anymore. And the names often discussed\u2014longtime civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) and former President Barack Obama\u2014would have a profound effect on fellow Democrats. But Obama is almost certain to not weigh in on the matter. And even if he did, neither he nor Lewis\u2019 impact would likely reach beyond party lines.\n\n\u201cThere just aren't those types of figures any more,\u201d the Democratic operative said.", "description": "\u201cShe\u2019s still holding back,\u201d one pro-impeachment lawmaker said of the Speaker. \u201cIf impeachment isn\u2019t for this, why is impeachment in the constitution?\u201d", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Sam Stein", "Congressional Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2045,w_3636,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569017951/GettyImages-1169286850_eo8cxo", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
