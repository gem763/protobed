Watson said city staff recognize the earlier investment, but it still doesn't make sense as a transit connection.\n\nBoth mayors are hoping the federal government will step in and help fund an estimated $10 million in work to turn the bridge into a pedestrian and cycling crossing. The bridge is currently a frequent target of trespassers and the city has spent funds to fence the entrance.\n\nLiberal candidates in the region pledged earlier in the campaign to push for the funding.\n\nThe city originally planned for a rail line to be extended across this bridge, but Watson said that plan is no longer viable.

Pedneaud-Jobin said the floods and tornadoes that have hit the region in the last few years have been a major challenge, one they can't afford to pay for out of municipal coffers.\n\nHe said the federal government also needs large cities to make real progress on climate change.\n\n\"You can't make the environment better without cities,\" he said. \"The federal government can not tackles its challenges without us.\"", "description": "The Prince of Wales Bridge will never carry trains again, the mayors of Ottawa and Gatineau declared Tuesday, asking the next federal government to help them turn it into a cycling connection instead.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4151399.1496932645!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/prince-of-wales-bridge.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
