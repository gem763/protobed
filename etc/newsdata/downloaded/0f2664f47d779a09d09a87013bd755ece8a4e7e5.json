Ltd jointly won a tender to build it, Xinhua said.\n\nState-run Import-Export Bank of China financed 85% of the project over a term of 15 years and in return the province where the farm is built had to purchase most of the materials from Chinese suppliers, Reuters has reported\n\nThe project, known as Cauchari, is a testament to the rising clout of Beijing as a backer of big projects in cash-strapped emerging markets. And it is helping China cement its standing as the world's leader in clean-energy technology.\n\n(Reporting by Chen Aizhu, editing by Louise Heavens)", "description": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese companies have built a 300-megawatt solar farm in the highlands of northern Argentina, the largest of its kind in the South American nation, China's state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png"}
