But a tour-ending injury to Oliver Gildart means Connor is likely to get the nod for this Saturday\u2019s Test match against New Zealand.\n\nIt\u2019s an opening the 25-year-old is determined to grab with both hands - and with a bit of flair thrown into the bargain.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am gutted for Oli and it\u2019s never nice for someone to go down for you to get a game. But we\u2019re all world class players and if I get the opportunity I will take it and I will be so proud to play.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nConnor made a brilliant try-scoring start to his England career in last year\u2019s 36-18 mid-season win over New Zealand in Denver. He\u2019s scored a further three tries in his four England starts since then and would love to increase his international tally in Auckland on Saturday.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf I get the opportunity to try something special I am going to try it 10 times out of 10. I like to be skilful, doing the extraordinary stuff and making things look exciting. I like to create my own playbook, my own style.\n\n\u201cThe maverick stuff comes to me really easy and I honestly don\u2019t know how. I surprised myself when I knew I could do things with the ball. It\u2019s just instinct. Everyone has got their attributes and you play as you normally play but you\u2019ve got to make sure it comes off because if not Wayne will be down your throat.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWayne Bennett has copped some flak for picking six half-backs and only one specialist centre in Gildart, who is now ruled out. But Connor, who regularly plays centre for Hull even though he prefers half-back, said the squad have complete faith in Bennett\u2019s methods.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is kind of weird trying to say why he\u2019s so good and I don't know how to explain it. I don't know if it's because you're that scared of messing up in a game. In video sessions he can be pretty brutal.\n\n\u201cBut his honesty is a good trait. You know if he gives it to you, you really don't want to mess up again.\u201d\n\nConnor started all three games against New Zealand last autumn and Kiwis coach Michael Maguire said they need to be ready for him.\n\nThe former Wigan boss said: \u201cHe is a strong player. He grabbed a couple of tries so I remember him well and truly. We will look at how we shut him down.\u201d", "description": "Hull FC utility in line for a centre spot after Oliver Gildart\u2019s tour ended by shoulder injury", "authors": ["Julie Stott", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18679112.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IMG_9533JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
