I was visiting Santa Fe, N.M., a town filled with artsy retirees, armadillo-hide cowboy boots, and yes, traditional Western toppers. For days, at specialty stores and vintage emporiums, I plopped on every hat I could find. The most compelling was a cream-colored number I spied at a western-wear shop on the south side of town\u2014a large hat with a grin-shaped brim and a lovely tobacco-colored band ringing its crown. On the shelf it looked promising but when I tried it on, I had to grapple with the fact that a bulbous cowboy-hat-shaped cheesecake had somehow landed on my head. I asked the only other customer in the store, a leathery gent in pointy boots and ripped jeans, for a second opinion. \u201cI like it,\u201d he drawled approvingly. Whatever he saw, I didn\u2019t. Sheepishly, I left the store, and Santa Fe, hatless.\n\nWhy was I craving a cowboy hat to begin with? Good old-fashioned jumping-on-the-bandwagon. While the style\u2019s comeback is still in its fledgling stages, cowboy hats are being recontextualized, adopted by young urban men who\u2019ve never inhaled the whiff of cow-pie. The hats are \u201cbecoming more of a normal thing for people to wear,\u201d said Tom Borges, 25, a photographer in Madison, Wis., who owns seven, including one custom-made by Los Angeles milliner Alexander Westwood.\n\nRonald Reagan in 1980.

You rarely see the charming country-rapper behind the megahit \u201cOld Town Road\u201d without a honking western hat on his head, from the red carpet to concert stages. Lil Nas X\u2019s viral success coincides with the \u201cYee-haw agenda,\u201d an internet phenomenon of young, mostly black, men and women celebrating cowboy culture. Other conspicuous advocates of the hat: Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller, New Jersey Devils defenseman P.K. Subban, actors Walton Goggins and Matthew McConaughey have been seen in Western hats. (True to form, country stars like Garth Brooks, Chris Stapleton and Tim McGraw remain faithful to the style as well.)\n\n\u201c \u2018One potent evangelist for the cowboy hat\u2019s revival is Lil Nas X.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAida O\u2019Toole, the owner of J.J. Hat Center in Midtown Manhattan, an area rarely traversed by Appaloosas, said she\u2019s recorded an uptick in the number of Western lids sold over the past couple of years. She likened this moment to 1980 when the release of the John Travolta vehicle \u201cUrban Cowboy\u201d inspired city-bound copycats. She credits men under 40 as the demographic most responsible for spurring the new craze-in-the-making.\n\nPrince William in 2011.

Today, some young men, unburdened by that baggage, see cowboy hats as a joyous fashion statement. Ms. O\u2019Toole noted that her customers are \u201cnot afraid to wear color\u201d or spend on ten-gallon caps ostentatiously banded with beads or dangling with add-ons.\n\nEven when not topped by some turquoise trinket, a cowboy hat \u201cis something to talk about,\u201d said Ricky Bolin, the general manager of Hat-Co, which is a licensed manufacturer of Stetson. Though John B. Stetson created the cowboy hat in 1865 as a way to \u201cprotect him from the elements,\u201d Mr. Bolin is well aware that many young men today buy the hats for looks alone. And in considerable numbers: He says that Hat-Co is currently on track to log its best sales year ever.\n\nWillie Nelson in 2018. Photo: Getty Images\n\nAnd what of my Santa Fe failure? Ms. O\u2019Toole counseled me that I may have just been trying on the wrong hats: \u201cIt\u2019s not like everyone is wearing the old J.R. hat,\u201d she said, referencing the Texas-size swoop-brimmer that J.R. Ewing wore on \u201cDallas\u201d in the 1980s. A colossal see-it-from-across-the-plains cowboy hat might work in New Mexico, where giant silver belt buckles are practically conformist. But back on the east coast, in that hat, I\u2019d look like a \u201cGunsmoke\u201d goober who got lost on the way back to the homestead.\n\nI can see why subtler, smaller-brimmed westerns, like Stetson\u2019s \u201cOpen Road\u201d model, are selling briskly. I recently tried one on in Manhattan: Unlike the satellite dish of a hat I\u2019d encountered in Santa Fe, it suited my five-foot-ten stature. It was a compact horizontal halo circling my head, blending Marlboro Man machismo with \u201cI still have to ride the subway in this thing\u201d modesty. Clearly I just had to leave the West to find the Western hat of my dreams.\n\nFOR NON-COWBOYS Five options that could work outside of Dallas.
