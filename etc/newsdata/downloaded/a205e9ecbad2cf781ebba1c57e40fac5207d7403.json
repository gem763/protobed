REUTERS/Padraic Halpin\n\nOn Tuesday, she was among about 100 expatriates who stood in the rain outside Britain\u2019s embassy in Dublin to rally against Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s planned suspension of parliament and potential \u201cno-deal\u201d exit from the European Union.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly I found myself getting so angry living in a country that was, politically at least, turning inwards, turning more right-wing,\u201d said Worsdale, 27, a Southampton native who had moved back to London two years ago after a spell in Ireland.\n\n\u201cMy partner\u2019s Irish and we just wanted to come home and it feels more like home to me. It was a fairly easy decision.\u201d\n\nWorsdale and her partner were among the almost 20,000 people who, according to data from the Central Statistics Office last week, moved from the UK to EU member Ireland in the 12 months to April 2019, as 11,600 went in the other direction.\n\nThat trend marks a sharp change in the traditional movement between the neighbouring countries and is a near exact reversal of the figures in 2013, when Ireland was emerging from a financial crisis and Britain was still a committed member of the EU.\n\nMore than 7,000 of those who immigrated from the UK in the 12 months to April 2019 were British nationals, almost double the number making the move six years ago and included Will Fenwick, who held a handmade \u2018Listen to experts\u2019 sign outside the embassy gates.\n\n\u201cI lived in England my whole life until I moved here. It\u2019s very stressful watching this unfold,\u201d said the 27-year-old analyst from Newcastle, adding the Brexit-related fall in the value of sterling meant it had never been easier to move abroad, something lots of his friends were doing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my aunt lose her job. She got laid off in the Nissan factory in Sunderland. I\u2019ve seen all the divisions this whole referendum has caused and I\u2019m looking and thinking the economic consequences of a no-deal or even a deal could be catastrophic and I just can\u2019t face that for my country.\u201d\n\nAs cries of \u2018Stop The Coup\u2019 rang out, the smattering of old and young Britons were cheered on by locals who beeped their car horns in support as they passed the short protest.\n\nLike Worsdale and Fenwick, Tim, a 63-year-old protester who declined to give his last name, said that while he may not like it, he thought Britain should leave or its exit be put to a second vote. A \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, however, was not something anyone voted for.\n\n\u201cThe heat in the argument, I don\u2019t recognise that,\u201d said the food industry worker, who left London for Dublin 22 years ago.\n\n\u201cEven amongst people I know, family, where sides have been taken. It\u2019s just very hard to square that with the Britain that I thought I came from. It seems to be broken, I\u2019m not sure how this plays out, I\u2019m at a loss. I think we all are.\u201d", "description": "Despairing at a country she believed was becoming more insular the more its Brexit debate raged, Briton Jess Worsdale decided this year that it was time to move to Ireland for good.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425898697&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821YS"}
