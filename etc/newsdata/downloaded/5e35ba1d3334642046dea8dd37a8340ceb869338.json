Could Iran's Air Force Really Take Out a Stealth Fighter?", "language": "en", "text": "Key point: Good luck finding the F-35.\n\nAmid escalating tensions between Iran and the United States, in part resulting from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision unilaterally to withdraw the United States from the 2015 deal limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the U.S. armed forces have deployed a wide array of ships, planes and other weapons to the Middle East.\n\nThe American arsenal in the region includes F-35 stealth fighters. If tensions turn into warfare, the factory-fresh F-35s could face an Iranian air force operating some of the oldest active fighters in the world.\n\nThe Iranians with their four-decade-old F-4s, F-5s and F-14s might not seem to have a chance against the Americans flying arguably the world\u2019s most advanced fighter aircraft. But history, and recent testing show how Iranian pilots flying old planes could defeat Americans flying brand-new ones.\n\nFor one, the F-35, while new, isn\u2019t necessarily a stellar aerial performer. In 2015 someone associated with the F-35 test effort leaked an official report explaining the stealth fighter\u2019s limitations in air-to-air maneuvers with an F-16.\n\n\u201cThe F-35 was at a distinct energy disadvantage,\u201d an unnamed F-35 test pilot wrote in a scathing five-page brief. \u201cInsufficient pitch rate,\u201d he added. \u201cEnergy deficit to the bandit would increase over time.\u201d\n\nThe complaints continued. \u201cThe flying qualities in the blended region (20 to 26 degrees [angle of attack]) were not intuitive or favorable,\u201d the pilot wrote, adding that there\u2019s no point for an F-35 pilot to get into a sustained, close turning battle with an enemy pilot. \u201cThere were not compelling reasons to fight in this region.\u201d\n\nThe pilot\u2019s revelations underscore what many observers long have suspected about the F-35. While its radar-evading qualities and high-end sensors might allow it to gain a favorable position for long-range missile shots, in a close fight the F-35 hardly excels.\n\nIf an Iranian pilot can survive a merge with an F-35 and engage the stealth fighter in a turning dogfight, the Iranian might just bag himself a stealth fighter. It\u2019s worth noting that the Iranian air force flies scores of fighters that excel precisely in that regime.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The American arsenal in the region includes F-35 stealth fighters.
