Regardless, they failed to present a common position,\" said Mangwana.\n\n\"The exclusion of Transnet had a legal impact on the tender which had been awarded to them as a consortium. In light of the foregoing, (the) government took a position to issue a new tender.\"\n\nDIDG chairperson Donovan Chimhanda told Reuters that the group had not been informed of the government's decision.\n\nTransnet was not immediately available to comment.\n\nNRZ was one of the single largest employers in Zimbabwe, but its fortunes waned after an economic crisis between 2000-2008 that nearly halved the southern Africa country's economy.
