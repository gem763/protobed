Lawmakers are now demanding Mr. Cummings\u2019s resignation. Protesters are waving placards with his visage, but embellished with small red horns. Rumors of his imminent firing are gaining traction in Westminster.\n\nMr. Cummings is said to be plotting a radical response, with Mr. Johnson preparing to defy the law averting a no-deal Brexit by refusing to ask Brussels for a delay, ministers said on Sunday. That could draw the courts into the dispute as the clock ticks down to Oct. 31., a spectacle that Mr. Cummings reckons will only burnish the prime minister\u2019s credibility with pro-Brexit voters far from London.\n\nBut it could also drive more moderate voters from the Conservatives for decades. And British news reports said that even Mr. Johnson was concerned that the hardball tactics have backfired.\n\nA serial provocateur, talented strategist and political assassin, Mr. Cummings has built his career on the outrage of the so-called blob, as he calls parts of the establishment. He has no known political affiliation, concentrating his energies on shaking up Britain\u2019s political system.\n\n\u201cDom has so far been very effective in running campaigns against things,\u201d said David Laws, a former lawmaker from the Liberal Democrats who worked with Mr. Cummings in the Education Department. \u201cNow we\u2019ll see whether he can make the transition into government and create things, rather than smash them up.\u201d", "description": "A serial provocateur and political assassin, Mr. Cummings is the architect of the British government\u2019s scorched-earth policy on Brexit.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller", "Stephen Castle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/world/07cummings-1/07cummings-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
