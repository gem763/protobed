In fact, she says no more often than yes, she told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\n\"I was offered a deal last week and it was great paycheck,\" she said. \"But it was with an item that I don't use in my daily life. The audience knows, you can't trick them.\"\n\nAlisha said it's not worth the money if it could damage her reputation with her audience. And she's not alone.\n\nAudiences know when a collaboration is unnatural.\n\nIf an influencer isn't using a product in their life, or doesn't believe in the brand, then it's not a good partnership, Kamiu Lee, the CEO of the influencer marketing company Activate, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It is much more impactful when the influencer is really able to articulate what about this product makes it stand out to the influencer personally versus just repeating a brand's key selling points in their content,\" Lee said.\n\nFollowers can tell when an influencer is faking their excitement, Alisha said.\n\nThat's why Alisha prefers working with brands like Starbucks, as it's a product she already uses in her daily life and her followers know that.\n\nAudience retention is a currency to creators. It's fine to promote a product, but will you be willing to give up the trust or attention because of a bad partnership?\n\n\"Obviously it's really hard when you have an actual dollar amount in your face,\" Alisha admitted, but says she often has to say no.\n\nAvoiding 'questionable digestible' products.\n\nBeyond questions of authenticity, the safety of a product is another factor influencers consider when deciding whether to do a brand partnership.\n\nAmy Neben, a partner and talent manager at Select Management Group \u2014 which manages some of YouTube's top influencers, like Eva Gutowski (mylifeaseva), with 10 million YouTube subscribers \u2014 previously told Business Insider that she advises her clients against promoting any \"questionable digestible\" product not approved by the FDA.\n\n\"They have a platform that is much more powerful than TV or film for young audiences,\" Neben said. \"We really want to make sure our clients are always thinking about that and using their influence to do good instead of the one-off paid opportunity.\"\n\nVaping products are the most rejected type of sponsorship at Select Management Group, surpassing weight-loss teas, Neben said.\n\nLook to build lasting campaigns, not one-off deals.\n\nInfluencers should look to build a lasting partnership with a company, which often looks like a yearlong campaign or a package deal with Instagram posts, video shout-outs, or tweets included in one long collaboration, Lee said.\n\n\"This is more efficient,\" Lee said. \"You don't need to learn a new brand guideline every time, and also more efficient for the brand as they won't need to recruit and brief brand new influencers every time.\"\n\nFor more on how influencers are profiting from their success online, according to industry professionals and creators, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "Alisha Marie says influencers should only be working with companies they align with and feel excited about, and other industry insiders agree.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94baba31c9690948247113?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
