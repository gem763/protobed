They then remained higher than normal for 24 hours after that.\n\nThe opposite does also happen though, with the release of Fallout 4 in 2015 resulting in a 10% drop in Pornhub traffic.\n\nFortnite returned early yesterday, as Fortnite: Chapter 2, so presumably Pornhub\u2019s searches have now fallen back to normal.\n\nAlthough we\u2019re not sure whether the biggest takeaway here is what Fortnite fans immediately think of when the game goes down or just how much statistical data Pornhub has on its visitors.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Fortnite Chapter 2 Battle Pass skins revealed as new season kicks off\n\nMORE: Fortnite Chapter 2 is live now \u2013 you can finally play Fortnite again!\n\nMORE: Fortnite down as 4.2 million watch The End and wait for Fortnite 2", "description": "With Fortnite down for several days many wondered what fans would do without the game\u2026 the answer was apparently look up porn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_3-a142_1571221794.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
