It probably worked out \u2014 even if circumstances might have appeared dire for some of the winners for quite a while.\n\nTwelve freshman QBs started over this Labor Day weekend stretch: Hank Bachmeier of Boise State; Sean Chambers of Wyoming; Matt Corral of Mississippi; Jayden Daniels of Arizona State; Brett Gabbert of Miami (Ohio); Wiley Green of Rice; Sam Howell of North Carolina; Matt Myers of Buffalo; Bo Nix of Auburn; Michael Penix Jr. of Indiana; Spencer Sanders of Oklahoma State; and Carson Strong of Nevada.\n\nNine of them won. Most impressively, five of the freshmen led winning comebacks from double-digit deficits, showing poise and resilience to go along with the requisite talent. Four of them were upset winners.\n\nIn general, quarterbacks are ready to play college football at younger ages today than ever before, and these boys-to-men showed it. The comeback kids, and how they did it:\n\nBo Nix (1), Auburn. The comeback: From down 21-6 to Oregon with 20 minutes left to a 27-21 victory.\n\nThe true freshman\u2019s numbers were not great against a quality opponent: 13-of-31 passing for 177 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions. It was Auburn\u2019s lowest-rated pass efficiency game in two years. For much of the game Nix looked like a deer trying to cross an interstate, bounding recklessly in and out of trouble.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the son of former Auburn QB Patrick Nix did it when he absolutely had to do it, leading a dramatic 60-yard touchdown drive in the final minute. Along the way he converted a fourth-and-3 with a run, a third-and-10 with a pass, and then a stunning 26-yard TD throw with nine seconds left to obviate the need for a field goal attempt.\n\n\u201cWhen the game is on the line, he found a way to win the game,\u201d Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cAnd I think that was real special for his first start.\u201d\n\nAuburn QB Bo Nix led the Tigers to a surprising comeback win over the Oregon Ducks on Saturday. (Getty)\n\nSam Howell (2), North Carolina. The comeback: From down 20-9 in the fourth quarter to South Carolina to a 24-20 victory.\n\nOne of Mack Brown\u2019s first orders of business after becoming coach of the Tar Heels last winter was flipping four-star QB Howell from a Florida State commit to UNC. (It helped Carolina\u2019s cause when FSU offensive coordinator Walt Bell left to become the head coach at Massachusetts.) That recruiting coup paid dividends in a big way Saturday against the Gamecocks in Charlotte.\n\nHowell led touchdown drives of 98 and 95 yards to pull out the victory, completing all five of his passes. He finished each drive with a touchdown pass, and added a two-point run on the first drive. \u201cI just think he really showed his chest hair,\u201d North Carolina running back Michael Carter told Tar Heel Illustrated, providing perhaps the best quote of the season to date.\n\nHank Bachmeier (3), Boise State. The comeback: From down 31-13 late in the first half to a 36-31 win at Florida State.\n\nBachmeier was no under-the-radar Boise recruiting scoop \u2014 he was a four-star California kid with plenty of Power Five offers. But the Broncos won out by offering him both a winning program and the shot at immediate playing time. Bachmeier seized that opportunity, won the starting job and then found himself starting a hurricane-relocated game in one of the storied stadiums in the sport. He also found himself knocked around, sacked five times and trailing by three scores, but never flinched.\n\nBachmeier\u2019s 407 passing yards were seventh-most in America in Week 1, and by far the most among freshman quarterbacks. On the day he led seven scoring drives of 50 yards or longer. \u201cWhat a gutsy performance for him for a first game,\u201d Boise offensive coordinator Zak Hill told the Idaho Statesman.\n\nCarson Strong (4), Nevada. The comeback: From down 31-14 late in the third quarter to a 34-31 win over Purdue.\n\nThe redshirt freshman had three yards passing after the first quarter of his first college start. He had 67 passing yards at halftime. He had 131 after three quarters. And then he unleashed a 167-yard assault in the fourth quarter alone to lead the Wolf Pack\u2019s dramatic rally, plus another 30 on the ground. Strong also punted four times for a 45-yard average, with three of them being downed inside the 20-yard line.\n\nStrong was a lightly recruited two-star prospect out of Vacaville, California, who missed his senior season due to a knee injury. He threw four passes in Nevada\u2019s opening game a year ago, then never saw the field again until Friday night. A rough start gave way to a flying finish. \u201cHe really competed,\u201d said Nevada coach Jay Norvell. \u201cHe put this team on his back and fought through at the end when we needed the will to win.\u201d\n\nSean Chambers (5), Wyoming. The comeback: From down 14-0 to Missouri in the second quarter to a 37-31 victory.\n\nNo Week 1 game turned more abruptly than this one, as Missouri went from cruising to being clobbered by 34 straight Wyoming points in a span of less than 20 minutes. The redshirt freshman Chambers contributed a team-high 120 rushing yards (including a 75-yard touchdown run), plus 92 passing yards.\n\nAfter a 2-5 start last year, Cowboys coach Craig Bohl played Chambers in four late games while still wisely preserving his redshirt year. Despite being billed a pro-style quarterback as a two-star recruit out of California, Chambers\u2019 first talent is running \u2014 he had three straight 100-yard rushing games last year against Utah State, Colorado State and San Jose State. Now he\u2019s added a fourth, in Wyoming\u2019s biggest win in years.\n\nNEXT (FRESH)MAN UP AT USC\n\nThe season-ending knee injury to USC starting quarterback JT Daniels is a potentially devastating blow. The early schedule is difficult, and this does not appear to be a team with much margin for error.\n\nThe next guy entrusted with saving Clay Helton\u2019s job is freshman Kedon Slovis (6), who played the second half against Fresno State Saturday night after Daniels went down. Slovis completed 6-of-8 passes for 57 yards with one interception, a cavalier deep throw into double coverage.\n\nHe also was put into a difficult situation by an insane Helton decision to go for a fourth-and-1 around midfield with 2:44 left and the Trojans up eight points. Any rational coach punts at that point, but Helton went for it and Slovis bobbled the snap, then was dropped for a five-yard loss. USC then had to stop a Fresno drive with an interception in the end zone to hang on.\n\nUSC quarterback Kedon Slovis (9) gestures with a \"Fight On\" sign after the Trojans' win over Fresno State. (USAT)\n\nSlovis was a three-star Rivals.com recruit out of Arizona who was not urgently sought after by most of the marquee football powers. Per Rivals, his only other Power Five offers were from North Carolina State, Oregon State and Vanderbilt. Now he\u2019s prepping to start for the Trojans against Stanford on Saturday.\n\n\"We will go ahead and get Kedon Slovis ready for the upcoming week,\u201d Helton said after announcing Daniels\u2019 injury status. \u201cWe've got all the confidence in his ability to move the offense.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll also see whether Jack Sears comes back from Transfer Portal Limbo to be part of the new USC QB equation. Sears fell to fourth on the Trojans\u2019 depth chart in August and announced late last month that he would put his name in the portal to explore his options, while tweeting that he will \u201ccontinue to train and work out and have told Coach Helton I am available if the team needs me.\u201d\n\nWell, the team may need him. Sears played just one game in 2018 when Daniels was injured and performed well, throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions in a shootout loss to Arizona State.\n\nFOUR FOR THE PLAYOFF\n\nNow that Talking Season has finally given way to Playing Season, it\u2019s time for a blank slate approach to the College Football Playoff. What happened in 2018 doesn\u2019t matter. What we projected all summer doesn\u2019t matter. We now have game data to base our judgements upon.\n\nOne game in, The Dash used the following priorities in constructing the first playoff bracket: games against Power Five opponents, and games played away from home. If your team opened against an FCS scrapper or another non-Power Five opponent, wait your turn until you\u2019ve picked on someone your own size. If you played a Power Five opponent at home, you also can line up behind those who went somewhere.\n\nIf Selection Sunday were today:\n\nPeach Bowl: No. 1 seed Auburn (7) vs. No. 4 seed Virginia (8).\n\nThe Tigers had the biggest win of the week, the aforementioned rally to beat Oregon in Arlington, Texas. Most impressive part of that victory: They held the Ducks to just seven points in the final three quarters. Defensive coordinator Kevin Steele is being paid a whopping $2 million a year, and he\u2019s earning it.\n\nThe Cavaliers went to defending ACC Coastal champion Pittsburgh on Saturday and won by 16 points, pitching a second-half shutout. Virginia didn\u2019t do a lot offensively \u2014 its 4.63 yards per play were 98th nationally \u2014 but the Cavaliers were plus-two in the turnover department and allowed just 78 rushing yards.\n\nFiesta Bowl: No, 2 seed Alabama (9) vs. No. 3 seed Georgia (10).\n\nThe Crimson Tide did what it always does to start the season, remorselessly grinding a Power Five opponent to dust on an allegedly neutral field. This time it was Duke, the score was 42-3, and the site was Atlanta. Alabama didn\u2019t perpetuate the shock-and-awe start of 2018 but was never in any danger of not winning handily. Tua Tagovailoa did his thing, producing the week\u2019s top passer rating of any quarterback playing against a Power Five team (217.5).\n\nGeorgia opened on the road for the first time since 2013, and against an SEC opponent for the first time since 1995. The Bulldogs looked the part of a title contender, rolling Vanderbilt 30-6 in Nashville. They jumped to a 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter before lapsing offensively and failing to finish drives. Georgia\u2019s defense allowed just one play from scrimmage longer than 20 yards.\n\nDropped out: Oregon.\n\nAlso considered: North Carolina, Boise State, Oklahoma State, Florida, Clemson, Cincinnati, Stanford, Boston College, Wyoming, Nevada, Hawaii.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Auburn's Bo Nix wasn't the only freshman who played like a veteran on opening weekend.
