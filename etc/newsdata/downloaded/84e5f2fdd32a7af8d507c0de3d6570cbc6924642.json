It would also require more transparency in political ads on social media such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\u201cToday Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and House Democrats are voting to gut the First Amendment and silence free speech,\u201d Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said. \"This bill is [a] pile of hot garbage that would give federal bureaucrats the power to decide what is and isn\u2019t political speech and then demand that records are kept on who says what.\"\n\n\"This bill is so blatantly un-American that it has managed to unite constitutional conservatives and ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] liberals against it,\" he added.\n\nThe ACLU said in a statement that the bill \u201cstrikes the wrong balance, sweeping too broadly and encompassing more speech than necessary to achieve its legitimate goals\u201d of preventing foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nGOP LAWMAKERS STORM CLOSED-DOOR IMPEACHMENT SESSION, AS SCHIFF WALKS OUT\n\nThe bill passed along party lines with a vote of 227 to 181, with zero Republicans voting for it.\n\nGOP leaders see the legislation as unnecessarily restrictive to campaigns. The White House threatened to strike down the bill ahead of the vote, saying it was redundant, broad and unenforceable. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be dead on arrival in the Senate.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Ca., said Republicans had already proposed a bill aimed at reducing foreign interference in U.S. elections last week. He said the House Democrats\u2019 bill would not protect against foreign meddling and also \u201cdangerously expands the federal government\u2019s control over Americans\u2019 free speech.\u201d\n\nOKLAHOMA JUDGE HALTS LAW REQUIRING DOCTORS TO INFORM PATIENTS THAT MEDICATION ABORTIONS CAN BE COUNTERACTED\n\n\u201cThe vague wording of the legislation would potentially give Washington the unprecedented responsibility of determining what qualifies as 'legitimate' news or who can be deemed a 'legitimate' journalist,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cThis partisan bill, which received zero Republican votes, will likely not see the light of day in the Senate, but it\u2019s a reminder of the lengths Democrats will go to suppress competing speech,\u201d he added.\n\nThe bill was introduced over the summer during the height of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The probe established political connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, but it did not find a conspiracy between the two. The House's approval of the bill comes amid Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump, who is accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine unless it investigated former Vice President and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe election security legislation is the third such bill that the Democrat-led House has passed relating to issues that arose from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn March, the House approved a bill aimed at making it easier for people to register to vote, tightening election security and requiring presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns. The Senate has yet to vote on the bill.\n\nIn June, the House approved a bill requiring paper ballots in federal elections and authorized $775 million to help states secure their election systems. However, Senate Republicans vetoed that and other election security legislation this week, and showed no signs of stopping their efforts to block Democrats' legislation.\n\nRepublicans said Wednesday\u2019s bill amounted to a federal takeover of elections and could cost billions of dollars. McConnell declined to bring up a stand-alone bill on election security, but said he would support an effort to send $250 million in election security funds to states to bolster their election systems ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Republican lawmakers slammed what they called a \u201cpile of hot garbage\u201d election security bill that passed in the House of Representatives\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0saying that it violated free speech", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Sasse-McCarthy_AP-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
