But as a professional footballer, I have to respect the decision of the coach. Not being involved, watching from home, makes me feel helpless.\n\n\u201cI want to be part of the side, I want to support my team-mates to succeed.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I\u2019m not training all the time just for the sake of it, I\u2019m ready to play.\n\n\"This should not be about me or the coach, only the club. I have to give everything, be fit and focused, and I\u2019m training hard to be ready.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOzil insists he came into the season in form, and has been \"fully available\" for Emery.\n\n\u201cPre-season went very well and although things were disrupted by the [moped] attack, since then I\u2019ve been fully available and when the coach has selected me I\u2019ve been ready, played and always tried to give my best.\" he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve trained at the same level my whole career but because I\u2019ve not had minutes recently, I\u2019m doing extra work with the fitness coach and in the gym to get even fitter than normal.\n\n\"I know what is needed and believe in myself.\u201d", "description": "The German has only featured in one Premier League game so far in 2019/20", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18297057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chelsea-v-Arsenal-UEFA-Europa-League-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
