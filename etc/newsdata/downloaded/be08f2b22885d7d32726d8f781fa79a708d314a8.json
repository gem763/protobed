They're the orange boxes below each of those storage towers of products. Ben Gilbert/Business Insider\n\nIt's impossible to see in a still image, of course, but you'll have to take my word for it: The robot ballet, seen above, is mesmerizing.\n\nSome evidence of what's happening can be seen on the floor, where their dance moves are laid bare in a series of geometrically perfect tracks. After so many turns around the floor since this facility opened in late September 2018, the marks on the floor are evidence of the work they've been doing: hauling hundreds of pounds of products here and there, in an endless series of calculations involving an array of constantly shifting factors.\n\nSimply speaking, these robots serve as the product categorization system for the entire facility.\n\nEach of the compartments in the yellow stack holds various products that have been inventoried and stored by a person in stowing, and each stack can weigh up to 1,500 pounds in total per robot. When a customer orders an item, the whole stack is brought to another person who removes the item from its holding place and ships it to your home.\n\nNow multiply that series of actions by millions of people ordering millions of different things that are all going millions of different places, and you get the complex dance of robots above.\n\nIt's a system known within Amazon as \"random stow,\" and it's been in place for years \u2014 but now it's automated.", "description": "Amazon's fulfillment centers are known for being big, and the first one in New York City is no exception \u2014\u00a0but that's not what impressed me most.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6eb1352e22af031e04bd46-2732-1366.jpg"}
