Noting that major-country relationships are the key to the future development of the world landscape because they represent the main strategic powers of the world, Zhou said the China-United States relationship is tied to world peace, stability and development.\n\nA consensus appearing in the latest round of discussions between Beijing and Washington over trade frictions has eased concerns somewhat in the international community, which demonstrates that the two countries properly dealing with disagreements not only helps themselves but also benefits the whole world, Zhou added.\n\nMladen Ivanic, former prime minister of Republic of Srpska, said economic globalization and the multilateral trading system are being challenged amid a changing international situation. He hailed China's important role in upholding multilateralism and said the Belt and Road Initiative is significant to the countries and regions involved.\n\nZhang Junkuo, vice-minister of Development Research Center of the State Council, said that although the existing global trading rules need improving, the trend of economic globalization is irresistible.\n\nAround 500 scholars, academicians and researchers from China and abroad attended the forum.", "description": "Joint efforts are needed from all countries to promote an open economy worldwide and stimulate sluggish global growth, as unilateralism and protectionism continue to vex the world, experts said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db5d97aa310cf3e97a31ed7.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
