Whether he had an uncomfortable moment is what it is.\"\n\nFred Herzog would wander the streets, capturing scenes of the gritty city on Kodachrome slide film. (Fred Herzog, Crossing Powell, 1984, Archival pigment print, Courtesy of Equinox Gallery. )\n\nSylvester said those comments haven't tarnished the photographer's artistic legacy, as far as he is concerned.\n\n\"I know him and I know his work and his work continues to be admired by collectors, by museums and by all sorts of people around the world,\" he said.\n\nHerzog was born in Germany in 1933 and came to Vancouver in 1953.\n\nHe is survived by his daughter Ariane and son Tyson and was predeceased by his wife Christel, who passed away in 2013.", "description": "Renowned photographer Fred Herzog\u00a0died in Vancouver Monday at the age of 88.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278748.1568174340!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fred-herzog-curtains.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
