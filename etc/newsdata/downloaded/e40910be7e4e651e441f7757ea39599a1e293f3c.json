The crowds that are coming out are enormous...and people want to see action. The United States government supports their call for action for reform for fighting corruption,\u201d the official told reporters. \u201cThis is not a new problem. The economic crisis that Lebanon is currently facing was a slow train coming.\u201d\n\nFlag-waving protesters kept roads blocked with vehicles and makeshift barricades for a seventh day on Wednesday. Banks have been closed since Friday and will remain shut on Thursday, the banking association said. Schools are also closed.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri\u2019s government announced an emergency reform package on Monday to try to assuage public anger and steer the state away from a looming financial crisis.\n\nWashington was in routine contact with their Lebanese counterparts but was not up to the United States to tell Beirut what to do, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the Lebanese people will accept what\u2019s been tabled,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been talking with them about reform for a very long time.\u201d\n\nSources said Lebanese leaders are discussing a possible government reshuffle to defuse the protests. Lebanon\u2019s highest Christian Maronite authority and a prominent Druze politician threw their weight behind the groundswell for change, calling for qualified technocrats to be included in any government shake-up.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the French government urged Beirut to carry out the reforms, which are key to unlocking some $11 billion in financing pledged by France and other countries and lending institutions last year.\n\nThe official said Washington saw the announcement of the emergency reforms but they needed to be put in action for the financial package to be rolled out. \u201cFunds will be released when these reforms are enacted and implemented,\u201d he said.", "description": "Lebanese people are \"rightfully angered\" with their government over its refusal to tackle corruption and Washington supports their right to demonstrate peacefully, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Humeyra Pamuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
