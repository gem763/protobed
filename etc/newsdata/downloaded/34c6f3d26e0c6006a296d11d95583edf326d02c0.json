Though there have been other dual-threat quarterbacks who mirrored Vick in the past, none have done it quite as well as Jackson has thus far in his young career.\n\nYesterday was just the latest example, as Jackson threw for 143 passing yards while nabbing 116 rushing yards, stats which earned the 22-year-old his fourth double-triple (at least 100 yards in two different statistical categories in the same game) of his young career.\n\nWith four double-triples already, Jackson is now tied with Russell Wilson \u2014 who hasn\u2019t had a 100-yard rushing game since 2014 \u2014 for second on the NFL\u2019s all-time list. In first place for quarterbacks with eight double-triples? Vick.\n\nBut while Vick was able compiled that number over 143 games spread out over a 13-year career, Jackson has been able to do it in just 23 games (with only 14 starts). It\u2019s difficult to do a statistical comparison between the two since the sample size for Jackson is so small but, up to this point, he\u2019s actually fared a bit better than Vick did over the same period.\n\nThough Jackson is averaging fewer yards passing than Vick during his first two seasons, he\u2019s rushing for more yards per game, being sacked and intercepted less, and rushing and throwing for virtually the same number of touchdowns. Jackson\u2019s record over his first 14 games as a starter (11-3) is also better than Vick\u2019s was (8-5-1), as is his completion percentage (61 percent compared to 51.6 percent).\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that those stats take into account last season, when Jackson took over for Joe Flacco halfway through the season; the picture gets even rosier for Jackson if you just look at what he\u2019s done on a per-game basis in his second year, and his first as the locked-in starter.\n\nTo be fair to Vick, the passer-friendly era Jackson plays in certainly has to be taken into account when comparing the two, though it shouldn\u2019t swing the argument back in his favor. This year, Jackson has been an above-average passer in yards, touchdowns and passer rating. As SB Nation points out, Vick didn\u2019t make it into the top half of the league in any of those stats until his sixth season in the NFL, when he was 10th in touchdown passes in 2006.\n\nEven Vick himself once said of Jackson, \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous man behind center \u2026 He\u2019s going to be hard to deal with for a long time.\u201d\n\nBased on Jackson\u2019s number thus far, that prediction appears to be right on the money.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "There have been other dual-threat quarterbacks who have somewhat mirrored Vick in the past, but none have done it quite as well as Jackson has so far.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182323403-e1571672795839.jpg?fit=888%2C591", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
