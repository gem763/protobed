Smith on Twitter", "language": "en", "text": "When New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees was sidelined with a thumb injury in Week 2, ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith \u2014 like always \u2014 had a take.\n\n\u201cThe Saints are done without Drew Brees. Period,\u201d Smith said at the time on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take.\u201d\n\nHowever that take, like many of Smith\u2019s, didn\u2019t quite pan out.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nThe Saints have won five straight games without their future Hall of Fame quarterback, and appear to have had little trouble doing it, too. New Orleans knocked off the Seattle Seahawks and handed the Dallas Cowboys their first loss of the season, and then grabbed wins against Tampa Bay and Jacksonville before Sunday\u2019s dominant 36-25 victory against the Chicago Bears \u2014 which they did without running back Alvin Kamara.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater has looked solid in Brees\u2019 absence, too, compiling nearly 1,100 yards with seven touchdowns while completing nearly 70 percent of his passes. He went 23 of 38 for 281 yards and had two touchdowns on Sunday, too. Most importantly, though, Bridgewater has kept the Saints winning.\n\nSo, following the win at Soldier Field on Sunday, the Saints decided to troll Smith on Twitter in perhaps the best way possible: sith Michael Scott.\n\nBetter luck next time, Stephen A.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With a little help from Michael Scott, the Saints fired back at the iconic ESPN personality on Sunday after their win in Chicago.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sxuZA9ZiVxSs6Q6pe0_aSw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTAuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jmNGqs0bdXtUdbScTpKkAA--~B/aD0yNzU5O3c9NDE1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ea3cf2c0-f3af-11e9-bff7-27bc0188666d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
