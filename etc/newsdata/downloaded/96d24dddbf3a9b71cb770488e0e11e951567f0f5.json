They also want records of discussions those individuals had concerning the substance of the calls.\n\nA bevy of current and former National Security Council officials, including fired national security adviser John Bolton, are referenced in the subpoena request, as is Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the senior U.S. official attending Zelensky\u2019s inauguration. Prominently featured as well are Attorney General Bill Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and their subordinates. Pompeo, who on Tuesday signaled defiance of a previous House subpoena for testimony from State officials, admitted in Rome on Wednesday that he was on the July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\nThe latest subpoena request came hours before another headache for Pompeo. The State Department\u2019s inspector general will brief House leaders about an ostensibly urgent matter seemingly related to Ukraine. Following that, on Thursday, the Ukraine special envoy Pompeo fired, Kurt Volker, does the same. Next week, so will cashiered U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nWhile House Democratic leaders have sought to narrow their impeachment focus to the Trump-Zelensky exchange, the new subpoena request opened the aperture somewhat. It seeks documentation of communications between Trump \u201cand the leader of any other foreign country\u201d relevant to \u201cpursuing investigations of President Trump\u2019s political rivals and Ukrainian foreign aid.\u201d That move came after reports that Trump sought to enlist his new U.K. counterpart, Boris Johnson, in discrediting Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference in 2016. Trump reportedly did the same with Australian PM Scott Morrison.\n\nThey\u2019re also seeking records of any effort by Trump or subordinates to \u201cidentify or retaliate against\u201d the anonymous whistleblower who, having learned of Trump pressuring Zelensky into the Biden inquiry, reported it to the intelligence-community inspector general. Trump has demanded the release of the whistleblower\u2019s identity, a violation of federal whistleblower protection laws, and publicly suggested violence against the whistleblower\u2019s sources.\n\nPresidencies typically consider internal White House communications to be privileged documents outside the reach of Congress. Schiff, at a Wednesday press conference with Pelosi, reiterated a Democratic position that noncompliance will \u201cbe considered evidence of obstruction.\u201d While the Democratic leadership wants the impeachment inquiry to move quickly, Schiff signaled the party\u2019s willingness \u201cto litigate\u201d if necessary to compel disclosure.\n\nPelosi, who resisted impeachment hearings until news of the Zelensky call emerged, used solemn tones to describe the impeachment proceedings. She pledged they would be fair, dignified, and provide Trump with opportunities to make his case.", "description": "If Trump and his senior officials don\u2019t comply, House Dems said they were willing to \u201clitigate\u201d in their impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2262,w_4022,x_0,y_47/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570036434/RTX75RC5_mmc2d3"}
