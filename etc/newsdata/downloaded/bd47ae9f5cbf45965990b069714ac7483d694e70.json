The same goes for your business.\n\nEnergy suppliers tend to cash in on busy business owners who don\u2019t have the time to arrange a new deal, and comparing business energy deals can be a painstaking process.\n\nUnlike domestic energy tariffs, you can't compare and switch online for business energy rates. Either you need to contact a business supplier directly - though the number of these is limited compared to domestic suppliers - or you can use a broker to do this for you.\n\nBrokers include uSwitch for Business, Energy Helpline Business or Make it Cheaper, the latter of which we have partnered with to help you find the best deal for your business.\n\nEnergy suppliers tend to cash in on busy business owners who don\u2019t have the time to switch\n\nAs such there is no such thing as a 'best buy' table for business deals in the same way there is for domestic plans. Contracts have to be tailored to meet the exact needs of each individual business, and the amount it costs depends on what type of contract it is on, how much it uses, the fuels it uses and the type of meter it has among other factors.\n\nuSwitch energy expert Rik Smith said: 'Switching energy deals for your business isn't quite the same as choosing a tariff for your home, but the same principle applies: don't pay more than you need to.\n\n'You can check for better deals either by contacting your business energy supplier directly, or by using a broker.'\n\nShould I go direct or use an energy broker?\n\nGoing directly to business energy suppliers can be extremely time-consuming, as you need to contact each one, give particular details about your business, and do this twice per supplier - once for gas and once for electricity.\n\nBusiness energy brokers can do all the heavy work for you though this comes at a cost as they are specialised intermediaries who work with both the business energy consumers and the energy suppliers.\n\nSmith continued: 'Brokers will be able to contact a range of suppliers on your behalf, based on the type of business you are and how much you use, and advise you on the most appropriate type of contract for your circumstances - saving you the time and hassle of doing it all yourself.'\n\nEnergy brokers charge customers in a few different ways; the most common method being a commission, but also via a share of the savings up front.\n\nVia the commission method, a broker will contact suppliers and request prices that include his or her commission per kWh.\n\nThe kWh unit rate the consumer sees includes this commission, and the broker invoices the supplier directly based on the consumption of the consumer.\n\nSmith warns: 'Because the commission is paid via the supplier, it is common for businesses to think that their broker works for free. This is not the case, so be sure to find out what your broker\u2019s commission rate is.\n\n'It\u2019s also a good idea to check that the broker works with both large and small suppliers to find the best business energy deals.'\n\nChoosing a business energy supplier\n\nWhether you're applying for your first business energy tariff or switching, the two prices you need to focus on when comparing quotes are the unit cost and standing charge.\n\nThe unit cost is the price you pay per unit of energy (kWh) and the standing charge is a daily charge that helps with the maintenance of the national grid and the cost of transporting energy direct to your business.\n\nBusiness energy suppliers British Gas business Contract Natural Gas (CNG) Corona Energy DONG Energy Dual Energy EDF Energy E.ON Gazprom Haven Power Npower for Business Opus Energy Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) ScottishPower Source: uSwitch\n\nThese contracts have a fixed price on the per unit (kWh) cost for the duration of the contract. The total you pay per month will still vary as this depends on how much energy you use - the cost per unit however, will not.\n\nOn variable business energy rate contracts the cost per unit will vary throughout the duration. This will often be linked to market activity, so when demand is high, the cost per unit goes up - and vice versa.\n\nIf you're looking to switch your business energy supplier, it's important to track down your current contract to familiarise yourself with your current rates and usage.\n\nYou can start comparing and arranging a switch up to six months before your contract ends which will give you time to review different plans on the market and take time choosing the right one for your business.\n\nIf you failed to give your supplier adequate notice of your plans to move to a different supplier, then they will rollover your contract, automatically putting you on a more expensive rate.\n\nThis will be either a deemed rate (an out-of-contract rate tariff) from which you can switch at any time, or a rollover rate (a contract that is used when no alternative has been agreed before your current contract\u2019s end date) which you won't be able to get out of as easily.\n\nYou\u2019ll not be able to compare prices and switch until it enters its renewal window, which is usually between one and six months before the end date.\n\nA 28-day contract is for businesses that haven\u2019t switched since the energy market was deregulated.\n\nThere is no 'best buy' list of business energy suppliers as such because each contact is tailor-made to each individual business. However, the tables below show the average energy prices depending on consumption.\n\nElectricity Consumption (kWh) Average standing charge Average unit rate Average annual spend 0 - 19999 \u00a30.312 \u00a30.1645 \u00a31,698.07 20000 -39999 \u00a30.290 \u00a30.1576 \u00a34,816.64 40000- 60000 \u00a30.290 \u00a30.1553 \u00a37,850.72 Source: Make it Cheaper as at 18 July 2019\n\nGas Consumption (kWh) Average standing charge Average unit rate Average annual spend 0 - 19999 \u00a30.233 \u00a30.0511 \u00a3570.49 20000 -39999 \u00a30.225 \u00a30.0455 \u00a31,445.80 40000- 59999 \u00a30.253 \u00a30.0426 \u00a32,217.44 60000 - 80000 \u00a30.296 \u00a30.0408 \u00a32,964.38 Source: Make it Cheaper as at 18 July 2019\n\nOnce you've made the decision to switch - be that before your current contract ends or while you're on a deemed tariff, you'll then have to consider what kind of tariff you want to move onto.\n\nA fixed term contract has a fixed price on the per unit (kWh) cost for the duration of the contract. The total you pay per month will still vary as this depends on how much energy you use - the cost per unit will not vary though.\n\nOn variable business energy rate contracts the cost per unit will vary throughout the duration, and will often be linked to market activity, such as when demand is high the cost per unit goes up, and vice versa.\n\nIf you are not the business owner, you will also need the permission of the owner to take responsibility of the contract change. You will simply need to confirm that you have this authority at the time of switching.\n\nSwitch your business' energy bills One phone call to our business energy experts is all it takes to compare tariffs from a range of suppliers, and switch to a deal that better suits the needs and budget of your business.
