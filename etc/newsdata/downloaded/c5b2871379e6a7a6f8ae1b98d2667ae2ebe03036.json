Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, the government is only obliged to allow time in the Commons for a no confidence motion if brought about by the leader of the Opposition.\n\nMr Johnson said that opposition parties should have the \u201ccourage\u201d to table a no confidence vote to remove him from office, adding: \u201cThis parliament must either stand aside and let this government get Brexit done, or bring a vote of confidence and finally face the day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson could face a vote of no confidence in the coming days, the SNP have warned as they aim to replace his government with a temporary administration to secure a Brexit extension.
