Gee, it was a great game,\u201d Proudfoot told reporters on Wednesday of what he thought of the England side\u2019s semi-final performance.\n\n\u201cWe ... were impressed with their game.\u201d\n\nProudfoot, who has been involved with the Springboks since 2016, indicated England\u2019s forwards\u2019 performance against the All Blacks was a combination of the sharp edge of a rapier with a slashing claymore.\n\n\u201cThey were very powerful (but) it wasn\u2019t just brute force, there was very intelligent play from their pack,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUp front they\u2019re a lot more confident in what they\u2019re doing. They understand what they want to do.\n\n\u201cMitch (John Mitchell) has added more detail on their defence, particularly around what they do at the tackle.\n\n\u201cThey have become far more efficient in what they do, in terms of their efficiency of execution, it\u2019s a lot better.\n\n\u201cThat is what we need to match. It will be a tough game.\u201d\n\nProudfoot, however, was equally equivocal his own pack, designed for clubbing opposition sides into submission, would be able to match the power of Eddie Jones\u2019s side.\n\nThe forwards now had a lot of experience from numbers one to eight, as well as off the bench, with several already exceeding 50 caps each, while Tendai Mtawarira had more than 100, Proudfoot added.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys have been there and done that ... and our coaching philosophy is to empower these guys to handle the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has impressed me is how ... they solve their problems.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks team was also well aware of what they could possibly achieve if they win their country\u2019s third Rugby World Cup title, having won in 1995 and 2007.\n\nRugby Union - Rugby World Cup - England Training - Fuchu Asahi Football Park, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan - October 29, 2019 England's George Ford and Elliot Daly during training REUTERS/Matthew Childs\n\n\u201cI think South Africa as a country has got a lot of challenges,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) it\u2019s a country with a hell of a lot of pride in their national team.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a player become a Springbok, they change. They take what it means to them to the country. There is a real connection between the Springbok player and what it means to be a Springbok and the supporter back home.\n\n\u201cEveryone involved in this, we understand it is a final. I suppose the side that does what they do better will be the more successful team.\u201d", "description": "South Africa forwards coach Matt Proudfoot had a similar reaction to the rest of the rugby world watching England destroy New Zealand in the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup last week - open-mouthed awe.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446418500&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T09G", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
