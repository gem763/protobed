The listed entities include Chinese state security bureaus, as well as the eight companies.\n\nThose companies include Hikvision and Dahua Technology, massive international purveyors of video surveillance cameras. Also included on the list was SenseTime, a Chinese AI startup, and speech recognition company iFlytek.\n\nThe filing did not detail the allegations apart from saying they were \u201cactivities contrary to the foreign policy of the United States,\u201d but China is known to have launched a high-tech surveillance apparatus to monitor and imprison minority groups in Xinjian.\n\nThe move is the latest US policy crackdown on Chinese businesses. Most prominently, the US blacklisted Huawei over security concerns earlier this year, a decision the company has pushed back against. Meanwhile, the US is continuing to pursue a trade deal with China, while President Trump has suggested that Huawei\u2019s status could be considered in the discussions.", "description": "The United States is adding eight Chinese technology companies to its trading blacklist, barring some major producers of surveillance equipment from working with American companies.", "authors": ["Colin Lecher", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4PKmx6EE5ZOPYwqHFjyC8nGGkY=/0x322:4500x2678/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19268080/1145806285.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
