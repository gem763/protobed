Results from Israel's three major TV stations showed challenger Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White party slightly ahead of Likud. But as CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reports, exit polls are often imprecise, and the final tally, expected later Wednesday, could shift in Netanyahu's favor.\n\nVoting is just the first stage; now Doane says the back-room deal making will begin. Neither party will control a parliamentary majority without backing from Avigdor Lieberman, who could bring his midsize Yisrael Beitenu party into a coalition.\n\nResults in Israel too close to call after polls close\n\nThis is far from the first time Netanyahu has faced a political setback. In May, Israel held its second snap election of 2019 after Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition and instead dissolved parliament. In that case, Netanyahu wasn't able to form a parliamentary majority because Lieberman refused to join a coalition with Likud.\n\nNetanyahu is also battling right now for more than his political survival; he's facing possible indictment on corruption charges, and wants a parliament that will approve legislation granting him immunity from prosecution.", "description": "With nearly all of the votes counted, Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger appear tied", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/1dbf67fd-4fe5-4e3a-aef6-c0a62d2af6b7/thumbnail/1200x630/cbd07ed3a6303f24b8ae64b97b015d62/trump-netanyahu-broll-rem34-frame-3096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
