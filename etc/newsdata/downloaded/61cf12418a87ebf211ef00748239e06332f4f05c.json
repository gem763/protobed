By removing her as ambassador based on false claims and a desire to pursue dubious conspiracy theories, President Trump and his enablers had broken a \u201csacred trust\u201d \u2014 namely that the U.S. government will have the backs of its diplomats serving overseas and protect them from attacks by foreign interests.\n\n\u201cThat basic understanding no longer holds true. Today we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d Yovanovitch said in her prepared statement. The great harm, she noted, will come when \u201cprivate interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain,\u201d and when bad actors in countries around the world \u201csee how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system. In such circumstances, the only interests that will be served are those of our strategic adversaries, like Russia, that spread chaos and attack [our] institutions.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s outrage is understandable, and the damage to American diplomacy may last for years. But it may be easier to repair than the disruption in relations between U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies and their counterparts in allied countries. Ambassadors serve at the president\u2019s pleasure, and relations with other states are subject to any administration\u2019s foreign-policy priorities and political needs. But at the professional, bureaucratic level, the sharing of information among law enforcement and intelligence agencies, founded on mutual trust built up over decades, is meant to be permanent and above politics. And the Trump administration seems indifferent to that pact of nonpartisanship among professionals, if not actively hostile.\n\nIn the phone call at the center of the House impeachment inquiry, Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and advanced several conspiracy theories that cast doubt on former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The president also directly implicates Attorney General William Barr in the campaign.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine,\u201d Trump says, referencing a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was actually behind the hacking of the emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee in 2016, and that Clinton\u2019s private server has been hidden in Ukraine. \u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhile the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry to date has focused largely on the overseas activities of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and State Department officials, it is the close involvement of Attorney General Barr that many intelligence experts find far more troubling. Barr has traveled overseas and reached out to several closely allied countries seeking help in the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of another conspiracy theory favored by Trump, this one positing that the Russia probe had corrupt origins and was a set-up job perpetrated by a cabal of \u201cdeep state\u201d intelligence operatives to deny Trump the presidency.\n\nThose advancing this theory have failed to explain why, if that was the plan dating back to long before the election, most of the findings of Russian interference became public only after Trump had won.\n\nThe very fact that the top law enforcement official in the nation is personally involved in an outside-normal-channels outreach to allied nations in order to substantiate a largely debunked conspiracy theory could potentially damage critical U.S. intelligence relationships worldwide.\n\n\u201cGetting ensnared in another country\u2019s domestic political dispute is heresy for an intelligence agency, especially when that country is the United States and the most important intelligence partner for all our allies,\u201d said Paul Pillar, who spent 28 years at the CIA, including stints as executive assistant to the director of central intelligence and deputy director of the agency\u2019s counterterrorism center. \u201cNow along comes Attorney General Barr as America\u2019s senior law enforcement official trying to dig up dirt overseas to serve the president\u2019s domestic political purposes. That\u2019s not only highly objectionable, it\u2019s outrageous.\u201d", "description": "The effort by President Trump and his attorney general to enlist foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies in their smear of Joe Biden may do lasting damage to relationships with their counterparts in other countries and the critical \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence-sharing agreement.", "authors": ["James Kitfield"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3grTY3z07yu0KVlPfj_vAQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/22198330-ef45-11e9-97f7-3e00f42833ce", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
