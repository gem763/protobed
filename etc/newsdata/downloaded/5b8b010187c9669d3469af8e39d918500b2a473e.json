Khashoggi, long a royal court insider, had been in self-imposed exile in the U.S. while writing critically of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, son of the oil-rich nation\u2019s King Salman.\n\nWhile the crown prince recently told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d he did not order the writer\u2019s killing, U.S. lawmakers and U.N. investigator Agnes Callamard laid the blame for the slaying on the prince. For its part, Saudi Arabia says it is trying 11 people for the killing but few details about the case have been released.\n\nCallamard spared no criticism of the Saudi royal.\n\n\u201cA \u2018responsible\u2019 Statesman should not have tolerated 12 months of disinformation and 12 months continuing policies of intolerance and repression that led to Mr Khashoggi murder,\u201d Callamard wrote on Twitter.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe Crown Prince takes great pains to distance himself from the killing, creating layers after layers of officials and institutions between himself and the execution of Mr #Khashoggi, suggesting they are acting like a buffer. They are not. The identity of the killers and planners point to a far closer relationship between them and him than he is prepared to admit.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Saudi Arabia to Callamard\u2019s comments, though the kingdom rejected her exhaustive report on the case by alleging it contained unexplained \u201cprejudice and bias.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, 59, was a longtime royal court insider and editor in state-linked newspapers in Saudi Arabia. As a journalist, he covered the mujahideen fighters who fought the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and later offered commentary on the 2011 Arab Spring.\n\nBut he described himself as worried by the rise of Prince Mohammed. He privately described the young prince in a text message to a friend as \u201ca beast Pac-Man, the more victims he eats, the more he wants,\u201d according to the U.N. report by Callamard.\n\nBut even in his columns for the Post, which the newspaper often translated into Arabic, Khashoggi kept up the criticism, noting the arrests of women\u2019s rights activists even as Prince Mohammed and his father granted women the right to drive.\n\n\u201cWe are being asked to abandon any hope of political freedom, and to keep quiet about arrests and travel bans that impact not only the critics but also their families,\u201d Khashoggi wrote.\n\nNeeding paperwork to get married, Khashoggi was asked to return to the Saudi Consulate on Oct. 2, 2018. There, a team of Saudi intelligence officers and a forensic scientist trained in autopsy work waited for him. When he arrived, one officer referred to him as \u201cthe sacrificial animal,\u201d the U.N. report said.\n\nCallamard\u2019s report relied on surveillance recordings apparently made by Turkish spies who monitored the consulate. During the days before Saudi Arabia acknowledged Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Turkish authorities routinely leaked details of the writer\u2019s slaying to local media.\n\n\u201cThe 15-member assassination squad that murdered Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia\u2019s Consulate in Istanbul and chopped his body into pieces served the interests of a shadow state within the kingdom\u2019s government - not the Saudi state or people,\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wrote in a column last weekend in the Post.\n\nHowever, critics have noted the role geopolitics has played in the case - Turkey views itself as a rival to Saudi Arabia in the Muslim world while Erdogan\u2019s government has been the world\u2019s worst jailer of journalists in recent years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar\u2019s government-funded Al-Jazeera satellite news network has offered almost nonstop coverage of the killing amid a four-nation boycott of Doha led by Riyadh.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s killing pushed U.S. lawmakers away from Saudi Arabia, with President Donald Trump, who took his first overseas trip to the kingdom, even saying at one point that it involved a \u201ccover-up that was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad deal - should have never been thought of, somebody really messed up,\u201d Trump said three weeks after the columnists\u2019 death. \u201cWhoever thought of that idea is in big trouble - and they should be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nTrump, however, declined to stop arms deals to Saudi Arabia and floated the idea that the slaying was a \u201crogue\u201d operation even before the kingdom began offering that as an explanation.\n\nPrince Mohammed, speaking to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in an interview aired on Sunday, repeatedly denied he was involved, though any major decision in the autocratic kingdom comes from its rulers.\n\n\u201cWhen a crime is committed against a Saudi citizen by officials, working for the Saudi government, as a leader I must take responsibility,\u201d the crown prince said. \u201cThis was a mistake. And I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.\u201d\n\nImmediately after Saudi Arabia acknowledged Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Prince Mohammed was shown on Saudi state media shaking hands with the writer\u2019s son, Salah Khashoggi.\n\nOn Tuesday, Salah wrote on Twitter that he had \u201cfull confidence in the kingdom\u2019s court in achieving justice for those who have murdered my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe enemies of our nation and his enemies in the East and West used his case to take advantage of my nation and leadership,\u201d Salah wrote.\n\nHe added: \u201cI will remain like Jamal Khashoggi loyal to my nation and its leadership.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year drew renewed scrutiny Tuesday to the kingdom, as his son and a U.N. investigator spoke out ahead of the anniversary of his death.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jon Gambrell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/saudi_writer_killed_18174_c0-167-4000-2499_s1770x1032.jpg?0ff70703b128ca503aced402a7d61935364c4e5a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
