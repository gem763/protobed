I have good reason to believe my income is going to increase significantly soon.\n\nWesley\n\nDear Wesley,\n\nThe purpose of life insurance is to take care of your family if something unexpected happens to you. You don\u2019t want to buy too much, but you should have enough to ensure that they\u2019re well taken care of when you\u2019re not here any longer.\n\nI usually recommend people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in a good, level term life insurance policy. However, if you have a solid reason to believe your income will be jumping significantly soon, there\u2019s nothing wrong with basing your coverage amount on that figure\u2014if you can afford it, of course.\n\nUnderstand that when I say, \u201csolid reason,\u201d I\u2019m not talking about a hopeful attitude. I\u2019m talking about something along the lines of finishing a medical residency, then making the jump to a six-figure income.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of logical thinking and planning I\u2019m working with here. In that scenario, or something similar, a huge jump in income is virtually assured.\n\nGreat question, Wesley!\n\n\u2014Dave\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nDear Dave,\n\nMy husband and I are wondering if we need term life insurance policies. We both have accidental death and dismemberment coverage provided free of charge through our employers. Do we need additional coverage?\n\nRebecca\n\nYou should always have life insurance coverage that\u2019s separate from anything an employer may offer. - Money expert Dave Ramsey\n\nDear Rebecca,\n\nYes, you both need to find good level term life insurance immediately! Accidental death and dismemberment policies are nothing but gimmicks. You need to make sure your family is taken care of in the very best way possible, no matter how you die.\n\nYou should always have life insurance coverage that\u2019s separate from anything an employer may offer. Think about it. You don\u2019t want to suddenly lose coverage if you change jobs, or have to leave your place of work because you\u2019re diagnosed with a major medical condition.\n\nBoth of you need 10 to 12 times your yearly incomes in good, level term life insurance. If you make $50,000 a year, that means you need $500,000 to $600,000 in coverage.\n\nRemember, the idea of life insurance is to take the place of income. If one of you died, the other could invest the insurance money, make 10 percent on that money over time with good mutual funds, and replace any lost income.\n\nTerm life insurance is very affordable. For just a few dollars a month you can leave your loved ones in great financial shape after you die!\n\n\u2014Dave\n\nDave Ramsey is CEO of Ramsey Solutions.
