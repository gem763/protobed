So you may need to go to a second, third or fourth page to find the best products and services available to you,\" she said, questioning whether the consumer is always getting the most accurate information.\n\nHUNDREDS OF GOOGLE EMPLOYEES SAY THEY REFUSE TO WORK WITH IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ON CLOUD-COMPUTING WORK\n\nAs the mother of a 13-month-old daughter, Rutledge said she has mothers and fathers in mind, explaining that many young parents will use Google to search for medical information or advice when their child is sick.\n\n\"I want to make sure every mom, every dad ... are getting the most accurate information possible and not simply the doctor or clinic who has paid the most in digital advertising.\"\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the Internet that it's fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.\n\n\"Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\" a Google spokesperson told Fox News in an emailed statement last week. \"We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"\n\nFox News Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said on Tuesday that Google\u2019s \u201cincredible amount of power\u201d subjects it to an investigation of a possible antitrust violation.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/arkansas-google.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
