He is the most senior official to depart as the airline maker struggles to contain the crisis following the crashes of two 737 Max jets that killed 346 people.\n\nThe executive, Kevin McAllister, had been at the center of the company\u2019s efforts to fix the automated system that contributed to the two crashes and return the plane to service. This month, The New York Times reported that he was under scrutiny inside the company for his poor handling of customer relationships and his management of the commercial division, which is Boeing\u2019s largest business.\n\nStanley A. Deal, the head of global services for Boeing, will replace Mr. McAllister.\n\nHis departure adds a new element of volatility to the biggest crisis in the company\u2019s 103-year-history. The Max jets have been grounded since March, costing Boeing at least $8 billion and disrupting the global aviation industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to Kevin for his dedicated and tireless service to Boeing, its customers and its communities during a challenging time, and for his commitment to support this transition,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said in a statement.", "description": "Kevin McAllister, the head of Boeing commercial airplanes, is departing as the company struggles to cope with the grounding of the Max.", "authors": ["David Gelles", "Natalie Kitroeff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/business/0000-boeing-mcallister-HFO/0000-boeing-mcallister-HFO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
