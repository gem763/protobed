Although, that\u2019s probably a bit misleading. What they mean \u2013 according to Tanya Latty, a slime mold researcher at the University of Sydney \u2013 is that the blob has 720 known mating types.\n\n\u2018Whether or not a slime mold can mate with another slime mold depends on its mating type which is determined by particular genes,\u2019 Letty told Cnet.\n\n\u00ab Le #blob est difficile \u00e0 placer dans l\u2019arbre du vivant.
