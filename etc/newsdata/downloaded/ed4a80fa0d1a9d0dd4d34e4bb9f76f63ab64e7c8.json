The order told American bombardiers to use the Frederichstrasse Railway Station in Berlin as the aiming point for the day\u2019s air assault on the Third Reich.\n\nTo Doolittle, that sounded a lot like bombing a city. But Americans didn\u2019t bomb cities. The British did that, at night. The Americans conducted high-altitude, daylight precision bombing of military and industrial targets, many of which, to be sure, were in the middle of cities.\n\nDoolittle felt he was being ordered to change U.S. strategy and betray American principle. The Eighth Air Force commander got on the phone with his boss, General Carl \u201cTooey\u201d Spaatz, commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe (and an immediate deputy of General Dwight D. Eisenhower). No transcript of the conversation exists, and Doolittle did not mention the conversation in an autobiography published decades later.\n\nBut a staff officer remembers that hackles were raised and that Spaatz responded to Doolittle\u2019s concern by telling Doolittle, in a not unkind way, to shut the hell up. Moreover, Spaatz reminded Doolittle that Berlin was not a new destination for American bombers and that legitimate targets lay within Adolf Hitler\u2019s capital\u2014Gestapo headquarters, the Air Ministry, railroad facilities, a panzer army on the move, etc.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Did Germany have a center of gravity?", "authors": ["Warfare History Network"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xkgeHiawh6wFYV8CY6fm.w--~B/aD05OTU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/849e960e27ce9d0d079be3c1b7fd3033", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
