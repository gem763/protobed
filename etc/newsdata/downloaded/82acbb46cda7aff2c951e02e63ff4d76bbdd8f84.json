She will also be hosted by President Xi Jinping for dinner and meet with students as part of the trip.\n\nIn their letter, the activists wrote: \"Germany should also be on its guard doing business with China, as China does not respect international law and has repeatedly broken its promises.\"\n\nWong and the other co-signatories leaned on Merkel's personal experience growing up in the former East Germany. \"Chancellor Merkel, you grew up in the GDR. You have first-hand experience of the terror of a dictatorial government,\" the letter said.\n\nMerkel discussed the situation in Hong Kong with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson during his visit to Berlin late last month; the German capital has become a destination for pro-democracy dissidents fleeing both Hong Kong and mainland China over recent years.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Berlin tweeted that it agrees with the contents of the letter.", "description": "The German chancellor will fly to China this week for talks.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171723864-1200x628.jpg"}
