(Erin Schaff/New York Times/Pool/AP)\n\nWhen then-presidential candidate Donald Trump announced in August 2016 that \u201cthey will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT,\u201d few took him seriously.\n\nThree years on \u2014 and after many more related Trump remarks, now as U.S. president \u2014 there were no laughs Monday when British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn warned of a \u201cTrump-deal Brexit,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s repeated offers of a post-Brexit trade deal between the United States and Britain. Such an agreement, Corbyn argued, would lead to \u201ca one-sided United States trade deal that will put us at the mercy of Donald Trump and the biggest American corporations.\u201d\n\nEven as the Brexit battle heats up \u2014 with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Conservative, planning to suspend Parliament next week and threatening to expel rebellious Conservative members of Parliament from the party \u2014 Trump has managed to keep inserting himself into the Brexit debate.\n\nBut has he managed to persuade Brits to take his remarks seriously? British analysts aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cNobody really takes him entirely literally,\u201d said David Henig, director of the U.K. Trade Policy Project at the European Center for International Political Economy.\n\nIn his address Monday, Corbyn was referring to a no-deal Brexit, under which ties between continental Europe and Britain would be abruptly cut without arrangements in place to alleviate the impact \u2014 a scenario that appears increasingly possible under Johnson. The Corbyn-led Labour Party and other Brexit critics argue that such an abrupt exit from the European Union would trigger food and drug shortages and force Britain into trade talks with the United States from a weakened negotiating position.\n\nThose concerns are partially motivated by Trump\u2019s remarks. In June, the president suggested that Britain\u2019s National Health Service would be part of any post-Brexit trade talks. Although Trump quickly backtracked, British politicians, including those considered close to him, continue to express opposition to the idea.\n\nJohnson said in July that he would \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d agree to put the NHS up for sale.\n\nAnalysts have questioned how much sway Trump would have over a trade deal, even if he was serious about it.\n\n\u201cThe power that the president has to sort of force [a trade deal] into being by sheer force of will is actually fairly limited,\u201d said Jacob Parakilas, a consultant and former deputy head of the U.S. and the Americas program at the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned this year that Congress would block any trade deals with Britain if the British government were to weaken the Northern Ireland peace pact known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThat hurdle had already doomed then-British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement with the E.U., which was designed in a way that would have upheld the peace pact by keeping border controls suspended. It also would have tied Britain to the E.U. to a greater extent than hard-line Brexiteers were willing to agree to. May was unable to get Parliament to approve her deal, and she ultimately resigned.\n\nTrump started to lash out at May\u2019s more moderate Brexit strategy early on in his term and advocated in favor of the more hard-line approach backed by Johnson \u2014 a fellow Conservative and rival of May \u2014 and others.\n\nIn an interview with the Sun tabloid, published while he was in Britain for talks with May last year, Trump praised Johnson as someone who would make a \u201cgreat prime minister\u201d and complained that May \u201cdidn\u2019t listen\u201d to his Brexit advice. (May later told the BBC that Trump advised her to \u201csue the E.U. \u2014 not go into negotiations.\u201d)\n\nHer more moderate plans, which would have preserved a number of economic ties to the E.U., would become a hurdle for any U.S.-Britain trade talks, Trump warned in his interview with the Sun, as the United States would be \u201cdealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the U.K.\u201d\n\nIn Johnson, Trump appears to have found a more receptive ally. In June, Trump suggested that Britain should refuse to pay the E.U. its $47 billion divorce bill in case of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson took a similar stance in August.\n\nAlthough that move may charm Trump, it would risk further disgruntling E.U. leaders.\n\nThe E.U. also has warned that Johnson\u2019s hard-line approach is jeopardizing the very Northern Ireland peace pact that the European Union and Pelosi are seeking to preserve at all costs, which would make congressional approval for a U.S.-Britain trade deal improbable \u2014 unless Republicans win the House and the Senate next year.\n\n\u201cTrump has seized this sort of moment in world politics as the rise of the nationalists, and I think he sees some of the leading figures behind Brexit as having a similarly nationalistic view of the world,\u201d Parakilas said.\n\nThe problem is that \u201ccreating an alliance with nationalists is ultimately a fairly unsteady prospect because the point of nationalism is you put your nation\u2019s interests first,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nBritain\u2019s Johnson threatens to purge rebel party members as Brexit battle heats up", "description": "Trump has managed to remain a central voice in Britain\u2019s Brexit discourse, three years after he said that \"they will soon be calling me MR.
