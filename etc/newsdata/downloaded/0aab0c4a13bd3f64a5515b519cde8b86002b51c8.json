Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday uttered the N-word during a live radio interview while discussing racist slurs against Italian Americans.\n\nMr. Cuomo, referencing a New York Times editorial titled, \u201cHow Italians Became \u2018White,\u201d spoke to WAMC about how racists used to describe Italian immigrants as \u201cn\u2013-r wops,\u201d using the uncensored version of the slur, the New York Post reported.\n\n\u201cThey used an expression that southern Italians were called, I believe they were saying southern Italians, Sicilians \u2014 I\u2019m half Sicilian \u2014 were called, quote-unquote and pardon my language, but I\u2019m just quoting the Times: \u2018n\u2013-r wops.\u2019 N-word wops, as a derogatory comment,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cWhen I said that \u2018wop\u2019 was a derogatory comment, that was when the Times Union told me, no, you should look in Wikipedia, \u2018wop\u2019 really meant a dandy,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year, the governor defended his CNN host brother Chris Cuomo after a video went viral showing the anchor delivering an expletive-filled tirade to a heckler who called him \u201cFredo,\u201d which he equated to the N-word for Italian-Americans.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
