The federal funds rate is now 1.75% to 2%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, which usually moves in directions opposite to the yellow metal, remained largely unchanged following the move as the cut was widely expected.\n\nGold prices recovered today, but traders remained cautious amid uncertainty over the next Fed\u2019s move.\n\nThe central bank has two more policy meetings for the year, in October and December, but there is no certainty it would cut rates further. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool puts the odds of a rate cut in October at less than 50%, but forecasts another rate cut in December.\n\nWhile not affecting gold prices today, worries of a no-deal Brexit eased somewhat today after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he believes a deal could be passed before the deadline.\n\n\u201cI think we can have a deal,\u201d Juncker said in an interview with Sky News. \u201cI am doing everything to have a deal because I don\u2019t like the idea of a no-deal because I think this would have catastrophic consequences for at least one year.\u201d\n\nHis comments sent the British pound higher against the U.S. dollar, but had little impact on the safe-haven gold today.", "description": "Gold Prices Rise, Recover from Losses After Fed\u2019s Decisions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1M0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
