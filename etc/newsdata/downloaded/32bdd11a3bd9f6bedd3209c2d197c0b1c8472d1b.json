The Tigers received 1,476 points, two more than Alabama, for the closest margin between 1 and 2 since No. 1 Florida State was two points ahead of Auburn on Oct. 5, 2014.\n\nNo. 3 Ohio State was not far behind with 1,468 points. Eight points separating first from third is the fewest in the regular season since Dec. 3, 1979, when No. 1 Ohio State was 10 points ahead of No. 3 Southern California, with Oklahoma in between, two back of the Buckeyes.\n\nAP Top 25 1.

LSU and Ohio State both got 17 first-place votes. No. 4 Clemson received seven first-place votes.\n\nThe Alabama-LSU game is scheduled for Nov. 9 in Tuscaloosa, but the top of the rankings should be locked until then. LSU, Alabama, Ohio State and No. 5 Penn State are all off next week, and Clemson is tuning up against Wofford.\n\nOklahoma became the third top-six team in the past three weeks to lose to an unranked team, falling at Kansas State and dropping five spots to No. 10.\n\nPOLL POINTS\n\nThere was a lot going on at the top of the rankings this week.\n\nThis is the second time this season that the No. 1 team won but dropped out of the top spot. Preseason No. 1 Clemson was the first, back in late September. The last time it happened twice in a season with different teams was 2009, when Florida and Alabama dropped out in consecutive weeks.\n\nThe last time the No. 1 team did not receive the most first-place votes was Nov. 30, 2014, when No. 2 Florida State had 29 and No. 1 Alabama had 25.\n\nThe eight-point margin between the top three teams is the closest since 1978, when the weighting of the votes changed to its current format. The smallest margin in the top three in the current format previously was nine in the 1994 preseason poll -- No. 1 Florida, 1,416; No. 2 Notre Dame, 1,414; and No. 3 Florida State, 1,407.\n\nGAMES OF THE CENTURY\n\nBarring some weirdness with the voters next week, Alabama-LSU will be the 26th 1 vs. 2 regular-season game, including conference championship games. The No. 1 team is 15-8-2, including LSU's 9-6 victory at Alabama in 2011, the last time that 1 and 2 met in the regular season.\n\nThe advent of the Bowl Championship Series in 1998, and then later the College Football Playoff, created frequent 1-2 matchups during bowl season. Overall, No. 1 is 28-21-2. After LSU and Alabama played as 1 and 2 in the regular season, they had a rematch in the BCS Championship Game in January 2012 that was won by the Crimson Tide.\n\nIN\n\n\u2022 No. 22 Kansas State returned to the rankings after a brief stint in September.\n\n\u2022 No. 24 Memphis Tigers also returned after a one-week stay earlier this month.\n\n\u2022 No. 25 San Diego State is in the ranking for the first time since the final 2017 poll.\n\nOUT\n\n\u2022 Texas fell out of the rankings for the first time this season after losing its third game, this time to unranked TCU. The Longhorns' other losses were to LSU and Oklahoma.\n\n\u2022 Iowa State continues its yo-yo season, falling out of the rankings again after losing at home to Oklahoma State.\n\n\u2022 Arizona State is out again after being upset by UCLA.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nBig Ten -- 6 (Nos. 3, 5, 13, 14, 18, 19)\n\nSEC -- 5 (Nos. 1, 2, 6, 8, 11)\n\nBig 12 -- 3 (Nos. 10, 12, 22)\n\nAmerican -- 3 (Nos. 15, 17, 24)\n\nACC -- 2 (Nos. 4, 23)\n\nPac-12 -- 2 (Nos. 7, 9)\n\nMountain West -- 2 (Nos. 21, 25).\n\nSun Belt -- 1 (No. 20).\n\nIndependent -- 1 (No. 16).\n\nRANKED vs. RANKED\n\nNo. 6 Florida vs. No. 8 Georgia. The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party will likely decide the SEC East.\n\nNo. 15 SMU at No. 24 Memphis.
