Studies have shown that very young children react more positively when they see examples of fair treatment than unfair treatment.\n\nSo why then, are so many people still treated so unfairly throughout the world?\n\nInjustice, according to Dr Liz Jackson, an associate professor of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s faculty of education, is when someone finds themself in a difficult situation through no fault of their own. For example, if someone is treated differently because of the way they look or where they come from.\n\nHow to check your bias when sharing news on social media\n\nWhen people experience or learn about an injustice, many will feel pity or concern for the person who is suffering. It\u2019s something that Jackson often sees in people who\u2019ve witnessed some form of injustice.\n\n\u201cSome people may feel sad, hurt, or worried on behalf of [another] person,\u201d she says.\n\nThis may seem like the right way to react, but what people aren\u2019t always aware of is that they are more likely to feel compassion and empathy towards those they identify with, such as people of the same age or gender as them.\n\nIt's important to show empathy to everyone, not just those who are like you.

If handled in the right way, negative emotions can even become our fuel to fight social injustice.\n\nDon't underestimate the power of social media to fight injustice\n\n\u201cSome philosophers say that expressing our anger [in response] to injustice can be a positive way of communicating that someone is hurt, shocked, and experiencing a bad situation that should be improved,\u201d says Jackson.\n\nSome psychologists also believe that anger can be healthy for society, and can help people to \u201creact against injustice, work against it, and prevent it in the future,\u201d she adds.\n\nHowever, we should also stay mindful and not let anger get in the way of thinking rationally.\n\n\u201cRage can lead people to say things they don\u2019t mean, which is not productive,\u201d says Jackson.\n\nIs your mental health suffering because of the protests? It might be compassion fatigue\n\nPeople controlled by anger might be motivated to hurt others or seek revenge; either outcome is likely to result in a lose-lose situation, or create a vicious cycle in which more problems are created.\n\n\u201cHurting someone does not necessarily stop them from hurting you,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cInstead, it can lead to more suffering: they might hurt you back, or you might feel guilty or ashamed of your actions later.\u201d\n\nSo what can be done to prevent strong emotional reactions from clouding our judgement or causing more damage? Jackson suggests talking through how we feel with someone in a non-judgmental environment, where everyone feels calm and comfortable.\n\nCalm conversations with other people can help you empathise and learn their point of view.

Rather, it is to help us observe injustice more objectively and respond to it with caution.\n\nJackson is currently working on a book about the difficulties of understanding one\u2019s emotions, which will be published next year.", "description": "Too often, we can only relate to people we identify with, but it's important to empathise with everyone", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/justice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
