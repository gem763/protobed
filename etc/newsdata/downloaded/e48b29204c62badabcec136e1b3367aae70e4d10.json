The explosion sent a plume of smoke into the night sky over Kabul and caused a nearby gasoline station to burst into flames.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s \u2018peace agreement\u2019 is a betrayal of Afghanistan and its people | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nAnother interior ministry official, Bahar Maher, told the local Tolo news channel that the blast was caused by a car bomb.\n\n\u201cIt was a horrifying explosion,\u201d a witness, Wali Jan, said. One hospital director, Dr Nezamuddin Jalil, said the wounded included women and children. Associated Press video showed bloodied people streaming into a local hospital.\n\nThe blast occurred during the final minutes of a nationally televised interview with US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on what a US-Taliban deal might mean for Afghanistan\u2019s future.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Khalilzad showed a draft deal to the Afghan president after declaring that they are \u201cat the threshold of an agreement\u201d following the end of the ninth round of US-Taliban talks in Qatar. The agreement still needs Donald Trump\u2019s approval.\n\nTrump last week told Fox News the US planned to reduce its troop presence to 8,600 and then \u201cmake a determination from there.\u201d He has been eager to withdraw troops before the 2020 election and the draft deal meets that deadline.\n\nThe reduction would bring troop levels down to roughly where they were when Trump took office in January 2017. A further troop withdrawal is expected to depend on the Taliban meeting conditions of the deal, including a reduction in violence. Kabul residents question whether any agreement with the Taliban can be trusted, especially as foreign troops withdraw.\n\nThe Taliban are at their strongest since the US-led invasion to topple their government after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, and now control or hold sway over roughly half the country. The insurgents want all of the estimated 20,000 US and Nato forces to leave Afghanistan and already portray their departure as a victory.\n\nAmerica is close to \u2018deal\u2019 with Taliban, hints Trump Read more\n\nFor its part the US seeks Taliban assurances that Afghanistan will not be a safe haven for extremist groups to plan and launch global terror attacks.\n\nReflecting the sensitivity of the negotiations and the Afghan government\u2019s sidelined role in the talks so far, it was not clear whether President Ashraf Ghani was given the draft to keep.\n\n\u201cWe have reached an agreement with the Taliban in principle but of course until the US president agrees with it, it isn\u2019t final,\u201d Khalilzad told Tolo news. He said that under the deal the first 5,000 US troops would withdraw within 135 days from five bases in Afghanistan. Between 14,000 and 13,000 troops are in the country.", "description": "Insurgent group claims responsibility for explosion that killed at least five civilians as US and Taliban agree deal \u2018in principle\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f22e56338897e1865514065fefbf086adab1a3a/0_7_4228_2539/master/4228.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd636e63a50ce0131b6f8ad70d520af3"}
