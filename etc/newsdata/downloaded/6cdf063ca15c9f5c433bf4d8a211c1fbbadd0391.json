Is it mad? Bosses don't think so.\n\nRay Massey road tests new Honda Civic diesel in Rome\n\nModern diesels that are cleaner, leaner and more fuel-efficient are still in significant demand, particularly for high mileage drivers, Honda insists.\n\nThough sales have dipped, they will still account for a third of Civics sold by 2021 and will be a necessary stop-gap before electric cars have the range to make them truly practical.\n\nBuilt at Honda's Swindon factory, the new tenth generation five-door Civic hatchback has already established itself as a solid choice with sporty looks, and the high-performance Type-R has claimed a clutch of awards.\n\nThe 'comprehensively revised' 120 bhp 1.6 litre i-DTEC turbo-diesel engine now joins the two existing 1 litre and 1.5 litre petrol engines in the line-up.\n\n'It's a smooth operator \u2014 particularly on motorways \u2014 and drives and handles well with ample pulling power and a precise six-speed manual gearbox', says Ray Massey\n\nThere are four trim levels and it meets the latest Euro 6 emissions rules, making it cleaner than many petrol engines.\n\nIt's a smooth operator \u2014 particularly on motorways \u2014 and drives and handles well with ample pulling power and a precise six-speed manual gearbox. It goes from rest to 62 mph in 9.8 seconds and on to 125 mph.\n\nFuel consumption is its trump card with a claimed average of 80.7 mpg. Prices start from \u00a320,120 for the Civic S, a premium of up to \u00a31,300 over the petrol versions.\n\nFuel consumption is its trump card with a claimed average of 80.7 mpg\n\nThe diesel Civic diesel SE trim level costs from \u00a320,220, the SR from \u00a322,065 and the top of the range EX with all the trimmings including panoramic sun-roof, touch screen controls, leather sears and a suite of safety aids from \u00a324,925.\n\nHonda Civic diesel: Will it fit in my garage? Price: From \u00a320,120 Length: 4,518mm Width: 1,799mm Width (with mirrors): 2.076mm Height: 1,434mm Engine: 1.6 litre i-DTEC four cylinder diesel Power: 120 horse-power (PS) Top speed: 125mph O-62mp: 9.8 seconds Fuel consumption: Average: 80.7mpg Cruising: 83.1mpg Urban: 78.5mpg\n\nLow CO2 emissions too at 93g/km. Unsurprisingly, the drop in demonised diesel sales has led to a rise in emissions of CO2, which environmentalists blame for man-made global warming.\n\nDiesels emit on average about 20 per cent less CO2 and use 20 per cent less fuel than petrol engines, meaning significant savings for motorists and the planet.\n\nBut given that the next generation of Honda\u2019s top-selling CR-V off roader will not feature a diesel variant, which is being replaced by a petrol-electric hybrid, I hear from senior executives that the diesel in the new Civic is also likely to be the last and will probably go too when the next version of this family favourite is launched around 2022.\n\nHonda says about a third of its research and development work goes on the Civic, its bread and butter car, which has sold 24million over 10 generations since the original launched 1972.\n\nMercedes-Benz last night unveiled its new A-Class super-mini. It is priced from about \u00a322,000 and will be available with new 1.4 litre petrol and 1.5 litre diesel engines\n\nMercedes-Benz unveils new 2018 A-Class\n\nMercedes-Benz last night unveiled its new A-Class super-mini.\n\nThe five-door hatchback promises levels of technology similar to the German car giant's flagship S-Class limousine, including semi- autonomous self-driving.\n\nA new 'Hey Mercedes' voice recognition system, similar to Siri, will allow the driver to interact with their car.\n\nPriced from about \u00a322,000, it's the fourth generation of the upmarket hatchback, which is available with new 1.4 litre petrol and 1.5 litre diesel engines. First deliveries in June.\n\nYou can read my more detailed report on the new-for-2018 car in my Mercedes-Benz A-Class story.\n\nBuyers of new Aston Martins now get the chance to own a birth certificate and a glossy book documenting the built of the car that's sitting in their garages or on their driveways\n\nAston Martin owners can now have a birth certificate with their cars\n\nNew Aston Martin owners are to be offered a 'birth certificate' for their vehicle \u2014 as the firm now charts each car's journey from conception to delivery.\n\nCameras at the factory in Warwickshire will capture key moments which are then lavishly packaged in a book with the certificate \u2014 for \u00a3450.", "description": "Honda is boldly adding a diesel variant to the line-up of its British-built Civic.
