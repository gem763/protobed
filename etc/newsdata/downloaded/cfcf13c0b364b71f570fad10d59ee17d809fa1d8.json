(AP) - The Cleveland Browns punted on their first series. It was one of the few things that Freddie Kitchens\u2019 team did right all night.\n\nIn a game where Kitchens and offensive coordinator Todd Monken pulled out all the stops, trying gimmick plays and a little trickery, the Browns repeatedly stopped themselves with turnovers, mistakes and missed tackles.\n\nIn front of a national television audience at that.\n\n\u201cIt was Monday night football. Everybody in the whole world watched that and got to see that,\u201d wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. after Cleveland\u2019s 31-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt would be easy to put this one on Baker Mayfield and the offense, and many will, but that would be misguided.\n\nWhile Mayfield suffered through his worst game as a pro and was the target of a Nick Bosa taunt in the first half, the Browns offered no help on defense or special teams.\n\nSan Francisco outgained Cleveland in total offense 446-180 and had a whopping 275-102 advantage on the ground.\n\nThe Browns\u2018 only score came on Austin Seibert\u2019s 30-yard field goal in the second quarter. Cleveland got into the red zone again on its next series but wide receiver Antonio Callaway bobbled a low pass from Mayfield near the goal line and deflected the ball into the air, where 49ers nickel back K\u2019Waun Williams grabbed it for an interception.\n\nWilliams returned the pick 49 yards to set up San Francisco\u2019s third touchdown that had the 49ers rolling 21-3.\n\n\u201cThat could have been points for us that got taken away and then they drive down the field,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s the little details. You can look back on many more things than just that. Honestly, it\u2019s more than just one play that turned the game around.\u201d\n\nMayfield had more than one bad play, too.\n\nThe Browns\u2018 young quarterback completed 8 of 22 passes for a career-low 100 yards. He threw two interceptions, fumbled twice, was sacked four times and had a paltry 13.4 passer rating.\n\nKitchens defended Mayfield and said the problems were with the entire offense.\n\n\u201cSo much of the quarterback has to do with the things around him,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cLast week he played good because the guys around him played good. Quarterback can\u2019t do it himself so he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers did a good job of harassing Mayfield most of the night, forcing him out of the pocket into hurried throws.\n\n\u201cEvery time I looked up those guys were around the quarterback,\u201d San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cThe way (the defense) played in the fourth quarter was the exact same way as the first quarter.\u201d\n\nThings got so bad that Kitchens pulled Mayfield and replaced him with Garrett Gilbert in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI thought (Mayfield) was taking too many hits unnnecessarily,\u201d Kitchens said.\n\nBefore Mayfield was pulled, San Francisco defensive end Bosa poked fun at the quarterback after forcing him into a hurried incompletion in the second quarter. Bosa, the second overall draft pick, got up and pretended to wave a flag and plant it in the turf as the crowd roared. It was a clear shot at Mayfield, who planted an Oklahoma flag in the turf after leading the Sooners to win over Bosa and Ohio State in 2017.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows what that was for,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cJust wanted to get payback. He had it coming.\u201d\n\nBeckham added to the Browns problems when he coughed up the ball on a punt return. Beckham was running around with the ball held out in one hand and was hit by 49ers safety Marcell Harris, who was called up from the practice squad last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too good to do that,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThe game was close to done. I was just trying to give us some spark, try to give us some life and just did too much. You could feel the energy they had already taken out of us. It just seemed like we were ready to go home and I wanted to keep fighting to the final whistle.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, the momentum the Browns built with their convincing 40-25 road win in Baltimore is gone.\n\nIt won\u2019t get any easier from here, either. Cleveland hosts Seattle on Sunday before its bye, then returns to play at New England on Oct. 27.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hitting the panic button,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything besides looking in the mirror and seeing what we did wrong. It\u2019s as simple as that. We have a short week. It\u2019s going to be very mental for us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Cleveland Browns punted on their first series.
