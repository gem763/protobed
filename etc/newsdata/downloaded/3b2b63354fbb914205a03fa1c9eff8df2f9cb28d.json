Cory Booker (D-NJ) recently sat down with Cosmopolitan and discussed his \u201ccozy\u201d relationship with his girlfriend Rosario Dawson.\n\nAsked what makes him feel \u201ccozy,\u201d Booker told Cosmopolitan Editor-in-Chief Jessica Pels, \u201cThis is so Cosmo. What makes me feel cozy? I\u2019m literally going to be mocked by my own girlfriend because: cuddling up with my girlfriend watching TV.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is horrible. I\u2019ve got to do something. Can we talk about football again? Yeah, but isn\u2019t that great to cuddle up with somebody?\u201d\n\nBooker was then asked whether he preferred a blanket.\n\n\u201cBlanket. This is a good fight,\u201d Cory stated. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, what temperature do you want your \u2014 I\u2019ve read studies on sleep that nice sleep is a little chill. So I like to be chilly and cuddling up.\u201d\n\nBooker went on to say he does not like \u201cstickers on fruit\u201d and explained Dawson and he \u201ccomplement each other very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe keeps me grounded,\u201d Booker stated in regards to Dawson. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t let me take myself too seriously. She thinks I\u2019m really corny, but she thinks it\u2019s really adorable. But we just definitely have personalities I think that resonate like a symphony and not a cacophony, so I feel very, very lucky.\u201d\n\nFollow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.", "description": "Sen.
