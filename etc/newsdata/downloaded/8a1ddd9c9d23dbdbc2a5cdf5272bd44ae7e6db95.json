Investors into the crowdfunding campaign included HR and recruitment experts from all over the world including Tim Sackett, Adam Godson and former RBS Global HR Director Neil Roden.\n\nAdam Gordon, CEO and Co-Founder at Candidate.ID, said: \u201cThis crowdfunding campaign was unique as we initially offered it only to industry peers, as an advocacy-building campaign as much as to raise funds.\n\nWe raised \u00a3500,000 in four weeks from 550 investors and closed the campaign early. Over half of our investors are directly involved in HR and recruitment and include some truly world-famous practitioners within the discipline. We\u2019re really excited about what this investment means for us. Above all, it represents confidence in our growth potential, product and business plan.\u201d\n\nThis investment follows an earlier investment, in January 2019, by Jacobo Invest UG. Candidate.ID customers include Capita, Nationwide, Specsavers and Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alara Basul", "Online Editor Uktn"], "top_image": "https://www.uktech.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_465705089.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
