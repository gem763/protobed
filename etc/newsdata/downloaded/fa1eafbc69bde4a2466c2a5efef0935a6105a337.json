The country turned down the first two requests, made in 2017 and 2018.\n\nPuigdemont went into self-imposed exile in Belgium in 2017 after Catalan separatist leaders organised a referendum that Spanish courts had ruled illegal and made a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nThe protests began after nine Catalan independence leaders were handed jail sentences of between nine and 13 years by Spain's Supreme Court on Monday.\n\nSpain's Supreme Court filed its third extradition today.\n\nIn the clip, the woman stand in front of hundreds of chanting pro-independence protesters before they are mobbed and dragged away by the angry crowd\n\nPolice brandish shields as they surround the crowd after some demonstrators hurled firecrackers and bottles as tensions flared in the region\n\n'Considering the complexity of the file and the two European arrest warrants previously sent against Mr. Puigdemont, the case will require a thorough judicial analysis,' The Brussels prosecutor's spokeswoman said.\n\nIt may take weeks to reach a decision, she said, adding that the key issue for local authorities would be to decide if the convictions for sedition were legally recognised in Belgium.\n\nBelgian courts had used the same criterion in rejecting the first two Spanish requests.\n\nThe latest warrant was submitted in Spanish. The law requires that it be sent in one of Belgium's three national languages or English so Spain will send a new one next week, the spokeswoman said.\n\nThousands of people held vigils near the Spanish government offices in Catalonia's four provinces (pictured)\n\nProtesters create a burning barricade during a rally on Tuesday. In unusually tense confrontations, protesters threw cans, stones and flares at riot police, and set garbage containers and cardboard on fire\n\nThousands of people have held held vigils near the Spanish government offices in Catalonia's four provinces.\n\nBut it was in the northeastern regional capital, Barcelona, where police charged at protesters on Tuesday after some hurled firecrackers and other objects at the officers and kicked temporary fences put in place to protect the building.\n\nThe protesters sang the Catalan anthem and shouted, 'The streets will always be ours,' `'Independence,' as well as slogans calling Spanish police 'occupying forces' and urging them to leave Catalonia.\n\nThis morning it emerged that Spanish cops had arrested 51 people overnight across Catalonia. Madrid claimed today that 72 police officers have been injured during violence over the last two days.\n\nA protester waves the Catalan flag during a rally.

Nearly 1,000 were operating normally, AENA said.\n\nMost impromptu protests are responding to an online campaign by Tsunami Democratic, a loose, leaderless grassroots group that uses encrypted messaging apps to call for peaceful disobedience.\n\nSpain's caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said that authorities were investigating the group.\n\nThe court also barred the 12 convicted Catalan separatists from holding public office.\n\nThat has an immediate impact in the upcoming November 10 Spanish election because six of them were planning to run as candidates to the national parliament.\n\nThe verdict is likely to be a central issue in the run up to the vote but 'it is unlikely to substantially alter the electoral outlook unless the situation worsens significantly in the region,' said Antonio Barroso, a political risk analyst with the London-based Teneo consulting firm.\n\nHe said Catalan separatist politicians wanted to use the backlash against the ruling to woo pro-independence voters to the polls.\n\nOthers have feared that swelling support for Catalan separatism because of the sentences could make the next political term even more key to either breaking the deadlock with separatists or making it a chronicle problem.\n\nRiot police carry their shields as the units walk past a barricade on fire during a demonstration at El Prat airport as clashes erupted on Monday evening\n\nOusted former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont takes part in a protest with Catalan supporters in Brussels\n\nSpain's caretaker prime minister and Socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez, who won the April election but failed to get support for a minority government, is hoping to remain in office.\n\nBut even from the early hours after the 493-page Supreme Court ruling was issued, very different views emerged from Madrid and Catalonia.\n\nWhile Sanchez called for beginning a 'new phase' and urged Catalan separatists to abide by the law, the ruling invigorated the wealthy region's independence movement, with many of its leaders making new calls to work toward effective secession or repeating the slogan 'we will do it again.'\n\nCuixart said over email via his lawyer that he and the others sentenced by the Supreme Court will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n'We have the moral obligation to denounce (Spain's) authoritarian drift and appeal to European citizens to defend human rights,' Cuixart Tuesday.\n\nThe Catalan regional president, Quim Torra, said secessionists won't give up their fight.\n\n'A referendum is the most positive solution for solving this situation,' he told foreign reporters in Barcelona on Tuesday.\n\nThe caretaker Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, soon due to become the European Union's top diplomat, said the sentence wasn't resolving the underlying political problems that only dialogue 'in the framework of the Constitution' could.\n\nDemonstrators blocked a corridor inside El Prat Airport in Barcelona with luggage trolleys after nine separatist leaders were jailed on Monday over a failed independence bid\n\nSpain's constitutional law says that the country is indivisible.\n\n'Yesterday, today and tomorrow it is and remains a political problem that has to be solved,' Borrell told foreign reporters, adding that Catalan separatists shouldn't ignore Catalans like him who are against independence.\n\n'When one excludes part of the population because they don't think like one, and only considers as the people those who think like one, this is a totalitarian attitude,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a former member of the Catalan regional government who was among the sentenced said he regretted that the situation ended so badly.\n\nSanti Vila, who evaded a prison sentence but was fined for disobedience, said 'we should have been more capable of creating a framework of trust between the government of Catalonia and the government of Spain' so as 'to put the conflict on the right track.'\n\nConsidered a traitor by the pro-independence camp, Vila resigned as Catalonia's business minister a day before the Catalan Parliament unilaterally declared secession on October 27, 2017.\n\nProtests are likely to extend throughout the week. A three-day student strike begins Wednesday in the region, and a worker's union has called a separate strike for Friday.", "description": "Riot police were forced to step in at Tarraco Square in Tarragona, near Barcelona, as violent clashes erupted for the third consecutive day in the early hours of Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19781496-0-image-a-56_1571220184940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
