I would take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal: People are gonna be lined up for this job,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cThey absolutely will.\u201d\n\nSo far, nobody else is in line with Ryan. A report said Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, annually brought up as a good NFL coaching candidate, is not interested in the Redskins.\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin was asked about the vacancy and deflected the question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the head coach of a 1-4 football team that\u2019s going on the road to play a Hall of Fame quarterback with a third-string quarterback. Do you think I\u2019m worried about anything other than that?\u201d Tomlin said.\n\nRyan does have a connection to Washington, though. His twin brother, Rob Ryan, is working his first season as the team\u2019s inside linebackers coach.\n\nHe has an all-time record of 61-66 across six season with New York and two with Buffalo.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
