We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.\u201d\n\nWell, Mr Car Man, I have a few points to raise with you.\n\nAdults have destroyed the planet. That\u2019s her WHOLE campaign. Real life adults who should know better, are destroying the planet and ruining her future.\n\nAnd more importantly, she\u2019s a literal CHILD. Adults are meant to do shit for her. That\u2019s the point. That\u2019s what you sign up for when you have a child.\n\nBut his ridiculous column didn\u2019t end there. No, sir.\n\n\u201cScience is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes,\u201d the Grand Tour presenter said, despite the fact that we have to invest in science and innovation to fix these issues, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight.\n\n\u201cMany thousands of people who you had the temerity to blame this week are trying to do exactly what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cSo be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, \u201cgood girl\u201d is either patronising or weirdly creepy coming from a man who\u2019s old enough to be her grandfather.\n\nBut more importantly, Clarkson\u2019s own offspring, Emily, has already taken to Twitter to remind us all that she doesn\u2019t support her dad\u2019s opinions. Hmm\u2026 sounds a lot like Barnaby Joyce\u2019s daughter, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if all middle aged blokes could talk to and about Greta, the ballsy af teenager out there changing the world, like this \u2764\ufe0f???? https://t.co/WQuAvkwISV \u2014 Em Clarkson (@EmilyClarkson) September 26, 2019\n\nNow, you don\u2019t have to agree with Greta. I mean, who on Earth would agree with the teenager who\u2019s dedicating her life to making sure we\u2019ve still got a planet to live on in 20 years time? But what you do need to do is give her the respect she deserves.\n\nShe\u2019s not a happy, sweet young woman who wants to sit back and enjoy life. No. She\u2019s a terrified teenager who is finally doing something about her problems, rather than crying in her room listening to My Chemical Romance\u2019s Welcome To The Black Parade like I was at 16.\n\nThis is an actual child. She can\u2019t vote, she can\u2019t drink, she can barely drive a car. So why the fuck should she be subjected to ignorant old men like Jeremy Clarkson bullying her via massive media outlets like The Sun?", "description": "Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has penned an opinion piece in his The Sun column, calling Greta Thunberg a \"spoilt brat\" who should \"shut up.\"", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/clarkson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
