That was how long a group of our fans camped outside Providence Park before the game against FC Dallas. They already had tickets, but just wanted to be first into the stadium. Sounds crazy right?\n\nI was walking around the city with Nat Borchers and we stopped to have a chat. It\u2019s wicked to see supporters' passion, and they carry that throughout the matches. The atmosphere is special.\n\nOn game day I love the national anthem at the start. It\u2019s not mine but it really gees me up. The fans swing their scarves and sing. It\u2019s an honour to play in front of them.\n\nLiam Ridgewell in action for the Portland Timbers with the new MLS season well under way in the States\n\nRidgewell (right) attempts to gee up his side during a match against New York City FC last week\n\nWe beat Dallas 3-1 for our first victory of the season, which was especially pleasing as my children Luca and Eva were over visiting with my parents Bob and Linda. Nice to get up and running.\n\nIt\u2019s been raining quite a bit but one day we got the paddle boards out, and the kids had a splash on the lake behind my house.\n\nLuca, who\u2019s nine, came into training with me every day. He pottered about, spoke to the lads, and kicked the ball around. I don\u2019t know about having his old man\u2019s talent \u2013 can we call it that? \u2013 but he loves it. There is a lot of pressure on younger kids now, I don\u2019t want to be too pushy, let him enjoy it.\n\nHe went training with the Timbers Under-9s one day and met Gavin Wilkinson, the general manager, and the owner Merritt Paulson. He was asking loads of questions about how much he\u2019d spent and how much various things cost, as kids do. There were no boundaries. Merritt was lovely and had a bit of banter. Perhaps Luca will pursue a career as an agent!\n\nEither that or a personal trainer. He spotted a dodge ball court at the local play centre so we had a game. After 20 minutes my thighs were burning. It is nothing like the film, there are trampolines and it\u2019s tiring bouncing from one to the next. Luca wanted to keep going. I tried to teach him the dodge, dip, dive, and duck routine but he wasn\u2019t having any of it.\n\nMy kids have now left and watching them go at the airport is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. It seems to get worse every time. They are coming back in July and I\u2019m excited already.\n\nRidgewell (back, second right) lines up for a Portland Timbers team photo ahead of an MLS match\n\nPortland Timbers and Orlando City walk onto the field ahead of an MLS match in Oregon earlier this month\n\nPortland Timbers mascot Timber Joey uses a chainsaw to cut a timber slab after a goal is scored\n\nINTRODUCING... NAT BORCHERS Nat is my central defensive partner and beard brother. I\u2019ve been trying to grow mine for ages, everyone tells me to shave but I\u2019m keeping it to annoy people. When I saw Nat\u2019s, though, I just thought, \u2018He\u2019s ruined it\u2019. His is huge and makes me look like a nine year old boy. It\u2019s a proper beard, you could certainly hide some squirrels in there. Nat Borchers holds up a timber slab after Portland beat FC Dallas 3-1 earlier this month\n\nThe whole family of 12 is flying out and I had Dad doing some jobs around the house to prepare. He\u2019s sorted the outdoor parasols and kegerator, which lets you have beer on tap. I\u2019ve been practising the table tennis ready for a comp with my brothers.\n\nOne of them, Gavin, is a travel freak and he\u2019s already bought a book on what to do. There are a lot of vineyards we can visit and we want to trek up Mount Hood, the highest point in Oregon.\n\nIt is technically an active volcano, though I read the chances of an eruption in the next 30 years are about three per cent, so I think we\u2019ll be alright. You can ski its slopes and canoe its rivers.\n\nI\u2019d like to stay in a log cabin on a night off. There is no TV and you\u2019re right out in the wilderness, surrounded by woods. Hopefully it will be a good summer.\n\nI\u2019ll be wearing my Thomas Royall shorts when the sun shines. We have just designed our summer 16 range, and had more enquiries from shops. I give my input when I wake up.\n\nTo organise the current range we went to a hotel in London (during the MLS winter break) and sifted through thousands of prints laid out in front of us, more or less going off our instincts. Your eyes are popping out by the end of the meeting. Hopefully we\u2019ll see the shorts out in Vegas.\n\nA lot of the success is down to our model Stephen James Hendry. We picked him because we needed to stand out and project the funky hairstyles and tattoos you see around Shoreditch and Hoxton. Our photographer Adam recommended him. He was very much in demand.\n\nHe\u2019s a lovely fella. We went out for a meal and he likes to talk football and we like to talk fashion. It\u2019s been great.\n\nAfter Dallas we lost at home to Orlando, who were inspired by Kaka. He kept it simple with one-twos and his presence on the pitch was clear.\n\nKaka (front centre) poses for a photo alongside his Orlando City team-mates ahead of the Portland match\n\nKaka (left) on the ball with Montreal Impact's Nigel Reo-Coker giving chase during a match last month\n\nIt was frustrating not to do better but I watched him play in the World Cup so to walk out with him and be captain on the same day was a real privilege. On the pendant handover I said good luck but that was about it. I don\u2019t know if he knows English, Gracias and Bonjour is my lingo limit.\n\nWe redeemed ourselves in the next game at New York City, winning 1-0. The clean sheet was hugely satisfying. When I first signed my professional contract with Aston Villa I took the family to America and New York. We did all the shows but not Yankee Stadium, so it was surreal to play on that grass. I got a couple of pictures standing on the pitcher\u2019s mound.\n\nTo win there was special. David Villa didn\u2019t play because of injury but hopefully I can face him later on this campaign.\n\nNew York City FC's David Villa (right) looks to leave New England Revolution's Scott Caldwell in his wake\n\nUp next on Sunday night US time are Seattle Sounders, our fiercest rivals. I would say local but the city is about 150 miles away. There will be 65,000 there and the atmosphere promises to be intense, louder than a Villa-Blues derby.\n\nLast season I was on the bench as I had just signed and wasn\u2019t able to play. I sat looking at the thousands of fans, the fireworks, and the flags thinking \u2018Wow\u2019. I knew I had made the right call to come to the MLS.\n\nPortland Timbers players run out onto the field ahead of clash with rivals Seattle Sounders in 2013", "description": "Portland Timbers defender Liam Ridgewell writes his second column for Sportsmail with the 2015 Major League Soccer season well under way in the United States.", "authors": ["Liam Ridgewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2015-04-26"}
