In a recording the mother shared with police, her son declared, \"911 will bow down before me.\"\n\nPolice interpreted what they found as preparations for an attack and were so troubled that they recorded floor plans of the property and shared the information with the city's SWAT team, according to incident reports.\n\nOfficers believed Ator was volatile and might hurt somebody someday. Amarillo police spokesman Cpl. Jeb Hilton says that a documents request Sunday from The Associated Press about the February 2011 case has been forwarded to the agency's Open Records Department.\n\nThe police incident reports raise new questions about whether more could have been done to prevent Ator's shooting spree in the cities of Midland and Odessa, Texas. It's unclear how Ator, who once failed a background check for an attempted firearm purchase, acquired the AR-15-style rifle he used in the attack. Officers killed Ator outside a busy Odessa movie theater after the shooting rampage that lasted more than an hour.\n\n\"There seemed to be some indication of some planned standoff with police,\" one of the responding officers wrote in a report following the 2011 encounter.\n\nAnother officer stated in an incident report at the time that he believed Ator \"will attempt to harm the police and the public.\"\n\nAfter inspecting the home, officers transported Ator to a hospital and he was medicated and admitted to a mental health treatment facility, according to the report.\n\nPolice reports note that while in that facility Ator told security: \"The police can't be everywhere.\" An officer stated: \"I took this as a threat against the public.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
