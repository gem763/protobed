Should Twitter have suspended the account of a far-right militia that spoke of a \u201chot\u201d civil war? And, of course, the developments at the core of it all: reports that President Trump might have tried to strong-arm a foreign government to kneecap a would-be presidential challenger, Joe Biden, and that Democrats might try to impeach him for it.\n\nLive updates: Top Democrat warns White House \u2018we\u2019re not fooling around\u2019 on impeachment inquiry\n\nIt\u2019s an escalation of stakes many believe will cause the end times of online outrage and misinformation. But if Twitter really is hell, what does it matter if the dial controlling the intensity of our torment clicks from 11 to 12? Will we even feel the difference?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are signs that Impeachment Internet is the same but more. Conspiracy-driven memes are already ping-ponging back and forth between the fringes and the conservative mainstream \u2014 all of which are then covered by the rest of the media. Meanwhile, #Resistance Twitter feeds its own memes and conspiracy-driven speculation into the mix. The president himself tweeted about \u201ccivil war,\u201d an idea that is central to, among other things, the rhetoric of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has claimed for years that the United States is on the verge of a new civil war. Trolls on 4chan and other fringe boards are echoing the demands of Trump and other prominent conservatives by trying to unmask the government whistleblower whose reporting set the impeachment inquiry in motion.\n\nLast week, Republican talking points accidentally sent to congressional Democrats mentioned the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a phrase commonly used by conspiracy-minded Trump supporters (and, increasingly, the president and his mainstream allies) to refer to government bureaucrats thought to be working in secret to oust Trump. On Monday, \u201cArrest for Treason\u201d trended after the president used the phrase in a tweet. On Tuesday, #IAmtheWhistleblower trended among the #Resistance set \u2014 an \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d-like gesture of solidarity that seemed to be aimed more at triggering conservatives than anything else.\n\nKamala Harris wants Trump suspended from Twitter for \u2018harassment.' These 3 loopholes protect him.\n\n\u201cI am already seeing the disinformation and misinformation tick up,\u201d said Brooke Binkowski, the former managing editor of Snopes, a website dedicated to investigating and dispelling popular myths. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I think we will be seeing more that\u2019s different,\u201d said Binkowski, who is now managing editor of another myth-busting site, Truth or Fiction. \u201cI think we were just going to see more volume of the same crap that has been used for years now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe misinformation spike will hit a public that has grown accustomed to the intensity, even as it has left us exhausted and irritable. We may notice the change but only because it inflames a preexisting condition. And, so, misinformation and online culture experts wonder: What has the modern political Internet done to us, and could the Impeachment Internet make it worse?\n\n\u201cThis reminds me, in a strange way, of yoga,\u201d wrote Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication at Syracuse University who studies media manipulation and troll culture, in an email. \u201cWhat happens when you practice regularly is that you create space in your body and mind \u2014 more space for deeper stretches, and more space for more awareness.\"\n\n\u201cWhat the Trump era requires,\u201d Phillips said, \u201cis a kind of dark psychic yoga that also creates space. More space for more vexation, and more space for more tolerance for that vexation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019ve been stretching for a long time.\n\nMisinformation online often feels like deja vu. The specifics might change, but the mechanisms remain the same. Pizzagate was a baseless conspiracy theory that went viral just after the 2016 elections; it accused a Washington pizza place of harboring a pedophile ring with connections to the Clintons and other Democrats. The pattern repeated with QAnon, a sprawling conspiracy theory that also accuses the Clintons and other Democrats of being involved in child sex-trafficking. In both cases, the theory moved from the fringes to the mainstream due to the aggressiveness of the pro-Trump Internet and the curiosity of the mainstream media.\n\n\u201cThey are already invoking Hillary Clinton and George Soros as blame/explanation for what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, for gods sake,\u201d Binkowski wrote, referring to the billionaire liberal philanthropist long viewed by the right as a boogeyman. \u201cThey are the exact same as what got pushed on us in 2016. It\u2019s insulting, really.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlaying \u2018Untitled Goose Game\u2019 is the new punching a wall\n\nThe problem doesn\u2019t just have to do with the content of online misinformation, according to Binkowski; it\u2019s also the volume. Trump, and many key figures in the pro-Trump Internet, are good at overwhelming their perceived enemies.\n\nThe Impeachment Internet will never just be about impeachment; it\u2019ll be about impeachment and Joe Biden and the Clintons and Soros and the media \u2014 and random people on Twitter and outrages from years ago that can still go viral if shared in the right place. It will be about 10, 20, 100 things at once. It is an inseparable blend of fact and fiction and anger and fear and lamentation. It will be hot and exhausting.\n\n\u201cThere is only so much you can react to in one day or even an hour,\u201d Binkowski said, \u201cand it exhausts fact-checkers and reporters and eventually burns everybody out and makes them stop caring.\u201d The only way to escape, she said, is to log off and focus on offline things that make you happy. But Phillips admitted she struggled with doing that, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhillips said she realized recently how exhausted the Trump era had made her. She was attending a conference in Canada when news broke that Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, had worn brownface at a party years back. There were pictures. The people around her seemed genuinely shocked.\n\n\u201cWatching a conference full of Canadian educators react to an American-style scandal was surprisingly revealing,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThey were shocked! They were capable of being shocked! They talked about it nonstop for two days!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Canadians\u2019 reactions were normal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to be normal anymore.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the president tweeted that the impeachment inquiry was \u201cBULLSHIT,\u201d and fired off a rampage of insults at various Democrats. The trending hashtags were #TrumpMeltdown and #DoNothingDemocrats.\n\nMore reading:\n\nAmateur pro-Trump \u2018sleuths\u2019 scramble to unmask whistleblower: \u2018Your president has asked for your help\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s moat idea is ridiculous \u2014 but it isn\u2019t funny\n\nThe dangerous cycle that keeps conspiracy theories in the news \u2014 and Trump\u2019s tweets\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWhat the Trump era requires is a kind of dark psychic yoga that also creates space.
