The most recent contribution from IIROC was $250,000 in operational funding, following a rejection of FAIR\u2019s application for $2 million.\n\n\u201cThe IIROC funding came from its restricted fund, which had in excess of $15 million, consisting of fines levied for regulatory breaches mostly involving harm to retail investors,\u201d FAIR said.\n\nIn response, IIROC said the self-regulatory agency and its predecessors have committed nearly $5 million to FAIR since 2008, and noted that the restricted fund money comes from firms and individuals that have broken IIROC\u2019s regulatory rules and is to be devoted primarily to funding the operation of the regulator\u2019s disciplinary functions.\n\n\u201cWe would also point to the more than $6 million IIROC has provided from this fund to a number of organizations that also support investor protection and education, as well as financial literacy,\u201d Paul Howard, director of communications, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cAll of these organizations are doing valuable work on behalf of Canadian investors and IIROC is proud to support them.\u201d\n\nFAIR Canada, which has been led by lawyers including Neil Gross and founder Ermanno Pascutto \u2014 who returned as executive director earlier this year following the departure of Frank Allan \u2014 noted the investment industry is represented by more than a dozen associations while FAIR stood as the only national advocate for retail investors.\n\nStephen Jarislowsky, the billionaire investor behind the foundation that bears his name and provided initial funds to FAIR Canada, said government should fund a professional organization that speaks for retail investors and financial consumers.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t fund such an organization then governments are not truly committed to investor protection in substance,\u201d Jarislowsky, 94, said in a statement released by FAIR. Instead, he said, \u201cthey are satisfied with the \u2018appearance\u2019 of investor protection.\u201d\n\nHis statement noted that regulators have accumulated more than $100 million in fine money, collectively, and while they have kept FAIR alive to this point, they have not provided adequate support for it to actually realize its potential or be operationally sustainable.\u201d\n\nJarislowsky stepped down from FAIR\u2019s board of directors when the money was returned to his foundation at the end of last month, according to Friday\u2019s statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ontario Securities Commission declined to comment on why the OSC is no longer funding FAIR Canada.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com | Twitter: BatPost", "description": "FAIR Canada said it had been seeking to fulfill a 200 per cent matching condition set in 2012, but was unable to do so", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jarislowsky.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
