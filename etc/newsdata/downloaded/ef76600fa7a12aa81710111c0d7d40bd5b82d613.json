These lawsuits were allowed due to President Donald Trump\u2019s activation in May of a provision fo the 1996 Helms-Burton Act which was previously waived by every previous president due to opposition from the international community over fears it could create chaos in U.S. courts.\n\nThe Title III provision allows U.S. citizens including Cuban-Americans to file lawsuits against both Cuban entities and foreign companies over property seized after 1959. Gonzales says he is the rightful owner of 2,030 acres of land in Cuba\u2019s easter Granman province which were nationalized in 1964. Authorities gave his family just seven days to vacate the area with their personal belonging.\n\n\u201cThe communist Cuban Government \u2026 has not paid any compensation to Plaintiff for its seizure,\u201d the filing reads. Gonzales claims that Amazon\u2019s promotion of the sale of Marabu charcoal produced on the property means that the firm is trafficking stolen property. Gonzales is also suing Florida-based company Fogo Charcoal for importing the charcoal.\n\nJohn Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, highlighted how many companies could potentially be sued under Title III, stating: \u201cWill the next defendant be Crowley Liner Services, which transported the charcoal from Cuba to the United States? FedEx that delivered some of the charcoal?\u201d\n\nApproximately 11 lawsuits have been filed under Title III against 19 defendants, 14 of which are foreign firms doing business with Cuba to some degree. This includes U.S. cruise lines Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise, and Carnival Corp. Travel website Expedia Group Inc. and Spanish hotel operator Melia Hotels International are also involved in Title III lawsuits.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
