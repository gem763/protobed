Officers arrested the suspect near the Spree River as he stepped from a clump of shrubbery, with his wig gone, his clothes changed, his beard shaved off, and a Russian passport in his pocket.\n\nDays after the Aug. 23 killing, investigators received an email from an anonymous sender. It suggested that the suspect was a hit man who had been released from prison by the Russian authorities in order to carry out the assassination in Berlin. It claimed his real name was Vladimir Alekseevich Stepanov.\n\nBut since then, that early luck appears to have run out. Investigators have a suspect in custody, but they aren\u2019t certain who he is. The man with a shaved head, a hangdog face and arm tattoos, has mostly stayed silent, meeting only consular officers from the Russian Embassy.", "description": "The German authorities suspect the well-planned killing of a former Chechen separatist in Berlin was carried out by a Russian hit man released from prison for that purpose.", "authors": ["Katrin Bennhold", "Michael Schwirtz", "Christiaan Triebert"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/world/xxberlinkiller1/xxberlinkiller1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
