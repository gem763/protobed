However, the costume sold by the fancy dress shop does not appear to carry the symbol which has become synonymous with fascism.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Holocaust Educational Trust, a charity which educates about the horrors of WWII, has criticised the costume and called for it to be removed from the store.\n\nSpeaking to The Tab, CEO Karen Pollock MBE said: \u201cI cannot see any scenario where 'dressing up' as a Nazi is an appropriate choice for fancy dress.\n\n\"I sincerely hope the shop reconsiders and removes such an offensive item.\"\n\nHowever, Awal Yousoff, manager at Party On, has defended the costume, explaining that the shop sells many of its costumes to professional actors.\n\n\"This particular costume is mainly purchased by that type of customer, it doesn't really get sold around Halloween.\n\n\u201cWe would like to apologise to anyone who's offended by the costume.\u201d\n\nThis incident is not the first time that clothing associated with anti-Semitism has come under fire.\n\nLast week, an investigation was launched after photos emerged of university students wearing T-shirts with racist slogans written on them, including \u201cHitler wanted my kind alive\u201d.\n\n(The Tab / SWNS) More\n\nThe photo of the T-shirt which circulated on social media is believed to be from a \u201cwhite t-shirt social\u201d at the University of Leicester, an event where students wear white t-shirts and then write on each other.\n\nIn a statement Leicester University's Student's Union said they are investigating an incident at an \u201cunauthorised\u201d white t-shirt social.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Students\u2019 Union is investigating an incident involving behaviour by an individual attending a student group event, which appears to be an unauthorised white t-shirt social, where anti-Semitic language was written on a top.\n\n\"This action is wholly unacceptable and completely against our core values.\n\n\u201cOffensive behaviour that marginalises any group within our community constitutes a breach of the regulations governing student discipline and we have launched an inquiry into this incident through a disciplinary process.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Prince Harry was also criticised for wearing swastika at a fancy dress party.\n\nClarence House swiftly issued a statement from the royal following a backlash in which he apologised for any offence.\n\nIn the statement, the Prince said: \"I am very sorry if I caused any offence or embarrassment to anyone. It was a poor choice of costume and I apologise.\"\n\nRead more\n\nHow to get the best Black Friday deals this year", "description": "A fancy dress shop has been criticised for selling an \u201coffensive\u201d Nazi uniform costume.The \"Gestapo Officer\" outfit, which costs \u00a335, includes a hat, button up shirt, trousers, boots and red armband.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9YSkce8x.MDY3Ldhz7nXGQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1e5af0cdeec9d18161da59ad489ae051", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
