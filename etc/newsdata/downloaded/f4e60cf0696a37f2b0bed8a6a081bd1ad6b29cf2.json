Technical details and its name are still closely-kept secrets, but Ford filed a trademark for the name \u201cMustang Mach E\u201d earlier this year.\n\nFORD'S ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE AWESOME ... FORD EXECUTIVE SAYS\n\nFord\u2019s website dedicated to electric cars says an available configuration will have a range of at least 300 miles per charge, but doesn\u2019t specify which. However, a since-deleted mention in a press release from its charging network partner, Electrify America, said that the number applies to a rear-wheel-drive model with an \u201cextended battery pack,\u201d suggesting a model with a lower range and price will also be offered.\n\nThere\u2019s no word yet on what the price target is, but more information about the vehicle will come at its November debut, about a year before it is scheduled to go on sale.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "The future begins soon.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
