From my more than two decades of experience performing this oversight, I can confirm that our nation\u2019s federal employees deserve our respect, gratitude and support.\n\nAD\n\nWhen people in the leadership of the nation attack our courts, the members of our Congress, our civil servants and our media, they are attacking the glue that holds our diverse nation together as the United States of America.\n\nAD\n\nAnd when these attackers do so on the basis of factually unfounded opinion, rather than verifiable evidence, they are engaged in demagoguery of the most dangerous sort.\n\nThis is why our civil service, committed to maintaining the rule of law and decision-making based on verifiable facts, is so important to maintaining the legitimacy of our government, both elected and appointed.\n\nUnder our democratic republic, elected leaders make policy but must rely on civil servants, appointed on the basis of merit, to implement those public policies. We must rely on the expertise of our merit-based civil service if we wish to have a government that addresses the factual realities of our lives (to the extent that human beings can ever achieve that goal).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis duty to find and implement the truth, as I have mentioned, is the province of our civil servants, whether they serve in Washington; our states; or in the law enforcement agencies of our country. This is not to say that our government agencies always get it right or that they never overreach. Human beings, however talented and well-meaning, make mistakes.\n\nAs citizens of the greatest democratic republic in the world, we have the privilege and duty to recall our nation\u2019s founding and to engage our nation on the basis of those fundamental principles.\n\nI hold fast to this conviction because the functioning \u2014 indeed, the very legitimacy \u2014 of our democratic system has been under attack for some time. I am speaking, of course, of the continuing attacks on our elections \u2014 from sources both foreign and domestic \u2014 and of the failure of too many of my colleagues in Congress and the White House to adequately defend us against those attacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the unity and future of our republic, our Congress must reassert its constitutional obligation of oversight, seeking and obtaining the answers to serious questions of governance that, until now, have gone unanswered. We must perform this constitutional duty so effectively and convincingly that those Americans who support this president and his administration and those who disagree will reach a shared and united answer as to how our nation must proceed.\n\nI remain confident that we can fulfill this historic duty. To succeed, however, we will need our federal civil service and the Americans who serve us there to give us their complete and unbiased cooperation. To the extent that we are required to do so, we will enforce that cooperation through action in our courts, but I sincerely hope that this route will seldom be necessary. Toward this end, I will close with this pledge. In the words of my heroine, former congresswoman Barbara Jordan, from 1974:\n\n\u201cMy faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, [or] the destruction of the Constitution. I hope and trust that all Americans feel \u2014 and will do \u2014 the same.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The duty to find and implement the truth is the province of our civil servants.", "authors": ["Elijah E.
