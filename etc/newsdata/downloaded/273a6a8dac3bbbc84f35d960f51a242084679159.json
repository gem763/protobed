Want a storage drive that comes with a warranty and data recovery service protection? You need to take a look at the ioSafe Solo Hawk.\n\nMust read: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max: What are the differences?\n\nIn an era where external storage drives are sleek and look more like sports cars than peripherals, the ioSafe Solo Hawk stands out by looking, well, like a brick.\n\nA black brick.\n\nAn anodized aluminium brick.\n\nExternally, the Solo Hawk is very basic indeed. It features a single USB-C port compatible with USB 3.2 Gen 2 (and comes with cables to connect to Type-C or Type A ports), a single blue LED indicator, and a slot for a Kensington Lock.\n\nWhat sets the Solo Hawk apart from the competition is its rugged durability. How durable is it? Very durable.\n\nThe Solo Hawk SSD is tested to military specifications, and can survive the following:\n\nA 10-foot drop\n\n3 days, complete immersion in 10 feet of saltwater or fresh water (no cap required on the USB-C port)\n\nTotal immersion in 12-feet of diesel fuel, oils, hydraulic fluids, aircraft fuels, for an hour\n\nCrushing pressures of 2500 pounds\n\nRain, freezing rain, blowing dust and sand, salt fog, UV, and ice\n\nHigh-altitude operations up to 30,000 feet\n\nIn case things go wrong, the drive comes with a two-year hardware warranty complete with data recovery service protection.\n\nAbout the only thing the Solo Hawk can't handle is fire. If you need fire protection you need to look at other products in the ioSafe line, such as the SoloPRO, which can survive 1550\u00b0F for 1/2 hour.\n\nI've had the opportunity to test a Solo Hawk now for over a week and I'm impressed by its durability. I've thrown it. Jumped on it. Driven over it. Left it outdoors for a few nights in the rain and cold. Tossed it around the beach. Almost lost it to King Neptune in the sea.\n\nAnd it still works. More than that, it still looks pretty much like new, barring a few cosmetic battle scars.\n\nOn the performance front, the Solo Hawk OK, but not blazing fast by any accounts, with tested read and write speeds of 508 and 470 MB/s respectively. More than adequate for most needs unless you're in the business of handling 4K video.\n\nThe Solo Hawk is compatible with Windows 8.1 or greater, and macOS 10.12 or greater, and comes in 500GB and 1TB capacities, priced at $319 and $399 respectively, available for purchase from Amazon.com.\n\nA great storage drive,\n\nFor more information, visit ioSafe.\n\nSee also:", "description": "Want an external drive that can take a serious beating and still keep your data safe?
