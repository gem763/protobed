He can log 100 miles shuttling between conflict zones and the outlying apartment towers where many protesters live.\n\nHe\u2019s part of what\u2019s known as \u201cthe school bus\u201d\u2014code for a vast underground of getaway cars typically driven by older, middle-class Hong Kongers who want to support the younger generation protesting in the streets. One of the encrypted chat groups organizing the rides, also called \u201cafter school pickup,\u201d connects drivers it calls \u201cparents\u201d with protester \u201cchildren.\u201d The group has some 21,000 subscribers. Tens of thousands more subscribe to other groups.\n\nMainland China and its handpicked leaders in Hong Kong have argued that a silent majority of citizens opposes the demonstrators who have confronted police, blocked roads and disrupted airport travel during a summer of protests against Beijing\u2019s tightening grip. A closer look suggests a vast swath of the city is quietly helping to keep it going.\n\nLargely out of the public eye, behind-the-scenes supporters have sprung up across Hong Kong to furnish protesters with rides home, gas masks, food money and funds for legal defense. There\u2019s a doctors group offering anonymous examinations to injured protesters wary of being treated at public hospitals. Another group offers to listen to young protesters who don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about what they are going through with their own parents.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to face it alone,\u201d the group advertises in protester chat rooms. Its administrator goes by @cometomama.\n\nSince June, activists have raised roughly $10 million in small donations to pay protester legal fees and medical bills. The fund is called the \u201c612 Humanitarian Relief Fund\u201d after the date of fierce clashes when some protesters were charged with crimes that can carry a sentence up to 10 years, according to Margaret Ng, one of its organizers.\n\n\u201cIt is significant because it shows how many people in Hong Kong want to show their support in some way but can\u2019t get out and protest,\u201d said Ms. Ng, 71, a prominent Hong Kong lawyer who served years in its legislature.\n\nA protester threw tear gas aside at an August demonstration.

The first of these were timed to hit during the Group of 20 meeting in Japan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just neighbors getting together to do what we can,\u201d said Mr. Chan, the ride-giver, who said he wants to protect the future of Hong Kong for his own child. As he spoke by telephone, \u201cStand With Hong Kong,\u201d a nightly 10 p.m. cheer for the protests, echoed from the balconies of nearby towers. \u201cWe are like intersecting social circles that overlap and overlap until we reach the goal, like a human chain.\u201d\n\nThe public got a glimpse of the size of that chain early this month. When authorities shut down public transport links to Hong Kong\u2019s remote airport and left protesters there stranded, so many drivers responded to pleas for rides that they snarled traffic on a major highway. Hours into the rescue, there were more drivers than protesters. Some cars went home empty.\n\nThis support helps explain the durability of a movement that deepened this summer in opposition to a law allowing extraditions to China. The protests have persisted while police stepped up arrests and unleashed water cannons to restore order.\n\nThe support also undercuts arguments circulated by Beijing that the protests are sustained by provocateurs from the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nMask filters provided by Mr. Ko last weekend.

They also fear mainland China could target them for retribution. Already, Beijing has pressured companies such as Hong Kong\u2019s flagship airline Cathay Pacific to fire suspected protest supporters or participants.\n\nMany come from the comfortable sectors of Hong Kong society. Take a housewife with long hair and a prominent diamond studded wedding band who asked to be called Mrs. D, the initial of one of her names. She lives in the city\u2019s Kowloon Tong neighborhood, a posh enclave long home to Hong Kong\u2019s privileged, including the late actor Bruce Lee.\n\n\u201cYou can print that I live in Kowloon Tong,\u201d she said. \u201cI want people to know that people like me are supporting the movement.\u201d\n\nSome nights after following the skirmishes on TV, she goes out to make school bus runs with her husband in their luxury sedan. She first checks in with one of the \u201cschool bus\u201d channels on the anonymous messaging app Telegram that connects drivers and protesters using lightly veiled codes.\n\n\u201cHave all the children gotten home yet?\u201d asked the administrator of one school bus group around 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 7, a night of violent showdowns in the Mong Kok neighborhood. \u201cIf anyone would like us to pick you up from school today. If anyone wants a ride home, contact admin,\u201d the group repeated at 2 a.m.\n\nIn July, Mrs. D was moved by reports that some young protesters weren\u2019t eating much during the long days and nights scuffling with police. The student-aged protesters often don\u2019t have enough money for transportation, gear like helmets and food. Some parents cut off their allowances to keep them from going out, she said.\n\nMr. Chan, who gives rides to protesters, watched the crowd from an overhead walkway during last weekend\u2019s protest. Photo: Fitz Suen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Mrs. D collected $25,000 worth of McDonald\u2019s gift certificates and prepaid metro cards largely by hitting up neighbors.\n\nMany protesters are ashamed to accept donations, she said, so she and her friends decided to present them as \u201cgifts from an aunt.\u201d They staple the coupons into packs with handwritten notes and little hearts. Mrs. D said she hand delivers coupons to protesters she met at rallies or through encrypted chats. The protesters redistribute the coupons through networks of their own.\n\n\u201cYou are not alone,\u201d read one note. \u201cWe are giving you our energy.\u201d\n\nSome money has come available for arrested protesters who choose to flee, according to two protesters who were offered money and two donors who know about the practice. The protesters, who fear long prison terms, typically have fled to Taiwan.\n\nMajor logistical efforts go into providing front-line protesters with the gear they use to protect themselves from tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons and less-lethal projectiles like bean bags deployed since the demonstrations began.\n\nA full set of gear\u2014respirator masks and filters from 3M , yellow construction helmets from Korel, goggles and gloves\u2014can cost $50 or more. Replacing top-of-the-line air filters on a mask after heavy use can cost between $22 and $35.\n\nThe equipment is difficult to find anymore in Hong Kong\u2019s shops but is in ample supply in the streets. It is common at protest staging areas to see stacks of helmets still in their plastic wrapping or boxes of shop goggles left out for the taking.\n\nInto the Fray How Hong Kong protesters equip themselves for confrontations with police Goggles Basic, $3.

There is an organization behind it.\u201d\n\nA supporter who called himself Mr. Ko, a top regional executive at a global company, said he spends much of his spare time acquiring and distributing such gear.\n\nHe is part of an informal group of around 100 people connected through Telegram who share information about sourcing, shipping and distribution. They import the gear from Taiwan, where they believe suppliers would never give their names to police.\n\n\u201cWe only buy a few sets each, to stay under the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we each buy five, that\u2019s 500 sets.\u201d\n\nMr. Chan carries a \u2018protester support\u2019 card, which lists an emergency hotline, what to do if arrested and protesters\u2019 legal rights. Photo: Fitz Suen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAn engineer in his mid-30s whose surname is Cheung brings in far more. He works at a construction site, so he has a plausible reason to buy gear in bulk. Right now he said he has six boxes of full-face 3M gas masks stacked at the site ready for the next big march.\n\nHe stays connected via membership in a recommendation-only chat group of engineers\u2014many groups require an existing member to vouch for a new one to fend off police infiltrators. The group discusses buying gear and other engineering topics, including possibly using carbon fiber to make lightweight shields for the protesters.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What should the government in Hong Kong do to address protesters\u2019 demands? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Ko delivers the gear to protesters that he knows a few days before a demonstration. \u201cI tell parents it\u2019s similar to what you face with kids and sex,\u201d Mr. Ko said. \u201cYou know they are going to do it anyway, so you give them protection. We know they are going to protest, so let\u2019s give them protection.\u201d\n\nMr. Ko believes the protesters prefer a more expensive model of air filter for their masks in part because of the model\u2019s striking hot pink color. \u201cThey really want the pink ones, so we get it for them,\u201d he said.\n\nOlder Hong Kongers supported past protests, too. They supplied food, tents and aid during a 79-day sit-in by students demanding democracy in 2014.\n\nTheir support is more active now, said Chris, a trim man in his mid-50s who owns a logistics and shipping business. Back in 2014, he made the local news for carrying wood planks in his business suit after work to help build desks so school-age protesters could continue their studies.\n\nNow he said he often stands very near where the masked protesters are confronting police, in part to see if they need anything.\n\n\u201cI feel I owe these kids a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nChris joined a demonstration at the British Consulate-General last weekend. Photo: Fitz Suen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHis parents fled mainland China after the Communist Revolution with nothing, and built new lives in what was then a British colony. The U.K. returned the territory to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement that promised Hong Kong a measure of autonomy until 2047.\n\nThat arrangement was challenged this year by a proposed law allowing extradition to China. The bill, which followed a number of other erosions of Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law, sparked the current protests. Chris saw it as the death of one country, two systems and Hong Kong\u2019s way of life.\n\n\u201cThis is a fight about freedom and democracy versus authoritarianism and communism,\u201d he said.\n\nOn June 12, when tens of thousands of protesters massed outside the legislative building to prevent lawmakers from passing the bill, he went, too.\n\nExpecting police to disperse the crowd with pepper spray, he went from store to store buying every umbrella he could to be used as shields. He purchased at least fifty and sometimes paid just half price, which he said reflects the level of local support.\n\nThe legislators were forced to suspend the vote on the law, and a summer of confrontation kicked into high gear.\n\nMargaret Ng, shown in 2017, organized a fund of roughly $10 million in donations to pay protesters\u2019 legal fees and medical bills.

Chris said he forged links with a representative of one of these teams and basically adopted them. From there he met others. He provides them money to buy protective gear, food and other things they need.\n\nOf all the methods of support, the school bus brings the older generation of supporters into closest proximity with the young protesters. Sometimes it unites father and son.\n\nA 23-year-old accounting school graduate called Tim sometimes goes out on late night school bus runs with his father after making it home from protesting himself. His father drives while Tim assures the protesters his middle-aged dad isn\u2019t a cop.\n\n\u201cThis experience has drawn us together,\u201d he said.\n\nThe school bus started because protesters needed ways to get from marches on Hong Kong island back to their homes on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour. It has become more important now that authorities are shutting metro stations early, leaving protesters wandering the streets and vulnerable to arrest.\n\nPolice used blue dye in water cannons against protesters last weekend. Photo: nicolas asfouri/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nA protester called Desmond first asked for a free school bus ride on July 21, after word spread that protesters had been beaten in a subway station. He was running from club-wielding police that night in the city and needed to get back across the harbor. He asked the anonymous administrator of one of the school bus chat rooms to help him.\n\nThe administrator told him to go to an address on the edge of noisy bar district, where a bunch of cars waiting around wouldn\u2019t attract attention. Desmond found 20 cars lined up, their drivers calling out destinations such as \u201cWest Kowloon!\u201d and \u201cEast Kowloon!\u201d\n\nOnce a driver picks up a protester, the intergenerational chitchat is kept to a minimum, said Mr. Chan.\n\n\u201cIf you start talking too much and asking questions, they start to get nervous that you are a cop,\u201d he said. \u201cI just drive and let them off wherever they want.\u201d\n\nWrite to John Lyons at john.lyons@wsj.com", "description": "The quiet backing of older, professional locals helps explain the longevity of the youth-led movement.
