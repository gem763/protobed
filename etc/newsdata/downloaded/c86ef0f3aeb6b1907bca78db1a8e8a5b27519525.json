Andrew Cuomo Takes Executive Action To Ban Flavored E-Cigarettes", "language": "en", "text": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is taking emergency executive action to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in the state amid a national investigation by health officials into hundreds of cases of lung illness and six deaths that may be related to vaping.\n\n\u201cNew York is confronting this crisis head-on and today we are taking another nation-leading step to combat a public health emergency,\u201d the governor said Sunday during a press conference to announce the measure, calling out manufacturers of the products for \u201cintentionally and recklessly targeting young people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, unscrupulous stores are knowingly selling vaping products to underage youth \u2015 those retailers are now on notice that we are ramping up enforcement and they will be caught and prosecuted,\u201d he added.\n\nAcross the state, 64 cases of lung illness associated with vaping have been reported as of Friday, according to Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker.\n\nOn Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its latest figures on the outbreak of lung disease. Thirty-six states and one U.S. territory have reported a total of 380 cases in which people using vape pens and e-cigarettes for marijuana and nicotine have been affected.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kansas became the latest state to confirm its first vaping-linked death, following California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Oregon.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the Food and Drug Administration should consider banning flavored e-cigarettes, telling reporters that \u201cvery strong action\u201d may be required to protect the public.\n\nThough the FDA is still developing its final guidance on the matter, Cuomo expressed frustration that the federal government is not moving more quickly, emphasizing that the \u201cpolitical influence of these companies is not to be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not relying or waiting for the federal government. I don\u2019t expect them to do anything responsibly, to act responsibly, because I\u2019ve never seen them act responsibly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo our destiny is in our own hands, and we\u2019re taking action.\u201d", "description": "The move comes amid a national investigation into hundreds of cases of lung illness and six deaths associated with vaping.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7e7813240000d3267b2374.jpeg?cache=vtybrhr29f&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
