The great thing about our boys is they don\u2019t give up,\u201d Wales coach Warren Gatland said.\n\nLater, millions of home fans will tune in for Sunday\u2019s second quarter-final as hosts Japan bid to upset the odds once again against South Africa.\n\nThe Brave Blossoms\u2019 run has captured the Japanese imagination, with nearly 55 million watching their scintillating win over Scotland as they topped their pool, organisers said.\n\nNow Japan are hoping they can add to their wins over Ireland and Scotland and topple the mighty Springboks \u2014 as they did in their \u201cMiracle of Brighton\u201d victory in 2015, one of rugby\u2019s greatest shocks.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Play for pride\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of support, especially from Japan,\u201d said assistant coach Tony Brown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the amount of people that have got on the Japan bandwagon. The amount of people watching every game and supporting us in Japan has been amazing.\u201d\n\nLong queues for replica shirts and endless repeats of Japan\u2019s wins on TV are testament to the growing excitement around the team.\n\nHowever, they remain heavy underdogs against an imposing South Africa side, who have set out to bully the Japanese with their massive pack and by naming six forwards among their eight replacements on the bench.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll definitely lose if I go head-on,\u201d conceded scrum-half Yutaka Nagare.\n\n\u201cI have to use my technique given I\u2019m small. The try (Finn) Russell scored in the Scotland game started off with my mistake so I really felt responsible, and I feel they\u2019ll look to attack me in the next game, as well as near the try-line.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve decided to go in determined to play with pride for this team. I\u2019ll keep my mind strong. I\u2019ll take them on carrying both mind and technique.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s ultra-fast, accurate handling and lightning pace created four highlight-reel tries against Scotland as they won 28-21 to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nSouth Africa defence coach Jacques Nienaber said it was a \u201cnice challenge\u201d to work out how to nullify the attacking threat of a side crafted by former All Black Jamie Joseph.\n\n\u201cThey play a certain style and to their strengths, and they utilise their wings a lot. Their wings won\u2019t typically stay on their sides so the style would incorporate them in attack on both sides -\u2013 they both work off their touchlines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut again it does pose weaknesses as well. If you concede turnovers and both your wingers are on one edge, it means you don\u2019t have pace on the other edge.\n\n\u201cSo, it does have its benefits. But, like in anything in rugby, for any benefit there is also a counter.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Wales scrambled into the Rugby World Cup semi-finals with a nail-biting 20-19 win over 14-man France on Sunday, as Japanese fans", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/aa944e_flanker-aaron-wainwright-scored-try-in-wales-wales-taste-revenge-france-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
