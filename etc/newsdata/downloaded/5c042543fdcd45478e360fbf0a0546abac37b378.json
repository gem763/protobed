You realise you have the wifi password saved on your laptop, but not on whatever device you\u2019re looking to connect. And you\u2019re either too lazy to ask for the password again, or you have no way to acquire it in your present condition.\n\nWhat do you do? Easy. Pull out your laptop and look it up. Here\u2019s how.\n\nWindows\n\nTo find a saved wifi password, you have a few options. First, you can pull up a Command Prompt and type in this somewhat-complicated string:\n\nnetsh wlan show profile [NAME OF YOUR WIFI NETWORK] key=clear\n\nYou\u2019ll want to replace the [NAME OF YOUR WIFI NETWORK] part with, well, the name of whatever SSID you\u2019ve connected to. When you do, and hit Enter, you\u2019ll see the password for said wifi network in the \u201cKey Content\u201d listing of the Security settings field\u2014it should be pretty apparent.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIf you\u2019d like to try another way, you can pull up your passwords via the Windows 10 Settings app. Launch it, click on Network & Internet, scroll down a bit and click on Network and Sharing Centre, click on the blue \u201cWi-Fi\u201d link next to the \u201cConnections:\u201d field, click on \u201cWireless Properties,\u201d click on the Security tab, and select \u201cShow characters.\u201d\n\nThere are other utilities you can try to get your passwords in an even simpler manner, but I should note that Windows Defender might not like them very much. At least, that was the case when I tried downloading Nirsoft\u2019s WirelessKeyView\u2014surely a harmless program, but one that makes Windows Defender freak out once it finishes transferring to your system.\n\nMac\n\nOn macOS, revealing up a saved wifi password is simple. First, you can pull up Terminal and type in the following:\n\nsecurity find-generic-password -wa [NAME OF YOUR WIFI NETWORK]\n\nSame deal as before: Replace [NAME OF YOUR WIFI NETWORK] with exactly what it says. You\u2019ll next have to authenticate into your system as an administrator, but once you do that, the password for whatever wifi network you typed in should appear within Terminal.\n\nYou can also just dig through Keychain\u2014specifically, the Keychain Access application\u2014to sniff out a saved password. Launch the application and click on the System Keychain in the upper-left corner. Find the wifi network you want to look up and double-click on it.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nWhen you do, you\u2019ll see a box that looks like the following. Click \u201cShow Password\u201d to do just that\u2014after you authenticate yourself, of course.", "description": "Riddle me this: You\u2019re out somewhere and you need to hop on a wifi network with a new device.
