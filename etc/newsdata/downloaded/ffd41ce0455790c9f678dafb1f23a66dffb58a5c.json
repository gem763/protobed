Now, though, the lessons Microsoft learned the hard way are making its life easier.\n\nThe Axios-Harris Poll 100 survey found that companies untouched by scandal \u2014 including Microsoft \u2014 prospered in the eyes of consumers, while those companies most heavily affected by privacy-related scandals faced the steepest erosion in trust.\n\nReproduced from The Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, 2019; Chart: Axios Visuals\n\nBetween the lines: Microsoft has opted for a steady, methodical approach to thorny issues around consumer data, user-generated content, AI ethics and inequality produced by the industry's massive success. For example:\n\nMicrosoft took a systematic course to developing AI principles for product development, including how and when to work on military projects. Meanwhile, Google's case-by-case approach has been mired in controversy. It has called on Congress to regulate facial recognition, saying the government needs to proactively manage the use of the technology. Microsoft execs supported federal privacy rules before other tech companies got on board. The company pledged $500 million for affordable housing in Seattle in an acknowledgement of the role tech companies have played in making their hometowns too expensive for many workers. The company also launched an initiative to connect 3 million rural Americans to broadband.\n\nMicrosoft isn't doing these things altruistically \u2014 there are clear business and competitive reasons for these strategies. But it has jumped on them earlier, allowing it to get ahead of problems and handle them better politically.\n\nMicrosoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith is quick to acknowledge that Microsoft made a lot of mistakes in the '90s, and it continues to make them.\n\nis quick to acknowledge that Microsoft made a lot of mistakes in the '90s, and it continues to make them. Part of the process of managing society's changing views of the tech industry is being able to make tough decisions, he said earlier this year during a conversation at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters.\n\nof managing society's changing views of the tech industry is being able to make tough decisions, he said earlier this year during a conversation at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters. \"Maybe we're able to make some of those decisions around here because we were the first graduate of the school of hard knocks,\" he said. \"We graduated first \u2014 not necessarily first in our class, but it was the first class.\"\n\nThe software giant isn't without its own headaches. Most recently, CEO Satya Nadella added resources to the company's HR operation after complaints of sexual harassment went public. Like other tech companies, it's dealt with challenges around workforce diversity. And it has come under fire both for its decision to do business in China and for its willingness to work with the U.S. military.\n\nBut it hasn't stumbled into major scandals. Plus, its platform wasn't specifically targeted by foreign actors interfering in recent elections. So its executives haven't been hauled up to testify before Congress.\n\ninto major scandals.

And unlike many Silicon Valley execs who avoid Washington, Smith makes frequent trips to meet with policymakers.\n\nwho avoid Washington, Smith makes frequent trips to meet with policymakers. As reported by The Information, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg approached Smith for advice on rebuilding trust.\n\nNadella and Smith, who have both worked at Microsoft for more than 25 years and lived through the antitrust battle, have a unique relationship in that they each drive crucial strategic areas: Nadella is focused primarily on product and business growth while Smith spearheads policy, legal issues and public affairs.\n\nOur thought bubble: Per Axios' Ina Fried, Microsoft is often at the forefront of the technology and the discussion in an area, but slow to capitalize on a trend. It's rarely first with products, and even rarer with a first successful product.\n\nFor example, Bill Gates laid out all the technologies that would lead to the iPad years before it was ready (or possible), and yet it was Apple that built the first successful tablet.\n\nThe big picture: The company has experienced its own cultural shift since its antitrust battle 20 years ago. Previous CEOs Gates and Steve Ballmer took a more adversarial approach to competitors, such as targeting Google with ad campaigns or trading barbs with Apple.\n\nNadella, who became CEO 5 years ago, said he doesn't see the point in bashing other business models. It doesn't hurt that Microsoft is one of the world's most valuable companies along with Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.\n\n\"I'd better make sure that a lot of the world succeeds, because that's the only way for Microsoft to succeed.\"\n\n\u2014 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella", "description": "How it has sidestepped the mistakes made by its younger, brasher Big Tech brethren.", "authors": ["Kim Hart", "Alexi Mccammond", "Fadel Allassan", "Orion Rummler", "Dan Primack", "Rashaan Ayesh"], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/05veJI-dGLAK8JPTfv1KvQ-2W2A=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/04/23/1556038709918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-24"}
