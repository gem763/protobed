Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng legislature,\" Bloom said.\n\n\"According to Masuku, 'all facilities audited received either a non-compliance finding, such as a contravention and/or improvement compliance notice and fire contravention.'\"\n\nHowever, Masuku said the safety of both staff and patients is a key focus area for the department, and ensuring compliance will help achieve improved health outcomes.\n\n\"The department has set for itself an annual target of ensuring 100% administrative OHS compliance,\" Masuku said.\n\n\"The 2019/20 first quarter performance of the department shows that we are currently at 55%, which is on course with attaining 100% by the end of the financial year.\"\n\nMasuku said the department is committed in ensuring that all its facilities are 100% compliant with OHS by the end of the 2019/20 financial year.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
