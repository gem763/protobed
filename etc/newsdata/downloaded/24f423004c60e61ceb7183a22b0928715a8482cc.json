This effectively means lenders are charged for holding idle cash.\n\nSewing targeted the ECB in his speech, saying the central bank's push into negative rates runs contrary to expert opinion.\n\n\"Very few economists believe that cheaper money at this level will have an effect,\" Sewing said, adding that this view has been echoed by Deutsche Bank's own clients. \"They will not invest an additional euro just because the loan will be an additional 10 basis points cheaper.\"\n\nSewing's comments come as the lender embarks on a huge restructuring program that pulls it out of the global equities business, sees 18,000 jobs slashed, and places a stronger emphasis on transaction banking for corporate clients.", "description": "Global central banks are running out of measures to \"cushion\" the blow of waning growth, Deutsche Bank's CEO said.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105245201-RTS1SZG9.jpg?v=1543353715", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
