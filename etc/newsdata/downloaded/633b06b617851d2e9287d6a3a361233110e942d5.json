The Georgians provided a genuine contest, making 128 tackles in the first half to put up a defensive wall as the Wallabies struggled to translate an attacking game plan in slippery conditions.\n\nA solo try from winger Marika Koroibete was a highlight on the hour, and put the Australians out of reach of an upset loss to the Georgians.\n\nAlexander Todua sprinted into the corner to score Georgia\u2019s only try in the 70th minute, but the Australians responded with two tries in the last five minutes to flanker Jack Dempsey and replacement scrumhalf Will Genia.\n\n__\n\n8:10 p.m.\n\nAn error-prone Australia is leading 10-3 at halftime after struggling in slippery conditions against a committed Georgia in the Pool D game at Shizuoka.\n\nThe two-time World Cup winner was expected to be further ahead but was hampered by poor handling in the wet and finished the half with 14 men after No. 8 Isi Naisarani was yellow-carded for a shoulder-led contact with the head of Georgia veteran Mamuka Gorgodze in the 35th minute.\n\nAustralia scored the only try when scrumhalf Nic White burrowed over in the 22nd minute. Matt Toomua landed the conversion and added a penalty goal in the 38th.\n\nSoso Matiashvili scored Georgia\u2019s points with a penalty goal in the 28th.\n\n___\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nUruguay has made nine changes to the starting lineup that lost to Australia for its last Pool D match against Wales on Sunday in Kumamoto.\n\nTight forwards German Kessler, Diego Arbelo, and Manuel Leindekar, and backs Felipe Berchesi, Nicolas Freitas and Andres Vilaseca are the only players who repeat as starters.\n\nOf the six, all but Arbelo are making their fourth start in the tournament.\n\nCenters Vilaseca and Juan Manuel Gaminara will be making a team record eighth Rugby World Cup appearance. Agustin Ormaechea and Rodrigo Silva could join them if they come off the bench.\n\nUruguay has beaten Fiji and lost to Georgia and Australia so far.\n\nLineup: Gaston Mieres, Leandro Leivas, Juan Manuel Cat, Andres Vilaseca, Nicolas Freitas, Felipe Berchesi, Santiago Arata; Alejandro Nieto, Santiago Civetta, Juan Manuel Gaminara (captain), Manuel Leindekar, Ignacio Dotti, Diego Arbelo, German Kessler, Mateo Sanguinetti. Reserves: Guillermo Pujadas, Juan Echeverria, Juan Pedro Rombys, Diego Magno, Manuel Diana, Agustin Ormaechea, Tomas Inciarte, Rodrigo Silva.\n\n___\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nIreland has concerns over the state of the playing field at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium for Saturday\u2019s Pool A match against Samoa.\n\nThe pitch was recently re-laid and the Irish found during Friday\u2019s final practice that it appears to cut up too easily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been given all assurances by World Rugby that it\u2019s safe to play on and that\u2019s all we can ask for \u2026 I trust the pitch will do its job,\u201d Ireland scrum coach Greg Feek said. \u201cWhen it comes to a symmetric position, where there\u2019s a couple of big packs going at it, you\u2019re always going to be a bit cautious and ask the questions.\u201d\n\nOne of the main worries for the two burly forward packs will be having a stable base and not losing footing easily.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always my concern, whether it\u2019s in training or on the pitch,\u201d Feek said. \u201cMake sure the scrums stay up; not just for safety but for the game itself.\u201d\n\nBack-rower CJ Stander starts the match at No. 8 for Ireland and he spoke of the terrain\u2019s inconsistency, particularly in the way the surface was re-laid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually good grass, it\u2019s just not stable on a few points. It\u2019s actually A-grade grass, it\u2019s just how they put it down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just needs a bit more time, there\u2019s nothing we can do about that now. When you get to open space to run into, it\u2019s actually not that bad.\u201d\n\nThat open space is where veteran winger Keith Earls hopes to get his first try of the tournament.\n\nHe was not overly impressed by the pitch during the captain\u2019s run but said it looks worse than it probably is.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look great to be honest, but when you\u2019re out there it\u2019s quite flat and firm and doesn\u2019t feel too bad to run on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to get on with the job.\u201d\n\n___\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nWith one of the pool stage\u2019s most anticipated games at the mercy of a typhoon, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend is preparing for the must-win encounter with host Japan with the expectation it\u2019s going ahead on Sunday.\n\nIf Ireland beats Samoa on Saturday, Scotland will need to beat Japan to qualify for the next stage.\n\nJapan is 3-0, including an upset win over the Irish. Scotland opened with a heavy loss to Ireland, but has recovered to win its next two games with bonus points.\n\nTownsend made 12 changes to his starting lineup for the Pool A showdown scheduled for Yokohama, recalling seven players to the starting XV who were rested for the midweek win over Russia.\n\nForwards Allan Dell, Jonny Gray, Blade Thomson and backs Greig Laidlaw, Finn Russell, Sam Johnson and Stuart Hogg are returning fresh. Only Fraser Brown, Darcy Graham and Tommy Seymour are in the starting XV for back-to-back games.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game at Yokohama between England and France was cancelled because of concerns over the impact of Typhoon Hagibis, and so was New Zealand\u2019s game against Italy in Toyota.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the game in Yokohama being canceled, with the most destructive typhoon of the season expected to hit late Saturday.\n\nScotland rugby officials have confirmed they\u2019re contemplating legal action against World Rugby if the game is canceled and Scotland is deprived of a chance to play for a quarterfinal spot.\n\nScotland: Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Darcy Graham, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw (captain); Blade Thomson, Jamie Ritchie, Magnus Bradbury, Jonny Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Willem Nel, Fraser Brown, Allan Dell. Reserves: Stuart McInally, Gordon Reid, Zander Fagerson, Scott Cummings, Ryan Wilson, George Horne, Pete Horne, Blair Kinghorn.\n\n___\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nCheslin Kolbe sat out a Springboks training session on Friday and coach Rassie Erasmus says the exciting wing is \u201cstill nursing\u201d a twisted left ankle from the win over Italy a week ago.\n\nKolbe was meant to be back in action by now but his recovery is going slower than expected. Erasmus said there\u2019s an 80-90% chance Kolbe will be back in full training on Monday. South Africa still has nine days prep time before the quarterfinals.\n\nLoose forward Francois Louw and scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies also missed training.\n\nLouw has a few bumps and bruises and a swollen knee, Erasmus said, and was \u201cat that age where after every game, he takes a little bit longer (to recover).\u201d\n\nJantjies might be the biggest worry. The backup scrumhalf has a hamstring strain and Erasmus was asked if he was considering calling a new No. 9 into the squad. Erasmus said not yet but he was \u201ca little bit nervous\u201d over the youngster.\n\nThe Springboks were back on the training field after getting two days off to explore Japan, and Erasmus said they were slow getting back to business.\n\n\u201cYou could see in the training session, in the first 5-10 minutes, they were still switched off a bit,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nTonga captain Siale Piutau says he\u2019s retiring from international rugby after the game against the United States on Sunday. It\u2019ll also be his 34th birthday.\n\nPiutau made the announcement in front of reporters as Tonga named its team for its last match in Japan.\n\nHe says it\u2019s so he can spend more time with his family: \u201cI\u2019ve been away three months and my kids are at an age when I think it\u2019s important to have a father figure at home.\u201d\n\nPiutau will continue to play for English club Bristol. The center has 42 test caps for Tonga and has been to three Rugby World Cups. He was part of the Tonga team that beat France at the 2011 World Cup.\n\nTonga will go all out against the U.S. to take a victory away from this World Cup. The last time the Tongans failed to win a game at the tournament was 2003.\n\nPiutau says, \u201cI\u2019m not putting the focus on myself but I want to leave the team on a high, that\u2019s my priority.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nUnited States captain Blaine Scully has been selected to play his 11th Rugby World Cup game and equal the U.S. record.\n\nScully leads a team with three changes for the last Pool C game against Tonga in Osaka on Sunday.\n\nThe three switches are Nick Civetta in for Nate Brakeley at lock, Malon Al-Jiboori in for Hanco Germishuys at flanker, and Will Hooley in for Mike Te\u2019o at fullback. Hooley returns after sustaining a concussion in the Americans\u2019 opening game against England.\n\nThe U.S. lost 45-7 to England, 33-9 to France and 47-17 to Argentina in a tough pool. Tonga is the U.S.\u2019 best chance of a first World Cup win since 2011.\n\nUnited States: Will Hooley, Blaine Scully (captain), Bryce Campbell, Paul Lasike, Marcel Brache, AJ MacGinty, Ruben de Haas; Cam Dolan, Malon Al-Jiboori, Tony Lamborn, Nick Civetta, Greg Peterson, Titi Lamositele, Joe Taufete\u2019e, Eric Fry. Reserves: James Hilterbrand, Olive Kilifi,, Paul Mullen, Ben Landry, Hanco Germishuys, Ben Pinkelman, Nate Augspurger, Mike Te\u2019o.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nStar wing Kenki Fukuoka finally starts for Japan in the quarterfinal decider against Scotland on Sunday in Yokohama after he tore a calf muscle five weeks ago.\n\nFukuoka was a late, forced inclusion in the reserves against Ireland and scored the match-winning try, and scored another try off the bench against Samoa last Saturday. He\u2019s back as a starter among four changes to the starting lineup.\n\nHooker Shota Horie, lock Luke Thompson, and fullback William Tupou are recalled.\n\nFukuoka, Horie, and Thompson, along with prop Keita Inagaki, captain Michael Leitch, flyhalf Yu Tamura and wing Kotaro Matsushima repeat as starters against Scotland from the 2015 Rugby World Cup match which the Scots won 45-10 to cost Japan a place in the quarterfinals.\n\nJapan: William Tupou, Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, Kenki Fukuoka, Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Kazuki Himeno, Pieter Labuschagne, Michael Leitch (captain), James Moore, Luke Thompson, Jiwon Koo, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki. Reserves: Atsushi Sakate, Isileli Nakajima, Asaeli Ai Valu, Uwe Helu, Hendrik Tui, Fumiaki Tanaka, Rikiya Matsuda, Ryohei Yamanaka.\n\n___\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nNew Zealand lock Sam Whitelock has sympathized with Italy captain Sergio Parisse blasting Rugby World Cup organizers for their pool match being cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis without a backup plan.\n\nParisse believed Italy was disrespected, and their match in Toyota scheduled for Saturday when the typhoon should hit, would not have been cancelled if the defending champion All Blacks needed the points to reach the quarterfinals. Italy missed out.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn\u2019t news that typhoons hit Japan,\u201d Parisse said on Friday. \u201cWe had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team. The alternative is Plan B. When you organize a World Cup you should have one in place. Sure, if Italy and New Zealand decide they don\u2019t want to play then fine, but if New Zealand needed the points, it wouldn\u2019t have been cancelled.\u201d\n\nWhitelock, who has never been in a typhoon, understood where Parisse was coming from.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of frustration coming out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitelock has dealt with cancelled games before, when Crusaders Super Rugby home matches in Christchurch were called off in 2011 because of the deadly earthquake, and last March after the deadly Mosque shootings.\n\n\u201cIn both instances you understand why,\u201d Whitelock said.\n\n\u201cRugby\u2019s just a small thing. We tend to get carried away with it a little bit, we\u2019re so passionate about rugby, and we always want to go out and play, but sometimes the right thing is not playing. There would be nothing worse than if we did play and people were getting hurt.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nJust five days after being hammered by South Africa, Canada limited its changes to five for its last pool match against Namibia on Sunday in Kamaishi.\n\nLoosehead prop Djustice Sears-Duru comes out of the reserves, Eric Howard is at hooker, and Conor Keys replaces Kyle Baillie at lock in the forwards.\n\nGordon McRorie displaces Phil Mack at scrumhalf, and Pat Parfrey is at fullback with Andrew Coe in the reserves.\n\nCanada is on a 10-match winless streak in Rugby World Cups dating to 2011.\n\nNamibia is trying to win its first World Cup match ever, after 22 straight defeats over 20 years.\n\nCanada: Pat Parfrey, Jeff Hassler, Conor Trainor, Ciaran Hearn, DTH van der Merwe, Peter Nelson, Gordon McRorie; Tyler Ardron (captain), Matt Heaton, Lucas Rumball, Conor Keys, Evan Olmstead, Jake Ilnicky, Eric Howard, Djustice Sears-Duru. Reserves: Andrew Quattrin, Hubert Buydens, Matt Tierney, Luke Campbell, Dustin Dobravsky, Jamie Mackenzie, Shane O\u2019Leary, Andrew Coe.\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nCoach Toutai Kefu has made three changes to his starting lineup as Tonga seeks to end its Rugby World Cup with a win.\n\nTighthead prop Siua Halanukonuka and wings Viliami Lolohea and \u2018Ateli Pakalani are into the team against the United States in Osaka on Sunday.\n\nFlanker Sione Kalamafoni and captain Siale Piutau will also set a new Tonga record by appearing in their 12th Rugby World Cup games.\n\nTonga has lost to England, Argentina and France in Pool C. The United States is also winless in three games in Japan.\n\nTonga and the U.S. last met in 2016, a 20-17 win for Tonga. Tonga has won eight of their nine meetings.\n\nTonga: Telusa Veainu, \u2018Atieli Pakalani, Malietoa Hingano, Siale Piutau (captain), Viliami Lolohea, James Faiva, Sonatane Takulua; Maama Vaipulu, Zane Kapeli, Sione Kalamafoni, Halaleva Fifita, Sam Lousi, Siua Halanukonuka, Paula Ngauamo, Siegfried Fisi\u2019ihoi. Reserves: Siua Maile, Vunipola Fifita, Ma\u2019afu Fia, Dan Faleafa, Nasi Manu, Leon Fukofuka, Latiume Fosita, David Halaifonua.\n\n___\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nFlanker Justin Tipuric will captain Wales for the first time in a starting lineup with 13 changes for their last pool match against Uruguay on Sunday in Kumamoto.\n\nA cleanout was expected with the match just four days after Wales edged Fiji 29-17 in Oita to advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nOnly inside center Hadleigh Parkes and Josh Adams, swapped from the left to the right wing, start again. Adams scored three tries against Fiji.\n\nUnbeaten Wales likely need to beat Uruguay to win Pool D ahead of Australia.\n\nWith Dan Biggar unavailable after a head knock, Wales picked scrumhalves Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies as cover for the entire backline.\n\nWales: Leigh Halfpenny, Josh Adams, Owen Watkin, Hadleigh Parkes, Hallam Amos, Rhys Patchell, Aled Davies; Aaron Wainwright, Justin Tipuric (captain), Aaron Shingler, Adam Beard, Bradley Davies, Dillon Lewis, Ryan Elias, Nicky Smith. Reserves: Elliot Dee, Rhys Carre, Wyn Jones, Jake Ball, Ross Moriarty, James Davies, Tomos Williams, Gareth Davies.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nAustralia and Georgia meet for the first time in their last pool match in the Rugby World Cup on Friday in Shizuoka.\n\nIt\u2019s expected to rain during the evening match about 180 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, with the approach of Typhoon Hagibis up the eastern coast of Japan.\n\nThe Wallabies have already qualified for the quarterfinals after beating Fiji and Uruguay but still have a chance to top Pool D. They need to beat the Lelos, with a handy four-try bonus point, to put some pressure on unbeaten Wales to beat Uruguay on Sunday.\n\nAustralia has never lost two pool matches.\n\nGeorgia, which has beaten only Uruguay, is trying to win two pool matches for only the second time, and claim third place from Fiji and an automatic qualifying spot for the 2023 tournament in France. The Lelos have never beaten a Tier One team.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 22 at the Rugby World Cup (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/japan_rugby_wcup_argentina_usa_44758_c0-98-3918-2383_s1200x700.jpg?9eff5e698f06bf9d5840712c1ac2f724289616f2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
