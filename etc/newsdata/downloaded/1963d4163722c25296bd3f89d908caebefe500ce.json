A new committee would also be created to solely focus on any safety concerns.\n\nBoeing's Max jets were grounded by the FAA in March after 346 people died in two crashes that involved the aircraft.\n\nBoeing has said it expects to have the Max jets back in operation before the holidays in December, but three airlines that use that aircraft (United, Southwest, and American Airlines) all have recently engaged in further flight cancellations because of the ongoing grounding of the aircraft. Regulators are currently determining when and under what conditions to bring the jets back.\n\nIn July, Boeing disclosed a \"$5.6 billion reduction in revenue and pre-tax earnings\" due to the grounding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Boeing spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Boeing committee to recommend safety changes to board of directors.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/boeing-video-thumbnail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
