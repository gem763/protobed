These bitcoins were used to pay for child pornography videos on the site, which were downloaded over one million times.\n\nWelcome to Video was allegedly ran by Jong Woo Son, a 23-year-old South Korean national. Son is currently serving his sentence in South Korea. In addition to Son, 337 site users from countries like U.S., U.K. South Korea, and Canada have been arrested and charged by local government enforcement agencies.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), law enforcement agencies were able to track Welcome to Video's users by analyzing Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\n\u201cThrough the sophisticated tracing of bitcoin transactions, IRS-CI special agents were able to determine the location of the Darknet server, identify the administrator of the website and ultimately track down the website server\u2019s physical location in South Korea,\u201d said IRS-CI Chief Don Fort. \u201cThis large-scale criminal enterprise that endangered the safety of children around the world is no more. Regardless of the illicit scheme, and whether the proceeds are virtual or tangible, we will continue to work with our federal and international partners to track down these disgusting organizations and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have also filed a civil forfeiture claim to recover funds from 24 bitcoin accounts associated with three cryptocurrency exchanges. According to the DOJ, these funds, through a restoration process, will be returned to victims of the crime.\n\nRecent analysis from The Block found that bitcoin is still by far the most supported cryptocurrencies by darknet marketplaces, followed by monero and litecoin.", "description": "U.S. and Korean authorities have taken down one of the world's largest online marketplace for child pornography, according to an unsealed indictment first cited by NBC News.The post Feds take down one of the largest child exploitation sites; seeks to seize bitcoins appeared first on The Block.", "authors": ["Steven Zheng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bKTZ2lElIYUoLJP4FZDmUw--~B/aD00NTA7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_block_83/79127427844414270d1a33c3093c2848", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
