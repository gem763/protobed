Meanwhile, the listing of Australian lender Latitude Financial \u2014 what was to be the biggest Australian IPO of the year \u008d\u2014 has been canceled, according to a Reuters report. U.S. private equity firm KKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners decided to cancel the expected A$1 billion ($676.20 million) offering, because a large proportion of demand for shares was coming from hedge funds rather than desired long-term investors, the report said, citing sources. A company spokesman declined to comment to Reuters, but said Latitude expects to make an announcement on Wednesday.
