Whether it was a nasty break up that led me to hysterically call you at 3:00am because you are the only one who can stop those tears and put some sense into my head, or the time when we went for a long-drive, windows rolled down, listening to and singing our favourite songs.\n\nBetween the good times and the bad times, every single moment is better with you around.\n\nThis is to celebrate those friends who have seen us at our ugliest time and still chose to stuck around. It is friends like you who give us hope, friends who've taught us how truly rewarding friendships can be.\n\nPexels\n\nThey are the friend who has seen our messy house and literally don't care. They don't judge us for having a small car, they will sit in the passenger seat, put on some music and be proud of that car as if it's theirs. They don't pay attention to the fact that we haven't had a bath all day or are sitting in the same pajamas that we wore for two whole days ago. They will still hug the hell out of you.\n\nThey are the friend that will happily wipe away food stains from your face or even your shirt. They are the friend who have given you so much freedom to be yourself that you don't hesitate to share even the most weirdest thoughts on your mind. They are the friends who are up for any adventure, and genuinely want to explore the world with you.\n\nAnd the best part about these friends is in their strength to love us unconditionally. You know why they say money can't buy happiness? Because money can't buy you genuine friends like these, friends who become family.\n\nPexels\n\nDon't Miss 7.6 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 374 SHARES 573 SHARES 206 SHARES\n\nThe most amazing thing about friends who have seen us at our worst is that they really don't care about outer appearances, the things you own or how much money you can shell out. These are friends who when they see us angry they want to talk us out of it.\n\nThey hear us yell, scream, break things, only to give us a pep talk when we are done venting. These friends choose to sit down over a cup of coffee, hear us out, talk to us. And I bet you know how rare that is.\n\nThis is for friends who help us excel. Who help us dream. Who pick us up from our worst state and make us into a whole new person. These are the kind of friendships worth having. Where there is only love, even at the worst phases of our life.", "description": "You know why they say money can't buy happiness?
