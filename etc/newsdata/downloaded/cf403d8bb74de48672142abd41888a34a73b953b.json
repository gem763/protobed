Could I use this as my emergency fund?\n\nJeff\n\nDear Jeff,\n\nIf you want to call that $12,000 an emergency fund, that\u2019s okay. But if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d strongly advise cashing out the stock and putting the money in a good, easily accessible money market account\u2014one with check-writing privileges. Stocks are long-term investments. The only purpose of an emergency fund is to have cash on hand immediately in the event of an emergency.\n\nSpecifically, an emergency fund is there to cover the unexpected expenses life throws at you from time to time. It\u2019s not an investment, and it\u2019s not designed to replace income. That\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s essential to keep your emergency fund liquid and easy to reach!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,I have about $12,000 in company stock.
