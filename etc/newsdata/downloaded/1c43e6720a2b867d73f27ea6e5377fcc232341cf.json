And now, if you attend Radboud University in The Netherlands, you can literally just hang out in a grave.\n\nThe concept has gone viral on Twitter after student Adam (@SPYKIDS2) shared the purification grave and his experience at the campus in a series of tweets.\n\nyou might think UK unis offering therapy dogs instead of counseling is bad, but at my uni they have this thing where they will let you lie in a grave for a while and think about life. its called the purification grave and you're not allowed to take phones or books in it with you pic.twitter.com/rsYt3CxVtZ \u2014 adam (@SPYKlDS2) October 13, 2019\n\nSince being posted at 6:24am on October 14, the post has already amassed a whopping 3.4k retweets and 12.9k likes, along with a tonne of replies.\n\nThe grave is run by the student chaplaincy (aka student church) at the university, which gives you a pillow and a mat to rest on during your visit. When using the \u2018facility\u2019, phones and books are strictly prohibited. To fully immerse yourself in the grave, you\u2019ve just gotta lay there with your thoughts.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure why the church group are such a big fan of chucking people in graves, but who am I to judge? Maybe you just need to lay in the dirt and think about life.\n\nIn addition to the grave itself, the student church also directed a slightly terrifying video of them digging the grave. You know, to set the mood.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to pretend you\u2019re dead, you can book the facility for a maximum of three hours, or a minimum of thirty minutes. I\u2019m not quite sure what happens if you try to leave before the thirty minutes is up but Adam was apparently \u201ctrying to imagine being shoved back into a grave by the student pastor as therapy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adam, he was approached on campus in his first week and told \u201cyes we offer lots of services there is a coffee morning every Wednesday and also we have a grave which you may come and lie in and pretend you are dead if you wish.\u201d\n\nHonestly, free coffee on Wednesday mornings and pretending you\u2019re dead? This university sounds like a dream.\n\nIf you miss out on the free coffee on Wednesdays, you can always swing by the 0n-campus Death Cafe. Yes. Radboud University has both a grave and a death cafe.\n\nAfter reading Adam\u2019s tweets and doing a little research of my own, this university sounds incredible. They\u2019ve got massage chairs in the library, free coffee, arts and crafts and a purification grave. What more could you possibly need?\n\nIs this an attempt to stop students saying they want to die? Is there any psychological benefit to lying in a big hole in the ground? I simply must know. Stay tuned for my thesis on the benefits of lying in a grave at uni.", "description": "Radboud University in The Netherlands offers many student services including their own 'purification grave' for all of your dying needs.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/grave.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
