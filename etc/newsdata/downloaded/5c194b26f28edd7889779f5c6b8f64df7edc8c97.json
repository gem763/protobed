But perhaps the heaviest blow came from friendly fire, when Trump\u2019s own chief of staff went on television and brazenly admitted to pushing for an aid-for-investigation swap with Ukraine, acknowledging the quid-pro-quo Trump\u2019s White House had just spent weeks denying, with the words: \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPast and current Trump administration officials are singing like canaries,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters on Friday evening. \u201cDonald Trump has spun a web of corruption so wide that it has now implicated the White House, Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of Energy, and the Office of Management and Budget.\u201d\n\nWaters may be a fierce critic of Trump begin with, but there was little denying the widening sprawl of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal this week. And each day the impeachment inquiry rolled on, new explosive details came to light.\n\nThe \u201cHand Grenade\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s rough week started with closed-door testimony from his former top Russia advisor Fiona Hill, who said Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy to politically benefit Trump outside the normal channels of government.\n\nShe also passed on some choice criticisms of Rudy from Trump\u2019s former National Security Advisor John Bolton.\n\nBolton reportedly called Giuliani \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d and slammed the pressure tactics on Ukraine as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d he wanted no part of.\n\nMeanwhile, Giuliani\u2019s own legal troubles mounted, amid signs that a federal investigation into his Ukraine-related activities has been underway since the beginning of this year. The probe reportedly includes a \u201ccounterintelligence\u201d aspect, CNN reported Wednesday.\n\nREAD: Maybe Rudy Giuliani Should Hire a Lawyer\n\nYet another Giuliani associate, David Correia, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly helping to orchestrate illegal campaign donations to GOP causes in order to buy political influence \u2014 the third of Rudy\u2019s associates to get booked by the feds in two weeks. The two others, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested the week before, trying to flee the country.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump\u2019s own EU Ambassador, Gordon Sondland, joined the pile-on, testifying that Trump ordered top officials to work with Giuliani, in a reversal of Sondland\u2019s earlier refusal to cooperate.\n\nSondland told Congress that Trump made top officials uncomfortable by putting Giuliani \u2014 a private citizen \u2014 in the center of his Ukraine policy.\n\nREAD: Ambassador Sondland Just Threw Rudy Giuliani Under the Ukraine Bus\n\nGiuliani told Sondland that Trump wanted investigations relating to both 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and Ukraine\u2019s supposed role in the 2016 election, Sondland testified.\n\n\u201cThe only obvious reason Mr. Trump would send a private lawyer to meet foreign officials is because that private lawyer would do things public officials wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a former federal prosecutor and author of a history of impeachment.\n\nBut Sondland\u2019s damning testimony was quickly one-upped by Trump\u2019s own chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who held a rare press conference on a totally unrelated subject, only to end up confirming the direct link between the aid money and pressure campaign that the White House denied for weeks.\n\nHe later tried to walk it back, but the damage was done.\n\nDemocrats hit the roof.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go around the world extorting people for a partisan political endeavor,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly. \u201cThat\u2019s somebody who does not understand our form of government, or what it means to be a democracy.\u201d\n\nRead: The White House Just Admitted That There Was a Quid Pro Quo With Ukraine. What the Hell Happens Now?\n\nThat same afternoon, Trump\u2019s Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who is also embroiled in the Ukraine controversy, told Trump he was quitting, raising questions about what fresh revelations might soon emerge about Perry\u2019s role in the Ukraine affair.\n\nPerry was one of the so-called \u201cthree amigos\u201d tasked with running Ukraine policy \u2014 along with Sondland and special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker \u2014 who were \u201cdisappointed\u201d at Giuliani\u2019s involvement, according to Sondland.\n\nGOP Blues\n\nAs this frantic week drew to a close, Republicans seemed to be on the back foot. Some even ducked VICE News reporters asking for comment in the halls of Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Friday, John Kasich, former GOP governor of Ohio, came out swinging in favor of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThis behavior, in my opinion, cannot be tolerated, and action is going to have to be taken,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats running the impeachment inquiry appeared buoyed by the momentum. Despite earlier talk about voting out articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, many appeared, increasingly, in no rush to wrap up the show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not constrained by an artificial deadline,\u201d said Rep. Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.\n\nRising poll numbers favoring their inquiry show the Americans haven\u2019t yet begun to show signs of impeachment fatigue, despite the flurry of news and activity, he said.\n\n\u201cNot only is there not fatigue \u2014 there is more interest,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump speaks during an event where he congratulated astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch as they conduct the first all-female spacewalk, from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019, in Washington.
