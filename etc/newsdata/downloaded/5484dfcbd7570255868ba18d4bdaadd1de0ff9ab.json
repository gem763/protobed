The local prosecutors noted that Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Congress last week defying its demands for information in an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Appellant has refused to participate in the very impeachment process that he presents here as the bulwark against placing a president above the law\u2026 His core position on every one of these matters is that the United States Presidency places him beyond the reach of the law,\u201d Vance\u2019s office wrote.\n\nProsecutors also emphasized their argument that allowing Trump to fend off the subpoena would threaten investigations of other individuals who could potentially be charged, regardless of whatever legal protections a president may claim.\n\nVance\u2019s office says it is investigating various matters relating to the Trump Organization, including how the business recorded so-called \u201chush money\u201d payments to two women who claimed sexual encounters with Trump, Stephanie Clifford and Karen McDougal.\n\nCohen, Trump\u2019s former attorney, has pleaded guilty in federal court to arranging those payments as part of an effort to elect Trump to the presidency in 2016. Court documents filed by federal prosecutors in Manhattan alluded to Trump as a co-conspirator in that case, but he has not been charged. Justice Department policy bars charging a sitting president with a crime.\n\nA three-judge panel of 2nd Circuit judges is scheduled to hear arguments on Trump\u2019s appeal next week.\n\nThe dispute involving the Manhattan D.A. is one of at least four ongoing court cases involving efforts to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records.\n\nLast week, Trump lost the first of those cases to reach a federal appeals court as a D.C. Circuit panel ruled, 2-1, against his attempt to block a subpoena from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have indicated they plan to go to the Supreme Court if lower courts don\u2019t back his demands to quash the subpoenas.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/27/33/490af737478eac8a13eb3537fb39/191015-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
