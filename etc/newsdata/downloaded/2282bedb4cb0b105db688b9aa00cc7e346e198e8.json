So, it is instructive to look at the development process since the founding of the People's Republic of China, to learn from the past and to evaluate possible challenges in the future.\n\nOn Sept 22, 2019, the deputy director Like Aobo of the Academic Center for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking, at Tsinghua University (ACCEPT) hosted the \"International Symposium on 70 Years of Chinese Economic Development: 1949 - 2019\" and David D. Li, the founding director of ACCEPT and chief economist of New Development Bank, released a related report.\n\nDavid D.Li, the founding director of ACCEPT and chief economist of New Development Bank, is releasing the report.[Photo/ACCEPT]\n\nSpeaking at the event, Li said that the past 70 years of economic development had led to remarkable achievements.\n\n\"So, summarizing the Chinese experience, stories and theories is not only a necessity for further development, but also helps the international community to understand China.\"\n\nHe believed that in the 30 years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the country gradually built up an independent and complete industrial system and a national economic system, laying the foundation for the latter development period.\n\nThe two valuable lessons gained at this stage, Li said, were first, that public health, basic education and infrastructure were needed for rapid development. And that independent innovation was feasible, if one country was doing well in opening-up and introducing talents.\n\nThen, in the next 40 years, which was the period of reform and opening-up, China created the largest and most extraordinary economic growth in human history, with a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics beginning to take shape.\n\nLi also pointed out that factors, including the encouragement to the local governments of creating a good business environment, the rapid solution to the industrial or commercial land use problem and the long-term economic stability, played important roles in this process.\n\nThomas Sargent, the 2011 Nobel laureate for economics and professor of economics at New York University, stressed the importance and reciprocity of free trade. He particularly emphasized that the current United States government's trade policy of increasing tariffs was damaging its own interests.\n\nThomas Sargent, the 2011 Nobel laureate for economics and professor of economics at New York University, is giving his speech.

He also added that the development of China's economics theory was a very consequent and significant step.\n\nDiscussing the economic slowdown in recent years, Vladimir Popov, the principal researcher of the Russian Academy of Sciences and research director of the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute, suggested that if China shifted from export orientation to domestic demand, there would still be space for economic growth.\n\nLiu Yuanchun, the vice-president of Renmin University of China, said that according to the analysis of the research team from Renmin University of China, in terms of macro economy, China's high growth and low macro economic volatility are mainly due to China's investment stability, especially the counter-cyclical investment of state-owned enterprises, rather than short-term adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nScholars are getting together at the International Symposium on 70 Years of Chinese Economic Development: 1949 - 2019.
