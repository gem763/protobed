REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nOil was bid higher as deadly anti-government unrest gripped Iraq, the second-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nThe unrest in Iraq has begun to bring the so-called risk premium that supports prices back into focus, after supply concerns had eased in the wake of Saudi Arabia\u2019s faster-than-expected recovery from attacks key oil facilities last month, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nervousness about the situation in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, right now,\u201d Kilduff said. \u201cOil prices have no choice but to go up.\u201d\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.11% to $52.87 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $58.51, up 0.24% on the day.\n\nRemarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and minutes from the most recent Fed meeting will later this week keep traders searching for signs on what the central bank is considering in its upcoming meeting.\n\nOn Wall Street, major stock indexes edged higher clinging to comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow regarding the state of the trade war with China.\n\nStocks were hit last week on concerns that softening U.S. manufacturing and services sector data were a harbinger for a slide to recession in the world\u2019s largest economy. Strong jobs data on Friday softened the blow.\n\n\u201cInvestors are somewhat tired of the same song and dance from the administration. They are not going to fully buy in until something materializes from the meeting,\u201d said Matt Ruffalo, senior strategist at Clarfeld Financial Advisors in New Jersey.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 75.04 points, or 0.28%, to 26,648.76, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.54 points, or 0.22%, to 2,958.55 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.13 points, or 0.31%, to 8,007.61.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.71% and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.21%.\n\nEmerging market stocks lost 0.15%.\n\nGraphic: Global assets in 2019 - tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl\n\nGraphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nGraphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - tmsnrt.rs/2ihRugV\n\nGraphic: MSCI All Country World Index Market Cap - tmsnrt.rs/2EmTD6j\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of its peers, but Turkey\u2019s lira slid to its lowest level against the dollar in more than a month after the White House said Ankara would soon launch unilateral military operations in northeast Syria.\n\nThe Turkish lira TRY= lost 2.39% versus the U.S. dollar at 5.84, its weakest in over a month. A move above 5.8577 would send the currency to its weakest since June.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump later threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if Ankara does anything \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.15%, with the euro EUR= down 0.02% to $1.0974.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.42% versus the greenback at 107.41 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2303, down 0.23% on the day.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields drifted higher, with benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last down 12/32 in price to yield 1.5528%, from 1.514% late on Friday.\n\nSpot gold XAU= dropped 0.9% to $1,491.56 an ounce.
