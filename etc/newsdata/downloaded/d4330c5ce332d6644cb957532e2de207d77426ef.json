She says: 'It took 645 hours-worth of icing alone, but I think it's been worth it. People have been leaning over the buildings and gasping when they see all the interior detail through the windows.\n\n'The cakes are all edible because the whisky is a preservative \u2014 the longer you leave it, the better they'll taste!'\n\nAs well as a total of nine litres of whisky, the cakes swallowed up 608 eggs, 66lb of butter, 73lb of flour, 12 jars of apricot jam and 462lb of icing.\n\nThe retired florist lives in Youlgreave, near Bakewell, with husband Paul, 65, who is also retired.

In a nod to this dark history, 30 wooden rats have been hidden among the cakes' buildings as a competition for visitors to find.\n\nSandra Naylor, 61, a retired civil servant who now fundraises for the community bus service, said planning for the giant cake bake started in January.\n\nThe Eyam Town Hall was made into a fruit cake for the astonishing display\n\nLynn Nolan bakes her magnificent fruit cakes modelled on the village of Eyam\n\nFruit cake in the process of being made by Mrs Nolan\n\nMrs Nolan in the process of baking the cakes.
