Pixel devices have managed to crack the top five in the U.S. and Western Europe, but otherwise represent less than 1% of the overall market. It\u2019s true, of course, that the company got a late start, largely watching on the sidelines as companies like Samsung and Huawei shipped millions of Android devices.\n\nEarlier this year, Google admitted that it was feeling the squeeze of slowing smartphone sales along with the rest of the industry. During Alphabet\u2019s Q1 earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai noted that poor hardware numbers were a reflection of \u201cpressure in the premium smartphone industry.\u201d\n\nIntroduced at I/O, the Pixel 3a was an attempt to augment disappointing sales numbers with the introduction of a budget-tier device. With a starting price of $399, the device seemingly went over as intended. The 3a, coupled with more carrier partners, helped effectively double year over year growth for the line. Given all of this, it seems like a pretty safe bet that the six-month Pixel/Pixela cycle will continue, going forward.\n\nOf course, the addition of a mid-range device adds more onus for the company to differentiate the flagship. With a starting price of $799, the Pixel 4 certainly isn\u2019t expensive by modern flagship standards. But Google certainly needs to present enough distinguishing features to justify a $400 price gulf between devices \u2014 especially as the company disclosed software upgrades introduced on flagship devices will soon make their way onto their cheaper counterparts.\n\nIndeed, the much-rumored and oft-leaked devices bring some key changes to the line. The company has finally given in and added a dual-camera setup to both premium models, along with an upgraded 90Hz display, face unlock, radar-based gestures and a whole bunch of additional software features.\n\nThe truth is that the Pixel has always occupied a strange place in the smartphone world. As the successor to Google\u2019s Nexus partnerships, the product can be regarded as a showcase for Android\u2019s most compelling features. But gone are the days of leading the pack with the latest version of the operating system. The fact that OnePlus devices already have Android 10 means Google\u2019s going head to head against another reasonably price manufacturer of quality handsets.\n\nThe Pixel line steps up a bit on the design side to distinguish the product from the \u201ca\u201d line. Google\u2019s phones have never been as flashy as Samsung\u2019s or Apple\u2019s, and that\u2019s still the case here, but a new dual-sided glass design (Gorilla Glass 5 on both), coupled with a metal band, does step up the premium feel a bit. The product is also a bit heavier and thicker than the 3, lending some heft to the device.\n\nThere are three colors now: black, white and a poppy \u201cOh So Orange,\u201d which is available in limited quantities here in the U.S. The color power button continues to be a nice touch, lending a little character to the staid black and white devices. While the screen gets a nice update to 90Hz OLED, Google still has no interest in the world of notches or hole punches. Rather, it\u2019s keeping pretty sizable bezels on the top and bottom.\n\nThe Pixel 4 gets a bit of a screen size boost from 5.5 to 5.7 inches, with an increase of a single pixel per inch, while the Pixel 4 XL stays put at 6.4 inches (with a PPI increase of 522 to 537). The dual front-facing camera has been ditched this time out, instead opting for the single eight megapixel, similar to what you\u2019ll find on the 3a.\n\nStorage hasn\u2019t changed, with both 64 and 128GB options for both models; RAM has been bumped up to a default 6GB from 4GB last time out. The processor, too, is the latest and greatest from Qualcomm, bumping from a Snapdragon 845 to an 855. Interestingly, however, the batteries have actually been downgraded.\n\nThe 4 and 4 XL sport a 2,800 and 3,700mAh, respectively. That should be augmented a bit by new battery-saving features introduced in Android 10, but even still, that\u2019s not the direction you want to see these things going.\n\nThe camera is, in a word, great. Truth be told, I\u2019ve been using it to shoot photos for the site since I got the phone last week. This Google Nest Mini review, Amazon Echo review and Virgin Galactic space suit news were all shot on the Pixel 4. The phone isn\u2019t yet a \u201cleave your DSLR at home\u201d proposition, of course, but damn if it can\u2019t take a fantastic photo in less than ideal and mixed light with minimal futzing around.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that this represents a small but important shift in philosophy for Google. After multiple generations of suggesting that software solutions could do more than enough heavy lifting on image processing, the company\u2019s finally bit the bullet and embraced a second camera. Sometimes forward progress means abandoning past stances. Remember when the company dug its heels in on keeping the headphone jack, only to drop it the following year?\n\nThe addition of a second camera isn\u2019t subtle, either. In fact, it\u2019s hard to miss. Google\u2019s adopted a familiar square configuration on the rear of the device. That\u2019s just how phones look now, I suppose. Honestly, it\u2019s fine once you conquer a bit of trypophobia, with a pair of lenses aligned horizontally and a sensor up top and flash on bottom \u2014 as one of last week\u2019s presenters half joked, \u201cwe hope you\u2019ll use it as a flash light.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is a reference to the Pixel\u2019s stellar low-light capabilities. It\u2019s been a welcome feature, in an age where most smartphone users continue to overuse their flashes, completely throwing off the photo in the process. Perhaps the continued improvements will finally break that impulse in people \u2014 though I\u2019m not really getting my hopes up on that front. Old habits, etc.\n\nThe 4 and 4 XL have the same camera set up, adopting the 12.2-megapixel (wide angle) lens from their predecessors and adding a 16-megapixel (telephoto) into the mix. I noted some excitement about the setup in my write-up. That\u2019s not because the two-camera setup presents anything remarkable \u2014 certainly not in this area of three, four and five-camera flagships. It\u2019s more about the groundwork that Google has laid out in the generations leading up to this device.\n\nEssentially it comes down to this: Look at what the company has been able to accomplish using software and machine learning with a single camera setup. Now add a second telephoto camera into the mix. See, Super High Res Zoom is pretty impressive, all told. But if you really want a tighter shot without degrading the image in the process, optical zoom is still very much the way to go.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong case to be made that the Pixel 4\u2019s camera is the best in class. The pictures speak for themselves. The aforementioned TechCrunch shots were done with little or no manual adjustments or post-processing. Google offers on-screen adjustments, like the new dual-exposure control, which lets you manually adjust brightness and shadow brightness on the fly. Honestly, though, I find the best way to test these cameras is to use them the way most buyers will: by pointing and shooting.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1900084,1900086,1900087,1900088,1900090,1900091,1900092\"]\n\nThe fact is that a majority of people who buy these handsets won\u2019t be doing much fiddling with the settings. As such, it\u2019s very much on handset makers to ensure that users get the best photograph by default, regardless of conditions. Once again, software is doing much of the heavy lifting. Super Res Zoom works well in tandem with the new lens, while Live HDR+ does a better job approximating how the image will ultimately look once fully processed. Portrait mode shots look great, and the device is capable of capturing them at variable depths, meaning you don\u2019t have to stand a specific distance from the subject to take advantage of the well-done artificial bokeh.\n\nOur video producer, Veanne, who is admittedly a far better photographer than I can ever hope to be, tested out the camera for the weekend.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1900045,1900046,1900047,1900048,1900049,1900050,1900051,1900052\"]\n\nAlthough Veanne was mostly impressed by the Pixel 4\u2019s camera and photo editing capabilities, here are three major gripes.\n\n\u201cDigital zoom is garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn low lighting situations, you lose ambiance. Saturday evening\u2019s intimate, warmly lit dinner looked like a cafeteria meal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBright images in low lighting gives you the impression that the moving objects would be in focus as well. That is not the case.\u201d\n\nOther additions round out the experience, including \u201cFrequent Faces,\u201d which learns the faces of subjects you frequently photograph. Once again, the company is quick to point out that the feature is both off by default and all of the processing happens on the device. Turning it off also deletes all of the saved information. Social features have been improved, as well, with quick access to third-party platforms like Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nGoogle keeps pushing out improvements to Lens, as well. This time out, language translation, document scanning and text copy and pasting can be performed with a quick tap. Currently the language translation is still a bit limited, with only support for English, Spanish, German, Hindi and Japanese. More will be \u201crolling out soon,\u201d per the company.\n\nGestures is a strange one. I\u2019m far from the first to note that Google is far from the first to attempt the feature. The LG G8 ThinQ is probably the most recent prominent example of a company attempting to use gestures as a way to differentiate themselves. To date, I\u2019ve not seen a good implementation of the technology \u2014 certainly not one I could ever see myself actually using day to day.\n\nThe truth is, no matter how interesting or innovative a feature is, people aren\u2019t going to adopt it if it doesn\u2019t work as advertised. LG\u2019s implementation was a pretty big disappointment.\n\nSimply put, the Pixel\u2019s gestures are not that. They\u2019re better in that, well, they work, pretty much as advertised. This is because the underlying technology is different. Rather than relying on cameras like other systems, the handset uses Project Soli, a long-promised system that utilizes a miniature radar chip to detect far more precise movement.\n\nSoli does, indeed work, but the precision is going to vary a good deal from user to user. The thing is, simply detecting movement isn\u2019t enough. Soli also needs to distinguish intention. That means the system is designed to weed out accidental gestures of the manner we\u2019re likely making all the time around our phones. That means the system appears to be calibrated to bigger, intentional movements.\n\nThat can be a little annoying for things like advancing tracks. I don\u2019t think there are all that many instances where waving one\u2019s hands across a device Obi-Wan Kenobi-style is really saving all that much time or effort versus touching a screen. If, however, Google was able to customize the experience to the individual over time using machine learning, it could be a legitimately handy feature.\n\nThat brings us to the next important point: functionality. So you\u2019ve got this neat new piece of tiny radar that you\u2019re sticking inside your phone. You say it\u2019s low energy and more private than a camera. Awesome! So, how do you suggest I, you know, use it?\n\nThere are three key ways, at the moment:\n\nMusic playback\n\nAlarm Silencing\n\nWaving at Pok \u00e9 mon\n\nThe first two are reasonably useful. The primary use case I can think of are when, say, your phone is sitting in front of you at your desk. Like mine is, with me, right now. Swiping my hand left to right a few inches above the device advances the track. Right to left goes a track back. The movements need to be deliberate, from one end of the device to the other.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the phenomenon of \u201cPok\u00e9mon Wave Hello.\u201d It\u2019s not really correct to call the title a game, exactly. It\u2019s little more than a way of showcasing Motion Sense \u2014 albeit an extremely delightful way.\n\nYou might have caught a glimpse of it at the keynote the other day. It came and went pretty quickly. Suddenly Pikachu was waving at the audience, appearing out of nowhere like so many wild Snorlaxes. Just as quickly, he was gone.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1900104,1900106,1900107,1900108,1900109,1900110,1900111,1900112,1900113,1900114,1900115,1900116,1900117\"]\n\nMore than anything, it\u2019s a showcase title for the technology. A series of five Pok\u00e9mon, beginning with Pikachu, appear demanding you interact with them through a series of waves. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s silly and you\u2019ll finish the whole thing in about three minutes. That\u2019s not really the point, though. Pok\u00e9mon Wave Hello exists to:\n\nGet you used to gestures. Demonstrate functionality beyond simple features. Gaming, AR \u2014 down the road, these things could ultimately find fun and innovative ways to integrate Soli.\n\nFor now, however, use is extremely limited. There are some fun little bits, including dynamic wallpaper that reacts to movement. The screen also glows subtly when detecting you \u2014 a nice little touch (there\u2019s a similar effect for Assistant, as well).\n\nPerhaps most practical, however, is the fact that the phone can detect when you\u2019re reaching for it and begin the unlocking process. That makes the already fast new Face Unlock feature ever faster. Google ditched the fingerprint reader this time around, opting for neither a physical sensor nor in-screen reader. Probably for the best on the latter front, given the pretty glaring security woes Samsung experienced last week when a British woman accidentally spoofed the reader with a $3 screen protector. Yeeesh.\n\nThere are some nice security precautions on here. Chief among them is the fact that the unlock is done entirely on-device. All of the info is saved and processed on the phone\u2019s Titan M chip, meaning it doesn\u2019t get sent up to the cloud. That both makes it a speedier process and means Google won\u2019t be sharing your face data with its other services \u2014 a fact Google felt necessary to point out, for obvious reasons.\n\nFor a select few of us, at least, Recorder feels like a legitimate game changer. And its ease of use and efficacy should be leaving startups like Otter.ai quaking at its potential, especially if/when Google opts to bring it to other Android handsets and iOS.\n\nI was initially unimpressed by the app upon trying it out at last week\u2019s launch event. It struggles to isolate audio in noisy environments \u2014 likely as much of a hardware as software constraint. One on one and it\u2019s far better, though attempting to, say, record audio from a computer can still use some work.\n\nOpen the app and hit record and you\u2019ll see a waveform pop up. The line is blue when detecting speech and gray when hearing other sounds. Tap the Transcript button and you\u2019ll see the speech populate the page in real time. From there you can save it with a title and tag the location.\n\nThe app will automatically tag keywords and make everything else searchable for easy access. In its first version, it already completely blows Apple\u2019s Voice Memos out of the water. There\u2019s no comparison, really. It\u2019s in a different league. Ditto for other apps I\u2019ve used over the years, like Voice Record.\n\nSpeaking to the product, the recording was still a little hit or miss. It\u2019s not perfect \u2014 no AI I\u2019ve encountered is. But it\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019d certainly recommend going back over the text before doing anything with it. Like Otter and other voice apps, you can play back the audio as it highlights words, karaoke-style.\n\nThe text can be saved to Google Drive, but can\u2019t be edited in app yet. Audio can be exported, but not as a combined file. The punctuation leaves something to be desired and Recorder is not yet able to distinguish individual voices. These are all things a number of standalone services offer, along with a web-based platform. That means that none of them are out of business yet, but if I was running any of them, I\u2019d be pretty nervous right about now.\n\nAs someone who does interviews for a living, however, I\u2019m pretty excited by the potential here. I can definitely see Recorder become one of my most used work apps, especially after some of the aforementioned kinks get ironed out in the next version. As for those who don\u2019t do this for a living, usefulness is probably a bit limited, though there are plenty of other potential uses, like school lecturers.\n\nThe Pixel continues to distinguish itself through software updates and camera features. There are nice additions throughout that set it apart from the six-month-old 3a, as well, including a more premium design and new 90Hz display. At $799, the price is definitely a vast improvement over competitors like Samsung and Apple, while retaining flagship specs.\n\nThe Pixel 4 doesn\u2019t exactly address what Google wants the Pixel to be, going forward. The Pixel 3a was confirmation that users were looking for a far cheaper barrier of entry. The Pixel 4, on the other hand, is priced above OnePlus\u2019s excellent devices. Nor is the product truly premium from a design perspective.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the future will look like as Google works to address the shifting smartphone landscape. In the meantime, however, the future looks bright for camera imaging, and Google remains a driving force on that front.", "description": "Google\u2019s first-party hardware has always been a drop in the bucket of global smartphone sales.
