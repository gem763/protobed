Students for Fair Admissions, Blum\u2019s group, is almost certain to appeal and the case is widely expected to wind up before the Supreme Court, which has upheld affirmative action in college admissions multiple times \u2014 but now may be less likely to green-light the practice again with a more conservative majority created by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cStudents for Fair Admissions is disappointed that the court has upheld Harvard\u2019s discriminatory admissions policies,\" Blum said in a statement. \"We believe that the documents, emails, data analysis and depositions SFFA presented at trial compellingly revealed Harvard\u2019s systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants.\n\n\u201cSFFA will appeal this decision to the First Court of Appeals and, if necessary, to the U.S Supreme Court,\" Blum added.\n\nHarvard University President Lawrence Bacow, in a statement, said that the \"consideration of race, alongside many other factors, helps us achieve our goal of creating a diverse student body that enriches the education of every student.\" He also applauded the Harvard students \"who made their voices heard in this case and during the trial.\"\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Lee, the lead trial lawyer representing Harvard in the lawsuit. \"It represents a significant victory not merely for Harvard, but also for all schools and students, for diversity, and for the rule of law. As the court has recognized, now is not the time to turn back the clock on diversity and opportunity.\u201d\n\nBurroughs\u2019 decision mounted a strong defense of race-conscious admissions and the importance of diversity in higher education. Such policies, so long as they meet the Supreme Court\u2019s standard of strict scrutiny, \u201chave an important place in society and help ensure that colleges and universities can offer a diverse atmosphere that fosters learning, improves scholarship, and encourages mutual respect and understanding,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe opinion notes that the Supreme Court\u2019s 2003 ruling in the Grutter case outlined an expectation that racial preferences in colleges would not be needed in 25 years.\n\n\u201cAs time marches on and the effects of entrenched racism and unequal opportunity remain obvious, this goal might be optimistic and may need to change,\u201d Burroughs wrote, adding that \u201cat least for now, ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race conscious admissions.\u201d\n\nIt is not yet time to \u201cclose the curtain on race conscious admissions policies,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe rich diversity at Harvard and other colleges and universities and the benefits that flow from that diversity will foster the tolerance, acceptance and understanding that will ultimately make race conscious admissions obsolete.\u201d\n\nThe case\u2019s decision comes as the Trump administration has cracked down on the use of race in admissions. The administration scrapped Obama-era guidance that called on school superintendents and colleges to consider race when trying to diversify their campuses.\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, has backed the lawsuit against Harvard and is separately investigating whether Harvard's and Yale's use of race discriminates against Asian American applicants. The Education Department\u2019s civil rights office earlier this year reached an agreement with Texas Tech medical school that ended its consideration of race. The office also has investigated complaints that a Maryland school district is discriminating against Asian American students in admissions to its sought-after magnet schools.\n\nHigher education and civil rights groups have rallied behind Harvard in the case, which is significant because it targets an admissions policy that has been praised by the Supreme Court as a model. The groups lauded the district court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s ruling today confirmed what the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld: affirmative action policies expand equal educational opportunity for all people of color, including Asian Americans, and are legal,\u201d Vanita Gupta, president of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Edward Blum and the Barr Department of Justice to accept that.\u201d\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents the nation\u2019s colleges and universities, said in a statement that the ruling \u201cis especially gratifying because it occurs against a backdrop of continuing attacks on what remains the settled law of the land in this area.\u201d\n\nMitchell added that the organization is \u201cconfident that the nation\u2019s courts, including its highest court, will continue to uphold the vital principle that colleges and universities that choose to do so can consider race as one factor in reviewing applicants to achieve the goal of a talented, diverse incoming class.\u201d\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions argued in court that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian Americans; that it engages in illegal racial balancing; that Harvard\u2019s use of race falls outside what the Supreme Court has allowed; and that Harvard doesn\u2019t need to consider race at all to shape its freshman class.\n\nSwan Lee, a co-founder and board member of the Asian American Coalition for Education, which backed Students for Fair Admissions' suit, said she was shocked by the ruling. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the judge would rule for systemic racial stereotyping conducted by Harvard,\" she said.\n\nShe said Harvard\u2019s experts used \u201cblatant racial stereotypes by saying white applicants are more well-rounded and Asian American applicants are more flat,\u201d based on the admissions department's holistic approach.\n\n\u201cIt is a disparaging decision for Asian American students because it is saying that it is OK to attach the Asian American identity to very negative stereotypes,\u201d Lee said. She was referring to what she said were consistently low likability ratings given to Asian American students through the holistic process.\n\n\u201cThis is terrible and goes way beyond college education,\u201d she added. \u201cThese stereotypes are destructive for their whole lives, whether you're going to school or working. The damage goes way beyond just education.\u201d\n\nThough Burroughs ruled in Harvard\u2019s favor, Lee said, \u201cI feel some comfort because we still have pending complaints with the DOJ against Harvard and Yale.\u201d\n\nThe case was a new tactic for Blum, who has pushed legal challenges to affirmative action in the past, including a lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin. That suit, which went to the Supreme Court, was on behalf of Abigail Fisher, a white woman who claimed the university\u2019s rejection of her application in 2008 violated the equal protection clause.\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, and in 2016 issued a 4-3 ruling in UT\u2019s favor.\n\nThe ruling built on years of precedent. In a landmark 1978 ruling, the court banned racial quotas but said race could still be considered as one of many factors in admissions. In two separate rulings in legal challenges to the use of race by the University of Michigan and its law school, the court again approved affirmative action but continued to narrow the ways it could be used.\n\nThe Harvard case is one prong of SFFA\u2019s drive to challenge race in college admissions nationally. The group is also suing the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in federal court, arguing that admissions officials closely monitor the racial makeup of an incoming class, which SFFA has said is tantamount to racial balancing.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1e/7f/4290099f48619ac1b25f28ef3ad0/20191001-harvard-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
