The demonstration saw about 1,500 employees take to the streets near Amazon\u2019s downtown Seattle headquarters.\n\n\u201cTo all the tech workers who can no longer sit at our desks and be silent as we speed toward global ecological disaster,\u201d Weston Fribley, a software developer at Amazon, said to the crowd Friday. \u201cWe are tech workers with a common purpose, acting together to push our companies to take responsibility for their impact on the world.\u201d\n\nAmazon Employees for Climate Justice outlined three demands for the company when it announced it would be taking part in the Global Climate Strike: for Amazon to have zero emissions by 2030, to stop giving campaign donations to politicians who deny climate change is happening, and to stop offering custom cloud-computing services to oil and gas companies to aid in finding and extracting more fossil fuels.\n\nThe Global Climate Strike, a coordinated movement of hundreds of demonstrations across the world, also provided an opportunity for a sly, preemptive move by CEO Jeff Bezos just one day before the employee walkout.\n\nBezos announced a series of proposals to diminish Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint, which currently sits at about 44.4 million metric tons per year, according to data released by the company Thursday. This figure ranks the company within the top 150 to 200 polluters in the world, the New York Times reports.\n\nAmazon committed to meeting the Paris Climate Accord 10 years early and becoming carbon neutral by 2040 at an event at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe want to use our scale and our scope to lead the way,\u201d Bezos said at the event. \u201cOne of the things we know about Amazon as a role model for this is that it\u2019s a difficult challenge for us because we have deep, large physical infrastructure. So, if we can do this, anyone can do this.\u201d\n\nTo meet its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040, Bezos said Amazon will run 80 percent of its \u201cglobal infrastructure\u201d on renewable energy by 2024, and 100 percent by 2030. The company also announced in a blog post that it plans to purchase 100,000 electric delivery vehicles that will be delivering packages by 2021, and to have a full fleet of trucks by 2030.\n\nHowever, Bezos\u2019 proposals fell short of most of the demands made by employees participating in the walkout. Amazon employees demand that the company has no carbon emissions by 2030, and the company committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2040.\n\nBezos said that Amazon would still continue to sell its cloud services to the oil and gas industry at the event in Washington D.C. He also added that Amazon was examining whether its political donations were going to \u201cactive climate deniers,\u201d but he stopped short of saying that the company would not give any future contributions.\n\nBobby Gordon, a finance manager at Amazon, told The Daily Beast he was pleasantly surprised by Bezos\u2019 announcement, but he wasn\u2019t completely satisfied with the outlined proposals.\n\n\u201cWe saw the steps taken and suggested by the announcement as a big win for us, but there\u2019s still a lot more to do beyond to keep the planet livable and safe, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re out here today,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIn particular, the Paris climate agreement is a political agreement, and not a scientific agreement. We need to follow more closely to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s plan for protecting the planet.\u201d\n\nAmazon announced Thursday that they are the first signatory of a new pact called the \u201cClimate Pledge.\u201d The pledge includes measuring and publicly reporting greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, which many other companies, including Google, have done for years, but Amazon has declined to do in the past.\n\nVenkatesh Srinivas, a software engineer at Google, told The Daily Beast that he was pleased with Google\u2019s announcement that it would be purchasing 1.6 gigawatts of large scale renewable power. But it\u2019s not enough, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love numbers without context,\u201d Srinivas said. He said that Google cranks at about 37 gigawatts every morning, so the new renewables only power about 1/37th of the company\u2019s output. \u201cThat only covers the Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin,\u201d he added.\n\nSam Kern, a UX designer at Google, said the tech industry has helped solve a lot of problems, but has ushered in a set of brand new ones.\n\n\u201cWe help bring together families\u2014we help separate families,\u201d Kern said. \u201cTech has been governed by the impulse to reshape and disrupt, often in the name of our users. We pass signs in the hallways telling us to put the user first. Now, putting the user first means doing everything we can to fight for their homes, for their families, for their futures.\u201d\n\nKern spoke to 1,500 employees who walked out of the office in downtown Seattle on Friday, culminating in a youth-led march to City Hall. Employees carried signs depicting the organizers\u2019 three goals, and took part in protest songs and chants.\n\nWhile most Amazon employees seemed to think the direction of their company\u2019s announcement was promising, many echoed the same sentiment: it\u2019s only a start.\n\n\u201cPlans must be implemented, and as we all know, implementation details do matter,\u201d Fribley said to laughter from the crowd. \u201cAmazon is still funding lobbyists and politicians who deny the climate reality. We still have work to do.\u201d\n\nSrinivas agreed. \u201cWe have this motto inside Google: \u2018Let\u2019s celebrate, now back to work,\u2019 Srinivas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of thing. That\u2019s fantastic, now we have to do a lot more to do.\u201d", "description": "Amazon, Google, and Microsoft workers organized to protest their companies\u2019 role in expediting climate change.
