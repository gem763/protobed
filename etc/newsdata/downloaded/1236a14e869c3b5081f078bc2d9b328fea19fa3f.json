Two other images and a video of him in blackface later emerged.\n\nNow, Scheer is the clear front-runner with as much as a 5-percentage-point lead, according to three different polls conducted after the images were published and released between late Monday and early Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRight now, the election has become a referendum on Justin Trudeau,\u201d Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said in an interview. \u201cIs he trustworthy? Is he competent?\u201d\n\nThe old blackface pictures of the prime minister have taken over the campaign narrative ahead of the Oct. 21 vote and are \u201cblotting out the sun,\u201d Bricker said.\n\nConservatives would win 36% of the vote compared with 32% for the Liberals, the Ipsos poll for Global News showed, while the Angus Reid Institute puts Scheer\u2019s party at 35% versus 30% for Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. Ekos Politics has the Conservatives at 35.3% and Liberals at 32%.\n\nOn the flip side, the Nanos Research poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail, which is conducted daily, has the Liberals taking back the lead with 35.1% against 33.5% for the Conservatives after a series of policy announcements in recent days.\n\nThe announcements kept coming on Tuesday, when the Liberals committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 if re-elected, and they also said they would beat the current 2030 emissions goal.\n\nTrudeau is expected to speak about climate change on the west coast on Tuesday, where his party is battling against the Green Party for several seats.\n\nThe prime minister will speak in Barnaby, British Columbia, at 12:30 p.m. ET, and will likely be pressed about how his climate action promises contrast with his government\u2019s purchase and planned expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which runs through the province.\n\nEkos pollster Frank Graves said the initial dramatic shift in public opinion caused by the scandal had receded, but there were increasing questions about Trudeau\u2019s leadership and the race was wide open.\n\n\u201cThe backlash may very well be a product of issues around Mr. Trudeau, rather than the blackface episode itself,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThe race now appears much tighter and less predictable than it did before.\u201d", "description": "Canada's Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has overtaken Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of next month's national election, polls showed on Tuesday, after past images of Trudeau in blackface emerged last week.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433358143&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N182", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
