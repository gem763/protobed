Defensively disciplined and deserving of their success. They\u2019ll fancy Bournemouth in their Saturday lunchtime showdown on the south coast.\n\nWith just one win from their previous eleven trips to Stamford Bridge in all competitions, you had to be either brave or a die-hard fan to back them here with Frank Lampard\u2019s side on a run of seven straight wins.\n\nLampard had warned his players were \u201ca million miles\u201d away from the side beaten 4-0 at Old Trafford in August.\n\nHere, though, the United players wanted it more. Lampard acknowledged Rashford\u2019s free-kick from around 25 yards into the top corner, with 17 minutes left, as being \u201cspecial\u201d and rightly so.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut maybe the Chelsea players had turned up expecting to win. What other explanation could there be for the Blues\u2019 failure to get a single shot on target during the first 45 minutes?\n\nUnited may have won at Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League and Norwich in the Premier League but with their fragile confidence they were there for the taking.\n\nWith the likes of Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham on the bench, however, Chelsea could not even test them.\n\nPropelled by a wall of noise from the travelling fans behind them. United were resolute at the back and stronger in midfield.\n\nWhen they needed that little bit of luck in the final third, Daniel James provided it. The Wales winger drove into the Chelsea box on 25 minutes with young defender Marc Guehi in front of him and seemingly nowhere to go.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThundering in behind him, however, came Marcos Alonso with a challenge he simply did not need to make. Down went James and out stretched the hand of referee Paul Tierney towards the penalty spot.\n\nMarcus Rashford drilled low into the bottom corner as Willy Caballero went the other way.\n\nChelsea finally turned up for work in the second half with Marcos Rojo forced to block from Billy Gilmour and Callum Hudson-Odoi volleying narrowly over the bar from the edge of their box amid an assault on the United goal.\n\nThe United hinges were creaking as Chelsea kept banging on the door.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThey smashed it open on 61 minutes when Michy Batshuayi gained possession on the half-way line, outpaced Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Marcos Rojo and powered the ball low into the bottom corner from outside the box. Brilliant goal.\n\nIt would take a special goal to upstage it and Rashford\u2019s banger did just that.\n\nIt was an effort worthy of settling any game. What a shame Solskjaer didn\u2019t fancy facing the press at the end to accept the credit he and his team deserved.", "description": "United's win over Chelsea was their third away victory in a row following a run of 11 games without tasting victory on the road", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761605.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chelsea-FC-v-Manchester-United-Carabao-Cup-Round-of-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
