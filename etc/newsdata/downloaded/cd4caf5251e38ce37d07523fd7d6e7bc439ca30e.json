Speculation that it has been considering an IPO has been rife since last year.\n\nByteDance has been put under the spotlight in recent weeks after U.S. senators raised concerns over its TikTok platform\u2019s collection of user data and whether China censors content seen by U.S. users.\n\nFacebook (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users, also attacked the app over censorship concerns.\n\nTikTok says China does not have jurisdiction over the app\u2019s content as the app does not operate in China and that it is not influenced by any foreign government, including that of China.", "description": "ByteDance, which owns short-form video app TikTok, said on Tuesday it had no immediate plans for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, denying a Financial Times report that said it was looking to list as soon as the first quarter of next year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446054901&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1NB", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
