Minutes earlier, he had been giving me a masterclass in how to trash-talk your opponent: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick something that will hurt their ego. They\u2019re confident, they\u2019re out there. So you say: \u2018Waste of time you being here. Are you just making up the numbers?\u2019\u201d But now Wolf is telling me about the little girl with cancer who used to visit the live shows and he is welling up. It turns out the Wolfman is a big old softie.\n\nBefore meeting Wolf \u2013 real name Michael van Wijk, but of course we will call him Wolf \u2013 I lie in my hotel room, watching a two-and-a-half-hour supercut of his best bits on YouTube. It is a tremendous montage of Wolf throwing his helmet at competitors and eating yellow cards and shouting at the referee John Anderson. I am watching Wolf square up to a contender when my phone vibrates. He is here.\n\nIn real life, Wolf is a softly spoken, uxorious sweetheart, who buys me a Coke and bears scant resemblance to the menacing baddie we learned to love and hate in the 90s. He recalls the Wolfman persona with detached amusement. \u201cI approached the producers and said: \u2018Can I be bad?\u2019 They said: \u2018No. Everyone is squeaky clean in this. It\u2019s for kids \u2013 you can\u2019t be bad.\u2019 I said: \u2018Please \u2013 the name lends itself to it. Big bad wolf. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 They said: \u2018OK, for one show.\u2019 I did it and the crowd just exploded.\u201d The Wolf character evolved over time. \u201cI realised you can\u2019t be bad every show. Sometimes you have to be nice.\u201d He puts on the Wolf voice for me. \u201cHe\u2019s big, he\u2019s bad,\u201d Wolf growls. I am in raptures.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 1998 lineup of Gladiators ... back row: Warrior, Raider, Hunter, Saracen and Trojan; middle: Falcon, Rhino, Cobra, Nightshade, Wolf and Panther; front: Amazon, Vogue, Lightning, Jet and Zodiac. Photograph: ITV/Rex\n\nThe main thing Wolf would like you to know is that, almost 20 years after Gladiators left terrestrial TV, he is still in thunderously good shape and could take on any challenge the producers threw at him, were they to bring back the show. We discuss his keto diet and training regimen. \u201cLots of men let their legs go,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cNot me.\u201d (I suspect this is why he is wearing athletic shorts in October.) It is clear he misses the glory days of performing before a 10,000-capacity crowd, all madly rooting for him and baying for his blood at the same time. Sky brought him back as a team captain for its 2008 reboot, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cIt was like going to someone\u2019s wedding when it should be you getting married. I wanted to take part. I was fit and ready.\u201d\n\nTo this day, Gladiators enjoys a hypnotic pull on the British consciousness. I know this first-hand. A child of the 90s, I am so cravenly excited to meet Wolf that my most-used emoji in the week leading up to our interview is a tiny wolf. His voice \u2013 unmistakably low, dangerous \u2013 was the voice of my childhood reveries and the prepubescent inkling that being bad could be good. I am not alone. Stop the average thirtysomething in the street and boom: \u201cContenders \u2026 ready!\u201d at them and they will respond: \u201cGladiators \u2026 ready!\u201d with religious zeal. But before Gladiators became an unstoppable cultural force that caused grownups to go completely gaga, it was London Weekend Television\u2019s flagship light-entertainment show.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The money for Gladiators was pathetic\u2019 ... Wolf meets fans at Stoke Con Trent. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nLaunched in 1992, it gave PAs, chartered surveyors and mums from Liverpool the chance to bash athletic superstars with giant pugil sticks in the National Indoor Arena (now Arena Birmingham). This was the golden age of Saturday-night TV, a prelapsarian period when Noel Edmonds and our Cilla ruled the airwaves, when there were only four channels (until the arrival of Channel 5 in 1997) and the Wolfman and Mr Blobby would face off in the weekly ratings battle. It came to an end in 2000, when LWT cancelled the show due to falling ratings. The gladiators disbanded. But when you have been a gladiator in the foam and the muck of Saturday-night telly, where do you go?\n\nIn Wolf\u2019s case, New Zealand. When the panto bookings and personal appearance gigs dried up \u2013 no more rainy Wednesday mornings opening branches of Argos \u2013 he opened a chain of gyms. He needed to earn a living \u2013 they all did. \u201cThe money for Gladiators was pathetic,\u201d says Wolf, now 67. Unlike the gladiators on the US version of the show, none of the British stars received repeat fees; mostly, they made money from corporate gigs. Because Wolf was the star of the show, he got the most work, which caused some resentment among his colleagues.\n\nBut none of that tension is on display the following day at the comic convention Stoke Con Trent. Children take photos with Iron Man and a man in a Chewbacca outfit drinking coffee. Bradley from S Club 7 sits behind a folding table, charging \u00a35 for selfies and \u00a315 for a signed photo. At the back of the room, four gladiators \u2013 Cobra (Michael Anthony Willson), Lightning (Kim Betts), Wolf and fan favourite Jet (Diane Youdale) \u2013 are perched on stools. They chat away, referring to each other by their gladiator names. Taped above them are A4 printouts of the gladiators in their prime: glossy-maned and taut, faces unlined and hair backcombed to oblivion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s Jet that\u2019s famous. Diane is a private person\u2019 ... Jet hugs a fan at Stoke Con Trent. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad I haven\u2019t kicked the bucket,\u201d chuckles Cobra, his Gladiators costume straining over his chest. His cheery air and deep tan cannot hide the traces of his recent illness. (The 55-year-old was hospitalised with pneumonia earlier this year.) As I look at Cobra sitting underneath the photo of himself in his prime, his hair permed to a magnificent scrubbing brush, he intuits what I am thinking. \u201cI keep seeing people bringing photos of me from 20 years ago and it\u2019s depressing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what can you do?\u201d\n\nLeaning in, he lets me in on a secret: sometimes he would be drunk during filming. \u201cI remember looking at the Wall and thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to chase this guy up it and I\u2019m bleeding drunk.\u2019\u201d He almost got fired by the producer Nigel Lythgoe, but the crew stuck up for him. Not everyone was as lackadaisical. \u201cHunter, the swot, would be up there early in the morning, practising on the Wall. That\u2019s why he used to catch everyone!\u201d He breaks off to sign an autograph.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I think I\u2019m the most successful gladiator! I\u2019ve been very lucky\u2019 ... Rhino (Mark Smith) in his heyday. Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nAt Jet\u2019s table, business is brisk, as I expected it to be: she was the show\u2019s heart-throb. I am struck by how vulnerable many of her \u2013 mostly male \u2013 fans seem to be. One man\u2019s hands shake as he unpacks a plastic wallet full of photographs for signing. Another presents her with a handmade twine bracelet, which she accepts graciously. Although she spends a long time chatting with fans and seems genuinely invested in their stories, watching some of them part with money in exchange for autographs and photos makes me uneasy.\n\nAfter the event, I catch up with Jet at her hotel. Dressed in a chunky jumper, her hair still in that famous side-sweep, Jet appears tired from the day\u2019s exertions \u2013 I recognise a fellow introvert \u2013 and rarely makes eye contact. She trained as a choreographer before being recruited for the show at 22. (She is now 49.) Fame was jarring. \u201cIt was weird,\u201d she laughs, face in hands. \u201cBeing famous was never on my trajectory.\u201d What was it like, being the show\u2019s sex symbol? \u201cI hated it. You know how I\u2019d do the hair flick and cartwheels and the funny naff dancing? There was a reason for it. When the camera was coming to me, I wouldn\u2019t stand still \u2026 When you\u2019re moving, people can\u2019t look at your cellulite.\u201d\n\nJet left the show in 1996, after sustaining a neck injury falling from the Pyramid. (It was notorious for injuries \u2013 Amazon, Rhino and Wolf also injured themselves there.) She tried presenting, before qualifying as a psychotherapist. Her training enabled her to reflect critically on her fame. \u201cThere is something that happens in that moment where someone discovers you are famous \u2026 You can\u2019t be who you genuinely are.\u201d She is thankful that most people know her by the Jet persona, not her real name. \u201cIt\u2019s Jet that\u2019s famous. Diane is a private person.\u201d\n\nLooking back, it is easy to forget the level of fame the gladiators enjoyed. Rhino \u2013 real name Mark Smith \u2013 got recognised on safari in Zimbabwe. \u201cWe were in the Land Rover and someone leaned over and said: \u2018Eh, Rhino, do you think we might see a rhino?\u2019\u201d (They did.) He is speaking on the phone from Los Angeles, where he works as an actor and producer. \u201cI think I\u2019m the most successful gladiator!\u201d Rhino laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky.\u201d He recently produced the forthcoming Orlando Bloom film The Outpost \u2013 and celebrated turning 50 by going skydiving.\n\n\u201cMy ambition is to get Hang Tough in churches,\u201d says Ace (Warren Furman) as we sit drinking coffee in the shadow of York Minster. That was the game in which gladiators swung themselves across the arena on a series of hanging rings. \u201cYou know how you do the communion? I reckon you should be able to Hang Tough your way straight up there. I think people would enjoy that.\u201d It takes me a few beats to realise he is serious \u2013 he has the equipment already and just needs to persuade a church to let him rig it up.\n\nI took a contract for the Ace biscuit, not knowing that the strapline was \u2018The incredibly thick chocolate biscuit\u2019 Ace (Warren Furman)\n\nAce, 47, became a born-again Christian five years ago and is charmingly self-aware about his conversion. \u201cThe other gladiators think I\u2019ve completely lost my mind.\u201d I like Ace \u2013 he is hilarious and sincere and doesn\u2019t try to convert me. He tells me about his 2017 appearance on This Morning, in which he announced he was a \u201cgladiator for the gospel\u201d. He had originally turned it down, until he realised it would be live. \u201cI thought: \u2018I can share the gospel live on telly!\u2019 I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nWhen Gladiators ended, he struggled to adapt. He chased celebrity for a while and dated Katie Price back when she was Jordan. After the celebrity work thinned out, he retrained as a construction manager. His labourers would ask him what Price was like in bed, or mock him for his McVitie\u2019s deal. (\u201cI took a contract for the Ace biscuit, not knowing that the strapline was \u2018The incredibly thick chocolate biscuit\u2019,\u201d he snorts. \u201cThat was the bane of my life.\u201d)\n\nFor a long time, he didn\u2019t like talking about the show. \u201cYou\u2019re remembering a time when you were earning loads of money and you had fame and fortune, and now it\u2019s gone. It was depressing.\u201d He is grateful to Gladiators for getting him off steroids. (The producers knew he was using them, but asked him to get \u201chis levels down\u201d after testing.) Now he sees Gladiators as an advantage for his Christian evangelism \u2013 he appears in schools dressed as a gladiator, spreading the good news.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You know how you do the communion? I reckon you should be able to Hang Tough your way straight up there\u2019 ... Ace (Warren Furman), pictured in 1995 and 2017, is now a Christian evangelist. Composite: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex\n\nBut his first attempt at proselytising in a primary school didn\u2019t go to plan. He had bought a plastic gladiator outfit from eBay, but it was cheap-looking and naff. \u201cThis kid comes up to me, grabs the plastic sword and taps it. He goes: \u2018You ain\u2019t a real gladiator.\u2019 I was like: I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d After that debacle, Ace prayed: \u201cI said: \u2018Father, you need to get me something \u2026 You need to get me some proper gladiator armour.\u2019\u201d The prayer was soon answered: Ace found an original costume from the 2000 Russell Crowe film Gladiator on Gumtree, for \u00a360.\n\nEarlier, standing in the cathedral\u2019s crypt, Ace tells me about the mass grave of Roman gladiators that was unearthed nearby. Whether physical or psychological, a gladiator always pays a price. Ace recalls standing on the arena floor during the 2015 Gladiators reunion. \u201cIt was melancholy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were all ringing each other afterwards and saying: \u2018Remember when we were young?\u2019\u201d\n\nYes: I remember the gladiators when they were young and in their prime, godlike in the rubber and foam of 90s entertainment TV. I need only to close my eyes and I am eight again, crossed-legged on the floor, palms slick with excitement. On the telly, a gladiator stretches a hand towards the next hanging ring.
