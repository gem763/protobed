Come on, it was 100 per cent a penalty, nothing else, But VAR was not clear enough to say 'Overrule it'.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\n\"We need to discuss it in general, because how the process works is important. I think it is good, VAR. The only way it really works is handball and offside.\n\n\"But the process where the ref makes a decision because they have VAR but then VAR says 'No, that's fine', that doesn't work.\n\n\"On the pitch the referee decides to let it run because we have VAR, but it is not overruled because it is not 'obvious'... that makes no sense.\"", "description": "Salah missed Sunday's 1-1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford due to an ankle injury", "authors": ["Jacob Murtagh", "Image", "Liverpool Fc", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585075.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
