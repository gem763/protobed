Allen remains in his position as the franchise\u2019s public face and Snyder\u2019s top football lieutenant. He is in charge of securing a new stadium, which Snyder prefers to build in the District and is the most pressing issue facing a franchise hemorrhaging fans and that routinely sees FedEx Field seats filled with the opposing team\u2019s colors.\n\nAllen spoke for the franchise Monday afternoon and offered optimistic resolve and half-truths. At the end of his news conference, Allen was asked why nothing had worked to create sustained success during Snyder\u2019s two decades as owner, despite trying so many different kinds of coaching hires.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the premise that it\u2019s never,\u201d Allen said. \u201cLast year at this time, we\u2019re in first place and we\u2019re doing well, so it was working pretty damn good. Unfortunately, our quarterback [Alex Smith] got injured. The pieces are here for a winning team. We have to put them in the right place, believe in each other, and keep fighting for our goal. There\u2019s only one way you win. You have to work. You have to get better, and you have to beat your opponent. And that\u2019s what we have to do. And I believe these players and these coaches will do that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nAllen has become an object of disdain for Washington\u2019s disgruntled fans, many of whom have circulated a #FireBruceAllen hashtag on social media. When asked specifically about Washington\u2019s culture under his watch, Allen defended it.\n\n\u201cThese people care,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe have a very young core of players that we have brought in here who are accustomed to winning. \u2026 In free agency we brought in [safety] Landon Collins, a great leader, a great player, wants to win. We haven\u2019t put it together. We\u2019ve made too many mistakes on game day. But the effort \u2014 the effort of the players and the rest of this organization is fantastic. [Personnel executive] Doug Williams, his hours, if you want to check his time card, working all the time. Our scouts on the road, working all the time. And they\u2019re trying to find the right formula for success. These players have the ability, and we just have to execute it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Washington fired top marketing executive Brian Lafemina eight months after hiring him. Many around the franchise and close to Lafemina believe Allen\u2019s undermining led to Lafemina\u2019s ouster. After his departure, which led to Allen returning to overseeing both the football and business sides of the franchise, roughly 40 business-side employees left the organization.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAllen faced several questions regarding his accountability and why he should remain in control of the franchise\u2019s direction. Allen said he would not \u201chide\u201d from Washington\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is work,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd do I believe in the group that\u2019s here? Yes. I think Doug and Kyle [Smith] had a great draft. I think they\u2019ve had a few great drafts. I see what the coaches are trying to accomplish. I see what the people do at the stadium. They\u2019re great workers. They care about this team. They care about this franchise. And I\u2019m not saying I care more than anyone, but I absolutely want what\u2019s best for the Washington Redskins, and we\u2019re going to make sure we do it.\"\n\nFrom 2018: A once-proud franchise, the Redskins are showing signs of foundational cracks\n\nAllen\u2019s most important task is securing land for a new stadium by 2027, when Washington\u2019s lease obligating it to play at FedEx Field runs out. Across the league, some believe Allen\u2019s experience will enable him to secure a stadium. Others are skeptical that his connections will be enough.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand; this guy can\u2019t understand the football side, but he\u2019s going to run a stadium development?\u201d a high-ranking NFL team executive said this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to run a team on its own. \u2026 You need somebody that has real estate expertise. You need somebody that has political expertise. I just don\u2019t see that being Bruce.\u201d\n\nOn the football side, Allen has spearheaded Washington\u2019s strategy in dealing with offensive tackle Trent Williams, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection who is holding out because of concerns over how Washington\u2019s training staff diagnosed and treated a growth on his head.\n\nAllen\u2019s strategy has been to wait out Williams as fines and missed paychecks pile up. Williams could fetch a draft pick, likely a second-rounder, in a trade. But Allen said he has had \u201cno dialogue\u201d with other teams and that he is not considering trading Williams.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSnyder made no comments regarding Gruden\u2019s ouster and was not present at Monday afternoon\u2019s news conference. When asked why Snyder wasn\u2019t there, Allen replied, \u201cBecause I am.\u201d Allen was asked whether Snyder would address the franchise\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cYeah, Dan makes himself available from time to time,\u201d Allen said.\n\nSnyder rarely speaks publicly and has not granted an interview to a non-Redskins-affiliated outlet in years. This summer, through a New York-based public relations firm, Snyder agreed to an interview with The Post if the Q&A ran in place of a story about his 20th anniversary of his purchase of the team, an arrangement The Post declined.\n\nAD\n\nAnd so it was Allen who on Monday explained the state of a woebegone franchise. He promoted Washington\u2019s culture, and then he was asked how that culture translated into winning games.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThrough winning football games,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe have to win. We didn\u2019t win any of these games.\u201d\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nBill Callahan calls Redskins\u2019 interim job \u2018different territory\u2019; won\u2019t start Dwayne Haskins yet\n\nThe Redskins are starting over after firing Jay Gruden, but in what direction are they headed?\n\nPlayers react: \u2018Sorry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you\u2019\n\nHail or Fail: Jay Gruden\u2019s final game as Redskins coach was another dud\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field\n\nAD", "description": "After firing coach Jay Gruden, Washington's team president offered a rosy outlook for the franchise's future.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2PSu_cpVIBU_ARFxuXNIqmxR3UM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YIOH2PXJE4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
