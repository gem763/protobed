Photo: Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Moet & Chandon\n\nThe Iron Lady, long may that saucy minx reign! Gillian Anderson has signed on to play former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Netflix\u2019s The Crown, which is excellent news, and will serve as the chaser for this somewhat bad news: The show confirmed on social media that she won\u2019t be appearing until the fourth season, meaning we\u2019ll likely have to wait about a year and a half until she pops up in our queues. (Hey, as much as we\u2019d like to change the course of history to get her on sooner, we just can\u2019t. She gets elected in 1979!) \u201cThatcher was undoubtedly formidable but I am relishing exploring beneath the surface and, dare I say,\u201d Anderson said in a statement, \u201cfalling in love with the icon who, whether loved or despised, defined an era.\u201d At least season three will bring us various new characters, such as a young Camilla Parker Bowles, a potentially too-hot Prince Charles, and, well, the entire royal family. Rule Britannia when the season premieres on November 17.\n\nGillian Anderson will play Margaret Thatcher in The Crown Season Four, now in production. pic.twitter.com/OVCO8o2bVk \u2014 The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) September 7, 2019", "description": "Gillian Anderson will be playing Margaret Thatcher on the upcoming seasons of Netflix\u2019s The Crown, in a nice casting move.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/20/20-gillian.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
