That moved Syracuse up a notch to No. 21 in this week\u2019s AP Top 25 as the Orange began preparing for a second straight outing on the road - against Big Ten foe Maryland (1-0) on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest difference between good defenses and bad defenses is how the back end tackles,\u201d Babers said Monday during his weekly news conference. \u201cYou can normally get enough tough guys in the front seven, but if you get some tough guys in the back four, then you\u2019ve got a real defense.\u201d\n\nAndre Cisco, who led the nation last year as a freshman with seven interceptions, and Ifeatu Melifonwu each had an interception to pace the secondary, while redshirt junior nose tackle Josh Black had four tackles, including a personal-best two sacks, and recovered a fumble, a performance that earned him Atlantic Coast Conference defensive lineman of the week honors. Overall, the defense had eight sacks among its 14 tackles for a loss of 51 total yards and held Liberty to minus-4 yards rushing in 34 attempts.\n\nThe coach was duly impressed by the latter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big, big feather, and that\u2019s why I used the word great,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThe defense did a great job.\u201d\n\nThe offense? OK at best.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Tommy DeVito completed 17 of 35 passes for 176 yards and two interceptions in his first game as a starter. He also was sacked twice and rushed for 21 yards on six carries. Babers attributed instances of apparent miscommunication between DeVito and his receiving corps to injuries during preseason camp to receivers Trishton Jackson, Taj Harris and Nykeim Johnson that forced them to miss time.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best football,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cEvery week going forward we\u2019re going to get better. I\u2019ve definitely got to take care of the ball, especially in the red-zone situations. We\u2019re going to learn from it and move forward.\u201d\n\nBrimming with confidence after accumulating more practice experience than most newcomers and twice rescuing the Orange last season in relief of former starter Eric Dungey, DeVito showed off his strong right arm late in the first quarter with an ill-advised bomb from near midfield on fourth down that was intercepted near the goal line. The other pick came on a pass to the back corner of the end zone just before halftime that was tipped at the line.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a gunslinger, and he wants to go out there and take everybody on,\u201d Babers said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sitting there going, hey, it\u2019s cool to be a gunslinger, but the best gunslingers are old gunslingers, and the way you become an old gunslinger is you don\u2019t take everybody on. You take the guys on that you have to.\u201d\n\nSyracuse also had a lost fumble by Sean Riley on a punt return early in the game, but special teams remain a strong point. Andre Szmyt, picked as the best placekicker in the nation last season, converted a 45-yard field goal, his only attempt of the game, and made every extra point. Sterling Hofrichter averaged 49.2 yards on six punts, placing four inside the Liberty 20-yard line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fired up about our defense,\u201d Babers said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s going to tell me I\u2019m going to have a nice defense and really nice special teams and the thing that had to get better was offense, I\u2019ll play those cards.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Hank Kurz in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Syracuse coach Dino Babers knew what he had before the season started - a stout defense and a quarterback who's going to have to learn on the job.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/syracuse_liberty_football_64002_c60-0-3356-1922_s1770x1032.jpg?ad82ab3bcff35310cf71d6af42996e9fe433e6cf"}
