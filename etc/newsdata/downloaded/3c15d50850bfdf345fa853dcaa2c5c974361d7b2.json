Mesa, a former president who has united opposition parties on the left and right against Morales, has accused him of election fraud.\n\nAD\n\nMorales, who has led the South American nation for 13 years, has warned of a \u201ccoup attempt\u201d to deprive him of a fourth term in office. But he also has invited the Organization of American States, the United States, Mesa and others to audit the vote. If the OAS finds evidence of fraud, Morales has said, he\u2019ll agree to a second round of voting.\n\nThe Trump administration and others have withheld recognition of the result pending the audit. Mesa, meanwhile, says the audit could be useful but shouldn\u2019t be considered the final word on the vote. Opposition protesters are no longer demanding a second round \u2014 they want a new election.\n\nMesa said Tuesday the opposition would continue to mobilize \u201cuntil we achieve a path that leads to the exit of Evo Morales from the presidency in January 2020.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMorales has warned that if protests continued, his rural supporters would besiege Bolivia\u2019s cities, \u201cto see if they can put up with it.\u201d\n\nThe developments in some ways resemble the sequence of events that led to the current standoff in Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a Morales ally, claimed victory last year in elections widely viewed as fraudulent. The United States withdrew recognition of Maduro, declared opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader and imposed economic sanctions on the already collapsing nation.\n\nA key difference is that Morales, who has presided over historic growth in one of the region\u2019s most impoverished nations, remains popular in Bolivia. Maduro, the heir to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, has little support in his country.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMorales still has popularity and strength, and it remains possible that he will agree to go to a second round,\u201d Amherst College political scientist Javier Corrales said. \u201cHe could still mobilize his base and stand a good chance.\u201d\n\nMorales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, has taken a more pragmatic approach in economic and foreign policy, maintaining good relations with most of the West and keeping the country open to foreign investment.\n\nThe elections tribunal says Morales beat Mesa by more than 10 percentage points in last week\u2019s vote, enough to avoid a runoff election in December. But that was after an unexplained gap in posting results that lasted nearly 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPreliminary returns after the polls closed Oct. 20 suggested the race was headed for a runoff, which analysts said Mesa had a strong chance of winning. When new results were posted the next day, the tally had swung in Morales\u2019s favor.\n\nMorales\u2019s candidacy itself was controversial: After losing a referendum in 2016 that would have allowed him to sidestep term limits, he secured a court ruling that enabled him to run again anyway.\n\nProtesters in La Paz and other cities last week set fires, looted election offices and tore down a statue of Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nBolivian officials say the OAS audit is expected to start in the coming days. The United States, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia have refrained from recognizing Morales and won\u2019t if the OAS \u201cis not able to verify results of the first round,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned over irregularities in the vote-counting process of #Bolivia\u2019s Oct 20 elections,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Sunday. \u201cWe call on #Bolivia to restore electoral integrity by proceeding to a 2nd round of free, fair, transparent, & credible elections with the top two vote winners.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations has backed the OAS audit; the European Union has called for a second round of voting.\n\nObservers have not been announced for the audit. Morales has mentioned the United States, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.\n\nBut opposition protesters say they won\u2019t be bound by the results.\n\n\u201cPeople view the OAS audit as just a slogan,\u201d Pablo Sol\u00f3n, a former ambassador under Morales who has turned against the president, told The Washington Post. \u201cNo one even understands how it works or when it will start or end.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe National Coordinator for the Defense of Democracy, a committee of opposition parties and civil society groups, has said a second round wouldn\u2019t stop what it has labeled the \u201cmother of all battles\u201d to pressure for a new vote.\n\nMesa, speaking to reporters in Santa Cruz on Tuesday, said that \u201cnew elections would be ideal\u201d but that the opposition is \u201copen to all options.\u201d\n\nSol\u00f3n, the ambassador turned critic, said the government\u2019s strategy was clear.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re instigating fear by having their supporters come out and clash with protesters while they also bet that the strength of the movement will wear out in the coming weeks,\u201d he said.", "description": "The socialist president says he has won a fourth term but will agree to a second round of voting if fraud is found.
