From Camille Lopez\u2019s kick-off the winger chased hard, leapt, batted back the ball with a strong right arm, and after a ruck France booted the ball out to sighs of relief.\n\nThey had made the knockout stages, stumbling into the quarter-finals with England from Pool C \u2013 maintaining their record of never missing the last eight at a World Cup.\n\nIt would have been not only a seismic shock, but the biggest World Cup turnaround ever if Tonga had done it \u2013 they trailed 17-0 after half an hour.\n\nIt was a start typical of France at this tournament. Fast, clinical, excellent. First Camille Chat pounced on a dodgy lineout, France went wide, Alivereti Raka stepped in off his left foot, beat a man and then popped to Virimi Vakatawa to finish off.\n\nFrance's wing Damian Penaud goes over the whitewash but his try is later disallowed\n\nThe eye-catching Kumamoto Stadium will host Wales' final pool game against Uruguay too\n\nIt was lost on no-one that two Pacific Islanders had injected the pizzazz into the French against Tonga.\n\nRaka scored the next. A sensational effort. A quickly-tapped penalty from Baptiste Serin and the scrum-half put Raka away. The Fijian-born Frenchman chipped over his winger, regathered on the other side and raced in.\n\nGoodnight Tonga? Not a bit of it.\n\nThey scored next \u2013 lots of close-range phases ending with Tane Takulua diving in to score. That made it 17-7 at the break, with Takulua converting his try, Romain Ntamack hitting an early penalty.\n\nThen, as is the theme of their tournament, French progress slowed after the resumption.\n\nFrance scrum-half Antoine Dupont battles through a couple of sturdy Tongan defenders\n\nAfter France had a lovely try disallowed for a forward pass from Wenceslas Lauret to Charles Ollivon Tonga took themselves within striking distance.\n\nCooper Vuna repeated the Raka trick by chipping ahead and racing through. Maxime Medard looked to have it covered, but the bobbling ball evaded him and Malietoa Hingano was first to it bashing through the blue shirts to score.\n\nHe roared his approval. Takulua converted. It was on.\n\nSo nervous of an upset were the French that they decided to kick their next two penalties, taking the three points each time to give themselves a buffer. Ntamack calmly slotted the goals.\n\nThen another disallowed try. Penaud thought he had turned out the lights on Tonga, but on reflection Medard had fumbled in the build-up.\n\nGuilhem Guirado, who plays at hooker for France, salutes the crowd after the tight victory\n\nThat chalking off gave Tonga their chance \u2013 they took the late score, but it was not enough.\n\nFor a country with a population of 108,000 \u2013 about the same as Saint-Denis, the suburb of Paris \u2013 and seeing as they have up to 20 of their best players unavailable as they have stayed with clubs, it was a remarkable effort.\n\nEngland, who France play next to end the pool, will be licking their lips \u2013 as will Wales, who look likely to play the French in the quarter-final.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN KUMAMOTO: France made the knockout stages, stumbling into the quarter-finals with England from Pool C - maintaining their record of never missing the last eight at a World Cup.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/11/19358138-0-image-a-46_1570357952496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
