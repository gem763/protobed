With Regis and Kelly.\"\n\nPhilbin was brought up during \"The Howard Stern Show\" with guest Jimmy Kimmel, who mentioned he would be on the re-named talk show \"Live with Kelly and Ryan.\"\n\n\"Well, Kelly (Ripa) I don\u2019t think likes Regis. That\u2019s the thing. They have a war,\u201d Stern said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d Kimmel laughed.\n\n\u201cI think it is true, I think she would say that it\u2019s true,\u201d Stern persisted. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk or anything as far as I know. I thought it was an issue where Kelly felt that she should\u2019ve been told by Regis that he was leaving the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Regis left on his own accord,\u201d co-host Robin Quivers chimed in.\n\n\u201cNo, Regis didn\u2019t leave on his own accord,\u201d Kimmel added, which brought an end to the discussion.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Larry King, Regis Philbin revealed that he hasn't stayed in touch with Ripa since he left the show in 2011.\n\n\"She got very offended when I left,\" he told King. \"She thought I was leaving because of her. I was leaving because I was getting older and it wasn't right for me anymore.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to WABC for comment.\n\nMore: Kathie Lee Gifford reveals what Regis Philbin said about her 'Today' exit\n\nEarlier in the show, Stern asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think they should have Regis on that show once a year at least? I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t.\"\n\n\u201cWhy the abandonment?\u201d Quivers added.\n\n\u201cYou think he still wants to be on?\u201d Kimmel asked.\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Stern replied. \u201cI think he would\u2019ve liked to at least be associated in some way with the show and remind people that he\u2019s the guy who started that whole thing.\u201d\n\nKimmel said he wasn't sure of Philbin's feelings about it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t spoken to him about this. I would be curious,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his interview with King, Philbin said he hadn't been invited back to the show.\n\nBut in a statement at that time to USA TODAY Dave Davis, the president and general manager of WABC, which produces \"Live,\" contradicted that claim.\n\n\"It was wonderful to have Regis on the show for our 2015 Halloween special,\" Davis noted. \"He\u2019s also been invited back several times as a guest, and in fact was confirmed for a date, but was not able to make it at the time.\"\n\nContributing: Jayme Deerwester\n\nMore: Beth Stern agrees to remarry Howard Stern after surprise proposal on 'Jimmy Kimmel'\n\nMore: Howard Stern re-marries wife Beth Stern on 'Ellen,' kisses host to distract from Bush uproar\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/howard-stern-regis-philbin-kelly-ripa-relationship-jimmy-kimmel-interview/4063402002/", "description": "Howard Stern is sharing his thoughts on Regis Philbin leaving \"Live!
