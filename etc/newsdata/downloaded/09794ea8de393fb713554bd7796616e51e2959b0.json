The account page says it\u2019ll address \u201ctips, tricks, updates, IGTV, BTS (behind-the-scenes), access, insights, and tutorials.\u201d Instagram-chosen creators, including dancer Susie Meoww and comedian Adam Waheed, will walk people through their process for creating content and offer advice that ranges from the equipment they use to the sound effects they like. The page also seemingly serves as a FAQ for Instagram. Its first Story highlight answers basic questions about verification, the algorithmic feed, and comment filtering.\n\nThe account unsurprisingly focuses on IGTV, the longform video arm of Instagram and a focus point for the company. Justin Antony, head of content and creator partnerships at Instagram, says the talent they choose to highlight \u201cembodied best practices and creation on the platform,\u201d especially around IGTV.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want to create content just to create, though. Most aspiring creators want to make a career out of it. So far, Instagram hasn\u2019t given anyone a native way to make money on the platform, although Antony told The Verge in April that IGTV will be the first place the company monetizes. In a call last week, however, he said the platform isn\u2019t \u201cthere yet.\u201d In the meantime, people should keep making content for it, though.\n\nOf course, creators worry about topics other than making money, like bullying, mental health, and burnout. Brooke Ozaydinli, Instagram product marketing manager, says the account will also touch on these topics in addition to how to make money on the platform, even if it isn\u2019t Instagram-sanctioned. \u201cWe\u2019ve really been trying to focus on creative best practices, so focusing on the inspirational content creation aspect of being a creator,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re going to shy away entirely from branded opportunities, but the real focus is: how do you up level as a creator?\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to talking about negative comments, Ozaydinli points out that one creator might choose to talk about Instagram\u2019s comment filtering and how that can help. She also says, depending on the creator, they can talk about burnout or how they maintain a personal life while churning out content. Granted, there\u2019s not an Instagram feature to help with that, so it\u2019s unclear how Instagram creators will encourage people to take time for themselves. When I met comedian Waheed at Instagram\u2019s Los Angeles office last April, I was genuinely worried about his health. He told me he didn\u2019t really take vacations unless they were sponsored. That\u2019s not good!\n\nWhile creators need a space on the platform to learn about new product features and to get to know their favorite accounts, I hope Instagram doesn\u2019t shy away from the real questions people have, whether it\u2019s related to burnout and taking a content-making break or how to make money without coming up with something that might be considered a \u201cscam.\u201d", "description": "Instagram launched a new creators-focused account called @creators that\u2019ll give people a place to learn from their favorite creators, including tips and tricks.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMTEJdurRXd1m4exHU-d_kEQiEg=/0x0:1870x979/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19245608/Screen_Shot_2019_09_30_at_8.50.05_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
