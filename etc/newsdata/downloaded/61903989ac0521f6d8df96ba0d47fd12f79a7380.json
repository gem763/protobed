The company says says it may bring Preventive Health in other countries and cover more healthcare topics if it sees users engaging with it.\n\n'We're going to spend the next six to 12 months really trying to understand whether people are engaging with this tool and whether it's helpful or not,' Dr Abnousi told CNN.\n\n'Once we figure that out is when we're going to start thinking about expansion.'\n\nNews of the tool comes just four months after Facebook rolled out a new feature in the US that tell users where to donate blood near them or if a blood donation is in need.\n\nThe social media platform has also promoted organ donations by asking users to share if they are registered donors.\n\nFacebook is far from the only tech giant to foray into the healthcare marketplace with Apple's smartwatches helping monitor heartbeats and cardiovascular irregularities and Amazon buying buying online pharmacy PillPack.", "description": "Facebook launched the feature, called Preventive Health, on Monday, in which users enter their age and sex and are given recommendations such as a blood pressure test or a cancer screening.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345572-0-image-a-26_1572381497446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
