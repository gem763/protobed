And your silence is supporting him in not standing up,\u201d Amy Haskins, an Iowa resident, said.\n\n\u201cWhere is the line? When are you guys going to say \u2018Enough,\u2019 and stand up and say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m not backing any of this.\u201d\n\nMs Ernst replied: \u201cThe president is going to say what the president is going to do.\u201d\n\nSome senators, conscious of widespread support for Mr Trump among Republicans, have struck a more cautious note.", "description": "Republican senators are becoming increasingly unnerved by Donald Trump\u2019s conduct, as national support for impeachment rises.Democrats have launched a formal impeachment inquiry, over concerns the president pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WprAC0iD7XdOj_SkYZaiog--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/960c213c35a4364db805adeaac682adc", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
