In recent weeks, prosecutors carried out several raids linked to Ms Cho's family.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing last Friday, Mr Cho expressed his \"deepest apologies to the younger generation\" over the alleged perks his daughter received. But said he said he wanted to get on with reforms to the justice system.\n\nMr Moon has stressed there has been no confirmation of illegal action and said it would be bad precedent not to appoint someone solely on the basis of allegations.\n\nBut the case has caused a public debate about class privilege in South Korea, which has been rocked by corruption scandals over recent years.\n\nThe previous government was toppled over corruption allegations and former President Park Geun-hye is currently serving prison time for bribery and abuse of power.\n\nMr Hwang served as prime minister under former President Pak - some observers have suggested his public stunt was in part motivated to undermine current President Moon Jae-in.\n\nWhy shave the head?\n\nSouth Korea has a long tradition of hair shaving as a form of protest.\n\nThe act is rooted in traditional Confucian teaching, and has historically been seen as a way of demonstrating commitment to a cause.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, when South Korea was under military dictatorship, dissidents would often shave their heads as a sign of resistance.\n\nOver the past decades, activists and politicians have used it as way to protest.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption These women shaved their heads to protest against the rise of spycam porn\n\nIn 2018, women shaved their head at a march against the rise of spy cameras being placed in toilets and changing rooms to secretly film women.\n\nTwo years before, more than 900 South Koreans shaved their heads in a show of protests at a US anti-missile system\n\nIn 2007, hundreds of residents of Icheon City shaved their heads over a controversy where to build a new industrial plant.\n\nMr Hwang's public stand took place outside the presidential palace, the Blue House, on Monday evening.\n\nReferring to Mr Cho as \"criminal\" he urged him to stand down.\n\nHe told the crowd watching: \"I'm here to pledge my determination by shaving my head. I will not step back.\"\n\nHis protest drew wide attention on social media. He made it into the top 10 trending list on Naver, South Korea's number one search engine.\n\nMany comments likened his looks to actor Gary Oldman - earning him the nickname Kimchi Oldman.", "description": "Allegations of corruption linked to a justice minister have renewed a traditional form of protest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6E53/production/_108834282_hi056541948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
