Jerry Nadler of New York, California Rep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me,\" Trump wrote. \"Oh well, maybe next time!\"\n\nTrump's mention of \"Do Nothing Democrats\" was a recycling of a dig he's used in the past to describe the party. The addition of the word \"Savages\" to describe two Jewish lawmakers and four female lawmakers of color who he previously told to \"go back\" to their \"corrupt\" and \"broken and crime infested\" countries of origin (only one was born outside of the US) set off criticism saying the tweet was racist and anti-Semitic.\n\nHe followed the dig up with tweets containing several of his signature phrases, in which he insisted \"KEEP AMERICA GREAT!,\" \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\" and \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\"\n\nTrump's tweet is the latest reaction from the president since he's come under scrutiny for a whistleblower complaint that detailed an official's concerns about Trump's contact with foreign leaders, specifically a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky concerning a possible investigation into the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump urged the foreign leader to investigate Biden, who is currently a frontrunner in the 2020 Election, and his son just days after Trump withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.\n\nRead more: Here's the truth about the allegations involving Joe Biden's son and Ukraine drummed up by Trump and Rudy Giuliani\n\nTrump dismissed initial reports surrounding the complaint, saying that he has \"conversations with many leaders.\"\n\n\"It's always appropriate, always appropriate,\" Trump said of his conversations. \"At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\"\n\nHouse Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry on September 24 over the allegations that Trump used the interaction for his own political gain.\n\nAfter the explosive whistleblower complaint was released, Trump launched a similarly combative 30-post tweetstorm 24 hours as the administration took an apparently unconcerned stance amid outcry from lawmakers and intelligence officials.\n\nThe White House had insisted in statements that the president did nothing wrong, emphasizing that the complaint is based on secondhand information, but confirmed that Trump pushed a foreign government for investigations that would benefit him politically.", "description": "Lawmakers previously announced an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower complaint that detailed a phone call between Trump and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8f53302e22af0de117a625?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
