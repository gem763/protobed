The card is being offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs GS, +1.72% , marking the bank\u2019s first credit card offering, and card network Mastercard MA, -3.89%.\n\nPeople will be able to sign up for the card direct from their iPhone \u2014 to do so, they will need to have the latest version of the iOS software. They will be prompted to provide personal information including age, address and the last four digits of the Social Security number.\n\nThat information will then be sent to Goldman Sachs for approval, which should take less than a minute. If approved, people will be able to start using their card almost immediately with the Wallet app and Apple Pay. A physical card will also be mailed to these consumers, which they can then activate with their smartphone.\n\nIn a new TV advertising campaign for the credit card that ran Sunday during NFL games last Sunday, Apple said the card has no link to historical, and pejorative, banking stereotypes. \u201cApple Card is here. It\u2019s a new kind of credit card. Created by Apple \u2014 not a bank,\u201d according to the voice-over in the 30-second spot.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Apple announces iPhone 11, starting at $699\n\nIn hyping the new card, dubbed simply Apple Card, the tech giant played up a number of features. Card holders will earn 3% cash back on any Apple-related purchases, 2% back on anything bought with Apple Pay and 1% back on all transactions performed with the physical titanium card.\n\nCash-back rewards will accrue daily in the Apple Cash app: That money can be used to make purchases or for person-to-person payments with the app. Apple has also integrated new features into the Wallet app so that card holders can better track their spending and adjust card payments to fit their financial needs.\n\nThese and other features may seem flashy \u2014 but they\u2019ve already attracted some skeptics. For starters, other credit cards come with better rewards, including the U.S. Bank USB, +1.73% \u201cAltitude Reserve Visa Infinite\u201d card, which pays back 3% on all transactions completed via mobile pay.\n\n(Apple did not return a request for comment, and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story.)\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Investing app Stash launches debit rewards in an effort to attract more banking customers\n\nNevertheless, the card still seems poised to attract the attention of Apple devotees \u2014 those people who have the latest Macbook, iPhone and Apple Watch and are members of the device upgrade program.\n\nBut once you get past the splashy features, there\u2019s a lot Apple isn\u2019t telling consumers about its new credit card.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should watch out for:\n\nApple wants you to use mobile payments\n\nOK, maybe this isn\u2019t really a secret Apple is hiding \u2014 after all, why else would the card offer better rewards for purchases made through Apple Pay? Nevertheless, those planning to sign up for the Apple card should understand the company\u2019s reasoning for offering it in the first place.\n\nCurrently, Apple is fighting something of a losing battle when it comes to dominance in the mobile pay space. Apple Pay has only 32 million users, according to research from Richard Crone, a consultant in the payments industry. That\u2019s only slightly more than the number of people who use Walmart Pay (31 million) WMT, -0.24% and the Starbucks app (25 million) SBUX, -4.05%. And it\u2019s far fewer than the number of people who use PayPal PYPL, -2.26% and its person-to-person payments subsidiary Venmo (267 million).\n\nAnd payments experts have expressed skepticism that Americans will adopt mobile pay with the same fervor as their peers in other countries, especially China. \u201cMobile payments have grown glacially because in a lot of ways people don\u2019t see a compelling reason to use them instead of just breaking out the old plastic card,\u201d said Matt Schulz, industry analyst with personal-finance website CompareCards.\n\nOthers have argued that the Apple card could be a watershed moment, thanks in part to the financial management services Apple is adding to the Wallet app. \u201cIt is empowering financial services at the most basic level,\u201d Crone said. \u201cWhat the iPod was to the music industry, and what the iPhone was for cell phones and mobile carriers, so is the Apple Card to financial services.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs isn\u2019t selling your data, but...\n\nPrivacy was one of the major selling points in Apple\u2019s presentation Monday. The titanium Apple Card notably won\u2019t include a card number \u2014 a choice aimed at curbing would-be criminals looking to steal credit card numbers to make unauthorized purchases. Additionally, Apple said that Goldman Sachs has agreed never to sell cardholders\u2019 data to third parties or use it for advertising.\n\nMobile payments have grown glacially because in a lot of ways people don\u2019t see a compelling reason to use them instead of just breaking out the old plastic card. Matt Schulz, industry analyst with personal-finance website CompareCards\n\nWhat Apple didn\u2019t say is that Goldman Sachs is keeping that data for its own uses. Ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement, some had predicted that Apple and Goldman Sachs would use the data they collect to make personalized loan offers to card holders.\n\nThat prediction, Crone said, has essentially come to fruition, because the financial management features basically allow people to customize their balance repayment terms. Apple and Goldman theoretically may go a step further in the future to offer installment loans to card holders for big purchases at the point of sale, using the information they\u2019ve collected and analyzed about consumers\u2019 spending habits.\n\nYou might experience some kinks with customer service\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time Apple has offered a co-branded card, it is Goldman Sachs\u2019 first credit card. And as the bank supporting the card, consumers could be in for a bumpy ride when it comes to customer service so long as this is still relatively new ground for Goldman.\n\n\u201cThis product has the potential to attract a lot of consumers really fast, but I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll be capable to deal with the customer-service demand,\u201d said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal-finance website WalletHub.\n\n****Apple has played up the ability to deal with account issues in real-time by texting with customer-service representatives. Nevertheless, Goldman and Apple will lack institutional knowledge when it comes to processing claims related to fraudulent charges.\n\nRead more: The phone number that secures your Facebook account isn\u2019t as safe as you think\n\nThe interest rate may not end up being that low\n\nApple describes it as \u201cthe first credit card that actually encourages you to pay less interest.\u201d And the website says the company\u2019s goal is \u201cto provide interest rates that are among the lowest in the industry.\u201d\n\nBut the fine print states that the variable annual percentage rates (APR) will range from 12.99% to 23.99% as of March 2019, based on creditworthiness.\n\nThe national average APR is currently 17.80%, according to CreditCards.com. In other words, consumers with stellar credit would get below average interest rates. Consumers with poor credit could easily find themselves stuck with a higher-than-average interest rate.\n\nMoreover, Apple has not specified whether it will set limits based on creditworthiness for who can even receive a card. \u201cPeople need to understand what their credit score is,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cThe last thing anyone wants is to apply for a card thinking they\u2019ll get a 12% rate and then get a 25% rate.\u201d\n\nThe rewards program could cause you to spend more money\n\nResearch has shown that mobile pay may cause people to spend more money to begin with. And when you layer rewards on top of that, it could quickly become a budget breaker.\n\nApple\u2019s promise of rewards accruing daily is somewhat unusual for the credit-card industry. And people hunting for savings might be led astray if they become too obsessed with what they\u2019re getting in cash back.\n\nConsumers will not benefit from a level playing field anymore. Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people don\u2019t get caught up seeing that cash-back come in every day,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cIt could be good for people who pay their balance in full, but the last thing anyone should do is overspend to get rewards.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of over-spending, while Apple claims it won\u2019t limit rewards, that\u2019s not entirely true. The Apple Cash card will still come with a credit limit \u2014 meaning that people won\u2019t be able to spend with abandon in search of cashback without making some credit card payments.\n\nApple wants to become a card network like Visa or MasterCard\n\nThe hype surrounding Apple Card may belie the tech company\u2019s true intentions. As Papadimitriou argues, Apple may not be looking to best its rivals like Google GOOGL, +0.04% and Samsung 005930, +0.21% in the smartphone space or PayPal in the mobile pay space.\n\nInstead, it could be looking to replace Visa V, -2.86% and Mastercard. \u201cWhy have the middle man?\u201d Papadimitriou said. Through this credit card, Apple could learn what it takes to manage a card network. If its goal of boosting mobile payment comes to fruition, Apple Pay could replace Visa or Mastercard when it comes to managing card transactions.\n\nNaturally, companies like Google, Samsung and Microsoft MSFT, -1.05% would wade into this pool were Apple to follow this path.\n\nHowever, this could reduce competition: Companies like Visa and Mastercard jockey when it comes to the fees they charge merchants for credit-card transactions. If the number of card networks were to shrink thanks to Apple\u2019s ambitions, the networks would have more leverage to charge higher fees. Those fees could then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nIn the near-term, Apple Card is already poised to work out better for Apple Pay users than most of their other credit cards. As Papadimitriou explains, there\u2019s nothing to stop Apple from stacking the deck in its favor. \u201cConsumers will not benefit from a level playing field anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated on Aug. 6, 2019.", "description": "As Apple begins rolling out the credit card, consumers should read the fine print.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG506_applec_ZG_20190327143123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-27"}
