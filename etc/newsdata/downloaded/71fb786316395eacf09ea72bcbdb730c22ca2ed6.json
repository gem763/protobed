What it also brings out is the unparalleled value of long-term observations of the Arctic. Only by keeping an eye on full arctic ecosystems can we understand the havoc brought by the changing climate.\"\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "An extreme snowfall event last year in northeast Greenland resulted in a major reproductive failure, scientists claim.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/arctic-snowfall-image-lars-holst-hansen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
