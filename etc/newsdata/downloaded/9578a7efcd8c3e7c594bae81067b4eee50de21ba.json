But thanks to iFixit\u2019s traditional teardown, we finally got a better idea of just how small those systems are. There may not be a notch, but the fact that Google managed to fit all of this stuff into the bezel in the first place is impressive.\n\nThe image below shows the whole chunk of the bezel: the left is an ambient light sensor, the middle is the top earpiece, and that small green / gray rectangle is the entire Soli radar assembly. There\u2019s plenty of other hardware in the bezel, too, including the camera and IR face unlock system, but it\u2019s all so compact that you get the sense that Google might have almost been able to offer a notched display of some kind while still packing in all this tech.\n\nThe teardown also reveals that the fancy 90Hz display is almost impossible to take out. According to iFixit, you\u2019ll have to take apart almost the entire phone to get it out, and the edge-to-edge display and huge amounts of adhesive used to hold it in place mean it\u2019ll be tough to get it out in one piece. (Although, if you\u2019re replacing the screen, it\u2019s probably already broken anyway.) Curiously, the display is also made by Samsung, which has yet to offer a 90Hz refresh rate on any of its own phones. But this might be a hint of what to expect from next year\u2019s Galaxy S11.\n\nAll told, the Pixel 4 isn\u2019t the most repairable phone for the average consumer: iFixit ranks it at a numerically coincidental 4 out of 10 on its \u201crepairability\u201d scale, meaning that you\u2019ll likely still want to let a pro handle your next broken screen.
