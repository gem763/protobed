The inactivity hasn\u2019t been his choice. Despite Bellator\u2019s efforts to get him booked, Nallo hasn\u2019t found much luck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how it happened again,\u201d Nallo said. \u201cWe signed four contracts this year, but MMA is crazy and stuff happens in the gym. And stuff happens to your opponents, so this is just how it worked out.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019d like to fight more than once per year, Nallo see the upside in infrequent competition. He\u2019s able ride a wave of momentum for longer, while improving his skills without taking damage he\u2019d sustain in a fight.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of guys when they get a bit of hype, their career just springboards and they jump up a level they\u2019re not ready for,\u201d Nallo said. \u201cYou see it all the time.\n\n\u201cGuys are 24 and fighting a world champion and he just gets totally blown up. And then everybody is like, \u2018That guy isn\u2019t as good as we thought he was.\u2019 That guy was as good as you thought he was. He just wasn\u2019t ready for the test. So I think potentially, it\u2019s been a nice upwards trajectory in competition for me just through having the stance as not getting fights as frequently as other guys.\u201d\n\nBellator 231 takes place Friday at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.
