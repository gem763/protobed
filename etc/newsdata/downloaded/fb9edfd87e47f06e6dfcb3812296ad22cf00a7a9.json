The effects of the rebound are particularly visible in California's largest-in-the-nation real estate markets, which are still far below the state's early 2018 peak and has occurred even though the nation's third largest real estate market by market cap, Texas, has experienced a downtrend during 2019.\n\nCalculated Risk's Bill McBride believes 2019 is on track to become the best year for new home sales in the U.S. since 2007. In our next chart, we've calculated the average market cap for the U.S. new home sales market for each year from 1975 through the year-to-date in 2019, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, to confirm that's the case.\n\n\n\nIn nominal terms, 2019 is on track to be the best year since 2006, which marked the beginning of the deflation phase of the first U.S. housing bubble. In inflation-adjusted terms, 2019 is on track to be the best year since 2007.", "description": "Preliminary and revised\u00a0data for the new home sales market indicates .10/09/2019 14:35:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Political", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
