The ensuing decades have proven his prediction to be spectacularly wrong. Workers in most developed nations still work around 40 hours a week, even more in some nations.\n\nIn response, a movement in support of a four-day work week has gained traction around the world. A number of U.S. firms have experimented with it and some labor unions are championing the idea. A financial firm in New Zealand was so pleased with the results of a trial that they adopted the policy full-time. The Labour Party in the United Kingdom is considering making a four-day week part of its platform. Several other European countries have taken steps to reduce the work hours of their citizens.\n\nThe specifics of how a four-day work week functions varies. Some firms limit workers to 32 hours a week without cutting their pay. Others have employees do four 10-hour days. All employees can be given the same day off, typically Friday, or staff members may stagger their free days.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThere\u2019s significant evidence that the modern economy is overly hard on workers. People actually get more done in less time if they\u2019re feeling less stressed and more rested. The policy could also help unemployment by creating opportunities for part-time workers to take on the leftover hours.\n\nProponents have also pointed to potential side benefits, like decreased environmental impact with one less day of commuters on the road. Some employees at firms that have tried a four-day work week have put their extra time toward activities like volunteering or helping in their communities.\n\nSkeptics of the idea argue that a four-day work week would create more stress for workers who may be asked to accomplish the same amount of work in fewer hours. Others say it would be expensive for businesses, who might respond by cutting other benefits, trimming salaries or laying off people to cut costs.\n\nA four-day work week, some argue, is unfeasible in those industries that require staff throughout the week. Others say it should be up to individual companies, rather than governments, to decide on working hours.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nWhile a few companies in the United States are trying out a four-day work week, a broad push is unlikely anytime soon. The policy is not currently part of the platform of any of the nation's prominent progressive parties. In the United Kingdom, Labour may soon back off its push, as well. Last week, a report commissioned by the party found that while limiting work hours is a worthwhile goal, a government-mandated four-day work week would be unrealistic and counterproductive.\n\nPerspectives\n\nSupporters\n\nHappier workers are more productive.\n\n\u201cIncreases in productivity likely go hand-in-hand with a more engaged workforce that feels healthier and less stressed. Certainly, the links between long working hours and elevated staff absence rates \u2013 both for mental and physical health problems \u2013 are well established.\u201d\n\n\u2014 David Prosser, Forbes\n\nShortening the work week is a fresh way for workers to exercise their collective power.\n\n\u201cTypically, critics of capitalism have called for redistributing the wealth it produces through higher taxes, government programs and a higher minimum wage. At least in theory, cutting working hours is another method of addressing the same problem \u2014 the unequal results of economic growth \u2014 but by reallocating time to workers, rather than money.\"\n\n\u2014 Jeff Stein, Washington Post\n\nA shorter work week would have broad mental and physical health benefits.\n\n\u201cIf we all worked a four-day week, there\u2019s good reason to assume that life expectancy, inequality and education scores could all go up.\u201d \u2014 Tim Smedley, BBC\n\nA four-day week would be good for the environment.\n\n\u201cThe exact magnitude of that reduction is unclear, but the research seems to point in the same direction: lowering the number of hours we work would help to reduce our impact on the environment.\u201d \u2014 Andre Spicer, The Guardian", "description": "A number of companies around the world are experimenting with a four-day work week that some say increases employee productivity and happiness.
