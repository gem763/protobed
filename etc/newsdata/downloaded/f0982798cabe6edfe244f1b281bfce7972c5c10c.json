Her trial is set to begin in summer 2020.\n\nThe class-action suit was filed in 2016 in Phoenix, where Theranos operated several blood-testing \"wellness centers\" out of Walgreens stores in the area. Holmes, Walgreens, and Theranos, who are also named as defendants, have all denied wrongdoing in the case. No trial date has been set.\n\nThe civil lawsuit in question is separate from the one involving criminal charges against Holmes that could result in jail time. In that case, the Department of Justice has charged Holmes and Theranos' former president, Sunny Balwani, with multiple counts of fraud. The charges stem from allegations that Holmes and Balwani, who hid that they were romantically involved for much of the time they headed Theranos, schemed to defraud the startup's investors, its doctors, and its patients while knowing that its test results were inaccurate and unreliable.\n\nThe trial in the criminal case is set to begin in July 2020. Both Holmes and Balwani could face up to 20 years in prison, as well as a $250,000 fine plus restitution for each charge, the government has said.\n\nThe lawyers defending Holmes in the criminal case did not respond to Business Insider's questions about whether they had been paid for their representation.", "description": "The lawyers said that given Elizabeth Holmes' \"current financial situation\" they don't expect to ever get paid for representing the Theranos founder.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d979169138e4a142324c6a2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
