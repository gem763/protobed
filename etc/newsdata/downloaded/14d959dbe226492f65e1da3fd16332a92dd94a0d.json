Photo: Magnolia Pictures\n\nWith a world tour with Eric Wareheim on the way and the 11th (!) season of his web series, On Cinema at the Cinema, currently streaming on AdultSwim.com, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Tim Heidecker is gearing up for a long vacation. Instead, this week sees the release of Mister America, a feature film that forms yet another constellation in the sprawling On Cinema universe that he\u2019s created with Gregg Turkington and director Eric Notarnicola over the last decade.\n\nA mockumentary supposedly made by a student filmmaker, Mister America finds Heidecker\u2019s character campaigning to be the district attorney of San Bernardino county, following a trial where he was dubiously cleared of over a dozen counts of murder after a hung jury resulted in a mistrial. (The trial itself streamed over multiple hours on Adult Swim\u2019s website.)\n\nHeidecker recently hopped on the phone with Vulture to chat about why the movie isn\u2019t just for On Cinema fanatics, how Nathan Fielder helped shape the film, and why he can\u2019t stand when publications label him an \u201canti-humorist.\u201d\n\nWith On Cinema, you have the podcast, the TV show, the web series, the music, the specials \u2014 at what point did you, Gregg, and Eric decide to toss a movie into the mix?\n\nThe trial was the first thing that felt like a different way to approach the universe and a way that On Cinema could exist outside of our control a little bit, as far as the way the viewer watched it. We thought it would be fun to follow up the trial with another kind of media that followed my character seeking revenge against the district attorney and exploring who that hung juror was going to be. So, the idea to treat it as a documentary that someone else might make came into being.\n\nWe proceeded with the idea that it would exist on the Adult Swim app or site as another thing that was like the trial, which was kind of hard to classify. Then as we started making it, in the edit room we realized that we had way more, and that it really all worked, and that it felt just like a movie. Honestly, after showing it to people as a rough, rough, rough cut, one person in particular, Nathan Fielder, who we all know \u2026\n\nYeah.\n\nHe had already come out of the experience of doing [the feature-length Nathan for You series finale] \u201cFinding Frances,\u201d where they had actually ended up making a movie, but it ended up on Comedy Central as this sort of nebulous thing that was hard to classify, but truly was a film. He was very passionate about it to us, saying, \u201cYou guys, stop what you\u2019re doing and think about how this could actually come out as a movie in a theatrical way, because it would be a shame if this just stopped here and just went on the web, you know?\u201d\n\nHow do you expect people who aren\u2019t familiar with On Cinema to react to the movie? Have you shown it to anyone who wasn\u2019t familiar with On Cinema yet?\n\nWe didn\u2019t do, like, blind stranger focus groups and that kind of thing. But we did show it to people that haven\u2019t kept up with all of our shenanigans. And everyone just took it at face value and seemed to really like it and laughed and were intrigued.\n\nOur thing in the edit room was like, well, if I\u2019m watching a documentary \u2014 say, Making a Murderer or something like that \u2014 I don\u2019t know anything about any of these people, so you could go into this not knowing who I am or who Gregg is. But for the On Cinema fan, you\u2019re gonna be rewarded in knowing about the backstory of these people, and that\u2019ll be exciting, you know? Hopefully, it\u2019ll be satisfying.\n\nIt\u2019s still going to be a niche comedy because of the kind of comedy it is anyway. It\u2019s not a feel-good movie. It\u2019s not a movie where, you know, there\u2019s sympathetic characters.\n\nAnd there are a lot of George Burns references.\n\n[Laughs.] Yeah, yeah. So, it\u2019s still going to be kind of a marginalized thing, and that\u2019s been the problem with my career for a long time.\n\nIn the movie, when you are meeting people on the street while in character, no matter how dickish, rude, and ignorant you are, everybody treats you pretty passively. Were you expecting that?\n\nNo, we didn\u2019t know what to expect. I think one thing that helped us was that the stakes are fairly low for this character, in the sense that it\u2019s a guy going around saying that he\u2019s running for district attorney. I think most people, if somebody comes up, they\u2019re kind of already disinterested a little bit. You\u2019re already distracted and not really super-invested in whether I am [running] or not. We were pretty surprised that we went in with these signs that said, \u201cWe have a rat problem,\u201d and a remarkable number of places were like, \u201cSure, put up whatever you want.\u201d\n\n[Laughs.]\n\nI think partly that\u2019s to do with going into San Bernardino. If you did it in a bigger city, people are a little more cynical, or a little more standoffish. People were pretty open and interested to talk to me and were generally pretty nice about it, or just sort of not interested. Of course, we didn\u2019t use everything we shot. There were things that didn\u2019t work out, and there were people that weren\u2019t cooperative or interested in talking.\n\nHas playing this character for years taught you anything about Trump supporters and the MAGA Twitter guy mind-set that you didn\u2019t know before, especially now that you\u2019re interacting with other people in character?\n\nI think that you can bloviate and say a lot of terrible things, and generally [because of] people\u2019s innate sense of politeness or attempts to avoid conflict, you can get away with a lot of shitty things. People don\u2019t really challenge you in the moment. Trump and his supporters just get away with saying awful, terrible things, and a lot of times it\u2019s coded or it\u2019s dog-whistle-y and stuff, and you know the innate nature of people is to not challenge that in real time. And I certainly noticed that a lot.\n\nI had this experience with a neighbor who was moving out, and he was, I would imagine, a Trump supporter. This kind of Staten Island\u2013type guy that was always cracking jokes. I said, \u201cDo you know who\u2019s moving in?\u201d We\u2019re just standing on the street, and he says, \u201cOh, I think about ten black guys are moving in,\u201d as, like, a joke, you know? And I just froze and just kind of turned and walked away, being like, Fuck this guy, but what am I gonna do? I\u2019m not gonna start, like, screaming in his face, you know? So I think there\u2019s a lot of that stuff that people get away with, and my character can certainly say a lot of outrageous things, and it doesn\u2019t turn into a screaming match, and it doesn\u2019t turn into a physical confrontation.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned on Twitter and in past interviews that you always try to engage with your right-leaning fans in an attempt to sway them away from the alt-right. Do you think about those fans as you\u2019re writing for your character? Do you see your character as a sort of cautionary tale for them?\n\nWell, not actively, not consciously. I don\u2019t think about them in that way. On Office Hours, the podcast and call-in show I do, and in person, I would be open to debate or discussion. Or let them know that there\u2019s a way to be that doesn\u2019t necessarily involve so much racism and homophobia and xenophobia and stuff. But I think our goal with my character, in terms of the political perspective, is not to be too sympathetic to those people and treat them as damaged, tragic characters.\n\nWhile Trump is an obvious touchstone for your character and for the campaign in the movie, are there any other people that served as influences?\n\nGod, there\u2019s so many. I can\u2019t remember a specific one that we referenced closely, but even things like \u2014 going back a few years \u2014 the Herman Cain campaign, which I, of course, made a record about. The commercial his campaign manager did where he was smoking. That was something we always passed around. We love that kind of poorly made [ad].\n\nAlso, that very stark, tough-guy messaging that isn\u2019t reflective of how complicated the world actually is. You know, when people talk in such black-and-white, stark terms about how to fix problems. In the movie, when I say, \u201cIf you commit a crime, you go to jail for life,\u201d there are people out there that buy into that, where \u2026 if we did this, this, and this, we\u2019d have this utopian society. That\u2019s so pervasive everywhere, I think.\n\nRecently, the New York Times referred to you as an \u201canti-humorist\u201d in a synopsis of Mister America, which is something you bristled at on Twitter. Can you go a little more into your frustrations with being saddled with the anti-comedy label?\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a petty thing to worry about, and I think it\u2019s generally used as a compliment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant as a derogatory term. I just think it\u2019s a little frustrating, because we always perceive what we\u2019re doing as comedy, or as a way to make an audience entertained and laugh. We use a different set of tools, you know?\n\nBut ultimately, I feel a connection from Mister America to Spinal Tap in a very real way. It\u2019s playing things a little drier and also sort of focusing on the comedy of failure. I keep thinking of the scene in Spinal Tap where they\u2019re playing at the puppet show at the amusement park, and there\u2019s like ten people in the audience, and the guy\u2019s giving the thumbs down, and they\u2019re playing their \u201cjazz odyssey.\u201d And I see a total direct line between that and my town hall appearance in the movie. It\u2019s the same shit, you know? And I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever call Christopher Guest or any of those guys \u201canti-humor\u201d or \u201canti-comedy.\u201d It\u2019s just a different way of doing it.\n\nOf course, I understand there\u2019s a kind of comedy that involves presenting things that are intentionally unfunny, and that becomes the irony or the joke. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this is at all. So, whatever. The New York Times is gonna use shortcuts to describe things for their audience that they might not understand. But our director Eric said, \u201cCould have been worse. They could have called you a \u2018humorist,\u2019 which is worse than being an anti-humorist.\u201d [Laughs.]", "description": "An interview with comedian Tim Heidecker about his new movie \u2018Mister America\u2019 and his thoughts on being labeled as an \u201canti-humorist.\u201d", "authors": ["Chris Kopcow"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-mister-america.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
