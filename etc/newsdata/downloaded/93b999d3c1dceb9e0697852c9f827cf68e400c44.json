Cue a flurry of speculation. It now looks like Uber is taking baby-steps towards building such a raft of products out, potentially by offering loans directly to drivers, according to a report from Recode/Vox.\n\nThe story is based on the emergence of an in-app survey which was sent to some drivers talking about a \u201cnew financial product\u201d aimed at drivers \u201cin a time of need.\u201d The survey then went on to question drivers\u2019 use of financing loans of $1,000 or less in the last three years. It asked \u201cwhat amount are you most likely to request?\u201d It then gave them options top pick from \u201cLess than $100,\u201d \u201cBetween $100 and $250,\u201d \u201cBetween $250 and $500\u201d and \u201cMore than $500.\u201d\n\nAt this time there\u2019s no indication of timing on a small loans product offering to drivers, and Uber has not publicly commented on the emergence of the survey\u2019s existence.\n\nHowever, Uber already has form in this space. It has offered cash advance programs to drivers in California and Michigan, although the company was criticised for what some called \u201cpay-day loans\u201d. It\u2019s also offered leases on new cars to drivers in the past and currently offers a co-branded credit card with Visa and an Uber Cash digital wallet for riders.\n\nUber would not be alone in rolling out small cash loans to its workers, given given that large companies such as Walmart and others already offer lucrative payroll advances and loans to employees.\n\nBut the fact that it now has a very large FinTech team suggests this won\u2019t the end of us hearing about Uber\u2019s tentative moves into this space.", "description": "Back in June Uber went on a hiring spree in New York, hiring at least 100 fintech-oriented tech workers to ostensibly look at creating products to increase loyalty and engagement among users and drivers, including things like banking.
