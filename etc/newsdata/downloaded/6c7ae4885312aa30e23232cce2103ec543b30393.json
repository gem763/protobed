Dan Cole is Goliath.\n\nThat\u2019s one battle that encapsulates the United States. vs. England game at the Rugby World Cup: 19-year-old American prop Ainu\u2019u, with eight test caps and even less top-level club games, vs. the grizzled, vastly experienced Cole, who has played international rugby for nearly a decade and has 90 test appearances for England.\n\n\u201cDavid is a real, real shining light for us as a team, and for the USA,\u201d U.S. head coach Gary Gold said on Wednesday on the eve of the U.S.\u2019 first game at this World Cup. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic kid, he\u2019s a wonderful rugby player, an incredibly hard worker and I\u2019m very excited to see him come up against a hugely experienced Dan Cole tomorrow.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, David has improved.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s hoping the same goes for the entire U.S. team against rugby giant England.\n\nNo one expects the U.S. to win in Kobe. The U.S. is 13 in the rankings, England No. 3. The U.S. has never progressed past the pool stage at a Rugby World Cup, England won the title in 2003. Gold guesses England\u2019s team on Thursday at Kobe Misaki Stadium has twice as many test caps as the Americans - and it\u2019s not even England\u2019s strongest lineup. The U.S. conceded 50 points against Ireland in its last game against a Tier One team. England put 50 points on the Irish in warming up for the World Cup.\n\nThe stats go on.\n\n\u201cWe do come into this game as quite severe underdogs against a very well-equipped England team,\u201d Gold said. \u201cWhat it does from our point of view is it allows us an opportunity to hopefully show that we have improved, that we can go toe to toe, even if it\u2019s just for large periods of time in the game, with a team like England.\u201d\n\nObviously, the history of Tier One vs. Tier Two teams at the World Cup is one-sided. But it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nGold was in a unique position to appreciate Japan\u2019s stunning upset of South Africa, a two-time World Cup winner, in a game turned into a move called the \u201cMiracle of Brighton,\u201d at the last World Cup in England four years ago.\n\nAppreciate? Maybe not the right word considering Gold is South African.\n\nBut he was working in Japan that year, in this city, for the Kobe Steelers rugby team. Gold said that outrageous upset has \u201cchanged the mindset\u201d of the heavily favored teams against the minnows at Rugby World Cups.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we\u2019ve all been there,\u201d he said, \u201cno matter what level you\u2019ve played at, or coached, and you know when you are playing a team that is on paper supposed to be weaker than you.\n\n\u201cThe England players, it\u2019ll go through their mind. Maybe not very long, but it\u2019ll go through their mind. What if? What if? What if?\u201d\n\nTo complete the connection to Brighton, Eddie Jones, who coached the Japanese then, leads England in Japan in 2019. The English denied they spent any time thinking about Japan 34, South Africa 32, in September 2015.\n\nEngland opened its World Cup on Sunday by beating Tonga 35-3 in a decent but not overly impressive performance.\n\n\u201cWhat happened (with) Japan-South Africa holds no relevance to us,\u201d England scrum coach Neal Hatley said. \u201cThis is about us, the next step, game two of our World Cup pool. We haven\u2019t looked at anything other than America and preparing for them.\u201d\n\nWhere there was consensus was over Ainu\u2019u.\n\nBorn in American Samoa and raised in Olympia, Washington state, the kid\u2019s good. In a sign of his great potential, he\u2019s now with top French club Toulouse. Gold said Ainu\u2019u could \u201ccomfortably play 100 tests for America one day.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s probably short-changing him to call him the David in this showdown. At 125 kilograms, the teenager outweighs Cole by a couple of kilos.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get the respect that he deserves as a starting international loosehead,\u201d Hatley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great baptism of fire for him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "David Ainu'u is, um, David.
