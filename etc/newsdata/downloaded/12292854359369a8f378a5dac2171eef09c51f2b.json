We went outside and saw Shane\u2019s car parked in the driveway, the driver\u2019s door was open and his body was lying on the floor [outside the car]. We didn\u2019t see anything else, it was dark,\u201d said the neighbour.\n\nHis son declined to speak to Weekend Witness on Friday.\n\nSeveral police officers who cannot be named said the shooting appeared to be a hit and may be gang-related.\n\nOne said Patchay was known as a drug dealer among police but that there was never enough evidence to arrest him. \u201cIt was definitely a hit and there will be more coming. He was a kingpin in the drug world and he had a lot of enemies.\u201d\n\nHe said lots of officers expected the hit could be coming.\n\nAnother police officer said that Patchay was a drug kingpin in Pietermaritzburg. \u201cWhen Patchay was with the Cash Money Brothers, he was the most ruthless of them all. He was still big in the drug world at the time of his death but he always operated very carefully so he was never caught. He had a lot of runners coming and doing the work for him. Patchay was the man who dealt out punishment to those he thought needed it.\u201d\n\nKwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder has been opened at the Mountain Rise police station. \u201cNo arrests have been made and the matter is still under investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nSketchy history with the law\n\nALTHOUGH Patchay was well-known in the Eastwood community for his generosity towards others in need and his social soccer club, he also had a sketchy history with the law.\n\nAn article published by The Witness in 2010 stated that Patchay was employed as a peace officer for Msunduzi Municipality\u2019s planning section and did not disclose his criminal record to the municipality when applying for the job. Patchay\u2019s criminal career started in the early 1990s when he was found guilty of theft in 1990. Patchay was also a member of the Cash Money Brothers as well as the bodyguard of the infamous slain warlord, Sifiso Nkabinde.\n\nNkabinde held Richmond in an iron grip of terror until he was killed in January 1999.\n\nPatchay was charged with the murder of five ANC members, including two councillors, in July 1997. The order for the murders allegedly came from Nkabinde, who was expelled by the ANC. Patchay was acquitted of the charges in May 1998. However, by July 1998 he was again in court with two alleged members of the Cash Money Brothers on charges of murder, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition for the alleged killing of Eastwood resident Andrew Joseph in 1996.\n\nThe hearing started while Patchay was in jail awaiting trial in connection with the Richmond killings. He was acquitted.\n\nIn 2003 he was charged with the attempted murder of Garth Donnelly. The charges were later withdrawn. By 2005 he was charged with the murder of Kevin Johnson who was gunned down in Tarantaal Road near to where Patchay lived, but charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. He told the courts at the time that he was unemployed, but had acquired a minibus which he used to transport children to school.\n\n\u2018He was an open book\u2019\n\nA heartbroken friend who asked not to be named told Weekend Witness, \u201cI heard about Shane long before I had met him.\n\n\u201cI heard all the wild stories, I imagined him to be this wild gangster who just lost his head and turned over tables, I imagined gold chains and sketchy women hanging off him, but I\u2019ll never forget the day I actually met him, the most humble, soft-spoken man, towering over the world but still down to earth and so easy to speak to.\n\n\u201cHe was an open book, we spoke for hours, he was so comfortable to be around and just felt like he was family.\n\n\u201cAnd Shane was so respected, everywhere he went people would come greet him, it wasn\u2019t the kind of respect that fear brought, but the kind of respect you get when you are good to people, he wasn\u2019t just a friend to his friends, he was a brother. When someone had a problem, they go to Shane to help sort it out ... He protected the people he cared about, and always had an ear to listen to what someone was going through,\u201d said the friend.\n\nTributes pour in for Patchay\n\nSoccial media posts mourning the death of Patchay were plastered all over his Facebook wall on Friday.\n\nFriends and family took to the page to pay their respects and share special memories of Patchay.\n\nKyle Devon Cole posted on Patchay\u2019s Facebook timeline: \u201cRest in peace, my brother, my friend, CMB (Cash Money Brothers) for life. Rest in power\u201d.\n\nTenille Gilbert\u200e posted: \u201cAfter hearing these horrible news last night [Thursday night], I decided to go to bed. When I woke up, I hoped it was all a dream and then I come on Facebook only to realise it\u2019s not. I always thought you were one of those people who would outlive everyone. You\u2019re going to be missed by a lot of people. Rest in peace Patchay. You\u2019re with the other original members now.\u201d\n\nCameron Greaves posted: \u201cI just saw you last night at the soccer grounds making jokes and telling me how you are coming to watch Young Lions play rugby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll cherish all the jokes and times we had together. Rest well Rods.\u201d\n\nGenevieve Van Der Westhuizen posted: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve processed it all just yet. One of the happiest feelings is walking into Saki and seeing you, towering above everyone else ...\n\nIt\u2019s been an honour to have you call me your sister.\u201d", "description": "Described as the \u201ckingpin of Pietermaritzburg\u2019s dark underworld of drugs\u201d by several police officers, former Eastwood Cash Money Brothers gangster Shane Patchay was shot execution-style outside his home on Thursday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7079/d640500861ed471baa538319150798ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-31"}
