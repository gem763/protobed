It was a hard fought negotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe achieved the outcome that President Trump sent us to achieve.\u201d\n\nThere has been bipartisan opposition to the withdrawal of American military troops from those who say the U.S. is abandoning the Kurds, a stalwart ally in the struggle against ISIS. But Mr. Pompeo said he was confident the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to \u201ccrush\u201d ISIS will continue.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make sure that we take the primary effort, which is to make sure we keep the American people safe from the threats from radical Islamic terrorism wherever we find it,\u201d he told Mr. Stephanopoulus.\n\nPresident Trump believes the U.S. has accomplished a \u201csignificant\u201d part of the mission in the area and wants the American forces to \u201ccome home,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. But, they are not coming home anytime soon. The U.S. military personnel who are withdrawing from Syria will be assigned to western Iraq to continue a counter-ISIS mission and to help Iraq, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters on his trip to the region.\n\nMr. Pompeo said the Trump administration is serious about countering Iran\u2019s influence in Syria and took a jab at the Obama administration\u2019s efforts on the subject.\n\n\u201cThe efforts to push back against Iran are real and continuous, unlike what the last administration did that picked Iran as its strategic security partner in the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nWork still continues to ensure stability along the Turkish-Syrian border, but Mr. Pompeo said he remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cAnd now we make sure that the commitments that were made in that (cease-fire) statement are honored,\u201d he told Mr. Stephanopoulos.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
