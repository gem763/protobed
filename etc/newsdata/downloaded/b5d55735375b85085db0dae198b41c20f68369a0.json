But more intriguing than the fact that SoftBank \u2014 a company that\u2019s already dumped a ton of investment into WeWork \u2014 has stepped in to save WeWork\u2019s arse is a report by the Journal that Neumann is set to make away with $US1.7 billion ($2.5 billion) in the deal.\n\nThe decision was previously rumoured to be imminent in earlier reports from both Bloomberg and CNBC this week.\n\nCiting sources familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that SoftBank will additionally offer Neumann somewhere in the ballpark of $US500 million ($730 million) in credit to pay off a previous line of personal credit from JPMorgan Chase (one of a number the bank extended to the ousted former CEO). The Journal said that Neumann will further get a $US185 million ($270 million) consulting fee.\n\nSoftBank is expected to buy about $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) in stock from Neumann, the Journal said, and the co-founder \u2014 who stepped down from his role as chief executive officer in September \u2014 is said to be exiting his role as chairman of We Company. As previous reports noted, the deal will further sideline the man who helped build WeWork\u2019s empire as the company works to right the ship after the company\u2019s failed initial public offering.\n\nNeither Softbank nor WeWork immediately returned requests for comment about the reports.\n\nMany of WeWork\u2019s troubles have been playing out on the public stage for months now. Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork detailing the company\u2019s financials ahead of its IPO revealed it was haemorrhaging millions of dollars year after year.\n\nMultiple profiles of Neumann gave the impression that he grossly mismanaged his company and engaged in bizarre and unprofessional behaviour in work environments. Then there was the disastrous IPO, which was delayed due to concerns over the company\u2019s leadership and financial standing.\n\nOn top of all of that, a report found that WeWork\u2019s Wi-Fi was appallingly under-protected and exposed an \u201castronomical amount\u201d of data. There was the report that its phone booths may have a potentially toxic amount of formaldehyde, with the company removing roughly 700 from service at its sites while it conducted \u201ctesting.\u201d\n\nThere was news of the closure of the company\u2019s Manhattan private school WeGrow, and a report this week that the company was delaying the layoff of thousands of employees because it couldn\u2019t afford severance.\n\nAll of this, and Neumann \u2014 who oversaw this operation until last month \u2014 is still walking away from the fire he lit under this business with more nearly $US1.7 billion ($2 billion). A truly spectacular grift from the same man who tried to convince us that his real estate venture was tech innovation.
