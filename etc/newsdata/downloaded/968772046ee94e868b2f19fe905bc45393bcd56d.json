(Ray Howard/AP)\n\nJohn Keenan, the police official who led New York City\u2019s manhunt for the \u201cSon of Sam\u201d killer and eventually took a case-solving confession from David Berkowitz, died Sept. 19. He was 99.\n\nHis death was announced by the New York Police Department. No further details were provided.\n\nMr. Keenan was the NYPD\u2019s chief of detectives during the killing rampage, which terrified the city in 1976 and 1977 as an unknown gunman stalked his victims with a .44 caliber handgun, killing six and wounding seven others.\n\nWhen a parking ticket, issued to a car seen parked near the scene of one slaying, finally led detectives on Aug. 10, 1977, to the Yonkers home of Berkowitz, a 24-year-old postal worker, Mr. Keenan was there to confront him. It was a climactic scene Keenan later recounted many times for journalists.\n\n\u201cI know you. You\u2019re detective \u2014 Chief Keenan,\u201d said Berkowitz, who had publicly taunted the police with notes during the hunt.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Mr. Keenan asked.\n\n\u201cI am the Son of Sam,\u201d Berkowitz replied.\n\nMr. Keenan\u2019s work on the case came near the end of a 37-year career with the police department. He announced his retirement five months later when a new commissioner took office and wanted to appoint his own top deputies.\n\nDuring World War II, Mr. Keenan was a lieutenant in the Army\u2019s Counter Intelligence Corps. He landed on Utah Beach in the D-Day invasion and participated in the Battle of the Bulge and the liberation of Paris. Author J.D. Salinger, who was writing \u201cCatcher in the Rye\u201d between battles, was in Mr. Keenan\u2019s infantry division and became a lifelong friend.\n\nAfter leaving the NYPD, Mr. Keenan became vice president of operations at the New York Racing Association, which operates the Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga thoroughbred horse tracks.\n\nHe lived in Rockville Centre on Long Island. He and his wife, Sara, were married for 73 years. Two of their three daughters preceded him in death.\n\nMr. Keenan\u2019s leadership of the Son of Sam manhunt cemented his reputation as a tough but tactical police officer.\n\nSearching for the killer, he oversaw a task force dubbed Operation Omega that by one count involved 75 detectives and more than 200 uniformed officers. He also used televised news conferences to talk directly to the killer, trying to coax him into stopping his crime rampage and surrender.\n\n\u201cSon of Sam, we now know you are not a woman hater \u2014 and know how you have suffered,\u201d Mr. Keenan said at a news conference after the killer identified himself by that nickname in a note left at the scene of a double homicide in April 1977. \u201cWe wish to help you, and it is not too late. Please let us help you.\u201d\n\nRecounting the manhunt to TV news station NY1 for the 40th anniversary of the arrest, Mr. Keenan said even he had been afraid of where the gunman might strike next.\n\n\u201cMy daughter Joan was a teenager, and I had two other daughters,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cAnd I was worried about them. I realized most fathers were in the same position: They were worried about their daughters. It became kind of a panic in the city.\u201d\n\nThe killer had been taunting investigators in letters to New York Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin. In one, he offered detectives words of encouragement.\n\n\u201cPlease inform all the detectives working the case that I wish them the best of luck,\u201d Berkowitz wrote. \u201cKeep Em digging, drive on, think positive, get off your butts, knock on coffins, etc.\n\n\u201cUpon my capture I promise to buy all the guys working on the case a new pair of shoes if I can get up the money.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Associated Press", "description": "A parking ticket led to the arrest of serial killer David Berkowitz in 1977.", "authors": ["Michael R.
