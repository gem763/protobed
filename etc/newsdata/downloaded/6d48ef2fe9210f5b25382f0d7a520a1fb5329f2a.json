Today I\u2019m off to Myrtle Avenue, ground zero for international aviation enthusiasts. I\u2019ve always been interested in planes \u2013 although I\u2019m usually much more likely to take one than just watch one \u2013 but have never taken the leap to full-on plane spotter without... going anywhere.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis typical suburban residential street, all 1930s-style semis with neat driveways, doesn\u2019t look out of the ordinary. It\u2019s full of estate cars, and on this blue-sky day, residents are out on the driveways fixing their bikes, washing their vehicles, gardening. But poor Myrtle Avenue is the image you\u2019ll often see next to headlines like, \u201cIs this Britain\u2019s noisiest street?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This grassy area is about as close as you can get to Heathrow airport without buying a ticket and its been the best plane-spotting location ever since the official Heathrow viewing area closed.\n\nIndeed, from this nondescript patch of grass, occasionally dotted with a suburban tree, there\u2019s an almost unrivalled view of the planes landing into Europe\u2019s busiest airport about 200 metres away. Perhaps the newspaper headlines had a point: it\u2019s pretty noisy.\n\nArmed with a picnic blanket, sandwiches and a fully-charged phone to check FlightRadar24 (which gives a live feed showing what\u2019s flying overhead \u2013 an essential app for every plane spotter), we sat down on the grass and waited.\n\nBut not for long. Every 90 seconds a plane appears behind Myrtle Avenue\u2019s houses to land at Heathrow (with the same frequency for take-offs), the equivalent to a dizzying 1,400 landings and take-offs every day \u2013 or almost half a million a year. And if the controversial Heathrow expansion goes ahead, that number will increase by 59 per cent to 756,000.\n\nFellow plane spotters at Myrtle Avenue (Cathy Adams)\n\nMyrtle Avenue is only a good place to plane spot when aircraft land onto Heathrow\u2019s south runway. We\u2019d checked the landing schedule earlier \u2013 planes typically arrive on the south runway and take off from the north until 3pm, then they switch (to give Myrtle Avenue\u2019s ears some respite, I imagine). This can change for maintenance or bad weather.\n\nAnd gosh, watching the planes come into land was deafeningly thrilling.\n\nI estimated around seven out of every eight planes were British Airways. We almost got the full fleet: narrow-body Airbus A321s and A320s from Europe, all the way to long-range Boeing 777s from America and Asia. I even spied one of its A380s, the biggest commercial passenger plane in the world, but not a single of its ageing Boeing 747s. Shame.\n\nThe Gulf superjumbos were the most thrilling (Cathy Adams)\n\nWhat we were all waiting for were the jumbos. The A380s from the Gulf carriers Etihad, Qatar and Emirates got the most plane spotters reaching for their phones (and in some cases, long-range cameras). Their gargantuan size \u2013 they can carry up to 853 passengers each \u2013 meant a roar as they came into land and a chance to look closely at the underside of each. (Did you know Abu Dhabi-based Etihad paints the underside of its planes gold?)\n\nPlanes appear from over the houses (Cathy Adams)\n\nGiven the majority of planes landing were in British Airways colours, I was on the lookout for other carriers. I spied a black and white Air New Zealand Boeing 777 from Los Angeles (it flies from Auckland to London via LAX); an MEA jet from Beirut with the Lebanese emblem of a green tree emblazoned on the side; and a colourful TAP jet from Portugal. We even spotted a tiny De Havilland Dash 8-400 turboprop plane, belonging to domestic airline Flybe \u2013 which after the Emirates A380 looked like a Russian doll version of an aircraft.\n\nWalking back to the station from Myrtle Avenue, I found an even more thunderous spot. About midway along Hatton Road, the planes belt past almost overhead. The moment one passes, look into the distance and you\u2019ll see at least three aircraft stacked up neatly, lights blinking. Watching this air traffic control puzzle is every bit as exhilarating as seeing them actually come into land. Perhaps I am a plane spotter after all...\n\nTop tips for plane spotting on Myrtle Avenue", "description": "There isn\u2019t much to see if you come out of Hatton Cross Tube station onto the Great South West Road, but there is plenty to hear.
