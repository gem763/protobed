I wanted to marry this girl and spend the rest of my life with her but I can\u2019t now.\n\n\"That night has changed my life forever. I saw my girlfriend killed. I ran over to her and held her. I wrapped her in my hoody, I knew she was gone when I saw her eyes.\n\n\"One of her eyes looked like a sunflower and that sunflower was gone.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nHe described being driven to Arrowe Park Hospital by a bouncer who had witnessed the crash.\n\nHe said: \"I sat with Charl for a long time, just looking at her, trying to work out what was happening, willing her to just wake up and tell me she loved me one last time.\n\n\"She looked just as beautiful as the first day I met her at school. She had always told everyone that she would be with me and she did. She will always have my heart....\n\n\"She made me feel like I could do anything and be anything, she was the most loyal, beautiful, caring person in the world who made me the happiest person ever.\n\n\"I am nothing without her, I feel nothing without her. The second she died I died with her.\"\n\nMr Hopkins also read a statement from Charlotte's mum, Helen Martin, who described the hospital room as \"filled with deepest sorrow\".\n\nShe said: \"In one moment my family as I knew and cherished it was obliterated, my beautiful daughter, my best friend, gone.\n\n\"I long for her to come home to see her smile, to sit and chat about everything as we did. I miss her singing and dancing around, I miss what is her.\"\n\nA statement from Kate, who said she had known Charlotte since the age of 8, said she was the \"happiest, bubbliest person you could meet.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nShe said: \"No one at the age of 19 ever expects to go out with their best friend and for one of them not to return home the same night.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a very hard struggle. I try to just stay as busy as possible and not think about it.\n\n\"It just doesn\u2019t seem to get easier without her. I can be walking home from work or even just lying in bed and the night just replays in my head over and over, asking what ifs constantly.\"\n\nMr Hopkins told the court White had been seen by several witnesses driving at high speeds on Conway Street.\n\nHe said: \"Rhys West confirms that he was a short distance behind the girls at the crossing. He was concentrating on checking for traffic to his right when he heard an almighty bang and immediately focused his attention towards where the girls were crossing.\n\n\"He estimates that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was travelling at motorway speeds, around 70mph. As he crossed the road he saw his girlfriend four to five car lengths up Conway Street.\n\n\"He screamed her name but got no response. It was later at hospital that he was told that she had died...\n\n\"The defendant then continued to drive to the end of Conway Street. He did not stop. With his windscreen smashed and intruding into his car, damage to the bonnet and light cluster and a headlight out, he turned left at the roundabout onto Argyle Street.\"\n\nMr Hopkins said the CCTV footage revealed the driver's speed at the time of the collision was 69.9mph, despite his claims that he had been travelling at \"30ish\" miles an hour and the girls had stepped out in front of him.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nThe court also heard that White had been caught speeding a few months before the incident, hitting 62mph on a 40mph road.\n\nMartine Snowdon, defending, told the court her client had been \"stressed\" after hearing his teenage daughter, who had arranged a sleep over with a friend, was not at her friend's house.\n\nShe said: \"As a father of two teenagers and with a teenage daughter of his own the effects of the horrific tragedy are particularly poignant for this defendant.\n\n\"He knows only too well that no matter how desperately he regrets what he did, and no matter how much he wishes he could turn back the clock, he can't.\"\n\nJudge Brandon told White: \"In her short life (Charlotte) made her family proud and would have continued to do so. She had everything to live for.\n\n\"The decency of her family and friends after the collision is in stark contrast to the cowardly actions of this defendant. Rather than stop to help you drove off and stopped in Dacre Street.\n\n\"I am entirely satisfied that if you had been paying proper attention and driving within the speed limit you would have seen them and had time to slow down or avoid the fatal collision.\"\n\nJudge Brandon also banned White from driving for six years and three months.", "description": "Charlotte Carroll, 19, died after Carl White smashed into her at a pedestrian crossing in Birkenhead on May 19 last year", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580128.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Charlotte-Carroll.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
