(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMove over \u201cKylie Jenner Challenge.\u201d The internet has its next viral, fuller lips challenge \u2014 and it\u2019s a sticky situation.\n\nThe latest challenge involves young girls applying eyelash adhesive or nail glue right above their upper lips to pin them back and make them look fuller.\n\nWhile some outlets are saying this all started with TikTok user @chloehammock4\u2019s Sept. 7 video, others on social media have commented that @gnarlysinner, who posted a similar TikTok video on Sept. 6, was the first to do this. Regardless, @chloehammock4\u2019s video in particular took off, garnering more than 400,000 likes and over 3,000 comments. In the video, she\u2019s seen swiping some sort of glue across her upper lip, letting it air dry for a bit, and then pressing her upper lip so it stays up, creating the illusion of fuller, Kylie Jenner-esque lips.\n\nThe video has created a domino-like effect, with several others following suit on TikTok and Twitter.\n\nBut Susan Massick, dermatologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that \u2014 no surprise \u2014 using glue on your face, particularly the lip area, is not a good idea.\n\nTikTok user @chloehammock4's video, where she applies eyelash adhesive or nail glue above her upper lip to get it stay up and look fuller, went viral. (Photo: TikTok) More\n\n\u201cMany adhesives, particularly nail glues, contain the chemical cyanoacrylate, similar to what you can find in Super Glue,\u201d Massick tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThere is no reason to be applying these adhesives on to your face, let alone on the lip.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cThese chemicals can cause itching, redness, and irritation to your skin and some patients who are allergic can develop blistering.\u201d\n\nSo what can people do to get healthy, fuller-looking lips?\n\nMassick recommends maintaining lips by moisturizing them with emollients such as Aquaphor, Vaseline, or Vaniply and trying to avoid licking your lips, which is dehydrating. Since lips are particularly vulnerable to the sun damage, protect them by using lip balm during the day with SPF 15 or higher.\n\n\u201cWith makeup, you can exaggerate your lip line with lip liner and fill in with the same-colored lipstick or lip gloss to give a fuller-appearing lip,\u201d Massick suggests.\n\nWhile lip injections certainly aren\u2019t necessary or right for everyone, it\u2019s also an option for some. \u201cIf you are still wanting a fuller pout, then you can consider having lip filler injections performed by a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon for improved lip enhancement and augmentation,\u201d she says.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Move over \u201cKylie Jenner Challenge.\u201d The internet has its next viral, fuller lips challenge \u2014 and it\u2019s a sticky situation.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/76rIfAz3d9d9rGKzuSfEGA--~B/aD0yMzAyO3c9NDI4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bde972e0-d594-11e9-af8b-8f69821655eb"}
