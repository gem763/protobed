Last year coal\u2019s share had shrunk to just 5 per cent. And between April and June this year it fell to an all-time low of just 0.6 per cent.\n\nThis accelerated decline is explained partly by the government\u2019s decision to slap an expiry date on the industry, announcing in 2015 that it would stamp out coal power entirely within a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, Britain clocked up its first fortnight without coal power since 1882. And since 2008, the UK has cut the carbon content of its electricity generation at the fastest rate of 25 major economies, ahead of Denmark, the US and China, according to Imperial College London and energy consultancy E4tech.\n\nIts transformation from coal powerhouse \u2014 as recently as 1960, coal mining employed more than 600,000 people \u2014 to almost coal power-free is hugely significant at a time when countries are grappling with how to meet the 2015 Paris climate deal to limit global warming to well below 2C. To achieve this, global emissions of carbon dioxide should already be declining by 3 per cent a year \u2014 but instead they are still rising, reaching a record high in 2018.\n\nThe EU is pushing for a bloc-wide target to cut net CO2 emissions to zero by 2050 \u2014 a target the UK committed to law this summer. Yet some member states are still heavily reliant on the fuel. Poland, for example, still draws 80 per cent of its electricity from coal-fired plants. And in Germany, the biggest coal consumer and biggest power producer in the EU, coal accounted for just over a third of power generation last year.\n\nSince Britain\u2019s first centralised natural gas plant was commissioned in 1991 the fuel, which is less polluting than coal, has become the biggest single contributor to power generation in the UK \u2014 accounting for almost 40 per cent in 2018. Financial Times\n\n\u201cThe British experience shows that any country can actually do it [end coal power]; it\u2019s a question of putting the policies in place to do it,\u201d says Richard Black, director of the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK environmental think-tank. \u201cHad Germany decided to tackle coal first rather than nuclear [which it has committed to phasing out by 2022], I think Germany could be in a similar position to the UK.\u201d\n\nLess than an hour\u2019s drive from Aberthaw, near the village of Felindre in South Wales, is a remote location hedged by green fields and trees that offers a clue to why coal is no longer the dominant fuel in Britain\u2019s power sector. Drax, a FTSE 250 power company, whose heritage is steeped in coal, has won consent from the government to build a natural gas plant at the rural location to help meet gaps in electricity demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Britain\u2019s first centralised natural gas plant was commissioned in 1991 the fuel, which is less polluting than coal, has become the biggest single contributor to power generation in the UK \u2014 accounting for almost 40 per cent in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe dash for gas in the 1990s is huge as far as the coal decline is concerned,\u201d says Richard Howard, research director at Oxford-based consultancy Aurora. By then, Britain had a domestic offshore oil and gas industry in the North Sea offering plentiful supplies. And coal had already been phased out from other key parts of the economy. Steam trains had been replaced by diesel. Homes, once heated by coal, were fitted with modern gas boilers.\n\nIn 1991, the EU lifted restrictions on the use of natural gas for power generation. The move proved a catalyst and came just 12 months after Britain\u2019s electricity system had been privatised, leading the newly private enterprises to build gas-fired power stations that had lower capital costs than coal.\n\nJosh Burke, policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, says a \u201cconfluence of market drivers and regulatory interventions\u201d have worked together since the turn of the decade to push coal off the system.\n\nAlthough Britain is building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point \u2014 the cost of which has risen by almost \u00a33b \u2014 all but one of the country\u2019s current reactor fleet will have to be retired by 2030. Bloomberg\n\nEuropean and domestic legislation to tackle emissions have ensured that coal plants have become increasingly uneconomic to run, or build. In the UK, no new coal plants can be constructed without expensive carbon capture and storage technology.\n\nMr Burke cites 2013 as a particularly critical turning point, when the UK became the first country in the EU to introduce a carbon price support, a tax paid by companies that generate electricity from fossil fuels, which severely weakened the investment case for coal. The tariff, priced at \u00a318 a tonne of carbon dioxide, was designed to top up Europe\u2019s emissions trading system, through which energy companies buy permits to emit carbon.\n\n\u201cThe moment the carbon price went up, coal went down dramatically,\u201d says Mr Burke. \u201cIt tipped the economics in favour of natural gas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrax\u2019s main power station covers a 2500 acre site near the North Yorkshire town of Selby. The largest power plant in the UK, it was also the biggest polluter in western Europe. Once run exclusively on coal, four of the plant\u2019s six generating units have been converted to biomass \u2014 burning wood pellets to produce energy.\n\nLast year, renewables, including biomass, produced a third of the electricity generated in the UK. By 2030, ministers want 30 gigawatts \u2014 a third of all electricity \u2014 to be sourced from offshore wind alone.\n\nOnce built, renewables such as wind and solar have low running costs. When generating, they come first in the so-called merit order \u2014 a sequence that dictates how demand for electricity is met by which source of supply. The most cost-efficient sources take priority. Coal, which has high marginal costs of production, has been pushed down the order to the point where it is rarely needed, particularly as energy demand has fallen in recent years helped by more energy efficient appliances. Low gas prices compared to coal have also played a part.\n\n\u201cIf I were a betting man\u201d, says Will Gardiner, Drax chief executive, \u201cthe likelihood that we might run [coal] past 2023 is extremely low\".\n\nCritics of UK energy policy, however, cite a recent blackout in England and Wales to argue that the electricity system has become too reliant on intermittent sources of supply such as solar and wind, which are vulnerable to changing weather conditions and rapid falls in output compared to traditional coal and gas plants that take longer to slow down and therefore act as a brake on the system.\n\nBut, says National Grid, the company in charge of matching electricity supply and demand in Britain, while the complexity of the electricity system has increased \u201cso have the tools and the resources that have become available to manage it\u201d, such as batteries that respond rapidly to help smooth out any volatility.\n\nRenewables are now second only to gas in terms of power generation in the UK. Nuclear is responsible for a further 19.5 per cent. Although Britain is building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point \u2014 the cost of which has risen by almost \u00a33 billion ($5.5 billion) \u2014 all but one of the country\u2019s current reactor fleet will have to be retired by 2030.\n\nA government white paper \u2014 which the industry and environmentalists had hoped would show how the UK planned to reduce emissions while also satisfying increased demand for electricity \u2014 was delayed shortly before Boris Johnson became prime minister in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKwasi Kwarteng, who became energy minister in July, says that the government doesn\u2019t see the country\u2019s reliance on gas as a \u201cproblem\u201d, citing its potential use in the manufacture of hydrogen, considered a cleaner fuel, although he adds: \u201cObviously we have to have clean gas.\u201d\n\nA century ago, coal mining employed 1.2 million people in Britain. Now, just a handful of producers remain \u2014 a decline that has come to be symbolised by the pit closures that triggered the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike. In 2018, UK coal production, down by 95 per cent since the 1950s, fell to just 2.6m tonnes.\n\nYet even when Britain quits coal power generation, heavy industry will still need the fossil fuel to manufacture products including steel and cement. The majority of that demand is met from imports. In the first three months of 2019, the UK imported 2.6m tonnes of coal; the biggest single source was Russia. Indigenous production was just 592,000 tonnes.\n\nUK producers, such as the County Durham-based Banks Group, argue the country\u2019s remaining demands should be met by domestic supply and are still trying to open new mines but are often faced by environmental opposition. Otherwise, they argue, the country is forgoing both economic benefit and control over environmental standards.\n\n\u201cThe UK currently needs between 5m and 6m tonnes of coal just to continue supplying a range of essential industries, including steel and cement manufacturing,\u201d says Mark Dowdall, environment and community director at The Banks Group. \u201cAround 80 per cent of the UK\u2019s need for coal is currently met through imports, increasingly from the US and particularly Russia, and the greenhouse gas emissions of importing coals from these countries is significantly higher than producing it in the UK.\u201d\n\nIn March, the UK\u2019s first deep coal mine for more than 30 years was given the go-ahead by Cumbria county council in north-west England. The \u00a3180m Woodhouse colliery, on a coastal site in West Cumbria, is scheduled to open in 2022 and will produce 2.4m tonnes of coal a year for use in both the domestic and European steel industry.\n\nIn the longer-term, heavy industrial users know they too will have to find substitutes for coal yet they warn solutions are still a way off. Research into alternatives needs time, finance and UK government support.\n\n\u201cUltimately, making steel and emitting carbon isn\u2019t acceptable; we have to bite the bullet on this,\u201d says Chris McDonald, chief executive of the Materials Processing Institute, an industrial research centre with close steel industry links. \u201cIt\u2019s no good saying we\u2019ll tax the carbon to death because then you\u2019ll just kill the industry in the UK and the carbon will still be emitted somewhere else in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUK Steel, a trade association, says that in 2018 the country made 7.3m tonnes of crude steel. Of this, 5.7m tonnes was made via the basic oxygen steel furnace process which needs coking coal to drive oxygen out of iron ore to create steel used in sectors from construction to automotive and aerospace.\n\nSteelmakers believe carbon capture usage and storage, could be an option to meet decarbonisation demands but it is far from a quick fix. Mr Kwarteng concedes that the government has \u201cdragged its feet\u201d in the area.\n\nMr Glover sees what is happening at Aberthaw as a mirror for the changes taking place across Europe as it tries to cut carbon from its economy. \u201cIt is quite a good microcosm for how the shift works,\u201d he says. He points out how challenging these changes are for employees, particularly in areas that are already economically depressed. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing in the energy transition,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of staff . . . we\u2019ve got responsibilities to the communities that we are in.\u201d\n\nBack in his Swindon office, Mr Glover has two pictures of Aberthaw on the wall. One shows him standing on top of the coal pile, while the other is a sunset shot of the power station. \u201cIt will stay on my wall when I put my wind farms up as well,\u201d he says.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Once the world\u2019s largest coal consumer, the UK is edging towards zero consumption of the fossil fuel in its energy mix.
