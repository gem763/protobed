For Ronan Farrow, whose investigation for the New Yorker won him a Pulitzer prize in 2018, the effect was paranoia-inducing. He was convinced he was being followed; he thought his phone had been hacked. At one point, he opened a safety deposit box in a vault beneath a branch of Bank of America, and placed in it transcripts of interviews with dozens of sources and a flash drive containing incriminating audio. On top of the pile, he left a note with instructions on whom to contact \u201cshould anything happen to me\u201d, and the entreaty: \u201cPlease make sure this information is released.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, the surveillance was real, and the threat of legal action constant. The pressure on everyone involved was so intense that, prior to publication of Farrow\u2019s new book, Catch And Kill, he spent so long on the phone with a New Yorker factchecker called Sean, that Sean \u201cgot a stress nosebleed\u201d.\n\nWe meet in Farrow\u2019s publisher\u2019s office in midtown Manhattan, where the 31-year-old is hastily eating between meetings. When the Weinstein story broke, Farrow was not an anonymous byline; arguably, he was as well known as the producer himself. His parents are Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and the speculation about their relationship went back decades \u2013 as did the controversy around the sexual abuse allegations made by Dylan, Farrow\u2019s older sister, against their father. During the course of the investigation, Weinstein would weaponise all of this to try to unnerve him.\n\nIf Farrow was intimidated, it isn\u2019t his style to show it: he is amused, sardonic, diminutive, in a way that invites comparisons to Truman Capote; and, unlike most reporters, highly socially at ease. He is also run ragged. During the Weinstein investigations and others that followed \u2013 primarily Farrow\u2019s reporting on Matt Lauer, the former NBC host accused of sexual harassment, about whom the book contains explosive new allegations \u2013 Farrow forgot to eat, go out except when following leads, or call his boyfriend in LA. For a while, he says, it was like being, \u201cthe homicide beat detective fixated on the one that got away\u201d.\n\nCatch And Kill is a very different book from She Said, the recent account of the Weinstein investigation written by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters with whom Farrow shares his Pulitzer prize. She Said is a sober, dispassionate, intensely moving piece of reconstructed reporting, into which the journalists\u2019 home lives do not intrude. Farrow, while as diligent in his reporting, permits himself some licence, the spare voice of his New Yorker articles giving way to something livelier and more personal. The book is darkly funny and poignant, featuring cameos by Jonathan Lovett \u2013 his long-suffering partner, and a podcaster and former presidential speechwriter \u2013 and Mia Farrow, his mother. If it veers occasionally into Tom Wolfe territory \u2013 a literary production too nakedly charmed by itself \u2013 it remains a winning account of how it feels to be at the centre of the biggest story in the world. It is also, of course, a breathtakingly dogged piece of reporting, in the face of extraordinary opposition. \u201cThe book was an opportunity, yes, to report on brand new leads \u2013 there are new revelations there,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cBut also to immerse a person in what it\u2019s like to follow the clues.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Interviewing Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who helped expose the Weinstein allegations. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nInitially, Farrow had more success than Kantor and Twohey at persuading actresses with allegations to go on the record: Mira Sorvino, Asia Argento and Rosanna Arquette all spoke to him about their experiences with Weinstein. One assumes Farrow was assisted in this by his background \u2013 he is a brilliant reporter, but he is also a creature of Hollywood and less subject, perhaps, to the natural suspicion that exists between celebrities and hacks \u2013 as well as, possibly, by his sexuality.\n\n\u201cI think it was absolutely part of the dynamic,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of us as journalists brings who we are to the table and, in the case of stories about sexual violence, you\u2019re asking people to talk about something that is so invasive and personal, and is about their bodies, and involves recounting in forensic detail these clinical things that are freighted with layers of shame and embarrassment. I think the fact I was not your classic straight guy, coming at it in a way where there was any concern about a leering element, helped in those conversations. I was able to use that to create a space where people felt comfortable.\u201d\n\nFarrow also had a history of reporting on sexual violence. Decades earlier, Dylan Farrow had accused Woody Allen of molesting her when she was seven. An investigation was dropped, but the allegations, which Allen has always denied, lingered. A year before he began investigating Weinstein, Farrow had defended his sister in print and gone on, very vocally, to support her.\n\nHis reporting on Weinstein began at NBC, the American TV network. By the time Farrow took the story to the New Yorker, he had a growing witness list, several bombshell interviews, and the smoking gun of a secretly taped conversation acquired by an Italian model called Ambra Battilana Gutierrez; in 2015, Gutierrez had worn a wire for an NYPD investigation into Weinstein and had audio of him harassing her and confessing to groping her. (The Manhattan district attorney had decided not to press charges.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest As a baby with parents Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and sister Dylan. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nFarrow believes there are two reasons why NBC first encouraged, and later, he alleges, ordered him to drop the story. (NBC denies this allegation.) The first, he says, was pressure from Weinstein who, through a combination of legal and other threats (to withhold interviews with the stars of his films, for example), manipulated members of upper management, including Farrow\u2019s boss, head of news Noah Oppenheim. Farrow quotes a conversation that he says took place between Andy Lack, the head of the network, and Weinstein, in which the movie producer said that, if he slept with people he shouldn\u2019t have, \u201cit was the 90s, Andy. We all did that.\u201d Lack replied, \u201cHarvey, say no more. We\u2019ll look into it.\u201d (Precisely how Farrow was able to reproduce this conversation remains obscure, though that seems to be a necessary measure undertaken to protect sources, and the book has been fact-checked to New Yorker standards. A note states: \u201cBecause this is a story about surveillance, third parties often witnessed or surreptitiously recorded conversations, and I was sometimes able to obtain their testimonials and records.\u201d) There is an unmistakable sense, reading Farrow\u2019s book, of powerful men \u2013 and sometimes women \u2013 looking out for each other without much need for further incentive.\n\nI went out of my way to convey that the way women are silenced doesn\u2019t always look like moustache-twirling villainy\n\nThe second reason NBC cooled on the story, Farrow believes, \u201cis just baseline casual misogyny. And misogyny is a very damning word, but actually it looks quite banal a lot of the time: it\u2019s not believing that it\u2019s an issue that matters. Before the Weinstein story broke, there were people out there in the world who had lived this and seen the machine that shuts these stories down, and understood that it was a big story waiting to happen. But there were a lot of others who, informed by a whole lot of cultural and identity factors, just didn\u2019t care, and didn\u2019t think anyone else would ever care.\u201d\n\nLack would later put out a memo disparaging Farrow\u2019s reporting about Weinstein, stating that he, \u201cnever had a victim or witness willing to be identified\u201d. This was not, Farrow writes, \u201ctrue of any point in the lifespan of the story at NBC\u201d. He resigned, and published his first piece on Weinstein in the New Yorker on 10 October 2017. Six months later, Weinstein was arrested and released on $1m bail. He is due to stand trial on multiple charges of predatory sexual assault and rape in January.\n\nYou don\u2019t, Farrow says, have to believe in vast conspiracy theories to understand why the story got stuck. When writing the book, he says, \u201cI went out of my way to try to convey that the way in which people, and particularly women, with these kinds of claims are silenced doesn\u2019t always look like moustache-twirling villainy.\u201d Instead, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s people who think of themselves as being reasonable and compassionate, and very often liberal, acquiescing and becoming examples of moral cowardice \u2013 because that\u2019s their cost\u2011benefit analysis.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn the early stages of his reporting career, it\u2019s safe to say Ronan Farrow wasn\u2019t taken particularly seriously. He was very blond, very confident, the child of celebrities, who, in spite of a law degree from Yale, a DPhil from Oxford and a period working as a junior official in Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department, still had a whiff of showbiz about him. In June 2016, when he pitched an item to Noah Oppenheim called The Dark Side of Hollywood?, Farrow was in a tricky place: his show Ronan Farrow Daily had been cancelled; he was back to hot-desking at NBC, and woefully behind on a book deadline. On top of that, he was recovering, once again, from intense media interest in his family.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Allen with Weinstein in 2008. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nPrior to a cultural shift that would come about in part thanks to Farrow\u2019s reporting, the Woody Allen abuse allegations had divided public opinion. (They resurfaced in 2016, in response to a glowing profile of Allen in the Hollywood Reporter.) A common view was that, while Allen was probably a creep, Mia was completely unglued on this subject after an ugly separation, while Farrow\u2019s support of his sister was overblown. This may well have been the case; Farrow admits that, far from having championed Dylan from the outset, for a long time he had resented her for not letting everyone in the family move on. His public support in 2016 was an effort to make amends.\n\nDylan is a constant, background presence in Catch And Kill. Farrow calls her for advice on how to talk to a reluctant witness (\u201cJust tell her to hang tough,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like ripping off a Band-Aid\u201d), and to ask her if he is doing the right thing. Better than anyone, perhaps, he understood how little tolerance people have for allegations of sexual assault; how annoyed and fatigued they get; how hard it is to make these things stick.\n\n\u201cThat is exactly the reality,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery story I do, there is some effort to suggest that I\u2019m not impartial, and in the Weinstein story, the personal background I had was used against me, time and time again.\u201d The producer wrote to Farrow\u2019s editors telling them he was an unreliable witness, motivated by revenge: Weinstein was Woody Allen\u2019s distributor. \u201cAnd far from that spurious claim that I had entrenched sympathies because of my sister\u2019s experiences, it was the opposite: I was the guy telling her to shut up.\u201d\n\nYou had been a bit of a dick.\n\n\u201cRight. I had been a bit of a dick. I think that\u2019s quite accurate. And I had to go through the journey that I think the culture has gone through, of being dragged to the conclusion that these are serious crimes that are being covered up, and that we need to talk about it more.\u201d\n\nWeinstein called Allen for advice on how to stop the story and handle his son. \u2018Allen shut down the idea,\u2019 Farrow says\n\nThe accusations of partiality were levelled at Farrow in one of many extraordinary legal threats sent by Weinstein to the New Yorker, part of a pattern of intimidation that included putting private detectives on his tail and trying to trap him with false friends and witnesses. (They worked for a private Israeli intelligence outfit called Black Cube; a whistleblower at the company would later leak the contract to Farrow.) A woman called \u201cDiana Filip\u201d, who introduced herself by email as a wealth manager organising a women\u2019s rights conference, turned out to have been hired by Weinstein\u2019s investigators \u2013 not only to gather information on Farrow, but to befriend and extract information from Rose McGowan. Farrow discovered that a journalist called Ben Wallace, who had been investigating Weinstein for New York magazine, had been approached by a woman called \u201cAnna\u201d, who claimed to have been assaulted by the producer. She turned out not only to be a private investigator, but the same private investigator who played \u201cDiana Filip\u201d. Meanwhile, two more detectives sat in a car outside Farrow\u2019s apartment.\n\nAnd the legal threats continued to pour in. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer warned that, while Farrow was \u201centitled to his private anger\u2026 no publisher should allow those personal feelings to create and pursue a baseless and defamatory story from his personal animus\u201d. He went on to suggest that Farrow had been brainwashed into finding Dylan\u2019s claim credible, and to cite, with stunning irrelevance, the fact that Farrow\u2019s uncle had been \u201csentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing two boys. We have yet to find any evidence that Ronan Farrow has publicly denounced his uncle, and he might have publicly supported him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With partner Jonathan Lovett. Photograph: WireImage\n\nFarrow smiles at the mention of the uncle. \u201cIt was almost absurdist to the point of theatre,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to make of it. But it was also quite lacerating on a personal level, because you\u2019re working so hard to do a meticulous and fair reporting job, and then suddenly all of these issues that have nothing to do with it \u2013 and that are personal and painful \u2013 are being thrown at you, like my sister\u2019s assault. It\u2019s a dirty move.\u201d\n\nFurther dirty moves followed. Astonishingly, Farrow suggests that at one point Weinstein called Woody Allen for advice, not only on how to stop the story, but on how to handle Farrow. \u201cHe wanted to know if Allen would intercede on his behalf. Allen shut down the idea,\u201d Farrow writes. (He is estranged from his father, to whom he refers by his surname.) But at the end of the call, Farrow quotes Allen saying to Weinstein, \u201cJeez, I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d\n\nMost of the threats were theatrical and ludicrous; at one stage, Weinstein said to Farrow, in a line that would have been cut from a script for being too cheesy: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t save someone you love, and now you think you can save everyone.\u201d Meanwhile, Weinstein\u2019s connections in New York and Washington DC seemed to leave Farrow no safe port of call. One of Weinstein\u2019s fixers, Jack Palladino, hired to gather potentially harmful information on Farrow, had once worked for the Clintons; Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, David Boies, had deep connections in the liberal media; as did Lisa Bloom, the former champion of women\u2019s rights who represented Weinstein in the early stages of the investigation. (Bloom has since been thoroughly disgraced following publication of a memo in which she shared her strategy for undermining McGowan: \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.\u201d) For a while, everywhere Farrow looked, he saw Weinstein.\n\n\u201cYou start to realise that if you are wealthy enough and connected enough, you can hire secret agents with false identities, and honeypots to seduce people, and engage in cyberhacking to try to track someone\u2019s location. This is a whole underbelly of what the wealthy and powerful do if they are in a corner,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd just the gap between the tools available to men like Harvey Weinstein, and those available to any one of the sources in those stories, was incredibly upsetting to witness.\u201d\n\nI tell him I recently noticed a headline in the New York Post referring to Ally Canosa, an event planner and former Weinstein employee who spoke to Farrow, alleging that Weinstein sexually assaulted her multiple times and raped her in a hotel room. \u201cWeinstein accuser sent affectionate emails after alleged sex attack,\u201d ran the headline, followed by a piece effectively trashing Canosa. Is it possible that, even while he is out on bail, Weinstein\u2019s manipulations are ongoing?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We interrogated her claims really, really hard,\u2019 Farrow says of Rose McGowan. \u2018She is very credible.\u2019 Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThey are without a doubt still ongoing,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd there are a number of subjects reported on in this book \u2013 I\u2019m trying to vague this up, so I\u2019m not talking about anyone [specific] \u2013 who are this very week planting pieces of spin about crimes that I report on, to try to get ahead of it in a way that is so demeaning and damaging to the women involved. And the fact that there is still a media infrastructure that supports that is something we should all take a hard look at.\u201d\n\nThe book\u2019s big scoop involves Farrow\u2019s former NBC colleague, the TV host Matt Lauer, who was fired from the network in 2017 for \u201cinappropriate sexual behaviour\u201d. At the time, the allegations made against him by a woman at the network were characterised by NBC as an extramarital affair gone awry; neither \u201ccriminal\u201d nor \u201can assault\u201d. According to Farrow, who names the woman as Brooke Nevils, a young production assistant, what allegedly happened meets the definition of rape. In an extraordinary scene towards the end of the book, based on the account Nevils gave Farrow, she goes to Lauer\u2019s hotel room while the pair are reporting on the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and he anally rapes her. \u201cShe said that she declined several times, replying, at one point, \u2018No, that\u2019s not my thing,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cNevils said that she was still in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested when he \u2018just did it\u2019. Lauer denies that anything non-consensual occurred, then or later, between him and Nevils.\n\nAt the heart of this episode is the question of coercion; Nevils, Canosa and most of the women in Farrow\u2019s book are undermined by the men they\u2019re accusing on the basis that they maintained contact after they were allegedly attacked. \u201cIt\u2019s this fundamental misapprehension about the nature of sexual violence,\u201d Farrow says, \u201cthat it plays out in a context where you would never have any contact again. Very often it plays out because people are vulnerable to those they work with, those in their families, those they can\u2019t avoid seeing again.\u201d Meanwhile, the idea that women who report sexual harassment have something to gain by it \u2013 that losing their jobs, reputations and more often than not their self-esteem is just grist for shaking down wealthy men \u2013 continues to prosper.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With his mother last year. Photograph: AP\n\nOne comes back to the fact that it\u2019s not the crime, it\u2019s the cover-up; that the most shocking aspect of the stories broken by Farrow and his colleagues is not the alleged assaults, but the systems that allow and perpetuate them. Patient zero in both the New York Times and Farrow\u2019s reporting was McGowan, the actor who had for years been making allegations that Weinstein had raped her at the Sundance film festival in 1997. Weinstein\u2019s spin machine went after her hard, briefing against her to journalists, characterising her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and an unreliable witness. It worked. I tell Farrow that, more than once while discussing Weinstein in the early stages of the #MeToo movement, I heard myself say, \u201cRose McGowan sounds pretty nuts,\u201d in an echo of the language once used about Mia Farrow.\n\n\u201cRose McGowan, as it turns out, is very credible,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cThe claims she has made have checked out. She has not made a spurious accusation that I\u2019m aware of. She recounted details that eye witnesses at the time backed up and that documents backed up. Her personality is neither here nor there. To all of these men who were saying, \u2018Oh, but she\u2019s too crazy\u2019, I would say we interrogated her claims really, really hard. She\u2019s a great example of that dichotomy \u2013 of how sometimes, when people have sustained a lot of emotional damage and behave in a way that reflects that, they open themselves up to that criticism, particularly if they\u2019re women. It becomes a cudgel that\u2019s used to dismiss them.\u201d\n\nFixing a tattered reputation like Harvey Weinstein\u2019s is dirty work, but pays so well | Catherine Bennett Read more\n\nIt is a depressing landscape that can, at times, seem to offer no break in the flow of new alleged victims. But, says Farrow, \u201cI would not have written this book if I thought it was just a glum and dreary account of how broken our systems are, or how acute the power imbalances.\u201d It\u2019s true that, while the reach of the accused men is terrifying and the scope of the alleged crimes horrific, what one takes away from the story is also the sheer power and solidarity of the women who spoke up. \u201cIt is a hopeful story about how whistleblowers at every turn expose the truth.\u201d Film versions will follow \u2013 Farrow hasn\u2019t sold his screen rights yet, though Kantor and Twohey\u2019s have gone to Plan B, Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, in conjunction with Annapurna. The threats of legal action will rumble on. In January, Weinstein will plead not guilty in a Manhattan court. And Farrow will continue reporting.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "Farrow\u2019s investigation into the allegations against the producer won him a Pulitzer prize.
