Kyodo reported that proceedings could start as early as March.\n\nHe denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a boardroom coup.\n\nConfidence in Saikawa had already been shaken by accusations he was too close to Ghosn, whose arrest in November rocked the global auto industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and Renault SA.\n\nThe company launched its internal investigation after Japanese magazine Bungei Shunju in June published accusations by former director Greg Kelly that Saikawa was granted an exception in 2013 to reschedule a stock-linked bonus that bumped up the payout by 47 million yen ($445,962).\n\nLike Ghosn, Kelly is awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct which he denies.\n\nThe latest compensation issue could exacerbate tensions with top shareholder Renault, after a failed attempt by the French automaker to secure a full merger with Nissan and to combine Renault with Fiat Chrysler (FCA). Saikawa opposed both plans.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa attends a news conference to release first quarter earnings at the company headquarters in Yokohama, Japan July 25, 2019.

But a source close the company said Renault would \u201crespect Nissan\u2019s governance\u201d and leave the board to consider its response.\n\nThe alliance partners are discussing reforms that could win Nissan\u2019s support for a renewed FCA-Renault tie-up, including a potential reduction to Renault\u2019s 43.4% stake in Nissan.\n\nSaikawa was re-appointed by shareholders with the lowest approval rating among the 11 directors in June.", "description": "Nissan Motor Co was embroiled in another scandal over executive pay on Thursday after Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa admitted to being overpaid in violation of internal procedures under a scheme designed by ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn.", "authors": ["Maki Shiraki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426339997&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832HW", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
