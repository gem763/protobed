ordinary Britons will face the real and growing threat of food shortages, hunger and starvation.\n\n\u201cExtreme storms and floods are already causing major crop failures across the world, with high temperatures also hitting livestock agriculture.\n\n\u201cThis crisis may seem far away now but given the dependency of the UK on food imports, we are extremely vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe government must tell the truth and act now.\u201d\n\nProtesters will be gathering from 10am on Saturday, and according to an Extinction Rebellion spokesman, the blockade from 11am to 3pm \u201cwill not cause any disruption to vital supplies\u201d such as medicine.\n\nHe continued: \u201cExtinction Rebellion appreciates the blockade will directly affect ordinary people and businesses, but we feel the action is necessary in order to call the government to action.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Port of Dover said: \u201cWe are aware of the protest plans and as a result, Port of Dover Police are working closely with Kent Police to ensure as minimal disruption as possible.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Extinction Rebellion protesters are planning to blockade the Port of
