A checklist also gives patients the opportunity to ask doctors about their experience, education, training and credentials, the FDA said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have heard from many women that they are not fully informed of the risks when considering breast implants,\u201d FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy and Jeff Shuren, director of the agency\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health said in a statement Wednesday. The new recommendations are \u201cdesigned to help inform conversations between patients and health care professionals when breast implants are being considered,\u201d they added.\n\nAbout 75 percent of women who get breast implants do so for cosmetic reasons. Most of the rest get implants as part of reconstruction after surgery for breast cancer.\n\nThe proposed recommendations are in the form of a draft guidance to manufacturers. The FDA is asking for public comment for 60 days before finalizing the guidance.\n\nAD\n\nAt a dramatic hearing in March, many women who said they were hurt by breast implants demanded the FDA take tougher steps to ensure patients have more information about potential risks and to ban devices linked to the most serious complications, including cancer. In May, the agency said that it would not ban any implants at that time because it did not believe the product linked to cancer \u2014 a textured implant \u2014 met the legal standard for being banned.\n\nAD\n\nBut in July, implant maker Allergan announced a worldwide recall of its Biocell textured breast implants after the FDA found a sharp increase in a rare cancer and deaths linked to the products and asked the company to pull them from the U.S. market.\n\nThe FDA, in its proposed guidance on Wednesday, also called for new screening guidelines for possible ruptures, as well as a recommendation that manufacturers include product ingredient information in the device\u2019s labeling that is easy for patients to understand.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "After being criticized for years for not taking more aggressive action, the Food and Drug Administration recommended a boxed warning -- its most serious caution -- for breast implants.", "authors": ["Laurie Mcginley", "Reporter Covering Health"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ErsPMpPei6JZWr51OooDswKHZTU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPOWEUCO34I6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
