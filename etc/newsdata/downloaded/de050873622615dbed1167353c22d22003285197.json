It managed to secure some concessions on the Investor-State Dispute Settlement clauses which allow a foreign company to sue if disadvantaged by a government decision.\n\nLabor will try to implement protections against the importation of foreign workers without having to test the labour market first.\n\n\"Unless Labor can secure amendments to the proposed agreements which give expression to these important commitments to the Australian community, we ask that all Labor members of Parliament vote against legislation that will damage or undermine Australian workplace laws, access to employment opportunities and the economic welfare of our communities,\" the unions wrote.", "description": "Shadow cabinet is expected to endorse the big stick legislation regulating energy companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5612%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_32/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/493b6206b2a26ddda2e9e772be0407dbe574bd96", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
