Where is Becker?\n\nAlisson was nowhere to be seen after being announced as the FIFA Best Men's Goalkeeper\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp looked bemused at Allison's absence, as did Fabio Capello\n\n'I saw him before, where are you? Are you hiding?'\n\nWhen Alisson finally emerged, Gullit turned to co-presenter Ilaria D'Amico and said: 'You have to say it in Brazilian, in the Brazilian language. Or he did not expect to win.'\n\nEventually, the Brazil international did take to the stage, saying: 'Sorry, it's not my fault'.\n\nAlisson was eventually spotted, with the Brazil international making his way to the stage\n\nAfter finally receiving the award, Alisson apologised but added 'It's not my fault'\n\nIn addition to receiving the best goalkeeper award, Alisson was also named in the FIFA FIFPro men's team of the year along with his Liverpool team-mate Virgil van Dijk.\n\nAlisson enjoyed a superb first season at Liverpool as he helped Jurgen Klopp's side to win the Champions League, while he also produced some excellent displays in the Premier League.\n\nThe 26-year-old is currently out injured having suffered a calf problem against Norwich in the opening game of the Premier League season.", "description": "Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson was initially nowhere to be seen when he was announced as the winner of the\u00a0FIFA Best Men's Goalkeeper award.", "authors": ["Jeorge Bird For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/23/18846986-0-image-a-73_1569278394729.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
