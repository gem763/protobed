Contrary to popular belief, there is no one thing \u2013 whether that\u2019s red meat, bacon, toast, roast potatoes or anything else we eat \u2013 that raises the risk significantly.\n\nIt\u2019s overall diet that really matters. If we eat too much, we end up becoming overweight. But the fact that carrying too much fat, particularly around the middle, is linked to cancer is something that still surprises a lot of people.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got fat around your tummy, you probably also have quite a lot of visceral fat \u2013 that\u2019s the name for fat that builds up inside the abdomen and around the organs.\n\nThe cancers which are particularly strongly linked to excess fat are breast and bowel, two of our most common forms of the disease. So keeping to a healthy weight and keeping your tummy trim \u2013 ideally your waist should be less than half your height \u2013 are great ways to reduce your cancer risk. And I believe one of the best ways to do this is through intermittent fasting\n\nAnd it is a problem, because it doesn\u2019t just sit there, wobbling. Visceral fat is active, sending out signals to the rest of your body.\n\nSome of these signals make your cells divide more rapidly, which increases your risk of cancer, while others cause inflammation, another big driver of cancer.\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, being overweight or obese leads to about 22,800 new cases of cancer each year.\n\nThe cancers which are particularly strongly linked to excess fat are breast and bowel, two of our most common forms of the disease.\n\nCancers of the pancreas, oesophagus and gallbladder, all of which are extremely hard to treat, are also linked to obesity.\n\nSo keeping to a healthy weight and keeping your tummy trim \u2013 ideally your waist should be less than half your height \u2013 are great ways to reduce your cancer risk.\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, being overweight or obese leads to about 22,800 new cases of cancer each year.

This is one where you reduce your calories to about 600 twice a week.\n\nI suggested it would not only help you lose weight, but, according to studies carried out on animals, might also help cut your risk of developing cancer.\n\nSince then, studies in humans have indicated the same.\n\nSeven years ago I wrote a book, The Fast Diet, with journalist Mimi Spencer, in which we outlined the potential benefits of going on a 5:2 intermittent fasting diet. This is one where you reduce your calories to about 600 twice a week\n\nBritish scientists Dr Michelle Harvie and Professor Tony Howell have carried out studies that showed intermittent fasting helped improve insulin resistance in one group of women.\n\nInsulin resistance is a measure of how much of the hormone your body has to produce to bring your blood sugars down after a meal.\n\nAnother group of women who dieted every day also lost weight, but didn\u2019t see the same insulin improvement. This is important because having high levels of insulin increases your cancer risk.\n\nSo a combination of weight loss and improvement in insulin sensitivity could be highly beneficial.\n\nIn another more recent study, Dr Harvie asked 23 overweight, pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer to cut back their calories, two days a week, for one menstrual cycle.\n\nThis time, as well as standard tests, they agreed to have breast biopsies. Over the course of a month, the women lost an average of three kilos (more than 6 lb), most of it body fat.\n\nIn most of the women there were significant changes in the activity of genes associated with breast cancer.\n\nBigger studies would be needed to really prove intermittent fasting, rather than weight loss generally, was responsible. But the results are interesting.\n\nSKIPPING BREAKFAST COULD BE A GOOD IDEA\n\nIn The Fast Diet, I also wrote about a different form of intermittent fasting, one called time restricted eating. It\u2019s also known as 16:8, and you don\u2019t worry about calories when doing this plan. Instead, you limit the hours within which you eat your meals.\n\nMany of us don\u2019t finally finish eating and drinking until about 10pm thanks to a late-night snack, and then we start eating again soon after we wake up. That means we go without food for about nine hours.\n\nDO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR DR MOSLEY? Email drmosley@mailonsunday.co.uk or write to him at The Mail on Sunday, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT. Dr Mosley can only answer in a general context and cannot give personal replies.\n\nThe idea behind time restricted eating is to extend the length of your \u2018overnight fast\u2019 to 12, 14 or even 16 hours by finishing eating earlier in the evening and starting again much later \u2013 basically, skipping breakfast the following day.\n\nIt has been shown to help people lose weight. But can it also reduce your cancer risk?\n\nIn a large study, 2,400 American women with breast cancer were randomly allocated to either a low-fat diet or given general health advice.\n\nThey were then followed over the next seven years to see if going on a low-fat diet made any difference to the risk of breast cancer recurring. The answer was a resounding \u2018no\u2019.\n\nDespite reducing their fat intake by 19 per cent, the low-fat dieters were no better off than those in the control group.\n\nBut the great thing about this study, from the point of view of researchers investigating time restricted eating, is that the women were asked to keep detailed records of when they ate.\n\nThe women whose diaries showed that they had fasted for more than 13 hours a night had 36 per cent less chance of a breast cancer recurrence than those who had been fasting for under 13 hours.\n\nThere is a lot more information about intermittent fasting, foods and their impact on cancer in my latest book, the Fast 800.
