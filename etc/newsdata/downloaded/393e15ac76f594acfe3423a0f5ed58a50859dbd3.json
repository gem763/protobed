That tamps down business investment.\u201d\n\nStrategists said spending plans will be of particular interest as S&P 500 .SPX companies discuss their results for the third quarter in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe reporting period begins with big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and others reporting on Oct. 15.\n\nResults overall are expected to be relatively weak, with analysts forecasting earnings for S&P 500 companies to have declined 2.7% in the third quarter from a year ago, based on Refinitiv\u2019s data.\n\nRecent dismal economic indicators have fueled concerns that the United States was flirting with a recession.\n\nUpbeat jobs data offered some relief for investors on Friday, but it came on the heels of a report this week showing manufacturing activity plunged to a more than 10-year trough in September. Other data showed U.S. services sector activity slowed to a three-year low in September.\n\n\u201cThere is a correlation between CEO confidence and capex. And right now we\u2019ve seen CEO confidence decrease, so again it\u2019s going to be a challenging environment for companies to go ahead and spend,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Wall St. street sign is seen near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 17, 2019.

Bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by 25 basis points were at about 77% on Friday, compared to 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\n\u201cThis talk of whether or not we\u2019re going into a recession, that enforces prudence\u201d by companies, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, based in Newark, New Jersey. \u201cUltimately what they\u2019re worried about is revenue growth.\u201d", "description": "Investors are preparing for more cautious capital investment outlooks from U.S. companies as worries mount heading into earnings season about the possibility of an economic recession.", "authors": ["Caroline Valetkevitch", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437120079&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931F8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
