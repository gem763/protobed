Unfortunately, most of them think freedom is still a long way off.\n\nAssets across Europe briefly surged on Thursday as markets embraced the news that a Brexit deal had been struck in Brussels. But as traders assessed the obstacles ahead, the giddy mood faded. The deal -- struck just in time to present to EU leaders as they gather in Belgium\u2019s capital -- still needs the approval of the British Parliament. Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP, whose votes may be key, have said they will not back the accord.\n\n\u201cIt might not be time to pop open the champagne quite yet,\u201d said Jim McCormick (NYSE: ), the global head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cBut even if it is voted down by U.K. parliament the Tories will have a stronger hand heading into a general election. The dynamic clearly changed.\u201d\n\nHere are some early reactions from investors and strategists across Europe:\n\nPetr Krpata, chief currency strategist, ING Bank:\n\n\u201cThe deal announced but the key hurdle of the deal being voted into the U.K. Parliament remains. With the DUP not changing its position, it is questionable whether the deal will get through the Parliament. There is now risk the current deal will have the same fate of Theresa May\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe potential for sterling to rally is \u201cwatered down by the DUP comments and the subsequent uncertainty about the outcome of the Parliamentary vote.\u201d\n\nNick Wall, portfolio manager, Merian Global Investors:\n\n\u201cThe worst case scenario seems to be off the table in this Parliament and probably in the next if Johnson gets a majority. A near-term deal approved by parliament would probably help risk assets the most, but a setback should be short lived.\u201d\n\nSeema Shah, chief strategist, Principal Global Investors:\n\n\u201cInvestors should not be too enthusiastic as the endless negotiations and uncertainty over the past three years will take its toll on the country. Even with a Brexit agreement, the country will suffer a lot of economic pain as a result of the exit from the bloc.\u201d\n\nUwe Maderer, head of fixed income, LBBW Asset Management\n\n\u201cBrexit cliff edge seems to be over and that changes the market dynamics a bit, although the Parliamentary vote is still pending. The political will has clearly changed towards achieving a deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deal as it is all about goods and not services and only a low level of alignment with EU standards. That is clearly negative for longer term growth in the U.K. but surely better than no-deal and a WTO-based relationship with the EU.\u201d\n\nLars Kreckel, global equity strategist, Legal & General Investment Management:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to trade the twists and turns of the news flow. Generally, the stronger pound is bad for versus other markets, but some of that should be offset by international flows returning to U.K. equities.\u201d\n\nJim McCormick (NYSE: ) at NatWest again:\n\n\u201cWhat is different is that no one sees kicking the can down the road as an option any more. So old red lines are less red. I\u2019ve been bearish on German fixed income and this is certainly supportive. You may be seeing start of dollar turn as well. European political risks have been a dollar boost.\u201d\n\nJane Foley, head of currency strategy, Rabobank:\n\n\u201cWe have to remember that PM May had a deal too.\u201d\n\nAndreas Meyer, portfolio manager, Aramea Asset Management:\n\n\u201cAn important political obstacle seems to be resolved that paralyzed the market. However I do see essential residual risks, whether Johnson is able to push the deal through at home. That means more surprises might be ahead. Further cooperation with the EU (and not a hard deal) increases the likelihood that regulatory requirements for banks and insurance companies will be taken over by U.K. institutions and the stability of issuers will be maintained. I like to invest in HSBC, Lloyds (LON: ), RBS (LON: ), Barclays (LON: ) and now the bold Brexit stamp, which influenced them, is significantly weaker.\u201d\n\nRicardo Gil, head of asset allocation, Trea Asset Management in Madrid:\n\n\u201cThe deal is positive as it removes uncertainty that was weighing on the market, although most of the optimism may have already been priced in. I don\u2019t expect to increase our exposure to equity following the deal, but we will go longer on banks.\u201d\n\nArtur Baluszynski, head of research, Henderson Rowe:\n\n\u201cBig win for Boris. If he manages to get it through parliament, we should see a wave of risk-on trades coming into U.K. market.\u201d\n\nCMC\n\nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst,(NS: ) Markets:", "description": "\u2018No Champagne Yet\u2019\u00a0as Investors, Analysts Greet Brexit Deal With Caution", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbea83fd5cb904264e88f0715f7bae9fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
