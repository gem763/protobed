The Glove Boot is a knitted ankle boot with a stacked two-inch heel. If you loved Everlane\u2019s foot-molding ballet flat, the Day Glove (which we also give high marks), think of this as its more sustainable sister, in boot form. Each pair of Glove boots is constructed out of recycled polyester \u2014 nine recycled plastic bottles, to be precise.\n\nWhile Everlane has a robust collection of boot styles ranging from Western to Chelsea, the Glove Boot is the first of its kind to embrace the sock-boots trend. The ribbed, stretchy fabric may not make them ideal for braving rainstorms, but unlike a traditional leather boot, the knitted material comfortably hugs your feet so you can avoid the dreaded break-in period associated with leather.\n\nThe Glove Boot launched this week and costs $155, with five colors to choose from: black, a creamy beige called bone, toffee, and two vibrant colors, cobalt and tomato, for those who prefer life on the bright side.
