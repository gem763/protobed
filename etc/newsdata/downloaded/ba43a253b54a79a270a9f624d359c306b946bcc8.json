Just right, or one hinge too many? https://t.co/7SZUnvrFkO pic.twitter.com/qKYKE4wR8c \u2014 CNET (@CNET) October 24, 2019\n\nThe device doesn't currently have a name of a price, but according to CNET, its makers, TCL, which is known for building cheap televisions, plan on making a forray into phones with a number of bendable designs.\n\nEarlier this year, the company was rumored to have at least five folding devices in the works, including two tablets, two smartphones, and a type of wearable that swivels around one's wrist.\n\nThose concepts were portrayed in several renderings obtained by CNET earlier this year.\n\nTCL was reportedly in the early stages of developing these devices in January, and it's unclear if they'll hit the market as described or if the designs will change.\n\nThe firm has previously stated that it hopes to release a folding device by 2020.\n\nTCL won't be without plenty of competition when it comes to foldable gadgets.\n\nChinese tech giant TCL, which acquired the BlackBerry brand in 2016, is developing a flexible phone that can bend around your wrist to become a pseudo-smartwatch\n\nGALAXY FOLD SPECS Starts at $1,980 7.3-inch main display with Infinity Flex technology 4.6-inch outer display when folded 512 gb of Universal Flash Storage 3.0 7 nanometer processor 12gb of RAM Three rear-facing cameras Two front-facing cameras on main display, one camera when folded 'App continuity' technology to run three apps at once Comes in cosmic Black, Martian Green, Astro Blue and Space Silver\n\nHuawei's, $2,400 Mate X got an official release date for next month and will be among the first phones to pioneer a new breed of folding device.\n\nWhen open, the Mate X's display spans 8 inches and appears closer to a tablet. While closed, the phone folds onto itself for a more traditional-looking 6.6-inch display.\n\nThe only other folding device currently available to consumers is Samsung's Galaxy Fold which is slightly less expensive at $1,980.\n\nQuestions of durability have been among the most major issues for all folding devices and have plagued Samsung's Galaxy Fold.\n\nA design flaw that made the device's display vulnerable to dust and other particles postponed the Fold for several months this year.", "description": "The phone's multiple hinges, which form a 'Z' shape, extend into a 10-inch display when opened.
