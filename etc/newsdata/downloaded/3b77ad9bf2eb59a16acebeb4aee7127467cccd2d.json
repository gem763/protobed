Slice into wedges. Place on a piece of tin foil. Toss with 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper and top with three of the tarragon sprigs.\n\nClose the foil to form a packet with the beets inside. Place the packet in a baking dish and bake for 25 minutes or until you can easily insert a knife into the wedges. Take out of the oven and allow the beetroot to cool enough so you can handle it. Slip the skins off, discard the skins and set the beetroot aside.\n\nWhile the beetroot is cooking, make the dressing by combining the vinegar, mustard and oils. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nWash and spin dry the endive and radicchio.\n\nHeat a frying pan to medium heat and toast the walnuts. This will only take a few minutes. When they\u2019re golden brown, drizzle over the honey. Stir to coat, remove from the heat, and place the walnuts on a piece of greaseproof paper. Allow to cool.\n\nTo assemble the salad, place the endive and radicchio leaves on a platter. Add the beetroot wedges, leaves from the remaining two tarragon sprigs, the honey walnuts and drizzle the dressing over the salad.\n\n@juliapleonard", "description": "Salads and summer are a given \u2013 a natural when you want something light, crisp and veg-centric on a hot day.
