REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nThe most prominent of the 12 Catalan leaders on trial would be found guilty of charges of sedition and misuse of public funds but none would be convicted and sentenced for the more severe charge of rebellion, the source told Reuters.\n\nThe decision was taken unanimously by the seven members of the top court, the source added.\n\nThe verdict is expected to be signed by the judges and made public next week, most likely on Monday, the source said.\n\nA Supreme Court spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe ruling could provoke a strong reaction in Catalonia, where a secessionist push two years ago triggered Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades.\n\nIt could also complicate Spanish politics in the run-up to the fourth national election in four years.\n\nThe charges stem from the leaders\u2019 role in an October 2017 referendum, held despite being ruled illegal by Spanish courts, and a short-lived declaration of independence that followed in Spain\u2019s most economically important region.\n\nNine of the 12 Catalan politicians and civic leaders have been in pre-trial detention for close to two years.\n\nThe public prosecutor had accused all the nine jailed leaders of rebellion charges and sought the longest prison term, 25 years, for Oriol Junqueras, former deputy leader of the Catalan regional government at the time. But the court plans to sentence him to 13-15 years in jail, the judicial source said.\n\nSedition is considered a crime against public order, while rebellion implies stronger actions.\n\nThe sentencing years would be lower for the other eight leaders already in jail, the source said. The three politicians that are currently out of prison would be found guilty of disobedience, which does not lead to imprisonment, it added.\n\nIn the trial\u2019s final arguments in June, separatist leaders said they did nothing wrong and that they were being prosecuted for political acts, while some of their lawyers admitted that they could have been guilty of disobedience but denied the much more serious rebellion charge.\n\n\u201cUNFAIR\u201d\n\nSeparatist parties have called for massive but peaceful civil disobedience if the leaders are not acquitted.\n\n\u201cA ruling that is not absolutory is completely unfair,\u201d said on Saturday at a party event Pere Aragones, a top official of left-wing Catalan separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Catalonia\u2019s Republican Left), whose chairman is Junqueras.\n\n\u201cThey have tried to behead us and now they want to culminate it but they will not achieve it ... they will not make disappear the millions of separatists in this country,\u201d he added, the party said in a statement.\n\nAnti-independence centre-right party Ciudadanos made a direct appeal to Spain\u2019s acting Socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez to uphold the much-anticipated verdict.\n\n\u201cWhatever the sentence is he must stick to it, not pardon [the jailed leaders] or give them undeserved privileges in prison,\u201d said Ciudadanos\u2019 parliamentary spokeswoman Ines Arrimadas at a unionist rally in Barcelona.\n\nMajor Spanish newspapers including El Pais, La Vanguardia and El Mundo have published similar information about the sentence, also citing sources.", "description": "Spain's Supreme Court plans to convict and sentence Catalan separatist leaders to a maximum of 15 years in prison over a 2017 bid for independence, a judicial source said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440046281&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0CF", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
