Then, the National Weather Service had to correct the president, tweeting that the state \u201cwill NOT see any impacts\u201d from the storm. But apparently, that wasn\u2019t enough for Trump.\n\nAs The Daily Show\u2019 s Trevor Noah pointed out Wednesday night, the president appeared to show reporters a doctored map that displayed the hurricane reaching the corner of Alabama.\n\nWhen one reporter asked Trump if the map was altered to include the state, he stammered, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he draw with a Sharpie?\u201d Noah asked in disbelief. \u201cLike, guys, what is life right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m impressed that Trump can locate Alabama on a map. But still, the president of the United States just changed a map with a Sharpie to make himself look right. And he thought we wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nIt was \u201ceither that or he wanted to give the hurricane bigger boobs,\u201d Noah joked, before imagining someone telling Trump that the hurricane was a category 5. \u201c\u2018Uh, actually, now it\u2019s a 10,\u2019\u201d he said as Trump.", "description": "\u201cThe president of the United States just changed a map with a Sharpie to make himself look right.
