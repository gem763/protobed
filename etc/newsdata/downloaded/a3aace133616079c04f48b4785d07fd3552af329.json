REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nMetro stations reopened after some were closed on Sunday amid sometimes violent confrontations, although the mood in the Asian financial hub remained tense.\n\nEarly on Monday, before school started, rows of students and alumni joined hands chanting \u201cHong Kong people, add oil\u201d, a phrase which has become a rallying cry of encouragement for the protest movement.\n\n\u201cThe school-based human chain is the strongest showcase of how this protest is deep rooted in society, so deep rooted that it enters through the school students,\u201d said Alan Leong, an alumnus of Wah Yan College in the city\u2019s Kowloon district.\n\nThree months of protests over a now withdrawn extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the government and greater calls for democracy.\n\nActivists had started fires in the street and vandalized a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in the main business district of Central on Sunday after thousands rallied peacefully at the U.S. consulate, calling for help in bringing democracy to the special administrative region.\n\nThe students, brandishing posters with the protesters\u2019 five demands for the government, called on authorities to respond to the promises of freedom, human rights and rule of law.University students were also expected to join the human chain protests during the day on their campuses.\n\nOne of the five demands - to formally withdraw the extradition bill - was announced last week by the city government leader, Carrie Lam, but protesters are angry about her failure to call an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality during demonstrations.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 other demands include the retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe demonstrations, the release of all those arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\nIn a rare public appearance, Lam walked around the central business district inspecting the damaged MTR station, where she chatted with staff and commuters.\n\nDressed in a black suit, she examined electronic ticketing machines and boarded up windows smashed a day earlier, the public broadcaster RTHK showed.\n\n\u2018CORE VALUES\u2019\n\nFollowing the demonstration at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, Hong Kong\u2019s government warned foreign lawmakers not to interfere in the internal affairs of the former British colony after thousands of protesters called on U.S. President Donald Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d the city.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling in the city\u2019s affairs and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nChinese state media on Monday said Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China and any form of secessionism \u201cwill be crushed\u201d.\n\nThe China Daily newspaper said Sunday\u2019s rally was proof foreign forces were behind the protests and warned demonstrators should \u201cstop trying the patience of the central government\u201d.\n\nYoung pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was released from police custody on Monday after breaching bail conditions following his arrest in August when he was charged along with a number of other prominent activists for inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was monitoring events in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong, and those freedoms must be vigorously protected.
