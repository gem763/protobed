The collateral damage or gains from these moves is unknown.\n\nThe only certainty, perhaps, is that nothing will stay the same.", "description": "Boris Johnson has lost his first vote as prime minister but in the long-term will that benefit or harm him?", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99E6/production/_108589393_mediaitem108589391.jpg"}
