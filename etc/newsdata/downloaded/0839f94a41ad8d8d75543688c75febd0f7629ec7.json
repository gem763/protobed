Instead, the spacewalk lineup was shuffled to have the women working alongside male crewmates.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the team-up of spacewalkers Christina Koch and Jessica Meir is coming nearly a week earlier than planned, due to an urgent problem on the International Space Station.\n\nThe space station\u2019s crew is in the midst of a battery replacement campaign that requires five spacewalks to complete. Two spacewalks have already been done, and Koch and Meir were scheduled to take their turn on Oct. 21.\n\nBut just a few days ago, mission managers determined that a battery charge-discharge unit, or BCDU, wasn\u2019t working properly with a new set of batteries.\n\nThe BCDUs regulate the amount of electrical charge that the station\u2019s solar arrays put into the power system\u2019s batteries. NASA says the unit\u2019s failure after 19 years of operation doesn\u2019t immediately affect station operations or crew safety, but it does prevent the new batteries from providing the expected increase in power.\n\nA similar BCDU failure occurred in April, and the station is now down to only three or four spares. Mission managers are anxious to resolve the latest glitch and figure out what the problem is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a concern at this point, when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Kenny Todd, NASA\u2019s manager of space station operations and integration, told reporters when the latest schedule change was announced. \u201cWe\u2019re still scratching our heads looking at the data.\u201d\n\nThe need to fix the glitch led NASA to reshuffle the schedule once again \u2014 and as a result, revise the plan for making space history.\n\nWomen have been doing spacewalks ever since Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya ventured outside the Salyut 7 space station in 1984, followed months later by NASA shuttle astronaut Kathryn Sullivan\u2019s outing. But those spacewalkers, and all of the women who followed in their footsteps, did their work in the company of men. Friday\u2019s spacewalk will finally break that precedent.\n\nMegan McArthur, deputy chief of NASA\u2019s astronaut office, said the milestone merely reflects how the astronaut corps has evolved from its all-male beginnings.\n\n\u201cIt will be an exciting event, something we will reflect on certainly after the fact,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in truth, in terms of looking at the workload that we have coming forward, this was the right crew to send out to do this set of tasks. All of our crew members are completely qualified to do this, and the fact that it will be two women just is a reflection of the fact that we have so many capable, qualified women in the office.\u201d\n\nNASA will carry streaming-video coverage of spacewalk activities beginning at 6:30 a.m. ET (3:30 a.m. PT) Friday.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Ken Bowersox, a former astronaut who\u2019s been serving as the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations, will talk about the milestone during a media teleconference starting at 7:15 a.m. ET (4:15 a.m. PT).\n\nThe spacewalk itself is due to start around 7:50 a.m. ET (4:50 a.m. PT) and last about five and a half hours.\n\nNASA had planned to conduct three more battery-replacement spacewalks this month, but they\u2019ve been put on hold pending the results of Friday\u2019s operation. Mission managers plan to have the faulty battery charge-discharge unit brought back down to Earth for troubleshooting.\n\nCheck back for updates as the spacewalk proceeds, and watch the video coverage below.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "Friday's first all-female spacewalk is coming later than expected, and also earlier than expected.
