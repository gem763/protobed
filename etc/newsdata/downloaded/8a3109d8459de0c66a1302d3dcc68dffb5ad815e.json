(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nCalifornia governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, has accepted large donations from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a utility company he now excoriates for \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201cmismanagement.\u201d\n\nPG&E has faced widespread criticism for implementing blackouts for millions of customers to avoid sparking wildfires in the midst of California\u2019s dry and windy fall weather.\n\n\u201cI have a message for PG&E,\u201d Newsom wrote on Twitter on Friday. \u201cYour years and years of greed. Years and years of mismanagement. Years and years of putting shareholders over people. Are OVER.\u201d\n\nNewsom and allies accepted $208,400 from the utility during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, according to local affiliate ABC10. Of that total, $150,000 went to a political spending group called \u201cCitizens Supporting Gavin Newsom for Governor 2018,\u201d while the rest went to directly to Newsom\u2019s campaign.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019. Faulty PG&E electricity equipment has been blamed for sparking several wildfires in the past decade.\n\nCalifornia has consistently shut down proposals to clear dead trees from forests and to trim trees near power lines state wide, creating conditions for a rash of wildfire outbreaks in recent years.\n\nThe Kincaid Fire currently burning in Sonoma County in the northern part of the state has forced the evacuation of roughly 200,000 people. The fire is twice the size of the city of San Fransisco.\n\nNewsom declared a state of emergency on Sunday in response to the Kincaid Fire and several other wildfires throughout the state. He again threatened PG&E in a statement on the situation.\n\n\u201cThere is a plan to get out of this. This is not the new normal,\u201d Newsom said on Sunday at an evacuation center in northern California. \u201cThis is not a 10-year process to deal with this. That will not be the case\u2026 [PG&E] will be held to account to do something radically different", "description": "Governor Gavin Newsom has accepted large donations from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a utility company he now excoriates for \"greed\" and \"mismanagement.\"", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
