The public may register and participate in the simultaneous virtual exercise in English, 8:50 a.m.-12:30 p.m. EDT at centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/. The exercise underscores the need for global public-private cooperation to mitigate economic and societal impacts of severe pandemics.\n\nIn recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, about 200 per year, which strain limited resources. A large global pandemic would be disruptive to health, economies, and society. Economic studies show that pandemics could be the cause of an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global GDP\u2014or $570 billion.\n\nEvent 201, played by 15 leaders of businesses, governments, and public health, will illustrate realistic policy problems that must be addressed under pressure during a pandemic. At the video-driven exercise, players will be presented with a scenario that reveals unresolved and controversial policy and economic issues that could be solved with sufficient political will, financial investment, and attention.\n\n\u201cIn addition to challenging health and health systems, pandemics can cause severe cascading economic and societal consequences,\u201d said Tom Inglesby, MD, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cNeither governments nor private industries alone can adequately respond to a severe pandemic; they must work together. We\u2019ve designed Event 201 to engage leaders in compelling ways to help them understand the decisions needed to prepare for and respond to biological threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutbreaks of infectious disease are inevitable, but the economic damage they cause is not,\u201d said Ryan Morhard, project lead for Global Health Security at the World Economic Forum. \u201cSustained attention from a broad multistakeholder coalition is needed in advance of a severe pandemic to save lives and minimize economic and societal consequences.\u201d\n\nChris Elias, president of global development at the Gates Foundation, noted that \u201cEvent 201 and its predecessor simulations like Clade X are crucial tools to understand not only what is needed to effectively respond to global public health crises, but also the consequences of what happens when we are not prepared.\u201d\n\nThe exercise is supported by funding from the Open Philanthropy Project.\n\nMore information is at centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201, #Event201, @JHSPH_CHS, @wef and @gatesfoundation.\n\nEVENT 201 IS A FICTIONAL EXERCISE AND DISEASE\n\nEditor\u2019s note: RSVP for a confirmed seat, information about camera and recording limitations; access same day to video, graphics, audio, photos and interviews.
