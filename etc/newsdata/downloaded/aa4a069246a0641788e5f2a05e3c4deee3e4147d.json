Jake teases her about her apparent refusal to consider that life in New Zealand could be more than just a break from the frenetic stateside pace she\u2019s accustomed to. This isn\u2019t a groundbreaking admonishment, nor is it a new tension to emerge in a rom-com pairing. Something New (2006), for example, saw the accountant Kenyan (Sanaa Lathan) shocked to find herself falling for her landscaper, Brian (Simon Baker). Romantic comedies have long featured class differences between professional women and their unexpected suitors\u2014and the reverse as well.\n\nBut Falling Inn Love and Always Be My Maybe capture a distinctly modern sense of exhaustion: Their protagonists are ambitious, oft-underestimated women who have to work at everything. They are young, capable, hyper-focused, and seriously burned out Millennials. The films critique the Bay Area workaholism most explicitly through the women\u2019s romantic partners. Always Be My Maybe\u2019s Marcus, Sasha\u2019s onetime friend and future lover, takes aim at the corporate artifice he sees her participating in. \u201cDoes it get tiring doing that?\u201d he asks Sasha early in the film; while adjusting a vent in her massive home, he has overheard her on a business call. \u201cIt\u2019s just funny because I know it\u2019s not you, that voice.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Gabriela\u2019s case, Jake expresses an even broader skepticism based on cultural differences in addition to temperamental ones. When Gabriela\u2019s old boss calls her to offer her a job that would require her to move back to the Bay Area\u2014\u201cFinish up your Habitat for Hobbits and get on a plane\u201d is how he puts it\u2014Jake is shocked that his love interest (who\u2019s also become his business partner) would consider such a regression. \u201cWhy would you want to work for a jerk like that?\u201d he asks, before continuing the line of inquiry: \u201cSo that\u2019s it? Back to America, back to the hamster wheel, working for some soulless corporation.\u201d\n\nThe conversation leads to an icy split between the two. When Dean arrives following a sneaky scheme from a rival innkeeper, he offers to help sell Gabriela and Jake\u2019s rehabbed inn to a foreign investor while simultaneously mocking the pair for their HGTV-esque efforts: \u201cSo you\u2019re like a regular Chip and Joanna Gaines, huh?\u201d he observes. Spurred partly by her irritation with Dean\u2019s tech fixation, Gabriela decides to stay in New Zealand. (Again, this film has few surprises.) In her new life, there are handwritten love letters, hill-covered vistas, and even a \u201csuper chill\u201d stray goat; she certainly doesn\u2019t miss Silicon Valley. And for overworked viewers who can\u2019t duplicate her move away from the hamster wheel, it\u2019s still refreshing to see characters such as Gabriela find some peace.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
