But nowadays you\u2019re more into Lizzo. You also once went through a phase of being obsessed with houseplants, but have lately gotten into collecting ballpoint pens.\n\nPeople\u2019s tastes and interests change. So why should our Google data histories be eternal?\n\nFor years, Google has kept a record of our internet searches by default. The company hoards that data so it can build detailed profiles on us, which helps it make personalized recommendations for content but also lets marketers better target us with ads. While there have been tools we can use to manually purge our Google search histories, few of us remember to do so.\n\nSo I\u2019m recommending that we all try Google\u2019s new privacy tools. In May, the company introduced an option that lets us automatically delete data related to our Google searches, requests made with its virtual assistant and our location history.\n\nOn Wednesday , Google followed up by expanding the auto-delete ability to YouTube. In the coming weeks, it will begin rolling out a new private mode for when you\u2019re navigating to a destination with its Google Maps app, which could come in handy if you\u2019re going somewhere you want to keep secret, like a therapist\u2019s office.", "description": "Google has now given us an option to set search and location data to automatically disappear after a certain time.
