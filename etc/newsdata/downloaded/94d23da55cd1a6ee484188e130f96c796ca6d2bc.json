The men\u2019s nationalities were unclear, though both were believed to have been born in former Soviet republics.\n\nMr. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump\u2019s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, through an LLC called Global Energy Producers, according to Federal Election Commission records\u2026\n\nMessrs. Parnas and Fruman had a dinner with the president in early May 2018, according to since-deleted Facebook posts captured in a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. They also met with the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. , later that month at a fundraising breakfast in Beverly Hills, Calif., along with Tommy Hicks Jr. , a close friend of the younger Mr. Trump who at the time was heading America First Action. Mr. Parnas posted a photo of their breakfast four days after his LLC donated to the super PAC.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles Reflink Share_Mobilewebshare"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
