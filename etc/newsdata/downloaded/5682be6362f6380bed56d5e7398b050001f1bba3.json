USA TODAY\n\nMIAMI \u2013 Atlanta guard Trae Young left the Hawks\u2019 game in Miami on Tuesday night early in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle.\n\nYoung was hurt on a drive about 2 minutes into the second quarter. He went into the air and landed on the foot of Miami\u2019s Justise Winslow, twisting his ankle awkwardly. Young was eventually helped to his feet, unable to put any weight on that leg, and went to the Hawks locker room for further evaluation.\n\nThe Hawks quickly diagnosed the sprain and said Young would not return to the game.\n\nYoung was the Eastern Conference player of the week for the opening week of the season. He entered Tuesday averaging 34 points through Atlanta\u2019s first three games. He scored five points in 11 minutes on Tuesday.\n\nTrae Young is in the Hawks locker room after rolling his ankle \ud83d\ude2c\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @DimeUPROXX\n\npic.twitter.com/fbPWwDbJvN \u2014 USA TODAY NBA (@usatodaynba) October 30, 2019\n\nYoung played in 81 of 82 games as a rookie, only sitting out the team\u2019s next-to-last game at Milwaukee. His 11 minutes on Tuesday were a career low, and the five points tied the second-lowest scoring night of his young career.
