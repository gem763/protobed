(Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asserted that the Russians are attempting to undermine the 2020 election by backing Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) as a third-party candidate, stating \u201cshe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nAppearing on Obama campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, Clinton made a number of claims regarding Russian meddling in U.S. elections, including that Gabbard\u2019s substantial social-media support relies on Russian bots. Gabbard was the most-searched candidate after the first and second Democratic debates.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said on the podcast. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nAlthough Clinton did not explicitly mention Gabbard\u2019s name, when asked if the accusation was leveled at the Hawaii Congresswoman, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s comments come after Gabbard called the coverage of her campaign by The New York Times and CNN \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d during the fourth Democratic debate Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling to an end to this regime-change war,\u201d Gabbard told the crowd in Ohio. \u201cJust two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying I am a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia.\u201d\n\nIn August, Gabbard also told CNN that she would not run as a third-party candidate if she does not win the Democratic nomination.\n\nClinton also labelled Green Party candidate Jill Stein a \u201cRussian asset\u201d and suggested on the podcast that Gabbard is playing a similar role in this election.\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate . . . I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed,\u201d Clinton declared.\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s election, the Clinton campaign followed Jill Stein\u2019s demands for a recount in Wisconsin, which ultimately gave Trump 131 more votes.\n\n\u201cBecause we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\u201d campaign lawyer Marc Elias said at the time.", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asserted that the Russians are attempting to undermine the 2020 election by backing Tulsi Gabbard.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
