I am an extraordinary black trans woman and I deserve to be here. My black trans sisters that are here, I am tired. I am so tired of just sitting there.\u201d\n\nThe activist identified herself as Blossom when CNN host Don Lemon stepped in to de-escalate the situation.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we are here is to validate people like you,\u201d Lemon told Blossom. \u201cThat is why we are here.\u201d\n\nAs Blossom continued to speak to the crowd, Lemon stood on stage with Democrat presidential hopeful Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke.
