There is outrage brewing here, too, and it concerns the X button on the PlayStation controller.\n\nA fortnight ago, Twitter user @drip133 asked a seemingly innocent question above a photo of the joypad: \u201cDo you say \u2018x\u2019 or \u2018cross\u2019 button?\u201d There were hundreds of contradictory responses, which became increasingly furious as the week wore on. Some insisted that because the other buttons are named after shapes \u2013 Triangle, Square and Circle \u2013 logically, the \u201cX\u201d button must be called \u201cCross\u201d; others pointed out that as \u2018X\u2019 was the common usage, this was the only acceptable pronunciation.\n\nMany began to bring maths, design and etymology into the debate. With the likes of:\n\nKanra (@KanraNakurax2) A cross is \u2795, not \u2716 you pelicans\n\nWeighing in against tweets such as:\n\nn\u0454r\u03c3 \u03b1g\u0454nt cr\u00edms\u03c3n (@SIECrimson) Because this debate grinds my gears, I'll finish it once and for all:\n\n\n\n- Crosses have the same distance between each stick.\n\n- Crosses form a square.\n\n\n\n- Exes don't have the same distance between each stick.\n\n- Exes form a rectangle.\n\n\n\nBasic geometry. pic.twitter.com/gz8jCJd3Bn\n\nThen, in a shock move, Sony itself became involved. On 5 September, the official Twitter feed of PlayStation UK stated:\n\nPlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) Triangle\n\nCircle\n\nCross\n\nSquare\n\n\n\nIf Cross is called X (it's not), then what are you calling Circle?\ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/dvQ19duemW\n\nThe scrap is a rare event in the world of video games as console manufacturers usually name buttons after numbers, unambiguous letters of the alphabet or colours. The groundbreaking Nintendo Entertainment System pad, for example, went with A, B, while the SNES added X and Y (a configuration also used by Sega and Microsoft), and in this context, it\u2019s clear that \u201cX\u201d is X.\n\nThe only other major console controller to utilise symbols was the disastrous Apple Bandai Pippen, which featured raised dots on its four main buttons as well as a sequence of buttons on the front of the pad, which in turn featured three shapes: \u201csquare\u201d, \u201ccircle\u201d and \u201cdiamond\u201d. There was little controversy over what to call any of these buttons, however, because a), Apple avoided the contentious \u201cX\u201d symbol and b), no one bought an Apple Bandai Pippin.\n\nYears ago, in an interview with the now defunct video game website 1UP, Sony designer Teiyu Goto explained how the buttons came to be named:\n\nWe wanted something simple to remember, which is why we went with icons or symbols, and I came up with the triangle-circle-X-square combination immediately afterward. I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one\u2019s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively.\n\nSadly, this doesn\u2019t really help because in the quote he has characterised the \u201cX\u201d button with an \u201cX\u201d symbol and who knows whether that was actually him or the journalist who wrote the piece. Also, what is the symbol you put on a piece of paper when voting? Do you call it a cross or an \u201cX\u201d? Surely it\u2019s a matter of opinion?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crossed wires \u2026 the Dualshock. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nCertainly, in common gamer vernacular the \u201cX\u201d button is very much pronounced as \u201cX\u201d and not \u201dcross\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s quicker to say and the sound of \u201cpress X\u201d is smoother and more pleasing than \u201cpress cross\u201d with its awkward stuttering repeat of the \u201cs\u201d sound. When you\u2019re trying to shout instructions to a team mate in a fraught online gun battle, you want the instruction to be as brief, seamless and audible as possible and \u201cX\u201d fulfils this role.\n\nAs lexicographers know, language is a fluid concept and no meaning or intention is ever immune from common variation and usage. If people want to misuse \u201cliterally\u201dthey will; if they think \u201cdisinterested\u201d is synonymous with \u201cuninterested, they\u2019re wrong, but if you point it out, it will be you who is judged. In this burning dispute, Sony\u2019s intervention is irrelevant because the players have spoken. X means X.\n\nOr as @Arbiterwarpig eloquently put it: \u201cAnyone who says cross is a cop\u201d.", "description": "Sony has confirmed \u2018X\u2019 button on Dualshock controller should be called \u2018Cross\u2019 and players are freaking out", "authors": ["Keith Stuart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69cf5660dfc343fb5f13e754fbbc74040d34e996/0_101_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bc030950478c5ed5c4724b3352054fa", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
