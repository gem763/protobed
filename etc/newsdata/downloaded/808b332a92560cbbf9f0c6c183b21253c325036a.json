Any team can be beaten on any day and we just have to try to make sure we do that at Anfield.\n\n(Image: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)\n\n\u201cAs a striker, it\u2019s not just \u00adone-v-one on the pitch, there\u2019s a lot that goes into it. Van Dijk is an amazing defender and he has had a fantastic couple of years at Liverpool.\n\n\u201cSo, from my point of view, it\u2019s just about playing my game and making my movements, making my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a team game, so we all have to be on it with each other and that\u2019s the main aim.\u201d\n\nTottenham never really got going in the European showdown with Liverpool in June and they have stuttered and spluttered their way through the first three months of this season.\n\n(Image: DPA/PA Images)\n\nKane added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a little bit of a \u00adrivalry over the last couple of years because we\u2019ve been competing at the top of the Premier League and the Champions League \u2013 and that\u2019s what happens when you get two good teams at a high level.\n\n\u201cYou want to win, you want to come out on top and they came out on top in May, or June, whenever it was\u2026 I\u2019ve tried to forget it,\u201d he said, with a rueful laugh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ll have played them since, but that\u2019s in the past, we must concentrate on us now and we have a lot to do to turn our Premier League season around.\u201d\n\nKane is hoping Tuesday\u2019s 5-0 trouncing of Serbian side Red Star Belgrade in the \u00adChampions League can be a platform to help them do that.\n\nHe added: \u201cMomentum-wise, that will give us a huge lift.\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s game was great, but we were expected to win it at home.\n\n\u201cProbably not many \u00adpeople will expect us to win away at Anfield, so, if we can do that, it will hopefully give our \u00adPremier League season a big boost.\u201d\n\nThe game has the potential to be \u00adexplosive with two of the most entertaining attacking units in Europe on show.\n\nKane said: \u201cThey have a great attacking trio or four, but so have a lot of teams in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the top six now, there are a lot of great attacking players.\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s not just the attack that is going to win the game, it\u2019s the defence, the whole team and that\u2019s what we have to do, we have to stick \u00adtogether and try to get the win.\n\n\u201cObviously, it will be a very tough game. They have started the season as well as anyone, especially their home form.\n\n\u201cThey have a great crowd, who really get behind their team and try to push them on, so it\u2019ll be a tough game.\n\n\u201cBut we have have been there before, we\u2019ve picked up results there before, so we just have to concentrate on us and do what we can \u2013 and try to perform like we did on Tuesday.\u201d", "description": "Kane has fired shots at Liverpool ahead of the Tottenham clash and believes Spurs have a chance for victory", "authors": ["Tom Hopkinson", "Image", "Tottenham Hotspur Fc Via Getty I", "Dpa Pa Images", "Camerasport Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732357.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tottenham-Hotspur-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
