So bad for our Country!\u2019\n\n\u201cSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\u201d Trump said via Twitter minutes after Pelosi\u2019s late-afternoon announcement:\n\nSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThe president also referred the latest political development as \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d \u2014 in capital letters followed by an exclamation point:\n\nPelosi, a California Democrat who\u2019s serving as speaker of the House for the second time, said \u201cthe president must be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one,\u201d she said, \u201cis above the law.\u201d\n\nCheck out: Why Trump impeachment threat is suddenly rattling stock-market investors\n\nThe swift move this week toward impeachment was prompted by a Trump phone call with Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelensky on July 25. At issue is a whistleblower complaint surrounding Trump\u2019s interaction or interactions with Zelensky.\n\nTrump, it has been reported by the Wall Street Journal, asked his acting chief of staff to withhold some $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as Trump urged the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Democrats, on Wednesday, will vote to condemn the Trump administration for withholding the whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s Ukraine call.\n\nTrump has played down his dealings with the Ukrainian president and said he plans to release an \u201cunredacted\u201d transcript of the phone conversation on Wednesday. \u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter earlier Tuesday.\n\n\u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d\n\n....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThe president also tweeted a video montage of Democrats advocating for his impeachment \u2014 a goal for many Trump critics amid investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which was the subject of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s now concluded inquiry.\n\nTo be sure, impeachment doesn\u2019t translate to removal from office. Most recently, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House in 1998 but acquitted by the Senate. Clinton\u2019s impeachment had very little impact on the stock market.\n\nSo far, stock-market reaction to the Pelosi announcement has been subdued in after-hour trading, following a slump amid early reports of her intention to launch a formal inquiry. The Dow DJIA, -0.53% closed lower by 141.81 points, or 0.5%, at 26,806.18, while the benchmark S&P 500 SPX, -0.84% declined 25.16 points, or 0.8%, to 2,966.62. The Nasdaq COMP, -1.46% was off more sharply, surrendering 118.84 points, or 1.5%, to finish the day at 7,993.63.\n\nAfter the closing bell, however, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA, -0.52% was up 0.2% on light volume, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, -0.78% was trading flat but narrowly in positive territory, while the Nasdaq-100 NDX, -1.39% was up 1.4%. Futures for the Dow YMZ19, +0.24% , S&P ESZ19, +0.23% and Nasdaq NQZ19, +0.24% weren\u2019t being traded.\n\nBarron\u2019s on MarketWatch: Trump impeachment is less important on Wall Street than in Washington", "description": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday afternoon goes on Twitter tirade after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FV768_17trum_ZG_20171005204139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
