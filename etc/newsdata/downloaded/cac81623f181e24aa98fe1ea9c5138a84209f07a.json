Order your copy here.\n\nOn 17 June 2019 Le Pagliere, a 19th century hay manger in the heart of Florence, pulsed with an electrifying experiment in fashion-craft and catwalk theatre from Sterling Ruby. As he unveiled his new fashion project, S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA., the prolific LA-based multidisciplinary artist provided the standout show of the spring/ summer 20 men\u2019s season.\n\nWhether it\u2019s with glossy and colour-saturated poured-polyurethane sculptures, dark drawings, richly glazed ceramics, graffiti-inspired spray paintings or drone-shot video works \u2014 throughout the 20 years of his eclectic and uncompromising practice, Sterling Ruby has explored the triumphs, tragedies and weirdness of the American experience across an ever-evolving range of media. Whatever the medium, he has long delighted in the duality between the fluid and the static, the minimalist and the expressionist, the pristine and the filthy, the dream and the nightmare, creation and destruction.\n\nSterling credits this visceral provocative playfulness to his childhood in rural Pennsylvania, describing himself as \u201ca problematic kid who absolutely hated where I lived, which was this macho community in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Channeling this outsider spirit into his art, Sterling been described as \u201cone of the most interesting artists to emerge in this century\u201d by the New York Times art critic, Roberta Smith. Now, after his standalone catwalk debut, we\u2019d say he might also be one of the most interesting fashion designers to emerge too. And we\u2019re not alone. \u201cThat was the best new-person collection I have ever seen,\u201d Suzy Menkes, the world-renowned critic who has reported from the front lines of fashion for more than three decades, declared as she joined us backstage in the post-show circle of iPhone-wielding interviewers.\n\n\u201cMaking clothing started out very privately. Wearing it personally, and occasionally gifting it to friends, it w as really only seen by the people closest to me.\u201d Sterling Ruby\n\nThroughout his varied artistic practice the constant has been an assault on materials and social structures, referencing marginalised societies and maximum-security prisons, modernist architecture, artefacts and antiquities, graffiti, bodybuilders and warfare, cults and gangs. There are artists who are known for a repetition of gesture or form, like Francis Bacon or Clyfford Still, whom Sterling admires, but the allure of working across multiple mediums is too great for Sterling. \u201cI don\u2019t like one material in particular,\u201d he tells us in a soft voice behind a mischievous smile, \u201cI switch from one thing to another because I am restless.\u201d Fortunately, this restlessness has led him to fashion.\n\nWhile many assume that Sterling\u2019s relationship to clothing design evolved from his collaborations with Raf Simons, it actually all began when he was just 13 years old. After his family relocated from Baltimore to a farm in a town called New Freedom, Pennsylvania, he took up sewing. While his friends were at football practice, a teenage Sterling would sit at his mother\u2019s Singer sewing machine, making early versions of the spliced and sewn fabric pieces that have since become a signature of his work. \u201cMy mother sewed, my grandmother sewed, my aunts sewed,\u201d he tells us. But even then, his urge to craft and create was always coupled with a desire to deface, destroy and reimagine. He spent his time \u201ccutting off the sleeves and collars, patching them back together, then adding hand-painted and stenciled materials,\u201d and pulled inspiration from the fashion of punk scene that soundtracked his coming-of-age. \u201cI remember my mother being upset with me because I kept bending her bobbin and needle clamp,\u201d Sterling recalls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the behavioural power that comes with clothing,\u201d Sterling explains. It was an interest sparked by the sight of seeing H.R. from Bad Brains dressed in double denim, Black Flag\u2019s Gren Ginn in his favoured Oxford shirts and Henry Rollins in black running shorts when a teenage Sterling made trips to Baltimore and Washington to watch his hardcore punk heroes. For as long as he can remember, he has been exploring garments as a medium that impacts the way we can think, feel, and move. \u201cThis project, making clothing, started out very privately,\u201d he adds. \u201cWearing it personally, and occasionally gifting it to friends, my clothing was really only seen by the people closest to me.\u201d Whether backstage at a Rick Owens show or at one of his exhibition openings, whenever we\u2019ve crossed paths with Sterling, he\u2019s been wearing his own garments.\n\nBeyond these private explorations, most people will cite his acclaimed collaborations with Belgian designer Raf Simons \u2014 who attended the debut show, as did Virgil Abloh and a who\u2019s who of the art world \u2014 on numerous projects for Dior, Raf Simons and Calvin Klein. The kindred spirits first met back in 2005, when Raf visited Sterling\u2019s studio and bought one of his layered, volatile, ceramic pieces, which resemble coloured placentas. The pair became close and one of the most significant cross-disciplinary unions in fashion history was formed. It was an exchange that went beyond collaboration \u2014 it was a friendship, a creative brotherhood that saw Sterling bleach denim for Raf Simons\u2019s Tokyo store in the mid 00s; Raf reinterpret a Sterling triptych in his debut Dior couture collection in 2012; the co-designed and branded Raf Simons / Sterling Ruby autumn/ winter 14 collection; and Raf affording Sterling free creative reign to reimagine the Calvin Klein 205W39NYC flagship stores and show venues. Pieces from the duo\u2019s co-signed collection are considered to be among the most sought after pieces of the past decade. A limited edition, handpainted trench coat is currently on-sale at $50,000 on grailed.com. But throughout Sterling\u2019s personal practice, many of his works have integrated textile and quilted fabrics, further reflecting the artist\u2019s sincere interest in material\u2019s expressive potential.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of that Raf Simons / Sterling Ruby show, Sterling described how excited he was by the fashion system. \u201cEverybody was standing up, cheering. At that moment I thought, Fuck being an artist \u2014 this is wonderful.\u201d Five years after his self-realisation, we thought: fuck Sterling being just an artist, he\u2019s one of the fashion industry\u2019s most exciting talents too.\n\nIn a sense, Sterling has come full circle with S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA., as clothes-making was one of his first artistic pursuits. Over the course of the last decade he has continually returned to the spirit of his teenage wardrobe. \u201cI have to say that I\u2019ve almost reached a point where I only wear what I make,\u201d Sterling told us back in 2016, when his studio uniform experimentations were presented in Work Wear: Garment and Textile Archive 2008-2016 at Spr\u00fcth Magers\u2019s London gallery space. \u201cI still have some other clothes, plain Margiela sweatshirts, a bunch of Raf\u2019s pieces, of course, and Dries,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I would say 90 percent of what I wear is what we make in the studio.\u201d\n\nInitially, it was created almost as a uniform for his studio staff and assistants and he was drawn to this concept of the team being camouflaged in his craft. His early pieces mutated out of his sculptures and paintings, self-cannibalised from off cuts of the bleached and torched fabrics and canvas that made up his paintings, and the S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA. debut is a direct descendent of these workwear experiments.\n\nLike much of his autobiographical artwork, S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA. probes the American dream (and nightmare). It has opened up his private world and wardrobe and encouraged us all to dress in his hopes and fears and realities. Two of the tunic dresses featured images shot by Sterling\u2019s wife, Melanie Schiff. A vinyl tabard showcased the cover of a book called Hex, which is about the Pennsylvania Dutch community from which he comes. US flag decals appeared on denim.\n\nThis powerful collage of Sterling\u2019s past, present and future was amplified with a casting made up his friends and family, including the actress Mackenzie Davis and her partner, the artist and former studio staff member Augustus Thompson. Designer and curator Clemande Burgevin Blachman, studio staff member Sonja Bartlett and Raf Simons\u2019s longstanding right-hand man, Pieter Mulier. \u201cIn doing a show for the very first time, I wanted to preserve the intimacy of where it came from,\u201d Sterling says. \u201cIt meant a lot to me to have friends and family around for Pitti, to really be a part of the entire experience, from the backstage to the runway.\u201d\n\n\u201cSterling is a family guy,\u201d model Sonja Bartlett told us after walking the show. \u201cHe runs his studio like a family business.\u201d Like so many of the people who work with him, Sonja has been at the studio for several years and it was important for Sterling to have his nearest and dearest around him as he turned the page on to a new creative chapter.\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend is Tyler [Britt], Sterling\u2019s studio director, so I\u2019m a relatively new member of the family, but the way everyone has brought me in has been incredible and it\u2019s made this experience so wonderful,\u201d the actress Sonja Maura tells us. \u201cHis clothes make me feel ready to work, elegantly,\u201d Sonja Bartlett adds. \u201cI feel hot and strong,\u201d Sonja Maura counters as she points out the theme of feminine strength that runs throughout the women\u2019s pieces. \u201cThere are so many different characters and moods explored in the collection and my look feels like an old C\u00e9line Morticia Addams look, so it made me stand up straight and feel powerful,\u201d actress Mackenzie Davis adds with a smile.\n\nReacting to fashion\u2019s practical production demands, S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA. is split into four collections: the main line; ED 50 which is a rotating selection of limited-edition pieces made in quantities of 50; SOTO which encompass garments made from fabric handworked by Ruby\u2019s studio; and UNIQUE, one of a kind pieces designed by Ruby. The handworked denim crafted from specialised fabrics and activated by the elements, graphic T-shirts featuring limited edition heat transfer prints and one-of-a-kind collages created by Ruby and sewn in his Los Angeles studio that make up the main line were available to buy the day after the show, exclusively on SSENSE. \u201cIn many respects, outside of the logistics of putting together the collection and the garments themselves, I don\u2019t see garment creation as any different to making a sculpture or painting,\u201d Sterling explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s fun to think of something going out into the world, and moving, and being something for people to see.\"\n\nCredits\n\nPhotography Willy Vanderperre.\n\nStyling Alastair McKimm.\n\n\n\nHair Anthony Turner at Streeters.\n\nMake-up Lynsey Alexander at Streeters using Lanc\u00f4me.\n\nNail technician Ama Quashie at Streeters using CHANEL\n\nLe Vernis Pure Black and CHANEL La Cr\u00e8me Main.\n\nSet design Emma Roach at Streeters.\n\nPhotography assistance Romain Dubus, George Eyres, Tomo Inenaga and Louiws Headlam.\n\nDigital technician Henri Coutant.\n\nStyling assistance Madison Matusich.\n\nHair assistance Claire Grech.\n\nMake-up assistance Phoebe Brown.\n\nSet design assistance Nia Samuel Johnson.\n\nProduction Ragi Dholakia Productions.\n\nProduction assistance Claire Huish, May Powell, Nina Parsons and Louis Courts.\n\nCasting director Samuel Ellis Scheinman for DMCASTING.\n\n\n\nModel Mica Arga\u00f1araz at DNA.\n\n\n\nALL CLOTHING S.R.
