Proposition C would permit sales to adults.\n\nAlthough the measure remains on November\u2019s ballot, the Yes on Proposition C campaign says it won\u2019t be continuing its support efforts.\n\nJuul says its decision was part of a companywide review from newly appointed CEO K.C. Crosthwaite. It came as the company is under investigation into concerns about its advertising.\n\nThe announcement also came as a 14th U.S. death related to vaping was reported in Nebraska.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Juul Labs says it will stop supporting a ballot measure to overturn an anti-vaping law in San Francisco, effectively killing the campaign.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
