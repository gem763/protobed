It wasn\u2019t the first time.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cThe call appeared to be one of the most unfortunate of faux pas: what is known, in casual parlance, as a butt dial,\u201d Schapiro wrote in an NBC News account of the Oct. 16 voice message.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even the first. Just a few weeks earlier, Schapiro wrote, Giuliani had left him a voice mail in which he could be heard making corruption claims about former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe initial butt dial came in at 3:37 p.m. on Sept. 28. A day earlier, Schapiro had spoken to Giuliani for a story that quoted several of the attorney\u2019s former Justice Department colleagues saying they thought he had broken the law in pressing for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nIn the message, Giuliani repeated familiar, unfounded allegations against the Bidens, Schapiro wrote. He claimed that Joe Biden had been \u201ctrading in on his public office\u201d and that his son had done the same. He said the former vice president had halted the investigation of a Ukrainian gas company because Hunter Biden was on its board.\n\nGiuliani also said he was being attacked because of his public accusations against the Biden family.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI expected it would happen,\u201d he said, according to NBC. \u201cThe minute you touch on one of the protected people, they go crazy. They come after you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEighteen days later, Schapiro got the second apparently accidental Giuliani voice mail. The call was made at 11:07 p.m. on Oct. 16, hours after Schapiro and Giuliani spoke for an article about Giuliani\u2019s connection to an Iranian dissident group.\n\nSchapiro was asleep when he missed Giuliani\u2019s call. Listening to it the next morning, the reporter struggled to follow what Giuliani was talking about.\n\n\u201cYou know, Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn\u2019t do any due diligence,\u201d he said at the start. Then, he said, \u201cI gotta get you to get on Bahrain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShortly after that, Giuliani asked if \u201cRobert\u201d was around. A man replied that he was in Turkey. Giuliani responded, \u201cThe problem is we need some money\u201d and then added, \u201cWe need a few hundred thousand.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the call was difficult to make out, Schapiro wrote. He said during an appearance on MSNBC that he had \u201cno idea what he\u2019s talking about with regard to Charles and Bahrain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe recording is muffled so it\u2019s difficult to discern exactly what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d Schapiro said on MSNBC. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly intriguing, and I can tell you I did not go to sleep that night expecting to wake up that morning with a three-minute voice mail from Rudolph W. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe reached out to Giuliani afterward, he said, but had \u201cyet to receive an intentional or an unintentional call back.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has not returned calls from The Post, either, as of late \u2014 although Post reporters, too, have received the occasional butt dial from him.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The NBC reporter reached out to Giuliani afterward, he said, but had \u201cyet to receive an intentional or an unintentional call back.\u201d", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gb_mMHmG1h_JmudiEXZae8w4S9M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5WDSYYXSSEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
