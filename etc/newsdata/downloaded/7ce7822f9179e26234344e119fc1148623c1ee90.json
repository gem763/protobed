Presidential proclamations can move markets, rattle world capitals and, in this case, unnecessarily alarm the residents of a state. Trump\u2019s relationship with the truth and accountability threatened to, yet again, diminish the weight of any president\u2019s words\u2026\n\nTrump has owned up to a few mistakes: He apologized, once, for the Access Hollywood tape that captured him boasting about groping women \u2014 though he later mused that the audio might be fake. And the mistakes he has made in office were, by his account, the appointments of officials who have let him down, like Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nHis attitude is no joke to those who worry about the potential consequences when the matter is far more grave than a weather map.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution, with its checks and balances, was drafted on the intellectual foundation that we all make mistakes all the time: a president does, Congress does, the courts do, the people do,\u201d said Meacham. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that more harm hasn\u2019t come of it. It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so serious.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
