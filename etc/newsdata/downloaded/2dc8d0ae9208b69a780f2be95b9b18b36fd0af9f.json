[with] no suggestion of any change ... in the immediate future,' said Mr Stratton SC.\n\nHe asked the three judges to give weight to the matters that Justice Geoffrey Bellew 'did not give sufficient regard' to in the original sentencing.\n\nMr Stratton told the court that Khalid's lack of criminal record at the time of sentencing and his minimal breaches since being in prison should be taken into account.\n\nKhalid's solicitor Stephen Alexander said in an affidavit filed to the court that his client was unable to access educational resources despite his expressed interest to.\n\nIn 2017 when Justice Bellew sentenced Khalid he said: 'He was a devout terrorist ... corrupted by a dangerous, violent and perverted ideology to which he unequivocally subscribed, which he wore as a badge of honour, but which has no place in any civilised society'\n\nDavid Jordan, who represented The Crown, said while Khalid never committed the offences there was 'not a lot of difference' between his case and Raban Alou, who was sentenced to 33 years for his role in the death of Curtis Cheng.\n\nHe said that Khalid also was in a position of leadership among the conspirators.\n\nIn 2017 when Justice Bellew sentenced Khalid he said: 'He was a devout terrorist ... corrupted by a dangerous, violent and perverted ideology to which he unequivocally subscribed, which he wore as a badge of honour, but which has no place in any civilised society'.\n\nOne of the three judges hearing the appeal - Justice Harrison - said it was 'a bit hard to get away from the fact the conditions of incarceration are fairly harsh'.\n\nThe NSW Court of Criminal Appeal has reserved its decision in the matter.", "description": "Sulayman Khalid was sentenced to 22 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiring to commit a terror attack in 2014.
