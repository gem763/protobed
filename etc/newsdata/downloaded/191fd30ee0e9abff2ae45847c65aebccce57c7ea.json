A little over a month ago (although it seems like much longer) he told a rally that \u201cyou have no choice but to vote for me,\u201d because his electoral defeat would lead to a market crash.\n\nBut a funny thing has happened over the course of Trump\u2019s latest terrible, horrible, very bad, no good two weeks. Suddenly, impeachment (though not removal from office) has gone from highly unlikely to highly likely. In fact, given the explosive nature of the now-revealed whistle-blower complaint, I don\u2019t really understand how he can not be impeached.\n\nAnd the financial markets have basically shrugged.\n\nOn the surface, this may seem strange. After all, whatever the eventual outcome of the surging prospect of impeachment, the immediate effect is surely to cripple the Trump administration\u2019s ability to pursue its legislative agenda. Why doesn\u2019t this worry investors?\n\nThe answer is, \u201cWhat legislative agenda?\u201d\n\nEven when Trump\u2019s party controlled both houses of Congress, he had only two major legislative initiatives. One was a big tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that will generate trillions in deficits but doesn\u2019t seem to have done much for the economy. The other was an attempt to take away health insurance from around 30 million Americans, which didn\u2019t pass.", "description": "It will slow down the administration\u2019s war on competence.", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/opinion/26krugmanWeb/26krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
