No mechanism exists to hold city officials accountable, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for somebody else to take control,\u201d Tatum said.\n\nTatum and others sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to determine whether there has been \u201ca continued pattern and practice of using excessive force\u201d against minorities in Fort Worth.\n\nOfficer Aaron Dean, 34, resigned and was arrested Monday for firing a single bullet through a windowpane while investigating a neighbor\u2019s report about the front door being open at Jefferson\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cThe only alternative to prevent future unlawful killings,\u201d the coalition letter said, \u201cis to place the city under a federal consent decree.\u201d\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price Wednesday reiterated the city\u2019s commitment to addressing concerns. She said in a statement, \u201cMy focus remains on healing this city and pushing forward to see that we make progress.\u201d\n\nShe said actions currently underway include engaging national experts to review procedures within the police department, with an independent third-party panel being on board by Nov. 19. She said they\u2019ll continue to implement recommendations from a race and culture task force, including hiring an independent police monitor and diversity officer.\n\nThe Department of Justice conducted civil rights investigations of nearly 70 police departments between 1994, when Congress authorized them, and the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. But the agency\u2019s current policy, established by then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, pulled back on previous administrations\u2019 embrace of long-lasting, in-depth federal investigations of police followed by reform plans supervised by federal judges.\n\nHours before he resigned as attorney general in November 2018, Sessions signed a memo providing guidance to staff that portrayed consent decrees as having been too sweeping, too open-ended and too much of a strain on city budgets. The guidance doesn\u2019t explicitly rule out consent decrees but sharply limits situations in which the Justice Department would pursue them.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department have done very, very few investigations (under Trump),\u201d said Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department attorney. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure it won\u2019t open an investigation against Fort Worth \u2014 but it seems unlikely.\u201d\n\nCommunities bent on overhauling their police forces through court-monitored plans don\u2019t necessarily have to involve the Justice Department.\n\nChicago, which has had a long reputation for police brutality against minorities, is a case in point.\n\nAfter more than a yearlong investigation, a damning report released in the waning days of the Obama administration in January 2017 found that deep-rooted civil rights abuses permeated Chicago\u2019s more than 13,000-member force.\n\nOver several months, then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration negotiated a draft plan with Trump\u2019s Department of Justice that foresaw no court role. Community groups and civil rights leaders called the plan toothless.\n\nAmid that criticism, then-Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan \u2014 with Emanuel\u2019s agreement \u2014 sued the city in 2017 to ensure a judge would have oversight. The move cut the Justice Department out of the process.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the Trump administration from seeking to scuttle the deal. The Justice Department filed a court document opposing the plan, saying it would deprive officers of flexibility to do their jobs right. A judge nonetheless approved the agreement.\n\nThe option of bypassing the Justice Department may not be politically viable for Fort Worth, said Smith. Illinois\u2019 attorney general, a Democrat, was sympathetic to the idea of a consent decree, but the GOP attorney general in Texas most likely would not be, he said.\n\nCommunity groups could attempt to sue with the aim of getting the city into federal court. But they would have a harder time establishing that they have legal standing to sue a city, Smith said.\n\n___\n\nAP Legal Affairs Writer Tarm reported from Chicago and writer Michael Balsamo contributed from Washington.", "description": "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Community and faith leaders on Wednesday called on the Trump administration to open a civil rights investigation into the Fort", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/7a5a67_police-shooting-in-home-texas-82095-pastor-kyev-tatum-speaks-news-conference-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
