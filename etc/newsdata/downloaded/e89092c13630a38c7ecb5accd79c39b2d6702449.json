There is cohesion in the writing because the person understands the language better than any learnt language.\u201d\n\nThe event featured poetry reading and those who attended were taken on a tour of the heritage site. The museum\u2019s gallery was also officially opened.", "description": "IN CELEBRATION of Heritage Day, the Kwa\u00adZulu-Natal Museum hosted an event to celebrate South Africa\u2019s literary classics in the year of indigenous languages on Friday, September 20 at the KZN Museum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9398/15011f319ad949d2944cd71767de622f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
