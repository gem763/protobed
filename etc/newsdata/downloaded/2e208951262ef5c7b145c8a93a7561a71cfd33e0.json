He declared a, quote, big success there claiming people are congratulating him and celebrating the great outcome, but just as he was there claiming victory his own special envoy to Syria was telling congress a very different story. Our chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz joins us now with more from Washington. Good morning, Martha. Reporter: Good morning, the president is trying to change the narrative in what is widely seen as a foreign policy blunder with hundreds of dead and wounded, as many as 200,000 displaced and ISIS fighters on the run. This morning, the fighting in northern Syria has all but stopped. With Russian forces now patrolling alongside Turkish forces and the kurds left with no choice but to retreat after the U.S. Abandoned the former partners. Turkey, Syria and all forms of the kurds have been fighting for centuries and now we're getting out. Reporter: It was trump's abrupt withdrawal of American forces which essentially gave Turkey the green light to invade. Trump's own envoy to the region on capitol hill Wednesday calling Turkey's decision a tragedy. The Turkish government made a terribly bad and very, very dangerous decision. Reporter: A move that could put Americans in the crosshairs once again with ISIS prisoners now on the loose. We would say that the number is now over 100. We do not know where they are. Reporter: But president trump claiming the number is far less and downplaying the danger. There were a few that got out, a small number, relatively speaking, and they've been largely recaptured. Reporter: And those Turkish forces and the militias they support trump's newly appointed secretary of defense says he is disturbed by reports of violence from the battlefield that could be seen as war crimes. I've seen reports as well. We're trying to monitor them. They are horrible and if accurate and I assume they are accurate they would be war crimes. Reporter: The president says the American troop withdrawal is part of his promise to get out of endless wars, but those 1,000 Americans in Syria who were withdrawn without warning were there to help the kurds fight ISIS. Thank you so much, Martha.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Ambassador James Jeffrey  described to Congress the mess that has enveloped the region since President Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191024_gma_raddatz1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
