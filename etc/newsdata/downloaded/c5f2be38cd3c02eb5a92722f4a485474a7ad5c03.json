Dunn\u2019s parents have been urging the UK government either to challenge that claim or to put more pressure on the US to waive immunity.\n\nThis would allow her to return to the UK to face questioning by Northamptonshire police over the incident. A Volvo car allegedly driven by Sacoolas struck Dunn after leaving RAF Croughton.\n\nThe Downing Street spokesman said that Trump was aware of the case and expressed his condolences to Dunn\u2019s parents in his call with Johnson. \u201cThe leaders agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible,\u201d he said. Later, in his comments to reporters, Trump said it sometimes \u201chappens\u201d that Americans drive on the wrong side of the road in the UK. \u201cIt was an accident. It was a terrible accident,\u201d he said. It is unclear at this stage what caused the collision.\n\nRaab met Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, and his father, Tim Dunn, on Wednesday afternoon after having talks with the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, on Tuesday.\n\nCharles told reporters afterwards: \u201cI can\u2019t really see the point as to why we were invited to see Dominic Raab. We are no further forward than where we were this time last week. Part of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK government side to show they are trying to help. But, although he is engaging with us, we have no answers. We are really frustrated that we could spend half an hour or more with him and just come out with nothing.\u201d\n\nRadd Seiger, the spokesman for the family, said of the meeting: \u201cTo say we are disappointed with the outcome is an understatement.\u201d Accusing Raab of being cold in the meeting, he said that following conversations with lawyers expert in the field of diplomatic immunity, it was not right to suggest her claim of diplomatic immunity was not open to challenge.\n\nHe said the law on immunity was outmoded and understood by only a handful of experts. The family felt let down by Raab simply repeating the US assertion that it never allowed waivers on diplomatic immunity, he said.\n\nSeiger said the family did not know much about the law around diplomatic immunity. \u201cThis is a complicated area of law with outdated laws, and many lawyers struggle to understand. The parents don\u2019t know the law. They do not understand much of this, but this a right/wrong situation.\u201d\n\nRaab insisted he shared \u201cthe frustration of Harry\u2019s mother and father\u201d. The foreign secretary added: \u201cThey have lost their son and the justice process is not being allowed to properly run its course.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to press the US authorities for their cooperation to ensure the police can pursue this case unimpeded and to allow Harry\u2019s family to get justice.\n\n\u201cWe will use every avenue and opportunity open to us to try to right the wrong and allow the justice system to follow its course.\u201d\n\nRaab has also spoken by phone to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, as well as the US ambassador. The Foreign Office said it was in no doubt that Sacoolas\u2019s family was covered by diplomatic immunity under the Vienna convention, and that it could not challenge that fact.", "description": "Parents of 19-year-old killed in collision to try to force Anne Sacoolas back for questioning", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d31634c3aa7089bc77c1f85d7bb3520a4597804/376_86_4907_2945/master/4907.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cdc399cc17a5fba07638a5e98eb240d9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
