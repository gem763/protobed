That\u2019s not just a political complaint either. It was the very first legal claim made in the letter sent to Pelosi a few weeks ago by White House counsel Pat Cipollone:\n\nThat issue was before a federal district court this week in connection with Democrats\u2019 demand for access to the redacted grand jury material in the Mueller report. The law says that grand jury material must be provided when it\u2019s relevant to a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d But that\u2019s Cipolline\u2019s, and the DOJ\u2019s, point \u2014 there\u2019s no \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d in the House because they\u2019ve never gotten around to formally initiating one. That forced Judge Beryl Howell to take up the question of whether an impeachment inquiry that hasn\u2019t officially commenced with a House vote can be said to exist.\n\nAnswer: Yes. The key section runs from pages 49 to 62 of the opinion. Howell notes that the House has in fact impeached *judges* before without formally opening an impeachment inquiry with a floor vote, but the thrust of her argument is simply deference to the House on a matter where the Constitution gives it exclusive power. That deference isn\u2019t unlimited \u2014 the court can and will scrutinize whether the House, in demanding grand jury material, really does want that material for an investigation whose \u201cprimary purpose\u201d is judicial, i.e. impeachment. But if the House clears that bar, which it did in this case, the court isn\u2019t going to tell it how to run its shop by voting on an official resolution to open an impeachment probe. Especially not based on something as gassy as tradition:\n\nHowell emphasizes deference to the legislature again later:\n\nThe ruling can be and will be appealed, of course, but I\u2019m skeptical that a 5-4 conservative majority led by John Roberts will start dictating procedural steps to Pelosi on a matter as glaringly political as impeachment. The other four conservatives might be willing to, but there are two ultra-high-profile examples in Roberts\u2019s past of him allegedly changing his vote to side with the liberals in cases that had drawn intense political interest. Roberts reportedly is anxious that the Court not come to be seen as just another partisan operation; the Trump era, with POTUS complaining about \u201cObama judges\u201d vis-a-vis \u201cTrump judges,\u201d must have only intensified that anxiety. It\u2019s all but impossible to imagine Roberts casting a decisive vote for the Republican in a showdown over whether the Democratic impeachment process is constitutional or not, knowing that that decision will be demagogued as Republican justices covering for Trump. I\u2019d bet on Howell\u2019s ruling to stand, at least in its bottom-line holding that the House gets wide latitude on how to conduct impeachment.\n\nI might even bet that the vote will be more lopsided than 5-4.\n\nExit question: What sort of bombshell would need to be lurking in the Mueller grand jury material for Democrats to add something related to Russiagate to the articles of impeachment? Pelosi has reportedly been adamant behind closed doors that impeachment should focus laser-like on the Ukraine matter. The further it strays from that subject, the more the public will lose sight of what Trump is accused of and the easier it\u2019ll be for Republicans to accuse Dems of kitchen-sinking all of their grievances with the president via impeachment. I think they\u2019re going to stay away from Russia stuff unless there\u2019s something truly explosive in the Mueller stuff \u2014 explosive enough that it\u2019s actually more incriminating than the Ukraine matter.", "description": "Deference.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/m-9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
