REUTERS/David Mdzinarishvili/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The parent of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts was sued on Thursday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused the chain of failing to protect hundreds of thousands of customers whose accounts were targeted in a series of \u201cbrute force\u201d cyberattacks.\n\nJames said Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc did nothing in 2015 to protect 19,715 customers whose accounts had been targeted in a single five-day period, after learning about the problem from its own app developer.\n\nShe said the Canton, Massachusetts-based company failed to notify affected customers of the breaches, reset their passwords or freeze their Dunkin\u2019 Donuts cards.\n\nJames also said Dunkin\u2019 failed to adopt appropriate safeguards to limit future attacks, despite customer reports of continuing fraud on their accounts.\n\nThat failure came to roost in late 2018 when more than 300,000 customer accounts were accessed in new attacks, James said in the lawsuit, which concerns accounts created through Dunkin\u2019s website or free mobile app.\n\n\u201cDunkin\u2019 failed to protect the security of its customers,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cDunkin\u2019 sat idly by, putting customers at risk.\u201d\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit filed in a New York state court in Manhattan seeks civil fines, restitution and other remedies for alleged violations of state consumer protection and business laws.\n\n\u201cDunkin\u2019s representation to consumers that it used reasonable safeguards to protect consumers\u2019 personal information, and the company\u2019s statements concerning the 2018 breach, were false and misleading,\u201d the complaint said.", "description": "The parent of Dunkin' Donuts was sued on Thursday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused the chain of failing to protect hundreds of thousands of customers whose accounts were targeted in a series of \"brute force\" cyberattacks.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434234962&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1OT-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
