We were preparing the 9 a.m. hour of \u201cFox News Live,\u201d as we called it then. I was to interview the author of a new book about the death penalty, as well as a musician launching a comeback tour.\n\nThen came the unthinkable.\n\nA STORY OF A FAITH TRANSFORMED IN THE MIDST OF THE 9/11 TERROR ATTACKS\n\nThe darkest rages of the human heart blotted out the bright September sun, first in New York City, then Washington, D.C., and finally in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nIt was a little before nine that morning. I was opening the door to Studio E, already wearing the communications pack that allows colleagues in the control room to communicate through my earpiece. My producer\u2019s voice suddenly shattered what had been a mundane Tuesday morning: \u201cJon Scott, get to the studio\u2014NOW!!!\u201d\n\nI told him I was already there and asked what was up. \u201cA plane just flew into the World Trade Center!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFox & Friends\u201d team was already covering the story, what little we knew of it, but even though the North Tower was burning just a few miles south of our building, no media outlets had a video feed yet.\n\nThe anchors could only talk about the news flashes coming into their laptops: that a \u201csmall plane\u201d had hit the World Trade Center and that the upper floors of the building were on fire.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fighting with one another after 9/11. We weren\u2019t carping over little things. We weren\u2019t Republicans and Democrats\u2014we were Americans.\n\nWithin moments, a news chopper arrived and began beaming a live video feed. \u201cFox & Friends\u201d ended their program early, about five minutes before nine, and handed off to my team and me.\n\nIt would be the worst day to be in the news business. It would be the worst day any of us had ever seen.\n\nThe unimaginable happened. And it all unfolded on live television. Madmen deliberately flew jetliners loaded with people into office buildings\u2014before that day, who could have imagined such depravity?\n\nI certainly couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn the early minutes of our coverage, my team connected me by phone with a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator who\u2019d handled many air crash investigations. How, I asked him, on a bright blue-sky day, could a pilot have flown into the World Trade Center?\n\nThe idea that it was deliberate seemed unthinkable. He began to answer, explaining that pilots could have been blinded by the sun, distracted by workload or maybe punched the wrong coordinates into their flight computers\u2026.\n\nThen came the real answer. A second jet swooped ominously low in the bottom right corner of the TV monitor I was watching as I spoke to the former-NTSB guest. It briefly disappeared behind the \u201cbanner\u201d at the bottom of the screen. The helicopter providing the TV image was slowly circling the Trade Center, and at that moment, the two buildings were in perfect alignment so that the south tower was hidden behind the north. Suddenly, the huge fireball erupted from somewhere behind the north tower, but I couldn\u2019t see where.\n\nMy mind couldn\u2019t process the evils we all were seeing. For a split second, I thought our director had somehow located a video recording of the first strike on the north tower and was replaying it.\n\nThe helicopter continued its slow, sad circle.\n\nThe south tower came into view, its shattered fa\u00e7ade now belching horrifying flame and smoke into the blue sky while pieces of the building and its contents fluttered to earth, glittering in the September sunshine.\n\nI cut off the interview with the NTSB expert.\n\n\u201cThis has to be deliberate, folks,\u201d I said. And then, my voice shaking with emotion, swallowing hard to try to maintain composure, I spoke the name of the only suspect I could think of who might have planned something so horrifying: \u201cUsama bin Laden.\u201d\n\nI was about to write that \u201cyou know what happened from that point on\u2026\u201d but it\u2019s not entirely true.\n\nThat horrific morning is now 18 years behind us; there is now a generation of Americans who didn\u2019t watch it unfold on live television.\n\nThey don\u2019t have the memories that seared the mind as we watched them, together.\n\nHuge jetliners and their terrified passengers, obliterated in an instant.\n\nOffice workers leaning out broken windows, desperately gasping for the crisp September air that still wafted outside their 110-story hell. Some of them ultimately jumping, a few even holding hands as they leapt together, choosing a quick end over slow immolation.\n\nThat is why we at Fox do not randomly run images of that day. The events of 9/11 cannot, should not, be reduced to what\u2019s become known as \u201cwallpaper video.\u201d\n\nNearly 3,000 of our mothers, brothers, fathers, sisters, sons and daughters went to work or boarded planes that morning\u2026 and never came home.\n\nFirefighters, police officers and everyday citizens gave their own lives trying to save others.\n\nThe worst impulses of the human heart were met with their uplifting counterpart; confronted with evils like we have never seen, Americans responded with courage, love\u2014and sacrifice.\n\nRemember, if you can, the immediate aftermath.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fighting with one another after 9/11. We weren\u2019t carping over little things. We weren\u2019t Republicans and Democrats\u2014we were Americans.\n\nWe had work to do, and we joined hands together to get it done.\n\nI recall saying something on air late that day about how the terrorists had knocked a few buildings down, but that America would pick herself up, dust herself off and come back strong.\n\nMy hope and my prayer, as we mark another 9/11, is that the memories of that awful day will spark in us a renewal of the spirit that came after it, that we treat each other with the kindness, respect and even love that we all saw in the aftermath of the attacks in 2001.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe world was watching as America was attacked, and America responded with strength and determination. But--in the less than two decades since, the civility of our discourse and the regard we shared for one another after that terror attack on our nation has largely disappeared.\n\nSo on 9/11, watch the terrible video. Remember that day, if you lived it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, watch the images that we ONLY replay on this day and try to comprehend how frightening, how painful, how terrible it truly was, and resolve to remember the victims through acts of kindness and compassion.\n\nThe terrorists tried to bring down the United States of America that day. Eighteen years later, let\u2019s not let them win.", "description": "My producer\u2019s voice suddenly shattered what had been a mundane Tuesday morning: \u201cJon Scott, get to the studio\u2014NOW!!!\u201d", "authors": ["Jon Scott", "Jon Scott Currently Serves As The Anchor Of"], "top_image": "https://video.foxnews.com/thumbnails/090911/640/360/090911_edge_911happened_640.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
