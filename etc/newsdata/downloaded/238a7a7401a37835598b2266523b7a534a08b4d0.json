Some Fox hosts and guests have even warned of a \u201ccoup,\u201d extreme rhetoric that has been embraced by the president.\n\nBut as Fox vows to cover impeachment in a rigorous and fair-minded way in its news programming, if not opinion shows, the network is becoming a kind of Rorschach test for cracks in the president\u2019s media firewall. The calculus is simple: If Fox starts allowing more anti-Trump conservatives to voice concerns about the president\u2019s behavior, it clears the way for conservative House members and senators to express doubts of their own without having to worry about a conservative media backlash.\n\nJoe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and radio host now running a long-shot primary bid against Trump, told POLITICO that current members look to Fox News for signs of what\u2019s acceptable conservative dialogue.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t fear Trump. They fear his voters,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThey know his voters digest Fox News every day, so they toe the line with what Fox News is doing [and] put out crap about the \u2018deep state\u2019 and all this other stuff they really don\u2019t believe in.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
