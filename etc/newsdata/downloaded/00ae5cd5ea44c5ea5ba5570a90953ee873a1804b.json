She soon built that studio, adding to her triumphs. Cinema was Blache\u2019s passion \u2013 she called it her Prince Charming \u2013 and it took her across continents and centuries in a life shaped both by soaring achievements and by some of the same struggles that women filmmakers face today.\n\nShe was aware of her singularity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI have produced some of the biggest productions ever released by a motion picture company,\u201d Blache told the entertainment weekly The New York Clipper in 1912. \u201cI am the only woman who is directing companies before the camera.\u201d\n\nShe made \u2013 directed, produced or supervised (often doing triple duty) \u2013 about 1,000 films, many of them short, the standard at the time.\n\nShe would later leave the industry at a time when her life was marred by personal and professional disappointments, then spend years trying to claim her place in the very history that she had helped make.\n\nLike other trailblazing women from cinema\u2019s formative years, Blache has been discovered, somehow overlooked and rediscovered anew. Only now, largely because of the feminist film scholars who are writing women back into history, does her place seem secure.\n\nBlache got her start in films when she was 22 and working as a secretary in Paris for Leon Gaumont, an inventor who had begun manufacturing motion picture cameras. To demonstrate them to clients, his company made short films that Blache thought could be better.\n\n\u201cI had read a good deal,\u201d she wrote in The Memoirs of Alice Guy Blache, which was ushered into publication posthumously in 1976 by historian Anthony Slide. And she had done some \u201camateur theatricals\u201d.\n\nShe asked Gaumont if she could film a few scenes.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a silly, girlish thing to do,\u201d Gaumont told her, Blache recalled many decades later in a French television interview, \u201cbut you can try if you want. On one condition: that your office work does not suffer.\u201d\n\nArmed with a cameraman, an actress and a painted backdrop, she made La Fee aux Choux (The Cabbage Fairy) in 1896, her first film. A pantomimed one-minute charmer, it shows a young woman who, with a smile and a bosom wreathed in flowers, plucks squalling naked babies from a cabbage patch constructed out of wood. Some historians believe that Blache\u2019s inaugural effort was Sage-Femme de Premiere Classe (First Class Midwife), her 1902 remake about a young couple who go shopping for a baby. (Blache played the husband.)\n\nGaumont soon made Blache the head of film production at his company, where she produced and supervised hundreds of films, helped create an organised studio system years before Hollywood was a company town and trained luminaries of the art like Louis Feuillade. When she moved to the United States, where she resumed her film career, her time at Gaumont was touted in profiles. In 1912, the trade journal The Movie Picture World, wrote: \u201cShe inaugurated the presentation of little plays on the screen by that company some 16 or 17 years ago.\u201d\n\nAlice Ida Antoinette Guy was born in Saint-Mande, on the eastern edge of Paris, on 1 July 1873. Her parents, Marie and Emile Guy, were French but lived in Chile, where her father was a bookseller; her mother returned to France for Blache\u2019s birth and then left the child with a grandmother. Three years later, her mother returned for Blache, and they sailed to Chile. While passing through the Strait of Magellan, near Chile\u2019s southern tip, as she recalled in her memoir, she conjured up fairies and beasts on walls of ice \u2013 an early, whimsical prelude to her screen reveries.\n\nAssorted tragedies in Chile followed, and the Guys eventually returned to France, but over time the family disintegrated, leaving Blache to support her mother.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 20 directors who hate their own films Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 20 directors who hate their own films 1/20 American History X \u2013 Tony Kaye There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye. Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters \u2013 published by the trade press \u2013 telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. \u201cI had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,\u201d Kaye wrote in The Guardian, three years after the release. \u201cOne was \u2018Humpty Dumpty\u2019. Another was \u2018Ralph Coates\u2019, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.\u201d The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since. 2/20 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen \u2013 Michael Bay The first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there\u2019s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. \"When I look back at it, that was crap,\u201d he said of the film in 2011. \u201cThe writers' strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you've got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It's a BS way to make a movie.\u201d 3/20 The Snowman \u2013 Tomas Alfredson While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. \u201cOur shoot time in Norway was way too short,\u201d he explained following the film\u2019s release. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.\u201d Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don\u2019t see the whole picture,\u201d he added. 4/20 Avengers: Age of Ultron \u2013 Joss Whedon Joss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (\u00a31.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn\u2019t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: \u201cI\u2019m tied and I had a terrible time.\u201d A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. \u201cI was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.\u201d Whedon added that he remains \u201cproud\u201d of the film, yet there are still things about the film that \u201cfrustrate\u201d him hugely. 5/20 Annie Hall, Hannah And Her Sisters, Manhattan \u2013 Woody Allen Annie Hall is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Hannah And Her Sisters won an Oscar for best screenplay. Manhattan is often heralded as a comedy masterpiece. Woody Allen, though, believes his other films are better. \u201cFor some reason [Annie Hall] is very likeable. I\u2019ve made better films than that. Match Point is a better film, Purple Rose of Cairo is a better film, the French one \u2013 Midnight in Paris \u2013 is a better film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is as good. I mean, I\u2019ve made films that were as good, but for some reason that\u2019s got some charismatic, inexplicable hold on people. That and Manhattan too. [On] Manhattan, I missed what I was going for. Same thing with Hannah and Her Sisters. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a terrible film or a bad \u2013 I\u2019m not here to knock my films. But for me personally, I missed. It was too treacly at the end, too bailed-out.\u201d 6/20 Highball \u2013 Noah Baumbach Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer\u2019s one to Jesse Carter. \u201cIt was just too ambitious,\u201d he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. \u201cWe didn't have enough time, we didn't finish it, it didn't look good, it was just a whole ... mess. We couldn't get it done, and I had a falling out with the producer. He abandoned it, and I had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. Then later, it was put out on DVD without my approval.\u201d 7/20 Babylon AD \u2013 Mathieu Kassovitz Before Babylon AD \u2013 a futuristic sci-fi flick about a mercenary who has to escort a woman from Russia to America \u2013 reached cinemas in the UK, the director, Mathieu Kassovitz, was trying to distance himself from the Vin Diesel-led project. \"The movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the action scenes had a goal: they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters... instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24.\" Kassovitz later added the film was \"pure violence and stupidity\". 8/20 Catchfire \u2013 Dennis Hopper In 1992, Dennis Hopper joined the ranks of directors who released their film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee (famously used when filmmakers disown their own film). Originally called Catchfire, the Jodie Foster-starring thriller about a woman who enters witness protection was later retitled Backtrack, and 20 minutes were cut for the straight-to-VHS release. Hopper rarely spoke about the film; he wanted to distance himself as much as possible from the doomed project. 9/20 The Underneath \u2013 Steven Soderbergh \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful film to look at and I think the score is beautiful,\u201d Steven Soderberg said of The Underneath, \u201cbut 15 seconds in I know we\u2019re in trouble because of how f***ing long it takes to get through those opening credits. That\u2019s just an indication of what\u2019s wrong with this thing: it\u2019s just totally sleepy.\u201d The film, about a recovering gambling addict, was an unsurprising box-office flop. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019d recommend it to anyone,\u201d Soderbergh added, \u201cother than to look at in the context of someone\u2019s career\u201d. 10/20 Thor: The Dark World \u2013 Alan Taylor Alan Taylor \u2013 of Game of Thrones and Sopranos fame \u2013 seemed a perfect fit for Thor, the heroic God of Thunder who spoke in Shakespearean prose. When the sequel was released, many were disappointed with the film, which somehow wasted Christopher Eccleston, who played the villain. Taylor later criticised the project, saying: \u201cThe Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don\u2019t wish upon anybody else.\u201d Marvel 11/20 Fear and Desire \u2013 Stanley Kubrick Few filmmakers have spotless filmographies. Stanley Kubrick believed the blotch on his was Fear and Desire \u2013 the renowned-perfectionist\u2019s cinematic debut. As his stature as a director grew, Kubrick was said to grow ever-more disgruntled with Fear and Desire, an anti-war film about four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Reports emerged in the Sixties that Kubrick had destroyed the original negative print, and was hoping to destroy all leftover prints. In 1964, Kubrick called the film \u201ca serious effort, ineptly done\u201d. 12/20 Batman and Robin \u2013 Joel Schumacher Almost everyone involved with Batman & Robin seems to hate the final product. George Clooney has apologised for his Bat-nippled version of the Caped Crusader, while director Joel Schumacher has said sorry multiple times. \u201cLook, I apologise,\u201d he said in 2017. \u201cI want to apologise to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that.\u201d After the widely maligned film reached cinemas, Schumacher said he was treated like \u201cscum\u201d. \u201cIt was like I had murdered a baby,\u201d he continued. 13/20 The Day the Clown Cried \u2013 Jerry Lewis Jerry Lewis\u2019s The Day the Clown Cried has never been released. The director, who also starred as the leading character, locked the film \u2013 about a clown arrested in Nazi Germany for drunkenly defaming Hitler \u2013 in a private vault after completion. Lewis thought the film was so \u201cbad, bad, bad\u201d that he often refused to discuss the project, only commenting very occasionally. \"I was ashamed of the work and I was grateful I had the power to contain it all and never let anyone see it. It could have been wonderful but I slipped up \u2013 I didn't quite get it,\u201d he said in 2013. AFP 14/20 Fantastic Four \u2013 Josh Trank Everything was looking good for Fantastic Four before filming began. Some of Hollywood\u2019s most promising actors were playing the eponymous characters \u2013 Michael B Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell \u2013 while Josh Trank, coming off the back of runaway success Chronicle, was hired to direct. During post-production, though, everything fell apart. Trank was forced by the studio, Fox, to do extensive reshoots (you can tell which scenes were reshot because Mara\u2019s wig looks awful and Teller has varying lengths of stubble). The month before the film\u2019s release, the director spoke out on Twitter. \u201cA year ago I had a fantastic version of this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it would\u2019ve received great reviews. You\u2019ll probably never see it. That\u2019s reality though.\u201d The film bombed at the box office, with Trank\u2019s tweet reportedly costing Fox between $5m and $10m (\u00a33.8m and \u00a37.6m). 15/20 Woman Wanted \u2013 Kiefer Sutherland During the Nineties, Kiefer Sutherland wanted to progress from acting to directing. Although his feature-film debut as director, 1997\u2019s Truth or Consequences, was not exactly a critical success, he persevered, directing the 2000 flick Woman Wanted. Sutherland was so disappointed with the results, he released the film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee \u2013 becoming the last person to ever use the famed name. He has not directed a film since. 16/20 An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn \u2013 Alan Smithee/Arthur Hiller A film about the pseudonym Alan Smithee that ironically ended up being an Alan Smithee film. Arthur Hiller had no intention of disowning Burn Hollywood Burn, which aimed to lampoon the Hollywood system. The film centred on a director, named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle), who hands in a cut of a film, only for the studio to recut the entire thing. Life mirrored art as the studio behind Burn Hollywood Burn took the film away from Hiller, who ended up using the Smithee pseudonym on the release. 17/20 Dune \u2013 David Lynch Following the success of Oscar Best Picture winner The Elephant Man, David Lynch could have done almost anything. Despite having not read the book, Lynch agreed to adapt Dune, choosing the project over the third Star Wars, Return of the Jedi. Lynch soon started work on turning Frank Herbert\u2019s epic novel into a screenplay, turning in over five drafts. Yet, despite the preparation time, the final results were less than satisfactory for the director. \u201cI started selling out on Dune,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I probably shouldn't have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in.\u201d 18/20 Alien 3 \u2013 David Fincher David Fincher was just 28 years old when the producers of Alien decided to bring the upstart on board their second sequel. With just five weeks\u2019 preparation time, an unfinished script, and no real clout behind his name, Fincher struggled with the film. \u201cOh, it was just awful,\u201d he later said. \u201cThis is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d In 2009, promoting The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher elaborated: \u201cI had to work on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.\u201d 19/20 Hellraiser: Bloodline \u2013 Kevin Yagher The fourth film in the horror series Hellraiser had a troubled production. Original director Kevin Yagher was ordered by the studio to reshoot scenes, which he refused to do. Joe Chappelle stepped in, leading to Yagher demanding the Alan Smithee pseudonym be used. The final film \u2013 which acted as both a prequel and a sequel to the other three films \u2013 was not screened for critics, and was dismissed by many fans. 20/20 Accidental Love \u2013 David O Russell David O Russell began working on Nailed in 2008. Envisioning the film as a romantic comedy with political undertones, the director cast Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in leading roles, and was awarded $26 million (\u00a320 million) to make it. And still, somehow, the entire filming process was a mess. The set was shutdown a reported 14 times after cast and crew complained about not being paid. Eventually, after key scenes were not filmed during production, the entire thing was abandoned. After Russell started drawing Oscars attention for The Fighter and American Hustle, though, the studio wanted to get Nailed out in cinemas. Work continued on the film without Russell\u2019s involvement. The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director\u2019s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. 1/20 American History X \u2013 Tony Kaye There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye.

The month before the film\u2019s release, the director spoke out on Twitter. \u201cA year ago I had a fantastic version of this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it would\u2019ve received great reviews. You\u2019ll probably never see it. That\u2019s reality though.\u201d The film bombed at the box office, with Trank\u2019s tweet reportedly costing Fox between $5m and $10m (\u00a33.8m and \u00a37.6m). 15/20 Woman Wanted \u2013 Kiefer Sutherland During the Nineties, Kiefer Sutherland wanted to progress from acting to directing. Although his feature-film debut as director, 1997\u2019s Truth or Consequences, was not exactly a critical success, he persevered, directing the 2000 flick Woman Wanted. Sutherland was so disappointed with the results, he released the film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee \u2013 becoming the last person to ever use the famed name. He has not directed a film since. 16/20 An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn \u2013 Alan Smithee/Arthur Hiller A film about the pseudonym Alan Smithee that ironically ended up being an Alan Smithee film. Arthur Hiller had no intention of disowning Burn Hollywood Burn, which aimed to lampoon the Hollywood system. The film centred on a director, named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle), who hands in a cut of a film, only for the studio to recut the entire thing. Life mirrored art as the studio behind Burn Hollywood Burn took the film away from Hiller, who ended up using the Smithee pseudonym on the release. 17/20 Dune \u2013 David Lynch Following the success of Oscar Best Picture winner The Elephant Man, David Lynch could have done almost anything. Despite having not read the book, Lynch agreed to adapt Dune, choosing the project over the third Star Wars, Return of the Jedi. Lynch soon started work on turning Frank Herbert\u2019s epic novel into a screenplay, turning in over five drafts. Yet, despite the preparation time, the final results were less than satisfactory for the director. \u201cI started selling out on Dune,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I probably shouldn't have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in.\u201d 18/20 Alien 3 \u2013 David Fincher David Fincher was just 28 years old when the producers of Alien decided to bring the upstart on board their second sequel. With just five weeks\u2019 preparation time, an unfinished script, and no real clout behind his name, Fincher struggled with the film. \u201cOh, it was just awful,\u201d he later said. \u201cThis is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d In 2009, promoting The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher elaborated: \u201cI had to work on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.\u201d 19/20 Hellraiser: Bloodline \u2013 Kevin Yagher The fourth film in the horror series Hellraiser had a troubled production. Original director Kevin Yagher was ordered by the studio to reshoot scenes, which he refused to do. Joe Chappelle stepped in, leading to Yagher demanding the Alan Smithee pseudonym be used. The final film \u2013 which acted as both a prequel and a sequel to the other three films \u2013 was not screened for critics, and was dismissed by many fans. 20/20 Accidental Love \u2013 David O Russell David O Russell began working on Nailed in 2008. Envisioning the film as a romantic comedy with political undertones, the director cast Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in leading roles, and was awarded $26 million (\u00a320 million) to make it. And still, somehow, the entire filming process was a mess. The set was shutdown a reported 14 times after cast and crew complained about not being paid. Eventually, after key scenes were not filmed during production, the entire thing was abandoned. After Russell started drawing Oscars attention for The Fighter and American Hustle, though, the studio wanted to get Nailed out in cinemas. Work continued on the film without Russell\u2019s involvement. The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director\u2019s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results.\n\nMuch of Blache\u2019s early years seemed to prepare her for a life in cinema, filled as they were with adventures, deprivations and moments of fortitude. In her first secretarial position, in an all-male factory, she recalled, she boldly stood up to a sexual harasser.\n\n\u201cMy youth, my inexperience, my sex,\u201d Blach\u00e9 wrote of her entrance into cinema, \u201call conspired against me.\u201d But she was hardworking and tenacious, and would prove to be prolific.\n\nIn 1894, she talked Gaumont, then the second-in-command at a photography company, into hiring her. Not long after, Gaumont formed his own company and Blache became a pioneer, making films that were coloured by hand and others that used a pioneering sound system, which synced visuals with prerecorded wax cylinders. Blache can be seen in one clip starting a phonograph while she directs both the cast and the crew. Among her Gaumont titles are La Femme Collante, a risque charmer about a maid with an amusingly sticky tongue, and Le Matelas Alcoolique about a peripatetic mattress with a drunken man sewn into it.\n\nIn 1907, she married Herbert Blache, another Gaumont employee, and resigned as head of film production to accompany him to the United States, where he was sent to promote Gaumont\u2019s sync-sound film system. The undertaking was a bust. But in 1910, two years after giving birth to their daughter, Simone, Blache formed the Solax Company and began making her own movies. She was so successful that in 1912 \u2013 the year she gave birth to their son, Reginald \u2013 Blache built her own state-of-the-art studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, then a bustling film town.\n\nShe kept up a heroic pace at Solax. She would jump in her car or on a horse to scout locations, including an orphanage, an opium parlour, night court and Sing Sing prison, where she declined the invitation to witness an execution. She supervised other directors and assistants, oversaw a stock company of adult and child actors, and corralled a menagerie of animal performers, among them rats, lions, panthers and a 600-pound tiger named Princess. On one studio wall she hung a sign that read \u201cBe Natural\u201d.\n\nHer interest in realism as well as performance dovetailed with what her biographer Alison McMahan said was Blache\u2019s greatest achievement. Her films, McMahan said in a phone interview, \u201cfocused on the psychological perspective of the central characters\u201d.\n\nBlache told The Clipper in 1912: \u201cI have always impressed upon my associate directors that success comes only to those who give the public what it wants, plus something else. That something else I would call our individuality, if you please.\u201d\n\nBlache expanded her repertoire at Solax with cowboy films like Two Little Rangers, which features a pair of gun-toting heroines, one of them a girl with long curls who backs a villain off a cliff. Whether or not it was feminist by design, the film is feminist by default. Blache wondered if women were ready for the right to vote, but in her actions and in her films she expressed female drives, desires and self-determination.\n\nAt Solax, she successfully made the transition to feature filmmaking, creating longer, more narratively complex titles that were well-received, though they also entailed higher production costs and longer preparations. Yet while Blache navigated the shift to features creatively, she didn\u2019t weather the seismic changes affecting the fast-growing movie world, including monopolistic distribution practices. By 1914, she and her husband had joined forces with another enterprise for which they both directed.\n\nThe last chapter of Blache\u2019s filmmaking career was marred by setbacks and disappointments both in her new ventures with her husband and as a director for hire. She made The Ocean Waif, a touching romance about an abused young woman and a writer that gives (almost) equal weight to both.\n\nOther films followed, but by the time she directed the well-regarded Her Great Adventure, Blache was struggling with her health, financial difficulties, a broken marriage and continued industry upheaval. She declined to direct a Tarzan movie. In 1922, the Solax studio was auctioned off, and Blache, now divorced, returned to France with her two children.\n\nIn France she tried to find film work with no luck. It\u2019s unclear why she didn\u2019t succeed, although by the 1920s, the movies were a big business and no longer as hospitable to women who wanted to make their own films. She sold her books, paintings and other possessions and wrote articles and children\u2019s stories.\n\nShe and her daughter, who worked for the American Foreign Service, spent the last years of the Second World War in Switzerland, where Blache began writing her memoir. She also tried to find her films, but most were unavailable and presumed lost. She nevertheless persevered, gave interviews and in time gained some recognition for her pioneering role in cinema.\n\nBlach\u00e9 wrote of her life: \u201cIt is a failure; is it a success? I don\u2019t know.\u201d She died on 24 March 1968, in a nursing home in New Jersey. She was 94.\n\nIn 2012, the Fort Lee Film Commission installed a new gravestone for Blache. The original one had noted only her name and the dates of her birth and death. The new memorial states that Alice Guy Blache was the \u201cfirst woman motion picture director,\u201d the \u201cfirst woman studio head\u201d and the \u201cpresident of the Solax Company, Fort Lee, NJ.\u201d\n\nThe memorial is also adorned with the Solax logo: an image of the sun rising on a new day.\n\n\u00a9 New York Times", "description": "In 1911, The Moving Picture News wrote that Alice Guy Blache, the first female filmmaker in history, was a \u201cfine example of what a woman can do if given a square chance in life\u201d.", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/12/alice-guy-blache.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
