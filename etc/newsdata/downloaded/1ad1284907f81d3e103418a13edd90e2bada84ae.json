Final delivery of the Zumwalt with full combat capability was initially expected in September.\n\nNAVSEA said that the Zumwalt \"has been conducting combat system testing concurrently with post-delivery test and trials,\" adding that \"while combat system testing has made significant progress, Zumwalt continues to work through first-in-class integration and shipboard test challenges.\"\n\nRead more: Here are 5 of the worst weapons projects the US military has in the works\n\nThe latest delivery delay, Bloomberg reports, puts final delivery six years behind schedule, and while NAVSEA says that plans for the ship to achieve initial operating capability (IOC) in September 2021 remain on track, that will still be three years later than first expected.\n\nThe Zumwalt is a multimission surface ship that, like the USS Gerald R. Ford and the Littoral Combat Ship, has long been a bit of a problem child for the Navy.\n\nThe USS Zumwalt heads down the Kennebec River after leaving Bath Iron Works, September 7, 2016 AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty\n\nThe Navy had initially planned to build 32 Zumwalt-class destroyers, but the number has since been reduced to three. The ships were expected to be tasked with carrying out naval surface fire support missions in littoral waterways, using 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) specifically designed for the task by BAE Systems.\n\nWhen the Navy realized the prospective cost of a single AGS Long-Range Land-Attack Projectile (LRLAP) had risen to at least $800,000, a byproduct of ordering fewer ships, it went in search of a cheaper alternative, which it has yet to find.\n\nThe AGS is now useless, and there is talk of totally scrapping the guns, on which the Navy spent about a half-billion dollars.\n\nRead more: The destroyer Zumwalt's big guns don't have any ammo, and the Navy may ditch them entirely because they don't even work right\n\nThe Zumwalt's warfighting mission, given its gun problems, has since changed from naval surface fire support, a mission consistent with the battleships of naval warfare decades earlier, to surface strike, targeting enemy ships and some land targets with missiles.\n\nIt's possible the AGS may be replaced with more Vertical Launch System tubes, if not another weapon system. This mission set is still being evaluated.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) explained in May, when the Zumwalt was first expected to be handed over to the Navy before the delivery schedule was revised to September, that the service is still trying to correct the more than 300 deficiencies identified when the Navy first accepted the ship from General Dynamics in May 2016.", "description": "In another setback for the troubled Zumwalt program, the final delivery of DDG-1000 has been pushed from September to next year.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c0ed9660999dd02e94a0e0c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
