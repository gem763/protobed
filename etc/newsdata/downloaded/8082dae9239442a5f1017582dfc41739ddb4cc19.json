An actor, he\u2019d memorized shorter poems before, and he wanted to see how much of the epic he could remember. \u201cAs I finished each book,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI began to perform it and keep it alive in repertory while committing the next to memory.\u201d\n\nThe twelve books of Paradise Lost contain over 60,000 words; it took Basinger about 3,000 hours to learn them by rote. He did so by reciting the piece, line-by-line out loud, for about an hour a day for nine years. When he memorized all 12 books, in 2001, Basinger performed the masterpiece in a live recital that lasted three days. Since then, he\u2019s performed smaller sections for various audiences, eventually attracting the attention of John Seamon, a psychologist at Wesleyan University, in Connecticut. In 2008, \u201cHe recited for an hour in the Wesleyan library,\u201d says Seamon. \u201cHe\u2019d given out copies of Milton\u2019s book so we could follow along. At the end of the talk I introduced myself and said \u2018I\u2019d love to study your memory.\u2019\u201d Basinger agreed, and so Seamon devised a test.\n\nThen 74, Basinger came into the lab to perform a series of cued recall tests. Scientists read two successive lines from each of the poem\u2019s 12 books and then asked Basinger to recall the next 10 lines. The results, published in Memory in 2010, were surprising: Despite the amount of elapsed time since his memorization process, Basinger\u2019s recall was, overall, word-perfect 88 percent of the time. When he was prompted with lines that opened one of the 12 books, his accuracy increased to 98 percent.\n\nSeamon wondered how he might explain this performance, and realized deliberate practice theory could be useful. Although it was \u201cformulated to account for elite performance in chess, music, and sports, it provides a reasonable basis for interpreting JB\u2019s procedure for memorising Paradise Lost,\u201d says Seamon. \u201cHe too, in daily short sessions, devoted thousands of hours of study over a period of years to achieve his mastery of Milton.\u201d But Basinger didn\u2019t just remember the words; it would be a mistake, says Seamon, to interpret Basinger\u2019s performance as \u201csimply a remarkable demonstration of brute force, rote memorisation.\u201d\n\nIn order to memorize the epic poem, he spent a lot of time repeatedly analyzing its meaning and structure. Acting researchers emphasize this strategy, Seamon notes: \u201cDeep encoding requires actors to attend to the exact wording of lines, and it is the focus on exact wording to gain an understanding of the characters that yields verbatim memory, instead of merely the retention of gist.\u201d\n\nDeep encoding involves making \u201ccomplex semantic judgments\u201d during a given task, as opposed to \u201cshallow\u201d encoding, which typically consists of just perceptual judgments\u2014like determining the color or size of words\u2014that \u201cresult in significantly poorer memory performance,\u201d say David Thomson, a psychologist at the University of Waterloo, and colleagues. Actors like Basinger use deep encoding to give \u201chonest, spontaneous performances, ones that focus on communicating the meanings underlying the literal words,\u201d according to psychologists Helga and Tony Noice. \u201cIndeed, when actors do mention memory,\u201d they write, \u201cit is usually within the context of forgetting the lines until they are needed to communicate the feeling of the moment.\u201d Basinger, Seamon says, \u201creally got into the story, what Milton was trying to convey.\u201d Noice and Noice suggest that this would aid his recall: \u201cBodily action and emotional response, in addition to semantic analysis, can enhance human memory.\u201d\n\nJohn Martin (1841)\n\nThe books describe the Biblical story of the fall of man\u2014the temptation of Eve by Satan then her and Adam\u2019s expulsion from the Garden of Eden\u2014as well as the prior civil war between God and the rebellious angels, led by Satan. Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, said the 18th century writer and critic Samuel Johnson, demonstrates \u201chis peculiar power to astonish\u201d\u2014especially in his portrayal of Satan as a heroic figure. \u201cThere is much to be gained from an aesthetic point of view by making evil characters complex, glamorous, and persuasive, and to do so without changing what they are,\u201d says Gordon Teskey, an English professor at Harvard. \u201cThe Greeks taught Milton to make a character majestic in evil without diminishing the evil of evil.\u201d (Milton\u2019s purpose, he writes in Book I, is to \u201cjustify the ways of God to men.\u201d) \u201cDuring the incessant repetition of Milton\u2019s words, I really began to listen to them,\u201d says Basinger, \u201cand every now and then as the whole poem began to take shape in my mind, an insight would come, an understanding, a delicious possibility.\u201d\n\nNothing in Basinger\u2019s tests suggested that his memory was otherwise irregular or exceptional. \u201cHis memory for everyday tasks appears entirely normal for someone his age,\u201d Seamon says. \u201cHe still forgets where he puts his keys.\u201d For those of us who struggle to remember to-do lists, it\u2019s encouraging to know: \u201cOur findings are in agreement with other research on world-class memory performers,\u201d Seamon says, \u201cwhich indicates that exceptional memorizers are made, not born.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Basinger says his years of effort have let him explore Paradise Lost as if it were a physical space. \u201cAs a cathedral I carry around in my mind,\u201d he says, \u201ca place that I can enter and walk around at will.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLois Parshley is a freelance journalist.
