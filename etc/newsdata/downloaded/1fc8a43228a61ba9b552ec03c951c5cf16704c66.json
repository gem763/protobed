That means in the case of a hypothetical atomic war, German pilots would load their aircraft with US nuclear bombs and drop them on their intended targets at the behest of the alliance.\n\nWhile Germany's nuclear mission periodically comes up as a source of controversy here, previous governments have left it untouched, portraying the largely symbolic assignment as a vital element of trans-Atlantic relations.\n\nA spokeswoman for the defense ministry in Berlin declined to comment on the SZ report, saying only that American and German defense officials had been in \"continuous conversations\" on the issue.\n\nA US Navy F-18 fighter jet lands on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson during a US-South Korea exercise in the Sea of Japan, March 14, 2017. Reuters\n\nThe government is expected to announce a winner between the F-18 and the Eurofighter Typhoon early next year. In January 2019, defense officials eliminated the F-35 as a candidate, largely because picking an American plane would weaken the case for having such weapons be made by European companies in the future.\n\nSuch is the case with the Future Combat Air Systems program, led by Airbus and Dassault. Airbus has said that Germany choosing the Eurofighter as a Tornado replacement would make it easier for companies on the continent to transition to an eventual development of the German-Franco-Spanish platform.\n\nThe German defense minister's visit to Washington last month put the spotlight back on the prospect of an American buy, however.\n\n\"We want to treat this question jointly,\" Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told reporters in the US capital on September 23. She added that Germany wants a \"gap-less\" continuation of the Tornado's capabilities, adding that she envisions a \"tight schedule\" for the replacement.\n\nAirbus, meanwhile, doesn't see the rush. With 10 years or so to go before ditching the Tornado, the reported nuclear-certification time seems to still fit into the overall replacement schedule, spokesman Florian Taitsch told Defense News.\n\nPlus, he argued, it should be expected that, when given a choice, the Trump administration with its \"America First\" doctrine would be keen to push American-made weapons over European ones.\n\n\"For us, the situation hasn't changed,\" Taitsch said.", "description": "According to German media, the competition has tilted toward the US jet because it wouldn't take as long to certify it to carry nuclear weapons.", "authors": ["Sebastian Sprenger", "Defense News"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ac394027a74af23008b45bc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
