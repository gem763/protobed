In it, the \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d veteran sings about Barbies as voodoo dolls, spiders and \u201cchewing gum from under chairs,\u201d giving her over-the-top brand a frightfully fabulous makeover for October. Comedian Bobby Moynihan also pops up, channeling Vincent Prince in a cheeky intro.\n\n\u201cI wanted to create a new character that could live in the world of Halloween that we all know and love, kinda like David S. Pumpkins,\u201d West told HuffPost of the video. \u201cIt was important for me to tap into the Halloween that I love so much. I am not one for the gore and the blood and guts, but more so in love with the classic Universal monsters, the camp of the holiday and the colors!\u201d\n\nWilly Sanjuan/Invision/AP Nina West arrives at the world premiere of \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cLisa Frankenstein\u201d is the latest project in a prolific year for West, who placed sixth on the 11th season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d in May. This spring, she dropped both a children\u2019s music EP, \u201cDrag Is Magic,\u201d and a comedy recording, \u201cJohn Goodman.\u201d\n\nStill, the Ohio native said the \u201cLisa Frankenstein\u201d video is particularly special.\n\n\u201cHalloween is a time for celebration, but for queer people, it\u2019s a time when we can be fabulous and strut our stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wear all these masks throughout the year and Halloween is another night of freedom. It\u2019s like another Pride.\u201d\n\nOf course, West is aware her latest release comes at a time of turmoil for many in the LGBTQ community. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in three individual cases which will determine whether or not Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, also includes LGBTQ people.\n\nLegal experts say the ruling, which is expected in 2020, will be a definitive representation of where the U.S. stands on LGBTQ rights.\n\nSantiago Felipe via Getty Images \"I wanted to create a new character that could live in the world of Halloween that we all know and love,\" West said of her new video, \"Lisa Frankenstein.\"\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in our country is scary, but it should be a reminder yet again, we should never let our guard down and we should always speak up,\u201d West said. \u201cIn these trying times, we must stand up and let our voices be heard. Registering to vote, contacting out representatives and being active. We cannot be quiet, we must unite.\u201d\n\nThat said, West expects to be in a festive mood from now until Dec. 31. She\u2019s currently at work on a Christmas EP, slated to hit streaming platforms and online retailers later this fall.\n\n\u201cWhether you have a belief system or not, the magic of the holidays is real,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to share that with my fans.\u201d", "description": "The queen enlists Bobby Moynihan for \"Lisa Frankenstein,\" and wants to remind fans Halloween is \"another Pride\" for LGBTQ people to \"strut our stuff.\"", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f7e87200000da064ff5ae.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
