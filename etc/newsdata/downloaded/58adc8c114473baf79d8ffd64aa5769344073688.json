I believe rich people should pay more. I have no problem with that. This wealth tax is baloney,\" he added.\n\nParaphrasing late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Cooperman said that \"you don't make poor people rich by making rich people poor.\"\n\nCooperman is not alone among wealthy Americans who believe rich people should be taxed more.\n\nBillionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have also said for a long time that taxes should go up on the wealthy. But they, too, believe there are better ways to make the tax system more fair than a wealth tax.\n\nCNBC has reached out to the Warren and Sanders campaigns for comment.", "description": "\"They make it sound like rich people don't pay taxes,\" says the billionaire investor.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky", "Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105904235-1557429780990img_2731rr.jpg?v=1571223949", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
