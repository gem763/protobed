Vaping related illnesses are leveling out or declining, but nobody knows why, yet. Meanwhile, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) says releasing its guidance on e-cigarette flavors is a top priority.\n\nWe'll start with family separations:\n\nMore than 1,500 migrant children separated from parents than previously reported\n\nMore than 1,500 children were forcibly separated from their parents before the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy took effect, government officials told a federal court.\n\nComplying with a court order from a federal judge in San Diego, the administration told the American Civil Liberties Union that 1,556 additional children had been separated.\n\nJudge Dana Sabraw, a George W. Bush appointee, had given the administration six months to account for potentially thousands of previously unreported children, that were identified in a government watchdog report from January. The administration handed over the new numbers Thursday, just a day ahead of the deadline.\n\nThe government initially said it could take up to two years to review the cases of as many as 47,000 unaccompanied children who were taken into custody during an influx that occurred between July 1, 2017 and June 26, 2018 to find the most likely separated.\n\nIn the end, the administration found just over 1,500 after being ordered to complete the process in six months. The ACLU does not know if the additional families have been reunited.\n\nAccording to government figures disclosed through the ACLU's lawsuit, more than 2,800 children were separated from their parents under the \"zero tolerance\" as of late 2018.\n\nSabraw ordered separations to stop over a year ago, but almost 1,000 migrant children have been separated from their parents since, despite the ruling.\n\nRead more here.\n\nFDA working 'as quickly as possible' on e-cigarette flavor ban\n\nIt's been well over a month since President Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE said the administration was going to ban all flavors of e-cigarettes, and officials promised a plan would be released soon. So far, there hasn't been any indication that one is coming.\n\nA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official said Friday the agency is working \"as quickly as possible\" to finalize guidance that would remove flavored e-cigarette products from the market.\n\n\"This is a very, very high priority, and we're trying to complete work on it as quickly as possible,\" Mitch Zeller, director of the Center for Tobacco Products for the FDA, said on a call with reporters.\n\nThe Trump administration's announcement was met with fierce opposition from the vaping industry and conservatives, who argue that removing flavors would hurt small businesses and adults who use the products to quit smoking traditional cigarettes.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last month the ban would include mint and menthol flavors, but the administration is now considering exempting those products, Bloomberg News reported Friday.\n\nZeller declined to comment on whether the FDA is considering an exemption for those flavors, saying only that deliberations are \"ongoing.\"\n\nReaction: Doctors and anti-tobacco advocates are warning the administration not to carve out exemptions for mint and menthol products, arguing those flavors are also popular among kids.\n\n\"A failure to remove mint and menthol e-cigarettes from the market would be a capitulation to Juul and other companies that created the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic,\" reads a joint statement issued Friday by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Cancer Society Action Network and others.\n\nThe other side: The American Vaping Association, an industry group, said it was \"heartened\" to see the Trump administration reportedly reconsidering the flavor ban, at least partially.\n\nBut it still argues that no flavors should be banned, because they're helpful to adults trying to quit smoking traditional cigarettes.\n\n\"President Trump should scrap the flavor ban altogether and work on solutions that actually make sense for both adults and youth,\" said AVA President Gregory Conley.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn other vaping news...\n\nNumber of vaping-related illnesses appearing to level off\n\nCases of vaping-related lung illness appear to be leveling off or declining, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday.\n\nBut it's not clear why that is or what is making people sick, said Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director for the CDC.\n\nSince the outbreak began earlier this year, the CDC says, there have been 1,604 confirmed and probable lung injury cases, including 34 deaths.\n\nThat's an increase of 125 cases from what the CDC reported last week.\n\n\"Although the epidemic curve ... suggests the trajectory may be leveling off or even declining, you may wonder if the peak of cases has passed,\" Schuchat said in a call with reporters.\n\nPossible reasons:\n\nThe public has listened to the CDC's warnings to stop using THC vaping products, especially those bought off the street, because they've been tied to most of the cases.\n\nLocal and federal law enforcement efforts have cut off the supply chain in some areas.\n\nHealth departments are doing less intensive investigations or there is a lag in reporting cases to the CDC.\n\nRead more here.\n\nPoll: Voters rate Sanders most honest on how plan affects health costs\n\nVoters rated Sen.

There's no denying that fact, and as the primary season heats up, candidates are facing tough questions over how they'll pay for their health plans.\n\nSanders has been upfront about the fact that taxes will have to go up for the middle class to pay for his plan, but he argues middle-class people will save money overall once the elimination of premiums and deductibles is factored in.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, has taken heat for declining to directly answer the middle-class tax question. She has said she supports Bernie's plan, and has said she will soon be releasing her own ideas on how to pay for it.\n\nRead more on the poll here.\n\nSponsored Content - Partnership for America's Health Care Future\n\nIndependent studies estimate the cost of some one-size-fits-all health care proposals could more than double income taxes for every American family.
