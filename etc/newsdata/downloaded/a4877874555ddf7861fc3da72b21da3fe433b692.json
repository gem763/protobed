When they say \u201chearsay,\u201d they seem to hope that Americans will hear \u201crumor.\u201d Perhaps they think the public will imagine a courtroom scene from \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d where an attorney jumps up and shouts, \u201cHearsay!,\u201d after which a judge considers the matter carefully and says: \u201cSustained! The jury will disregard.\u201d\n\nNone of this makes much sense. The first problem with the Republicans' hearsay defense is that the White House\u2019s rough transcript confirmed much of what the whistleblower was told by several officials. But even if that memo had not been released, the complaints about hearsay would be missing the mark. Hearsay does not mean \u201cunreliable information,\u201d and it can play an important and legitimate part in many kinds of investigations and legal proceedings. So, while Trump and his allies are correct that the whistleblower report could not, by itself, be introduced as evidence in a criminal trial, that\u2019s entirely beside the point.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHearsay \u2014 to simplify a bit \u2014 refers to statements made outside of court. If a witness sees a truck hit a car, and his sister tells him that she saw the truck run a red light immediately beforehand, the witness can testify only to the accident. If he repeats what his sister told him about the red light, that is hearsay. The sister would have to come in to tell the jury directly what she saw.\n\nThere are exceptions to the ban on hearsay evidence. If a statement was made under oath, at a previous hearing or deposition, the Federal Rules of Evidence assume that under certain circumstances it is reliable enough to be admissible, even if the speaker does not appear in court. There\u2019s also a \u201cdying declaration\u201d exception: If an man on his deathbed proclaims that his son killed the family cat, that, too, can be used in court. The law assumes (rightly or wrongly) that people who think they are dying are more likely to tell the truth.\n\nWhy Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should resign\n\nTo be considered hearsay, a statement must not only have been made outside court but also put forward to establish the truth of whatever was said. As in: The truck really did run the red light. Some secondhand statements are introduced to show someone\u2019s state of mind \u2014 that they were angry, say (in which case the statements could be admitted).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese are important rules for trial lawyers, but they have little to do with the whistleblower complaint, which was not introduced at a trial. And using hearsay is entirely acceptable in all sorts of contexts, including formal investigations.\n\nLaw enforcement is expected to use hearsay to lead to more direct sources of information. If police are trying to solve a murder, and a woman tells them she has heard from several people that her neighbor was the culprit, they don\u2019t discount that statement because it isn\u2019t firsthand; they follow that lead in search of direct evidence. That\u2019s pretty much what happened with the whistleblower complaint: It prompted officials to seek the rough transcript, which is not hearsay. And on Thursday, the House deposed the former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who provided incriminating text messages, among other evidence.\n\nGrand juries, which decide whether formal criminal charges can be brought against a suspect, can also rely on hearsay \u2014 weighing things a police officer testifies she heard during her investigation, for instance. The impeachment inquiry in the House will determine whether the Senate should proceed with a trial, making it analogous to grand jury proceedings. So there would logically be no ban on hearsay in that context. What\u2019s more, impeachment trials in the Senate don\u2019t follow the rules of criminal trials, so hearsay could be introduced there, too, if the Senate chose to allow it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe nugget of truth in the Republican talking point is that suffering consequences solely because of hearsay can feel unfair \u2014 and sometimes be unfair. But if Graham and others are truly concerned about such apparent injustices, they might focus instead on hearsay\u2019s use in instances that harm the lives of those less powerful than the president. I worked as a public defender for five years in the Bronx, and I saw hundreds of people arrested, handcuffed, fingerprinted, interrogated and detained \u2014 all on the basis of hearsay. This is utterly routine in the American criminal justice system. One police officer writes a complaint saying that a different officer saw a man hand a package to another man. The officer says that in his judgment it was a drug sale, and suddenly, before any substances have been tested or witnesses heard, a person is taken from his life, job and family, and thrown in jail. If the grand jury in that case relies on hearsay in issuing an indictment, the person can be incarcerated for months or years, awaiting trial.\n\nThe defendants in such cases might later get their day in court (if they aren\u2019t coerced into taking a plea deal first), where the hearsay rules do apply. But those rules don\u2019t apply in all courtrooms. Judges in immigration court rely on hearsay regularly when denying people asylum or other forms of relief, for instance.\n\nMeanwhile, prisoners who wait years for a parole date can be denied by parole boards if a guard reports hearing a secondhand account of a rule violation. Federal judges are free to consider hearsay evidence at sentencing, in deciding how much of the rest of their life someone spends in prison.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe unquestioning use of hearsay does present problems, and we might consider tightening the rules in various non-trial contexts. But the Republican complaints ring hollow in the current controversy. Impeachment proponents would be naive to rely exclusively on hearsay in building a case against President Trump \u2014 and they aren\u2019t doing so. They know they face an uphill battle in the Senate and want to make the strongest case possible. The House is already subpoenaing people with firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine call and the events surrounding it and moving toward demanding documents of relevant calls with other world leaders. Unlike immigrants facing deportation, criminal defendants facing jail and parole candidates facing longer sentences, the president is in absolutely no danger of suffering penalties on the basis of hearsay alone.\n\nTwitter: @SarahLustbader\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nFive myths about Hispanics\n\nI owe my new life to my Marine husband\u2019s hideous death.
