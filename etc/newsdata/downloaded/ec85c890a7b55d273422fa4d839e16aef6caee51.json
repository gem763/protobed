As of Thursday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 201 residents.\n\nInteractive Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco September 2019 October 2018\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter.\n\nEight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said.\n\nA $5.4m (\u00a34.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas.\n\nWhere is Dorian now?\n\nNow downgraded to a category 2 hurricane, Dorian is slowly churning north-east along the eastern US seaboard, where it still poses a threat.\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 23:00 local time (03:00 GMT) Dorian was 35 miles (60km) south of Wilmington in North Carolina and moving north-east at about 13mph.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hurricane Dorian causes floods and tornadoes in South Carolina\n\nThe US states of North and South Carolina are at risk of dangerous storm surges on Friday before the hurricane moves towards Nova Scotia at the weekend.\n\nIs climate change making hurricanes worse?\n\nScientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump\n\nSea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hurricanes and climate change\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:\n\nHurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
