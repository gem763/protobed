SpaceX\n\nSpaceX is hoping Starship, its experimental rocket, will eventually take humans to Mars from its spaceport in southern Texas.\n\nFor years, SpaceX has been slowly buying property in Boca Chica Village under subsidiaries.\n\nSpaceX recently sent residents a mass-mailed offer to decide in two weeks whether they wanted to sell their homes for three times what it says is an independently appraised value.\n\nNeighboring residents of Boca Chica Village are worried they will be forced from their homes as the spaceport grows. Many are retired and chose this place for the pristine beach and the solitude.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nSpaceX calls this the Starhopper, an early prototype of a ship it hopes will take us to Mars. But so far it's only gone about 500 feet up in the air before landing back on Earth.\n\nIn order to go from testing to travelling, SpaceX needs a good home for its future. For founder Elon Musk, that home is Boca Chica Village, a tiny hamlet in southern Texas.\n\nElon Musk: We've got a lot of land with nobody around. And so if it blows up, it's cool.\n\nBut it's not nobody. SpaceX has fewer than a dozen neighbors who live within two miles.\n\nBoca Chica Village in southern Texas is now home to SpaceX's experimental rocket development site. Jennifer Lee\n\nMaria Pointer: I don't know if they're going to let us live at our last days here. And that's scary.\n\nNeighbors who no longer feel welcome in their own homes since SpaceX is aggressively trying to buy their land.\n\nResidents of Boca Chica Village have received buyout offers from SpaceX as the company grows its footprint\n\nAll of them received a letter dated September 12th from the company offering to buy their homes for what SpaceX says is three times an independently appraised value.\n\nSpaceX has been slowly buying property in the area for years.\n\nBut the company's mass-mailed offer gave residents only two weeks to decide whether to take the money and leave, or stay and deal with an experimental spaceship in their backyards.\n\nAnd as the project grows in size, residents worry about their safety.\n\nDespite the risks, many don't want to give up their homes.\n\nRay and Maria Pointer are two of the several neighbors who no longer feel welcome in their own homes. Jennifer Lee\n\nRay Pointer: I spent my time doing my thing, and I came down here to enjoy the rest of it. And to now put a price on it? No doubt, it's supposed to be fair-market value for packing up and going away. I'm retired here for chrissakes.\n\nSpaceX started buying property in Boca Chica under subsidiaries like Dogleg Park LLC as early as 2012.\n\nAt the time, the company and the county agreed the area was supposed to be a commercial spaceport that launched about 12 missions a year with existing rockets.\n\nBut SpaceX has outgrown that original proposal. Even the FAA has noted it has since turned into an experimental rocket development site for Starship \u2014 a nearly 400-foot tall vehicle that dwarfs Starhopper.\n\nAnd now, locals have to deal with frequent test launches, constant road blocks, and the possibility that this ship could be at least six times taller.\n\nSpaceX's Starhopper is an early prototype of a rocket that will be nearly 400 feet tall and may one day take humans to Mars. Jennifer Lee\n\nCarlos Cascos: It was going to be relatively simple for the community that did not live in that adjacent area to welcome it. But we had to really kind of deal with those folks that live in that area.\n\nThese folks tried years ago to organize petitions, write letters, and hire lawyers to stop the program, but their efforts weren't successful.\n\nCelia Johnson: One thing I learned is that a small neighborhood like ours \u2014 35 homes with mostly retirees, mostly fixed incomes \u2014 cannot fight big money, and Musk has the big money.\n\nAnd many worry about the environmental impact from rocket launches.\n\nBoca Chica contains a wildlife reserve home to several endangered and semi-endangered species. Jennifer Lee\n\nSam Clauson: This is a large wildlife reserve and it has quite a few endangered species or semi-endangered species.\n\nSouthern Texas is a logical \u2014 and cost-effective \u2014 place for a private spaceport\n\nBut it turns out putting a spaceport in this spot can save SpaceX money.\n\nMost rockets launch over oceans to limit their danger to people.\n\nThat means that in the event of an accident here, like a mid-air explosion, debris will fall into the Gulf of Mexico instead of onto land.\n\nBut its southern location also puts it in an ideal spot for launching rockets.\n\nThe closer a rocket is to the equator, the less fuel it takes to get something into orbit.\n\nThat's because the rotation of the earth gives it a boost in momentum.\n\nAnd the less energy it takes a rocket to get up to speed, the heavier a payload it can launch.\n\nIt's why the Kennedy Space Center is only a few degrees north in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nBut Cape Canaveral has far more land.\n\nThere, the public viewing area is over three miles away. By contrast, here in Texas, some residents are twice as close to SpaceX's pad.\n\nAnd safety could become a bigger concern.\n\nEspecially since Starship might require nearly twice the firepower of any rocket ever launched at Cape Canaveral, including those used during NASA's Apollo program.\n\nThe ideal location to launch a rocket is over an ocean and near the equator. SpaceX\n\nIn late July, the first successful test launch of Starhopper almost immediately started brush fires near the launch pad.\n\nAnd despite efforts from emergency workers, fire spread into the nearby Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area. A number of residents feared it might even reach their homes.\n\nThat's one of the reasons why the FAA is requiring SpaceX to hold $100 million in liability insurance coverage to get its latest launch license.\n\nEvery time SpaceX conducts a new test or launch the sheriff closes Highway 4 \u2014 the only road in or out of the village.\n\nThese closures can last up to a day, and many times residents receive little-to-no notice.\n\nSam Clauson: I mean, if they've got a closure going on, we should be notified. There's only like 30 residences here. It wouldn't take long to put a notice in the mailboxes.\n\nMaria Pointer: Oh my God, it's just so confusing. And you talk to the sheriff and they say, \"You're going to be arrested if you're not off Highway 4 by 10 o'clock.\" And I'm like, but I live here!\n\nAnd many residents don't fully understand what SpaceX is testing, and what it has planned for the future.\n\nSam Clauson: You know, are we going to be safe here? Are we going to lose our land? You know, most of us came down here are here because we're retired and wanted a nice quiet place to live.\n\nMany residents of Boca Chica Village chose the the area for its solitude. Jennifer Lee\n\nThe Brownsville area stands to gain economically from SpaceX's presence in Texas\n\nTensions weren't always so high.\n\nMany people and organizations in the greater Brownsville area, just 20 miles away, initially welcomed SpaceX \u2014 hoping the tech giant would bring jobs to one of the poorest regions in the country.\n\nThat's why county and state officials set aside millions in direct support and tax breaks for SpaceX.\n\nCarlos Cascos: The way it was set up, it was going to change the economic landscape of the valley.\n\nBut the prospect of economic prosperity means little to some Boca Chica residents.\n\nMany are retired and chose this place for the pristine beach, abundance of wildlife, and the solitude.\n\nIt's why Maria and Ray Pointer spent two decades building their retirement home here.\n\nMaria Pointer: Just envision nothing here, but grasslands and a shack.\n\nNow, their property is flanked by solar panels, two gigantic tracking antennas, and a bustling rocket construction yard, all courtesy of SpaceX.\n\nMaria Pointer: The sun was getting ready to set, and it set right behind that brand new house of SpaceX. And I just cried. I could almost cry right now because it was, it was so desolate and primitive and... Hey, I'm sorry. There's just some people that like it that way.\n\nAnd Maria Pointer says she will fight to keep her home until her last days.\n\nThe Pointers spend two decades renovating their home for retirement. Jennifer Lee\n\nMaria Pointer: You couldn't give a person enough replacement value for this. If you gave a person $10 million, you might find somewhere isolated on a bay, near a sea shore, or on a river, but the taxes would be so high. They'd be $15,000 a year, how would you afford it?\n\nEminent domain could be the next step if villagers won't sell to the company\n\nResidents and regional lawyers suspect these recent offers could signal a coming eminent domain process, which could force owners to sell the properties to the company against their will.\n\nRay Pointer: \"It seems to me, SpaceX could go to the county, or whatever entity hosts jurisdiction and make a request and say, 'You know, hey, these guys really in the way we. We would really prefer not to have human beings out here. Can you accommodate us in some way to assure that we can get this space and be unencumbered and to do our thing?'\"\n\nCameron County established a Spaceport Development Corporation in 2013 to attract space companies to the area, and to be able to give out incentives directly to SpaceX.\n\nAnd so while SpaceX can't force residents out of their homes, this corporation could.\n\nYet Judge Cascos, who help bring SpaceX to the area and signed off on the original plan, is skeptical.\n\nCarlos Cascos: The only way it could would be if the county decided to purchase everything and then build something on it. I've been, but I don't see that happening. I don't think that they can do that as a public safety issue. They could change the law for that. but I don't see that happening.\n\nAnd if SpaceX can't get the residents to sell, the company has to decide whether they keep trying or cut their losses.\n\nCarlos Cascos: It's a drop in the bucket to a company like SpaceX or Elon Musk. I mean so if they spend $300,000 on land, big deal, it's a multibillion-dollar company. It's nothing to them. They'll let it go they'll just eat it and move onto something else.\n\nAnd in the end, even when faced with rethinking her retirement dreams, Maria still has the future of spaceflight in her backyard.\n\nMaria Pointer: We thought this was going to be our last chapter. That's a very grievous feeling, that it's not. But if you just take that and remove that, then it's an experience that not anybody I know ever lived next to a rocket being built. I get to look at this shiny sunrise, this orange sun glisten off of a rocket ship.\"\n\nSpaceX didn't respond to our requests for comment in time for publication.
