Vendors not only sell tulip bulbs but also narcissus, snowdrops, carnations, violets, peonies and orchids.\n\nInvestigators found a similar problem on the so-called flower bulb boulevard in Lisse, a bulb-field town south of Amsterdam where the famous Keukenhof gardens are also situated.\n\nOf the bulbs bought from the rows of stalls along a main road in Lisse, only 2% ever bloomed, the KAVB said.\n\nSince first imported from the Ottoman empire 400 years ago, tulips have become a national symbol and the bulb industry a main player in the Dutch economy, Le Clercq said.\n\n\u201cBut the deception about the tulip bulbs is a problem that has been existing for the past 20 years,\u201d he added.\n\nThe victims are often tourists, the KAVB director, Andr\u00e9 Hoogendijk, said. \u201cA tourist who buys a bad bulb is not likely to come back,\u201d he told AT5 news channel.\n\nVendors at the market told AT5 that complaints were known. \u201cThere are indeed stalls here that sell rubbish. That is to everyone\u2019s disadvantage, because it portrays the whole flower market in a bad light,\u201d one said.\n\nAmsterdam and the KAVB have referred the matter to the Dutch consumer watchdog.", "description": "Millions of visitors duped at floating market as only 1% of bulbs bloom, inquiry shows", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In The Hague"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/153046b166b44ee0c846f0578bbefd5fdbabcc41/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77ad3227b5dd7b205604a42dbb52c406", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
