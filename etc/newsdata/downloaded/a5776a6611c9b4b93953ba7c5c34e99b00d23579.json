With the vaping controversy bringing negative publicity to the cannabis industry, October might not be so auspicious for Aurora stock holders \u2014 but then, we could perhaps dig a little deeper to find some very good reasons to hold onto those Aurora Cannabis stock shares.\n\nOne Analyst\u2019s Mixed Messages on ACB Stock\n\nIt\u2019s funny how an analyst can run hot and cold on the same exact stock at the same exact time, and we\u2019ve got a textbook example of this with Aurora stock. In particular, Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett recently proclaimed that ACB stock is \u201cone of the best-placed to succeed on a global basis over the long term,\u201d a ringing endorsement if I ever heard one. He also predicted that the company\u2019s EBITDA will turn positive during Q2 of 2019.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the same breath, however, Bennett turned around and literally halved his price objective on Aurora Cannabis stock from C$14 to C$7. And yet, he\u2019s assigning a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on ACB stock \u2014 go figure.\n\nBennett reminds me of those Katy Perry lyrics: \u201cYou\u2019re hot and you\u2019re cold/You\u2019re yes and you\u2019re no.\u201d In a way, though, I can understand the price-target cut, as the ACB stock price has recently dipped under the C$5 level, making C$14 perhaps a bit unrealistic even with Cannabis 2.0 coming up. So yes, I understand why Bennett chose C$7 as a price target, but it still felt drastic when I first heard about it.\n\nThe Incredible Edibles Market\n\nIn order to sidestep the controversial vaping market, some cannabis companies have chosen to focus on edibles, a niche which I find fascinating. It\u2019s important to understand that the term \u201cedibles\u201d covers a variety of products: as the University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s Jacob Kirsch explains in a highly informative research paper on taxation in the cannabis industry, extracts from the hemp plant are \u201cinfused into food and beverages to produce edibles. Additional ingestible goods such as capsules and tinctures are also sold as edibles.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a study conducted by research firm Deloitte found that half of surveyed respondents were likely to try cannabis-enhanced cookies, while nearly as many (49%, to be exact) were likely to try cannabis-infused gummies. It\u2019s probably no coincidence, then, that Aurora Cannabis is shifting towards edibles in a time when vaping is less fashionable.\n\nTo that end, Aurora has been granted a processing license from Health Canada (the nation\u2019s regulatory agency) for a facility known as Aurora Air. This particular facility will produce edible products including chocolates and gummies, which are expected to go public in Canada as soon as December of this year.\n\nI consider that to be a very forward-thinking move on Aurora\u2019s part, as edibles don\u2019t carry the stigma that vaping products do. The fact that Health Canada granted the Aurora Air license, moreover, is a sign that the nation\u2019s regulators accept and embrace edibles as a publicly purveyed commodity; you can love \u2019em or hate \u2019em, but edibles are here to stay.\n\nThe Takeaway on Aurora Stock\n\nDon\u2019t let the Jeffries analyst\u2019s mixed bag of expectations on ACB stock throw you for a loop; with an early move into the burgeoning edibles market and the green light from Health Canada, Aurora will flourish through Cannabis 2.0 and beyond.\n\nAs of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Cannabis 2.0 Is Coming: Watch ACB Stock Very Closely appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "In case you didn't get the memo, what's popularly known as \"Cannabis 2.0\" is coming to Canada on Oct. 17 as the nation finally legalizes cannabis-infused beverages, edibles, vapes, and similar products.
