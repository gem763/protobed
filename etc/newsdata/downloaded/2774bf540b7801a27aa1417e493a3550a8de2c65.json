Kaling told Elle she had been the only person dropped from the list of producers credited on the show when it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer via Getty Images Mindy Kaling speaks onstage during Elle\u2019s 26th Annual Women In Hollywood Celebration on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list,\u201d Kaling said on Twitter of the incident. \u201cJust me. The most junior person, and woman of color.\u201d\n\nShe told Elle she had to get letters from \u201call the other male, white producers\u201d on the show, attesting that she contributed.\n\nWhile speaking to BuzzFeed, Fischer and Kinsey admitted that at the time, they didn\u2019t know this had happened to Kaling, but Fischer said she was \u201cso glad that she spoke up and said something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, because that\u2019s crap,\u201d Kinsey added.\n\nRoy Rochlin via Getty Images Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer on BuzzFeed's \"AM to DM\" Thursday.\n\nFischer then referenced a statement the Television Academy made to the Los Angeles Times, in which it stated that many people were asked to \u201cjustify their producer credits.\u201d\n\nIt also said that at the time there was \u201can increasing concern years ago regarding the number of performers and writers seeking producer credits. At the time the Producers Guild worked with the Television Academy to correctly vet producer eligibility.\u201d\n\nBut Fischer wasn\u2019t buying that.\n\n\u201cI saw that there was a response from the Academy that said something like because she had multiple roles on the show it flagged her,\u201d Fischer told BuzzFeed. \u201cAnd I think my response would be, well, so did BJ Novak, Mike Schur, and so did Paul Lieberstein. They were all writer-producer-performers on the show so I guess I would say, so why single out Mindy and not those gentlemen?\u201d\n\nGood question.", "description": "Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey spoke out about the controversy while Fischer made an excellent point.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa280e200000f813506235.jpeg?cache=a6wkybtevw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
