He can say, look, I made progress on some real significant things but I\u2019m still tougher than anyone else has ever been.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s purchases of US soybeans jumped in September after stagnating during the summer. This could offer some relief to American farms, which have borne the brunt retaliation in the trade war.\n\nWarning signs for the global economy have blared ever louder in recent weeks, however, increasing the pressure on both sides to reach a deal.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund this week said the trade war was due to shave nearly $700 billion from global growth next year, with 90 percent of the world\u2019s nations now experiencing a \u201csynchronized slowdown.\u201d\n\nUS central bankers believe the trade war is raising the chances the United States could slip into recession, according to a readout released Wednesday from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve policy meeting.\n\nAmerican exports have weakened, manufacturing is now contracting and business investment has fallen off sharply due to uncertainty created by the trade war.\n\nAnd if that slump persists, layoffs could soon follow, eroding consumer spending and dragging growth down with it, according to the Fed\u2019s minutes.\n\n\u201cWe all know the next round of tariffs is going to hurt the United States as much or more than China,\u201d Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told AFP on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think neither side will admit it but I think they\u2019re both under pressure to find a way to forestall the next set of tariff increases,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cEvery month that these trade talks continue, there\u2019s more and more friction in the relationship.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 As they prepared to return to the negotiating table on Thursday, top Chinese trade officials faced a blitz of aggressive US", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/82df85_donald-trump-meets-china-vice-premier-liu-he-in-2019-acrimony-low-expectations-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
