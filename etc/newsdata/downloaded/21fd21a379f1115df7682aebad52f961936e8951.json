They came in and told me I might have two wombs, and referred me to hospital,\" Rowe told Unilad, adding that up to that point, she had no idea that her body \"had a duplication of everything\" because the additonal organs were all internal.\n\n\"I thought, how could I have gone through life and not know?... Externally everything seemed normal, with one vagina leading to one cervix leading to one of the wombs. But inside I had a duplication of everything.\"\n\nThe scan confirmed that Rowe had been born with uterus didelphys, one of seven types of documented uterine anomalies diagnosed in only 2% -3% of women.\n\nDeciding to undergo corrective surgery in 2015, Rowe was warned that she had a 90% chance of miscarriage.\n\n\"When I was having surgery, the doctors said the walls of my wombs were so thick I would be unlikely to carry children. They said getting a baby to full termination would be a process and that every time I would get pregnant, it would help to stretch out the womb... [but] there was a 90 per cent chance I would miscarry. That was horrific to hear.\"\n\n\"It had really hit home\"\n\nThe medical prediction eventually became a reality when in 2018, Rowe had miscarried her first child with new husband, Chris.\n\n\"Even though I had been warned about the difficulties I would face, it was still devastating. But this was the first time it had really hit home,\" she recalled.\n\nBut the couple's sadness was soon replaced with joy as the two learned of their second pregnancy.\n\n\"I just want to give other women a bit of hope\"\n\n\"The timing was quite weird. I was [still] mourning the loss of my first baby... It was like we had been given a gift. We said goodbye to one baby, and another one came to us.\"\n\nBut the journey was not an easy one and Rowe's second pregnancy was immediately regarded as high risk, one that included an obstetric cholestasis diagnosis - a condition that if not carefully monitored could've resulted in the death of her unborn baby.\n\nDespite the potential danger, and an early C-section delivery at 35 weeks, the determined Rowe gave birth to a healthy baby girl she named Imogen Rose.\n\nThe happy mom is now using her story to inspire others to keep believing even under the most unlikely of circumstances.\n\n\"Any fertility issue is an extraordinarily hard thing to go through, but even with my condition, there was a happy ending. I just want to give other women a bit of hope.\"\n\nChat back:\n\nHave you or do you know anyone who has experienced something this amazing? Share your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
