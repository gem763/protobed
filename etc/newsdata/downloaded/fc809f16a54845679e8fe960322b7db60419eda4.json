The same design language was then carried down to the entry-level MT-15 in India, which also turned out to be a huge success for the brand. Now Yamaha intends to keep the ball rolling with the introduction of the 2020 MT-03 overseas. It\u2019s priced at $ 4,599 (approx. 3.26 lakh), an increment of $100 over the outgoing model.\n\nSo, are the updates restricted to a minor wardrobe change, or is it really a big step up over the 2018 model? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nSleeker and meaner than before:\n\nThe 2020 Yamaha MT-03 looks quite similar to the MT-15. It features an aggressive new front fascia running an LED projector headlamp flanked by position lights. The fuel tank and air scoops are sleeker than before and have a mass-forward design that amplifies the MT DNA. It also comes equipped with LED turn indicators. That said, the tail section remains unchanged, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing when you take pillion comfort into account.\n\nGets a new full-digital instrument console:\n\nThe 2020 MT-03 features a new negative LCD display which reads out two tripmeters, an odometer, a gear position indicator and a fuel gauge, amongst others.\n\nRevised riding posture:\n\nThe ergonomics have been revised as well according to Yamaha. The handlebars have been raised and the seat lowered, which makes for a comfortable riding posture. Furthermore, the new fuel tank design allows riders to grip the bike better with their thighs. And better grip over the bike should ideally result in better feedback.\n\nUpdated mechanicals:\n\nUpdates extend to the bike\u2019s suspension setup as well. The 37mm front fork, for instance, is all-new, and the monoshock settings have been tweaked for a sportier ride. The 2020 MT-03 also gets a longer swingarm (573mm) for better stability.\n\nPowertrain and brakes:\n\nThe new MT-03 retains the exact same 321cc, liquid-cooled parallel-twin motor that powers the YZF-R3. It produces 42PS and 29.6Nm, mated to a 6-speed transmission. It also misses out on a slipper clutch, a feature that\u2019s available on even the smaller MT-15. In this case, though, it may comply with Euro5 emissions, though we do not have any official confirmation of that from Yamaha. The braking setup also remains unchanged: a 298mm disc up front and 220mm rear disc paired with dual-channel ABS.", "description": "Here\u2019s a closer look at the 2020 Yamaha MT-03 and how different it is compared to the previous-gen model", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.zigcdn.com/media/content/2019/Oct/2020_yam_mt320_eu_mlnm4_act_007_03-71582_300x225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
