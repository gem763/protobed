(Image: Henrik Sahlstrom, Vice Press)\n\nFinding good collectibles for even the most recent pop culture properties can sometimes be a struggle \u2014 so if a show came out, say, over 50 years ago, things get exponentially tougher. Which is why Vice Press\u2019 new deal to release merchandise based on the work of Gerry Anderson is so exciting.\n\nAnderson was one of the most prolific television producers of his time, famous for his \u201csupermarionation\u201d puppet shows: wildly imaginative and technically advanced genre series like Fireball XL5, Stingray, and Captain Scarlet. But that was the 1960s and 1970s. Who remembers those properties?\n\nVice Press does, which is why it\u2019s making fine art posters and pins based on some of Anderson\u2019s most famous works, starting with Thunderbirds, which followed the adventures of International Rescue, a near-future service operated by the Tracy family, that battled everything from natural disaster to sinister crime syndicate the Hood; and Space: 1999, a sci-fi survival epic that followed the survivors of a moon base after a nuclear waste accident explosively catapults the moon out of Earth\u2019s orbit and into the unknown.\n\nAll of the below will go on sale September 30 at Vice Press\u2019s website, but we're excited to reveal them now.\n\nThunderbirds, a 50 x 70 cm fine art print, in an edition of 175.
