His decision means that international leaders will be left wondering whether, at any moment, embarrassing details of a private phone call with the American president could be leaked for political gain.\n\n\u201cThis is a big mistake \u2014 terrible precedent, as no foreign leaders in [the] future will speak candidly with the president on any future calls,\u201d tweeted Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia under the Obama administration. \u201cPresidents need to have the right to conduct diplomacy privately.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all: impeachment 2.0 is a veritable minefield of diplomatic disasters. Ukraine is a small country, very much in need of aid in its fight against its neighbor Russia, and extremely leveraged by U.S. demands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ukraine story paints a deeply troubling picture of information security within Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2014even more so because details of his private phone calls with Mexico and Australia were also leaked two years ago. In that case, The Washington Post published the leaks over White House objections. This time, Trump himself authorized the release.\n\nAfter Trump released the memo, he trotted out Zelensky for an awkward press conference wherein he alleged that he\u2019d placed \u201cno pressure\u201d on the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nSeated across from Trump, Zelensky said the July call was a \u201cgood phone call\u201d and \u201cnormal,\u201d and that he discussed \u201cmany things.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d said Zelensky.\n\nBut the White House memo of the call paints a different picture. Zelensky flatters Trump, says he stayed at his hotel, and credits him with inspiring his \u201cServant of the People\u201d campaign. When Trump complains about the lack of aid from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Zelensky echoes him.\n\nThe comedian-turned-politician then asks to purchase more Javelin anti-tank missiles, which Ukraine desperately needs in its ongoing fight against Russian-backed separatists.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d Trump responds. He then requests investigations into cybersecurity company Crowdstrike and a Ukrainian prosecutor that Trump says failed to investigate Hunter Biden. At Trump\u2019s insistence, Zelensky agrees to work with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr on the investigation.\n\nWhile the details of the phone call are unlikely to hurt Zelensky\u2019s 71 percent approval rating in Ukraine, they do have the potential to damage the country in other significant ways. Ukraine relies on the support of France and Germany in its campaign for sanctions on Russia, and Zelensky\u2019s criticism could hurt his relationship with them.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why Zelensky made it clear he didn\u2019t think his conversation should have been released to the public.\n\n\u201cI think such things, such conversations between heads of independent states, they shouldn\u2019t be published,\u201d he told reporters at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for any assistance to Ukraine from our European leaders, from Ms. Merkel, from Mr. Macron, and from others,\u201d he said.\n\nZelensky\u2019s obsequiousness to Trump won\u2019t help him in negotiations with hostile leaders either. The fact that in the call Zelensky \u201clooks like a whipping boy\u201d will not make things easy for him when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Vitaly Sych, editor of the Ukrainian news magazine Novoye Vremya. More than anything, Zelensky sounds out of his depth, Sych told Politico. \u201cHe looks like a very weak negotiator. It\u2019s very tough for him, it\u2019s not his level. The only thing he did was agree with Trump.\u201d\n\nAt one point in the call, Zelensky tells Trump, \u201cyes, you are absolutely right. Not only 100 percent but actually 1,000 percent.\u201d\n\nSeveral passages of the memo are embarrassing to Zelensky, says Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta Center for Political Studies.\n\n\u201cIt will be a lesson for him what to say and not to say in the future,\u201d says Fesenko.\n\nFesenko\u2019s assessment underscores the chilling effect this will have on world leaders\u2019 ability to speak freely to the U.S., and to trust that their words will remain private.\n\nThis also holds true for the whistleblower and his complaint. How is it that a third party was able to access intimate details of the president\u2019s discussions with a foreign leader from White House officials? And how did details of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint make headlines before a congressional investigation was completed? These security lapses have long-term foreign policy implications.\n\nThat Trump only agreed to the phone call with Zelensky after the Ukrainian president agreed to discuss the corruption investigations only compounds the public image problem for Ukraine, and further damages the international reputation of the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,\u201d Serhiy Leshchenko, an anticorruption advocate and adviser to Zelensky, told ABC News. \u201cThis issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.\u201d\n\nThat Democrats were first to use Ukraine for help in U.S. elections does not ameliorate how toxic this is for both countries.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, boasted after meeting Zelensky in Kiev that he told the new Ukrainian leader U.S. aid was his country\u2019s \u201cmost important asset\u201d and if he cooperated with Guiliani\u2019s demands to investigate past corruption allegations, it would be viewed as election meddling and \u201cdisastrous for long-term U.S.-Ukraine relations.\u201d\n\nThis is the very epitome of the swamp. International aid is funded by taxpayers, and is presumably spent in support of U.S. foreign policy goals. It is not meant to be the plaything of venal politicians, a bargaining chip in partisan political maneuvers.\n\nUkraine depends on the U.S. in its fights with its powerful neighbor Russia, but \u201cwe are just small change in their games,\u201d a senior Ukrainian security official told Politico. There is real fear that Ukraine, like Russia before it, will become politically toxic in Washington.\n\nThus it is not surprising that State and Defense Department officials were reportedly angry over Giuliani\u2019s shadow Ukraine agenda. After the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine earlier this year, \u201cthe circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments\u2026key officials from these agencies\u201d had to piece together what Giuliani was up to by reading news reports, The Washington Post reports.\n\nAsked whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was \u201cunhappy\u201d with him, Giuliani responded, \u201cI\u2019m the legitimate whistleblower. I have uncovered corruption that this Washington swamp has been covering up effectively for years and his State Department, you know, asked me to do this. So Mike, if you\u2019re unhappy with me, I\u2019m sorry but I accomplished my mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea if he is unhappy with me or not,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m the president\u2019s lawyer!\u201d\n\nImagine what leaders in Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea think of all this. One thing is certain: a government full of officials unspooling in real time, publicly battling their competing agendas on the evening news, does not project a strong image to the world.\n\nBarbara Boland is The American Conservative\u2019s foreign policy and national security reporter.
