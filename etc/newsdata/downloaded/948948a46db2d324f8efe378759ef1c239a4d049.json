Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said drivers are targeted by the groups 'week in, week out'. He said: 'It's posed a massive issue to hauliers for years. Drivers are facing challenges from smugglers and from gangs continuously. 'They have to be very careful about where they park up, they have to be very careful about checking seals on their trailers to make sure nobody has broken in. 'There's a set of rules laid out by the Home Office to ensure that hauliers and drivers are checking to make sure they haven't got any migrants on board. This has been a long term issue.' Mr Burnett said several drivers have been attacked in recent weeks and one was 'woken in the early hours of the morning by gun shots'. Migrant gangs are 'very sophisticated' in how they go about accessing trailers, he explained. 'They'll cut holes through roofs, they'll pull doors back, they'll unbolt the doors and then re-bolt the doors.'\n\nBulgarian public broadcaster BNR, citing unnamed sources, said the truck, which has been registered in Bulgaria on June 19, 2017, had left the Balkan country the next day and has not returned since.\n\nIn May, the NCA said there had been 'increasing use of higher risk methods of clandestine entry' to the UK by organised immigration crime gangs who move people across borders illegally.\n\nIts annual national strategic assessment report said: 'These include the movement of migrants (including children) into the UK in containers, refrigerated HGVs and small boats, at a high risk to life of those migrants smuggled.'\n\nIn a separate annual report for 2018-19, it said the 'majority of clandestine attempts to enter the UK involve concealments in HGV and other motor vehicles from Calais, Zeebrugge or through the Eurotunnel'.\n\nThis came after it warned in April that crime gangs were attempting to smuggle migrants into the UK at 'less busy' ports after a clampdown in security at major ones.\n\nThe multi-million pound Project Invigor was launched in 2017 to tackle high-risk people smuggling.\n\nIt has been trying to gather intelligence in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as countries which would be passed through in transit to target and disrupt organised crime groups operating along the whole route.\n\nA document setting out the programme - which is expected to run until 2020 led by the NCA, working with the Home Office, Border Force, police, Crown Prosecution Service and EU law enforcement - said migrant smuggling was a 'multi-national business' and organised crime groups involved originate from all over the world, 'making billions of dollars per year'.\n\nFlowers are left today near the scene in Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays after the discovery\n\nThe exact scale of the problem is unknown and the NCA is yet to publish statistics on most of its work in this area.\n\nBut it does say the number of potential victims of human trafficking and modern slavery reported to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) - has continued to rise.\n\nThe NRM programme was set up to identify and support victims and may include those who came to the UK as a result of people smuggling, although investigators believe this could be a small percentage of the overall figure.\n\nThe figures may be able to give some idea of the scale of the problem but are not specific to people smuggling.\n\nIt comes after the Calais migrant crisis hit its peak in 2015 when hundreds of people were trying to get into the Eurotunnel terminal at Coquelles every night.", "description": "The National Crime Agency said the number of potential victims of human trafficking and modern slavery has continued to rise, with 6,993 cases in 2018 - up 36 per cent on 2017.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089954-0-image-a-87_1571844983749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
