The brand\u2019s co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Barry Beck will leave the company on Sept. 20 to pursue an undisclosed new venture. Beck\u2019s wife and co-founder Marla Beck will stay on through a transition period.\n\nBlueMercury was founded 20 years ago and acquired by Macy\u2019s in 2015 for a pretty penny of $210 million. Since then, the argument could be made Macy\u2019s hasn\u2019t done much to exploit the brand\u2019s cachet with consumers.\n\nThe products aren\u2019t featured prominently on Macy\u2019s website nor in most of its stores. Macy\u2019s has opened 20 or so BlueMercury shops inside its stores.\n\nBut for the most part, since 2015 Macy\u2019s has been too focused on closing underperforming department stores, selling real estate, cutting costs, keeping inventory lean and opening off-price shops in its stores. So who can blame the Beck\u2019s for wanting to wave goodbye to all that non-growth nonsense.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate because with the cosmetics industry experiencing a slowdown (thank you Ulta Beauty for that shoutout last month), experience like the Becks\u2019 is what is needed.\n\nMarla and Barry Beck, Bluemercury Founders, greet customers on January 13, 2016 at Bluemercury at Macy\u2019s Union Square in San Francisco, CA, Wednesday, January 13, 2016 in San Francisco, CA. (Sammy Dallal / AP Images for Macy's) More\n\nMacy\u2019s stock dove 5% on the news of Barry Beck\u2019s departure. And that is the correct market reaction \u2014 it\u2019s yet another bad look for a company that is stringing up major losses this year.\n\nThe department store retailer is fresh off a nasty second quarter earnings whiff in August and haircut to its full year guidance. Embarrassing. And despite Macy\u2019s executives discussing some $400 million to $550 million in cost savings at the widely watched Goldman Sachs retail conference earlier this month, the market has largely yawned.\n\nThe stock has flat-lined since Sept. 10, days removed from getting a boost from the latest cost-cutting promises. Macy\u2019s stock is down 44% year-to-date. Both reactions signal a lack of confidence in Macy\u2019s upcoming holiday season and longer term outlook.\n\nA struggling legacy department store\n\nA data dive on Macy\u2019s via the expansive Yahoo Finance platform unearths a host of stats that Macy\u2019s executives surely would rather not feast their eyes on. But they perfectly capture the story on Macy\u2019s as of today: that is one of a struggling legacy department store with high levels of debt \u2014 not an envious positions in the age of Amazon-led digital shopping\n\nSome of the lowlights include:\n\nMacy\u2019s market cap has shrunk to $4.85 billion currently from $8.1 billion on Jan. 31, 2019. On Jan. 31, 2015, Macy\u2019s market cap stood at a little over $22 billion.\n\nMacy\u2019s stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 5.3 times, down from 7.5 times as of Jan. 31, 2019. The S&P 500\u2019s forward price-to-earnings multiple is about 17.5 times currently.\n\nMacy\u2019s stock trades at a startling 19% discount to book value. Paging Warren Buffett.\n\nMacy\u2019s dividend yield stands at 8.6%, well in distressed company territory.\n\nBut hey, at least the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade is around the bend. Always a joyous occasion.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
