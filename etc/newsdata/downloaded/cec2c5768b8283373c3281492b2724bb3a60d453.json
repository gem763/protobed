(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics called childhood obesity an \"epidemic within an epidemic\" because today's children and teens are not likely to have the life expectancy of their parents.\n\nThe organization said in its latest policy statement, published Oct. 27 in the journal Pediatrics, that metabolic and bariatric surgery should be considered a safe option for those with severe obesity. Those children face lifelong risks of death associated with obesity\n\nThe organization also recommended that insurers pay for the surgery and follow-up care.\n\nLifestyle modification has showed some success for children with less serve forms of obesity. Few strategies have worked for teens and children trying to lose weight with more severe forms of obesity, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of at least 120% of the 95th percentile for age and sex.\n\nSurgery 'safe and effective'\n\nDr. Sarah Armstrong, executive committee member of the AAP Section on Obesity, said surgery needs to be a potentially life-saving option for youth that is afforded to adults.\n\n\"Children with severe obesity develop health problems earlier than those with lesser degrees of obesity, including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, and sleep apnea,\" Armstrong said in a news release.\n\nThe last 10 years have shown that weight-loss surgery is \"safe and effective\" when performed in high-quality centers. \"Unfortunately, we see significant disparities in which patients have access to bariatric surgery,\" she said. \"Surgery needs to be an option for all qualifying patients, regardless of race, ethnicity or income.\"\n\nChildren, teens denied coverage\n\nA Harvard study predicted that more than than half of U.S. children and teens today will be obese by the time they turn 35.\n\nInsurance companies deny kids weight-loss surgery when they meet all the criteria of adults. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe umbrella term of bariatric surgery refers to a type of surgery that constricts the stomach or digestive system to limit calorie intake, leading to weight loss.\n\nBut insurance companies don't approve children and teens at the same rate they approve the procedure for adults, the AAP study found.\n\nThe AAP policy statement referred to a Teen-LABS study that found that 47% of young patients who met the criteria for surgery were denied coverage. Being younger than 18 was the most cited reason.\n\nIn contrast, adults who met surgical criteria obtained insurance coverage 85% of the time.\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/27/insurers-should-pay-kids-weight-loss-surgery-aap-study-says/2480118001/", "description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics said that weight-loss surgeries should be considered safe for youth, and that insurers should cover the procedure.", "authors": ["Sonja Haller", "Published P.M.
