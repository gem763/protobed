The new sign, which will be placed at the spot where the 14-year-old's body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River, will be open to the public but protected by a gate and security cameras, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission said. Till, 14, was tortured and murdered in 1955. An all-white, all-male jury in Mississippi acquitted two white men accused of the slaying. The memorial sign has been targeted repeatedly by vandals since it was first erected in 2008.\n\nPhoto stirs outrage: Students pose in front of bullet-riddled sign\n\nAOC to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2020 Democratic presidential primary\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., plans to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and appear with him at an event this weekend. Nina Turner, a former state senator and current Sanders campaign national co-chair, said that Ocasio-Cortez was returning the favor for the groundwork Sanders' campaign had laid in 2016. Sanders promoted the rally, which will take place in Queens, New York, during Tuesday's debate, along with the promise of a \"special guest.\" Ocasio-Cortez's district includes part of Queens, though the rally would take place right outside her district. The endorsement by the outspoken progressive could help the Sanders campaign, which has recently lagged in polls amid the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and questions about Sanders' health after he had a heart attack.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Bernie Sanders about her endorsement while he was still in the hospital\n\nIn rare session, British lawmakers to debate new Brexit deal\n\nThis weekend, British lawmakers will do something they have only done four times since the outbreak of World War II: Sit in the House of Commons on a Saturday.They will debate and then vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new deal to leave the European Union that won the backing of the bloc's leaders. If Johnson wins the vote, he will claim victory over a Brexit process that led to the resignation of his two predecessors (David Cameron and Theresa May). But Johnson's ruling Conservative Party doesn't have a majority in Britain's 650-seat Parliament. In order to win support for his Brexit deal, he will be relying on votes from other parties and independent lawmakers \u2014 while his allies in Northern Ireland are opposed to a deal and the three main opposition parties have pledged to vote it down.The vote is expeted after mid-morning East Coast Time.", "description": "DESCRIPTIONS and more things to start your weekend.", "authors": ["Editors", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oTcgflZN2D79ermHH6Kk5A--~B/aD05NjA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/4f65b40f7bef6591a02d4ded7b07e303", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
