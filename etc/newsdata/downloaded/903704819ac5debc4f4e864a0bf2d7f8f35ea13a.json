On Tuesday, the White House said that it was ending all cooperation with the inquiry, an attempt to stem the political damage caused by a saga Mr Giuliani helped set in motion.\n\nOn Wednesday, two associates who helped on his Ukrainian inquiries were arrested trying to flee the US and charged with campaign finance violations. By the end of the week, Mr Giuliani was fending off speculation that he was in prosecutors\u2019 crosshairs, while Mr Trump distanced himself from the scandal.\n\nDonald Trump with Rudy Giuliani in new York in 2015 More\n\nSo it is a surprise when Mr Giuliani\u2019s call comes through, even though it is pre-arranged. He gives one caveat to his willingness to be grilled, saying the two arrested men are largely off limits, given \u201cattorney-client privilege\u201d.\n\nMr Giuliani, the former New York mayor turned arch Trump defender, begins by spelling out his familiar claims over Ukraine \u2013 the ones that ultimately, and inadvertently, led to impeachment.\n\nSince spring, he\u2019s been the leading promoter of the theory that Mr Biden, as vice president, lobbied to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the company that employed his son.\n\nThe drive, coming after years as a Trump acolyte, has seen Mr Giuliani\u2019s public persona morph from \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d, when he steered New York through the aftermath of 9/11, into something much more partisan.\n\nBut what of his motives. Surely it is not just a happy coincidence that Mr Biden is a leading candidate at the 2020 election? Is Mr Giuliani shouting about this now because it politically benefits the president?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally false! I started doing this before Biden was a candidate.\u201d He says it was only when some Ukrainians approached him with the information in November 2018 that he took it up. But that was only a year ago, when Biden was topping the polls and expected to run?\n\n\u201cThe reality is that you don\u2019t get shielded from being investigated because you\u2019re thinking about being president of the United States,\u201d Mr Giuliani says.\n\n\u201cI mean, everybody \u2026 would say they\u2019re thinking of being president of the United States and they couldn\u2019t be investigated. It\u2019s a point at which the thing becomes ridiculous.\u201d\n\nSo now they are after the legendary \u201ccrime buster\u201d and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nThroughout the interview, Mr Giuliani keeps returning to his Biden allegations. Drawing from the Trump playbook, he calls Mr Biden \u201cdirty Joe\u201d and claiming the \u201ccorrupt\u201d media is showing double standards by not taking the claims more seriously.", "description": "As a man at the very heart of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment crisis, it should be no surprise that Rudy Giuliani can be a little prickly. \u201cI can talk about almost everything,\u201d he cheerily begins his interview with The Sunday Telegraph, the first with a British outlet since the scandal erupted.", "authors": ["Ben Riley-Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DRSqAyetvv09I9TSGwaTTQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/6ebbe8c6de577aefb7e8c6d2c8cebce1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
