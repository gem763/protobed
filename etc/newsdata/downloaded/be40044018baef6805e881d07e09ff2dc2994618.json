The Turkish military carried out the incursion together with allied Syrian rebels in an effort to seize areas to the south of the frontier towns.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier announced the start of the operation, code-named \u201cPeace Spring,\u201d on Twitter and said it would also target Islamic State. Russia, Iran and some top European officials urged Turkey to act with restraint. The conflict has sparked concerns that renewed chaos in Syria could lead to a jihadist resurgence and push the Kurds -- America\u2019s allies in the fight against IS -- into the arms of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTurkey has battled Kurdish separatists for years and had repeatedly warned it would not allow the creation of a Kurdish proto-state on its immediate border. Once it seizes the area, Turkey plans to resettle 2 million Syrian refugees, most of them Arabs, in the border zone, further complicating a combustible situation.\n\nA small forward group of Turkish forces first entered Syria early Wednesday at two points close to the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, according to a Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Turkish planes and shells pounded the towns as the incursion began. Residents fled though Kurdish forces had vacated positions before the attack, which is expected to involve tens of thousands of soldiers backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers from NATO\u2019s second-largest army.\n\nThe Turkish lira weakened as the conflict started.\n\nTurkey\u2019s advance followed a dramatic reversal of U.S. policy. Trump told Erdogan in a phone call on Sunday that dozens of American troops who\u2019d been working closely with Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State would pull back, effectively clearing the way for a Turkish incursion.\n\nAsked by reporters Wednesday at the White House what he\u2019d do if Erdogan wipes out the Kurds, Trump said: \u201cI will wipe out his economy if that happens,\u201d adding that he hopes the Turkish leader \u201cwill act rationally.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement Sunday appeared to surprise allies at home and abroad. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, normally a staunch Trump ally on Capitol Hill was among several Republicans angered by the move. He tweeted Wednesday: \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF said they would defend their \u201cown people,\u201d potentially relegating the battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG militia that forms the backbone of the SDF has been one of America\u2019s closest partners in the fight against Islamic State and is holding thousands of jihadist fighters and their families in camps and detention centers in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe head of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, wrote Trump on Wednesday and implored him to intervene.\n\n\u201cWe still hope that you will prevent the coming catastrophe against the Kurdish people and other peoples in the region as a result of the Turkish invasion,\u201d Abdi wrote in the letter, which praised earlier cooperation between the SDF and U.S. forces.\n\nWhile Trump said Turkey would become responsible for the detainees, who include foreign fighters from Europe, it was not clear if there was a mechanism in place to transfer them to Turkish custody. Trump was criticized at home for a decision that could see Islamic State fighters escape or regroup.\n\nAnalysts said a U.S. pullback could ultimately play into the hands of Russia, whose military intervention helped turn the tide of the Syrian civil war in favor of Assad. As the Turkish offensive got underway, the Associated Press reported that the YPG had asked Russia to mediate talks between them and the Assad government.\n\nTrump Whipsaws on Turkey as Threat Follows Green Light on Syria\n\nTurkey sees the YPG as a threat due to its link to the separatist PKK, another Kurdish group the Turkish government been battling for decades. It\u2019s considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Turkey launched a military ground incursion into northeastern Syria to force U.S.-backed Kurdish militants controlling the border area away from the region, the Defense Ministry said, after President Donald Trump ordered U.S. forces to stand aside.Turkish armored vehicles and tanks crossed", "authors": ["Onur Ant", "Selcan Hacaoglu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/brKq3JbMQLi7xHoe_2KnHw--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ce026804fafda4918816778e50aaf17d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
