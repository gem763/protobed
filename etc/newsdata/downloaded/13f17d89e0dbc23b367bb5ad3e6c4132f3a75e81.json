Soldiers of the regiment returned in May after serving nine months in Poland as part of an initiative to boost NATO's presence in the region.\n\nTuesday, investigators asked for tips from the public about a vehicle that might be connected to Bishop's killing.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing a white SUV in the area in the days leading up to the killing, and the vehicle was seen leaving the area the day Bishop died.\n\n\"We continue to work tirelessly and around the clock to bring the party, or parties, responsible for the murder of a U.S. soldier to justice and to provide the Bishop family with some form of closure,\" Guider said.\n\nSoldiers from the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment of the Tennessee Army National Guard regiment returned to the USA in May after serving nine months in Poland.

She recalled kissing Bishop after his plane landed in Tennessee and said she kissed him one last time before laying him to rest Monday.\n\n\"My children and I stood side by side with his blood relation and not (related), all united as a whole family to honor a man we all loved so dearly,\" Kindred wrote. \"This loss is unlike any. My heart is shattered and crumbles even more as I watch my boys cry and ask questions.\n\n\"They don\u2019t understand. None of us do. All we can do is stand united and push forward to keep this fight for justice for Jay going strong.\"\n\nInvestigators suspect Bishop's killing was not random but have not commented on a motive. They asked anyone with information to call the Loudon County Sheriff's Office at 865-986-4823.\n\nFollow Travis Dorman on Twitter @travdorman.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/soldier-home-deployment-found-bound-shot-death-sheriff-says/3916912002/", "description": "The mother of Jacob Bishop found him dead in his apartment after calling him and receiving no answer.", "authors": ["Travis Dorman", "Published A.M.
