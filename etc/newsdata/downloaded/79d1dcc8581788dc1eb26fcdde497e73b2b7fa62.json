It included wildfires in the West, hurricanes in the Southeast, and flooding in the Midwest.\n\nFarmers have had little help from the department when it comes to adjusting their planting practices to endure severe flooding or drought along with identifying regional risks from climate change.\n\nRead more: The Trump administration has reportedly buried reports warning that climate change will harm crops and cause health problems\n\nThe report noted that 2018 was one of the worst years for agriculture in decades \u2014 and the flooding rendered an astonishing 20 million acres unplantable, which is around the size of South Carolina.\n\nThe Agriculture Department's main vehicle to aid farmers are climate hubs that it launched around the country during the Obama administration. Politico reported they were operating with a skeleton staff, and top officials at the department have rarely discussed the climate threat.\n\n\"To say USDA does little to help farmers and ranchers is completely untrue,\" a department spokesperson told the news outlet, pushing back against the report.\n\nRead more: Scientists and economists are warning the world's governments that climate change will destroy capitalism as we know it\n\nThe agency during the Trump administration has significantly downplayed the risks of climate change. Earlier this summer, reports surfaced that it had buried a study indicating how rising temperatures, additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and unpredictable weather patterns would impact American farming.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, along with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, both have previously expressed skepticism and denied the threat of climate change. Back in 2014, Perdue wrote an article for the National Review saying that \"snowstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes have been around since the beginning of time, but now they want us to accept that all of it is the result of climate change.\"\n\nIn June, Perdue told CNN of climate change: \"I think it's weather patterns, frankly. They change...It rained yesterday. It's a nice, pretty day today. The climate does change in short increments and in long increments.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: A year after Armenia's 250,000-person revolution, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan explains what comes next for the country", "description": "The agency during the Trump administration has significantly downplayed the risks of climate change.
