Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., left, and former Vice President Joe Biden, right, speak Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston. (David J. Phillip)\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates did not hold back in their criticisms of President Trump at Thursday evening\u2019s debate, calling him a \u201cproblem,\u201d a man who sowed \u201chate and division\u201d and the \u201cmost dangerous president in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nBut even as the Democratic candidates drubbed their Republican rival, there were signs that they would continue the thrust of his signature foreign policy endeavor: the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nFor China\u2019s political leaders, that may be a worrying sign that even if the combative Trump leaves office in 2021, their trade relationship with the United States has been irrevocably changed.\n\nMost notably, while many criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the trade war, none of the candidates would say they would move to quickly repeal the wide-ranging tariffs Trump has put in place on Chinese imports. Some suggested that they would keep the tariffs in place for their own trade negotiations.\n\nAndrew Yang said he would not be \u201crepealing the tariffs immediately.\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he would have a strategy that would \u201cinclude the tariffs as leverage.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) did not dispute that she had supported steel tariffs, but said Trump\u2019s tariffs were too broad and hurt allies as well.\n\nKlobuchar and other candidates mostly took aim at the negative repercussions Trump\u2019s tariffs were having on Americans. \u201cHe has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego,\u201d said Kamala D. Harris. \u201cIt has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden, a favorite in some polls who had already taken part in the Obama administration\u2019s pivot to Asia while he was vice president between 2009 and 2017, said that it was either going to be the United States or China making policy in the future.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is, China \u2014 the problem isn\u2019t the trade deficit, the problem is they\u2019re stealing our intellectual property,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is they\u2019re violating the WTO [World Trade Organization]. They\u2019re dumping steel on us. That\u2019s a different issue than whether or not they\u2019re dumping agricultural products on us.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro appeared the most eager to negotiate with Beijing.\n\n\u201cSo when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war,\u201d he said, but added that the United States needed to do more to pressure China on its human rights record.\n\n\u201cWe have millions of Uighurs, for instance, in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated,\u201d said Castro, who is currently trailing with less than 0.5 percent support according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nUnlike other recent U.S. presidential elections, China looks likely to dominate the foreign policy debate ahead of the November 2020 vote. The Trump campaign has made its battle against China a key part of its platform, and China has already dominated the discussion of foreign policy in Democratic debates the way that terrorism did only a few years ago.\n\nIn a recent survey of candidates conducted by The Post, six candidates \u2014 including front-runners like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) \u2014 have said they would be open to maintaining heightened tariffs on China if elected.\n\nTen candidates did not give a clear response, including big hitters like Biden, Buttigieg and Harris. The four candidates who said they would not maintain tariffs have less 3.5 percent support in the most recent Post/ABC poll \u2014 combined.\n\nBeijing may take some solace in the knowledge that, as a whole, Democratic voters appear to oppose heightened tariffs. But polling also shows that views of China have turned sharply negative over the past year, with Pew finding a new high of 60 percent of Americans now have an unfavorable view of China.\n\nChina has weathered the trade war storm for more than a year now and though it has been bruising \u2014 and Trump\u2019s stance erratic \u2014 Beijing has begun to get a grasp on how to handle Trump. But while a Democratic president may be a more predictable negotiator than Trump, Thursday\u2019s debate suggested they may still drive a hard bargain.", "description": "Democrats slam Trump's trade war style, but they don't necessarily oppose tariffs.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6ySnJyDW-Lorth_xMk5OS-Fs-ZM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MIQERXGWB4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
