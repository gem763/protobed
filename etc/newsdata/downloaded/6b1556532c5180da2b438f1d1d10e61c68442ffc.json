Kardashian's tiny waist was achieved by wearing a super tight corset, which was designed by famed corset maker Mr Pearl months before the Met Gala. However, on the eve of the big event, West told Kardashian that her showing her body off was affecting his soul and his spirit as a married man and father.\n\nWest explained, \"The corset, underwear, all of that vibe, I just feel like I just went through this transition where, from being a rapper, like, looking at all these girls, and looking at my wife, like, oh, my girl needs to be just like the other girls, showing her body off, showing this, showing that. And I didn't realize that that was affecting, like, my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of, like, now what about to be four kids. A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?\"\n\nKardashian, who had been planning her custom Met Gala look for many months, immediately felt anxiety over her husband's last-minute disapproval. \"You knew last night I was having really bad anxiety, and I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me wearing a tight dress,\" Kardashian told West, who responded, \"You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.\" Kardashian then reminded her husband that it was him who built her up to be a sexy and confident person in the first place.\n\n\"You built me up to be, like, this sexy person and confident and all this stuff. And just because you're on a journey, and you're on your transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you,\" said Kardashian.\n\nFans agreed with Kardashian on this one, and they were glad that she clapped back.\n\nKim has been planning this Met look for 8 months. In the 11th hour Kanye decides to tell her he's not into her wearing tight clothes or a corset...and sexy pics of her makes him uncomfortable. #KUWTK pic.twitter.com/bx2u298SOB \u2014 King Natles (@natnatles) October 14, 2019\n\nIs anyone else watching #KUWTK livid that Kanye is making us defend Kim? What the hell what that?!? He's been pimping her out for years!!! Now he's righteous? pic.twitter.com/aFxfZP4NbC \u2014 Lisa Bon-ba\u00e9 (@missjasmine_g) October 14, 2019\n\nThis is a joke right? Kanye didn't want his wife to show her body which is what made her \"career?\"#KUWTK \u2014 me (@jumpset51) October 14, 2019\n\nLoool! So now Kanye suddenly thinks that because Kim is his wife she should be more conservative. Sir...you were the one egging her on to show her entire vagina for a magazine spread. Now it's too much? Good for Kim on checking him. #KUWTK \u2014 Freed (@Hello_Kitten118) October 14, 2019\n\nKim snapped on Kanye about her met dress \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc #KUWTK \u2014 Thee (@Alleycarlson) October 14, 2019\n\nWe don't often see Kimye fights on KUWTK, but we all know that West has a temper. So it wasn't too surprising that, in the end, the rapper stormed off as Kardashian stated, \"That's absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on E!\n\nCheck out Scott Disick calling his family trip with Kourtney and Sofia Richie \u2018a really hard and awkward situation\u2019:\n\nRead more from Yahoo!
