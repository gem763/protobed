I know all the supporters want to know something [more] but now is not the moment.\u2019\n\nThere remains an air of mystery about Ozil\u2019s absence from Emery\u2019s first team plans, with the manager refusing to explain why he is not involved.\n\nThe German was not given a chance in the Europa League on Thursday against Vitoria Guimaraes, and when questioned, Emery batted away the queries, saying: \u2018Tonight is not the day to speak about that. He\u2019s not in the squad. That is the decision tonight. Now we are going to work towards Sunday.\u2019\n\nFormer England midfielder Owen Hargreaves called for Arsenal to be more open about what the situation is, while Gunners legend Ian Wright admitted he does not know what the issue is, but hopes Ozil can get back into the starting XI.\n\nWhether he gets back into the team or not, Ozil has no intention of walking out on his mammoth contract with the club, with his contract running until 2021, which he signed last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I signed the new deal, I thought about it very carefully and said it was one of the most important decisions of my footballing career,\u2019 Ozil said in conversation with The Athletic. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to stay for just one or two more years, I wanted to commit my future to Arsenal and the club wanted me to do the same.\n\n\u2018You can go through difficult times, like this, but that is no reason to run away and I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m here until at least 2021.\u2019\n\nArsenal host Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon and Ozil is not expected to be involved once again.\n\nMORE: Ian Wright backs Mesut Ozil in ongoing battle with Arsenal manager Unai Emery\n\nMORE: Mesut Ozil ready to snub transfer and try to out-last Unai Emery at Arsenal", "description": "Unai Emery says that Mesut Ozil's exile from the Arsenal first team was not only his decision, but agreed with the higher-ups at the Emirates.
