Syrian migrant Mohammed M., 23, climbed over a security fence armed with an eight-inch-long knife and stormed the building while yelling \u201cFuck Israel!\u201d and \u201cAllah hu Akbar!\u201d before security guards pepper-sprayed him, Bild reports.\n\nPolice subsequently arrested the 23-year-old, but he was released the next day. According to a police spokesman, the local prosecutor did not consider the man was sincerely trying to hurt anyone, just trying to threaten them.\n\nAntisemitic Incidents Surge in Berlin with over 1,000 Cases in 2018 https://t.co/JlkO0VBep2 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2019\n\nBerlin defence lawyer Alexander Pabst expressed dismay as to why the Syrian was not assessed by a medical professional.\n\n\u201cIn addition, one could at least have a suspicion of a particularly serious breach of the peace, at least,\u201d Mr Pabst complained.\n\nOthers were far less generous in their assessment of the way authorities handled the incident. Gideon Joffe, chairman of the Jewish community in Berlin, labelled the event a failed terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cEspecially at this time, an attack on a Jewish institution in the middle of Berlin must be comprehensively investigated and punished with zero-tolerance measures,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in Berlin added.\n\nBild spoke to the father of the 23-year-old, who said his son suffered from mental issues.\n\n\u201cI do not know exactly what he has. But we are shocked when it was he who threatened policemen in Berlin. We absolutely have to ask him about it,\u201d he said.\n\nBerlin Antifa Assault Populist Jewish Youth at Holocaust Film Screening https://t.co/6aGwErj5zS \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 12, 2019\n\nBerlin has seen a surge in antisemitic attacks in recent years.
