It was the first time since 1928 that a player pulled off that trifecta of accomplishments.\n\nAnd that player was the immortal Ruth, considered to be one of the game\u2019s all-time greatest players.\n\nLorenzen\u2019s accomplishment in a single game certainly was historic, leading to inevitable comparisons with Ruth. One of the greatest home run hitters of all time, Ruth actually got his start in professional baseball as a pitcher before the ability that would make him \u2018The Sultan of Swat\u2019 eventually took him off the mound.\n\nWhen asked by the media after the game about his Ruthian feat, Lorenzen humorously made a comparison to the all-time slugger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It\u2019s a fun stat.

Lorenzen signed a contract this offseason with the Reds, paying him $1.95 million, double what Ruth was paid when accoounting for today\u2019s dollars.\n\nHis contract this year was a pay increase over last year\u2019s $1.312 million deal. Each contract over the past two seasons have been one year deals with the Reds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSo while his accomplishment is certainly Ruth-esque, his contract already had surpassed that of the Hall of Famer.
