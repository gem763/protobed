Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nWhen is Fury vs Wallin?\n\nThe heavyweight bout will take place on Saturday, 14 September with ring walks expected at approximately 4am on Sunday morning for UK viewers.\n\nWhere will the fight take place?\n\nThe fight is being staged at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The famous arena, which hosted both bouts between Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin, is expected to be full to its 18,000 seat capacity.\n\nWhere will I be able to watch the fight?\n\nThe fight is being broadcast live on BT Sports Box Office for UK viewers and will cost \u00a319.95.\n\nAll of Fury\u2019s bouts in the US are now exclusively broadcast by ESPN after the heavyweight signed a five-fight deal with the sports network worth around \u00a365m.\n\nHow can I get tickets?\n\nTickets are still available for the fight and can be purchased via axs.com.\n\nWho is Otto Wallin?\n\nThe Swedish southpaw enters the bout with a record that is at least impressive on the surface, having won all of his 20 fights with 13 ending before the final bell. However, upon closer examination, the level of those opponents has been extremely limited with only a points victory over unproven domestic rival Adrian Granat worthy of standing out.\n\nWallin does boast an imposing stature, standing at 6\u20196\u201d with a 78\u201d reach, however, he will still be the significantly smaller man in the ring.\n\nWhat have the fighters said?\n\nFury: \u201cAll these guys are bums compared to me. I\u2019m going to prove that time and time again. I\u2019m going to go down in history as the greatest heavyweight of all time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to have fun versus Wallin. It\u2019s Mexican Independence weekend, I\u2019m looking to fight like a Mexicano. I knew quite a bit about him because he\u2019s a former European heavyweight champion, and obviously England\u2019s based in Europe. He was a highly experienced amateur. He\u2019s a big guy, he\u2019s young, he\u2019s ambitious.\u201d\n\nWallin: \u201dI am fighting probably the best heavyweight out there, at least the best boxer. He is a big guy, uses his size well. He is very skilled and can do a lot of things in there.\n\n\u201cHe is tricky and has beaten good fighters but there are some things that people haven\u2019t done to him. I am really confident in myself and my work ethic. I have worked for a long time and dreamed of this moment. Now it is finally here and I have to try and grab it with both hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been at the elite level in fights but I have sparred big names and know I am at their level \u2013 Anthony Joshua, Kubrat Pulev, Adam Kownacki, Jarrell Miller, all different guys, and I know I am on this level.\u201d\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nTyson Fury \u2013 1/33\n\nOtto Wallin \u2013 12/1\n\nDraw \u2013 33/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nDespite Wallin\u2019s marketable resume, this fight is little more than a gimme for Fury, who boasts every possible advantage \u2013 size, power, technique \u2013 over his opponent. With an agreement in place for a money-spinning rematch against Deontay Wilder, there is barely even a faint prospect of an upset.\n\nWallin has never been tested at elite level and Fury should, in truth, be able to close the show whenever he fancies. A stoppage inside the first six rounds should be expected unless he decides to play to the crowd.", "description": "Tyson Fury makes his showcase return to Las Vegas on Mexican Independence\u00a0weekend, where the \u2018Gyspy King\u2019 will face undefeated Swedish contender Otto Wallin.
