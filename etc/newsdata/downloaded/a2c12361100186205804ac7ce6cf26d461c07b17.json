He still shot.\"\n\n\"Our first-born son was a peaceful and loving soul throughout all 32 years of his life. He was caring, helpful and gentle, never aggressive...to anybody at anytime,\" French's mother said at a press conference last month.\n\nKABC\n\nThe family was shopping in preparation for the upcoming Father's Day holiday the day French was killed.\n\nThe case was submitted to the grand jury on Sept. 9 and determined that no charges should be filed, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe DA said the case was taken to the grand jury after witnesses refused to cooperate with investigators and issued subpoenas to force them to testify before jurors.\n\nSanchez's injury to his head as a result of the confrontation with French was likely a key component in the decision not to indict, according to Hestrin.\n\n\"One of the pieces of information that I think was uncontroverted was that the off-duty officer was struck by Kenneth French ... and he went down as he was holding his infant child,\" Hestrin told a news conference. \"And it all happened very fast, about less than four seconds from the moment that [French] struck to the moment that [Sanchez] fired.\"\n\nSanchez believed there was an active shooter situation and reached behind his head to check for blood multiple times, witnesses testified.\n\nThe current status of Sanchez's role with the LAPD is unclear. The LAPD was conducting an internal investigation to determine if Sanchez followed department policies during the shooting.", "description": "A California grand jury has refused to indict an off-duty LAPD officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed man inside a Costco, officials announced.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/costco-ht-jpo-190615_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
