We Do the Math", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.\n\nEven if Boris Johnson can strike a Brexit deal with the European Union, does he have the numbers to get it past Parliament?\n\nThat hurdle tripped up his predecessor, Theresa May. While British negotiators haggled with their European Union counterparts this week, trying to hammer out an agreement, another set of talks took place in London. Members of Parliament have been going into Johnson\u2019s office to discuss whether they can support him.\n\nBut can it be done? Here\u2019s how the numbers stack up.\n\nTarget: 320\n\nOnce non-voting MPs are accounted for, Johnson needs 320 MPs on his side to win any vote in the House of Commons.\n\nBaseline: 259\n\nThe last time Theresa May tried to get her deal through, in March, she had the support of 279 Conservatives. They\u2019re mostly likely to back a Johnson deal too, but there are some problems.\n\nJohnson expelled a group of MPs from the party in September after they backed legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit. They were joined by Amber Rudd, who resigned in sympathy. Also out of the party is Nick Boles, who quit the Conservatives earlier this year in frustration at the Brexit deadlock.\n\nAs a result there are question marks against 19 former Tories who previously backed May\u2019s deal. On top of that number, one deal-backing Conservative, Chris Davies, lost his seat to a Liberal Democrat in a recall election.\n\nThat leaves Johnson 61 votes short. Where can he go?\n\n\u2018Gaukeward Squad\u2019: 19\n\nThe expelled Tories, who take their name from former Justice Secretary David Gauke, are temperamentally loyalists -- some had never voted against their party before September. Many of them are looking for a way back in. Given that their objection to Johnson\u2019s strategy was the fear he was pursuing a no-deal divorce, they may be happy to get back into line if he reaches an agreement.\n\nBut it\u2019s not certain. Gauke has questioned whether Johnson\u2019s promises can be trusted, while former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has warned of the economic dangers of not having a close relationship with the EU. Several of them, including Antoinette Sandbach, have suggested the U.K. needs to hold another referendum.\n\nJohnson would be doing very well if he got all of them on side.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party: 10\n\nJohnson has worked hard to try to keep Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP engaged. They have deep reservations about anything that creates any kind of border between Britain and Northern Ireland, and on Thursday morning said they could not support the deal in its current shape. But they also fear a no-deal Brexit, or Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. Backing a Johnson deal might yet conceivably be the least-worst option.\n\nThe DUP are the big prize, because they would unlock...\n\nThe Spartans: 28\n\nThe self-titled \u201cSpartans\u201d are Conservative MPs who refused to vote for May\u2019s deal. They chose their name to recall the fearsome Ancient Greek warriors who held off a numerically superior Persian force at the Battle of Thermopylae.\n\nWhen Johnson became prime minister, the Spartans were adamant they opposed any but the most minimal Brexit agreement. But in recent weeks they have begun to see the virtues of compromise. This is the result of the Benn Act, legislation that aims to prevent the U.K. leaving on Oct. 31 unless Johnson has reached a deal. It\u2019s made the Spartans fear losing Brexit altogether.\n\nThe leader of the Spartans, Steve Baker, said on Tuesday he was optimistic Johnson could reach a \u201ctolerable\u201d deal. But another, former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, was more critical. If the DUP are on board, most of the Spartans will fall into line. But even without the DUP, many are desperate to get Brexit over the line.\n\nTwo Spartans, at least, are fairly sure to back a deal: Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers are both in Johnson\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nLabour: 21\n\nMay pinned her hopes on winning the support of a significant minority of MPs from the opposition Labour Party who believe the 2016 referendum result must be honored.\n\nShe struggled to get more than five to vote with her, but 15 who didn\u2019t back her last time joined some who did in signing a letter this month urging the EU to do a deal. That might imply a commitment to actually vote for such an agreement. There\u2019s also Kate Hoey, a fierce supporter of Brexit, who\u2019s likely to vote the same way as the Spartans.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Even if Boris Johnson can strike a Brexit deal with the European Union, does he have the numbers to get it past Parliament?That hurdle tripped up his predecessor, Theresa May.
