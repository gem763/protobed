The pictures are good, the television footage dramatic. Brave words sound good, but soundbites don\u2019t bring down governments.\n\nCertainly not the Lebanese government, whose sectarian elites have been running their country in a cesspit of corruption ever since the French mandate decided after the First World War that Lebanon should be a sectarian country run by dividing Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shia in a mutual pact of patriotism, fear, jealousy and distrust. (The British, remember, did the same in Palestine, Cyprus \u2013 yes, and Northern Ireland too. The French did it in Syria.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just the old clich\u00e9 about \u201cdivide and rule\u201d. We Westerners have always been experts in our ability to be \u201cfair\u201d to minorities and majorities by setting them up opposite each other in exquisite love and suspicion. Look at America\u2019s creation of the Shia state of Iraq \u2013 we shall not mention Kurdish minorities at this point \u2013 yet for me, the most amazing thing about the latest Lebanese uprising is not the protest at WhatsApp taxes, unemployment and government theft, but that the Lebanese, in their small and wounded country, after all the bloodshed and failures and continued dictatorship of the 2011 revolutions in the Middle East, still believe they can fight and make a difference. There is courage for you.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI have always believed that it was the Lebanese, in their hundreds of thousands, who forced the Syrian army to leave Lebanon in 2005, after the murder of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, that led to the popular revolution in Iran against the crackpot president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (who almost out-Trumped Trump) and ultimately inspired Tunisians and Egyptians and all their fellow Arabs. This was the Lebanese supreme achievement in modern Middle East history \u2013 even if they may not know it themselves. They were the first to say \u201cno\u201d to power.\n\nThe Lebanese, in comparison to their Arab sisters and brothers, are far better educated. And thanks be to heaven that the Lebanese army is not the Egyptian or Iraqi army, shooting down their protestors and demonstrators in the streets of their cities.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And, if you move outside the Arab world, to the Iranians: who gave the Iranian security services permission to rape and execute opponents of Ahmadinejad in the country\u2019s prisons?\n\nBut then, what is our own \u201ccivilised\u201d example? What is the difference between a CIA torture \u201cblack site\u201d and an Egyptian interrogation centre?\n\nThe Lebanese army and their general security colleagues appear to be among the most unsectarian institutions in Lebanon \u2013 let us pray it stays that way \u2013 and act according to their state, rather than the statelets which their political leaders have created over decades.\n\nIndeed, one of the most extraordinary events of the past few days has not been the fury of the unemployed or those who found their WhatsApp voice would be taxed (which shows the asinine quality of the government), but those in southern and eastern Lebanon who, for the first time, were prepared to criticise and condemn Hezbollah.\n\nSayed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s chairman, suddenly found himself facing a Lebanese population of all religions asking why he did not defend the Lebanese people from poverty and distress. Were the Lebanese not as worthy of protection as the Syrians, for whom Hezballah have fought and died for years now? They did so with great courage, but is not an impoverished Lebanese population (whether they are Shia or Sunni or Christian) not as profoundly deserving of care and love as their neighbours?\n\nThe criticism of Nasrallah was unprecedented, incredible, as amazing as anything that has happened these past seven days in Lebanon. Or in the past 30 years. No one can expect any longer to be immune from a people\u2019s anger in Lebanon.\n\nSo, now, an important question. Political elites of any religion cling to power. Whether it is the Lebanese prime minister (a Sunni), the president (a Maronite), the speaker of parliament (a Shia). In different forms, this happens across the entire Middle East \u2013 including in Israel. Their claws are buried deep in the soft earth of the Levant, the sands of Iraq, the mountains of Algeria. They do not give up power.\n\nThey have lived by equating their ownership of property to patriotism; their religious faith to a section of people who share it with them. What so many protestors have said in Lebanon these past seven days \u2013 and many of these protestors have experienced life in the west, where we too have political elites but at least we can impeach them \u2013 is that political power in this region is maintained by telling their compatriots and party members that they are all protected by the state, but much more so if they vote for their sectarian leaders. That\u2019s how confessionalism works.\n\nWhy is the Lebanese foreign minister, Gibran Bassil \u2013 the most hated figure of these demonstrations \u2013 the son-in law of the president? Why is prime minister Saad Hariri the son of a previous prime minister, Rafiq Hariri? This goes on and on.\n\n(Why, you might also ask, is Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau the son of that nation\u2019s former prime minister, Pierre Trudeau? But they both won power through elections, not through cliques, and their job is not decided on whether they should have power on the grounds of their religious faith.)\n\nThere are honest ministers in Lebanon. The minister of labour, Camille Abu Sulieman, who honourably resigned from the government because of the protests, was independently so rich that he refused a salary. But, as a young man asked me yesterday, having just been dismissed from his job in the Hamra shopping district of Beirut because he attended the demonstrations, why is a politician succeeded by his son, and then by his son\u2019s son? And we all know the answer.\n\nI have long said that if you create a sectarian state, it will stay a sectarian state. No matter how many Crusader castles, Roman ruins and fine food you have in the Arabs world, the only way to create a modern state is to deconfessionalise it so that anyone can hold power.\n\nBut if you deconfessionalise Lebanon, it will cease to exist. Because sectarianism is the identity of Lebanon.\n\nSo we\u2019re back to the old problem. You can enjoy sitting in a Rolls Royce with green leather seats, but if it has square wheels it won\u2019t move. So watch the new version of the Lebanese revolution. And check on the Rolls Royce.", "description": "Burning tyres do not a revolution make. The pictures are good, the television footage dramatic.
