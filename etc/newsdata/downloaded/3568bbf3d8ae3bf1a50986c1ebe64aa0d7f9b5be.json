How much do you pay to live here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe pay \u00a3800 for a two-bed flat. my flatmate and I split it straight down the middle.\n\nBills are around \u00a3200 a month, my flatmate is a student so council tax is my burden to bear.\n\nWhat do you get for what you pay?\n\nTwo bedrooms, one bathroom, a super open hallway and weird downstairs space where we keep a bookcase, kitchen and living room \u2013 the living room is a total novelty because the last time we lived together we didn\u2019t have one.\n\nDo you think you have a good deal?\n\nYes. This was the tenth flat we viewed in the area and everything for the same price was super cramped or outdated \u2013 net curtains and damp? Nae thanks.\n\nWe\u2019re in an amazing location, the flat is really unique and the letting agent is on it when it comes to sorting stuff out.\n\nThe pair love the location of Leith, near Edinburgh (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow did you find the flat?\n\nWe\u2019ve been here three months. I\u2019ve just moved back after living in London for four years and Mairi, my flatmate, has just moved back to Edinburgh after a two-year stint in Berlin.\n\nWe originally weren\u2019t going to view this flat because the photos of it were awful \u2013 it looked tiny.\n\nAfter nine failed viewings we decided just to come along anyway because we were in the area and thank god we did.\n\nThere was another guy viewing the place while we were there but we became best pals with the agent and took it there and then. Sorry Michael, it\u2019s our house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you happy where you live?\n\nAbsolutely \u2013 Leith is such a hub of activity in the face of adversity. The food and drink scene is booming and independent businesses are constantly popping up despite student flats trying to take over.\n\nThere are businesses on the main stretch of Leith Walk that have been there for decades and its one of the few roads in Edinburgh you can grab furniture, scran and second-hand clothing in one go away from the centre.\n\nMairi and I have lived in different neighbours before but Leith is our best choice yet.\n\nAfter living in London for years I\u2019m still not over the fact that I can catch up with a mate in a pub ten minutes away from my house instead of arranging to meet somewhere an hour away for both of us \u2013 and that\u2019s before the cheaper pint price. London was crucial for my career but Edinburgh will always be home.\n\nArtwork made by their friends makes the flat feel like home (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nI mean this is probably biased as I have the bigger bedroom, but yes.\n\nWe\u2019ve got tonnes of storage, loads of cupboards and for the two of us this is perfect \u2013 even if I\u2019ve given myself a concussion on more than one occasion thanks to the sloped ceilings (which is no problem for my 5\u20194\u2033 flatmate).\n\nWhat\u2019s it like sharing a place with Mairi?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMairi and I have lived, worked and travelled together before and have been best pals of eight years so this is no bother \u2013 after four years of living in different countries it\u2019s the best feeling ever to be back together.\n\nShe\u2019ll kill me for being this much of a sap.\n\nHere\u2019s the hallway (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nAll of artwork has been created by our friends \u2013 we\u2019re lucky to be part of such a creative circle of pals (especially because I can\u2019t design for shit).\n\nAre there any issues with the flat you have to put up with?\n\nNeighbours, if you\u2019re reading this please stop playing guitar into the early hours of the morning \u2013 there\u2019s only so many times I can hear \u2018No Woman No Cry.\u2019\n\nDo you have any plans to move again?\n\nThis is us for now \u2013 Mairi is studying until next year and I have no desire to return to the big smoke \u2013 sorry Edinburgh, you\u2019re stuck with us.\n\nAnd have you thought about buying a place?\n\nHahahahahaha \u2013 I\u2019m a freelance journalist.\n\nWe\u2019ll take that as a no. Shall we have a look around?\n\nLook at that fancy staircase! (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDayna and Mairi\u2019s previous properties didn\u2019t have living rooms, so this is very exciting (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSpace for two sofas (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nEvery home needs a selection of candles and incense (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nNice clock (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nPoints for the organised storage (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe living room leads into the kitchen\u2026 watch out for that sloped ceiling (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSo much space (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSome neatly arranged spices (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe think they like whisky (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of those teapots (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nA nice window spot for eating breakfast or doing some work (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThis is Dayna\u2019s bedroom (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAgain, anyone tall would need to be careful of the sloped ceiling (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFeel free to read into this bedside book choice (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSpot the slippers (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhat\u2019s in that jar? (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSomeone likes her patterns and prints (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFinally, the bathroom (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nComplete with a shower (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhat I Rent is a weekly series that\u2019s out every Tuesday at 10am.
