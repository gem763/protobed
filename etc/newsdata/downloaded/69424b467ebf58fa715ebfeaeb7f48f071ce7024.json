I\u2019m a little bit familiar with it but it was alright.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t [think about my goal celebration]. Even if I did, I was just shocked at that moment. I\u2019m just thankful I got the goal and we got the win.\n\n\"[Lampard] told me the day before but I think it doesn\u2019t settle in until you\u2019re actually out there on the pitch. The atmosphere was buzzing, the stadium, everyone was jumping. When I was young, I supported the club and still do now.\n\n\"I probably looked up to Drogba, Terry, Lampard. They were the main three leaders. It helped drive the team back then when I was a little kid. They were all winners. That was reflected in the trophies they won.\"\n\nAs well as his goal James also provided two assists from right-back for team-mates Michy Batshuayi and Kurt Zouma to score against their League Two opponents.\n\nStory continues\n\nHis attacking capabilities stood out last season during a superb loan spell with Wigan Athletic, with his displays both at right-back and in central midfield earning him a place in the EFL Team of the Year for 2018-19.\n\nHe was one of 10 academy graduates to appear against Grimsby, with James among four players making their debut for the club as Lampard continues to turn to youth amid a transfer ban at the Premier League giants.\n\nAnd James admits that he was not expecting to get his chance so soon, particularly given the club's success under Maurizio Sarri last term.\n\n\"At the time I wasn\u2019t sure because the team did well last season, winning the Europa League,\" he said. \"I decided to take it as it comes really and when I found out I was staying, I was obviously happy. I\u2019m glad I'm getting my chance.\n\nReece James quote GFX\n\n\"If you look at the past few years there probably isn\u2019t as many who have played. Out there today there were four or five of us that got on the pitch. That\u2019s great for the academy. It shows the level and standard there is very good.\n\n\"Of course, looking at other young players getting a chance gives you a boost.\"\n\nJames has had to wait for his chance this season after he picked up an ankle injury in pre-season that required surgery.\n\nHe has gradually worked his way back to full fitness, and is now ready to continue his development and learn from the likes of club captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who plays in the same position.\n\n\"Of course I\u2019m learning every day because I\u2019ve not played at this level before. There are little bits here and there where they help me on the performance side and show me how it's done. Yeah, [I am learning] positioning, everything.\n\n\"Where to go where the ball is on the other side. There\u2019s loads of little things.\n\n\"I'm not sure what's going to happen in the weeks ahead. I have to take it as it comes. If I\u2019m involved, then I\u2019ll be happy, and if I'm not, I\u2019ll play again.\"", "description": "The defender marked his first appearance for the Blues first team with a goal against Grimsby Town and is keen to earn more opportunities", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lGQ7cCeV.HymWcZJrQ.54Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aeBclN3C0PQ_3g3Jm4UpEQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/af21cb47e854d46c52b5ed2c2a67da84", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
