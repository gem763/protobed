Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMs Patel was a vociferous opponent of the backstop when Theresa May was prime minister - voting against her deal three times - and took the same line as the DUP.\n\nBut pushed on the reported alternative, she said: \"We are working through that right now.\n\n\"I am not going to pre-empt any of the discussions right now in terms of acceptability [of that plan].\"\n\nThe home secretary added: \"We are in different territory right now. There's no point arguing about the past.\n\n\"We are moving forward now... as a government, collectively focussed on leaving but leaving with a deal.\"", "description": "The home secretary says the \"entire machinery of government\" is focused on getting a deal with the EU.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ndr83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
