By the end of the programme in March 2020, these selected teams will demonstrate their solutions and present the outcomes of their pilots to industry stakeholders and potential investors.\n\nThe solutions proposed by the cohort have potential to improve productivity, visitor engagement, and enhance the overall visitor experience, said STB.\n\nTwo Singapore firms, Infinito and Good for Food, are part of the first cohort.\n\nInfinito uses artificial intelligence to derive recommended hotel rates by \"learning\" from a hotel\u2019s previous decisions. It is able to determine which decisions maximised revenue, and then execute and implement pricing decisions and promotions on the hotel\u2019s behalf.\n\nIt also provides feedback to hotels on how future decision-making could be improved.\n\nGood for Food has invented a smart dustbin to help establishments such as hotels to reduce food waste. Using sensors and image recognition technology, these dustbins can track and identify food waste from buffet lines and restaurant kitchens, so that inventory can be managed more efficiently.\n\nThis could translate to a 30-40 per cent reduction in food waste, and cost savings of up to 8 per cent, said STB.\n\nSTB plans to recruit three more cohorts for its accelerator programme, with the next call for applications opening in November 2019.\n\nPoh Chi Chuan, STB's director for digital transformation, said: \"We are encouraged by the quality of ideas presented in the first round of recruitment, and will work closely with industry partners to test the solutions in a real-world setting, with tangible outcomes.\"", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Garage - THE Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has announced its accelerator's first cohort of nine companies which were chosen from a pool of more than 160 applicants. .
