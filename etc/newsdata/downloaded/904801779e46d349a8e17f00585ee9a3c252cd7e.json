The final season of Will and Grace will take over the slot on October 24, pushing its premiere up from early 2020.\n\nIn a statement to Vulture, NBC said, \u201cOur fall strategy was always to capitalize on the compatibility of both The Good Place and Sunnyside. We see huge opportunity for potential on the digital side for Sunnyside and want to move the show exclusivity [sic] to digital.\u201d\n\nSunnyside opened to middling reviews from critics and record low viewership for an NBC series premiere. The show will produce its planned season order, but its fate beyond the next seven episodes is unclear.
