But the coach had made his choice and you have to accept that,\u201d he told reporters afterwards.\n\nMbappe has been battling with a hamstring injury and has had little game time this season and coach Thomas Tuchel warned before hand he would not play for the entire 90 minutes of the match in Belgium.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show that it\u2019s hard to do without me. I want to fight to keep my place and help the team,\u201d Mbappe added.\n\nTime on the treatment table had not sat well with the World Cup winner.\n\n\u201cFootball is my passion, it\u2019s been two months that I could not play and I found that very frustrating. But I thank the medical staff, they took good care of me.\n\n\u201cI want to play every game, resume the pace and score goals. I want to go back to being 100%.\u201d\n\nBrugge will attest it did to take him long to show all the characteristics that make him one of the game\u2019s most exciting players, not least the lightning speed that saw him cut through the home defence, plus the deft touches to finish.\n\nHis hat trick came in 21 minutes as Brugge were blown away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary result, because I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s always very difficult to win a Champions League game,\u201d added Tuchel on the club\u2019s website (psg.fr).\n\n\u201cIt was hard until we scored the second goal. That gave us confidence and we won the ball back more. Kylian coming off the bench did us good, but we mustn\u2019t forget the work done for 60 minutes before that.\u201d\n\nPSG meet Brugge again in their next Champions League game, hosting them on Nov. 6.", "description": "After being left out of the starting line-up in the Champions League on Wednesday, Kylian Mbappe said he wanted to prove Paris St Germain would find it hard to do without him and showed as much by coming off the bench to bag a hat trick in a 5-0 away demolition of Club Brugge.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444006030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0EB", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
