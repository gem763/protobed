Delivering on the bottom line is critical for the startup and newly minted public company to keep existing investors and attract new ones, says two veteran strategists.\n\n\u201cSmileDirectClub is a show me the money story,\u201d Invesco global market strategist Brian Levitt said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye echoed Levitt\u2019s sentiment, adding the stock could stay under pressure near-term as investors grow comfortable with the thesis. Essaye does give SmileDirectClub credit for a business model people could understand, unlike the aforementioned Uber and Lyft.\n\nThe verdict is out thus far on how the early trading days will be for SmileDirectClub. Shares of the at-home retainer company fell 28% on their first day of trading on Thursday. The stock rebounded by about 10% on Friday.\n\nSmileDirectClub was founded in 2014 by one-time metal braces wearers \u2014 and longtime pals \u2014 Alex Fenkel and Jordan Katzman. Since its debut, SmileDirectClub has expanded into new products such as teeth whitening, overnight retailers and lip balm.\n\nRetailers are key\n\nIt has also launched in three countries besides the U.S., and inked deals with CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA) to open hundreds of shops in their stores. Co-founder Alex Fenkel tells Yahoo Finance he is particularly upbeat on the prospect to open close to 1,500 stores inside CVS over time.\n\nSmileDirectClub Chief Financial Officer Kyle Wailes said in an interview with Yahoo Finance the company is in talks with other retailers for similar relationships, which are critical in driving sustained profitability.\n\nThose expansion efforts have at least taken SmileDirectClub to the cusp of profitability unlike other hot IPOs this year such as Uber, Lyft and Slack (WORK).\n\nDental assistant Jessica Buendia looks at a scanned image of patient's teeth in SmileDirectClub's SmileShop located inside a CVS store Wednesday, April 24, 2019, in Downey, Calif.

But on an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis, the company eked out a $2.3 million profit versus a $8.5 million loss a year earlier.\n\nWailes stressed the company is laser focused on getting to profitability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out that our view on profitability is profitability today, we are profitable today. If you look at the fundamental unit economics in the business it starts with an 85% gross margin. For every liner we sell, there is a 30% contribution margin associated with that. So there are very, very strong unit economics in this business,\u201d Wailes said.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
