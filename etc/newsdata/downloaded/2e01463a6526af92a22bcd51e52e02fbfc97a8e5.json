The government has attempted to cut cryptocurrencies out of its pro-blockchain policy \u2013 a move that many critics say has led to great confusion.\n\nExperts would appear to believe that regulators would be more willing to listen to blockchain advocates\u2019 cause if their concerns about AML matters are met.\n\nThe media outlet quotes Oh as stating,\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work closely with regulators to address concerns about money laundering through [cryptocurrency] trading.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple (XRP) has made a \u201cmulti-million dollar\u201d investment in one of South Korea\u2019s top university blockchain research units, at the elite Korea University. The move is part of Ripple\u2019s University Blockchain Research Initiative. Per News1, the exact size of the investment has not been disclosed.\n\nKorea University is one of the country\u2019s traditional top three universities, and its blockchain unit is led by Lee Dong-hoon, considered by many in the nation to be one of South Korea\u2019s leading blockchain academics.", "description": "A group of blockchain advocates has made a fresh bid to change the South Korean government\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies \u2013 and has held talks with one of the country\u2019s top financial regulators.
