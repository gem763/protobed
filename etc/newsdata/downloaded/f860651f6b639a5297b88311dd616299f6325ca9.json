This will bring tremendous benefits, in the short-term with funding and in the long-term with expertise and support.\n\n\"It could not have come at a better time as we, along with Railway Paths, are starting on a project to turn it into an accessible walkway.\n\n\"We hope to attract people who might not otherwise engage with heritage and wildlife.\"\n\nIt is Grade II listed and one of only two such viaducts in England still surviving.
