At the moment only 2% of the archive is recorded digitally.\n\nHe also promised that the files would still be accessible to historians, journalists and former victims of the Stasi.\n\nHe said he aimed to make the documents \"fit for the future as we can tap the expertise, technology and resources under the roof of the Federal Archives\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many former citizens of East Germany have been able to check on what the secret police knew about them\n\n\"We are sending the message that on the 30th anniversary [of the fall of East Germany in 1990] we have this symbol of the peaceful revolution - that is, the access to the files and the possibility to use them - and that is something that we are securing permanently,\" he told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.\n\nHowever, critics fear that under federal control the archive will be less accessible and that the move is an attempt to draw a line under the communist regime.\n\nOne support group for former Stasi victims said it feared the oversight of the files could be subject to political whims and that potentially embarrassing information could be hushed up.\n\nWerner Schulz, a former regime critic and now a member of the Greens party in the European Parliament, said he feared that \"a lid will be put on history\".\n\nHistorian Hubertus Knabe also cautioned that Satsi files authority - the largest institution for dealing with East Germany's past - would no longer exist after 2021 when the transfer takes place.\n\n\"The signal being sent to many victims of the East German secret services is that the political establishment wants to draw a line under it,\" he told Bild newspaper.", "description": "Critics warn files on citizens of former East Germany could be less accessible if they are archived.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E1EE/production/_108983875_gettyimages-455597526.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
