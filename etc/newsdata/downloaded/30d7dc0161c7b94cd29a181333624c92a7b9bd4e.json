REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - Mediaset (MS.MI) had reached an agreement with an investor to facilitate its plan to create a pan-European platform, the company said on Thursday, in a move to offset any potential attempt to derail the deal from hostile shareholder Vivendi.\n\nEarlier this month Mediaset\u2019s shareholders backed a plan to create a pan-European media group, dubbed MediaforEurope (MFE), merging its Italian and Spanish businesses under a new Dutch holding, fending off opposition from its second biggest shareholder Vivendi (VIV.PA).\n\nBut Vivendi, locked in a legal battle with the Italian broadcaster, could still scupper the deal should it decide to exercise its right to withdraw.\n\nThe corporate overhaul is conditional on no more than 180 million euros being spent to mop up the shares of investors who head for the door - well below the value of Vivendi\u2019s 29% stake.\n\nMediaset said in a statement that investment firm Peninsula holding would, at the broadcaster\u2019s request, buy up to 355 million shares of the new MFE entity at a discount price to the withdrawal price.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the matter said that Peninsula intervention could entirely absorb Vivendi\u2019s decision to exercise the withdrawal.\n\nThe French conglomerate, which has not made clear its intentions, has until Sept.21 to make up its mind on the withdrawal.\n\nVivendi declined to comment.", "description": "Mediaset had reached an agreement with an investor to facilitate its plan to create a pan-European platform, the company said on Thursday, in a move to offset any potential attempt to derail the deal from hostile shareholder Vivendi.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431714062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1U6", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
