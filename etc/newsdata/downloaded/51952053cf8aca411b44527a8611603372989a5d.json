REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta has rejected the 2019/20 budget demanding that lawmakers remove a cap on commercial lending rates, a senior lawmaker and a local daily said on Thursday.\n\nIn 2016, the government limited rates banks can charge customers to four percentage points above the central bank\u2019s benchmark - currently 9% - saying they were concerned about high rates.\n\nIn late September, lawmakers rejected a June request by the Treasury to remove the caps, saying lenders had not proven they could be trusted to lower rates without pressure.\n\nThe Business Daily newspaper reported that Kenyatta had rejected the budget - known as the Finance Bill, over the rate cap, adding that the formal reasons would be sent to parliament later on Thursday.\n\nParliament will meet in the next two weeks to consider the president\u2019s recommendations on the bill, Adan Duale, parliament\u2019s majority leader told Reuters.\n\n\u201cTo overturn the president\u2019s position, two thirds of members of the house must be present and reject,\u201d Duale said.\n\nThe finance ministry says the cap has squeezed credit to the private sector as banks cut lending to customers deemed risky, including small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe central bank says the cap had probably cut 0.4% from 2017 economic growth.", "description": "Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has rejected the 2019/20 budget demanding that lawmakers remove a cap on commercial lending rates, a senior lawmaker and a local daily said on Thursday.", "authors": ["George Obulutsa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441774566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0HC-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
