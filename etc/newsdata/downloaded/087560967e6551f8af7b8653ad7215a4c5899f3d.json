The Biden campaign has just $8.9m cash on hand, raising new questions about the candidate\u2019s durability as a frontrunner.\n\nBiden is not alone in struggling for cash. California Senator Kamala Harris had only $10.5m at the ready. The New Jersey senator Cory Booker holds $4.2m, while the former Obama administration housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had just $672,000 cash on hand, and the Ohio representative Tim Ryan had $158,000.\n\nWarren and Sanders\u2019 commanding war chests will afford them the luxury of spending large amounts on advertising to boost campaigning in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nTheir pattern is one of raising money from thousands of small donors \u2013 as opposed to Biden\u2019s strategy of tapping larger political supporters at small private fundraising events that take him off the road.\n\nBiden has also been spending heavily \u2013 the $17.6m he spent over the past three months was more than the $15.7m he took in, according to fundraising figures submitted to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nSteve Westly, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Democratic donor, said: \u201cThe reality is this is quickly boiling down to a two-person race \u2013 and that\u2019s between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 hefty $21.5m in spending between July and the end of September topped the tables, while Warren\u2019s $18.6m in spending during that period allowed her to support a staff of 500.\n\nWarren came under sustained attack from her Democratic rivals during Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate, a reflection of the threat her ascendant candidacy poses to the crowded field of hopefuls competing to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 US election.\n\nTwelve Democratic candidates took to the stage in Westerville, Ohio, for the largest presidential primary debate in modern US history, and the first since the launch of an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nThe debate opened with a display of unity over the inquiry, with the Democrats unloading on the \u201ccriminal in the White House\u201d and \u201cthe most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had\u201d.\n\nWho won the Democratic debate? Our panelists' verdict Read more\n\nBiden, who has been dragged into the impeachment maelstrom by Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that he and his son were involved in wrongdoing in Ukraine, defended his conduct.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said, arguing that Trump\u2019s baseless attacks revealed the president\u2019s fear of running against him in a general election.\n\nBiden and Warren later clashed in tense moments during the fierce debate, the first since she surged into a virtual tie with the former vice-president in many Democratic opinion polls. And Warren found herself the target of barbs from other candidates, mainly moderates, over her leftwing positions on healthcare, taxes and regulating technology giants.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Biden: \u2018My son did nothing wrong.\u2019 Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe debate took place at Otterbein University in Westerville, near Columbus.\n\nTrump won Ohio by 8.5 percentage points in 2016, the widest margin of any \u201cswing\u201d state. The margin of victory in traditional battleground states is typically much closer, as it was in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three midwestern states that delivered Trump the White House.\n\nYounger Democratic candidates, including Buttigieg, 37, and Yang, 44, have argued it is time for new leadership in a Democratic party driven by the diverse grassroots energy of younger activists.\n\nSanders\u2019 health problems highlighted his age and that of the other top White House contenders \u2013 Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73 \u2013 in a race featuring a debate about a generational change in leadership.\n\nAddressing the question of age, Warren vowed to \u201coutwork and out-organize and outlast\u201d Trump or \u201cwhoever the Republicans get stuck with\u201d as a candidate for the November 2020 election. Biden said he was running in part because of his long record and experience. With age came wisdom, he said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee again will increase the fundraising and polling criteria to qualify for next month\u2019s debate in Georgia. So far, only eight of the 12 candidates participating in Ohio would qualify, according to a CNN analysis. Nineteen contenders remain in the Democratic race overall.", "description": "Figures released after Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate show Sanders has $33.5m cash on hand, with Warren on $25.7m and Biden just $8.9m", "authors": ["Edward Helmore", "Lauren Gambino", "Nathan Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/867b3bc14796f3f13bb6ce466bf65d14519b51d0/0_38_4285_2571/master/4285.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bde198ab771c05ae8032396aead88c0d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
