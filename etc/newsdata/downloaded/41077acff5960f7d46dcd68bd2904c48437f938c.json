That is more than twice as much as the company spent in 2016, at $842 million on advertising, and a significant jump of 65% from 2017, with $1.09 billion on advertising.\n\nThe company\u2019s marketing spend is actually accelerating at a faster pace than its content spend. The company spent $8.9 billion on content in 2017 and $12 billion on content in 2018, a 35% increase.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nAs Netflix spends more on original TV shows and movies like \u201dBird Box,\u201d the company realizes it needs to do more to help promote and differentiate those offerings. Given its worldwide presence, it has scaled its advertising efforts globally to highlight local offerings and propel global IP.\n\n\u201cWe have definitely leaned more into marketing ... As we create more and more of these titles that no one has heard of, we're going to need to lean a little bit more on promotion, and the website can't do it all,\u201d Netflix\u2019s then-CFO David Wells said last year on an earnings call.\n\nNetflix executives paint a streaming landscape with a variety of competitors. Some like YouTube are free and ad-supported. The company maintains that by remaining ad-free, it maintains goodwill among its subscribers.", "description": "Netflix Spent $1.8B On Advertising In 2018 - 02/04/2019", "authors": ["Alex Weprin"], "top_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2018/08/01/netflix_uhG3WHr.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-01"}
