Mobility made it possible for animals to make an unmistakable footprint on Earth, both literally and metaphorically,\u201d said lead researcher Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geosciences with the Virginia Tech College of Science.\n\nThe animal that made the latest prints would have looked like a millipede and was around a quarter of an inch wide and four inches long. It would have dragged its body across a muddy ocean floor and rested along the way, leaving a trail that is 23 inches long.\n\nIt would have been made up of 50 or more body segments, a back and belly, and head and tail, researchers say.\n\nThe find also marks what could be the first example of decision-making among animals. The trail suggests an effort to move towards or away from something, which indicates the animal could have had a sophisticated central nervous system.\n\n\u201cAnimals and particularly humans are movers and shakers on Earth. Their ability to shape the face of the planet is ultimately tied to the origin of animal motility,\u201d said Professor Xiao. \u201cWe are the most impactful animal on Earth. We make a huge footprint, not only from locomotion, but in many other and more impactful activities related to our ability to move.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We now have evidence that segmented animals were present and had gained an ability to move across the seafloor before the Cambrian, and more notably we can tie the actual trace-maker to the trace.\n\n\u201cSuch preservation is unusual and provides considerable insight into a major step in the evolution of animals.\u201d", "description": "The earliest trails ever made by an animal\u00a0have been discovered in China.\u00a0 The\u00a0fossilised remains and prints of Yilingia\u00a0spiciformis\u00a0\u2013 which translates as spiky\u00a0Yiling\u00a0bug - a\u00a0primitive animal that walked the Earth more than half a billion years ago, were\u00a0found in multiple layers of rock near the eastern city of Yiling.
