In 2016, they signed a deal which, as DeSanto claims in his lawsuit, gave him \u201cthe exclusive right to develop and exploit the Gygax IP in all media, including film, TV, video games, merchandising and licensing, either by himself or through third parties.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, DeSanto sued Gail Gygax for breach of contract. According to the suit, he claimed that she violated their agreement by moving to produce a video game with the company Fig based on the first dungeon that Gary Gygax had designed, Castle Greyhawk. He also claimed that she didn\u2019t have the rights to Gary Gygax\u2019s IP at all. For her part, Gail says she never meant to give DeSanto rights to Gary\u2019s whole library.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, my lawyers and I discovered troubling facts about the Estate which prevented me from executing my plans for the Estate,\u201d said DeSanto in a comment to Kotaku. \u201cThe dismissal was without prejudice and the interest in the Estate I negotiated for is still on the record. I remain and will always be a great admirer of Gary Gyxax and mindful of his legacy as an icon in the gaming world.\u201d Gail Gygax did not immediately respond to Kotaku\u2019s request for comment.\n\nKotaku profiled Gail Gygax earlier this year. DeSanto\u2019s lawsuit is the fifth she has battled since her husband passed.", "description": "Hollywood producer Tom DeSanto has dismissed his $US30 million ($44 million) lawsuit against Gail Gygax, the widow of Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax, Kotaku has learned....", "authors": ["Nathan Grayson", "Jason Schreier"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/riwb37fjqk5l8jhxm2p8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
