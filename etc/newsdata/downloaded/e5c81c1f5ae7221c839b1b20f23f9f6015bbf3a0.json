The U.S. higher education courseware business is expected to see a decline of between 8% to 12% in 2019, well below previous guidance of 0% to 5%.\n\nImperial Brands (LON: ) has seen its share price fall sharply after the company announced that it was cutting its revenue guidance on the back of concerns that the health problems now being expressed about vaping could result in a sharp slowdown in sales.\n\nIn August we heard early reports about a series of deaths from the 18-35 age group that may have been linked to vaping. These reports have now turned into a torrent and ultimately nixed attempts by Altria Group (NYSE: ) and Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE: ) to come back together after an 11-year separation.\n\nThe tobacco industry is now facing the prospect of an existential crisis, with a crackdown on normal cigarettes already cutting into its profits, e-cigarettes were supposed to be the next key growth area. This strategy now appears to be under threat after the U.S. threatened to ban e-cigarettes from the market, until the U.S. Food and Drug administration has done a more significant study. There is also the not insignificant threat that the sector could face which could send the sectors earning potential up in smoke.\n\nAlso falling British Airways owner IAG (LON: ) has warned that full year profits will be 6% lower than last year due to the disruption caused by the strikes by pilots, that caused widespread disruption to its business.\n\nOn the upside, JD Sports Fashion (LON: ) is higher, and approaching new record highs on the back of encouraging Q1 results from Nike Inc (NYSE: ) earlier this week, which showed that the company has continued to outperform despite concerns about a slowdown in China. JD Sports sells a lot of Nike goods and as such appears to be getting a decent read across as a result.\n\nU.S.\n\nInitial gains in the lead up to the U.S. open soon disappeared in the wake of the release of the whistle-blower manuscripts which alleged that White House officials tried to cover up the contents of the presidential conversation with the Ukraine president, as well as other key conversations, that might have breached national security guidelines. The weakness continued as director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire began testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, over the release of the documents.\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: ) shares have taken a trip higher after McDonald's said they would use the company\u2019s meat patties in Canada in an experimental burger in 28 restaurants in Ontario.\n\nOn the IPO front, Peloton (NASDAQ: )shares priced at $29 a share, at the upper end of expectations, giving it a valuation of $8.1 billion, nearly double its recent valuation, helping management raise over $1.2 billion, not too shabby for yet another loss-making unicorn.\n\nThe company may have over 1 million members and sold more than 400,000 bikes at $2,000 a pop but it still hasn\u2019t made a profit for more than three years. In 2018, revenue came in at $435 million while this year the company is on course to return $915 million, which is a nice increase. This can\u2019t obscure the fact that losses also grew well over $180 million. However, you add the numbers up, the company needs to sell an awful lot more bikes if its ever to break even, let alone make a profit. It will be interesting to find out whether investors agree when the shares start trading later today.\n\nOn the data front the latest U.S. weekly jobless claims showed an increase to 213,000 from 210,000, while the final iteration of U.S. Q2 GDP numbers came in unchanged at 2%.\n\nFX\n\nThe more positive outlook for risk has seen commodity currencies undergo a modest rebound, with the leading the way, though part of the reason for the outperformance in the kiwi is probably down to the fact that the RBNZ left interest rates unchanged, with the central bank saying that the it was unlikely that we might see further easings in the near future.\n\nThe also found itself moving higher in sympathy and ahead of a key rate decision itself, which comes out next week.\n\nThe has remained under pressure pushing back to its lowest levels in over two years, helped by a rebound in the U.S. dollar, and the resignation of a hawkish voice from the European Central Bank governing council Sabine Lautenschlaeger, reportedly over disagreements with the central banks overly dovish monetary policy.\n\nThe pound has traded in a fairly tight range today in the wake of yesterday\u2019s weakness and scenes in the House of Commons which saw MPs turn on each other in a manner that made for unsavoury viewing. If last night\u2019s events are any guide getting consensus for any kind of deal is going to be virtually impossible without a change of MPs, which means that in the absence of any consensus the options facing MPs now has narrowed to two, no deal, or an extension.\n\nCommodities\n\nprices are on the slide again over concerns about weak demand, and the prospect that Saudi supply will likely come back on line quicker than expected, after the attacks of earlier this month.\n\nprices are slightly higher after yesterday\u2019s sharp falls with the slightly stronger US dollar helping to keep a lid on it, however there is still strong support at the $1,480 level which has supported the yellow metal since early August.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Michael Hewson covering: EUR/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, FTSE 100.
