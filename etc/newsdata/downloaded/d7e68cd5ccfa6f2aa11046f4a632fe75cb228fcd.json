REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - Italy\u2019s Ferretti plans to bring on board a European private investor after abandoning a planned stock market flotation, the yachtmaker\u2019s chief executive said on Thursday.\n\nFerretti said it had decided to call off its initial public offering (IPO) because it could not get the right pricing, confirming what a source had earlier told Reuters.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see, in 2020 a new investor will come on board,\u201d Ferretti CEO Alberto Galassi told Reuters by telephone, adding the private investor could take a stake of around 30% and talks had been going on with them for some time.\n\nIt has been a challenging year for European IPOs, with investor sentiment battered by expectations of an economic slowdown as Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war take their toll.\n\nRecent failed attempts include Kazakh fintech Kaspi.kz\u2019s KSPI.KZ plan float in London, Germany\u2019s Domicil Real Estate AG and KKR\u2019s pulling of Latitude in Australia.\n\nGalassi said that while the IPO book was covered, meaning that there were sufficient investors to buy all the shares on offer, they would not pay a price reflecting Ferretti\u2019s value.\n\nU.S. investors were very few, he said, with the ongoing trade tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing not helping the listing of a company whose main shareholder is Chinese.\n\nFerretti, which used to trade on the Milan market before it was delisted in 2003, is 86% owned by Weichai Holding Group.", "description": "Italy's Ferretti plans to bring on board a European private investor after abandoning a planned stock market flotation, the yachtmaker's chief executive said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Elisa Anzolin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441905597&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1E9", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
