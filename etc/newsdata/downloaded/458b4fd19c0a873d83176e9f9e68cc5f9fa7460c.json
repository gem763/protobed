And just that element of uncertainty and ambiguity as to what the government's position is, in itself, damaging to the rule of law.\n\n\"The rule of law is essential as to what we are about as country, it is central to our institutions, and it is something which all ministers have a particular duty to uphold.\"", "description": "Johnson has retreated from threats to break a law forcing him to seek a Brexit delay in October if he is unable to secure a deal.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d761cb32e22af1182227412-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
