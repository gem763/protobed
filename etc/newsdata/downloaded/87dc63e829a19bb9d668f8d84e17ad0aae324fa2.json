The paid attendance on Sunday will go into the annals officially as 61,459 patrons, but there appeared to be far fewer actual living humans in the stands. You can understand why for a game between the surprising 49ers, who traveled three time zones, and the hapless Redskins in their first game after registering their first victory of the season.\n\nThe teams combined to run 103 plays \u2014 41 by the Redskins! \u2014 and 70 of them were either runs or sacks. That\u2019s how you get the clock to keep running. Another way is by having a game with only 12 incomplete passes.\n\nAdditionally, there were only nine penalties in the game. The league average entering Sunday of Week 7 was 14.8 combined per game, per nflpenalties.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth teams also had unused timeouts left in their pockets at game\u2019s end \u2014 a serious hat tip to the head coaches, Kyle Shanahan and Bill Callahan, for not extending the misery. Good work all around, everyone.\n\nHow short is this? Well, we had an overtime game between the Arizona Cardinals and Detroit Lions \u2014 a tie, no less \u2014 approach the four-hour mark in Week 1 (3:58) and one between the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers approach that four-hour threshold (3:51) in regulation. We\u2019ve had 15 games so far this season last more than three hours, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a Redskins fan, you can complain about the quality of the team\u2019s product. Or, if you\u2019re a bright-side person, maybe you realize that the pain was rather quick by NFL standards and a chance to dry off at home sooner than normal.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The 49ers-Redskins game wasn't really good ... but at least it was short!", "authors": ["Eric Edholm"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.jEhzJrEr3LZrSR_Ko2lRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gsG2WxmUV_qSRTUPsmwmCA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f93c8210-f37b-11e9-a7de-4bc8f8dd9fcb", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
