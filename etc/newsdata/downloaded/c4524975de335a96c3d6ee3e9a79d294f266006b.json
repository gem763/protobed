They decided it was the right time to move on and focus that show online \u2013 and also, in TV terms, to keep the whole focus on the main show.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: ITV / Thames / Syco)\n\n\" BGT \u2019s younger audience have a huge appetite for consuming content via digital platforms - clips of the show now reach millions of people so it\u2019s a no brainer for producers to make this move.\n\n\"The decision was nothing to do with Stephen, he is the heart and soul of BGMT and a much-loved member of the BGT family \u2013 and everyone loved him on the show. And he is, of course, still incredibly busy with lots of exciting projects for ITV.\"\n\nA BGT spokesperson said: \"As our 18-34 audience share continues to grow and viewing habits are changing, naturally we are listening to our viewers and focusing more on digital platforms in support of the main show.\"\n\nAnd fans are furious, with one tweeting: \"We cant let them takeaway Britain\u2019s got more talent we can\u2019t! I love the show,WE LOVE THE SHOW! These three are so funny,after every Britain\u2019s got talent show. love turning over to see Stephens cheeky face. also love the behind the scenes with the judges !Please tweet #saveBGMT.\"\n\nWhile another commented: So @StephenMulhern has been ditched from Britain\u2019s Got More Talent And Butlins next year because they want a younger audience. You kidding me. I\u2019m 26 I know I\u2019m not young young but loved him for years. \u2764\ufe0fThink big mistake. Think we should all protest.\"\n\nA third remarked: \"Have the @ITV bosses and @SimonCowell gone mad? They CAN'T get rid of BGMT !!! We love watching Stephen, the contestants and the celebrities on BGMT. It would be a GREAT MISTAKE to get rid of it. This does explain why there wasn't any Britain's Got More Talent The Champions tho.\"", "description": "The spin-off show, hosted by Stephen Mulhern, has been axed after 12 years", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Pa", "Itv", "Thames", "Syco"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541413.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-Got-Talent-auditions-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
