(Ashraf Hendricks, GroundUp)\n\nBy 09:00, the group grew to about 150 people, most of whom were children. Protesters burnt tyres and rubble to block traffic from entering the areas. Traffic officials and police were called to the M5 highway forcing officers to redirect traffic.\n\n\n\n\"This [protest] is the last resort,\" said Magadien Paulse from Parkwood.\n\nHe said he has been on the housing waiting list since 1994. Paulse shares a home with seven others. \"There is no space to move,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We need adequate housing for our community,\" said Oscar Samuels, a resident of Parkwood and Gatvol Capetonian member. He said that in overcrowded communities like Parkwood and Lavender Hill \"youngsters were killing one another\".\n\n\n\nSouth African Human Rights Commissioner Chris Nissen, who was there to observe, had to intervene when someone had a scuffle with officers who were helping motorists pass. The group dispersed by noon.\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, then Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela visited Parkwood during a land occupation.\n\nHe told residents that a \"lasting solution\" would be found.\n\nBut Parkwood erupted into chaos after shacks were demolished. Over a year later, residents say they are skeptical of the promises that were made.\n\nIn Kensington, about 60 people gathered from 05:30, blocking Voortrekker Road at 18th Avenue, while another group stood with placards at 5th Avenue.\n\nAt about 07:00, police fired rubber bullets and teargas at protesters who were stopping cars and trucks from passing.\n\nThe group then moved their protest onto the pavement.\n\n\n\nBackyarder Sadia Abdulaziz said: \"I rent a wendy house for R600 [per month] while the squatters are getting free electricity, and other basic needs. I earn R1 200.\"\n\nTwo women joined about 60 protesters in Kensington on Thursday. (Tariro Washinyira)\n\n\n\nShe has been on the city\u2019s database since 1998, she said. She lives with her three children and three grandchildren.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
