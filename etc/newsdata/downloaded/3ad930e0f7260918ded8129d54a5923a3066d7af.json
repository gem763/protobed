Gov. Justin Fairfax sues CBS over accuser interviews", "language": "en", "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has filed a $400 million lawsuit against CBS, alleging the company defamed him when it broadcast interviews with two women he says have falsely accused him of sexual assault.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in federal court Thursday alleges nobody at the company investigated or adequately fact-checked the allegations made by Meredith Watson or Vanessa Tyson before airing them. It says CBS\u2019 actions have damaged Fairfax\u2019s reputation and ability to earn a living.\n\n\u201cFairfax brings this action to restore his reputation and clear his name, ensure the truth prevails, stop the weaponization of false allegations of sexual assault against him, and vindicate his rights under civil law,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe Associated Press sent a request for comment to CBS.\n\nTyson and Watson leveled their accusations against Fairfax in February. Tyson says Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex in 2004. Watson says Fairfax raped her in 2000 when both were students at Duke University.\n\nFairfax has adamantly denied their allegations, saying the encounters were consensual and that the women\u2019s actions were politically motived.\n\nTyson and Watson made their allegations against Fairfax at a moment when he seemed poised to ascend to the governor\u2019s post. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam was facing numerous calls to resign after a racist photo showing a person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume was found on his medical school yearbook page.\n\n\u201cThe timing and circumstances of these false and salacious allegations demonstrate that it was a political hit job_a deliberate and calculated effort to permanently harm Fairfax\u2019s political and professional career and to attempt to prevent him from becoming Governor of Virginia,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Virginia Lt.
