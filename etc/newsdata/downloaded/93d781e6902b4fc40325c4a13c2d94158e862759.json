We've being hearing these generalities for three years, and they haven't led to anything,\" he said.\n\n- 'All of them to go' -\n\nJad al-Hajj, a mechanical engineering student, said he would also remain in the street after what he described as the president's \"meaningless\" speech.\n\n\"We want him to go and for this era to end -- for all of them to go, including him,\" he told AFP.\n\nMore than a quarter of Lebanon's population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nAlmost three decades since the end of Lebanon's civil war, political deadlock has stymied efforts to tackle mounting economic woes compounded by the eight-year civil war in neighbouring Syria.\n\nIn previous days, tens of thousands have gathered all over Lebanon, with largely peaceful rallies morphing into celebrations at night.\n\nBut in central Beirut's Martyrs' Square on Thursday, numbers were much lower than in previous days.\n\nThe British embassy in Beirut joined the United States in calling on Lebanese leaders to meet the \"legitimate\" frustrations of citizens.\n\n\"The necessary reforms should be implemented urgently,\" it said on Twitter.\n\n- 'Our basic rights' -\n\nIn his speech, Aoun said he respected the right of protesters to speak up but urged them to open up the roads.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, demonstrators blocked roads around the capital, AFP correspondents and Lebanese media reported.\n\nSitting on the pavement of a major east-west artery, a 30-year-old who had trained as a chef said he had been protesting since the first day.\n\n\"People think we're playing but we're actually asking for our most basic rights: water, food, electricity, healthcare, pensions, medicine, schooling,\" he said.\n\nBanks, schools and universities remained closed.\n\nThe president also echoed calls in the street to stamp out graft in Lebanon, which ranked 138 out of 180 in Transparency International's 2018 corruption index.\n\n\"Every person who stole public money should be held accountable but it is important their sect doesn't defend him blindly,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a state prosecutor charged former prime minister Najib Mikati over corruption allegations, in a move whose timing appeared as a nod to protesters.\n\nMikati, 63, along with his brother, his son and a Lebanese bank have been accused of \"illicit enrichment\" over allegations of wrongly receiving millions of dollars in subsidised housing loans.\n\nThe former premier denies the accusations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the army deployed in the streets, sparking fears of clashes.\n\nBut protesters faced the troops chanting \"peaceful, peaceful\" and a video of one soldier seemingly in tears was shared widely online.\n\nIn the southern Shiite-majority city of Nabatieh, police however tried to disperse protesters by force, leaving several injured, the National News Agency said.", "description": "Lebanon's president offered Thursday to meet the protesters whose week-old mobilisation demanding a complete overhaul of the political and sectarian system has brought the country to a standstill.
