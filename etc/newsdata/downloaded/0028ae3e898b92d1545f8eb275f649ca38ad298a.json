At least for one round.\n\nDodge\u2019s muscle car beat the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro in the third quarter of 2019, with a model-record 18,301 sold.\n\nFord moved 16,823 Mustangs while Chevy finished a distant third, delivering just 12,275 Camaros over the past three months.\n\nDodge pins the Challenger\u2019s success on its bold, retro-styling and the large range of models available, which runs from $29,590 to $79,440 and includes an all-wheel-drive version -- a unique offering in the segment. The Dodge Charger sedan had a similarly strong quarter, with sales of 26,060, its best in 13 years.\n\nThe brand also ran a \u201cPower Dollars\u201d program during the quarter that gave $10 cash back for each horsepower and was good for $2,920 on entry-level Challengers and $7,970 for the 797 hp Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye.\n\nThe Mustang still has a big lead in the year-long sales race, however. Its 55,365 sales followed by 46,699 Challengers and 36,791 Camaros. Along with coupes, the Mustang and Camaro are also available as convertibles.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "The Challenger has become the champ.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
