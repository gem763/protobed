It is estimated to cost \u00a3100m ($124.3m).\n\nREAD MORE: Thomas Cook is dead and 150,000 UK holidaymakers are stranded\n\nCAA chairwoman Dame Deirdre Hutton said in a follow-up interview to the BBC from the CAA\u2019s statement:\n\n\u201cWe ran 64 flights, we brought back just under 15,000 people. That was over 90% of those we intended to bring back, which is actually pretty good for a first day. But I\u2019m conscious that we\u2019ve got a huge job to do still because that\u2019s about 8% of the total \u2014 but a reasonable start.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were some operational problems and we\u2019ll continue to see those, so again I ask people to bear with us as we deal with the bumpiness of this,\u201d she added.\n\nThe sorry saga of the failure of Thomas Cook\n\nPeople are seen walking past a Thomas Cook branch in central London.

It was a pioneer of the package holiday \u2014 combining flights, accommodation, and sometimes other perks such as food into one bundle.\n\nBut, while more and more travel companies became online-only operators, Thomas Cook\u2019s business model still had costly overheads, such as 500 physical travel agencies.\n\nIt also ran up debts of \u00a31.2bn and made a first half loss of \u00a31.5bn as it battled a weak bookings market and asset writedowns and faced a cash crunch.\n\nThere were job cuts and store closures and the group put its airline business up for sale. It also blamed a heat-wave in northern Europe last summer, putting holidaymakers off last-minute deals, as well as Brexit and terrorist attacks in Tunisia.\n\nREAD MORE: Crying staff leave Thomas Cook HQ as company collapses\n\nAfter initially managing to secure an emergency takeover in August, in which it agreed to sell the majority of its tour operator business and a stake in its airline business to Fosun, it begged for another \u00a3200m in the last few days to help save the business. It was unsuccessful.\n\nWhat happens to the passengers?\n\nPassengers of British travel group Thomas Cook queue at Son Sant Joan airport in Palma de Mallorca on September 23, 2019.

Nearly 15,000 people have already been repatriated in the last day.\n\nThe CAA has all the information here on details of each flight. According to CAA figures, there have been 1.8 million unique visitors and 6.8 million page views to the dedicated website.\n\nThe ATOL scheme also covers those who booked package holidays: it will pay for your accommodation abroad and your flight home if the airline has ceased operating. It will also refund you for your holiday if it is booked for in the future.\n\nHowever, if you have only booked a flight, you will have to speak to your credit card company to gain a refund. You may also be covered by travel insurance.\n\nThe UK government also has a dedicated website for all affected holidaymakers.", "description": "The CAA and UK government are undertaking the biggest-ever peacetime repatriation of British people following the collapse of Thomas Cook.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IvdFVHPThTxyuWTjJc7tRQ--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/7867bbd0-de8d-11e9-a3ff-e9282a321e2c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
