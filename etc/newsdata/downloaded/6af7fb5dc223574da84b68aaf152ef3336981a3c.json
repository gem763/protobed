The case, according to The Times, is currently in pretrial hearings in Tuscon.\n\nZamora's attorney, Brad Roach, told the paper his client has pleaded not guilty to the accusations and \"looks forward to proving his innocence at trial.\" Insider has reached out to Roach for comment.\n\nZamora was a high-ranking official within the Border Patrol who rose up the ranks to become assistant chief in the Yuma sector. His wife, Gloria Chavez, is also one of the agency's most respected agents, recently appointed as interim chief of the El Paso region.\n\nAccording to court documents reviewed by The Times, the female agent, identified as R.W., planned to meet with Zamora on the night of the alleged assault because she considered him to be a mentor.\n\nBefore they met at a restaurant in Tucson, R.W. alleges Zamora asked her in a text message if she had \"dressed up\" for him.\n\nAs the night progressed, R.W. alleged that Zamora bought multiple rounds of tequila shots, before taking her back to his hotel room and sexually assaulting her.\n\nA pervasive issue\n\nborder patrol2 More\n\nPhoto by Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nZamora's case touches on what appears to be a widespread problem of sexual misconduct and discrimination within the agency.\n\nIn May, a Border Patrol agent was placed on administrative duties after being accused of sexually assaulting multiple women he met on dating apps. In February, Customs and Border Patrol doled out $125,000 to a teenage girl who said she was sexually assaulted by an officer while crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nAccording to a 2015 CBS News investigation, sexual misconduct within Customs and Border Protection is \"significantly\" higher than other federal law enforcement agencies, with more than 35 sexual misconduct cases against agents between 2012 and 2014. The Intercept revealed in 2018 that the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General received more than 1,200 complaints of sexual abuse against detainees between 2010 and 2017.\n\nAs noted by The Times, while Border Patrol has tried to recruit more women into the ranks, the agency has struggled to attract them to a male-dominated culture where only about 5% of 20,000 agents are women.\n\nJenn Budd, who served as a Border Patrol agent from 1995 to 2001, told The Times, \"there's not a single woman in the Border Patrol who has either not been sexually assaulted, outright raped, or at the very least sexually harassed.\"\n\nChilling allegations", "description": "A senior Border Patrol agent retired after being arrested and indicted on sexual assault and kidnapping charges against a female colleague.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vhZHSXXMAxQ.tkuqW0vjfQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/ad676762ffe69d63735919eb4d5a1bb2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
