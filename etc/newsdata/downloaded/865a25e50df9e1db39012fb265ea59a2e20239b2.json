(Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nMuch like taxes and death, hair loss is one of those things that we can\u2019t escape. It happens to everyone, men and women alike.\n\nAnd while it may seem far-fetched that a topical foam can help stop the loss and spark hair growth, there\u2019s one product out there that actually works. It\u2019s the answer to all our prayers: Yes, we\u2019re talking about Rogaine.\n\nIt sounds like one of those products that\u2019s too good to be true, but according to two doctors, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s been a best-seller for decades \u2014 and it all happened by accident.\n\nResearchers discovered\u2014 by accident\u2014 that minoxidil, the active ingredient in Rogaine, could help regrow hair. \u201cMinoxidil was originally studied for high blood pressure,\u201d Gary Goldenberg, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cDuring one study, it was discovered that some of the patients grew hair.\u201d Minoxidil was then turned into a solution and later a foam designed to be applied directly onto an area of hair loss, Goldenberg explains.\n\nHow does Rogaine work, exactly?\n\nThere are a few different ways that it works to combat hair loss, California dermatologist Cynthia Bailey, MD, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. In general, there are four key things it does:\n\nIt increases blood flow to the area where it\u2019s applied.\n\nIt stimulates resting hair follicles to switch them into the hair growth phase.\n\nIt elongates the growth phase before a hair follicle rests again, leading to longer hair.\n\nIt reverses the shrinkage process of hair follicles that parallels their progression from producing hair to no longer producing hair.\n\nWhile doctors know that this is what Rogaine does, \u201cthe exact mechanism of how minoxidil accomplishes this is uncertain,\u201d Bailey says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMen's Rogaine 5% Minoxidil Foam for Hair Regrowth, 3-month Supply.

When someone starts Rogaine also matters. \u201cPatients whose hair loss has progressed do worse,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to treat it as early as possible.\u201d Once you get past a certain point, \u201cnon-surgical options won\u2019t work \u2026 and hair transplant is the only option,\u201d Goldenberg says.\n\nHow do you use minoxidil and measure results?\n\nGoldenberg recommends looking for a formula that\u2019s five percent minoxidil (which Rogaine is). To use it, apply Rogaine to the area where hair is thinning or lost, twice a day. \u201cI have patients massage it down to their scalp skin with their fingertips, being certain to cover the entire area with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended dosage,\u201d Bailey says.", "description": "A topical foam that can grow new hair?
