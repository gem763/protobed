(Robert Falconer/The CW)\n\nTV critic\n\nGotham City, a nervous surveillance state, hasn\u2019t heard from Batman in years. Municipal leaders are ready to shut off the city\u2019s bat-signal klieg lights and rely instead on the crime-fighting services of a private security force called the Crows. There\u2019s a big news conference and party to celebrate the city\u2019s batless confidence, which, if you know anything about Gotham City, is just the right opportunity for a new villain to announce herself: the psychotic Alice (Rachel Skarsten) and her Wonderland henchmen in rabbit masks. Who will save Gotham now?\n\nBatwoman.\n\nWho? What?\n\nBatwoman. Don\u2019t you know? She\u2019s a lesbian, but that\u2019s not all she is \u2014 they say she\u2019s Jewish, too. Without getting nerdy about it, Batwoman is not Batgirl, that feisty, redheaded ancillary to the Batmans and Robins of yore.\n\nThe drab \u201cBatwoman,\u201d premiering Sunday on CW, is a thousand percent less groovy than Batgirl. Ruby Rose (\u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d) stars as Kate Kane, the cousin of Bruce Wayne. Kicked out of the police academy for a same-sex romance with another cadet named Sophie (Meagan Tandy), Kate ran off to some remote tundra, for one of those personal training boot camps with a mystical jujitsu instructor. She\u2019s returned to Gotham just in time to witness Alice\u2019s crime spree and try to rescue Sophie from captivity.\n\nKate also discovers the caverns behind cousin Bruce\u2019s dusty bookshelves, a techno-fortress wimpily guarded by Luke Fox (Camrus Johnson), the son of Lucius Fox, who was Wayne\u2019s business manager. Kate is no fan of Batman; she blames him for failing to rescue her twin sister and mother when their car plummeted off a bridge years ago. Only Kate survived. Rather than just give viewers this origin material in an efficient, don\u2019t-change-the-channel style, \u201cBatwoman\u201d metes it out with deliberate vagueness, more frustrating than foreshadowing.\n\nWhatever grudge Kate holds against Batman doesn\u2019t prevent her from raiding his closet and utilizing his toys. Gotham is left to wonder who this newer, shapelier Dark Knight is. \u201cI was running toward everything that didn\u2019t want me,\u201d Kate confesses in a lame voice-over. \u201cA military academy, a private army, my own father. I spent 15 years searching for a place I didn\u2019t fit. And I think I finally found it. \u2026 I see the freedom to be myself, to play by my own rules.\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019d love to offer \u201cBatwoman\u201d as the ideal antidote to the macho psychosis of Hollywood\u2019s new \u201cJoker\u201d movie, I\u2019m sorry to report that, despite her big talk, Batwoman is pretty much a nobody on the TV screen, a dud as both a vigilante crime-fighter and a ticked-off relative with unresolved grief issues. Mostly she\u2019s just another paint-by-numbers CW superhero, joining a collection of other, steadfastly rote shows (\u201cSupergirl,\u201d \u201cThe Flash,\u201d the soon-departing \u201cArrow\u201d) from executive producer Greg Berlanti (and, in \u201cBatwoman\u2019s\u201d case, writer Caroline Dries).\n\nWe all know there\u2019s a deficit of female superheroes. \u201cSupergirl,\u201d launched with such satisfying vim four years ago on CBS, migrated to CW, where it has fluttered and flattened out to almost nothing. \u201cBatwoman\u201d is a missed opportunity to take a character who is unfamiliar to pop-culture passersby (she\u2019s only been around in comic-book form since 2006, a relative newborn to the genre) and push her past whatever comic-book gender boundaries remain. Yet, when it comes to both expectation and example, this Batwoman feels disappointingly curtailed, as if she\u2019s holding something back.\n\n\u201cIf I were going to save you in a dramatic fashion,\u201d Kate tells Sophie, \u201cI would have dressed as Wonder Woman.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s what it would take to get things going, I\u2019m all for it.\n\nNancy Drew, meanwhile, has a far longer history and accumulated cachet than Batwoman. The fictional teenage sleuth with the titian blonde hair is coming up on her 90th birthday, and, like Barbie, she\u2019s endured a lot of makeovers and modernizing, launching a cottage industry in academia, which takes a particular interest in how she\u2019s portrayed and what she\u2019s meant to generations of young girls. (As a boy who preferred reading Nancy Drew mystery books over those dopey Hardy Boys, I guess I don\u2019t count.)\n\n\n\nKennedy McMann, right, plays Nancy Drew alongside Tunji Kasim as Ned Nickerson in \u201cNancy Drew.\u201d (Robert Falconer/The CW)\n\nAdapting Nancy to television and movies is a spotty business, strewn with attempts. Hardly a pilot season goes by, it seems, without someone pitching a revamped Nancy Drew series. And who recalls that the ABC series in the 1970s, supposedly alternating each week with a Hardy Boys mystery, was overcome by Shaun Cassidy fever? (If you do, wave your cane.)\n\n\u201cNancy Drew\u201d (premiering Oct. 9, also on CW) wipes the entire slate shockingly clean, primarily by making Nancy more impulsive and depressing. Producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (of \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and the \u201cDynasty\u201d reboot) and writer Noga Landau have given us a Nancy (Kennedy McMann) who lives in a seaside burg called Horseshoe Bay (whither River Heights?) and pretty much hates life.\n\nAfter the death of her mother, Nancy let her grades slide and blew off her college applications. Now she\u2019s taking a defiant gap year, working as a diner waitress and sneaking off to have quickie sex with Ned Nickerson (Tunji Kasim) at the auto garage where he works as a mechanic.\n\nEveryone you remember has been recast in a grittier guise: George Fan (Leah Lewis) is Nancy\u2019s boss and resents her for being a popular kid. Bess Marvin (Maddison Jaizani) is secretly living in a trailer. Nancy\u2019s attorney father, Carson (Scott Wolf), is hot-tempered and hiding something. Instead of seeming empowered and cool, the show is dreadful, putting far too much effort in giving Nancy and her world a darker edge. It\u2019s the \u201cRiverdale\u201d effect \u2014 once the Archies went to seed, everyone must follow.\n\nEven Nancy\u2019s amateur sleuthing skills are demeaned here and made difficult rather than delightful. Her intelligence and curiosity are seen by her father, friends and local law enforcement as an irritant; her courage has morphed into an overstated petulance. On top of that, the big mystery \u2014 stretched over two episodes, probably more \u2014 fails to register as a matter of ongoing interest: A bad guy\u2019s girlfriend is murdered while the town obsesses over the legendary ghost of a dead beauty queen.\n\nNancy\u2019s been around long enough to withstand this shoddy attempt to remold her. She could console Batwoman with the sisterly idea that franchise is forever, and malleability equals durability. If the story doesn\u2019t click this time, maybe the next version will.\n\nBatwoman (one hour) premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on CW.\n\nNancy Drew (one hour) premieres Wednesday, Oct. 9, at 9 p.m. on CW.", "description": "A new superheroine comes to Gotham, while a beloved teen detective morphs beyond recognition.", "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Tv Critic", "October At Pm", "Hank Stuever Has Been The Washington Post'S Tv Critic Since He Joined The Paper In As A Reporter For The Style Section", "Where He Covered Popular Culture."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OJu-c3g2Yu4T9U7jvv4c74bCOA4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJLKPRXF6QI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg"}
