Biden has a treasurer who has registered as a foreign agent.\n\nAccording to a report Tuesday in Politico, citing election filings posted online, Larry Rasky, is listed as the treasurer for the new pro-Biden group Unite the Country.\n\nMr. Rasky worked on Mr. Biden\u2019s two previous presidential bids and Politico reported that other Obama administration alumni are joining the super PAC.\n\nBut according to a report Tuesday in the Federalist, Mr. Rasky has been on the payroll of the government of Azerbaijan since almost exactly the time Mr. Biden announced he\u2019d run for the Democrats\u2019 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nOn April 19, the Atlantic reported that Mr. Biden would launch the next week, and the former vice president made a video announcement and held two campaign rallies April 24.\n\nRecords filed under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, the Federalist wrote, \u201cshow that Rasky was hired by the Azerbaijani government on April 23, 2019. Federal documents signed by Rasky show that he reports directly to Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\u201d\n\nThe contract says Mr. Rasky will receive $15,000 per month plus a 5% administrative fee for the subsequent six months, a period which would have ended last week.\n\nA separate August report in Politico said Mr. Rasky had explored going into business with the candidate\u2019s son Hunter Biden, who has come under considerable criticism in recent weeks for using his father\u2019s name to, among other things, get a lucrative position on a Ukrainian energy company\u2019s board despite having no discernible experience in the field.\n\nThe elder Mr. Biden bragged at a 2018 speech about threatening to withhold U.S. aid from Ukraine, a former Soviet republic like Azerbaijan, unless the company fired an anti-corruption prosecutor who says he was investigating that gas company.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
