Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake. He has some illusion tech. That's how he tricked you guys, and tricked me into giving him EDITH. It's a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.\n\nFURY: So all that death and destruction we witnessed was created by this?\n\nPETER: No, not just this. I think he's using drones.\n\nFURY: Well, if this is true, then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart. Who else did you tell about this? Parker? Parker!\n\nHILL: What's wrong?\n\nPETER: It's Beck. He's here.\n\nFURY: What? Hill?\n\nPETER: No, it's just an illu... Fury! Unh. Aah! [COUGHS]\n\nBECK: Wow, Peter, wow.\n\n[PETER COUGHING]\n\nBECK: I thought we were close. Fury always had to die, but not you.\n\nPETER: Stop hiding, Beck!\n\nBECK: I tried to help you walk away. Now you're making me do this. [ECHOING] You told me, you were just a kid. You told me, you wanted to run after that girl.\n\nMJ: Help me!\n\nPETER: MJ! Oh, God!\n\nMJ: Peter, what's going on?\n\nPETER: I know this isn't real.\n\nBECK: Do you, though?\n\n[MJ GASPING]\n\nPETER: MJ!\n\n[MJ SCREAMING]\n\nPETER: MJ!\n\n[PETER GROANS]\n\nBECK: I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

[YELLING]\n\nBECK: You need to wake up!\n\n[PETER GROANING]\n\n[PETER PANTING]\n\nBECK: I mean, look at yourself.\n\n[PETER GRUNTING]\n\nBECK: You are just a scared little kid in a sweat suit. I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in. I control the truth. Mysterio is the truth.\n\n[PETER SCREAMS]\n\nBECK: If you were good enough, maybe Tony would still be alive.\n\n[PETER YELLING]\n\nBECK: Deep down, you know I'm right.\n\n[CLANGS]\n\n[PETER GRUNTS]\n\nBECK: You made your choice. And all you had to do was step aside. And now you have...\n\n[GUNSHOT]\n\n[BECK GASPING]\n\n[SIRENS WAILING]\n\nPETER: Fury. Unh.\n\nFURY: Beck's people are trying to find everyone who could expose him. Who'd you tell?\n\nPETER: Um...\n\nFURY: I know you told someone...\n\nPETER: Um...\n\nFURY: ...so just tell me.\n\nPETER: Okay.\n\nFURY: Who did you tell? Who else did you tell?\n\nPETER: Just Ned and MJ from my class. Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it.\n\n[FURY LAUGHING]\n\nPETER: What?\n\nFURY: You are so gullible.\n\nPETER: What?\n\nFURY: You're smart as a whip. Just a...sucker. (TURNING INTO BECK) And now all your friends have to die.\n\nPETER: Oh, my God. [GASPING]\n\nBECK: It's easy to fool people when they're already fooling themselves. But for what it's worth, Peter, I really am sorry.\n\n[PETER GASPS]\n\nBECK: EDITH.\n\nEDITH: Yes, Quentin.\n\nBECK: Access files to Peter Parker's class trip. I need them to fly home from London.\n\n[PETER GRUNTING]\n\n[PETER PANTING]\n\n[PETER COUGHING]\n\n\uff08\u4e2d\u56fd\u65e5\u62a5\u7f51\u82f1\u8bed\u70b9\u6d25 \u9648\u4e39\u59ae \u7f16\u8f91\uff09", "description": "\u91cd\u751f\u7684\u8718\u86db\u4fa0\u5f7c\u5f97\u00b7\u5e15\u514b\u548c\u540c\u5b66\u4e00\u8d77\u53bb\u6b27\u6d32\u65c5\u6e38\uff0c\u5728\u5a01\u5c3c\u65af\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6c34\u602a\u548c\u82f1\u96c4\u201c\u795e\u79d8\u5ba2\u201d\u3002\u8718\u86db\u4fa0\u51b3\u5b9a\u548c\u795e\u79d8\u5ba2\u8054\u624b\u5b88\u62a4\u548c\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u662f\u2026\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/11/5da00c50a310cf3e97a0a4cb.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
