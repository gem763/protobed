I think that as the Republican Party, we have lost our way.\u201d\n\nSanford joins Joe Walsh, a former tea-party-backed, one-term congressman from Illinois, and Bill Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, as primary challengers to Trump.\n\n\u201cThis vanity project is going absolutely nowhere,\u201d said Drew McKissick, the South Carolina Republican Party chairman.\n\nSanford tweeted that he respects \u201cthe view of many Republican friends who have suggested that I not run, but I simply counter that competition makes us stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumbly I step forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 59-year-old Sanford has long been an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s, frequently questioning his motivations and qualifications during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election and calling Trump\u2019s candidacy \u201ca particularly tough pill to swallow.\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, Sanford said he would support Trump in the 2016 general election, although he had \u201cno stomach for his personal style and his penchant for regularly demeaning others,\u201d continuing a drumbeat that the then-candidate release his tax returns.\n\nAs Sanford sought reelection to his post representing South Carolina\u2019s 1st District in 2018, drawing a primary challenger who embraced Trump, the president took interest in the race. State Rep. Katie Arrington repeatedly aired ads featuring Sanford\u2019s on-air critiques of Trump and attached the \u201cNever Trump\u201d moniker to Sanford, a condemnation in a state that Trump carried by double digits in 2016.\n\nAlthough unlikely to have had a significant impact on the results, Trump endorsed Arrington just hours before the polls closed, tweeting that Sanford \u201chas been very unhelpful to me in my campaign\u201d and that \u201cHe is better off in Argentina\u201d \u2014 a reference to Sanford\u2019s secret 2009 rendezvous to South America for an extramarital affair while his in-the-dark gubernatorial staff told reporters he was hiking the Appalachian Trail.\n\nAsked Sunday if that incident could be a distraction to his campaign, Sanford said that the aftermath had forced him to attain a new \u201clevel of empathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI profoundly apologize for that,\u201d he added, noting that South Carolina voters subsequently forgave him politically and sent him back to Congress.\n\nDays after his first-ever political loss, Sanford described Trumpism as \u201ca cancerous growth,\u201d warning the GOP that the cancer is spreading.\n\n\u201cWe have a president that will tell numerous dis-truths in the course of a day, yet that\u2019s not challenged,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cWhat\u2019s cancerous here is in an open political system, there has to be some measure of objective truth.\u201d\n\nSanford won three terms for U.S. House in the 1990s, then two four-year terms as governor before the affair marred the end of his second term. He returned to politics a couple of years later and won a special election to his old U.S. House seat in 2013, holding on twice more.\n\nThroughout his political career, Sanford has played up his outsider credentials \u2014 both in the U.S. House, where he supported a box to check on federal tax returns to put $3 toward the national debt, and as governor, bringing a pair of squealing pigs to the state House and Senate chamber to protest what he call pork spending.\n\nAs the main focus of his presidential bid, Sanford has said he plans to zero in on holding down federal spending, an issue on which he has railed since his initial stint in the House. Known during his Capitol Hill years as a deficit hawk, Sanford expressed a determination to bring debt and fiscal restraint into the national conversation.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go out and try to force a conversation about that which is not being talked about in this country,\u201d Sanford said Sunday.\n\nSanford won\u2019t be able to compete in his home state of South Carolina, which on Saturday \u2014 along with Nevada and Kansas \u2014 announced it won\u2019t hold presidential nominating balloting in 2020, erecting more hurdles for the long shot candidates challenging Trump.\n\nSanford\u2019s possible presidential motivations immediately drew skepticism from a primary opponent and some South Carolina political observers who have watched him plot a political comeback before and questioned whether he was merely seeking publicity and relevance.\n\n\u201cThis is about Mark Sanford looking to raise his political career from the grave, not him wanting to advance ideas,\u201d said McKissick, the state party chairman.\n\nLast month, Sanford acknowledged his motivations in an interview with The Associated Press .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m saying, you know, I think I can become president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think you can change the debate, and you might even have an impact on the general election.\u201d\n\nWalsh said he welcomed Sanford\u2019s candidacy but questioned his commitment.\n\n\u201cHow the hell can you say \u2018I\u2019m going to primary the president of the United States, but I don\u2019t think I can win, it\u2019s not about winning\u2019?\u201d Walsh said in Manchester, New Hampshire. \u201cThat makes no sense to me. ... Why would you do this unless you really had a good reason?\u201d\n\nBut Weld, in a tweet, proclaimed himself \u201cso excited\u201d that Sanford, \u201can experienced and thoughtful fiscal conservative,\u201d was in the race.", "description": "Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor and congressman, joined the Republican race against President Donald Trump on Sunday, aiming to put his...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN507_Sanfor_ZG_20190717093255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
