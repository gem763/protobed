Midfielder Hojbjerg, who is unconcerned by the quality of \u00adopposition, believes talk is cheap and producing vastly improved performances is the only way to atone for the embarrassment.\u200b\n\n\u201cIf there is one saying it\u2019s, \u2018tough periods make tough people\u2019,\u201d said Hojbjerg, according to the Southern Daily Echo. \u201cI can try and say something, but it won\u2019t change anything. I don\u2019t want to speak, I want to show by action. I don\u2019t care who is coming up. Our actions have to speak. We never want to be in this position again or anywhere near it. We have to get back up and make sure this never happens again.\u200b", "description": "Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg says Southampton must show on the pitch they are truly sorry for the 9-0 humiliation by Leicester, starting with two trips to Manchester City.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Jim White", "Jason Burt", "Luke Edwards", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214146276-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoQmI6CCYeWXI2SDtPW01My4RXFC_7QpIJa3-H0Y5cQM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
