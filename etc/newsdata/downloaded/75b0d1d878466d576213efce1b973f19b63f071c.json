The chairman of the House oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties opened the hearing with a blast, saying, \u201cOil companies like Exxon knew the scientific reality of climate change 40 years ago but waged a war of deception that cost us precious time in the fight to save our planet.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, in New York City the company is facing off with the state attorney general\u2019s office in a shareholder fraud lawsuit four years in the making that alleges Exxon told investors it was fully accounting for the risks of climate regulation to its business while in practice it was seriously underestimating that risk. The trial is not about climate change denial directly, but instead hinges on New York\u2019s Martin Act, which gives the state broad powers to protect shareho lders from corporate fraud.\n\nThe trial started Tuesday and is expected to last three weeks.\n\nIn 2015 The New York Times broke the news that the New York Attorney General had launched a fraud investigation of Exxon Mobil. Our first article stated the investigation focused on \u201cwhether statements the company made to investors about climate risks as recently as this year were consistent with the company\u2019s own long-running scientific research.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday in Manhattan, I was in the courtroom when the case finally came to trial in New York State Supreme Court with opening statements before the presiding judge, Barry Ostrager. Protesters outside chanted \u201cExxon Knew!\u201d earlier in the day, but their fire was matched by Ted Wells Jr., a lawyer for the company, who suggested that discussion at a 2016 meeting among climate activists about portraying Exxon as \u201ca corrupt institution\u201d was part of a conspiracy to take down the company with a \u201cvilification agenda\u201d that he compared to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn the past few years, climate investigations and lawsuits and countersuits have sprawled. Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey pursued an investigation of her own; she is expected to file a lawsuit in coming days.", "description": "Also this week, Exxon Mobil goes to court.", "authors": ["Susan Shain", "John Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/climate/23cli-newsletter-onething/23cli-newsletter-onething-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
