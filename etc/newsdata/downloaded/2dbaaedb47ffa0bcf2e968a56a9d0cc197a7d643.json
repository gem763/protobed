REUTERS/Matthew Childs\n\nItaly\u2019s game against New Zealand in Toyota and England\u2019s match against France in Yokohama on Saturday have both been cancelled, while Sunday\u2019s key game between hosts Japan and Scotland is in doubt, with a decision to be made on the day.\n\nThe sport\u2019s governing body World Rugby and tournament officials said at a news conference on Thursday the decision had been taken due to the disruption expected from the typhoon, predicted to be one of the most violent to hit the region in recent years.\n\n\u201cWhile making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday\u2019s matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon,\u201d said Tournament Director Alan Gilpin.\n\n\u201cWe fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first.\u201d\n\nSuper typhoon Hagibis, which was swirling some 490 km (306 miles) south-southwest of Japan\u2019s Chichijima island as of 9:00 a.m. (0000 GMT), is heading north toward Japan\u2019s main island and could make landfall on Saturday.\n\nJapan Meteorological Agency said people should guard themselves against torrential rain, high winds, storm surges and high waves.\n\nTyphoon Faxai hit the Tokyo region on the eve of the tournament, with destructive winds of up to 216 kph (134 mph) causing transport chaos and power outages.\n\nNO REGRETS\n\nTournament Director Gilpin defended the decision to hold the tournament, the first to be held in Asia, at this time of the year.\n\n\u201cWe always knew there would be risks but it\u2019s rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year,\u201d he said, adding that he did not feel the integrity of the tournament had been compromised. \u201cWe have no regrets.\u201d\n\nTournament regulations state that cancelled games are ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points going to each team, which condemned Italy to third place in Pool B.\n\nThe Italians, who could have qualified for the quarter-finals with a shock win over double defending champions New Zealand, had been due to hold a news conference on Thursday to announce their team for the match but it has now been scrapped. Team officials have yet to comment on the match cancellation.\n\nNew Zealand finish top of the group with South Africa going through as runners up.\n\nWhile England and France were already assured of a spot in the quarter-finals the decision to cancel their game means Eddie Jones\u2019s side finish top of the group.\n\n\u201cOf course everyone is disappointed. We wanted to play against France but the situation is the situation and we can\u2019t control it,\u201d said Jones, who had been warning about the typhoon risk almost since he took over as England coach almost four years ago.\n\n\u201cAll we can think about now is preparing for the quarter-final and I think we will have an exceptional two weeks of preparation.\u201d\n\nIf Japan\u2019s game against Scotland falls victim to the typhoon the hosts would go into the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nJapan, who four years ago became the first team to fail to reach the knockout round after winning three pool games, would advance top of Pool A with Ireland likely to join them.\n\nThe Irish would need any sort of victory in their final game against Samoa on Saturday, or a bonus point in defeat, to go through, with Scotland then eliminated.\n\nThe Scottish Rugby Union said it expected the game against Japan to go ahead. \u201cScottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch and will be flexible to accommodate this,\u201d the SRU said on Twitter.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThursday\u2019s decision marks the first time a World Cup match has been cancelled since the tournament started in 1987.\n\nThe 1995 semi-final between hosts South Africa and France was delayed by an hour due to a waterlogged pitch, but famously went ahead after a team of cleaning ladies took to it with brooms.\n\nThe weather is also impacting other sports in Japan, with Tokyo 2020 Olympic organisers bringing forward the test event for BMX cycling and Formula One officials monitoring the situation ahead of Sunday\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix.", "description": "Rugby World Cup organisers were forced to call off matches for the first time in the tournament's 32-year history on Thursday - eliminating Italy as a result - saying the risk from Typhoon Hagibis made hosting them an impossibility on safety grounds.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439122424&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9908R", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
