We're all Native,\" said Muriel Miguel.\n\n\"That's very exciting.\"\n\nAccording to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, the organization's Indigenous Theatre season is the first of its kind in the world.\n\nTheir first production, The Unnatural and Accidental Women, is by M\u00e9tis playwright Marie Clements. It centres on the deaths of several women in Vancouver's downtown east side.\n\nMiguel, an American director and actor, spoke with Day 6 host Brent Bambury about what audiences can expect. Here's part of their conversation.\n\nActor PJ Prudat performs in The Unnatural and Accidental Women, the first production of the National Arts Centre inaugural Indigenous Theatre season. (Justin Tang/National Arts Centre)\n\nDo you feel any pressure?\n\nYes. I feel a lot of pressure. It's kind of like the canary in the coal mine. But I'm wearing my armour and my everything and I'm going in there charging because this has to happen.\n\nThis is obviously a big moment in Canadian history and in Indigenous arts in Canada, but what's in it for you?\n\nI've been working all my life like this.\n\nI want to \u2014 it's the wrong word to say show \u2014 but how we think, how we talk to each other, how we get things together ... is not like a lot of theatre and that to me, that's what I want.\n\nThe opening play is The Unnatural and Accidental Women. It is, as you said, by the Indigenous playwright Marie Clements. Why is this a good play for Indigenous Theatre's inaugural season and for the first show?\n\nThis is about women that were murdered many years ago now, and this man [Gilbert Paul Jordan, who] was walking around. The first time that Accidental Women was really put on the stage, he was walking around because he got out on parole and nobody paid attention to it.\n\nNobody paid attention to what was happening with these women.\n\nMy group is over 40 years old and we started working on a piece called Women and Violence over 40 years ago ... and here we are and we're fighting the same thing.\n\nActors PJ Prudat, Yoland Bonnell, Jenifer Brousseau and Columpa C. Bopp perform in The Unnatural and Accidental Women. The production features an entirely Indigenous cast. (Justin Tang/National Arts Centre)\n\nSo when we hear these women talking to each other on stage, what do you want us to hear?\n\nThat these women were human beings. You know, they were on Hastings Street. No matter where they are, everyone deserves to live and everyone deserves to be happy.\n\nEveryone wants to be happy. And this is part of it; that you can't murder somebody and walk away with it.\n\nYou said that it's important to include humour in these performances. What you're talking about sounds very serious.\n\nIs there room for laughter? Is there room to show people enjoying life?\n\nHow I feel is that you keep on hitting people over the head and you hit them over the head and after a while, all they say is \"Ow\" and they just want to get away from you.\n\nSo I want to show how you can approach a lot of things with humour and still get to the point \u2014 and maybe even surprise people.\n\nYou know, they may be laughing at something and then find that you're not supposed to be laughing at that.\n\nI want other people to see this. I want them to try to understand. I want them to fight us, push back on us so we can tell them where we're standing. - Muriel Miguel, director and actor\n\nWho do you want to see the shows? Who's your ideal audience?\n\nMy ideal audience is an all-Native audience. It would be great.\n\nI mean, I've had experience with all-Native audiences and I love it. I love it because the love comes from the audience and you're surrounded with it. It's like acting on a cloud and I love that feeling.\n\nBut I do want other people to see this. I want them to try to understand. I want them to fight us, push back on us so we can tell them where we're standing.\n\nI think some people will walk out. But I think most of us are used to that. People walked out on my stuff.\n\nDoes it distract you when you see them leave?\n\nSometimes I say goodbye.\n\nDo you think you'll find in an all-Indigenous audience up there in Algonquin land, the National Arts Centre?\n\nI think so. I think Penny [Couchie, assistant director] and I have been working very hard to connect a lot of these different communities together.\n\nSo we have done that with different kinds of workshops and we went into communities and talked with people and showed pieces of what we do.\n\nWe went on those reserves and people did say, \"It's about time you came here, you know.\"\n\nMonique Mojica plays Aunt Shadie in Indigenous Theatres' production of The Unnatural and Accidental Women. (Justin Tang/National Arts Centre)\n\nWhat have you learned about Indigenous talent in Canada?\n\nThere's a lot of it ... and it's fun to work with your stories.\n\nPeople may not think that our stories are important, or that they're just a family story. Every one of those stories are important. How Aunt Lizzie met Uncle Joe. How mama ran away from home.\n\nAll those \u2026 stories that you learn under the kitchen table, that's wonderful. And if you can take that and you bring that to the theatre and talk about it in those terms, that's wonderful.\n\nMuriel Miguel, you are 82 years old. Most people your age would be deep into retirement at this point. What keeps you working on productions like this one?\n\nI never thought of retirement. I'm old; my body's getting old, but my head isn't getting old.\n\nI'm still thinking and I think about a lot of things and I think about what I want to leave behind for younger generations.\n\nAll these other generations coming up \u2014 that's what makes me continue. I want that. I want people to just be wonderful, wonderful storytellers [who] know that they can fit in with with what they carry.\n\nThat's important, and that's how I think. And I'll probably be doing this until I'm 95.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.
