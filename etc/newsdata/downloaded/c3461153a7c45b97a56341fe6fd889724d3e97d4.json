General Assembly that was denounced by China.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A propaganda banner and a security camera are placed on the walls of a mosque in the Old City in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China September 6, 2018.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nIn highlighting abuses against ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in China, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said the United Nations and its member states had \u201ca singular responsibility to speak up when survivor after survivor recounts the horrors of state repression.\u201d\n\nSullivan said it was incumbent on U.N. member states to ensure the world body was able to closely monitor human rights abuses by China and added that it must seek \u201cimmediate, unhindered, and unmonitored\u201d access to Xinjiang for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR).\n\nSullivan said Tuesday\u2019s event was co-sponsored by Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, and was joined by more than 30 U.N. states, representatives of the European Union and more than 20 nongovernmental organizations, as well as Uighur victims.\n\n\u201cWe invite others to join the international effort to demand and compel an immediate end to China\u2019s horrific campaign of repression,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory will judge the international community for how we respond to this attack on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nPaola Pampaloni, deputy managing director for Asia of the European External Action Service, said the EU was \u201calarmed\u201d by the situation and also urged \u201cmeaningful\u201d access to Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about ... information about mistreatment and torture,\u201d she said. \u201cChina is always inviting us to the camps under their conditions, we are in negotiations right now for terms and conditions for free access.\u201d\n\nOn Monday U.S. President Donald Trump called for an end to religious persecution at another event on the sidelines of the U.N. gathering. He reiterated his comments in a speech to the General Assembly gathering of world leaders on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAmericans will never .. tire in our effort to promote freedom of worship and religion. We want and support religious liberty for all,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump, who has been cautious about upsetting China on human rights issues while making a major trade deal with Beijing a major priority, said religious freedom was under growing threat around the world but fell short of specifically mentioning the Uighur situation.\n\n\u201cVolume is coming up at a pace that we hope that the Beijing government recognizes not only U.S. but the global concern about this situation,\u201d David Stilwell, U.S. Assistant Secretary, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs told reporters at a briefing.\n\n\u201cWe will see how that plays out and how Beijing reacts and take it from there.\u201d\n\nA representative for the Chinese delegation to the U.N. General Assembly accused Washington of violating the U.N. Charter by criticizing China.\n\nThe United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in what China describes as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.\n\nSullivan said the United States had received \u201ccredible reports of deaths, forced labor, torture, and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment\u201d in the camps.\n\nHe said there were also many reports that the Chinese government forces detainees to renounce their ethnic identities as well as their culture and religion.\n\nThough U.S. officials have ramped up criticism of China\u2019s measures in Xinjiang, it has refrained from responding with sanctions, amid on-again, off-again talks to resolve a bitter, costly trade war.\n\nAt the same time, it has criticized other countries, including some Muslim states, for not doing enough or for backing China\u2019s approach in Xinjiang.\n\nRishat Abbas, the brother of Uighur physician Gulshan Abbas, who was abducted from her home in Urumchi in September 2018, told Tuesday\u2019s event that \u201cmillions of Uighurs are becoming collateral damage to international trade policies, enabling China to continue to threaten our freedoms around the world, enable it to continue its police state.\u201d\n\nU.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has repeatedly pushed China to grant the United Nations access to investigate reports of disappearances and arbitrary detentions, particularly of Muslims in Xinjiang.\n\nChina\u2019s envoy in Geneva said in June that he hoped Bachelet would visit China, including Xinjiang. Bachelet\u2019s office said in June that it was discussing \u201cfull access\u201d with China.", "description": "The United States led more than 30 countries on Tuesday in condemning what it called China's \"horrific campaign of repression\" against Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang at an event on the sidelines of the annual U.N.
