The ships have internal docks that allow those troops to load into smaller vessels to be carried ashore.\n\nJUST WATCHED China releases video of 'Guam killer' missile Replay More Videos ...

It will be replaced by the newer and slightly larger USS America later this year, according to a US Navy release.\n\nJapan has two Izumo-class helicopter destroyers, which function much like amphibious assault ships.\n\nThe US ships can carry fighter jets, the short-takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B. Japan also plans to give its ships the ability to carry the F-35Bs\n\nChina, however, does not yet have an aircraft with the vertical landing capability of the F-35B.\n\nBut Schuster said it's likely that such a jet is in the works and the Type 075 has the size to accommodate it.\n\nJUST WATCHED China's military expands its influence in Africa Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China's military expands its influence in Africa 04:13\n\nIn announcing the launch of its new amphibious assault ship on Wednesday, the Chinese military noted the ship still has some work to do before it's commissioned into the active fleet.\n\n\"In the next phase, engineers will start outfitting and fine-tuning the vessel's equipment and then conduct mooring tests and sea trials,\" the Chinese military said.\n\nBut even with that, analysts noted the frenetic pace of Chinese naval shipbuilding . The ship launched just five months after pictures of its keel under construction were seen, wrote Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway on the The War Zone blog\n\n\"The speed with which the Chinese have been able to execute its construction is as impressive as the ship's size,\" they wrote.\n\nThe US Department of Defense, in its annual report for Congress on the state of China's military released in May, noted that China was the world's top shipbuilding nation.\n\nIt has been churning out advanced destroyers and submarines, and it has one domestically built aircraft carrier in sea trials and another under construction.\n\nThe US Defense Department report noted that the new Type 075 will join a fleet of eight smaller Type 071 amphibious transport docks. Those ships have limited flight deck and handle only about four helicopters, according to the report.\n\nIt also noted how China was improving and refining amphibious warfare capabilities as well as bulking up its marine corps.\n\nShuster said he expects China to eventually build three of the Type 075s with them conducting exercises and showing the Chinese flag into the Indian Ocean to Africa and possibly the Mediterranean.", "description": "China's ability to fight island and coastal conflicts got a big boost Wednesday when the country's navy launched its first amphibious assault ship.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925205930-china-amphibious-assualt-ship-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
