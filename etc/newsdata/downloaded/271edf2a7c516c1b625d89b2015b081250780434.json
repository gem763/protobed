(AP) - Dorian Thompson-Robinson passed for two touchdowns and ran for another in helping UCLA end an 11-year drought against Stanford with a 34-16 victory over the Cardinal on Thursday.\n\nJack West became Stanford\u2019s third different starting quarterback of the season, the first time that\u2019s happened since 1974. After early success, his inconsistent play led to a stalled offense.\n\nThompson-Robinson passed for 192 yards and rushed for 66 as UCLA snapped an 11-game losing streak to the Cardinal, dating to 2008. Joshua Kelley rushed for 176 yards, including a 54-yard touchdown run and a 53-yard gain.\n\nThe Bruins (2-5, 2-2 Pac-12) scored touchdowns on their first two possessions, both touchdown passes to Kyle Phillips, to open a 14-3 lead with 4:48 remaining to play. It was UCLA\u2019s first lead of more than seven points this season. Phillips caught 10 passes for 100 yards.\n\nStanford (3-4, 2-3) took the opening kickoff and drove 51 yards before Jet Toner connected on a 42-yard field goal. Toner suffered an apparent right knee injury on the ensuing kickoff and did not return. Punter Ryan Sanborn took over the kicking duties.\n\nThompson-Robinson was UCLA\u2019s leading rusher in the first quarter, helped by a 39-yard scramble that led to the Bruins second score.\n\nThe Cardinal, meanwhile, lost 8 yards combined on their next three possessions as West was sacked on three consecutive third downs.\n\nStanford\u2019s Brycen Tremayne fell on a blocked punt in the end zone to make it 14-10. Spencer Jorgensen got his left hand on the punt.\n\nThe UCLA defense sacked West seven times, five in the first quarter. The Bruins had nine total sacks over their first six games. Stanford allowed 13 in its first six.\n\nJJ Molson added field goals of 43 and 49 yards in the third quarter. UCLA outgained the Cardinal by a 455-198 margin.\n\nStanford\u2019s Cameron Scarlett rushed for 34 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown run. West was 15 of 32 for 143 yards. He passed for 38 yards on Stanford\u2019s first drive.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUCLA: Any win is good, especially one that ends a long losing streak. It\u2019s the fifth win of Chip Kelly\u2019s 18-game reign in Pasadena. The much-maligned defense (allowing an average of 431 yards) played well enough to raise the team\u2019s hopes with a handful of winnable games coming up. Thompson-Robinson was clearly the best athlete on the field.\n\nStanford: Down to its third quarterback, the Cardinal simply could not produce enough offense in an offensive-minded conference. Injuries along the offensive line have taken their toll, with junior center Drew Dalman the only lineman to make every start. Unless one of the other quarterbacks can return, Stanford may very well miss a bowl game for the first time in 11 years.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUCLA: Hosts No. 17 Arizona State on Oct. 26.\n\nStanford: Hosts Arizona on Oct. 26.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dorian Thompson-Robinson passed for two touchdowns and ran for another in helping UCLA end an 11-year drought against Stanford with a 34-16 victory over the Cardinal on Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rick Eymer"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/ucla_stanford_football_90569_c0-180-4329-2705_s1200x700.jpg?da5e6f0412f7f10b7252bc339f86a79ef4a845cc", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
