Beto O\u2019Rourke on Snapchat, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) throwing in his two cents on Twitter.\n\nButtigieg appeared in an interview Monday on Snapchat\u2019s political news show \u201cGood Luck America,\u201d where he was asked to respond to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s criticism of him as a \u201ctriangulating, poll-driven politician.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cHe needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant.\u201d\n\nThe 37-year-old mayor then distanced himself from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed mandatory assault weapon buyback, which has become a signature policy proposal for the congressman following a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, that claimed 22 lives and injured dozens more.\n\nInstead of a mandatory federal buyback \u2015 or as Buttigieg called it Monday, \u201cconfiscation\u201d \u2015 Buttigieg said he is advocating for universal background checks, red flag laws, and a ban on the sale of assault weapons. The trio of policies stands a greater chance of actually being passed into law and making a difference than O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal, he argued.\n\nSince the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, we\u2019ve been \u201ctalking and talking and talking and nothing is actually changing,\u201d said Buttigieg.\n\nO\u2019Rourke hit right back, accusing the mayor of belittling grassroots voters and overlooking the scourge of gun deaths.\n\n\u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object,\u2019\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHe can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people each year. Those people deserve action. I\u2019ll be fighting for them.\u201d\n\nAmid that tussle, Booker interjected to condemn Buttigieg\u2019s deliberate use of the word \u201cconfiscation\u201d and accused the mayor of \u201cdoing the NRA\u2019s work for them.\u201d\n\nCalling buyback programs \"confiscation\" is doing the NRA's work for them, @PeteButtigieg\u2014and they don't need our help. https://t.co/eshiBU7PIg \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) October 14, 2019\n\nIn a separate part of the interview, Buttigieg also attacked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for promising not to hold high-dollar fundraisers in the general election should she win the nomination.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve raised a lot of money from wealthy people,\u201d host Peter Hamby noted. \u201cIs she making a mistake?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy competitors can go with whatever strategy they like,\u201d Buttigieg responded, but \u201cwe need to make sure we have the resources to compete. We\u2019re not going to beat [President Trump] with pocket change.\u201d\n\nAll three candidates \u2015 Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke and Booker \u2015 have seen their polling numbers slump from springtime highs and are undoubtedly eager to try to differentiate themselves during Tuesday\u2019s debate at Otterbein University, outside of Columbus, Ohio.", "description": "Buttigieg, Beto and Booker got heated on social media Monday.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da4c8732100004207344cac.jpeg?cache=g1zick77vh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
