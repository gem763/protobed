He and his wife, who\u00b4d live on first floor, would provide the care for her.\n\nAfter her demise they would keep full possession.\n\nWorried for relative: My elderly aunt wants to sell her house at \u00a3200k discount to a friend who will let her live there and provide care for her (Stock image)\n\nThe house needs complete refurbishment as it has no heating, kitchen or bathroom that work and hasn't been decorated or modernised in over 40 years.\n\nI have power of attorney for her and it worries me that this could fall foul on many grounds. My primary concern is her long-term wellbeing and I want her to be happy.\n\nShe believes this is a good option for her. She also has her mental faculties so can make her own decisions.\n\nWhat should be the legal steps taken to protect her long-term interests and ensure that she can continue living there as long as she wants, rent free (assuming health permits) and that her financial wellbeing is not compromised?\n\nFiona Heald, partner at law firm Moore Blatch, replies: You have raised a number of very interesting matters about what is in fact quite a common situation.\n\nGiven that your aunt is mentally capable of making this decision herself, your power of attorney does not come into play.\n\nIf someone has capacity to make a specific decision at a specific time then it is up to them as to what they can do and they are entitled, as are we all, to make what other people might consider to be an unwise decision.\n\nFiona Heald: It would be best to find a lawyer who would not simply deal with the property transaction but has experience dealing with elderly clients\n\nThat does not stop you from offering kind, sensible advice to your aunt.\n\nIf she wishes to sell her house, she will have to get a solicitor to handle it for her. She needs to seek independent legal advice, meaning she must not use the same solicitor as the friend who wants to buy the property.\n\nIt would be best for her (perhaps with your help) to find a lawyer who would not simply deal with the property transaction but has experience dealing with elderly clients, and can handle all the issues in a supportive way so she is happy and secure.\n\nWhat are the pitfalls of a transaction like this for your aunt?\n\nA lawyer should go through with your aunt why she wishes to make such a gift \u2013 and it would be construed as a gift if she sold her house below market value \u2013 and what it means for her.\n\nThis would also include how the house should be valued in the first place, what rights she would \u2013 or more likely would not - have to live in the property, what would happen if the friend wanted her to move out, and many more matters.\n\nA major issue is where your aunt would live whilst all the renovation work was taking place.\n\nI am sure the friend would not want to start the work without owning the property. I am equally sure that your aunt would not wish to live in such a building site.\n\nThere is the issue of how long the work would take as well. I would also have concerns as to what would happen if, having done the work, the friend then decided that they did not wish your aunt to move in.\n\nHow do you find a specialist solicitor? The Law Society has a database of lawyers, with a search tool allowing you to look for those specialising in the particular area you want. You can input a second area of practice too - so for example, both elderly care and conveyancing - plus your postcode, to narrow your search further. Solicitors for the Elderly's members have experience and training in dealing with older clients, and it also has a search page. This is Money\n\nIt would also be good for your aunt to understand what would happen if she needed more care in future than her friend could provide.\n\nIt is very common for people to assume that they can cope and look after someone but then find that it takes too much time, or they have to do more than they thought, and to say they can no longer do it.\n\nIf that happened your aunt would have no home and \u00a3200,000 less to look after herself.\n\nThis may end up with the local council stating that they will not pay for her care as she deliberately deprived herself of assets when she knew she needed care.\n\nIt is clear that her friend receives all of the advantages in the transaction.\n\nOn top of all of the above it is possible that there may be taxation consequences for your aunt which would need to be considered as well. This would involve potentially capital gains tax and inheritance tax.\n\nI am not suggesting that your aunt cannot make this gift and have this arrangement, but like a lot of legal matters it is not simple and straight forward.\n\nWhat no one wants is for your aunt to be so focused on leaving her care home that she takes the above risks.\n\nWhat can you do to help your aunt?\n\nApart from helping her to find a lawyer, my advice would be to look at where your aunt is living now to see if that situation can be improved.\n\nI don\u2019t know who chose her care home but if she is not happy there yet does need some care, how about her moving either to a different care home or to independent but supported living so she had her own space but with help nearby.\n\nI appreciate that a move back to her own home might not be possible due to the condition that it is in, but you could suggest she sell it on the open market.\n\nThat would maximise the funds that she has, and give her the option of buying another home which didn't have the disadvantages of her old one and receiving care at home.\n\nWhen a local authority looks at someone assets to see if they should contribute towards paying for their care, any home which they own and live in is not included in the calculation.\n\nBut above all, in my opinion it is vital that she receives good legal advice from someone who understands the issues faced by an elderly client.", "description": "She believes this is a good option for her.
