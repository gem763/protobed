Now analysts are beginning to calculate that the damage for Son\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp. will likely reach into the billions of dollars.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. cut its profit estimate for SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, its main investment vehicle, by 580 billion yen ($5.4 billion) to an operating loss of 367.6 billion yen for the September quarter, citing declines in the stock prices of Uber and Slack Technologies Inc. and the withdrawn WeWork IPO. It also reduced SoftBank Group\u2019s fiscal year operating profit by the same amount to 1.01 trillion yen.\n\nSon is going through a particularly rocky stretch after repositioning SoftBank from a telecom operator into an investment conglomerate, with stakes in scores of startups around the world. He built a personal fortune of about $14 billion with strategic bets on companies such as China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. But the recent troubles have weighed on SoftBank\u2019s shares, pushing them down about 30% from their peak earlier this year as investors grow skittish about startup valuations.\n\n\u201cProfits in the [SoftBank Vision Fund] segment may still see considerable volatility ahead,\u201d Mitsubishi UFJ analyst Hideaki Tanaka wrote.\n\nIn an interview with the Nikkei Business magazine, Son said he is unhappy with how far short his accomplishments to date have fallen of his goals.\n\n\u201cThe results still have a long way to go and that makes me embarrassed and impatient,\u201d Son said. \u201cI used to envy the scale of the markets in the U.S. and China, but now you see red-hot growth companies coming out of small markets like in Southeast Asia. There is just no excuse for entrepreneurs in Japan, myself included.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt only just began and I feel there is tremendous potential there,\u201d Son told Nikkei Business. The strategy is to invest in companies that share his vision of a world being reshaped by artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nSoftBank Gives \u2018Very Public Lesson\u2019 to Founders in WeWork Ouster\n\nWeWork and Uber may be losing money now, but they will be substantially profitable in 10 years\u2019 time, Son said in the interview. At a private retreat for portfolio companies late last month he had a different message: become profitable soon. At the gathering, held at the five-star Langham resort in Pasadena, California, Son also stressed the importance of good governance. Just days later, SoftBank led the ouster of WeWork\u2019s controversial co-founder Adam Neumann.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son\u2019s startups have had a rough few months, from a botched initial public offering by WeWork to a sharp decline in shares of Uber Technologies Inc.
