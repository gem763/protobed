It also took out 2 billion cubic feet of daily gas production. Oil prices have soared worldwide amid the damage in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAramco, the Saudi oil company targeted, said no workers were injured in the attack.\n\nThe attack early Saturday on the kingdom\u2019s facilities in the east was claimed as multiple drone strikes by Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nSaudi Arabia, however, says the attack did not come from Yemen and said initial investigations show Iranian weapons were used. The kingdom, though, has not yet said where the attack was launched from or what kind of weapons were involved.\n\nThe U.S has made similar allegations, going so far as to say the attack may have been launched from Iran itself or nearby Iraq, where Iran has powerful proxy militias on the ground.\n\nIran has denied the charges.\n\nSaudi Arabia on Tuesday called on the international community \u201cto shoulder its responsibility in condemning the perpetrators\u201d and \u201cclearly confronting\u201d those behind the attack. The government\u2019s statements were carried in state-run media following a weekly Cabinet meeting that was overseen by King Salman, who was quoted saying Saudi Arabia is capable of defending against such \u201ccowardly attacks.\u201d\n\nCurrent tensions stem from President Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. He also re-imposed and escalated sanctions on Iran that sent the country\u2019s economy into freefall, including targeting its oil exports.\n\nKhamenei said the U.S. wants to prove its \u201cmaximum pressure policy\u201d against Iran is successful. \u201cIn return, we have to prove that the policy is not worth a penny for the Iranian nation,\u201d Khamenei said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why all Iranian officials, from the president and the foreign minister to all others, have announced that we do not negotiate (with the U.S.) either bilaterally or multilaterally,\u201d he said.\n\nThere had been reports about a possible meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, during the upcoming U.N. General Assembly next week in New York.\n\nTrump declared Monday it \u201clooks\u201d like Iran was behind the explosive attack on the Saudi oil facilities. But he stressed that military retaliation was not yet on the table in response to the strike against a key U.S. Mideast ally.\n\nTrump, alternating between aggressive and nonviolent reactions, said the U.S. could respond \u201cwith an attack many, many times larger\u201d but also \u201cI\u2019m not looking at options right now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, he had said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded.\u201d He also said the impact of oil production shortages would not be significant on the U.S., which is a net energy exporter.\n\nThe American Automobile Association, known as AAA, said Tuesday that Americans can expect local pump prices to start to increase this week by as much 25 cents per gallon throughout September.\n\n\u201cWhether this is a short or long term trend will be determined by the price of crude oil prices and how quickly the facilities in Saudi Arabia can recover and get back online,\u201d said Jeanette Casselano, AAA spokesperson.\n\nOne U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the U.S. was considering dispatching additional military resources to the Gulf but that no decisions had been made. The U.S. already has the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group in the area, as well as fighter jets, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and air defenses.\n\nAmerican officials released satellite images of the damage at the heart of the kingdom\u2019s Abqaiq processing plant and a key oil field, and two U.S. officials said the attackers used multiple cruise missiles and drone aircraft.\n\nPrivate experts said the satellite images show the attackers had detailed knowledge of which tanks and machinery to hit within the sprawling Saudi oil processing facility at Abqaiq to cripple production. But \u201csatellite imagery can\u2019t show you where the attack originated from,\u201d said Joe Bermudez, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who examined the images.\n\nThe Saudis invited the U.N. and other international experts to help investigate, suggesting there was no rush to retaliate and that the kingdom is looking for an internationally backed response to the attack.\n\nFor his part, Khamenei on Tuesday reiterated Iran\u2019s stance that if the U.S. returns to the nuclear deal, Tehran would consider negotiations.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, no talks will happen \u2026 with the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither in New York nor anywhere\u201d else.\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
