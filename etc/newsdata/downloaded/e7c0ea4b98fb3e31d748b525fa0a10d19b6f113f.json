They need an audience. \u2026 They need to be heard and you need to listen to them.\u2019 So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Sept. 24 webinar sponsored by Borrow Smart Compliance, an industry consultant, gives surprisingly frank insight into the payday lending industry\u2019s strategy to push for weaker government regulations by forging a tight relationship with the Trump administration and the president\u2019s campaign. The payday lending industry, made up of businesses that make short-term loans to consumers at high interest rates, is awaiting new rules that could weaken Obama administration requirements. Those rules include a requirement that the companies must ensure consumers can afford to repay the money they borrow.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the powerful chair of the Financial Services Committee, is an industry \u201chater,\u201d and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would pose a big threat if elected president, Hodges and three other industry insiders said during the talk. They called Trump their \u201cultimate backstop\u201d against attempts to defeat legislation the industry wants.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump was elected, the needle moved in our favor \u2014 finally,\u201d Max Wood of Borrow Smart Compliance said during the webinar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you need something and we may need something \u2026 then it would be good to be able to pick up the phone and call someone that could get the president\u2019s attention,\u201d Wood said during the webinar. Contributing to Trump\u2019s campaign will help keep the president in office, he said, and \u201cit will give [Hodges] access in the event that we need to have access to the president.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Wood acknowledged posting the YouTube video but then referred questions about fundraising to others who took part. The video, which had about 40 views as of Friday afternoon, was removed shortly after The Post asked Wood about it.\n\nThe major focus of the call appeared to be fundraising, which the industry insiders said would be critical to maintaining access to the Trump administration. Hodges encouraged others to donate to Trump\u2019s campaign and referred to his efforts to bolster his standing with the administration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf I can show the campaign that Tina and I have brought in net new givers to the campaign, meaning whether it\u2019s $100, $50, $25, $15,000 or $50,000 if they didn\u2019t give last time, that is a boost to us as fundraisers,\u201d Hodges said, referring to his wife.\n\nHodges said on the webinar that he has made more than $1 million in campaign contributions to help Trump since 2016. In an interview, Hodges said he is an \u201centhusiastic\u201d supporter of the president but had never used his status to ask the administration for help.\n\n\u201cWhen I am talking about access, I am not talking about the administration. I haven\u2019t lobbied the administration,\u201d he said in an interview. He said his support of the president is not connected to pushing any specific industry agenda. \u201cI have not gone over to the White House because of Ronna McDaniel. \u2026 That just has not happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut during the webinar, Hodges said it would give him a \u201cboost\u201d if he could show that he had brought in donors who had never given before, even if their contributions were small.\n\n\u201cThat is important to the campaign, which means it\u2019s important to the president, which means it\u2019s important if you ever had to call on anyone for anything in the administration,\u201d he said during the call. \u201cThat\u2019s how those things work.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment for this story. Trump\u2019s reelection committee did not return a call for comment.\n\nIn a statement, Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said, \u201cPart of the RNC\u2019s job is sharing what we hear from supporters across the country with party leaders. We often will connect our supporters with other Republican officials when they have a message they would like to pass along. Democrat policies would destroy millions of jobs, and that is not something our supporters and our organization will ever be shy about communicating.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElisha Brown of Speedee Cash, a payday lender based in Florida, and Ed D\u2019Alessio, executive director of the Financial Service Centers of America, who also participated in the webinar, did not return repeated calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many other people participated in the webinar.\n\nThe YouTube video was discovered by two advocacy groups, Allied Progress and Americans for Financial Reform.\n\n\u201cWe have here a striking example of how money in American politics leads to the abuse of consumers in the financial services marketplace,\u201d said Linda Jun, senior policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform.\n\nDerek Martin, director of Allied Progress, said: \u201cThis presentation reflects the worst of Washington, D.C. \u2014 wealthy executives buying off politicians so they can keep their predatory business model intact.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsumer advocates and the Obama administration have argued that new rules on the industry were necessary to end the \u201cdebt trap\u201d in which, once taking out one payday loan, consumers are forced to take out another and another to keep up.\n\nBut payday lenders have said the rules were too complicated and would drive many of them out of business. The industry launched an aggressive counterattack, suing to block the rules, recruiting black pastors to speak out in their defense and commissioning academic research that bolstered their talking points. The Community Financial Services Association of America held its annual meeting at the Trump National Doral Miami golf club for the past two years.\n\nThe industry\u2019s outlook began to change under the Trump administration. In late 2017, the president appointed Mick Mulvaney, now acting White House chief of staff, to temporarily run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As a South Carolina congressman, Mulvaney had called the bureau a \u201cjoke\u201d and co-sponsored legislation to close its doors. While CFPB\u2019s acting director, Mulvaney took several steps that helped dial back pressure on payday lenders, including calling for a review of wide-ranging rules finalized by the previous administration and dropping several lawsuits against payday lenders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow the CFPB, run by Kathy Kraninger, is considering whether to rescind the Obama administration\u2019s rule requiring that payday lenders verify consumers can afford their loans, a potential major victory for the industry. Kraninger previously worked for Mulvaney at the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBut the industry has grown concerned that House Democrats, led by Waters, could block efforts to roll back those regulations using the Congressional Review Act, known as the CRA. That law allows legislators to block new regulations before they go into effect and was used repeatedly by Republicans in the past few years to roll back Obama-era rules.\n\n\u201cI think if we were to say that she\u2019s a hater of the industry, that would be an understatement,\u201d D\u2019Alessio, of the Financial Service Centers of America, said of Waters during the webinar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe industry would be unlikely to be able to stop efforts in the Democrat-controlled House to scuttle the weaker rules that payday lenders hope the CFPB will adopt, D\u2019Alessio said during the webinar. Finding enough Republicans to block such an attempt in the Senate, where some lawmakers are facing tough reelection campaigns, could also be difficult, he said.\n\n\u201cThat puts us in a position where the ultimate backstop is the White House. And there we will be relying upon President Trump,\u201d D\u2019Alessio said.\n\nDuring the webinar and in an interview, Hodges pitched himself as a family business owner who could help spread the industry\u2019s message. Tennessee-based Advance Financial started with just a few storefronts but now has more than 100 in the state.\n\nThe company has grown significantly since Trump was elected, doubling its workforce to 1,300, increasing contributions to employees\u2019 retirement accounts and distributing bonuses after the 2017 tax cut, Hodges said.\n\n\u201cAny chance I have to talk about the about the jobs he has helped me create I\u201d do, Hodges said in an interview. \u201cThere has been this economic resurgence.\u201d\n\nHe has emerged as a top Trump fundraiser. During the 2016 election cycle, the company\u2019s owners and employees spent $270,385 on campaigns, compared with $1,000 during the 2014 campaign cycle, according to Open Secrets. That jumped to $965,450 in 2018 and $672,956 so far for the 2020 cycle. Almost all of that money went to Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say this number because if you told me this five years ago, I would have thought you were crazy. But we\u2019ve donated about $1.25 million to his campaign so far,\u201d Hodges said.\n\n\u201cSo Tina and I have become, I would say, one of the larger donors to the campaign over the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, Hodges said, he has raised another $200,000. During the call, he encouraged other industry officials to contribute to or attend an Oct. 7 fundraiser featuring Vice President Pence in Tennessee. The tickets ranged from $1,000 to $100,000, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by the Nashville Post.\n\nDuring the webinar, Hodges explained why such fundraisers were important. When money comes in that way \u201cthat raises the clout of that fundraiser so that when you go and speak to the administration through the campaign, they will listen.\u201d\n\nHodges said in an interview that he is aiming to raise \u201cas much money as possible\u201d for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, potentially $1 million.\n\n\u201cThe last administration and candidate [Hillary] Clinton \u2026 was working hard to end an industry that provides a lot of jobs for folks,\u201d Hodges said in an interview. \u201cTrump was running on pro-growth, pro-business [campaign] \u2026 as an entrepreneur it was an easy choice.\u201d\n\nAfter the webinar, Michael Brown, a payday industry consultant, touted the group\u2019s message on his website. \u201cIf Warren wins you can bet on day 1 of her Presidency she will be focused on her baby, the CFPB. That is a doomsday scenario for the payday industry,\u201d he said, echoing a talking point from the webinar. Warren conceived of the CFPB in the wake of the global financial crisis and has touted its success repeatedly during her presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is important for our industry to support the Trump Campaign financially and with votes.\u201d", "description": "The recording offers a surprisingly frank insight into the payday lending industry\u2019s strategy for advocating for weaker government regulations by forging a tight relationship with the Trump administration and the president\u2019s campaign.", "authors": ["Renae Merle", "Reporter Covering White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yVJuqr9cnlGG1zbxJyr0fIUzFYM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KAQBBYHZ2II6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
