Subscribe\n\nWhat makes WeWork\u2019s business bad is what makes it great\n\nNews only seems to be getting worse for The We Company, parent of WeWork, and its investors. In just the past week, news broke that the company was delaying its IPO and that top investors were looking to push out its co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann. Some might wonder: why does WeWork exist at all? The short answer: businesses love it!\n\nFor a little bit of money, The We Company will set you up with a cool desk, a cool office, or even a cool headquarters with \u201ccustom art and furniture designed for creativity, comfort, and productivity,\u201d and all of the necessary comforts of the working creature like \u201cfresh fruit water, micro-roasted coffee, and tea.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great for the small business that doesn\u2019t have the time or money to build that office from scratch, and it\u2019s great for the large business that needs a little bit of extra space for a short burst of time.\n\nOver time, it probably makes economic sense to set up your own office. But for a small premium, WeWork will give your business a whole lot of flexibility right now.\n\nTo put it another way, WeWork will assume a lot of risk for you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes the short-term, shared-office space business so risky.\n\n\u201cWe is highly susceptible to a recession, as the company signs long-term leases with office landlords and then sub-leases to tenants on a shorter-term contract,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Barry Oxford explained after news broke that WeWork would delay its IPO. \u201cBy leasing space on a short-term basis, the company is able to charge a premium, which has fueled growth, but in a potential slowdown, the mismatched duration may put the company at risk.\u201d\n\nYou see, when you buy an office or sign a long-term lease, you are on the hook. With WeWork, you can walk away. So when times get tough, your small business can move its HQ to your dining room and your large business can just cut this variable expense. It\u2019s not unlike how a business will let go of its freelancers before its full-timers, which is meta because WeWork\u2019s risk section notes: \u201cA significant portion of our member base consists of small- and mid-sized businesses and freelancers who may be disproportionately affected by adverse economic conditions.\u201d\n\nBut WeWork, of course, isn\u2019t totally exposed. The company uses something called \u201cspecial purpose entities\u201d to hedge itself should things go south. From We\u2019s S-1 filing: \u201cA majority of our leases are held by individual special purpose entities.\u201d\n\nWeWork and the James Beard Foundation discussion about sustainability and food choices on June 24, 2019 in Seattle, Washington. (Mat Hayward/Getty Images for WeWork) More\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren flagged this in a speech he gave on Friday (h/t Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Cheung): \u201cThis structure may allow the co-working company to potentially walk away from unprofitable lease arrangements in an economic downturn without the property owner having recourse to the ultimate parent, the co-working company. Simply put, I am concerned that commercial real estate losses will be larger in the next downturn because of this growing feature of the real estate market, which could ultimately make runs and vacancies more likely due to this new leasing model.\u201d\n\nWhoa! Everybody hold your horses. We\u2019ve gone from talking about a risky business model, to mapping out what happens in a recession, to explaining why WeWork-like businesses can exacerbate a commercial real estate crisis. That\u2019s a lot of scary stuff.\n\nSpecifically, it\u2019s a lot of scary stuff a business has to think about as it models out its long-term strategy. Importantly, a business will want flexibility should things turn south. Fortunately, there are service companies whose whole business model is about supplying flexibility and insulation from risk.
