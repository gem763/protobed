Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLos Angeles Chargers holdout running back Melvin Gordon said Tuesday night in an Instagram video that he is \u201cgoing to play somewhere\u201d this year.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Gordon added that \u201cit would be a waste of talent\u201d if he were to sit out the entire season. He also took a shot at the team\u2019s fan base, saying that the Chargers\u2019 12-4 record last year \u201cwas good, but nobody (in Los Angeles) cared.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers are off to a 1-1 start without Gordon, with Austin Ekeler (29 carries, 124 yards, two touchdowns) and Justin Jackson (13 carries, 116 yards) handling the bulk of the ground attack.\n\nNow on the fifth-year team option of his rookie contract, Gordon was set to make $5.6 million in 2019. A two-time Pro Bowl selection, he reportedly rejected a deal that would pay him roughly $10 million this season.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported late in the preseason that Gordon and his representatives received permission from the Chargers to find a team willing to acquire him in a trade.\n\nIn the days before the season started, ProFootballTalk.com reported that the Chargers were seeking first- and fifth-round draft picks in a potential trade for Gordon.\n\nA first-round pick out of Wisconsin in 2015, Gordon has rushed for 3,628 yards on 897 carries (4.0-yard average) with 28 touchdowns in four seasons. He also has 182 catches for 1,577 yards and 10 TDs.\n\nGordon\u2019s best year was 2017, when he played all 16 games and rushed for a career-best 1,105 yards and eight touchdowns. He also caught 58 passes for 476 yards and four TDs.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Los Angeles Chargers holdout running back Melvin Gordon said Tuesday night in an Instagram video that he is \"going to play somewhere\" this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431124730&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0EZ-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
