The company said on Sunday any guests who had paid the hotel had been refunded.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that a small number of customers were asked to pay for their hotel room before leaving Les Orangers in Tunisia [on Saturday]. This has now been resolved and customers flew home as planned. We continue to support our customers in all our resorts,\u201d said a Thomas Cook spokesperson.\n\nLynn and Peter Taylor from Newcastle, who had travelled to Tunisia with Thomas Cook, said guests leaving the hotel had been asked for extra payment.\n\n\u201cThose who were due to leave today had letters slipped under their door,\u201d said Lynn Taylor. \u201cThe hotel was asking for 6,000 TD.
