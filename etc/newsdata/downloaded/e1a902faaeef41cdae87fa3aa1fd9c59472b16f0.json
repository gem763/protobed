The online retailer gained investor confidence out of the gate, more than doubling its $14.95 opening share price after the IPO.\n\nThat lasted until May, when Jumia\u2019s stock came under attack from short-seller Andrew Left, whose firm Citron Research, issued a report accusing the company of fraud. That prompted several securities related lawsuits against Jumia.\n\nAt quick glance, Citron\u2019s primary claim \u2014 that Jumia\u2019s SEC filing contained discrepancies in sales figures \u2014 shares some resemblance to Jumia\u2019s own disclosures.\n\nThe company\u2019s share-price has suffered due to both \u2014 falling to less than 50% of its opening in April.\n\nThis has all funneled into an ongoing debate across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem on Jumia\u2019s legitimacy as an African startup, given its (primarily) European senior management. Some of the most critical voices have gone so far as to support Left\u2019s claims on Jumia\u2019s fraud \u2014 and accept Jumia\u2019s August admission as validation.\n\nSound messy and confusing? We\u2019ll, yes, it is. But so go some IPOs.\n\nJumia\u2019s info vs. Citron\u2019s claims\n\nEvaluating Jumia\u2019s J-Force scandal vs. Citron\u2019s short-sell claims is really Chartered Financial Analyst stuff. Citibank Research issued a brief rebutting Left\u2019s claims in May and then another in August \u2014 though the firm has not made either public.\n\nJudging by Jumia\u2019s share-price fluctuation and chatter that continues in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, there\u2019s still confusion around both matters.\n\nA simple exercise is to lay out the core of what Jumia has released vs. the crux of Citron Research\u2019s claims.\n\nOn the J-Force/improper sales matter, here are excerpts of Jumia\u2019s statement. Note that GMV is Gross Merchandise Value \u2014 the total amount of goods sold over the period:\n\nAs disclosed in our prospectus dated April 11, 2019, we received information alleging that some of our independent sales consultants, members of our JForce program in Nigeria, may have engaged in improper sales practices. In response, we launched a review of sales practices covering all our countries of operation and data from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019.\n\nJumia did disclose this in its IPO prospectus on page 34.\n\nIn the course of this review, we identified several JForce agents and sellers who collaborated with employees in order to benefit from differences between commissions charged to sellers and higher commissions paid to JForce agents. The transactions in question generated approximately 1% of our GMV in each of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 and had virtually no impact on our 2018 or 2019 financial statements. We have terminated the employees and JForce agents involved, removed the sellers implicated and implemented measures designed to prevent similar instances in the future. The review of this matter is closed.\n\nAnd finally, Jumia noted this:\n\nMore recently, we have also identified instances where improper orders were placed, including through the JForce program, and subsequently cancelled. Based on our findings to date, we believe that the transactions in question generated approximately 2% of our GMV in 2018, concentrated in the fourth quarter of 2018, approximately 4% in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately 0.1% in the second quarter of 2019. These 0.1% have already been adjusted for in the reported GMV figure for the second quarter of 2019. These transactions had no impact on our financial statements. We have suspended the employees involved pending the outcome of our review and are implementing measures designed to prevent similar instances in the future. We continue our review of this matter.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of Jumia\u2019s disclosure: a small number of employees cooked some sales numbers and commissions, it was negligible to our financials, we flagged the investigation in our IPO prospectus, we took action, we ended it.\n\nThe Citron Research report Andrew Left issued to support his short-sell position made several critical claims regarding Jumia, but labeled \u201cthe smoking gun\u201d as alleged material inconsistencies between an October 2018, Jumia investor presentation and Jumia\u2019s April SEC Form F-1.\n\nFor the year 2017, there\u2019s a difference of 600,000 active customers and 10,000 merchants in Jumia\u2019s reporting between the fall 2018 investor presentation and the recent 2019 F-1, according to Citron Research. Citron also goes on to press concerns with GMV:\n\nIn order to raise more money from investors, Jumia inflated its active consumers and active merchants figures by 20-30% (FRAUD). The most disturbing disclosure that Jumia removed from its F-1 filing was that 41% of orders were returned, not delivered, or cancelled. This was previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s October 2018 confidential investor presentation. This number is so alarming that is screams fraudulent activities. Instead, Jumia disclosed that \u201corders accounting for 14.4% of our GMV were either failed deliveries or returned by our consumers\u201d in 2018.\n\nTechCrunch connected with Jumia\u2019s CEO Sacha Poignonnec and Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left since the August earnings reporting and disclosures.\n\nOn whether Jumia\u2019s revelation of improper sales practices validated the fraud claims in Citron\u2019s Brief, \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Poignnonec,\u201d told me on a call last month.\n\n\u201cFor every one of those allegations,\u201d he said referring to Left\u2019s research, \u201cthere is a clear and simple answer for each of them and we have provided those,\u201d said Poignnonec.\n\nWhere is Andrew Left on the matter? \u201cI\u2019m no longer short the stock\u201d he told TechCrunch in a mail this week.\n\n\u201cBut that does not mean the stock is a buy whatsoever,\u201d he added \u2014 sticking to the fundamentals of his May brief.\n\nWhat to make of it all?\n\nIt appears that what Jumia disclosed in its April prospectus (and added more detail to in August) does not provide one-to-one validation of the claims in Citron Research\u2019s May report.\n\nBut then again, the entire matter \u2014 the data, the similar terminology, the multiple docs and disclosures \u2014 is still all a bit confusing.\n\nThat was evident in an exchange between Sacha Poignonnec and CNBC contributor John Fortt after Jumia\u2019s 2nd quarter earnings call (see 1:19). Fort pressed Poignonnec on Left\u2019s claims vs. Jumia\u2019s admissions and still came away a bit puzzled.\n\nThe market, too, appears to be impacted by the fuzziness around Jumia\u2019s disclosure of improper sales practices and Andrew Left\u2019s claims.\n\nJumia\u2019s share price plummeted 43% the week Left released his short-sell claims, from $49 to $26.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has continued to decline since Jumia\u2019s August earnings call (and sales-fraud disclosure) to $6.52 at close Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s 50% below the company\u2019s opening in April and 80% below its high before Citron\u2019s Research brief and Andrew Left\u2019s short-sell position.\n\nJumia\u2019s core investors appeared to show continued confidence in the company this month, when there wasn\u2019t a big selloff after the IPO lockup period expired.\n\nEven so, Jumia\u2019s 3rd quarter earning\u2019s call on November 12 could be a bit make or break for the company with investors given all the volatility the e-commerce venture has faced since listing and its rapid loss in value.\n\nAs a public company now, the most direct way for Jumia to revive its share-price (and investor confidence) would be demonstrating it has reduced losses while maintaining or boosting revenues.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s the prescription for just about any recently IPO\u2019d tech venture.\n\nWhat Jumia may want to evaluate pre-earnings call is the extent to which its own sales-fraud disclosure and Andrew Left\u2019s allegations are still being mashed together and impacting brand-equity in Africa and investor confidence abroad.\n\nFrom there it could be wise to address both head on and explain \u2014 in a way that is as easy as possible for people to understand \u2014 how the two are not the same and don\u2019t have a bearing on Jumia\u2019s brand or business model.", "description": "In advance of Jumia\u2019s November financial reporting, it\u2019s worth revisiting the company\u2019s second quarter results, the downside of which included some negative news beyond losses.
