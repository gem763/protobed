That\u2019s why diseases like cholera, dysentery and tuberculosis have long thrived in refugee camps and prisons and among soldiers during wartime.\n\nSo federal officials should not be surprised that migrant detention centers along the nation\u2019s southern border have become hotbeds of communicable diseases \u2014 with multiple outbreaks of scabies, shingles, lice, mumps, chickenpox and flu logged this year and last. As the Office of Inspector General noted in a July report, these facilities are dangerously overcrowded. Detainees there have not been provided with adequate nutrition, sanitation or health care. And many of them are being held for weeks or months in quarters designed for a 72-hour stay.\n\nThe report describes horrendous conditions: 88 people crammed into a room meant for 41, detainees forced to go months without a shower or a change of clothes, young children covered in filth for weeks on end. At least six children have died from communicable diseases in these facilities in the past two years.\n\nAt least three of those deaths were related , in part, to flu. Which makes all the more confounding reports from CNBC and other outlets last week that immigration officials have no plans to vaccinate detainees before the coming flu season.", "description": "The failure to provide flu vaccines to detained migrants is a recipe for disaster.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/25/opinion/25flu/25flu-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
