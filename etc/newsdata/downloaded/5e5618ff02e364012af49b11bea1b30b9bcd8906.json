REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) said on Thursday its chief executive for U.S. operations, Greg Foran, will leave the company early next year and be replaced by the head of its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse chain unit, John Furner.\n\nForan\u2019s departure is likely to be considered a blow for Walmart given the New Zealand native is credited with turning around Walmart\u2019s U.S. business by focusing on improving existing stores. Walmart reported 20 quarters of comparable sales growth under his leadership.\n\nForan, who has held the job since 2014, will stay with Walmart until Jan. 31 and then take on the role of chief executive at Air New Zealand Ltd (AIR.NZ), an appointment that was also announced separately by the airline.\n\nWalmart Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Foran\u2019s ability to innovate, including using new technology, \u201chas helped position us for the future.\u201d\n\nHowever, some investors were skeptical of the change in leadership.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been highly impressed with Mr. Furner\u2019s work at Sam\u2019s Club... he does admittedly have big shoes to fill,\u201d said a note from Jefferies Group LLC (JEF.N). \u201cWe can\u2019t help but expect the market to react negatively to today\u2019s news.\u201d\n\nFurner has run the $57.8 billion Sam\u2019s Club business since 2017. Over that time, he has improved the unit\u2019s performance with higher comparable sales by pushing the retailer to innovate, shutting stores, and repurposing stores as distribution hubs.\n\nWalmart in August raised its forecasts for U.S. comparable sales for the full year. Its shares have risen 28% so far this year.", "description": "Walmart Inc said on Thursday its chief executive for U.S. operations, Greg Foran, will leave the company early next year and be replaced by the head of its Sam's Club warehouse chain unit, John Furner.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439509925&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992FM", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
