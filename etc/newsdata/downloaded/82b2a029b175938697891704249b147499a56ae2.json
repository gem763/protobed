I was in tears at times, ready to throw in the towel, but luckily, I was too darn stubborn.\n\n\u2018What really helped me was that this time I was okay to go slowly, and just take my time.\n\n\u2018This fitness journey will undoubtedly improve my quality of life as I move deeper into old age. I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u2019\n\nShe lost four stone in seven months (Picture: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\nJoan\u2019s diet prior to the fitness journey included two slices of toast with jam and coffee for breakfast, a sandwich and fruit salad for lunch, meat and vegetables and dessert for dinner.\n\nShe would also snack on sweets, chocolates or nuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow she sticks to a healthier meal plan; egg whites, cheese, meat, vegetables and bread or half a bagel for breakfast, coconut milk, protein powder, fruit and ice blended for a smoothie for lunch and for dinner she now has meat, vegetables, and a salad.\n\nShe now says that her new look has prompted attention from younger men who give her compliments that have boosted her self-confidence. Her husband has also noticed a change in her.\n\n\u2018It has changed the way I feel about myself; people at my gym would approach me and compliment me on the changes they saw in me,\u2019 she added.\n\nShe is also determined to keep the weight off and has words of advice for those looking to transform themselves too.\n\n\u2018For those who truly feel at a loss, I\u2019d say change one thing with your food intake and one exercise to do and each week add something new.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t expect miracles right away, take it slow and steady but keep building.\n\n\u2018For those who prefer a challenge, go to a gym and if possible get yourself a legitimate trainer, someone who can help with food as well and you will achieve results faster.\u2019\n\nMORE: Super ripped 63-year-old grandma says her muscles help her land younger men\n\nMORE: Grandma, 61, wants to show people there\u2019s no age limit to bodybuilding\n\nMORE: This 97-year-old grandma who weightlifts is the fitness inspo we all need\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Retired Joan MacDonald, from Ontario, Canada, used to rely on food to escape difficulties in her marriage.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90824923_1571567489.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
