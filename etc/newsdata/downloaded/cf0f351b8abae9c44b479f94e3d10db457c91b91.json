Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani also alleges some officials in Ukraine conspired to help Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton.\n\nZelenskiy said he was open to a joint investigation into Burisma and the 2016 U.S. election but stressed Ukraine was an independent country with independent law enforcement agencies whose work he had no right to influence.\n\n\u201cWe are ready and I have already said this, if there would be a joint investigation and a joint commission of general prosecutors regarding the Burisma case, we are ready,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd we are ready to investigate interference in the election from the Ukrainian side, if it took place. Because there is really much information on this out there. But it has to be confirmed.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s new top prosecutor said last week he would review 15 previous investigations related to the founder of Burisma but also said he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.\n\nNO BLACKMAIL\n\nTrump froze nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Zelenskiy, prompting accusations from Democrats that he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and defended the call as \u201cperfect,\u201d and many of his fellow Republicans have blasted the impeachment investigation as blatant partisan politics.\n\nZelenskiy said he had not known that U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been blocked at the time of the July call. Having been made aware of this by his defense minister later, he raised the issue during a separate meeting in September in Poland with Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy holds a press-marathon at a food market in Kiev, Ukraine October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich\n\nZelenskiy told reporters that his aim in having a phone call with Trump was to arrange a subsequent meeting and that he had asked the White House to change its rhetoric on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere was no blackmail. This was not the subject of our conversation,\u201d Zelenskiy said about his call with Trump, speaking to reporters in a day-long series of televised briefings with the press, held at a Kiev food court.\n\nZelenskiy said there were no conditions attached to him meeting Trump, including whether he should investigate the activities of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter at Burisma.\n\nThe White House published its summary of the call between Zelenskiy and Trump in September. Asked whether the Ukrainian version matched up to the U.S. one, Zelenskiy said: \u201cI didn\u2019t even check, but I think that it matches completely.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy said he was not willing to publish Ukraine\u2019s record of the conversation.\n\nBiden for the first time on Wednesday made a direct call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Trump meanwhile continued to paint the probe as a partisan smear and accused the U.S. intelligence officer who filed the whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment row of having political motives.\n\nZelenskiy said he had no desire to interfere in the U.S. election.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nZelenskiy said he had been made aware by his defense minister that Washington had frozen military aid to Ukraine.\n\nHe raised the issue at a meeting with Pence in Warsaw when they met at a commemoration to mark the 80th anniversary of the start of the Second World War.\n\n\u201cI told him ... please help to resolve it,\u201d Zelenskiy recalled asking Pence. \u201cAnd after our meeting America unblocked the aid.\u201d", "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he would be ready to open a probe into any Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into the company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son was a board member.", "authors": ["Natalia Zinets", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439316953&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990L5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
