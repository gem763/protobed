Once the code finds its way onto computers, it is able to collect information antivirus software, OS version information and more.\n\nThe company claims,\n\n\u201c[Casbaneiro] can take screenshots and send them to its server, simulate mouse and keyboard actions and capture keystrokes, download and install updates to itself, restrict access to various websites, and download and execute other executables.\u201d\n\nAnd the company states that the Casbaneiro \u201cmalware family is closely connected to\u201d Amavaldo, another trojan that mainly targets Latin American online banking and cryptocurrency customers.\n\nMeanwhile, another cybersecurity company named Prevailion states that it has detected an \u201congoing cyber-crime campaign\u201d named MasterMana Botnet that is targetting cryptocurrency wallets. The company says the campaign, was first detected in December last year and was still active as late as 24 September 2019.\n\nMost alarmingly, Prevailion claims that the cost to \u201cdeploy and maintain the campaign was virtually nonexistent,\u201d as it made use of a Virtual Private Server (available for as little as USD 60), and Trojan software Azorult, which it says is available \u201con Russian forums at prices ranging up to USD 100.\u201d\n\nPrevious versions made use of Revenge Rat software. That trojan is available online for free on certain websites, bringing the campaign operation price down to just USD 60.\n\nThe company described the malware as \u201colder, but still highly effective.\u201d\n\nThe MasterMana Botnet campaign involves hackers sending enormous quantities of phishing emails to unsuspecting users, featuring attachments riddled with malicious code.\n\nThe malware provides hackers with backdoor access to email accounts, messenger applications such as Telegram, web cookies, browser history and \u2013 most worryingly, perhaps \u2013 cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe security company said the code also provided \u201cfunctionality that could allow an actor to deploy additional payloads, such as cryptominers and ransomware.\u201d", "description": "Security experts are warning cryptocurrency holders to be aware of cyber thieves who are using a wide range of often low-cost software to \u201charvest\u201d Bitcoin and altcoins from wallets all over the world.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/6ffc5c4e8c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
