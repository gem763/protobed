Fati, who became Bar\u00e7a\u2019s youngest goalscorer two weeks ago by netting at Osasuna, struck his first goal at Camp Nou to give the hosts the lead with less than two minutes on the clock by smashing a pass from Frenkie de Jong into the net.\n\nThe teenager then returned the favour by dashing in to the area from the left wing and teeing up De Jong to score his first goal for the club in the seventh minute. Valencia, playing their first game since sacking their coach Marcelino and replacing him with Albert Celades, pulled a goal back later in the half through Kevin Gameiro but Bar\u00e7a came flying back at them after the interval.\n\nReal Madrid relieved to hold on for nervy win after Levante fightback Read more\n\nGerard Piqu\u00e9 bundled the ball into the net in the 51st minute after Antoine Griezmann had hit the post before Luis Su\u00e1rez netted twice after coming off the bench. Maxi G\u00f3mez got a consolation goal for Valencia in stoppage time. The victory takes Barcelona, who are still missing their captain, Lionel Messi, through injury, on to seven points after four games, while Valencia have four.\n\n\u201c[Fati] is a player that has something special,\u201d the Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, said. \u201cHe is a striker who is mature beyond his years. He trains like he plays. Today was a bit exaggerated, with him scoring and setting up a goal with his first touches. But we have to give him time. He is still growing up and has to handle a situation which is far from normal.\u201d\n\nReal Sociedad, roared on by a record crowd in their revamped and completed stadium, ended La Liga leaders Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s 100% start to the season with a deserved 2-0 win. The former Real Madrid player Martin \u00d8degaard put the Basque side ahead in the first game at the renovated Reale Arena with a deflected shot in the 58th minute which completed a sweeping end-to-end attack.\n\nThe debutant Nacho Monreal doubled Sociedad\u2019s advantage three minutes later, pouncing on a fumble by the Atl\u00e9tico goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, who later had to be substituted despite protests from the Slovenian after taking a blow to the head. Real Madrid are second behind Atl\u00e9tico after a nervy 3-2 home victory over Levante.\n\nRB Leipzig came from a goal down to snatch a 1-1 draw against the champions, Bayern Munich, to remain top of the Bundesliga, a point ahead of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Bayern, who host Red Star Belgrade in their Champions League group opener next week, got off to a perfect start when Robert Lewandowski struck in the third minute for his seventh goal of the campaign.\n\nYet, despite more than 75% possession in the first half, the Bavarians failed to make their dominance count as the hosts levelled on the stroke of half-time with an Emil Forsberg penalty. Bayern thought they had grabbed a winner in stoppage time but Niklas S\u00fcle\u2019s header scraped the post and sailed wide.\n\nLeipzig, who face Benfica in the Champions League, are on 10 points, with Dortmund, who crushed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, on nine. Bayern are a further point behind in third.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marco Reus celebrates scoring Dortmund\u2019s fourth.

The visitors had Rodrigo De Paul sent off in the 35th minute following an off-the-ball incident involving Inter\u2019s Antonio Candreva. Sensi\u2019s superb effort from Diego God\u00edn\u2019s cross proved enough for the home side, who extended their perfect start to the new season to three games.\n\nFiorentina were left to rue missed chances after holding Juventus to a 0-0 Serie A draw in Florence to end the champions\u2019 perfect start to the season. Juve arrived at the Stadio Artemio Franchi having won their opening two games and were heavy favourites against a Fiorentina side on zero points. The draw extended Fiorentina\u2019s run of Serie A games without a victory to 17, their worst run in the competition since 1970-71.\n\nNeymar scored a spectacular goal with a bicycle kick two minutes into stoppage time to give Paris St Germain a 1-0 win over Racing Strasbourg but was booed by fans angry with him for trying to force a move back to his former club Barcelona during the summer.\n\n\u201cI had my reason, I wanted to leave, that is clear,\u201d Neymar told reporters after the match. \u201cI did all I could, but they wouldn\u2019t let me. But I am not going to go into details, the page has turned. This is the first time I am saying this and it will be the last, because my head is now dedicated to Paris and I hope to help my teammates in our games.\u201d", "description": "Ansu Fati, 16, scored a goal and made another as Barcelona beat Valencia 5-2 while the Bundesliga leaders, RB Leipzig, came from a goal down for a 1-1 draw against Bayern Munich", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0064ea6ed370711c87763ad0e9996d79e40ef19e/0_75_3197_1919/master/3197.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88c34e9608d726a2f51bc8de938aff56", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
