It now sets the stage for a continued legal battle over the future of affirmative action in higher education.\n\n\u201cThe Court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better,\u201d U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs wrote in a ruling issued Tuesday, rejecting claims that Harvard had discriminated against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process.\n\nThe suit \u2014 brought by Students for Fair Admissions, which is led by conservative anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum \u2014 argued that Asian-Americans were held to a higher standard than students of other races. Harvard data released during the trial showed that admitted Asian-American students have a higher average SAT score but a lower rate of admission than any other racial group.\n\nBlum \u2014 who also brought a suit against the University of Texas at Austin that resulted in a 2016 Supreme Court ruling upholding its affirmative action program\u2014 is currently pursuing a similar claim alleging discrimination against Asian-American applicants at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

And part of that is to train a diverse leadership group and give opportunities to a diverse student body, and that\u2019s very, very important for institutions, especially the public ones. So it\u2019s a tricky balance here, and that\u2019s why these cases don\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nChang has served as an expert witness on behalf of UNC in the Students for Fair Admissions case against the public university.\n\nA February report by Pew Research Center found that a majority of Americans (73%) say colleges should not consider race or ethnicity in admissions. But critics of the Harvard suit have warned that ending race-conscious admissions will ultimately harm black and Hispanic students, who are already underrepresented at top universities.\n\nThis year, as the trial drew national attention, Harvard admitted an incoming freshman class comprised of a record 25.4% Asian-American students \u2014 up from 22.7% last year. Asian-Americans make up about 5% of public high school students in the U.S. By comparison, black students made up 14.8% of Harvard\u2019s admitted students this year, and Hispanic students made up 12.4% \u2014 though both groups of students make up larger percentages of public school enrollment in the U.S.\n\nThe Harvard decision comes amid heightened scrutiny over the fairness of the college admissions process at elite schools in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s making really clear, I think, how warped this idea of going to selective institutions has become,\u201d says Chang.\n\nIn March, federal prosecutors announced charges over a widespread scheme in which dozens of wealthy parents bribed college athletic coaches and facilitated cheating on standardized tests to get their children into elite colleges, spending millions of dollars in some cases. The scandal shed light on the kinds of advantages \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 that give wealthy students a leg up in the admissions process.\n\nIn April, the medical school at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center announced it would stop considering race in admissions, based on an agreement with the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. The Trump Administration has also opened investigations into whether Yale and Harvard discriminate against Asian-American students in admissions.\n\nBurroughs\u2019 ruling won\u2019t bring an end to the contentious debate over affirmative action in admissions.\n\n\u201cStudents for Fair Admissions is disappointed that the court has upheld Harvard\u2019s discriminatory admissions policies,\u201d Blum said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe believe that the documents, emails, data analysis and depositions SFFA presented at trial compellingly revealed Harvard\u2019s systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants.\u201d\n\nHe said Students for Fair Admissions will appeal the decision to the First Court of Appeals and to the U.S Supreme Court \u201cif necessary.\u201d\n\nIn previous decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled that universities are allowed to consider race as one limited factor in admissions, but could not use a racial quota system. But some legal observers think a newly conservative makeup on the Court could result in a ruling against affirmative action in the future.\n\n\u201cBig-picture-wise, it\u2019s really a fight over the way in which the 14th Amendment in the U.S. Constitution gets to be interpreted in what it means to have equal protection,\u201d Liliana Garces, an associate professor of education at the University of Texas at Austin who studies diversity in higher education, said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThis is a very concerted effort to go back to \u2026 the Supreme Court, in its changed composition, with the votes to potentially change that prior interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "A judge ruled Harvard's race-conscious admissions policy constitutional, rejecting claims of discrimination against Asian-Americans.", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/harvard-admissions-ruling-affirmative-action.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
