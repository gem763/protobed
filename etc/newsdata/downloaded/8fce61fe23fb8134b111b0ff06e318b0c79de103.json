Add Interest\n\nReading the stunning, unanimous decision that Johnson acted unlawfully when he suspended, or prorogued, Parliament this August in the lead-up to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, the 74-year-old Lady Hale ruled the prime minister's actions \"void and of no effect.\"\n\nBorn Brenda Marjorie Hale in Yorkshire, Lady Hale attended a state school before earning a place at the prestigious University of Cambridge.\n\nAfter a career as a lawyer and judge, Lady Hale was appointed to the House of Lords, later becoming one of the first justices and only woman on the newly established U.K. Supreme Court in 2009.\n\nLady Hale made history again in 2017 when Queen Elizabeth appointed her the president of the court, the first woman to hold the position.\n\nTuesday's monumental decision is not the first time Lady Hale garnered significant attention in her position. In 2017, in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, the president of the Supreme Court delivered the decision that then-Prime Minister Theresa May could not leave the European Union without first securing a confirmatory vote from Parliament withdrawing the country from the organization.\n\nAn advocate against sexism in the judiciary, she has called out her fellow justices, saying the U.K.'s legal institutions are \"not only mainly male, overwhelmingly white, but also largely the product of a limited range of educational institutions and social backgrounds.\"\n\nKnown for her distinctive brooches, Lady Hale set social media a buzz with the giant spider brooch she wore Tuesday while delivering the Supreme Court's verdict.\n\nCan we not lose sight of what's important here: what an absolute brooch icon Lady Hale is pic.twitter.com/I0IAx4TE3M \u2014 Ed Brody (@chiefbrody1984) September 24, 2019\n\nSome commentators have speculated whether Lady Hale was trying to send a message with her stylistic choices:\n\nLady Hale demonstrating the potential for vast novelistic sub-narratives offered by a correctly chosen brooch.
