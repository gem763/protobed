To celebrate Robbie Williams turning 40, his place of birth has come up with a specially designated route that promises to take fans on a tour of the landmarks where the young singer spent his childhood.\n\n\n\nGutted: Robbie Williams will stay in LA for his 40th birthday but Stoke will party anyway, launching a tourist trail in his honour\n\nIncluded are Vale Park, home to Port Vale, the crooner's favourite football team; houses he used to live in and The Queen's Theatre, where he once trod the boards as the Artful Dodger in Oliver! A bus tour is also planned on the weekend of his actual birthday, February 13th.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the ultimate accolade comes in the form of a blue plaque, which will be unveiled in front of the singer's parents in a ceremony in a park in the Tunstall area of the city.\n\n\n\nEssential viewing: The Port Vale ground where Robbie supported his team as a child\n\nAlthough Williams used his blog to express his gratitude for the acknowledgement, he won't be in attendance, blaming a 'surprise few days' planned in LA by his wife Ayda Field.\n\n\n\nThe singer said: 'She\u2019s gutted, I\u2019m gutted and we all wish that we could be there. I've got a work trip to Australia immediately after which makes it a geographic impossibility because I'm in LA right now.'\n\nHe added: 'When my dad first started to tell me about the plans to honour my birthday I thought it was going to be a small affair.\n\n'But as the weeks have gone on it seems that things have somewhat snowballed. I actually can't get my head around it.\n\n'It all feel like it's happening to someone else, someone who's far more deserving.'\n\nPete Conway, Williams' father, told local paper The Sentinel that he was a 'very proud dad'.\n\n\n\n'It's wonderful. I am looking forward to it. It's quite incredible to see the civic honours being bestowed on Rob.'", "description": "Stoked!
