The North Korean federation said they will treat our team just the same as the other teams in Group H.\u201d\n\nA first competitive meeting in Pyongyang would be symbolic as the two countries are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\n\nDuring qualification for the 2010 World Cup, North Korea chose to host games against South Korea in Shanghai.\n\nNorth Korea sits on top of the group with two wins from its opening two games in the second round of Asian qualification, including a win in Pyongyang against Lebanon. South Korea has played only one game so far, winning 2-0 in Turkmenistan.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Korea has confirmed that it will play its upcoming World Cup qualifier against North Korea in Pyongyang, allaying concerns that the Oct. 15 game would be moved elsewhere.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Duerden"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
