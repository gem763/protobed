In the District, the advent of sports betting has been held up by controversy over a no-bid contract. (Wayne Parry/AP)\n\nA D.C. Superior Court judge has extended a temporary order blocking the District from moving forward on a controversial no-bid contract with a Greek company to manage the city\u2019s planned foray into online sports betting.\n\nA lawsuit filed last month by Dylan Carragher, a D.C. resident and the founder of a sports betting technology business, said the $215 million contract with Intra\u00adlot violates federal law because District officials awarded it without competitive bidding. Last week, a Superior Court judge granted Carragher a temporary order blocking the contract.\n\n[Court temporarily halts District\u2019s contract on sports betting]\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday, a different Superior Court judge, John Campbell, extended the restraining order until Oct. 18, saying he hoped to decide on the lawsuit by then without a lengthy legal process.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that we might as well just grapple with the issue,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe merits are what they are. The legal argument is fairly straightforward.\u201d\n\nThe judge allowed existing D.C. Lottery operations by Intralot to proceed. The company has held the contract to operate the city\u2019s lottery for the past decade.\n\nThis summer, the D.C. Council narrowly voted to suspend competitive bidding rules and allow Intralot to continue running the lottery but also manage the city\u2019s planned foray into online sports gambling.\n\nAt issue in the lawsuit is whether by suspending competitive bidding rules for the contract, District officials violated the Home Rule Act, which established local government in the capital.\n\nUnder the Home Rule Act, the District\u2019s chief financial officer is to carry out his office\u2019s procurement of goods and services but must follow District procurement law. Carragher\u2019s lawyer, Donald Temple, argues that because the D.C. Lottery falls under the purview of the chief financial officer, the D.C. Council was not entitled to exempt the contract from the procurement law.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to declare the contract in violation of law and to order the District to bid out the work \u201cin a fair, open, and transparent procurement process in accordance with the D.C. Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010.\u201d\n\nIn his legal challenge, Carragher said his business was not afforded an opportunity to compete in the D.C. sports wagering marketplace. He also said, as a taxpayer, he was harmed by the District\u2019s decision to circumvent competitive bidding because it eliminated the possibility of securing a better deal for taxpayers.\n\n[D.C. Council approves no-bid sports gambling contract]\n\nIn a brief filed this week, D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine\u2019s office said Temple\u2019s argument relies on a \u201cstrained reading of the Home Rule Act.\u201d\n\nThe Home Rule Act doesn\u2019t prevent the D.C. Council from amending District procurement law, which District lawyers argue is what the council did by exempting the sports betting contract from the law.\n\n\u201cIn the Home Rule Act, Congress stated that the CFO must follow the procurement law established by the Council, but nothing prevents the Council from amending or creating exemptions to that procurement law,\u201d the District\u2019s brief said. \u201cUltimately, there is no indication that Congress intended to constrain the Council\u2019s authority to legislate with respect to one category of procurements \u2014 those involving\u201d the chief financial officer.\n\nTemple told the judge that he would file a response to the District\u2019s brief within a week. In an interview after the hearing, he disputed the District\u2019s assertion that exempting the contract from procurement law is equivalent to amending the law itself.\n\nIn pushing for a no-bid contract this year, the District\u2019s chief financial officer, Jeffrey DeWitt, argued that it would allow the city to quickly launch and tax sports betting ahead of neighboring Maryland and Virginia, neither of which has legalized the practice.\n\nTop executives at two of the country\u2019s largest mobile sports betting platforms, FanDuel and DraftKings, argued against a monopoly model for the District, saying that an open, competitive market of licensed sports betting operators would yield the most revenue for the city and deliver a better product to consumers.\n\n[The firm that got a big chunk of D.C.\u2019s contract has no employees]\n\nAn investigation by The Washington Post found that the business Intralot has listed as its main subcontractor, Veterans Services Corp., had no employees, and that its website touted executives who didn\u2019t work there. The small firm\u2019s chief executive is an employee of Intralot\u2019s subsidiary, DC09, and lives in Maryland. Local law requires companies with large public contracts to share some of that work with small local firms as a way to strengthen the local economy and grow jobs.\n\nThe deal with Intralot divided D.C. Council members, but in July they approved the contract with Intralot in a 7-to-5 vote. Several council members on the losing side of the vote have said the lawsuit validates their concerns.\n\nD.C. Lottery officials say the lawsuit is delaying the intended January 2020 start date for a citywide mobile sports wagering app and hurting small businesses that hope to profit from the betting.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe little firm with a big chunk of gaming contract has no employees\n\nTwo D.C.
