Since then, they\u2019ve managed barely a drip.\n\nThe 2-0 series lead they held that night seems so long ago.\n\nThe Houston Astros won Game 5 of the World Series Sunday night, 7-1, and now lead Washington three games to two. They stand one win away from their second World Series title in three years \u2014 and they get to play the rest of the series back in Houston.\n\nA pair of early Astros home runs brought in two runs apiece and the Nationals\u2019 bats never caught up.\n\nWashington mustered only four hits, and Astros ace Gerrit Cole held 15 straight batters hitless from the end of the second inning until the seventh. Juan Soto hit his second home run of the series in the seventh, a solo shot that barely snuck over the centerfield fence.\n\nBut at the end of that inning, with a full count, two outs and a runner on base, Victor Robles was called out on strikes for a pitch that registered high and outside on the telecast\u2019s pitch tracker. Nationals fans in the sold-out crowd of 43,910 recognized the judgment error, too, and booed home plate umpire Lance Barksdale the rest of the night.\n\nCalls alone can\u2019t explain away how cold Washington\u2019s bats are. Across the three World Series games played in the District, the Nationals combined to score three runs and went just 1-for-21 with runners in scoring position.\n\nWith Max Scherzer scratched from his scheduled start due to neck spasms that left his pitching arm unusable, Joe Ross was given the ball. He gave up five hits over five innings, but Yordan \u00c1lvarez struck a sinker in the second inning to pick up the game\u2019s first two runs, and Carlos Correa homered in the fourth on a pitch that Ross left in the middle of the zone.\n\nGeorge Springer added a two-run shot off Daniel Hudson in the top of the ninth for insurance.\n\nThe teams will meet again in Houston Tuesday night for Game 6. For the Nationals, it will be a familiar spot \u2014 their season on the line.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
