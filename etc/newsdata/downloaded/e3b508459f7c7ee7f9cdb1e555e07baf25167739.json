Through these regulatory amendments, Treasury is denying Cuba access to hard currency, and we are curbing the Cuban government\u2019s bad behavior while continuing to support the long-suffering people of Cuba.\u201d\n\nThis is the second round of steps to tighten pressure on Cuba in recent months as President Trump tries to reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s moves to normalize relations with Havana, policies that Trump has called \u201cterrible and misguided.\u201d\n\nWhite House national security adviser John Bolton said in an April speech in Miami that new travel and financial restrictions were being put forward. In June, the administration followed up with Treasury Department orders that ended authorization for certain group travel to Cuba and for individuals making educational visits. Tourist travel has long been prohibited under U.S. law.\n\nThe latest change sets a $1,000 cap on the money any one person can send to a Cuban family member every three months, and prohibits all remittances to relatives who are Cuban officials or members of the Cuban Communist Party. Nonfamily remittances are prohibited.\n\nCurrently, there are no limits on the amount or frequency of remittances under rules that took effect when the Obama administration normalized relations with Cuba in 2014, ending five decades of Cold War hostility between the two nations. The payments amount to billions added to the struggling Cuban economy each year.\n\n\u201cIn line with the President\u2019s foreign policy on Cuba, these actions are designed to target the Cuban regime while continuing to provide vital relief to the long-suffering people of Cuba,\u201d a statement issued by the State Department said.\n\n\u201cRemittances to private businesses, human rights groups, religious organizations and other self-employed individuals operating in the nonstate sector are authorized with no cap,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe new rules also prohibit banks from processing U-turn transactions, which originate and end outside the United States. The ban could affect insurers that have provided coverage for foreign companies offering investment opportunities in Cuban state-owned enterprises.\n\nWith new restrictions under Trump, any hopes of an economic boom in Cuba, ushered in by an evolved relationship with the nearby United States, have vanished.\n\nCuba is a one-party socialist state, and its constitution enshrines the Communist Party as the \u201csuperior ruling political force in society and the State,\u201d though some modest social and economic reforms have been permitted.\n\nEarlier administration actions prohibited financial transactions by U.S. citizens with hundreds of businesses and individuals deemed to be part of the Cuban government, allowed U.S. citizens to sue the Cuban government for expropriated properties, and effectively ended cruise ship and other travel opportunities opened under Obama. Commercial airlines are still allowed to fly to Cuba.\n\nNeither the Trump administration nor Cuba, however, has reneged on a January 2017 migration agreement, under which Cuba agreed to accept migrants deemed inadmissible to the United States and the United States revoked the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy, which allowed entrance to any Cuban reaching U.S. shores.\n\nAlthough the number of Cubans attempting to flee the island by sea directly to the United States has dropped, the number waiting for asylum interviews at the U.S.-Mexico border is now in the thousands. This year, the administration has deported hundreds of Cubans back to the island, including a planeload of 120 last week.", "description": "The changes cap family remittances at $1,000 a quarter and bar sending money to Communist Party members.", "authors": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department", "Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QLHTOWGQXQI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
