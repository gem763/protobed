Source: Australscope\n\nWhat was happening?\n\nAfter the initial shock passed, Edith and Raul began to work out what had caused their now-three-year-old daughter to be born with blonde hair and fair skin.\n\nThey were surprised to learn that they are both carriers of the albinism gene.\n\nIn fact, they both have distant relatives that have albinism.\n\nFrom there, they learnt that Tatiana\u2019s albinism means that she has little to no pigmentation in skin, hair and eyes.\n\nThe condition also means that the little girl has poor vision, a low depth perception, nystagmus, involuntary eye movement, and photophobia, light and glare sensitivity.\n\nTatiana often gets stopped by people because of her white-blonde hair.

So far, it seems like she gets it.\u201d\n\nMariah is always there to support her little sister. Source: Australscope\n\nWhy do people think Tatiana is different?\n\nTatiana\u2019s big sister Mariah has also helped the little girl feel confident about who she is.\n\nMariah is an especially big help when they take Tatiana to a new place - calming her down and giving her some time to adjust to her new surroundings.\n\nAlthough Mariah doesn\u2019t quite understand why people think her sister is different, she makes sure that Tatiana doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s falling behind.\n\nMariah also has shirts that tell people that Tatiana has albinism.\n\nThe family often gets questions about who Tatiana's dad is. Source: Australscope\n\n\"Every party has a pooper\"\n\nDespite this, the family is often questioned about Tatiana\u2019s white hair and if Raul is really her father.\n\n\u201cFor the most part everyone is genuinely shocked and fascinated by her hair colour,\u201d Edith said.\n\n\u201cBut once in a while I get the very judgmental looks and the snarky questions, but it doesn't really bother me; every party has a pooper.\n\n\u201cI have made it a point to teach anyone that comes across as interested and eager to learn with the continuous support of our friends and family.\u201d\n\nEdith is determined to educate everyone about albinism. Source: Australscope\n\n\"Everyone is different\"\n\nIt's for this reason that Edith is so passionate about raising awareness about albinism.\n\nShe advocates for the condition online, even making a handmade children's book to educate Tatiana's friends about albinism.\n\n\u201cI will do everything in my power to raise awareness for Tatiana and every person that follows her,\" she said.\n\n\"We are in this albinism community and together we will raise awareness.\n\n\u201cResearch; ask questions and become aware of albinism or any condition and how it affects people. Everyone is different and can be affected differently.\n\n\u201cThey do not have red eyes; it is the blood vessels that are visible due to the lack of pigmentation. Remember that they're born this way; they don't know any different. Identify their strengths and work on their difficulties, support them.\u201d\n\n\"Everyone is genuinely shocked and fascinated by her hair colour\".
