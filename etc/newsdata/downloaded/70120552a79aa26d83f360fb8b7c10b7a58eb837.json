The plunge began on the back of weak manufacturing data out of the U.S. and was compounded by news of impending tariffs and bleak economic forecasts for Germany.\n\nThe White House released a list of EU products it plans to target with tariffs on Wednesday, intensifying the Trump administration's global trade battles.\n\nThe decision came after the World Trade Organization (WTO) granted the U.S. permission to tax as much as $7.5 billion of European exports annually. The U.S. first raised its case with the WTO in 2004, claiming that cheap European loans for Airbus had amounted to illegal state subsidies.\n\nThe WTO found in favor of the U.S. on Wednesday, paving the way for tariffs on EU goods.\n\nWashington will impose 10% charges on Airbus planes and 25% duties on French wine, Irish and Scotch whiskies and cheese from across the continent. The tariffs are set to take effect from October 18.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing EU levies on steel and aluminum and a threat by Trump to penalize EU cars and car parts. The prospect of the EU responding in kind to the U.S. is likely to fuel concerns about slowing global growth.\n\nThe action escalates conflicts the Trump administration has waged around the globe as it tries to get major trade partners to change their practices. The U.S. is also locked in a trade war with China as it struggles to strike a new agreement with the world's second-largest economy.\n\nOn the data front, France and Germany are set to report Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for September shortly after the opening bell.\n\nFigures out of Spain showed that its services sector grew at a slower pace in September, cooling from August's five-month high to come in at 53.3, down from 54.3. Figures above the 50 mark represent growth.\n\nThe euro area is expected to release a final reading of Markit Services PMI data for September at around 9:00 a.m. London time.\n\nIn terms of individual stocks, France's Remy Cointreau jumped 6.8% in early trade while Britain's DS Smith, WPP and Taylor Wimpey all fell by more than 3%.", "description": "European stocks were mixed Thursday morning after the U.S. announced it would impose billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on exports from the European Union.", "authors": ["Elliot Smith Sam Meredith", "Elliot Smith", "Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105972414-1560778182369gettyimages-1017772526.jpeg?v=1560778247"}
