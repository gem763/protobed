It\u2019s a great conversation starter, if nothing else.\u201d\n\nIn his left hand, Bryer has embedded a radio-frequency identification chip the size of a grain of rice with his USC student ID and phone contact information. In his right hand, he\u2019s got a password manager and links to his social-media accounts. He also put LED lights in each hand that blink from beneath his skin when a keypad or phone has been connected.\n\n\u201cI can rewrite them as many times as I want,\u201d said Bryer. \u201cMaybe my workplace will have me scan in with a badge, or I could hook these up to my door lock at home or use it to get into my car.\u201d\n\nThe site, Bryer said, recommends that people get the implantation done by a piercing shop, but sends customers \u201ceverything you would need to do it yourself.\u201d\n\nBryer\u2019s biohacking experiment was first reported by his school\u2019s student newspaper, The Daily Gamecock.\n\n\u201cI just did it at my desk,\u201d he told the student paper, \u201cwith a pre-sterilized syringe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are putting a needle into your skin so of course it\u2019s going to hurt a bit,\u201d said Bryer. But in the end, it was no worse than giving blood, and he was guided by members of the forum on the Dangerous Things site, which has frequently asked questions and community projects, along with pages like \u201cWhat is the best way to store cryptocurrency?\u201d\n\nThe site was founded by Amal Graafstra, who wrote the book RFID Toys: Cool Projects for Home, Office, and Entertainment . The chips implement the same technology used for everyday office access cards and contactless payment in stores.\n\nIn 2016, Charlie Warzel wrote the definitive first-person piece about fintech\u2014and biohacking oneself\u2014when he traveled to Stockholm to get a microchip implanted in his hand in what he called \u201ca bid to see for myself what the future of money\u2014as is currently being written by Silicon Valley\u2014might look like.\u201d\n\nThousands of Swedes have opted to replace their keys, credit cards, and even train tickets with the devices since 2015. For his piece in BuzzFeed, Warzel underwent a month-long experiment to live without cash or physical credit cards and, eventually, state-backed currency completely.\n\nAmericans spent upwards of $3.68 billion using tap-to-pay technology in 2014, according to eMarketer. In 2015, that number more than doubled to $8.71 billion, Warzel reported. In 2019, it is expected to hit $210.45 billion, he wrote.\n\nA company in River Falls, Wisconsin, made headlines in August 2017 when it embedded 40 employees with microchips and gave them \u201cI Got Chipped\u201d T-shirts. The company told USA Today that employees would use the device to bypass company badges and computer log-ins.\n\nThose headlines were met with mixed responses from some concerned about surveillance\u2014to be clear, the embeds did not have GPS\u2014but Three Square Market President Patrick McMullan said anyone that worried about privacy should probably just take their cellphone \u201cand throw it away.\u201d\n\nBack at the South Carolina campus, Bryer said he was taken aback by the overwhelmingly positive response from friends and fellow students\u2014especially over the LED lights. But his parents were less excited.\n\n\u201cI told them about it once I had gotten written up by the school newspaper; it\u2019s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d said Bryer, who has always been interested in robotics and hopes to go into software engineering or cybersecurity. \u201cThey weren\u2019t that surprised that I would do something like this, but they were surprised that it was possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say they were confused.\u201d", "description": "In his left hand, the 18-year-old has a radio-frequency identification chip with his student ID and contact information.
