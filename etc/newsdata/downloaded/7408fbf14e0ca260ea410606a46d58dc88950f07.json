The client, Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab, was being prosecuted for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had sought his release. Tillerson refused to intervene, Bloomberg reported, saying it would be illegal interference in a prosecution. Tillerson reportedly complained to then-White House chief of staff John Kelly, and the Justice Department apparently never considered dropping the charges. The report is likely to fuel criticism of Trump's dealings with Erdogan and other autocrats, and adds to a number of serious allegations of improper conduct and potentially impeachable offenses.", "description": "President Donald Trump asked then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to persuade the Justice Department to drop charges against a client of Rudy Giuliani in...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
