I can smell his desperation through the TV,' one brutal tweet read.\n\nA second post read 'Jarrod actually looks better when he's crying', with another claiming the former star's 'baggage stems from deep within'.\n\nDuring the suitor's stint on Bachelor In Paradise in 2018, Angie tweeted: 'I love how serious Jarrod takes himself.

Especially since I know most of them want to be on the show just to pick up chicks once they get the boot.'\n\n'Dross': When a follower told her to 'stop watching this rubbish' during Georgia Love's season in 2016, Angie responded: 'I can't!!
