But the reason why investors are still down on GE\u2019s stock \u2014 despite a fresh round of cost cuts revealed this week \u2014 is rather straightforward.\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t seeing any benefit yet from a year\u2019s worth of operational reshuffling by GE CEO Larry Culp. In effect, all Culp has done thus far is try to mop up the many messes of his predecessors at GE and set the stage for a potentially (though highly uncertain) better free cash flow stream in 2020.\n\nThose are certainly admiral achievements by Culp given the deck of cards he was handed, but not enough to truly excite the majority equity investors. And that logic is on full display this week.\n\nThe struggling GE said Monday it would freeze the pensions of 20,000 U.S. salaried workers, a measure aimed at lowering its pension deficit and cutting debt. GE\u2019s move is expected to cut its pension deficit by about $8 billion and lower debt by up to $6 billion.\n\nGE\u2019s stock initially popped on the news, but closed down slightly on Monday\u2019s session. The stock fell 3% on Tuesday, bringing its one-year decline under Culp to roughly 36% according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.\n\nStuck in a turnaround\n\nCulp\u2019s latest move comes as he visits factories to fine tune how GE operates (with an eye to cost containment), rounds the corner on selling off GE\u2019s biopharma business for $21.4 billion to former employer Danaher and restructures corporate staffing levels. Some high-profile GE investors have applauded his efforts.\n\nEven still, recent commentary from Culp suggests third and fourth quarter earnings results will continue to show a corporate giant stuck in major turnaround mode. Culp has said 2019 is a \u201creset year\u201d and it has been just that. But that doesn\u2019t make it any easier of a pill for investors to swallow.\n\nMeanwhile, not everyone on the Street is sold that the pension freeze is game-changing news for the bottom line.\n\n\u201cBears argue that cash from divestitures is not being directed to benefit equity holders. Instead, GE is boosting long-term care insurance reserves ($5 billion so far, $9 billion to go), repaying debt ($5 billion tender in October), and shoring up pension plans ($4 billion to $6 billion after-tax use of cash announced Tuesday). Management has also mentioned repaying intra-company loans to GE Capital,\u201d wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Obin after the pension freeze news.\n\nObin\u2019s sentiment on GE was shared elsewhere on the Street.\n\n\u201cWe do not perceive this morning's announcement as incrementally positive, considering that now an additional $5 billion-8 billion of asset sale proceeds has to be channeled toward the pension (versus, for example, when GE presented its overall debt reduction target during its March 14 Investor Outlook meeting). During that meeting, pension had not been a formal focus point for deleveraging actions, but has since become so due to declining interest rates,\u201d said veteran GE analyst John Inch at Gordon Haskett.\n\nWolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe was a bit more upbeat. \u201cThis is clearly good news to the extent that GE is managing its liability tail in a more creative way, and theoretically this path remains open going forward. \u2026 This is an important reminder that any residual concerns around balance sheet liquidity and distress are over-stated.\u201d\n\nThe next test for GE\u2019s stock: Oct. 30 earnings day.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
