Democrats say no vote is necessary.\n\nNeeded for impeachment probe?\n\nDouglas Letter, a lawyer for the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee, contended Tuesday that a formal impeachment inquiry was under way for the simple fact that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it is.\n\n\"We have said it in our briefs and I am saying it to you now,\" Letter said, \"the House under the Constitution sets its own rules and the House has sole power over impeachment.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that judicial proceedings take place not in Congress but in court before a judge or magistrate. A Trump administration lawyer argued Tuesday that Democrats have had a \"shifting rationale\" in arguing why they need the documents, especially because the government had already turned over material from the investigation.\n\n\"We feel that there has been really no showing of particularised need,\" said Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Shapiro.\n\nLetter said the materials are needed for the impeachment inquiry to further investigate what Trump knew or said about Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe said the information already disclosed by the Justice Department, including limited summaries of FBI witness interviews, is woefully insufficient. He noted that the interview summary of one of the most crucial witnesses, former White House counsel Don McGahn, had not yet been disclosed.\n\n\"This is not a situation of us getting all sorts of materials,\" Letter said. \"We're getting almost nothing\".\n\nIt was not clear when Howell might rule, though she repeatedly appeared sceptical of the Justice Department's reasoning for not disclosing the material.\n\nHowell said she was concerned that withholding the documents, coupled with the Justice Department's adherence to its policy that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, could result in the public never knowing what investigators found.\n\nThe judge ordered Shapiro to disclose by Friday whether the Mueller team disclosed grand jury information when it requested assistance from foreign countries during its investigation, and if so, how often that occurred.\n\nHowell said she was trying to establish whether the Justice Department was refusing to give Congress information it had already disclosed to other nations.", "description": "Lawyers say the materials from the previous investigation are needed for the current House impeachment inquiry of Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/732bcb82b7144cdd9e365e863ed2e636_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
