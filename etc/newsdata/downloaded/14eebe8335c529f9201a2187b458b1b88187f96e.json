Just ask Twitter user Pieter Gunst. He faced \u201cthe most credible phishing attempt I\u2019ve experienced to date,\u201d he wrote, outlining the steps that almost fooled him. His ordeal is a reminder that even the most cautious people can be targeted by increasingly sophisticated scammers.\n\nOooof. Was just subjected to the most credible phishing attempt I've experienced to date. Here were the steps: 1) \"Hi, this is your bank. There was an attempt to use your card in Miami, Florida. Was this you?\" Me: no. \u2014 Pieter Gunst (@DigitalLawyer) October 7, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened: Gunst got a call from someone claiming to be from his bank, asking him if he had used his card in a far-away city. When he said he hadn\u2019t, the caller \u201cblocked\u201d the transaction and asked for Gunst\u2019s member number, which he explained in the thread is a customer number \u2014 not a bank account number.\n\nThe person on the phone said they were sending a \u201cverification PIN\u201d that Gunst read back after receiving from the phone number he associates with his bank. He later realised that the scammer was resetting his password with the verification number they sent to Gunst\u2019s phone. The scammer read off a few other charges, Gunst confirmed he had made them, and the scammer said, \u201cThank you! We now want to block the PIN on your account, so you get a fraud alert when it is used again. What is your PIN?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Gunst knew for sure that something was up. He hung up and called his bank\u2019s fraud department directly. Giving out his PIN would have allowed the scammer to withdraw money from his account, had he not realised something was amiss.\n\n\u2014> Needed the pin to send money, failed at that step.\n\n\u2014> Everything before the \"what is your pin\" seemed totally legitimate. English was perfect. The bank verification code, sent by the expected number, tricked me.\n\n\u2014> The asking for my pin over the phone... not so much. \u2014 Pieter Gunst (@DigitalLawyer) October 7, 2019\n\nWhile Gunst's example happened in the United States, these scam attempts are common all over the world. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Scamwatch (ACCC) says there were 2384 reported cases in August 2019 alone, totalling $107,720 in financial losses for Australians due to successful phishing attempts. In 2019, there have been 16,082 reports of phishing with Australians reporting around $891,556 in financial losses.\n\nThe ACCC Scamwatch's advice for avoiding these scams: Never give out account or identity-related numbers over the phone. If you\u2019re asked to confirm one of these numbers, don\u2019t do it \u2014 it\u2019s a trick.\n\nIn some cases, the scammer might be asking for you to fill out a customer survey or asking for your customer records because a supposed technical error wiped out their customer database. But once your information has been revealed, there\u2019s no telling what else they could do with it. Not only could your cash be on the line \u2014 your identity could be at risk, too.\n\nIf you suspect you\u2019re being targeted by a scammer, hang up and file a complaint online with Scamwatch.\n\nAs for Gunst, he wrote that he reset all his passwords, filed a police report, and was \u201cgetting additional fraud detection in place.\u201d", "description": "How easy is it to get caught up in a financial phishing scam?
