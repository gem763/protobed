The natural hair \"movement has made it a win-win. You\u2019re still being yourself. You\u2019re still protecting your hair. But you still have so many options to be somebody else.\" (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2017, at a gala luncheon hosted at the opulent Cipriani 42nd Street in New York, Minda Harts found herself seated next to a recruiter for corporate board positions. Over cocktails and a plated fish entree, the two talked about race in the boardroom; the recruiter, a white woman, complained about the challenges of finding black women to be corporate directors.\n\nTo test how she\u2019d respond, Harts, who founded a career development company for women of color and had a book on the topic released in August, asked the recruiter who she would feel more comfortable putting forward as a candidate for a board: a woman of color with a sleek ponytail, or one with a natural hairstyle such as locs or an Afro. The recruiter said the woman with the ponytail, Harts recalled. \u201cThe phrase she used was \u2018clean-cut,\u2019 \u201d Harts said.\n\nHarts said she wasn\u2019t altogether surprised, given the woman had said it was difficult to find black female directors. But it was a reminder that \u201cthese unconscious and conscious biases keep us from even having the opportunity to have a seat at the table. We haven\u2019t even had the chance to introduce ourselves, and there [are] these assumptions of unprofessionalism,\u201d Harts said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: I wear my hair straight probably 99 percent of the time because, being in corporate America, I\u2019ve seen how clients who have braids and natural hairstyles can be looked upon.\u201d\n\nConcern about the damage caused by heat and chemical straightening and the support offered by online communities are contributing to the latest iteration of the natural hair movement, with some black women adopting locs, braids, soft curls and otherwise embracing their cultural heritage.\n\n\n\n\"I love my hair. My hair is my baby in a lot of ways,\" Sam McGee said. \"I take care of it like a child. It's a full time job. I love my hair now, but it's been a process to get to this point. For the longest time I thought if my hair wasn't straight then I wasn't pretty, and it came a lot from my mom, but she didn't mean it, she just didn't know how to deal with my natural hair. My hair is a beast. It's almost untamable. It takes discipline.\" (Whitney Matewe)\n\nSeveral states have recently taken steps to push employers, schools and the broader culture to move with them, and help dismantle a culture of discrimination experienced by black women and men who say they continue to face implicit or explicit pressures to conform, unwelcome comments or even outright discrimination.\n\nNew Jersey, Tennessee, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and other states have proposed legislation to explicitly ban race-based hair discrimination \u2014 tackling a remaining loophole in the law governing discrimination in workplaces, schools and other public places. California and New York were the first to sign legislation into law in July, and New York City issued guidelines on the issue earlier this year.\n\nThe topic has gotten attention from Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg as well. \u201cHair discrimination is racial discrimination, and we ought to recognize that at the national level, too,\u201d he said at Essence Fest, an event produced by the company behind the black women\u2019s magazine.\n\nThe legislation is backed by lawmakers in at least eight states and by a coalition that includes the civil rights groups Color of Change, National Urban League and Western Center on Law & Poverty, as well as the marketing heft of beauty brand Dove. Unilever, which owns Dove and has pointed its focus toward society\u2019s beauty standards for women and featured diverse figures in its campaigns, has also provoked consumer rage, including with a much-criticized ad for body wash.\n\n[After years of \u2018glacial\u2019 change, women now hold more than 1 in 4 corporate board seats]\n\nBlack hair has a long history of being politicized and stigmatized in the workplace \u2014 for men as well as women, said Lori Tharps, a professor at Temple University and co-author of \u201cHair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a black person was going to be part of corporate culture, they would be expected to not only dress the part but dress their hair the part,\u201d Tharps said.\n\nShe said the new laws are getting traction because the latest natural hair movement \u2014 which differs from the protest movements of the 1960s \u2014 has \u201calmost normalized\u201d natural hairstyles such as braids, twists and locs. \u201cWe have a critical mass now,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s been fueled by the Internet, particularly YouTube with its community and how-to videos about wearing natural hairstyles, said Gillian Scott-Ward, a psychologist in New York who directed a 2017 documentary on identity and natural hair.\n\n\u201cIt allowed everyday people to document their natural hair journey \u2014 this is how I wash it; this is how I detangle it; this is how I deal with the fact that my mom wants to disown me; this is how I talk to my boss about it.\u201d\n\nAt a time when diversity issues are getting more attention, employment lawyers say the new state laws did not face significant opposition from the business community. And they said that while some grooming policies may specifically prohibit certain styles, more common are general guidelines that call for \u201cprofessional\u201d or not \u201cextreme\u201d looks that can disproportionately lead to bias against black employees or students.\n\nSuch polices can have an unintended effect on some ethnic groups, said Corinn Jackson, an attorney at Littler Mendelson who represents employers.\n\n[\u2018Ariel ... is a mermaid\u2019: Disney network defends casting black actress in live-action remake of classic film]\n\nPatricia Okonta, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which was not involved in the coalition, said the legislation \u201crecognizes that people should have access to opportunities and resources regardless of their hair texture and regardless of their race.\u201d\n\nThe LDF currently represents a 7-year-old boy and his family in an administrative complaint with the Florida Department of Education after he was denied entry to a private school because of his locs; the organization was also involved in the case of Chastity Jones, a woman who wore her hair in locs and said her job offer was rescinded because of her hairstyle. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear her case last year.\n\nStories alleging hair-based discrimination have gone viral on social media, including Andrew Johnson, a New Jersey student-wrestler who was forced to have his locs cut; Kerion Washington, a Texas teen whose mother said he was not hired at Six Flags because of his hairstyle; and Brittany Noble Jones, a former news anchor in Mississippi who alleged that her decision to wear a natural hairstyle was a factor in her dismissal. In a Medium post, Noble Jones claimed her news director said her natural hair was \u201cunprofessional and the equivalent to him throwing on a baseball cap to go to the grocery store.\u201d\n\nSandra Daniels, a Six Flags representative, said in an email that the amusement park modified its grooming policy this spring and male employees \u201cmay now wear dreadlocks \u2014 provided, per our standard guidelines \u2014 they are well-groomed and do not extend past the bottom of the collar.\u201d Nexstar Broadcasting and its station, WJTV-TV, said in a statement that it stood by its decision, and that Noble Jones was fired for other reasons. \u201cAllegations that Ms. Jones\u2019s employment was terminated for her choice of hairstyles have no basis in fact and are vigorously denied,\u201d the company said.\n\nMost related incidents don\u2019t result in legal action, said Wendy Greene, a professor at Kline School of Law at Drexel University. Lawsuits are expensive and time consuming, and only a few states and municipalities \u201cexpressly prohibit appearance discrimination,\u201d she said in an email. As a result, many lawyers will not advise that their clients pursue a lawsuit \u201cin light of the restrictive interpretations of federal civil rights law\u201d and the gaps in local protections the new laws are trying to fix.\n\n[Even among Harvard MBAs, few black women ever reach corporate America\u2019s top rungs]\n\nStories like that of Jones, the Alabama woman whose case was declined by the Supreme Court, were part of what led Dove to get involved, said Esi Eggleston Bracey, who leads beauty and personal care for Unilever in North America. Bracey spoke about the issue with the National Black Caucus of State Legislators last year, she said in an interview. \u201cI am someone with textured hair and I\u2019ve worn textured hair, and I\u2019m very committed personally to driving this commitment,\u201d she said.\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Holly J. Mitchell (D), who wears her hair in locs, said Bracey\u2019s talk resonated with her own experience and those of young black women in her district. She said her staff suggested drafting legislation, dubbing it the CROWN Act (\u201cCreate a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair\u201d).\n\n\n\n\"It's just allowing your hair to be free,\" Vernita Bediako said. \"I think if it curls, kinks, locs, then that's the form that it wanted to go in; not to put a product in your hair to conform to a style that society deems as appropriate or attractive. It's allowing your hair to be just that, your hair. I've always had locs, and I've always been incredibly in love with the way my hair is, even when I would get teased as a kid. Dreadlocks honestly give you a bout of courage to just step out and show people who you are; it causes you to be transparent.\" (Whitney Matewe)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about hair. It\u2019s about choice and about people being empowered to be who they are culturally in the workplace,\u201d Mitchell said in an interview.\n\nDove\u2019s efforts on the issue follow its long history of cause marketing campaigns focused on beauty standards but also come after an uproar that erupted in October 2017 over an online Dove ad. It depicted a smiling black woman taking off a skin-colored shirt to show a smiling white woman \u2014 an ad many found reminiscent of historically racist imagery. Amid strong backlash, Dove apologized and removed the post with the ad.\n\n[Opinion | Why having black beauty queens with natural curls matters]\n\nBracey and Joy Collective, a marketing firm hired by Dove that noted Dove\u2019s 2017 \u201cembarrassing PR mishap\u201d in text about the CROWN Act that it has since removed from its website, said the current efforts are not a direct response to past ads. \u201cDove has always been dedicated to championing women\u2019s individual beauty so that it is respected and celebrated authentically,\u201d Bracey said in an email. \u201cWhen I joined Unilever in January 2018, my goal was and still is to create systemic change in the beauty industry and to celebrate beauty inclusivity.\u201d\n\nEmployment lawyers say they won\u2019t be surprised if more states adopt the provision or if businesses amend their policies. Companies with employees in multiple states \u201ctend to look at the most restrictive state or state with the most protection\u201d and use that as the default, said Natalie Fujikawa, an attorney for Fisher Phillips.\n\nShe will advise clients to do workplace training that includes discussions about bias or unwelcome comments around hair, conversations that could raise awareness and perhaps make more people comfortable with natural hair styles at work.\n\n\n\n\"Having my hair natural is such an experience because I get to be my raw, authentic self,\" Gabby Hayes said. \"I remember once in high school a girl said, 'Gabby's hair is so nappy, even when she straightens it it's still nappy,' and I remember thinking, 'What does that mean and who taught you that that was okay?' \" (Whitney Matewe)\n\nSome still aren\u2019t. Harts recalls recently getting back from vacation with braided hair and not having time to get it blown straight before a meeting. \u201cI felt uncomfortable \u2014 I felt people were judging me because of the narrative we\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\nMarie Smith, a lawyer in New Jersey, said she\u2019s never been discriminated against at work but until recently wore a wig daily, in part to avoid comments or perceptions from co-workers in an office where there are no other black female attorneys. \u201cFor me it\u2019s been more of a proactive thing,\u201d said Smith, adding she was taught, growing up, to straighten her hair for an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about too many bad reactions to natural hair to be willing to take that risk myself.\u201d\n\nBut with the arrival of the new laws, she\u2019s begun wearing more natural styles in the office. \u201cIt\u2019s 2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept thinking about it \u2014 I was like, \u2018Why am I putting myself through this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Lucrecia Johnson, an attorney in Washington, D.C., recalled the time she was working at a Big Law firm and a white colleague asked if her hairstyle \u2014 twists pinned up on top of her head \u2014 was \u201cheavy\u201d and then reached out to touch it. \u201cI\u2019m not a sideshow,\u201d recalled Johnson, who has since founded her own firm. \u201cWhen you see something you like on people, you don\u2019t reach to touch it, you tell me you like my dress\u201d or hair.\n\nShe thinks it\u2019s great that states are passing such laws, but said lasting change will come from more awareness and cultural shifts. \u201cIt\u2019s a hearts and minds thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more it\u2019s seen [in the workplace], the less likely someone will begin to question it. That\u2019s when the real change will occur.\u201d\n\nLike On Leadership?
