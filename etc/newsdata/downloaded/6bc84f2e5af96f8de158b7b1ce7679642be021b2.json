REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/Files\n\nSindhu won India\u2019s first-ever title at the world badminton championships when she defeated Japan\u2019s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7 21-7 to win the women\u2019s singles in Basel last month.\n\nIt was also an end to Sindhu\u2019s frustrating near-misses, having finished runner-up at the 2016 Olympics, last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and the previous two world championships finals.\n\nWith her silver from Rio, Sindhu is already India\u2019s most successful female Olympian but the latest triumph also boosted the nation\u2019s hopes of a medal in Tokyo next year.\n\n\u201cI think it would be fair to say that she would be one of the big contenders for the gold medal,\u201d Gopichand told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cBut having said that, there is competition, and it just gets more for Sindhu because she will be the target, people have a year to plan against her.\n\n\u201cSo, of course she needs to train, she needs to evolve, she needs to add new thinking to the armoury and that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nWhile India\u2019s field hockey team have won eight Olympic titles, shooter Abhinav Bindra remains the only individual gold medallist for the country of 1.3 billion, who are starved of top sporting success outside cricket.\n\nIn the world championships semi-finals, an aggressive Sindhu dismantled China\u2019s Chen Yufei 21-7 21-14 while it took her just 38 minutes in the final to see off Okuhara with the Japanese player wilting under a barrage of smashes from her opponent.\n\nGopichand was delighted with Sindhu\u2019s aggression and termed the manner of her championship win as \u201cvery special\u201d. He, however, warned her ward to continue to evolve ahead of Tokyo.\n\n\u201cIt will not be fair to say that there is no competition,\u201d Gopichand said.\n\n\u201cI think players like (current Olympic champion) Carolina Marin, Tai Tzu-Ying, Ratchanok (Intanon), the Chinese girls, I think there are a lot of players who will be competition and it\u2019ll be disrespectful to write off competition.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, I think Sindhu has a good chance and hopefully will come with the better medal than last time.\u201d\n\nINDIA IS NO CHINA\n\nBadminton\u2019s popularity has grown by leaps and bounds in the country with Saina Nehwal\u2019s bronze in women\u2019s singles in the London Olympics setting a success path.\n\nWhile the country was toasting the success of Sindhu, the men\u2019s sport also got a significant boost when B. Sai Praneeth won bronze in Basel.\n\nIt was the first world championship medal for a male shuttler since Prakash Padukone won a bronze medal in 1983.\n\nThe likes of Nehwal, Sindhu and Sai Praneeth are all products of the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad where they have prospered under the watchful eyes of the former All England champion.\n\n\u201cSai Praneeth did a very important thing. Sai\u2019s performance was something I am really happy with,\u201d Gopichand said. \u201cSai\u2019s medal got eclipsed by Sindhu\u2019s phenomenal performance.\n\n\u201cI think what Sai has achieved for men\u2019s badminton and the men to actually win a world championship bronze medal is a good starting point to do even better in the future.\u201d\n\nGopichand, however, does not agree that India was badminton\u2019s new China, which has been the dominant force in the sport for decades.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can say that unless we win team events, unless we have depth in all our events and a good bench strength.\u201d", "description": "Pusarla Sindhu will be a strong contender for the women's gold medal at next year's Tokyo Olympics but the 24-year-old's recent World Championship triumph will also make her a target, India's national coach Pullela Gopichand said.", "authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431572987&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0S1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
