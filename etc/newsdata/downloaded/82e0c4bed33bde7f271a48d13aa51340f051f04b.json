Blockchain technology, which is best known as a software-based foundation for cryptocurrencies, would be used in this case to provide transparency about the source of orbital data.\n\nConsenSys Space is a subsidiary of the Brooklyn-based ConsenSys blockchain studio that was founded by Ethereum pioneer Joseph Lubin. Co-founders of ConsenSys Space are Chris Lewicki, who was president and CEO at Planetary Resources; and Brian Israel, who was Planetary Resources\u2019 general counsel.\n\nIsrael said ConsenSys Space currently has seven employees distributed in different parts of the country. Only Lewicki is based in Redmond, he told GeekWire.\n\nIn a statement, Lewicki said Ethereum was a key part of the TruSat system.\n\n\u201cDesigning a system that is at once open, autonomous, and resistant to malicious and erroneous inputs presents considerable engineering challenges,\u201d Lewicki said. \u201cA big part of what makes this possible \u2014 what allows users to have confidence that neither the algorithms nor the output have been tampered with \u2014 is the Ethereum blockchain technology integrated throughout our roadmap.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that the TruSat system is still in early beta mode.\n\nVersion 0.1 of the software, released today, is an engineering prototype with limited features. It\u2019s meant to validate the core software engine that determines a satellite\u2019s orbit based on observations from multiple points on Earth.\n\n\u201cThis first release is primarily for testing by the dedicated community of hobbyists already active in tracking satellites,\u201c Lewicki said.\n\nSuch hobbyists have been trading their reports about orbiting spacecraft \u2014 including classified spy satellites \u2014 for years on online forums such as SeeSat. The initial database for TruSat is seeded with SeeSat observations.\n\nTruSat will serve as an experiment to see whether such observations could form the basis of a trusted, decentralized data management system for space applications. At a reception to unveil the venture, Lubin called TruSat \u201cthe first step in our mission to democratize, diversify and decentralize space endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat could we accomplish in space if we could harness the contributions of every person on Earth wishing to contribute?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat if every fan of \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 \u2018Battlestar Galactica\u2019 or \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 or every space hobbyist, or every stargazer could be part of a citizen space organization, rather than ceding such privileges to nation states or heavily funded companies? \u2026 We formed ConsenSys Space to find out.\u201d\n\nLubin said he\u2019s frequently asked what ConsenSys Space is doing with Planetary Resources\u2019 assets.\n\n\u201cThe person asking generally assumes we\u2019re getting into the business of harvesting the natural resources of celestial bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, as you now know, we\u2019re working to harness the human resources of this celestial body \u2014 all the talent, wisdom and creativity currently sitting on the sidelines \u2014 and convert this potential energy into space progress.\u201d\n\nLewicki told GeekWire that ConsenSys Space wasn\u2019t expecting to profit from the TruSat experiment. \u201cIt\u2019s purpose is a global public good,\u201d he said. However, the experience gained as a result of the experiment could be folded into future ConsenSys Space offerings \u2014 for example, an online marketplace for space data, capable of generating transaction fees.", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 A year after taking over the assets of a Redmond, Wash.-based asteroid mining company known as Planetary Resources, ConsenSys Space has unveiled its first project: an app-based system that makes use of amateur observers and Ethereum blockchain technology to keep track of satellites", "authors": ["Alan Boyle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6_HdqtCce2qi6WBMPG.7HA--~B/aD0zNTU7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/geekwire_312/0bcc030d4f1c227e68f584f9b5b7abde", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
