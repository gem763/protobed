He is devastated. It\u2019s a case one needs to be really familiar with to comment on it. I know the situation very well, but still, I will not comment on it,\u201d said Thierry Fremaux, director of the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nLast year the 83-year-old director won a case in Poland when a refusal to extradite him to the US was upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nPolanski\u2019s withdrawal has been welcomed by feminist groups \u201cOsez le f\u00e9minisme\u201d and \u201cLa Barbe\u201d, as well as the French Minister for Women\u2019s Rights, Laurence Roussignol.\n\nHowever Polanski also had his supporters. One leading actor, Gilles Lellouche, said the scandal over his nomination for the awards made no sense, pointing out that the filmmaker had been allowed to live and work in France for 40 years.\n\nPolanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a minor. He served 42 days in jail but fled America fearing that a plea bargain deal was about to be ditched and a longer sentence imposed.\n\nHis victim, Samantha Geimer, has said she forgives him. But the American justice system has maintained the charges against the director.", "description": "The film director Roman Polanski has pulled out of presiding over the prestigious C\u00e9sar awards in France, following protests over his implication in a rape case involving a\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/355831/1000x563_355831.jpg", "published_at": "2017-01-24"}
