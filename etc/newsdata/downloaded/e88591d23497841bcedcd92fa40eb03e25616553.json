Doesn\u2019t sound too hard, does it?\n\nOh, it does? Yeah, same.\n\nI decided to take on the Sober October challenge, and go the whole month without a drop of alcohol.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I have a problem with alcohol, but like many of us I enjoy a drink at the weekend \u2013 and, ahem, sometimes the week as well \u2013 and I wanted to see how hard it would be to go without. My tipple of choice is generally white wine, but I also recently sank a few beers on a trip to Norway and came back feeling ready for a detox.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s the added benefit of raising money for Macmillan, who have adopted this challenge as their own, and call those of us avoiding the drink \u2013 like me \u2013 their \u2018sober heroes\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t have a fundraising kitty, but I will be donating the cash I would otherwise have spent on drinking to the cancer support charity.\n\nIn the process, I\u2019m hoping to emerge the other side feeling fresh and accomplished.\n\nThere\u2019s just a couple of barriers in the way, like some nights out planned, Halloween and a collection of miniature bottles of wine in the fridge which are calling to me (they\u2019re so small! Those cute packages with little screw tops couldn\u2019t hurt, surely?)\n\nI recruited some help to get me through, in the form of behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings \u2013 who is doing the challenge too.\n\nShe agreed with me that even so-called \u2018alcohol-free\u2019 drinks don\u2019t truly count, as they often have between 0.5 and 2.5% alcohol \u2013 and we\u2019re not doing this sober thing by half measures.\n\nJo reckons that the first week is the hardest, and the third week is pretty hard too as you start to flag.\n\n\u2018By the fourth week you are nearly there and that feeling of achievement is there,\u2019 she told Metro.co.uk.\n\nShe said that if you have events coming up, make a plan and anticipate your triggers in advance.\n\nBehavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings (Picture: Rex)\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re going somewhere with copious alcohol like a wedding, party, or Halloween event, plan what you will seek out instead.\n\n\u2018Drink out of a wine glass like it\u2019s a proper alcoholic drink,\u2019 Jo recommended. \u2018It could trick your mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Have drinks that feel like they\u2019re alcoholic drinks, like soda or tonic with lime in \u2013 something that mimics the drinks you would have had.\u2019\n\nShe advises that like with any challenge, finding people to support you can be crucial.\n\nOne way to do that could be sharing what you\u2019re doing on social media, to give you some accountability and get some support if you\u2019re flagging.\n\n\u2018Take it a week at a time,\u2019 Jo said. \u2018Break it down into weeks, and celebrate the little wins.\n\n\u2018Keep the reasons in your mind. Think of your motivations.\u2019\n\nShe warned that despite the temptation, don\u2019t overdo things once you reach the milestone of November 1.\n\n\u2018Your tolerance to alcohol will have reduced a bit so you will find the effects are a bit stronger,\u2019 she said. \u2018Maybe treat yourself to a cocktail or a glass of champagne, a special drink. But don\u2019t drink more than you would have normally.\u2019\n\nEmily Gay with her mum Andrea (Picture: Emily Gay)\n\nEmily Gay, 24, from south London, is also doing the challenge and has already raised over \u00a31,500.\n\nShe told metro.co.uk she was inspired to do it to raise money because of her mum Andrea, who has a rare cancer called NETS which is often misdiagnosed.\n\nAndrea began having chemotherapy this year as the cancer had spread after she had neuroendocrine tumours removed from her lungs.\n\n\u2018Mum\u2019s health means that she doesn\u2019t have the luxury of being able to go out drinking and dancing all night like we can \u2013 so this year I\u2019m going Sober for October,\u2019 Emily said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said it hasn\u2019t been too hard so far, and she swapped Sprite for alcohol at a beer and pizza evening.\n\n\u2018I have made everyone sponsor me so hopefully I won\u2019t be getting any peer pressure. Usually I\u2019m the first one up dancing anyway so hopefully it will be just as fun without drinking.\n\n\u2018My strategy is to make sure I have got a drink in my hand and that it\u2019s a soft drink. No-one will offer me a drink if they can see I have got one already.\n\n\u2018Over the summer I was probably drinking on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as there was a lot in the calendar, so hopefully this will be a bit of a detox.\u2019\n\nTo sponsor Emily, click here.", "description": "Thirty one days without booze.
