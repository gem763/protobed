Some may never recover, but we are fighting to give them a chance.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that \u201cthousands of children, including many two years old or younger, have been torn from their parents\u2019 arms with little or no warning. In many cases, no explanations were given as to why they were being separated, and no answers were provided as to where the children were taken.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, children were sent to facilities hundreds or thousands of miles away from their parents. Many children and parents did not see each other again for a year or more, the suit alleges.\n\nThe ACLU is representing multiple children and families from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras who were separated along the border in Arizona for up to 16 months. Attorneys are seeking class-action status for the case.\n\nThe lawsuit describes the conditions experienced by children as young as 6, and their parents, once they crossed into the U.S. and were taken into custody. In many instances, the lawsuit alleges parents were tricked into signing removal documents they couldn\u2019t understand.\n\nIn one example, a 7-year-old girl named Diana woke up to find her father gone. He had been taken away from their holding facility in the middle of the night without being given a chance to say goodbye.\n\nIn another example, CBP officers dragged 7-year-old Andr\u00e9s \u201ckicking and screaming\u201d from the arms of his father, Jacinto. An officer told Jacinto that his son now \u201cbelonged to Trump.\u201d\n\nJacinto was eventually deported back to Honduras, and his son was sent to a foster family in New York. According to the lawsuit, they remained separated for 10 months.\n\nIn addition to damages, the lawsuit seeks the creation of a fund to pay for professional mental health services for affected families.\n\nThe lawsuit cites violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable seizure of children), the Fifth Amendment due process clause and equal protection.\n\nAdministration officials had touted the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy as a way to deter migrants from crossing into the U.S. with their children. The policy resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents at the southern border in just six weeks, before it was rescinded last June amid a massive public backlash.\n\nA ruling by a federal judge in San Diego forced the administration to reunite many of the children who were separated under the policy, but that lawsuit has since expanded to include people separated even before the policy took effect.", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy resulted in thousands of traumatized children and parents who were \u201ccruelly and inhumanely separated from each other,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed against the adm", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/immigrant_children_1_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
