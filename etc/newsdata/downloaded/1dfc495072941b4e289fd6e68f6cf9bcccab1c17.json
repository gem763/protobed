This year, the emphasis was on looking at opportunities for Australian and Chinese companies, universities and investors to collaborate on technology and the environment.\n\nThe meetings in Beijing came as Mr Dutton delivered a broadside against China's Communist Party for orchestrating a series of cyber attacks, intellectual property theft and efforts to muzzle academic freedom in technology and and the environment.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy hit back on Friday night, issuing a statement denouncing Mr Dutton for a \"malicious slur\" on Chinese people.\n\nFormer Howard government minister and businessman Warwick Smith said Mr Dutton's comments did not spoil the mood of the delegation's meetings with senior Chinese officials and business people.\n\n\"I felt confident we are travelling well and ultimately [Scott] Morrison is going to be invited to come here, maybe early next year,\" Mr Smith, who heads the new National Foundation for Australia-China Relations, said.\n\nAn Australian prime minister has not visited China since April 2016.\n\n\"He [Dutton] has a hard job to do and he should do it. It is not just for governments to worry about, but business is worried about cyber and hacking as well. That is not a reason not to do business [with China].\"\n\nMr Robb said the biggest opportunities for Australia were in the services sector with concessions already agreed in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, particularly in healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWang Yiming, a vice-minister for the Chinese government's Development and Research Centre told the delegation he would encourage Australian miners such as BHP to invest more in China.\n\nJean Dong, chief executive of the Australia-China Belt and Road Initiative, said the opportunities for doing business with China were shifting away from traditional areas such as property and commodities to the service sector and sharing expertise in technology and climate change initiatives\n\n\"Australian companies have a lot of great expertise in those areas,\" she said. We want to encourage China to look beyond the traditional sectors like property.\"\n\nThe delegation discussed developments in Chinese automation, digital, data, water saving and electric vehicle technologies and potential collaboration in the mining, energy and agriculture sectors.\n\nThere were about 40 representatives from Chinese state-owned enterprises and private mining, energy, agriculture and technology companies, along with Chinese investors and banks.\n\nWhile delegates said business was concerned about cyber security and intellectual property theft, issues which have been raised by authorities in Washington and Canberra, they said this did not mean collaboration on technology between the two countries should stop.\n\nMr Robb said as China made advances in technology it had a greater incentive to lift standards domestically to protect its own innovation. \"It certainly was happening and I'm not saying it doesn't happen. There is an internal incentive to get on top of the IP issues. they have certainty significantly hardened up,\" he said.\n\nWhile trade between China and Australia has increased, direct investment from China into Australia has fallen. A China-government-backed $1.5 billion takeover offer for infant formula group Bellamy's Australia is now facing regulatory and political scrutiny in Canberra,\n\nCanberra is becoming increasingly concerned about China's efforts to build regional influence, cyber hacking and foreign interference in universities. Executives in China say the opportunities from the world's second-largest economy are still huge, but warn that tightening regulations and government interference were big risks.", "description": "Peter Dutton's China comments did not spoil the party for an Australian business delegation in Beijing over the weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3426%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_217%2C$y_75/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/00151f169800d4e167eddc8657783a8bc414d85d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
