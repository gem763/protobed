(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPresident Trump says the United States might go to war to protect Saudi Arabia, amid signs that Iran might have played a role in an attack on Saudi oil fields.\n\n\u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday, \u201cbut are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe idea that the United States military would be at the beck and call of Saudi leaders was odd enough. But then Trump clarified Monday morning that it wasn\u2019t even about us needing Saudi oil. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!\u201d he said.\n\nBecause we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nSo the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president who pledged a noninterventionist foreign policy is threatening to go to a war with little strategic interest for the United States because ... he just wants to help?\n\nThe sentiment is strange in and of itself. But it\u2019s even odder when you compare it with how Trump used to talk about Saudi Arabia. For decades, the Gulf nation was one of Trump\u2019s favorite punching bags \u2014 emblematic of U.S. leaders allowing other countries to walk all over them. And in contrast with the president we see today, he repeatedly derided the U.S. government for protecting it.\n\nThe most direct contradiction to what Trump is saying today is from 2014, when Trump tweeted, \u201cSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won\u2019t, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won't, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2014\n\nEven as he was launching his presidential campaign a year later, he made a point of lifting our relationship with Saudi Arabia up as an example of U.S. foreign policy gone wrong.\n\n\u201cI love the Saudis. Many are in this building,\u201d Trump said after descending the golden elevator in Trump Tower. \u201cThey make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say \u2018we\u2019re gonna protect.\u2019 What are we doing? They\u2019ve got nothing but money.\u201d\n\nBut while those might be the two most discordant notes relative to what we see today, this is a tree Trump had been barking up for three decades.\n\nIn 1987, he paid nearly $100,000 for full-page ads in The Washington Post, the New York Times and Boston Globe that spotlighted Saudi Arabia as a country that was taking advantage of the United States\u2019 patronage.\n\n\u201cThe world is laughing at America\u2019s politicians as we protect ships we don\u2019t own, carrying oil we don\u2019t need, destined for allies who won\u2019t help,\u201d Trump said in the ad.\n\nIn the ad, Trump also said that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Japan and others should pay for U.S. assistance, since they were wealthy enough to provide it for themselves. It would be a demand he would make repeatedly in the years to follow.\n\n\u201cWe have absolute obligations to protect freedom, but we don\u2019t have obligations to protect freedom of countries that are far wealthier than we are,\u201d he said in an ABC News interview talking about the ad.\n\nIn a 1999 Fox News interview, Trump accused the Saudis of being bad partners.\n\n\u201cI mean, the money they make, and then when we wanted to go over and fly our planes and land our planes in Saudi Arabia, in the war, to protect them; they didn\u2019t want us on their land,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you explain that one to me.\u201d\n\nTrump has also repeatedly suggested that the United States is propping up the Saudi government, which would crumble without U.S. help.\n\n\u201cIf we leave Iraq with a wonderful new government in place, it will be overthrown in about 15 seconds, just as the Saudi government would be overthrown in about 15 seconds if we weren\u2019t protecting Saudi Arabia,\u201d Trump said in a 2004 Playboy interview.\n\nTrump criticized both George W. Bush and Barack Obama for their deferential treatment of the Saudis.\n\n\u201cAnd because we have a stupid president they get away with it, I mean, we have a president that goes to Saudi Arabia and wraps his arms around these people and says, you know, \u2018We love you, we love you, we love you,' \u201d he said of Bush in a 2008 appearance on Howard Stern\u2019s show. \u201cThe next day they announce they\u2019re not going to do anything for us.\u201d\n\nWhen Obama was in office, Trump joined with many Republicans in mocking him for bowing to a Saudi king. \u201cDo we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off?\u201d Trump said, before urging people to vote for Mitt Romney on the eve of the 2012 election.\n\nDo we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off? Make America strong, vote for @MittRomney. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012\n\nTrump\u2019s comments on Saudi Arabia have occasionally ventured into the conspiratorial. In the Stern interview above, he accused the Saudis of providing a haven for Osama bin Laden.\n\nTrump said bin Laden was \u201cwalking in the woods of probably Saudi Arabia, in my opinion. I happen to think he\u2019s in Saudi Arabia.\u201d Trump added that, if he were president after 9/11, he \u201cwould have gone into Saudi Arabia and gotten the families of the terrorists.\u201d\n\nTrump in 2012 also accused Obama of taking illicit campaign contributions from the Saudis. And he pointed to Saudi money going to the Clinton Foundation in 2016.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays,\u201d Trump said on Facebook. \u201cHillary must return all money from such countries!\u201d\n\nTrump has also over the years elevated a couple of Twitter followers who called the Saudis names and accused the country of funding ISIS, calling the Islamic State by another name.\n\n\"@kevinb____: @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia is already paying ISIS\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2014\n\n\"@Silverfoxgranny: #SaudiArabia Saudi Arabia are nothing but mouth pieces, bullies, cowards. They have the money, but no guts\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2014\n\nAnd in 2013, he alleged that Saudi Arabia had turned down a seat on the U.N. Security Council because \u201cthey don\u2019t want responsibility. Just have us do their heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nNo surprise Saudis turned down spot on UN Security Council. They don\u2019t want responsibility. Just have us do their heavy lifting. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2013\n\nEven as of October, Trump was telling the Wall Street Journal that the Saudis weren\u2019t paying up. \u201cWe\u2019re defending Saudi Arabia. They have \u2014 they\u2019re a vastly wealthy country, and we\u2019re defending them, and we\u2019re not being reimbursed for our costs. A very small percentage is being reimbursed,\u201d he said.\n\nThat appears to be the last time he has strongly criticized our relationship with the Saudis. Three weeks later, The Washington Post reported that U.S. intelligence had determined the Saudi crown prince ordered Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Trump bent over backward to absolve the Saudis \u2014 particularly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 of direct responsibility.\n\nAnd ever since then, Trump has emphasized the importance of the relationship. It all culminated in his repeated suggestions over the last 24 hours that the United States might go to war for Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe United States is more prepared\u201d for a conflict than any country in history, Trump said Monday afternoon, before adding that he would like to avoid one.\n\nHe would probably argue that they have started paying up, most notably by buying U.S. arms. But he has badly exaggerated the size of those sales. He has also credited the Saudis with helping rebuild Syria, but again, even as of less than a year ago, he said it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nSaudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn\u2019t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018\n\nAnd Trump is sounding at least open to doing some heavy lifting for the Saudis today. But he emphasized Monday that \u201cI haven\u2019t promised the Saudis that,\u201d and, \u201cWe have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out.\u201d\n\nTrump is clearly at risk of looking like the beholden and manipulated American leader he once decried, and he doesn\u2019t really seem to be trying hard to fight that perception. The question is why? Why has Trump pulled such an about-face on the Saudis? Is it because he recognizes the importance of the alliance in a way he didn\u2019t before he was president? That\u2019s certainly not the explanation he gave Monday. In fact, he suggested quite the opposite \u2014 that the United States has no real interest in a conflict there. Nor does it seem that the Saudis have suddenly started paying up, judging by Trump\u2019s comments to the Journal less than a year ago.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t exactly pride himself on rhetorical consistency, but this evolution might be one of his strangest. If Iran were involved in the attack, it would certainly be a highly provocative act, and the U.S. government has an interest in a stable Middle East. But it would not be the kind of conflict that Trump\u2019s past rhetoric suggests he thinks we should be getting involved in, and Trump in many ways seems to be arguing against his former self.", "description": "For decades, the oil-rich country was a villain \u2014 a country that U.S. leaders foolishly defended.
