MPs are expected to get a first chance to debate the merits of the proposals later. The plan has already won the backing of the Conservatives' allies in Northern Ireland, the DUP, while leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker reckons it is \"highly likely\" to get through the Commons. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it's \"not acceptable\", and there has been criticism from other Northern Irish parties, the Scottish Nationalists and Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe plan would see Northern Ireland leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK at the start of 2021, but continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural products and other goods, subject to the Northern Ireland Assembly's approval every four years. A \"very small number\" of physical customs checks would happen away from the border, at business premises or at \"other points in the supply chain\".\n\nBBC Europe editor Katya Adler says some senior EU diplomats regard the proposals as \"better than expected\" and have praised both the tone and aspects of the content. But, they add, \"we're not there yet\". The reaction in Dublin will be key, with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar sounding a sceptical note, while MEPs are expected to outline opposition later. Our Europe editor adds: \"No-one I speak to on the EU-side thinks a new Brexit deal can be done in time for the EU leaders summit in mid-October. Few think it possible even by the end of the month.\"\n\nTrump lashes out over impeachment inquiry\n\nUsing strong language, President Donald Trump has accused congressional Democrats of dishonesty - even treason - over their investigations into claims he tried to pressurise the Ukrainian president into interfering in the 2020 US election. Democrats promise a fair inquiry relating to a phone call in which Mr Trump pressed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic contender Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm. No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has come to light.\n\nAfter a turbulent few weeks for leaders on either side of the Atlantic, our correspondents weigh up whether things really are as tricky as they seem for Messrs Trump and Johnson.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nAsher-Smith wins historic gold at World Championships\n\nDina Asher-Smith wakes up this morning as world champion - and the first British woman to win a major global sprint title - after romping to victory in the World Athletics Championships 200m final in Doha.

But despite the fact that we should be fussing over budgeting and acquiring culinary skills beyond the realms of pasta and Pot Noodle, one of the most stressful decisions surrounding uni for a lot of people is whether or not to remain in their secondary school relationships.\n\nI'm curious about those who are planning to keep their existing partners. Will their relationships survive, or will the romantic possibilities in their new environments be too exciting to turn down?\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThursday's front pages offer varying interpretations of the reaction of EU leaders to Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals. The Financial Times reports a \"frosty\" reception in Brussels, while the Guardian suggests it prompted \"dismay\" from the EU. The Metro, on the other hand, says the prime minister's plan received a \"cautious welcome\", while the Daily Telegraph suggests there is huge pressure on Ireland to accept the compromise. The Times says Brussels is keeping the PM guessing by withholding approval for formal negotiations.\n\nDaily digest\n\nWomen's pensions High Court to rule on discrimination case\n\nSmacking children Scotland to introduce UK's first ban\n\nMedicines Drug exports restricted 'to protect NHS patients'\n\nSpace Force RAF pilot to help launch satellite\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nThe guerrilla tiler brightening up his city\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/BBC\n\nThe Food Chain: How to cook for a megastar\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nImage copyright Lucy Holligan\n\nOur new My Money blog: 'my guilt over a \u00a31.50 tin of tuna'\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\n10:00 The High Court will rule whether nearly four million women born in the 1950s and 1960s were treated unfairly by the raising of the state pension age.\n\n13:00 Funeral of Libby Squire, the university student who went missing at the start of the year.\n\nOn this day\n\n1944 After 63 days of fighting with little outside help, the Polish Home Army surrenders to the occupying Germans.
