That was tied for the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall on record, with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane.\n\nBahamian authorities made a last-minute plea for those in low-lying areas to evacuate. The NHC said Dorian was moving west at 7mph, with \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d in the Abaco Islands and expected across Grand Bahama later in the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really, really bad for the Bahamas,\u201d said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said, adding: \u201cAbaco is going to get wiped.\u201d\n\nHundreds hunkered down in schools, churches and other shelters. Power and water outages were reported, as authorities warned that all government workers would remain indoors once winds reached 40mph.\n\nIn the US, millions from Florida to the Carolinas kept a wary eye on Dorian amid indications it would veer sharply north-east after passing the Bahamas and track up the south-eastern US seaboard.\n\nThe end could be fatal. We ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety Samuel Butler, assistant police commissioner\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Florida from the north of Deerfield Beach to the Volusia-Brevard county line. Hurricane conditions were possible within the watch area by late Monday or early Tuesday, the NHC said, warning that even if its core did not make landfall, the storm would likely hammer coastal areas with powerful winds and heavy surf.\n\nIn the northern stretches of the Bahamas archipelago, hotels closed, residents boarded up homes and officials hired boats to move people to bigger islands. The prime minister, Hubert Minnis, said any \u201cwho do not evacuate are placing themselves in extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence\u201d.\n\nKwasi Thompson, minister of state for Grand Bahama, said: \u201cPlease, please heed the warning. We have no more time available.\u201d\n\nOfficials said dozens were ignoring evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cThe end could be fatal,\u201d said Samuel Butler, assistant police commissioner. \u201cWe ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety.\u201d\n\nAmong those refusing to leave were 32 people in Sweetings Cay and a group that sought safety in Old Bahama Bay resort, which officials said was not safe. Butler said officials were closing certain roads and those on the other side would be stranded. The government had opened 14 shelters.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stress the amount of devastation and catastrophic impact that Hurricane Dorian is expected to bring,\u201d said Shavonne Moxey-Bonamy, the Bahamas chief meteorologist.\n\nOn Saturday, small skiffs shuttled between outlying fishing communities and McLean\u2019s Town, a settlement of a few dozen homes at the eastern end of Grand Bahama, about 150 miles from Florida.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taking no chances,\u201d said Margaret Bassett, a ferry boat driver for the Deep Water Cay resort. \u201cThey said evacuate, you have to evacuate.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anastacia Makey and her family sits on cots with other residents inside a church opened as a shelter, in Freeport on Grand Bahama.

He said it would be the first hurricane he had experienced.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d he said by phone on Sunday as the eyewall approached. \u201cI\u2019m worried about destruction of property, but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be loss of lives here.\u201d\n\nPittard said he battened up his house and was spending the storm in a duplex behind a group of cottages. He noted the ocean was quite deep nearby and there was a cay to provide protection, so he did not expect significant storm surge.\n\nFloridians not fazed as Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path keeps state guessing Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying here,\u201d said Pittard, from Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nGovernment spokesman Kevin Harris said Dorian was expected to affect 73,000 residents and 21,000 homes. Authorities closed airports for the Abaco Islands, Grand Bahama and Bimini, but Lynden Pindling international airport in the capital, Nassau, stayed open.\n\nJeffrey Allen, who lives in Freeport on Grand Bahama, said he had learned that damage predictions sometimes do not materialize, but he still took precautions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you wait with anticipation, hoping that it\u2019s never as bad as they say it will be. However, you prepare for the worst nonetheless,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bahamas archipelago is frequently hit by hurricanes. Construction codes require homes to have metal reinforcements for roof beams to withstand winds into the upper limits of a category 4 hurricane. Compliance is generally tight for residents who can afford it. Risks are higher in poorer communities, which typically have wooden homes and are generally in lower-lying areas.", "description": "Authorities plead with residents to clear low-lying areas as category 5 storm, the strongest recorded in area in modern times, rolls in", "authors": ["Associated Press In Mcleans Town Cay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad84c3c143ba02246c37498996a496af2b3ee091/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7001b6fcebaf51e14a1a39cd35c95565"}
