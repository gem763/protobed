Even then, it was not eradicated: Wild hemp is often called \u201cditch weed.\u201d\n\nThis year, about 1,000 farmers in Illinois applied to grow fewer than 23,000 acres of hemp , according to John Sullivan, the director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture. That is minuscule compared with the acres of corn (11 million) and soybeans (10.8 million) planted last year. But some see it as a necessary alternative.\n\n\u201cOur corn and soybean farmers have lost customers,\u201d Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said. \u201cAnd when you have a large customer and you lose them in a given year, it\u2019s very hard to get them back.\u201d\n\nMr. Huston, who voted for President Trump and intends to do so again, said he believed that the president had good intentions in his trade standoff, although like other farmers, Mr. Huston said he was frustrated and had suffered from its effects.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s a bad way to do business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we end up with better markets at the end of this, it will have been worth it. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s likely.\u201d", "description": "With the rising popularity of CBD products, farmers are growing hemp.
