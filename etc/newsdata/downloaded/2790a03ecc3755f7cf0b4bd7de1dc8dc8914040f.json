We understand there will be consequences, and we\u2019re prepared to take responsibility for them. We know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.\u201d\n\nThe private Christian school in Springfield, Virginia, where tuition is listed at about $12,000 per year, drew headlines after hiring Mrs. Pence to teach art.\n\n\u201cWhile we are relieved to hear the truth and bring the events of the past few days to a close, we also feel tremendous pain for the victims and the hurt on both sides of this conflict,\u201d said Mr. Danish. \u201cWe recognize that we now enter what will be a long season of healing.\u201d\n\nAmong those who weighed in on the now-debunked incident was Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Michigan Democrat, who tweeted on Saturday, \u201cYou are beautiful, Amari Allen. You are courageous & strong. You are loved.\u201d\n\nYou are beautiful, Amari Allen. You are courageous & strong. You are loved.\n\n\n\nYou see, Amari, you may not feel it now, but you have a power that threatens their core. I can\u2019t wait to watch you use it and thrive.\n\n\n\nStay strong. https://t.co/57rtAYby3h \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 28, 2019\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Danish did not say what the consequences would be for the false allegation, but said it showed the school was \u201cnot immune\u201d from society\u2019s \u201cdeep racial wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ordeal has revealed that we as a school family are not immune from the effects of deep racial wounds in our society,\u201d Mr. Danish said. \u201cWe view this incident as an opportunity to be part of a learning and healing process, and we will continue to support the students and families involved.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cWe will also continue teaching what we\u2019ve taught for more than 40 years: that the love of God is for all people, and as His children we should demonstrate that love equally to all people regardless of their background, what they believe, or how they behave.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
