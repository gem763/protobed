The department is almost certain to appeal Howell's decision.\n\nGrand jury material is, by law, normally kept secret.\n\nBut Howell wrote that \"the need for continued secrecy is minimal and thus easily outweighed by [the Judiciary Committee's] compelling need for the material.\"\n\n\"Tipping the scale even further toward disclosure is the public's interest in a diligent and thorough investigation into, and in a final determination about, potentially impeachable conduct by the President described in the Mueller Report.\"\n\nThe Judiciary Committee, Howell said, \"has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry\" and \"that this need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in a statement said, \"I am gratified that the federal district court has ordered that the Special Counsel's grand jury information must be turned over to the House's impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n\"The court's thoughtful ruling recognizes that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary,\" Nadler said. \"This grand jury information that the Administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work.\"\n\nThe House's ongoing impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump's recent pressuring of Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Joe Biden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.\n\nThe president and his emissaries also have urged Ukraine to investigate a right-wing conspiracy theory that says Ukraine was either involved in or helped cover up a scheme to frame Russia for the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers in the runup to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAt the time Trump was urging Ukraine's new president to open those investigations, the White House was withholding nearly $400 million worth of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMueller's own 22-month-long investigation, which ended last March, probed Russian interference in the 2016 election, possible coordination with Russian agents by members of the Trump campaign, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump himself.\n\nThe special counsel concluded that Russia had actively interfered in the election with social media tactics and by releasing emails stolen from the DNC and from officials in Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nBut Mueller also found that there was not sufficient evidence to charge people affiliated with the Trump campaign with conspiring with Russian agents to affect the election.\n\n\"We did not make a determination as to whether\" Trump \"did commit a crime,\" Mueller has said.", "description": "The House is investigating President Donald Trump's pressuring of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as other issues.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan Tucker Higgins", "Dan Mangan", "Tucker Higgins", "In"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106040625-1564078259844mueller.jpg?v=1564078315", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
