Shirtless. Perhaps wearing a towel.\n\nCount a fawning Jerry Jones, the team's owner, among those who think the All-Pro running back can\u2019t do wrong (a fact likely evidenced by the rich extension that the Cowboys owner gave his backfield star). But rather than rave about Elliott\u2019s vision out of the backfield, his good hands or his explosive ability, Jones seemed enthused about Brown\u2019s ability to cut up the rug in the Cowboys locker room.\n\nDuring a Tuesday morning radio interview on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, Jones was asked about Robert Quinn\u2019s sack dance from this past Sunday.

That\u2019s a lot of reasons to dance.\n\nQuinn\u2019s dance came midway through the third quarter of the Cowboy\u2019s Week 3 win over the Miami Dolphins.
