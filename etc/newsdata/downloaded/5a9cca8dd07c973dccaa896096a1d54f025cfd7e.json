(And Apple TV.) Photo: Apple\n\nOn November 1, Apple will unveil its glittering lineup of original television shows, with the prestige you might expect from an A-lister-filled drama about TV news and a show about serious men and women going to space. But there\u2019s also an anomaly: A show about Emily Dickinson, that spinster-ish poet you read about in high school? Where she\u2019s young and rebellious? Starring Oscar nominee and pop star Hailee Steinfeld? Is this some Riverdale knockoff? Has TV\u2019s great horny-industrial complex claimed another victim?\n\nThe version of Emily Dickinson you see in Dickinson very much does fuck, but the show isn\u2019t really a teen soap. Instead, it\u2019s a bleak-as-hell 30-minute comedy about a moody poet who keeps rebelling against her parents. And it\u2019s a queer love story about Dickinson\u2019s relationship with her sister-in-law. And also, a gothic horror story about how she never actually did escape her own home. But creator Alena Smith doesn\u2019t mind if you refer to the show as \u201cSexy Dickinson.\u201d \u201cWhy do we think of her as this sexless shut-in?\u201d Smith said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to watch a show not about sexy Dickinson.\u201d\n\nIn Dickinson\u2019s first three episodes, Emily takes a carriage ride with Death (who happens to be played by Wiz Khalifa), cross-dresses to sneak into an all-male Amherst College lecture about volcanoes, and stages a house party where everyone takes opium and twerks. She wears impeccable period costumes, but sits like she\u2019s lounging on a couch for a TV binge, and she talks like someone who has high-speed internet and lives on a healthy diet of memes. If Emily Dickinson were alive today, Steinfeld joked, \u201cHer Twitter would be popping.\u201d\n\nThis is obviously not a historically accurate depiction of Emily Dickinson\u2019s life and times, but to Smith, it\u2019s spiritually accurate in its way. The show draws inspiration from the enigma of Dickinson\u2019s poetry, building off the scarce known facts about her life. \u201cEveryone\u2019s free to invent their own Emily Dickinson, and this is mine,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t in any way say it\u2019s the authoritative version.\u201d\n\nThe goal, essentially, is to blur the 1850s and the present day, making the argument that Dickinson \u2014 whose work is sexy, irreverent, queer, and much more challenging than you might remember from high school \u2014 is best understood as a contemporary millennial. Dickinson\u2019s historical circumstances are generally accurate, but the episodes are all set to a contemporary soundtrack that samples everything from Billie Eilish to Mitski. \u201cThe whole intention of the show is to make us lose track of the difference between the present and the past,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPhoto: Apple TV+\n\nSmith, who graduated from Yale drama school in 2006 and had a career as a playwright in New York before writing on shows like The Affair and The Newsroom, first started working on the idea that became Dickinson in 2013. \u201cI had this bizarre idea to make an experimental half-hour show about Emily Dickinson,\u201d she said. Smith had grown up in the Hudson Valley and gotten interested in Dickinson as a writer in her early 20s, feeling a kinship with the way she felt \u201ctrapped and misunderstood the way a lot of young artists do\u201d and becoming drawn to the poet\u2019s \u201cmorbid wit.\u201d\n\nIn writing the show, Smith decided that Dickinson\u2019s life fit well into the format of \u201cbleak, ironic\u201d comedy: She lived with her family in 19th-century New England, never married, rarely traveled, and became increasingly reclusive in her later years. Most of her work went unpublished until after her death in 1866. As Smith saw it, the status quo that governs a sitcom is also a sort of gothic horror story to live through. No matter what happens, at the end of the day, Emily always has to return home to the same house and the same family. \u201cOn the outside, her life has maybe the structure of the British Office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut inside, it\u2019s a lot more than that.\u201d\n\nFrom that idea, Smith got interested in the eerie parallels between 1850s America and today, especially the sense of living within a fractured political system with a fear of an apocalyptic end, whether from war or climate change. \u201cIn the same way that we look around and feel like everything is changing so fast under our feet, they were on the brink of Civil War,\u201d she said. \u201cMany ideals that the country had only been recently built upon were proven to be deceptive or untenable.\u201d On the show, Dickinson\u2019s Whig-affiliated politician father Edward (Toby Huss) insists that he\u2019s against slavery, but wouldn\u2019t be so radical as to call himself an abolitionist, in a dig against the oblivious centrist politicians of today. \u201cMaybe we still have Whigs in this country and we don\u2019t know it,\u201d Smith joked.\n\nIn researching the show, Smith read \u201cevery biography of Dickinson that there is,\u201d including scholarly analyses of her poems (one Dickinson scholar, Alexandra Socarides, is a family friend), and also consulted with Civil War historians. She avoided seeing either of the two recent Dickinson movies, 2017\u2019s A Quiet Passion and 2019\u2019s Wild Nights With Emily, however, because they came out while she was working on the show and she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get screwed up by watching them.\u201d\n\nShe also, of course, read Dickinson\u2019s poems, which form the backbone of the show, giving a structure and a title to each episode. \u201cIt\u2019s not that in each episode she writes a poem, but each episode uses one of her poems in order to explore a given theme,\u201d Smith said. \u201cShe wrote so many great poems that are so evocative and imaginatively exciting that they\u2019re sort of an inexhaustible resource.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Apple TV+\n\nFrom 2013 on, Smith developed the project \u201ckind of in secret,\u201d working on a pilot script on spec, then taking it to producers Michael Sugar and Ashley Zalta at Sugar23 a few years into the process. In 2017, they brought the show to Apple, to whom they\u2019d promised a first look, and the tech company bought it after hearing Smith\u2019s pitch for the first three seasons. (According to the Hollywood Reporter, Dickinson is currently in production on season two, though Smith told Vulture she couldn\u2019t discuss future seasons.) \u201cThis was a very, very thoroughly thought-out project, because it had had so much work,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut ultimately, it was one pitch.\u201d She pitched the show on a Friday, and Apple bought it on Monday.\n\nFor the concept to work, Dickinson needed a great Dickinson, and Hailee Steinfeld was the first person they went to with a script. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s American was really important,\u201d Smith said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want a Brit because I think our typical idea of period is always a Brit. And Emily Dickinson is an American poet. And there\u2019s also something about Hailee that is just so contemporary.\u201d Steinfeld said that she decided to sign onto the series, which she also executive produces, after in-depth conversations with Smith: \u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play this character who would stop at nothing to do whatever made her feel creatively alive as an artist.\u201d\n\nThe show focuses on Emily\u2019s immediate family, including her father Edward (Toby Huss), her mother Emily Norcross Dickinson (Jane Krakowski, obsessively cleaning or cooking in nearly every scene), her brother Austin (Adrian Blake Enscoe), her sister Lavinia (Anna Baryshnikov), and her friend, love interest, and future sister-in-law Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt). There\u2019s a significant amount of historical evidence that Sue and Emily had a sexual and/or romantic attachment, which was also explored in last spring\u2019s Wild Nights With Emily, and their relationship is a key part of the show. \u201cIn all my research of Dickinson, that is the core romantic relationship of her life, however you want to define it,\u201d Smith said, pointing out that people in Dickinson\u2019s era likely wouldn\u2019t have thought or acted in terms of the categories we use to define sexuality today, and defined her lead character\u2019s sexuality as \u201cfluid or queer.\u201d \u201cSue is not her only romantic interest in the show, but I think Sue is Emily\u2019s core soulmate,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAt least that\u2019s what Emily was so desperate for Sue to be.\u201d\n\nAmong Emily\u2019s other romantic interests: The literal embodiment of death, played by Wiz Khalifa, and who appears in several episodes over the course of the season. \u201cEmily, at least in the beginning of the show, glamorizes death,\u201d Smith said, so she wanted to cast \u201cthe coolest guy\u201d she could think of to play him. \u201cPart of her coming-of-age story over the course of the season is coming into a more mature relationship with death when she actually loses someone who is important to her.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a set of guest appearances, including John Mulaney as Henry David Thoreau (\u201cWe cancel him!\u201d Smith said with delight) and Zosia Mamet as Louisa May Alcott. Even the minor figures on the show are also based on real people; their names were borrowed from records about the Amherst railroad. \u201cPretty much every single character is named at least after a real person that was alive in Amherst at the time,\u201d Smith said.\n\nGiven that Dickinson takes place in rural Massachusetts in the 1850s, many of the historical figures that appear on it are white. Though the show takes liberties in other ways, Smith decided not to do colorblind casting because she wanted to talk about race \u201cauthentically.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean that the town of Amherst on the show is entirely white, however. \u201cA lot of our ideas about race in the 1850s we got through movies and books that were made in other times and that are more racist and more segregated than you would expect things to be,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you were in a lecture room in Amherst, you wouldn\u2019t see all white faces.\u201d Edward Jones, the first black student to graduate from Amherst, graduated in 1826, while Joseph Hardy Neesima, class of 1870, was the first Japanese student to graduate. Though Neesima may not have known Dickinson personally, a character based on him (played by Kevin Yee) does appear on the show. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pretend that one of the Dickinsons wasn\u2019t white because that would erase the truth,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut I was looking really hard for ways to find the characters who weren\u2019t and then show them.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Apple TV+\n\nTo underline the association between the present and the 19th century, Dickinson\u2019s soundtrack is full of modern needle drops \u2014 the more of-the-moment, the better. In essence, if Emily Dickinson were alive today, it feels like you\u2019re inside her iPhone (and it would be an iPhone, considering this is an Apple show). \u201cIf you used a song from the \u201980s or the \u201970s, the whole thing collapsed because all of a sudden you were introducing another temporal dimension, and we want this very strict binary between now and then,\u201d Smith said. She would write suggestions for songs into scripts, and then consult with other writers and producers to select what would end up on the show. Having the support of Apple Music helped, both in song selection and being able to license whatever they needed from Apple\u2019s library. An executive at Apple Music sent Smith \u201cbury a friend,\u201d the Billie Eilish track that appears in the pilot, before the song itself came out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who Billie Eilish was, and I listened to it and I was like, Holy shit, this sounds like it was written by Emily Dickinson,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was so long ago. I don\u2019t even know how fresh that is.\u201d\n\nTo Smith, including a wide selection of music from different artistic backgrounds also fit with the style of Dickinson\u2019s poetry. \u201cEmily Dickinson appropriated in her poetry. She appropriated the rhythms of her Irish maid. She appropriated the language of the Native Americans who came by the house to sell baskets,\u201d she said. \u201cAmerica has always been a melting pot. Even if you\u2019re an uptight New Englander, you\u2019re going to be affected by the language that\u2019s around you.\u201d\n\nWhile Dickinson sounds heady and conceptual, the series still looks like a period drama, with meticulously recreated interior sets shot at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn and exteriors shot at \u201cthis weird 19th-century period village\u201d at Old Bethpage Village on Long Island. At the encouragement of director David Gordon Green, who shot the pilot, the cast took etiquette and cooking classes. \u201cThey really did have us plucking real chickens and taking real innards out of things,\u201d Jane Krakowski said.\n\nSmith was careful to keep the characters\u2019 language and mannerisms period-accurate \u2014 at least up until the point where they rebel and sound like internet-age meme creators \u2014 but as she admits, there\u2019s no exact style guide to the show. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for details that uncannily resonate with where we are today,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could imagine someone in the 1850s having a bitch, please moment. That was probably an emotion that was available to them.\u201d", "description": "Alena Smith, creator of Apple TV+\u2019s Dickinson starring Hailee Steinfeld, explains the history behind the show. \u201cWhy do we think of her as this sexless shut-in?\u201d Smith said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to watch a show not about sexy Dickinson.\u201d", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/22/22-dickinson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
