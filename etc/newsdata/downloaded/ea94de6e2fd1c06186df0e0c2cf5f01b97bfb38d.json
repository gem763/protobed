It is currently running a campaign for Mr. Porter, the menswear brand of digital fashion retailer Net a Porter, targeted at men who follow New York and The Cut.\n\nIn some ways, the Instagram distribution strategy is another step down a well-trod path: Using social platforms to extend distribution for branded content publishers produces for advertisers.\n\nBut it also represents another step into territory where advertisers ask publishers to treat their most expensive ad formats as vehicles for performance. While New York\u2019s campaign with Mr. Porter does not include any kind of affiliate commerce relationship, the publisher hears more and more advertisers ask for one.\n\n\u201cThe line between affiliate and marketer is starting to break down,\u201d said David Spiegel, New York Media\u2019s head of sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some come to us with that ask. But I don\u2019t think the industry as a whole is ready to break down those silos.\u201d\n\nWhile many publishers have embraced Instagram as a platform for creating branded content, it has been far less useful as a channel for distributing branded or commerce content.\n\nBut over the past year, publishers and advertisers alike are both looking at Instagram as a place to drive commerce. Spiegel said that advertisers increasingly ask for branded content to appear there, part of a broader trend of publishers and advertisers starting to take cues from one another on platforms.\n\n\u201cBrands tend to use Instagram to assert a lifestyle that\u2019s enabled by the products they produce whereas publishers tend to use Instagram to highlight content they\u2019re producing,\u201d said Apu Gupta, the founder of Curalate, a tool that helps drive referral traffic from Instagram. \u201cI do think these two groups are increasingly borrowing from each other. What\u2019s driving this is the increasing realization that product discovery is a lucrative opportunity. Stumbling upon something you never knew you needed in your life is a gratifying experience.\u201d\n\nDigiday Publishing Summit Europe Budapest, Hungary Buy Passes Subscribe for an exclusive, inside look at what\u2019s actually happening in the video industry delivered to your inbox weekly.

In the space of two years, New York has grown shopping recommendations from an idea into a 16-person vertical, The Strategist, that tripled its revenue over the past year. A standalone 35-person content studio, New York Stories, which formally announced this September, works on advertisers\u2019 branded content campaigns that typically command a six-figure price tag.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been a good publisher, especially on the higher end, trying to drive purchase consideration,\u201d Spiegel said.\n\nInstagram has been useful for driving both. The Strategist began allowing retailers to shop directly inside its Stories content last summer, and it has been using Instagram feed posts published across New York vertical accounts to drive traffic to its affiliate commerce posts. This kind of hybrid approach is more an experiment than a scaled, commonplace one, said Socialbakers CEO Yuval Ben-Itzhak.\n\nWhile advertisers have been asking New York for both feed and story placements, New York has found that story placements are actually more effective.\n\nRobert Glazer, the founder of affiliate agency Acceleration Partners, said that publishers would welcome the opportunity to start using Instagram ads more as an affiliate marketing channel.", "description": "", "authors": ["Max Willens", "Lucinda Southern", "Jessica Davies"], "top_image": "https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NYMag-Verticals.jpg"}
