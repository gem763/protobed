I use fresh whole shrimp, and it takes some time to remove the heads and shells. Buy larger shrimp, even though they are more expensive, because peeling smaller ones will take even longer.\n\nInstead of the usual white bread, I buy fried yau ja gwai, or Chinese dough sticks, because they're so deliciously crunchy when refried. Yau ja gwai are sold in pairs - you'll probably need one and a half pairs with this quantity of shrimp, to make about 24 shrimp toasts. You can buy the yau ja gwai from many congee shops and some Chinese bakeries.\n\nThese taste best freshly fried, but if you must cook them in advance, reheat them for about five minutes in an oven preheated to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F). The shrimp toast pairs well with champagne or cocktails, as a pre-dinner snack.", "description": "This is a luxurious version of a popular Cantonese snack.
