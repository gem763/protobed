(Picture: Philipp Lipiarski)\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s the future of museums,\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The main point is that it\u2019s not only about selfies, but also about having a good time, being able to interact while experiencing art.\n\n\u2018I do think that people spend a lot of time on their phones and that\u2019s why we try to combine that with something real and something fun. But I don\u2019t think it is our responsibility to educate them.\u2019\n\nUnlike its US counterpart, this Insta-friendly museum will not have a permanent space.\n\nThe pop-up opens today (4 October) and will be open for six months, with Petra and her co-founder Nils Peper planning to take it to other countries.\n\nFingers crossed that the UK is on the list.\n\nMORE: Financial security and buying property top the list of things people in their twenties worry about\n\nMORE: Adorable dog\u2019s face looks very human and people can\u2019t get enough\n\nMORE: The Yacht Week is hiring two people to travel the world for the \u2018best job ever\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "People will be able to pose in ball pits and against floral walls, with popular social media influencers very keen to visit.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88339803_1570186802.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
