Others were caught under their homes when winds turned the structures into splinters, leaving the cowering residents exposed, he said.\n\nThe huge debris piles left by the storm are challenging for search and recovery teams, which cannot use bulldozers or other heavy equipment to search for the dead. That makes recovery and identification a slow process.\n\nThe Bahamas government has announced a telephone hotline where Bahamians can call to report family members who have been missing since the storm.\n\nAt least five deaths have been blamed on the storm in the southeastern United States and one in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Rocky Creek, a settlement of a few families on the east end of battered Grand Bahama island, members of the Reckley family picked through what remained of nearly a dozen homes that had been inhabited by their extended family.\n\nThe Reckleys and their assorted spouses, children and in-laws lived off the income from three boats they use for fishing and for providing tourist excursions from a pristine beachfront facing the turquoise Caribbean.\n\nThe family rode out the storm in nearby government shelters, and returned to find their smashed homes.\n\nThe motors of the Reckleys' boats were also destroyed. The entire extended family together earned about $800 a month, not enough to buy insurance, said Synobia Reckley, 25, who traveled from the island's main city, Freeport, to help her family.\n\n\"It hurt. This is all I know,\" Reckley said. \"We lost a lot of old pictures. ... We don't have nothing to look back on. It's just heartbreaking.\"\n\nThe only aid they have received so far is from foreign aid groups and U.S. firefighters, said Reckley's husband, Dexter Edwards, a heavy equipment operator.\n\n\"Right now, ain't much joy. You just gotta try to keep your head up,\" Edwards said. \"There's always a future. Only thing we can do right now is rebuild \u2014 rebuild and try to move forward.\"", "description": "U.S. emergency workers on Monday found five bodies in the debris left by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, and they said they expected to find more victims a week after the devastating storm hit.
