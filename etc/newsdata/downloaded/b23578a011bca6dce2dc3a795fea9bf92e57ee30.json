Demonstrations include clogging roads and blocking bridges with their bodies and other big objects.\n\nHundreds of protesters have been arrested for causing traffic disruptions, but organizers say they will continue to come out in force for the next two weeks.\n\nMorgan asked Extinction Rebellion\u2019s co-leader Skeena Rathor how she arrived to their studio. Rathor said a car sent by the station had picked her up.\n\nWhen Morgan then asked her if she had a T.V. at her home and if her children use computers, Rathor said she did not think it was relevant to \"the planet emergency.\"\n\n\u201cDo you see the problem with all this? You go on about \u2018My kids can\u2019t get out of bed because they\u2019re all so terrified,\u2019 I\u2019m not surprised they're terrified because your mum\u2019s telling them everyday the planet\u2019s about to end, and yet, I bet your own carbon footprint, for all the stuff I\u2019ve just mentioned is terrible,\" Morgan said.\n\n\"So why don't you give your computer, give up your television, give up your air conditioning, walk your kids to school, get a bike to the studio. Why don't you practice what you preach?\" he added.\n\nRathor said the problem is not about individual carbon footprints, but it is a \"system-wide issue\" and said she would not be able to \"raise the alarm\" about the issue if she did not participate in the system.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/10/2019 14:20:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/283/87f0b0cf-e4bf-411a-b68e-996cdd2e0353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
