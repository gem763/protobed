Here's how the ultra-wealthy prepare for the worst.", "language": "en", "text": "On Wednesday night, Hurricane Dorian\u2014 which has left at least 20 people dead in the Bahamas, at last count \u2014 was once again upgraded to a Category 3 storm, Business Insider previously reported. People living along the east coast of the US face dangerous storm surges, rain, winds, and even tornadoes.\n\nWhile preventing loss of life is the priority for public officials and relief workers, many homeowners worry about the possibility of damage to their property \u2014 or, worse, total destruction. Homeowners' insurance generally covers basic weather-related issues, but for those who own higher-value property (and other assets, like yachts or fine art), financial losses can be massive.\n\nThere are marked differences between how affluent homeowners and the \"average\" homeowner handle oncoming storms when they live in hurricane-prone areas.\n\nRead more: After missing much of Florida, Hurricane Dorian is heading north with 105 mph winds, and could reach Georgia by tonight\n\nAccording to experts, the differences are two-fold:\n\nLuxury homeowners opt for a higher level of insurance coverage \u2014 complete with added options to protect their watercraft and pricey personal collections \u2014 to better deal with potential damage.\n\nHigh net worth individuals take precautions by adding \"hurricane-proofing\" features (or custom-building homes with that in mind) to head off potential damage.\n\nGiven that many of the most in-demand areas for luxury homes are coastal \u2014 and often in hurricane-prone areas, including Florida cities like Key West and Miami\u2014 the likelihood of a storm touching down near an affluent homeowner's property is pretty high. Here's how the ultra-wealthy prepare for hurricanes.\n\nThe ultra-wealthy buy (and build) \"resilient\" homes.\n\nIn October 2018, when Hurricane Michael touched down in Mexico Beach, Florida, only one of the oceanfront homes was left intact: Sand Palace, a two-story property that had been built only the year before. Most of the surrounding properties, which were older constructions built before more stringent building codes were enacted in 2007, were decimated in the wake of the Category 4 storm.\n\nThis was no stroke of luck \u2014 the homeowners, attorney Russell King and his nephew, Dr. Lebron Lackey \u2014 specifically built their \"dream home\" to withstand \"the big one,\" they told the New York Times shortly after the storm hit.\n\nAn aerial shot of the damage from Hurricane Michael seen in Mexico Beach, Florida, on October 11, 2018. SevereStudios.com via AP\n\nKing and Dr. Lackey declined to tell The New York Times how much they'd spent to hurricane-proof their home, but their architect, Charles A. Gaskin, did tell the Times that \"building a house the way they did roughly doubles the cost per square foot, compared with ordinary building practices.\"\n\nGeoff Chick, an architect building hurricane-resistant homes in the Gulf of Mexico, told Business Insider in 2018 that building a hurricane-resistant property comes down to a select few foundational features and accessories. Impact windows, for example, are designed to withstand the impact of a 2x4 stud heading toward them at 150 miles per hour \u2014 but they're about double the cost of a normal window package ($40,000 compared to the standard $18,000).\n\nRead more: How to hurricane-proof your home, according to an architect who designs homes that could withstand Category 4 hurricanes\n\nSpeaking again more recently with Business Insider, Chick said that, if a home is custom-built with hurricane-resistant features in mind, there's not much the homeowners need to do before the storm hits \u2014 other than maybe bringing unsecured patio furniture inside.\n\n\"Most of my [clients] leave town and enjoy a vacation until the power is back on and the coast is clear,\" he said, adding that one Albany, Georgia, family he designed a beach house for actually moved to that coastal home for two weeks when their inland Albany property's power was knocked out by Hurricane Michael last year.\n\nFor many wealthy homeowners, the extra costs are a small price to pay for the peace of mind knowing their investment is better protected.\n\n\"While the Florida building code has done a great job of increasing the design and construction standards in Florida to protect residents from hurricanes and other natural disasters, the luxury buyer has a unique perspective on what is important to them, and [they] are willing (and able) to pay for it,\" Ryan Homan, the Director of Finance of privately-owned real estate investment and management firm Blue Jay Capital, told Business Insider.\n\nBlue Jay Capital built 121 Marina, a development at elite Ocean Reef, a private club community in Key Largo, Florida. In addition to the \"standard\" luxury amenities, the 27-unit condominium building was designed with a number of hurricane-proofing features, including:\n\nA 2,400-gallon back-up generator that can keep the building fully functional for 10 days (\"Very important, as it allows the AC to run and protect the significant interior investment in finishes, furniture, and art from being damaged by humidity if the power is knocked out for several days after the storm,\" Homan explained);\n\nFour pumps at garage level capable of pumping 20,000 gallons of water per hour, in the event of flooding;\n\nA seawall raised to 5.2 feet elevation (a foot higher than the Ocean Reef Marina seawall);\n\nSliding glass doors that can resist 174 mph winds (above the building code's mandated resistance of 150 mph);\n\nAnd flood panels to protect against flooding and water damage that can be installed as quickly as one day in advance of a hurricane warning.\n\nAn exterior shot of 121 Marina, a luxury condominium building developed by Blue Jay Capital. Blue Jay Capital\n\nThere isn't a \"standard\" cost of hurricane-proofing a luxury home, according to Homan: \"It really depends on the specific project, location, amenities, and number of units. I would say we spend several hundred thousand dollars per unit \u2014 [121 Marina has a] total of 27 units \u2014 to add additional hurricane-resistant features.\"\n\nBuying into a newly built hurricane-proof luxury building is relatively more affordable than building a resilient single-family home.\n\n\"We can spread costs of these features across 27 homeowners that have all bought $5 million+ units,\" Homan added.\n\nResidents at 121 Marina also received a \"Hurricane Dorian Preparedness Report\" ahead of the current storm, detailing what precautionary measures were taken to secure the property. \"So owners can have peace of mind wherever they are in the world,\" Homan explained.\n\nWealthy homeowners opt for private client insurance.\n\nWhen you own a multimillion-dollar property on the coast, your home's insurance policy won't look much like, say, the policy for an inland home of average value.\n\nJon Kelly, the CEO of high net worth insurance broker Kelly Klee, told Business Insider that there are two main differences between private client insurers and ordinary home insurance companies: actual policy terms and how the insurers treat clients once a claim is filed.\n\nThe policy terms, in short, are more generous with a higher (and therefore pricier premium) level of coverage.\n\nUnlike standard insurers, who often try to find ways to deny a claim based on the existing policy, private client insurers tend to \"really look at the policy to find a way to say yes\" and to ensure high customer satisfaction, Kelly told Business Insider. While mass-market insurers generally limit what they'll pay out towards rebuilding a property after a total loss, high-end carriers are more accommodating of the client's wants and needs.\n\nAnd if the homeowner chooses not to rebuild in the same spot, the carriers will work with them to help make that happen as well.\n\n\"Private client policies often allow for the policyholder to opt out of rebuilding and take a cash settlement to rebuild elsewhere \u2014 also a big benefit in devastated areas that might be the site of painful memories,\" Kelly added.\n\nBut it's not just homes the ultra-wealthy have to worry about insuring \u2014 it's also their cars, yachts, and art and wine collections.\n\nYachts are at obvious risk of damage during hurricane weather. Mark Thompson/Getty Images\n\nMegan Gorman, a managing partner at Florida-based, boutique high net worth tax and financial planning firm Chequers Financial Management, told Business Insider that high end carriers \u2014 including Chubb, PURE, and AIG \u2014 offer the appropriate level of coverage for affluent homeowners. Their coverage often includes a number of services that go above and beyond the \"usual\" homeowners' insurance benefits.\n\n\"Some [high net worth individuals] work with services that help remove these assets in a disaster,\" Gorman added.\n\nSimilarly, Los Angeles Magazine's Bob Morris reported in April that AIG Private Client Group hires an America's Cup sailor (among the best of the best in the sport of sailing yachts) to find safe storage for luxury watercraft before a storm hits. The costs the company incurs to do so is well worth it: Repairing or replacing damaged luxury items and assets would cost an astronomical amount more.\n\n\"As a business model, protecting everything from pianos and antiques to wine collections before a disaster arrives is cheaper for insurers than the billions they would have to spend rebuilding and replacing properties,\" Morris wrote.\n\nKelly told Business Insider that private client insurance carriers offer far broader coverage for high-value assets within and around the home.\n\n\"For luxury vehicles, they offer 'agreed value' coverage that pays out based on a specific value rather than a lower depreciated amount,\" he explained. \"Thus, if one's $298,000 Ferrari is totaled due to flood, the owner knows she doesn't have to wonder how much she'll receive to replace the car, as it is written into the contract.\"\n\nFine art and other collections often have similarly client-friendly terms of coverage.\n\nAn extensive wine collection in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, mansion. Douglas Elliman\n\n\"With wine, for instance, our carriers offer coverage for 'sets' where one wine bottle in a set is destroyed and the value of the remaining bottles is lowered,\" Kelly told Business Insider. \"And when a storm is on the way, many times our carriers will help facilitate the packing, evacuation, and storage of high value collections (art, wine and spirits, collector cars, etc.) if needed to prevent losses.\"\n\nPrivate client insurance can also cover the costs of temporary housing for the displaced.\n\nAccording to Los Angeles Magazine's report, homeowners in the Hamptons fled to \"luxe hotels\" when Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012 \u2014 and billed their insurance carriers for the \"lengthy stays.\"\n\nSimilarly, Kelly told Business Insider that, should local authorities order an evacuation, the private client carriers his company works with typically \"provide coverage for 'reasonable expenses' required for homeowners to maintain their normal standard of living for 30 days if there is no damage to the home\" \u2014 and even longer if there is damage.\n\n\"If there is damage to the home, they generally don't put a time limit on this coverage while a damaged home is being repaired, and instead, offer coverage for the reasonable amount of time required to repair the loss and/or make the home properly inhabitable,\" Kelly added.\n\nWith private client insurance, it comes down to one basic, oft-repeated tenet: You really do get what you pay for. And if you're paying millions for a luxury home (and the luxury goods inside it), you're not likely to scoff at the lofty premiums to protect that investment.", "description": "Affluent homeowners' storm prepping differs in two ways: a higher level of insurance coverage and more money spent on hurricane-proofing features.", "authors": ["Caralynn Lippo"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7143482e22af6a182e3457-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
