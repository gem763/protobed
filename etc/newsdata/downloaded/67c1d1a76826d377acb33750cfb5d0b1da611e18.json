Newly issued IPOs\u2014Uber, Lyft and Slack\u2014are losing values at breathtaking rates, while others in the on-desk circle, such as the once widely anticipated We, are headed back to the bench.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s new form of capitalism had seemed to promise insiders enormous gains even as companies lost money. Now the unicorns are crashing on the rocks of reality. \u201cHot\u201d companies such as Peloton Interactive, Uber and Lyft may have grown enormously but they did so largely on the backs also of enormous losses; enthusiasm for newer IPOs has dimmed as investors discover, once again, that results finally matter more than hype.\n\nPeople at venture capital firms, notably Japan\u2019s SoftBank, and its $100 billion investment fund, won\u2019t be missing meals, but likely won\u2019t be adding zeros to their net worth either. Analysts generally see a downturn and some predict another searing crash, with the potential for \u201cmassive losses\u201d like those associated with the busting of the dotcom bubble in 2000. There are certainly parallels: 81 percent of companies with IPOs in 2000 failed to turn a profit in 2001. Out of 160 firms that went public in 2017, more than 60 percent failed to turn a profit in 2018.", "description": "Big tech grows up, gets treated with overdue suspicion, and aims to get boring.", "authors": ["Joel Kotkin"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571534165/191020-kotkin-tech-unicorns-hero_abajch", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
