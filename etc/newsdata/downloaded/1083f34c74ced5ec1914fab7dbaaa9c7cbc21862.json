The result is an ineffective \u2014 and often destructive \u2014 management style.\n\nScott is a former Google and Apple exec and CEO coach who now runs her own company, Radical Candor. The company provides software and training to organizations to help create better bosses.\n\nShe published a book in March 2017 by the same name, in which she offers readers practical management lessons drawn from her own experience.\n\n\"Radical candor\" is the most effective of four leadership styles that Scott outlines in the book. Each leadership style, she writes, is a behavior and not a trait \u2014 meaning it can be developed. So if you're currently a mediocre or even a bad boss, you can work on that.\n\nKim Scott's leadership framework. Kim Malone Scott\n\nScott visited the Business Insider office in March 2017 and walked us through the framework she developed to talk about different leadership styles. (You can see that image on the right.)\n\nThe graph has two axes: Care Personally and Challenge Directly.\n\nIf you tend to challenge directly, but don't care personally (i.e. if you follow the \"be professional\" advice), Scott calls your leadership style obnoxious aggression.\n\nIn the book, Scott writes:\n\n\"When bosses belittle employees, embarrass them publicly, or freeze them out, their behavior falls into this quadrant.\n\n\"This Obnoxious Aggression sometimes gets great results short-term but leaves a trail of dead bodies in its wake in the long run. Think about the Anna Wintour-inspired character played by Meryl Streep in 'The Devil Wears Prada.'\"\n\nNext up is ruinous empathy, characterized by caring personally but not challenging directly (i.e. following the \"don't say anything mean\" advice). Scott told Business Insider that this is the most common mistake that managers \u2014 and human beings in all relationships \u2014 make.\n\n\"Because you care, you fail to challenge directly because you don't want hurt somebody's feelings,\" Scott told us. \"You make a terrible mistake when you don't give somebody a heads-up when they're screwing up.\"\n\n\"We all screw up. It's actually an act of kindness to tell somebody when they're screwing up. It's not mean, and yet we often feel mean.\"\n\nThe worst place to be is the manipulative insincerity square, characterized by neither caring personally nor challenging directly.\n\nIn the book, Scott writes:\n\n\"People give praise and criticism that is manipulatively insincere when they are too focused on being liked or think they can gain some sort of political advantage by being fake \u2014 or when they are just too tired to care or argue any more.\"\n\nFinally, the ideal leadership style is radical candor. It's when you care personally and challenge directly. It sounds simple, Scott said, but it's rare in today's workplace.\n\nYou can start displaying radical candor by getting and giving concrete feedback\n\nYou can start displaying radical candor by getting feedback from your team \u2014 and then giving it.\n\nScott avoids the \"feedback sandwich\" \u2014 in which you praise, then criticize, and then praise again \u2014 but she says it's generally a good idea to offer more praise than criticism.\n\nShe writes:\n\n\"Be humble, helpful, offer guidance in person and immediately, praise in public, criticize in private, and don't personalize.\n\n\"Make it clear that the problem is not due to some unfixable personality flaw. Share stories when you've been criticized for something similar.\"\n\nAgain, these four management styles aren't fixed traits. \"The right way to use this framework is to judge conversations and to make sure you're moving in the right direction,\" Scott told Business Insider.\n\nAbove all, this framework makes it easier to evaluate your performance as a boss. Instead of wondering whether you've been encouraging or discouraging, motivating or de-motivating lately, you can measure yourself against the two dimensions.\n\nAs Scott said, you can \"name what happens when you fail with really clear language.\"", "description": "Kim Scott, author of \"Radical Candor,\" explains that being a good boss is about caring personally and challenging directly.", "authors": ["Shana Lebowitz", "Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cd7782e22af026714de13?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
