You share , I share. It\u2019s great isn\u2019t it Mum - @kerrykatona7 \".\n\nThis suggests the video was payback to her former pop star mother for all the embarrassing footage of her daughter she has shared over the years.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nKerry clearly didn't mind as she reposted the video to her own account, where she has 523,000 followers.\n\n\"So this is what my molly @123_mollymc posted this morning in her page!! Pay back!!\", she wrote.\n\nMolly has now moved in with her dad Brian McFadden's parents in Ireland so she can focus on her upcoming GCSE's without sharing the house with her four younger siblings.\n\nBrian told The Sun: \"[She's doing] good. It's very different for her. She's so used to being in a house with five kids.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"But studying for her finals, it's important that she can get a bit of peace and quiet and she gets spoilt rotten by my parents as well, so she's loving it.\"\n\nMeanwhile Kerry recently broke down on Loose Women when she admitted she felt guilty about her ex George Kay's death from drug overdose.\n\nKerry explained George hadn't seen his daughter for a year, a decision that has left her feeling \"guilty\" despite knowing it was \"for the best\" for her five-year-old daughter DJ.\n\n(Image: FameFlynet)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe explained: \"Yes I feel guilty. DJ didn\u2019t get to see her dad for a year of course I do, but every time I handed her over to George I'd fear I wasn\u2019t gonna get her back.\n\n\"George would spit in my face and then DJ started to spit in my face and I knew I was doing the best thing for DJ, I will stand by that decision but of course I felt guilty.\"\n\nAs she was asked about the death, not having spoken about it since, she began to cry while she confessed this was because of her \"anger\" over him leaving his daughter behind.", "description": "Kerry's teenage daughter shared a video of her makeup free mum laughing in her dressing down calling herself a \"k**b head\"", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Instagram", "Fameflynet", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20720571.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_kerry-katona.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
