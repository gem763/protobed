They won the case by not losing\u2014by counterattacking, raising phony charges, admitting no wrong. Trump paid careful attention. \u201cRoy would always be for an offensive strategy,\u201d Stone says in the film. \u201cThese were the rules of war. You don\u2019t fight on the other guy\u2019s ground; you define what the debate is going to be about. I think Trump would learn that from Roy. I learned that from Roy.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: Donald Trump\u2019s mafia mind-set\n\nIn 1953, Harry Truman described McCarthyism as \u201cthe corruption of truth, the abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play. It is the abandonment of due process of law. It is the use of the big lie and the unbounded accusation against any citizen in the name of Americanism and security. It is the rise to power of the demagogue who lives on untruth. It is the spread of fear and the destruction of faith in every level of our society.\u201d But even this accurate list of brutal tactics and crushing effects doesn\u2019t quite convey the malevolent quality that hovers over the story of Roy Cohn.\n\nCohn and Trump embody the Mafia style in American politics. I don\u2019t mean the Sopranos; I mean the cold will to power that carries a threat of murder without shame. (Cohn was accused of being responsible for the death by fire of a crewman on his yacht in an insurance plot; like so many other charges, this one was never pinned on him.) There\u2019s a soft spot in American life for this type. He\u2019s admired in mob movies, in war movies (George C. Scott as General George S. Patton: \u201cAmericans have never lost and will never lose a war, because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans\u201d), in sports (Al Davis, the owner of the Oakland Raiders: \u201cJust win, baby\u201d), in entertainment (Jay-Z: \u201cI never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti / That\u2019s right, it\u2019s wicked, that\u2019s life, I live it / Ain\u2019t asking for forgiveness for my sins\u201d).Two people interviewed in Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn? describe Cohn with the word \u201cevil.\u201d The film shows the Mafia style as it recurs in modern American politics\u2014a kind of metaphysical spirit that inhabits different characters at different times, always identifiable by the dead eyes.\n\nWhenever the Mafia style seems about to die, it turns out to be unkillable. McCarthy met his fate in 1954, when he took on the United States Army in hearings watched by 20 million Americans. The public was new to television and hadn\u2019t seen the Republican senator\u2019s tactics before\u2014the bullying, the lies and smears. When McCarthy went after a young lawyer who\u2019d been on the staff of the Army counsel, he didn\u2019t see the trap that was about to spring. Joseph Welch, the Army\u2019s special counsel, who had hired the young lawyer and was distressed to hear him needlessly maligned, interrupted: \u201cUntil this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or recklessness.\u201d Cohn saw the danger; he shook his head and motioned for McCarthy to stop, but McCarthy kept pressing, until Welch finally said, \u201cLet us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. You\u2019ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?\u201d", "description": "Roy Cohn connects the McCarthy era to the age of Trump across more than half a century.", "authors": ["George Packer", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_578551334/facebook.jpg?1570049539"}
