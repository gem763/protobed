These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination,\" she wrote from the handle @BerniceKing.\n\nKing died of an assassin's bullet in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968.\n\nZuckerberg argued that his company should give voice to minority views and said that court protection for free speech stemmed in part from a case involving a partially inaccurate advertisement by King supporters.
