Violent arrests of protesters have drawn international attention.\n\nOn Friday night hundreds of demonstrators, many masked and dressed in black, attacked MTR metro stations in the Mong Kok district, targeted because of televised scenes of police beating protesters on a metro train on Aug. 31 as they cowered on the floor.\n\nActivists, angry that the MTR closed stations to stop protesters from gathering and demanding CCTV footage of the beatings, tore down signs, broke turnstiles, set fires on the street and drew graffiti on walls.\n\nProtesters gathered again after nightfall on Saturday to be dispersed by tear gas followed by running clashes with police.\n\nThere were shouting matches in the afternoon outside the airport between police and people who wanted to pick up arriving family members but were told to go away.\n\nProtesters are seen near a fire close by Mong Kok police station in Hong Kong, China September 7, 2019.

She said Beijing backed her \u201call the way\u201d.\n\nThe bill would have allowed extraditions of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. In contrast, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations, which began in June, have long since broadened into calls for more democracy and many protesters have pledged to fight on.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
