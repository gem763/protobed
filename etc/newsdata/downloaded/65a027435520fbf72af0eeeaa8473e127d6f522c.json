My TV soap is going well and I have a good feeling about my film,\" said Kong.\n\nKong has a charm that makes her come across as a girl next door one can open up to, and this enables viewers to easily empathize with her characters.\n\nThe same is true for \"Crazy Romance,\" which portrays a break-up and new relationship between a typical young couple of today.\n\nKong says romantic comedies are never easy for her despite her reputation and impressive portfolio in the genre. \"I get stressed and a lot of things run through my mind each time,\" she said. One of her biggest fears is repeating her previous roles. \"If something seems familiar, I often ask the director or writer to make a change. Some may call me fussy, but I believe that is what brought me to where I am now,\" she said.\n\n\"I especially like playing characters with high self-esteem, who are as committed to their work as they are devoted to love, because that kind of person, be it a woman or a man, seems awesome,\" she said.", "description": "Kong Hyo-jin Proves She Is Rom-Com Magnet on Both Big and Small Screens", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/05/2019100500350_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
