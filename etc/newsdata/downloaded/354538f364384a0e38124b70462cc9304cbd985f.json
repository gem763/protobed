Over 10,000 structures, both residential and commercial, were located in the mandatory evacuation zones.\n\n\"This is a very dynamic fire that is moving in a westward direction,\" the LAFD said.\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES, STRONG WINDS PROMPT NEWSOM TO DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY; 200,000 ORDERED TO EVACUATE\n\nJames, one of the NBA's most prominent athletes, tweeted he had to evacuate from his home after the blaze erupted, calling the fires \"no joke.\"\n\n\"Had to emergency evacuate my house and I\u2019ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms,\" he said, later sharing they were able to find somewhere to accommodate them.\"I [pray emoji] for all the families in the area that could be affected by these [fire emojis] now!
