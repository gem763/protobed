As she named those 26 never-to-be-enacted bills engraved laboriously on goatskin vellum, they might as well have been scribbled in ballpoint pen, these electioneering geegaws and giveaways, embellished with thumbscrews on crime and migration. But nothing matters here except the evanescent promise of an EU withdrawal deal, always just beyond reach. \u201cMy government will \u2026\u201d she intoned as if sucking lemons, but she has no government capable of doing anything at all.\n\nWhat heavy lifting it would take to turn this country into Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cgreatest place on Earth\u201d, in its present miserable state caused mainly by him. Leave aside Brexit devilment that hangs by a thread, look at the rest of his empty prospectus. If this was a hunting expedition designed to shoot Labour\u2019s fox, it may have the opposite effect.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies says his spending plans match those in Labour\u2019s last manifesto\n\nBlack Rod summoned the Commons to hear the end of austerity, but that\u2019s almost as much sham humbuggery as all the rest. There is indeed to be spending, enough to set both the last Tory chancellors gnashing their teeth at the loss of their ill-gotten austerity savings. But come an election, mere announcements of a bit of easing up won\u2019t expunge the bitter era of cuts that will scar the public service landscape for years to come. Bungs may ease the worst, preventing deeper cuts, but Johnson\u2019s \u201csacred\u201d NHS, schools and police are as stretched and stricken as ever, the jam promised for next year only thinly spread. And there\u2019s still the rawness of a million public sector jobs axed and 2,000 food banks serving those who lost working tax credits.\n\nBut here\u2019s the tripwire, Johnson\u2019s catch-22. He will only win if he has pulled off Brexit \u2013 but his version, Britain out of both customs union and single market, will drastically shrink his own Treasury receipts. His Brexit will push the economy into near-recession just as the world teeters towards a Trump trade war slowdown. Already his Brexit referendum victory has made us \u00a355bn poorer, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies says, pointing to three years of lost productivity on top of this decade of stagnant living standards. Johnson\u2019s Brexit will push his government back into austerity, so in his victory would be his own defeat.\n\nStrip away his florid bluster on the NHS and schools, and the reality for public services will be continued belt-tightening. Next year the NHS gets a slight breather: not the 40 new hospitals emblazoned across his favourable press, but just six, the repairs problem acute in mental and community health units. The 10,000 doctors and 40,000 nurses missing due to George Osborne\u2019s early cuts in training places will not be found: expect decades of shortages, as the Nuffield Trust says twice as many training places are needed.\n\nThe pain of the cuts was never fairly distributed, so watch these small easements go to better-off places. Take schools: the 5% increase next year is what Johnson calls a \u201clevelling up\u201d, taking from the schools with most to give to those with less funding. Sounds fair? Not when that means giving to well-heeled Tory shires while taking from deprived areas in greater need. Analysts find 83% of schools will still be worse off next year than in 2015, with \u00a3245 less for each primary pupil, and \u00a3304 for secondary pupils.\n\nNo Tory Queen\u2019s speech is complete unless it commands \u201cBoris blitz on crooks\u201d front pages the following day. True, Labour often did it, ratcheting up punishment for one day\u2019s headlines, each cheap gesture doubling the number of prison cells with inmates deprived of any means to prevent reoffending.\n\nPriti Patel\u2019s hostile-environment Home Office ends free movement and vows to round up every EU unfortunate who failed to apply for settled status, chasing away migrants that the economy desperately needs. It\u2019s easy to predict her \u201ccontrol with compassion\u201d watchword will cause more Windrush abominations, with lifelong inhabitants wrongly removed. Popular? No longer, as migration has dropped in public concerns.\n\nLittle surprise that there is no plan for social care \u2013 now \u201con its knees\u201d, warns the Nuffield Trust. But as Theresa May found, that\u2019s far too hot to handle; like climate change, which gets no mention as to how Johnson would ever get on track to reach net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nLittle in his menu is what it seems, none frames a vision or idea: just focus-grouped pleasers. For political skulduggery, a bill forcing voters to turn up with passport or driving licence will exclude the poor and the young, with 9 million not registered, since David Cameron stopped colleges automatically signing up their over-18s.\n\nJeremy Corbyn hits out at 'farcical' Queen's speech Read more\n\nShoot Labour\u2019s fox? More likely Johnson has shot himself in the foot. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says his spending plans match those in Labour\u2019s last manifesto, which were roundly condemned by May as unaffordable. With one bound, he has freed Labour from accusations of financial incontinence. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s manifesto will offer far more, appealing to those the Tories forget, particularly women, with free childcare, social care and tuition fees.\n\nThough the IFS may accuse both parties of busting their budgets, as it always adds, that isn\u2019t overspending if they raise taxes too. In this low-tax country that pays a lot less tax than it did, Labour will tax the rich and corporations, while Johnson gifts top earners a \u00a39bn cut.\n\n\u201cTired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change\u201d was Johnson\u2019s biting portrait of the country\u2019s mood; but who should voters blame for that? His Brexit is the cause, and if he pushes it through it will be his downfall, too.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The prime minister wanted to shoot Labour\u2019s fox but he has no vision, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644b3330eb174d6db47165aba87203df14fd603b/0_201_3869_2321/master/3869.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=61e38a6e5e7102d73b1d0b407d1d615b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
