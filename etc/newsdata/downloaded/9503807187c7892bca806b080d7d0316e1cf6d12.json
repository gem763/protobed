This was vengeance and it was not a serious mental illness,\u201d Harris County Assistant District Attorney Samantha Knecht said in court, adding that he was \u201cnot a disorganized, psychotic individual. That is a man with a plan.\u201d\n\nThroughout the month-long trial in Houston, prosecutors argued Haskell had been planning for months to drive from California to Texas to carry out the execution, motivated by his desire to hurt anyone who helped his ex-wife, Melannie Lyon, after their acrimonious divorce.\n\n\u201cHe absolutely knew what he was doing that day,\u201d Knecht said during her closing arguments Wednesday. \u201cHe took steps to hide, to disguise, and to plan this execution.\u201d\n\nHaskell\u2019s defense attorneys did not deny the 39-year-old committed the crime\u2014but argued that he was driven to kill by his mental-health problems and the voices in his head.\n\n\u201cHe had a severe mental illness,\u201d defense lawyer Douglas Durham said. \u201cDon\u2019t let yourselves get angry or become vengeful yourself for the terrible, terrible acts of Ronald Haskell.\u201d\n\nProsecutors argued against his insanity defense, pointing to Haskell\u2019s planning of the crime, including his purchase of a FedEx uniform to wear as a disguise to gain access to the Stay family\u2019s residence. Haskell also allegedly made a pit stop in Utah to steal a gun from his ex-girlfriend, and then purchased over 200 rounds of ammo.\n\nHaskell stalked the Stay home for days, prosecutors said, before finally knocking on the door dressed in his FedEx outfit on July 9, 2014. Cassidy Stay, who was then 15, testified in court that she opened the door and told Haskell her parents were not home but she expected them to return in an hour.\n\n\u201cHe puts on this FedEx shirt, this disguise. If he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was wrong, why did he need a disguise?\u201d Knecht said.\n\nThe 39-year-old left but later returned and forced himself inside the house. Cassidy Stay testified that she was tied up and held at gunpoint with her siblings until her parents arrived.\n\n\u201cI felt like the light got sucked out. I started to get nervous,\u201d Stay told jurors. \u201cI said please don\u2019t hurt us, please don\u2019t hurt us. I knew how dangerous he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went through and told him my brothers and sisters names and ages. I was appealing to his humanity. I didn\u2019t think someone would hurt kids if they knew how old they were,\u201d she added.\n\nThe teenager said they were all told to lie in a row, then Haskell began counting to seven before shooting them in the head. Katie Stay lunged at him, prosecutors said, when he shot her in the face with a makeshift silencer over his weapon.\n\n\u201cI saw her fall. I started screaming, I heard Zach screaming. I heard another shot and then Zach stopped screaming,\u201d Stay testified.\n\nStay said she played dead alongside her fatally shot father, Stephen Stay, her brothers Bryan, 13, and Zach, 4, and sisters, Emily, 9, and Rebecca, 7.\n\nWhen he\u2019d finished shooting, Haskell fled and Stay called police, telling them \u201cUncle Ronnie\u201d was heading to her grandparents\u2019 house. Several officers caught up with Haskell near Lyon\u2019s parents\u2019 home and arrested him after a standoff.\n\nMelannie Lyon, 38, told jurors that Haskell had often threatened to harm her and her family if she told anyone about his physical and emotional abuse\u2014and instantly knew it was her ex-husband when she heard her family members had been murdered.\n\n\u201cHe had carried through on his promises to make me watch my family die,\u201d Lyon said.\n\nThe mother of four spoke about the abuse she endured during her 12-year marriage to Haskell, who isolated her from her family and threatened to kill her if she left.\n\nIn 2008, Lyon said she finally reported her husband\u2019s abuse, at which point he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was granted nine months probation. Five years later, she said she reached a breaking point when her husband punched her during a fight about flooring for their new Utah home.\n\n\u201cThat was my wake up call,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cI knew I could not raise my kids in this evil environment any longer.\u201d\n\nWhen Haskell was at work, she took their kids and stayed at a shelter for five weeks while she filed for a protective order. Lyon said her sister Katie came up to help her leave Utah. At one point, Haskell allegedly threatened Katie during a conversation with his oldest son, saying, \u201cIf she\u2019s there helping you and helping your mom, I will make her pay.\u201d\n\nHaskell\u2019s defense attorneys said that while Lyon\u2019s decision to divorce him caused him to spiral, it was the voices in his head that urged him to kill the Stays so his marriage could be saved.\n\n\u201cHe tried to get help for years. He didn\u2019t want to be this way. He had no control,\u201d Neal Davis, another defense attorney, said.\n\nForensic psychiatrist Stephen Raffle testified that at the time of the killings, Haskell was suffering from a form of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, a condition characterized by hallucinations or delusions.\n\nRaffle said the voices in Haskell\u2019s head \u201chad basically taken control\u201d of him, adding that one \u201cvoice name Joseph was telling Ron that he has to kill members of his ex-wife\u2019s Melannie\u2019s family in order to get reunited with her.\u201d\n\nLyon dismissed those claims, stating that during their marriage, her ex-husband had been diagnosed with depression and that he had abused his medication.\n\n\u201cHe used his health in any state as kind of a feather in his cap as an excuse for his behavior,\u201d she said, adding that he never spoke about delusions or hallucinations.", "description": "Ronald Lee Haskell was found guilty of murdering his ex-wife\u2019s sister and her husband, as well as four of their children in 2014.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_20/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569526152/RTR3Y7CG_phayxq", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
