MPs will vote on the second reading of the legislation on Tuesday, after which amendments can be proposed \u2014 a process that will potentially give opponents the opportunity to alter the deal.\n\nKeir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said his party plans to push for changes to the deal including a contentious change to customs arrangements, and pushing for the deal to be put before the public in a second referendum.\n\nAbout one million protesters swarmed central London Saturday calling for a second referendum on Brexit. Organizers said the turnout was comparable to a People\u2019s Vote rally held six months earlier.\n\nBercow\u2019s decision sparked anger among government MPs, who accused him of pro-Remainer bias.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker has yet again denied us a chance to deliver on the will of the British people,\u201d said Johnson through a spokesman.\n\nConservative MP David Davies was also critical of Bercow. \u201cThe only consistency one can find in your rulings is that they always seem to favor one side of the argument and never the government,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Bercow dismissed the criticism, saying government ministers were only \u201cgrumbling\u201d because his ruling had gone against them.\n\n\u201cThe consistent thread is I try to do what I think is right by the House of Commons,\u201d he said.\n\nCover: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street, to go to the Houses of Parliament in London, Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019.
