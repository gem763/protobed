Traor\u00e9\u2019s first, in particular, was all of this in microcosm. A City foray broke down and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez made a mug of Otamendi then found the Spaniard, who showed plenty of composure with his finish. For his second, Traor\u00e9 was put through by Jim\u00e9nez once more and again made no mistake.\n\nThe rhythm that signifies City are in their hypnotic groove never looked close to being established. Instead, what unfolded was a disrupted display.\n\nAn illustration came early on when Riyad Mahrez found David Silva along the left; he had time to engineer an opening but this yielded nothing. Mahrez then committed a howler \u2013 the first of many from City \u2013 that had Guardiola crouching in anguish. This was a pass that went straight to Jim\u00e9nez. He sprinted at Ederson down the middle and Fernandinho was needed to perform a double-block: first with a leg, then via his head when Patrick Cutrone followed up.\n\nOtamendi had been beaten with ease when Jim\u00e9nez made room for his effort. Now, the Argentinian hit a second loose City pass. Again, Jim\u00e9nez was the beneficiary. This time a combination of Fernandinho and Ederson kept the scores level, the No 9 ending on top of the latter in a sight reminiscent of mixed-martial arts.\n\nGuardiola has discussed the need to be more solid at the back with regard to eliminating \u201cclear chances\u201d. What he was witnessing was City proving most at sea since Stones went down last month.\n\nFive successive victories and only one goal conceded had followed. Yet when Jim\u00e9nez skated past Jo\u00e3o Cancelo along the right and crossed, the ball travelled across the area to the unmarked R\u00faben Vinagre as more gaps were exposed. City rushed towards the winger, though, and a shot that might have troubled Ederson was deflected away.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City players are disconsolate after Wolves\u2019 second goal guaranteed their defeat.

The problem, though, was a lack of a consistent edge near Patr\u00edcio\u2019s goal. When the blue wave next went at Wolves Raheem Sterling did cause the goalkeeper to beat the ball out. More encouragement came via a Cancelo shot, a Sergio Ag\u00fcero header back at goal, and a Silva cross. Yet, Wolves held firm. As Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo noted afterwards his players pressing in numbers caused City to hurry. When Cancelo collected in front of the Wolves D, four black-shirted opponents stymied him.\n\nBy the break City could reflect on a late Kyle Walker attempt, saved by Patr\u00edcio, but the vulnerability in the rearguard was their glaring problem.\n\nThe City full-back, recovering from an infection, was replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko for the second half. This meant Cancelo going to right-back and the Ukrainian taking his berth.\n\nCity, though, remained open to the counterattack. A Cutrone burst had Rodri scything him down, causing Craig Pawson to book the midfielder, the referee also showing yellow to Cancelo for an infringement earlier in the move.\n\nIf J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear: City lacked the vibrancy and ruthlessness that had swept them to the last two titles.\n\nIf J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear. City are lacking the vibrancy and ruthlessness that has swept them to their last two titles. The stuttering display had Guardiola introducing Bernardo Silva for Mahrez on the hour. Yet City frustration continued. David Silva seemed to make a fair challenge near Wolves\u2019 area but Pawson gave a foul. Nuno\u2019s men moved upfield and won a corner. Ederson complained about the initial decision and was booked.\n\nThere was better when David Silva crashed a free-kick off Patr\u00edcio\u2019s bar and in the ensuing action the same player went close with a hooked effort.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s final substitution was telling: on came Gabriel Jesus \u2013 not for Ag\u00fcero but David Silva, the manager feeling the need for both strikers.\n\nIt yielded nothing as this ended as the black-shirted Wolves\u2019 first league triumph over City in nine years. Nuno\u2019s side can boast a fine victory that moves them up to mid-table while City stare at a yawning gap to Liverpool well before the clocks go back at the end of the month at the end of the month. Their two defeats make this City\u2019s poorest start since 2013-14. City finished that season as champions but were only three points behind the leaders at this stage.\n\nThere is enough time to erase the current deficit but what may privately worry Guardiola is how sluggish his players look so early in the campaign. They had done so, too, at Everton last Saturday before eventually winning 3-1.\n\nThis was City\u2019s first home league defeat since going down 3-2 to Crystal Palace on 22 December last year. Now, the manager will need the impending international break to regroup ahead of resuming the championship defence in a fortnight.", "description": "Manchester City were left eight points behind Liverpool after a 2-0 home defeat by a Wolves side that wasted early chances but took the points thanks to Adama Traor\u00e9", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f594c21ff71ebf679f549700d7363ca77596c5b/1234_650_2681_1608/master/2681.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08fa5aa55972bea0b7444a7896c71429", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
