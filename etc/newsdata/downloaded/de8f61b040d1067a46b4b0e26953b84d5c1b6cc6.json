(AP) - Daniel Jones has become one of the hottest commodities in the New York City metropolitan area, and beyond.\n\nLook at the lead to most of the local sports shows, and even some national shows. It\u2019s mostly about the Giants rookie quarterback. The videotape of the kid from Duke scampering into the end zone from 7-yards to cap a 32-31 come-from-behind win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is being played three days later.\n\nWhen Jones talked before the full media Wednesday as the Giants (1-2) began preparations for Sunday\u2019s game against the winless Washington Redskins, it was a feeding frenzy.\n\nThere were 11 camera crews, photographers, beat writers and more columnists than usual around to listen to the new-found folk hero, who replaced two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning and put some life back into the season.\n\nAsking a question in the roughly 10-minute interview period was like a shouting match.\n\nThe Giants even changed their normal routine. Manning used to speak in front of his locker on Wednesdays. Jones was on the patio at the team facilities in the Meadowlands to give everyone a little room.\n\nWhat was interesting was Jones didn\u2019t change in the least. He came off as a low-key Manning clone when the Giants took him with the sixth pick overall in the draft and nothing changed after his career started in spectacular fashion, running for two touchdowns and passing for two more.\n\nWhen asked about his new celebrity status, a wry smile appeared on his face.\n\nIt was hard to tell whether Jones was amused, surprised or even liked it. The 22-year-old laughed a little. He said his life has not changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI go home and then I come into work every day. But no, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s changed a whole lot.\u201d\n\nHe said he is aware that he is in more demand and he has received more messages from family and friends, telling him what they see.\n\n\u201cBut like you said, I\u2019m trying to focus on this week, focus on what we\u2019re doing here and making sure that I\u2019m preparing myself to play as well as I can this week.\u201d\n\nJones hit 23 of 36 passes for 336 yards and become the first Giants quarterback with at least two passing and two rushing touchdowns in a game since Nov. 28, 1948, when Charlie Conerly did it against the Boston Yankees.\n\nJones also is the second quarterback since the 1970 merger to throw for at least 300 yards and two touchdowns and run for two scores in his starting debut.\n\nThe next step is doing it again Sunday.\n\n\u201cI think, like I said, there is a whole lot that I need to clean up to do better,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll focus on that, I\u2019ll lock in on those things this week and hopefully play better on Sunday. I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d\n\nGiants coach Pat Shurmur had a funny line when asked if Jones either had changed in any way since the weekend or if he was carrying himself any differently.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking if he has a big head?\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re asking? No. No. Not at all. I see the same player I saw last week preparing to play his first game.\u201d\n\nSterling Shepard, who caught one of Jones\u2018 two TD passes, had played his entire career with Manning. But he was impressed how Jones lifted the team after an 0-2 start. He played well and he used a few words in the huddle that caught teammates by surprised. He cursed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s smart and he plays with a lot of poise,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cYou can see that, and you usually don\u2019t see that out of a rookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the things he did were crazy,\u201d added center Jon Halapio, who said the one play that stood out to him was the game-winning, fourth-down touchdown run up the middle with 1:16 to play.\n\nIt\u2019s the play that keeps showing up on television.\n\nJones has seen it a few times. When asked if he ever turned the channel, he sounded like Manning.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t change it,\u201d he said.\n\nComing from the celebrity, it drew laughter.\n\nNOTES: LB Alec Ogletree (hamstring), LB Tae Davis (concussion), RB Saquon Barkley (ankle), DT Olsen Pierre (knee) and WR Russell Shepard (foot) did not practice. LB Lorenzo Carter (elbow) and WRs Bennie Fowler (hamstring) and Cody Latimer (concussion) were limited. \u2026 RB Wayne Gallman will start for Barkley, who will be sidelined for an extended time, according to Shurmur. \u201cI view it as a big opportunity, an opportunity I\u2019ve had since I came into the league. It\u2019s unfortunate for my brother to go out, but this is what I\u2019ve prepared for,\u201d Gallman said. \u2026 The Giants will probably sign RB Jon Hilliman to the practice squad. With Barkley out, Eli Penny is the only other RB.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Daniel Jones has become one of the hottest commodities in the New York City metropolitan area, and beyond.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/young_quarterbacks_football_52837_c0-113-2706-1690_s1770x1032.jpg?3e005f2efc9ea63c9211dd5f9c27d21d6369b801", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
