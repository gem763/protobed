Because the cancer must have this gene to produce, once edited the cancer dies.\n\n\u201cIn our study, the treated mice have 100% survival and no tumours.\n\n(Image: Science Photo Library RF)\n\n\"The mice showed no other clinical signs such as inflammation from treatment but there may be other gene changes we haven\u2019t measured yet.\n\n\u201cOther cancers can be treated once we know the right genes.\u201d\n\nWhile the findings are undoubtedly exciting, it\u2019s important to note that the technology has only been tested on mice so far, and it remains unclear if it will have the same effect in humans.\n\nDespite this, the researchers say that they\u2019re working towards human trials of the gene therapy \u2018in the next five years.\u2019", "description": "Researchers from Griffith University used gene-editing technology called CRISPR to cure the disease - and believe the same technology could be used to treat cervical cancer in humans", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Griffith News", "Science Photo Library Rf"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12791891.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Human-papilloma-virus-illustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
