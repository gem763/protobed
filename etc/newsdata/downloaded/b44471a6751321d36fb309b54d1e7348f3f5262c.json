But we are chasing high standards in this team and while the scoreboard shows we played well, there is definitely things we can work on. It is the second game and while it is going well, it is important to remember what we need to work on,\u201d Pienaar said.\n\n\u201cWe have a tough game against Munster next week and then we have a tough tour. For us it is important to work on the standards we have set for ourself and consistency\n\n\u201cTo get that momentum with the team is for me personally great. I have a bunch of friends at Ulster and it was nice getting one over them but we will work hard for the turnaround to face Munster on Friday.\u201d\n\nPienaar said he had enjoyed catching up with his former team-mates, but said there would be no favours done after that result when the teams meet in the return game in Belfast later this season.\n\n\u201cI was pretty relaxed and met up with some of their guys for a coffee. For me it is always fun to play against friends of yours and old teams \u2013 it was the same against the Sharks in the Currie Cup. I have great memories and had a great time at Ulster,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI guess it was mixed emotions running out against them. I\u2019m glad we got the win but they\u2019ve already said it is round one and they will be waiting for us. It will be a different story in Belfast. But for now Munster is next up for us and we need to get a result.\u201d\n\nPienaar said while Ulster struggled with the altitude, it shouldn\u2019t take away from some of the impressive tries his side scored. Anthony Volminck\u2019s hat-trick and a brace by Rhyno Smith electrified the contest as the Cheetahs were never troubled in the game.\n\n\u201cAltitude definitely played a part but in saying that we were pretty accurate at stages and we were tough to contain. We made some good decisions and ran some good lines. When we broke the line we managed to take those opportunities,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Port Elizabeth the Southern Kings were disappointed with their result after leading Irish side Munster early in the second half, before losing out late in the game 31-20. Kings\u2019 coach Robbi Kempson rued missed opportunities for the second week in a row.\n\n\u201cAgain it was missed opportunities - we had two try-scoring opportunities in that opening 20 minutes that we didn\u2019t convert. I wouldn\u2019t say we panicked but we didn\u2019t convert. That is a minimum of coming away with 10 points and that would have helped with the scoreline in the game.\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t taking your opportunities then you are going to be on the back foot. And in this competition and particularly against a team like Munster you aren\u2019t going to win games,\u201d Kempson said.\n\nBut while he was disappointed he took positives out of the game.\n\n\u201cI think it is the first time in the history of the Southern Kings that we didn\u2019t get a yellow card. We got a turnover scrum and stopped their mauls, so there is a lot of positives to take out of it. From our attack perspective we train hard and it doesn\u2019t seem to play itself out on the field, so in that respect we are disappointed, but we can\u2019t fault the effort.\n\n\u201cThe energy was a bit flat in the heat, our intention was to lift the intensity in the heat, because they wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with that, but we didn\u2019t do that. Perhaps we were slightly off in that, particularly at the start.\u201d\n\nThe sides will swop opposition this week with the Cheetahs hosting Munster on Friday while Ulster will travel to Port Elizabeth to take on the Kings.", "description": "Cheetahs captain Ruan Pienaar admitted he enjoyed his side\u2019s massive win over his old club Ulster.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9223/1434572485544151b543986bff6424f7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
