Please don\u2019t assume what worked for you this year will serve you best next year.\n\nIn addition to reviewing your prescription drug plan, Jones recommends checking that your physicians and hospitals are still part of your plan.\n\n\u201cI found out that my current plan dropped the local hospital as a provider so needless to say, I\u2019m researching other plans,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nJones says he does his homework every year. This year, he\u2019ll spend about 40 or 50 hours over a month comparing plan benefits.\n\nAD\n\nYou would be wise to take his advice during open enrollment for Medicare, which runs until Dec. 7.\n\nHere are some additional warnings from other readers about Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs.\n\n\u2014 \u201cOne thing to be aware of when looking at Part D plans is that the same medication can be on a different tier, depending upon the particular plan.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s Part D prescription coverage that has the greatest potential to broadside retirees with high and often unexpected drug costs. All Part D plans I\u2019ve reviewed will hit you hard if you are prescribed name-brand tier 3, 4 or 5 drugs.\u201d (Generally, a drug in a lower tier cost less than those in a higher tier.)\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cLong story short is that my wife and I will save $720 in 2020 on prescriptions. Folks you must read your ANOC (Annual Notice of Change).\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPhilip Moeller \u2014 author of \u201cGet What\u2019s Yours for Medicare: Maximize Your Coverage, Minimize Your Costs\u201d almost made a costly mistake a few years ago during open enrollment. He recounted his near slip-up to Sally Squires, a former Washington Post Health writer.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get a chance to check his Medicare Part D drug coverage plan until one day before Medicare open season ended,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe discovered that a key medication he needed had been dropped from his drug plan\u2019s list of covered drugs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMoeller told Squires that it would have cost him $20,000 a year to buy the drug on his own. Fortunately, he was able to find another plan that covered the drug he needed.\n\nTo help you review your options, check out the redesigned Medicare Plan Finder on medicare.gov.\n\nAD\n\nMoeller, who writes a blog for PBS NewsHour, took the updated tool on a test drive before open enrollment began.\n\nWhat mix of #Medicare benefits and costs works best with your needs and budget?

Don\u2019t leave home without it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHealth-care costs are no joke, so take the time to review your plan this year.
