It is important to take action that can help save your lives.\u201d\n\nAt least two landslides were already confirmed, with a man in his sixties killed in one in Gunma north of Tokyo.\n\nBy early evening, tens of thousands were in shelters and receiving emergency rations and blankets, though a 5.7-magnitude quake that rattled the Tokyo area did little to calm nerves.\n\nAmong the evacuees were people whose homes were damaged by a powerful typhoon that hit the region last month.\n\n\u201cI evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I\u2019m so worried about my house,\u201d a 93-year-old man told national broadcaster NHK as he sheltered at a centre in Tateyama in Chiba east of Tokyo.\n\nIn Yokohama, outside of Tokyo, others hunkered down in their homes despite the storm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 77 and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Hidetsugu Nishimura told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe can hear an infernal din from the rain and the wind, and a fragment of the roof has gone. For an hour, the house was shaking from wind and rain.\u201d\n\nEven in the hours before the storm neared land, its outer bands brought tornado-like gusts of wind to Chiba, east of Tokyo, where one home was destroyed and several damaged.\n\nFive people including a three-year-old boy were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Rugby, F1 disrupted \u2013\n\nIn Gotemba, west of Tokyo, the fire department said it had rescued one man who fell into a swollen canal but was still searching for a second man.\n\nThe JMA has forecast half a metre (20 inches) of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region, but many rivers were already close to breaching their banks by Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn Kanagawa, authorities implemented an emergency discharge as the Shiroyama dam reached capacity, with warnings issued for people living downstream.\n\nAcross the regions affected by the storm, more than 180,000 people lost power.\n\nAnd everything from auto plants to the country\u2019s ubiquitous convenience stores, usually open 24 hours a day, shut their doors.\n\nThe storm has forced the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.\n\nIt could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that game until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.\n\nScotland face elimination if the match is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\nAnd organisers warned Saturday night that a Namibia-Canada fixture could be cancelled in Kamaishi, which was hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after Typhoon Faxai hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Powerful Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan on Saturday, killing at least two people and prompting authorities to issue their highest", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/a3a710_hours-worst-storm-arrived-its-outer-bands-killed-man-damaged-houses-in-chiba-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
