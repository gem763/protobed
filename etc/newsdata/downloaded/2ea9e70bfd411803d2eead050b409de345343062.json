She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren\u2019t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin.\n\n\u201cI thought: \u2018Why not G\u00f6rlitz?\u2019\u201d said Bodenm\u00fcller, a freelance journalist .\n\nG\u00f6rlitz, Germany\u2019s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader. But its pastel-coloured old town, which draws 140,000 tourists a year, hides a darker reality.\n\nWe have the feeling it doesn\u2019t matter whether we stay here. We\u2019re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment Carsten Borck\n\nThe city has Germany\u2019s lowest wages and one of the country\u2019s highest shares of far-right voters. After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, easterners fled west in droves, driving G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s population down more than 25% to 54,000 in 2013.\n\nCity officials decided they needed to do something to reverse this trend, and hit upon the idea of offering a free one-month stay, no strings attached.\n\nOther cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.\n\nThe proportion of workers who conduct their business remotely is growing. Already, millions of people spend much of their adult lives hopscotching from one place to another, perhaps including the occasional work-tourism visit to Medell\u00edn or Tokyo. The officials behind G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s programme figured it could both attract some of those nomadic workers and give them the chance to learn some lessons on how to reverse its population decline.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Disused buildings in G\u00f6rlitz, eastern Germany.

We\u2019re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.\u201d\n\nThe G\u00f6rlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK.\n\nThe 54 individuals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work.\n\nIt\u2019s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks Eva Bodenm\u00fcller\n\nThough the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to G\u00f6rlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany\u2019s smaller cities. \u201cOur aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,\u201d said IZS head Robert Knippschild.\n\nG\u00f6rlitz is a fascinating place to test these theories. The city has around 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is a third higher than the national average. This, in part, is why G\u00f6rlitz has taken in 1,200 refugees. But surveys have shown immigration to be the most urgent issue for residents of eastern Germany, where the far right has taken hold.\n\nG\u00f6rlitz has not seen the sort of xenophobic violence that has struck Chemnitz and Dresden, but has been called \u201cthe living room\u201d of the nativist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. This year the AfD came out on top in G\u00f6rlitz in the European parliament elections and the state election on 1 September, polling at more than 37%, and also won the first round of the mayoral election, though the Christian Democratic Union candidate, Octavian Ursu, won the runoff in June.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest G\u00f6rlitz mayor Octavian Ursu believes the key to creating more jobs is a more welcoming society. Photograph: Sebastian Kahnert/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt was a tough campaign,\u201d said Ursu, a Romanian immigrant who played lead trumpet in the local philharmonic orchestra before turning to politics. He says he wants to put the animosity of the election in the past, and sees Testing the City as part of a budding revival which includes a new data analysis centre employing 120 scientists and engineers, a Siemens hydrogen technologies innovation campus that will employ another 100, and a \u20ac36m (\u00a332m) facelift for the art nouveau municipal hall.\n\nUrsu believes the key to creating jobs is a more welcoming society. \u201cI\u2019ve said to the people, you must think about whether you want to have an open city, a European city, or a closed city,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is not a settled question in G\u00f6rlitz. A July report on the project by the German news outlet Deutsche Welle attracted sharp comments online. \u201cThe incentive to lure you here is just the desperate attempt of our city to fight the shrinking population,\u201d said YouTube user Polter Geist. \u201cThey hope your leftwing alternative garbage will appeal to the youth.\u201d\n\nThis project is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of G\u00f6rlitz Robert Knippschild\n\nDuring their stay, Bodenm\u00fcller and Borck have sought to engage with these issues directly. Borck staged a show of his work at the Europa Haus gallery, with posters asking passersby questions such as \u201cAm I welcome here?\u201d and \u201cHow do I know you are not a Nazi?\u201d.\n\nThe couple said they spent a lot of time talking to locals and found a city of extremes. \u201cIn other places you generally have people from different groups talking to each other,\u201d said Bodenm\u00fcller, who has lived in Berlin, Munich and several smaller towns. \u201cBut here there is no centre \u2013 there are just the two sides.\u201d\n\nAnother project participant, Nikolas Kammerer, 34, a photographer from Leipzig, sees the locals as one of the city\u2019s main draws. He found it refreshing that artists and creative workers in G\u00f6rlitz are not looking to become YouTube stars or Instagram influencers, but instead are laser-focused on producing and collaborating. He credits his month in the city for his first successful commission for the German news outlet Die Zeit: a portrait series of local voters on election day. \u201cIn Leipzig I probably wouldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest G\u00f6rlitz has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in several Hollywood films, but in reality has Germany\u2019s lowest wages and one of the highest proportions of far-right voters. Photograph: Jens Meyer/AP\n\nHe also saw the other perspective, at a far-right election rally where the AfD candidate denounced foreigners as criminals and the crowd chanted \u201cLugen Presse!\u201d (\u201clying press!\u201d). \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d said Kammerer, whose grandmother is from G\u00f6rlitz. \u201cMost of these far-right people don\u2019t want to talk to the media, which is a problem because I want to have them represented in my work.\u201d\n\nWith the project about halfway through, four participants have committed to move to G\u00f6rlitz, including German-Finnish poet Mark Mallon and his wife, Finnish artist Venla Saalo. The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in G\u00f6rlitz in April. \u201cG\u00f6rlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is a great combination for creative work.\u201d\n\nWandering stars: are Tallinn's digital nomads building the city of the future? Read more\n\nBorck and Bodenm\u00fcller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish G\u00f6rlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,\u201d said Bodenm\u00fcller. \u201cIf we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.\u201d\n\nKnippschild\u2019s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing.\n\n\u201cPeople are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,\u201d he said of the participants. \u201cThis is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of G\u00f6rlitz.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Picturesque G\u00f6rlitz is offering free lodging and studio space in exchange for feedback on what potential residents want from a city", "authors": ["David Lepeska"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a15a22e148defc5a980551f92098c299f9dee89/0_198_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=032e299aa4201b4c3e84bafc7a7b4182", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
