Elijah Cummings on Friday. That was after his wife, Hillary Clinton, seemingly compared the Trump administration to the Book of Ahab in her own eulogy. Several prominent lawmakers had gathered to pay their respects to Cummings at The New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore.\n\nClinton repeatedly compared Rep. Cummings to the prophet Elijah in the Bible, including how the two figures \"stood against the corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\"\n\n.@HillaryClinton on Rep. Elijah Cummings: \"Like that Old Testament prophet, he stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\"\n\n\n\nFull video here: https://t.co/3Nt7BSmMFq pic.twitter.com/lnHZvVENKC \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 25, 2019\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause and gave each other knowing looks.\n\n\"Our Elijah was a fierce champion for truth, justice, and kindness in every part of his life,\" she continued. \"His integrity and character, his can do spirit, made him a guiding light in Congress.\"\n\nThe remainder of the speeches largely focused on Cummings, sans politics. President Obama, like President Clinton, commended Cummings for having befriended people of all political stripes during his tenure in Washington. He was, Obama explained, a role model.\n\n\"You're not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect,\" Obama said.\n\nA day earlier, when Cummings laid in state at the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) got emotional recalling his \"unexpected friendship\" with the Maryland Democrat. He said he was \"blessed\" to have had a confidant like him.\n\nCummings died last week in Baltimore from longstanding health issues.", "description": ".10/25/2019 17:58:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/91a64dbb-6549-4545-be71-b3201d31f72a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
