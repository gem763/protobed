Pakistan ominously hinted it was convening its National Command Authority, the institution which can authorize a nuclear strike.\n\nThe two states, which have retained an adversarial relationship since their founding in 1947, between them deploy nuclear warheads that can be delivered by land, air and sea.\n\nHowever, those weapons are inferior in number and yield to the thousands of nuclear weapons possessed by Russia and the United States, which include megaton-class weapons that can wipe out a metropolis in a single blast.\n\nSome commenters have callously suggested that means a \u201climited regional nuclear war\u201d would remain an Indian and Pakistani problem. People find it difficult to assess the risk of rare but catastrophic events; after all, a full-scale nuclear war has never occurred before, though it has come close to happening.\n\nSuch assessments are not only shockingly callous but shortsighted. In fact, several studies have modeled the global impact of a \u201climited\u201d ten-day nuclear war in which India and Pakistan each exchange fifty 15-kiloton nuclear bombs equivalent in yield to the Little Boy uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nTheir findings concluded that spillover would in no way be \u201climited,\u201d directly impacting people across the globe that would struggle to locate Kashmir on a map.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Soot particles may also deplete between 30 to 50 percent of the ozone layer, allowing more of the sun\u2019s radiation to penetrate the atmosphere, causing increased sunburns and rates of cancer.
