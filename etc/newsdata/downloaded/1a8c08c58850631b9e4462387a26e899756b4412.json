He was sent to hospital but confirmed dead,\u201d Hiroki Yashiro, a spokesman at Ichihara Fire Department, in Chiba, told AFP.\n\nHagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated \u201cvery strong\u201d to hit the main island of Honshu since 1991, when the category system was introduced, local media said.\n\nBy midday, 1.64 million people in the affected area were under non-mandatory evacuation orders, with authorities urging the elderly, disabled and those with children to leave early.\n\nHagibis is an unusually large storm, expected to bring \u201cbrutal winds and violent seas\u201d to large swathes of the country, the weather agency said.\n\nThe expected rainfall, in particular, has sparked concern, with the JMA warning that high tides ahead of a full moon increase the risk of flooding.\n\nIt has issued warnings for strong winds, high waves, landslides and serious flooding for large areas of Honshu.\n\n\u2013 Power outages \u2013\n\nWith the centre of the storm still hundreds of kilometres away in the Pacific, torrential rain was falling and tornado-like gusts of wind ripped into several homes in Chiba, destroying one.\n\nFive people including a three-year-old boy were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.\n\nThe JMA has forecast half a metre of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region.\n\nTelevision footage showed gigantic waves smashing into coastal breakwaters and residents living near a river in Tokyo piling up sandbags in front of their houses.\n\nOthers have nailed wooden boards to the frames of windows.\n\nBy 9:00am local time (0000GMT) 11,600 households in Chiba had already lost power. The region was badly hit by another powerful typhoon in September.\n\nAutomakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.\n\n\u2013 Rugby, F1 disrupted \u2013\n\nThe storm has also thrown two major sporting events into disarray, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and forcing the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.\n\nThe storm could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that game until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.\n\nScotland face elimination if the match is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\nThe storm is also causing transport chaos over a long weekend in Japan.\n\nJapanese airlines have scrapped more than 1,660 domestic flights and some 260 international flights on Saturday, NHK said.\n\nMany bullet train lines from the capital are suspended, along with both overground and some subway lines serving the Tokyo area.\n\nThe storm has also forced the first all-day typhoon closure of Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks, with doors shut from Saturday until at least noon on Sunday.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba.\n\nMore than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in affected buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Powerful Typhoon Hagibis on Saturday claimed its first victim even before making landfall, as potentially record-breaking rains and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/01d849_typhoon-hagibis-has-forced-cancellation-flights-bullet-trains-local-lines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
