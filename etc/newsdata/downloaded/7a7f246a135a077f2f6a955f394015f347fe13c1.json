CEO Tim Cook opened the doors of the glass cube that leads down into the store promptly at 8 a.m. with throngs of Apple fans and onlookers gathered around.\n\nI toured the store as it opened to customers, and its new look is certainly more airy and open than before. Apple not only expanded the underground store, but also added a series of mirror-glass skylenses along with 62 skylights that fill the store with natural light.\n\nThe first costumer to buy an iPhone 11 exits from the newly renovated Apple Store at Fifth Avenue on September 20, 2019 in New York City.

The mirror-like surface of the elevator that brings customers from the plaza to the store shimmers in the new lighting surrounding it.\n\nApple says the store's ceiling is made of a curved fabric that is backlit to emulate the natural light of the sun depending on the time of day. As the day goes on the light changes in real-time.\n\nApple will be hosting a number of its Today at Apple events daily at the new store, with artists from various media passing through to give customers tips on how to best take advantage of their devices.\n\nOf course, the store's main showcases are the Apple products on sale. Rows of wooden tables throughout the store are filled with Apple's new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, as well the Apple Watch Series 5, MacBooks, and more.\n\nThe 5th Ave. store is Apple's most well-known location, and every detail of the structure is important. The walls, for example, look as though they are made of the same material and use the same styling as those used at Apple's campus in Cupertino, California.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook poses for a selfie after opening the newly renovated Apple Store at Fifth Avenue on September 20, 2019 in New York City.

According to Apple, the site sees more annual visitors than the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building.\n\nNaturally, Apple hopes they all walk away with those new devices in their hands as they leave.\n\nMore from Dan:\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.\n\n\n\n", "description": "After a two-year wait, Apple on Friday finally unveiled a redesigned version of its iconic flagship Apple Store on 5th Ave.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dp8Zxt0epM1mVD3CGQ5VoA--~B/aD0yMzA0O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/0b662950-dbbc-11e9-b6f9-79e8ae0bc477", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
