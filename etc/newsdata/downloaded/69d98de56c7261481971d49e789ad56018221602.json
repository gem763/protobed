The 20-year-old Czech prospect has three career NHL goals.\n\nMrazek made only a handful of tough saves after the first period, in which he stopped 17 shots.\n\nDrew Doughty went down with an apparent injury after getting boarded by Carolina captain Jordan Staal deep in the Hurricanes' end of the ice with 1:14 to play, although Doughty eventually skated off to the dressing room without much help.\n\nThe Kings pulled Campbell but couldn't score on the ensuing 6-on-4 power play. Teuvo Ter\u00e4v\u00e4inen took the puck from Sean Walker and flung it toward the net, and it tipped off Aho for an empty-netter with seven seconds to play.\n\nStaal played in his 900th career game, joining Phil Kessel and Nicklas Backstrom as the members of the NHL draft class of 2006 to reach the mark.\n\nNOTES: Los Angeles Chargers LB Thomas Davis dropped the ceremonial first puck alongside teammates Desmond King and Mike Williams. Davis spent the previous 14 seasons with the Carolina Panthers, earning three Pro Bowl selections. ... Brian Gibbons made his debut for the Hurricanes, who signed him in July. Carolina is the sixth NHL team for the 31-year-old center, who split last season between Anaheim and Ottawa. ... Although he was activated last Saturday, Carolina D Trevor Van Riemsdyk still hasn't played this season while he returns from a shoulder injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHurricanes: Visit the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday night on the second of three stops in California.\n\nKings: Host the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night in the fourth of five home games in eight days.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
