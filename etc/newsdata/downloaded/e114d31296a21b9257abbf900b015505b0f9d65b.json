The twins, the divided personality? \u201cEverybody\u2019s got two sides. But mine are very pronounced.\u201d\n\nIn her autobiography Unzipped, she tells me, she wrote with two voices: \u201cI found it easier to have \u2018Little Suzi from Detroit\u2019 speak, and 'Suzi Quatro' speak.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with Little Suzi. She was born into an Italian-American family (the surname was actually Quattrocchi \u2013 the more catchy abbreviation was reputedly coined by the immigration authorities). Her auto factory worker dad was also a musician, which he passed on to his six kids. Quatro began on drums and piano and picked up bass later.\n\nIn 1964, her older sister formed a pop quintet called the Pleasure Seekers with two friends and two sisters, in which 14-year-old Suzi played bass. Managed by Quatro\u2019s brother, they toured extensively and released singles.\n\nShe was talent-spotted by an English record producer Mickie Most, and quit the band to cross the Atlantic in 1971 for her shot at fame. This was a source of deep family resentment which, fully five decades later, gets a pretty intense airing in the new documentary by Australian director Liam Firmager.\n\nSuzi Quatro, in trademark leather, in Sydney for a series of concerts in November 1974. Trevor Dallen\n\nThere\u2019s a punchy scene where her family sends Quatro, by then living in England, a tape cassette for Thanksgiving. She\u2019s expecting a homely, comforting message, but instead it\u2019s a recording of them criticising her musicianship and generally taking her down a peg. The malice makes you squirm.\n\n\u201cThere were five of us all in the business at one time or another and I got plucked out. So I can understand it, where it comes from,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that was 50 years ago, get over it. And tell it to myself, get over it \u2013 because it still hurts. It\u2019s like an open wound.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mickie Most dressed her up in that leather catsuit and teamed her up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman (an Australian), with whom she pumped out a bunch of hits. She never really made it in the States and had mixed fortunes in Britain, but through the '70s and early '80s she was big in Europe \u2013 and absolutely massive in Australia.\n\nQuatro doesn\u2019t really have a theory about why Australians are so receptive. I speculate that although Australia is considered a bit of a macho place, there's a distinctive strain of toughness in the female side of our national psyche. Perhaps we just better understand this ballsy, brash, bass-playing rocker?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s not sure. \u201cMaybe. It\u2019s hard to understand where it comes from. I was huge in Japan too, which is the opposite. I mean, women walk behind \u2013 give me a break, can you ever see me doing that?\u201d\n\nAs she recorded, and toured, and recorded, and toured, and as her fame grew, Little Suzi learned to be Suzi Quatro \u2013 the pin-up on a million bedroom walls, the actress in Happy Days, the rock star she\u2019d always wanted to be.\n\nI wasn\u2019t really a drugs and drinks person whatsoever. I never drink when I go on stage, not a drop. \u2014 Suzi Quatro\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t include the standard Hollywood-style narrative of wealth and fame become intoxicating, overwhelming, and ending up in moral or financial ruin.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really a drugs and drinks person whatsoever. I never drink when I go on stage, not a drop. Afterwards I\u2019ll have a glass of something, sure, because you\u2019re high as a kite,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThis is what has saved me all these years. I go on the road and I do what I do, and then I come back. My husband always says, \u2018You\u2019re the wild one on stage and the mild one off\u2019.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the Gemini, then: manic energy on stage, the very essence of a rock n\u2019roll wild child; twinned with beatific calm off stage, the poetry-writing mother of two who lives a quiet rural life.\n\nBut as we work through our main meal \u2013 a very decent halibut for me, aubergine for Quatro \u2013 she also goes on to describe herself another way, in which she\u2019s not at all bifurcated. In this version, the stage Suzi, while high-octane, is the real Suzi.\n\n\u201cThere are two people, because there\u2019s a performer, naturally there\u2019s a performer, so there\u2019s a private person as well. But pretty much what you see is what you get. Here I am. I go on stage, I do what I do, that\u2019s a huge part of me, I come off stage and here I am.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this vein, she talks a lot about truth, about being true to yourself, and about showing people your real self, about being accessible to her admirers.\n\nShe doesn't do the wig, cap and sunglasses when out shopping, and is actually happy when fans approach her to say hi. And on tour, people have paid to see her so she\u2019ll \u201cgo out there and be good\u201d: \u201cI\u2019ve got to entertain as best I can. You get all of me on stage, I give it all.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t do gender, I believe in being whoever you are, whoever that may be. Don\u2019t put any limits on me. \u2014 Suzi Quatro\n\nThis is certainly the impression I\u2019m getting. She knows exactly who she is, and she is completely candid.\n\nEarly days in leather.\n\nWe talk about a new film she\u2019s writing that dramatises her life story \u2013 still picking at that scab of family rupture. We talk about her new album, instigated by her guitar-playing son, who took her back to her hard-rock roots (\u201che pushed my Suzi Quatro buttons\u201d). And we talk about what it\u2019s like to tour, and how every audience asks something slightly different of her.\n\nOf course she\u2019s been interviewed 10,000 times, but she seems genuine and authentic. You get the same sense from the new documentary. By the end of it, you have a real sense of who she is, and why she matters.\n\nAs the film\u2019s promo says: \u201cIn 1973, there were almost no women in rock, and absolutely none who played bass and sang lead vocals and led the band and rocked out \u2026 rewriting the rule book for the expected image of women in rock and roll.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t don the cloak of feminist icon though. \u201cI don\u2019t do gender, I believe in being whoever you are, whoever that may be. It doesn\u2019t matter, male, female, strong, weak ... Don\u2019t put any limits on me, I\u2019m allowed to be who I am.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve ordered a cheese platter. But she\u2019s had a long day \u2013 she wants to get home and get ready to fly out to Australia the next day. Does touring take it out of you as you get older?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think about it. My husband always says, after a show, \u2018you\u2019re not even out of breath\u2019. And I\u2019m running on the stage with a bass guitar and a leather suit on. I guess I\u2019ve trained a long time.\u201d\n\nQuatro has lived in the UK for decades, but tours Australia often. Domenico Pugliese\n\nIs it still as fun as it used to be? \u201cMore so, because I don\u2019t feel any pressure at all to be a certain kind of Suzi Quatro. I can go out there, I can talk to the audience, show them a picture, tell a joke, do this, whatever I do. So I can show them the whole rainbow.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s definitely time to hit the road. \u201cDid you get everything you need, picture-wise?\u201d she asks the photographer, ever the solicitous professional. \u201cI always try to give everybody their time.\u201d\n\nThe bill\n\nGalvin Green Man\n\nMain Road, Howe Street, Great Waltham\n\nNocellara olives \u00a33.50\n\nRoast aubergine, baby charred leeks, cumin yoghurt and smoked tomatoes \u00a314.00\n\nPan-seared pave of halibut, saffron arancini \u00a328.50\n\nFrench fries \u00a33.50\n\nCheese platter \u00a39.50\n\n2 x Hendricks gin with FeverTree slimline tonic \u00a324.00\n\nGM sparkling water \u00a32.50\n\nTotal \u00a385.50 ($161.17)\n\nQuatro's tour starts in Perth on October 27.
