This is just not normal. That should never, ever be normal,\u201d Rihanna said.\n\nShe said President Trump\u2019s characterization of the shooter as mentally ill was racist.\n\n\u201cAnd the fact that it\u2019s classified as something different because of the color of their skin? It\u2019s a slap in the face. It\u2019s completely racist,\u201d the Grammy-winner said. \u201cPut an Arab man with that same weapon in that same Walmart and there is no way that Trump would sit there and address it publicly as a mental health problem.\u201d\n\nRihanna has frequently used her social media accounts to attack Trump, railing against his immigration policies.\n\nThe \u201cLove on the Brain\u201d singer even sent a cease-and-desist letter to Trump last year when her single \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d was played at one of the president\u2019s rallies in Tennessee.\n\nNot for much longer\u2026me nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies, so thanks for the heads up philip! https://t.co/dRgRi06GrJ \u2014 Rihanna (@rihanna) November 5, 2018\n\nRihanna recently honored left-wing activist Shaun King at her annual Diamond Ball. But the celebration was criticized by fellow leftists over the way King treated a fellow activist earlier this year.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
