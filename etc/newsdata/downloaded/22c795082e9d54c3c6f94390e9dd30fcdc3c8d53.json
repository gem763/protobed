Then they signed the 26-year-old to a 1-year, $7.25 million contract during free agency this past offseason, making him the NFL\u2019s highest-paid backup quarterback.\n\nOver the next six weeks, at least, Bridgewater will have the chance to validate the Saints\u2019 faith in him. With the 40-year-old Brees reportedly expected to undergo thumb surgery this week to repair ligament damage, the Saints will give Bridgewater the opportunity to keep a promising season afloat and audition to be the franchise\u2019s heir apparent at quarterback.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if Saints fans are nervous about turning a Super Bowl-caliber roster over to Bridgewater. Not only has the former Minnesota Vikings first-round draft pick played very few meaningful snaps since a devastating 2016 knee injury, he also hasn\u2019t produced many highlights in his brief appearances in a Saints uniform.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here]\n\nBridgewater started in place of Brees in a meaningless Week 17 game last season, completing 14-of-22 passes for 118 yards behind a makeshift offensive line that included only one typical starter. He also performed only adequately during the preseason last month, completing a respectable 61.4 percent of his passes but getting out-played by jack-of-all-trades third stringer Taysom Hill.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was more of the same when Bridgewater came on in relief of Brees early in Sunday\u2019s 27-9 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He completed 17-of-30 passes for 165 yards and did not turn the ball over, but the Saints struggled to sustain drives with him under center, only advancing beyond the Rams\u2019 30-yard line twice in his eight possessions.\n\nThe Saints made a massive investment in Teddy Bridgewater, left, to fill in at quarterback just in case Drew Brees, right, went down. (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt was great to get the opportunity to go back out there and play football again,\u201d Bridgewater said. \u201cIt sucks that it had to happen the way that it did, but I appreciate every opportunity I get to play this game.\u201d\n\nThe surface-level reaction to the Saints\u2019 struggles on Sunday is that the transition from Brees to Bridgewater could be bumpy, but a more nuanced assessment suggests that\u2019s a bit premature. Ill-timed penalties, poor run blocking and too much pressure stymied the Saints\u2019 momentum as much as Bridgewater\u2019s errant passes or bad habit of holding the ball too long.\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton made a point of defending Bridgewater after Sunday\u2019s loss, blaming the quarterback\u2019s supporting cast for the lack of touchdowns. He noted that because of all the Saints\u2019 penalties, Bridgewater faced first-and-long or second-and-long scenarios on seemingly every drive.\n\n\u201cI thought he was ready to play,\u201d Payton said. \u201cHe\u2019s a pro. He knows how to win in this league. I didn\u2019t think we played particularly well around him. When we watch that tape tomorrow, it\u2019s not going to be pleasant for some guys.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not playing well up front, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your Hall of Fame guy or your No. 3 guy. It\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d\n\nPayton also shot down multiple questions about giving Hill an extended look at quarterback. Not only did Payton argue Bridgewater is more ready to fill in for Brees, he also pointed out that the Saints needed Hill at slot receiver after injuries left them thin at that position.\n\nThis offseason, Bridgewater turned down an opportunity to start for the Miami Dolphins in lieu of staying in New Orleans to back up Brees. Now, if Bridgewater can thrive in Brees\u2019 absence, it would be the culmination of a remarkable comeback. It was only a little over three years ago that Bridgewater blew out his knee in practice so severely that his surgeon likened it to a \u201cwar wound\u201d that kept him on the sidelines for more than a year.\n\nIn December 2017, Bridgewater appeared in an NFL game again. In December 2018, Bridgewater started a game for the first time since the injury.\n\nNow comes the real test: Meaningful playing time. He\u2019ll take the field Sunday in Seattle with the hopes of a Super Bowl-caliber team resting on his shoulders and the chance to entrench himself as Brees\u2019 successor in the palm of his hands.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Prior to the season, the Saints made Teddy Bridgewater the NFL\u2019s highest paid backup quarterback.
