Here are the top 15. Some of them are better than others.\n\nI\u2019ve added in my own personal reviews so you can ensure your Halloween costume is approved by someone on the internet who you\u2019ve never met.\n\n1. IT (Pennywise the evil clown)\n\nI\u2019d say I have an \u2018irrational fear of evil clowns\u2019 but, on reflection, that\u2019s a pretty rational thing to be afraid of. Clowns are simply terrifying \u2013 evil or not \u2013 and this costume has the advantage of actually being scary \u2013 a precious rarity in the era of the slutty Halloween costume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not my intention to slut-shame anyone: if you want to go out in the costume equivalent of a thirst-trap, bearing as much skin as is humanly possible, then you have my full and unconditional backing\u2026on literally any other night of the year.\n\nCall me a fusty old traditionalist, but Halloween is about being scary, goddamnit. It\u2019s about being spooktacular.\n\n2. Witch\n\nNow this is more like it. A time-honoured classic, it\u2019s the kind of Halloween costume that mum used to make.\n\nNot only are witches scary, but there has also been a historical revisionism around the subject in recent years, with historical witches viewed as both victims of misogynistic persecution and also, in some cases, women with an empowering degree of agency.\n\nThis has been accompanied by a trend of feminists embracing witch-craft: think of Lana del Rey putting a hex on Donald Trump. This doesn\u2019t appear to have been effective yet.\n\nSo going as a witch is actually pretty progressive \u2013 you could even go as far as to claim it as a radical feminist gesture. The patriarchy is shaking.\n\nSeason of the witch\u2026 (image:iStockphoto)\n\n3. Spider-Man\n\nOnly acceptable if you\u2019re a six-year-old child, to be honest. Grow up.\n\n4. Dinosaur\n\nThis is a cute option, but dinosaurs are just dangerous enough to make it appropriately frightening. You wouldn\u2019t want to get in a fight with a velociraptor in an Oceana smoking area, would you?\n\n5. Descendants\n\nI was really confused by this one as I thought it was referring to the 2011 film of the same name, a gently bittersweet family drama starring George Clooney \u2013 which seemed a bizarre source of inspiration for Halloween.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Descendants refers to a series of Disney films about the teenage children of classic villains (Jafar, Cruella de Vil, Maleficent and the Evil Queen from Snow White) and their attempts to navigate high school.\n\nWho knew? Finding out about the popularity of these films was the moment I was finally forced to accept that I am no longer down with the kids.\n\nThese villainous adolescents would make a decent costume but if you\u2019re over the age of 18, it risks looking a little creepy. Find someone your own age to dress up as, granddad.\n\n6. Clown\n\nIs this\u2026 a sexy evil clown? (image Ollie Millington/Getty Images)\n\nGiven that all clowns are evil, going as a regular clown is indistinguishable from going as an evil one. A solid costume but the only problem is: if you, personally, go out on Halloween dressed like this\u2026 how would people be able to tell the difference?\n\nBecause you\u2019re a clown. Get it?\n\n7. Fortnite\n\nI don\u2019t know what Fortnite is exactly but I gather it\u2019s a \u2018video game\u2019 of some sorts.\n\nIf you\u2019re a straight guy and considering dressing up as Fortnite for Halloween, why not save some time and money and simply wear a t-shirt that reads \u2018I have never before felt the loving touch of a woman\u2019?*\n\n*This is obviously a joke. Fortnite players are entirely able to find love.\n\n8. Chucky\n\nI used to find Chucky pretty scary until the other day, when I read this tweet:\n\nhow did chucky manage to murder so many people??? just pick him up and yeet him in the bin. he's a doll \u2014 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd8a \ud83e\udd87 (@thholyghost) October 16, 2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA solid costume, but if you step to me, I will yeet you in the bin.\n\n9. The 1980s\n\nWhat does this actually mean? A lot of stuff happened in the 1980s, and most of it was terrible.\n\nI\u2019m sceptical of 1980s nostalgia for this reason; it was an awful decade, one which saw the miners\u2019 strike, the AIDS crisis, the destruction of the very fabric of society from which, 30 years on, we are yet to recover.\n\nBut the clothes were pretty funny.\n\nGive this one a miss, unless you\u2019re going as zombie Thatcher, which undeniably would be pretty epic.\n\n10. Unicorns\n\nWell, unicorns aren\u2019t remotely scary so let\u2019s nip this twee nonsense in the bud.\n\nBut also, in the parlance of today, \u2018unicorn\u2019 refers to a bisexual woman who has threesomes with heterosexual couples. Quite an out-there costume choice \u2013 but maybe you could pull it off?\n\n11. Rabbit\n\nGoogle isn\u2019t giving any specific information about these searches so it\u2019s hard to say exactly what kind of rabbit we\u2019re dealing with here.\n\nIf you want to go a straight-up, cute rabbit, might I direct you towards a little known festival called Easter? That might be a little bit more your speed.\n\nIf you want to go as the nightmarish, apocalypse-warning rabbit from Donnie Darko, on the other hand, then I can only applaud your good taste and sophistication.\n\nIf you want to go as a sexy Playboy Bunny, well who am I, as a man, to deny your agency? You can, and should, dress as sexily as you want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you imagine for one second that such a costume embodies the true spirit of Halloween\u2026 you\u2019re lying to yourself, my friend.\n\n12. Pirate\n\nI\u2019m strongly in favour of costumes like this: nothing meta, no try-hard puns, no attempts at satire or social commentary, no wry allusions to Article 50 (this isn\u2019t Have I Got News For You, mate, it\u2019s Halloween \u2013 so wisen up and have a bit of respect)\u2026 it\u2019s just a good, old-fashioned pirate.\n\nAnd to that, I think we can all say: ahoy!\n\n13. Stranger Things\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the most popular Stranger Things-related costume this year will be the uniform Steve wears at Scoops Ahoy, the ice-cream parlour he\u2019s working at. This is not scary but it\u2019s at least visually distinct, unlike the rest of the characters who are simply wearing\u2026 clothes. Dressing up as a child if you\u2019re an adult is a bit weird, if you ask me.\n\n14. Mouse\n\nI can\u2019t for the life of me think why this would be a Halloween trend in 2019. Has there been some viral meme that\u2019s passed me by?\n\nPresumably not, given I spend every waking second of my life on the internet\u2026 so why?\n\nWhatever the reason, this is simply not a very good Halloween costume. It\u2019s not sexy, scary, or funny\u2026 it\u2019s nothing. And if you go dressed up as Minnie or Mickey, you risk the Disney corporation sending their henchman after you to slap you with a \u2018cease and desist\u2019, which might put a dampener on your evening.\n\n15. Harley Quinn\n\nHarley Quinn is a villain of sorts who first rose to prominence played by Margot Robbie in 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad.\n\nThe thought of someone doing a Harley Quinn costume with their boyfriend dressed as Jared Leto\u2019s Joker is enough to chill my blood. It\u2019s the couples costume for the kind of people who\u2019d describe themselves as being \u2018always one of the weird kids\u2019. Scary\u2026 but not in a good way.\n\nIf none of these float your boat, \u2018Rebecca Vardy\u2019s Instagram account\u2019 is a sure-fire banter option. Alternatively, you could print out Colleen Rooney\u2019s notes-app announcement and simply cellotape it to your face \u2013 laughter guaranteed!\n\nMORE: Mum crochets incredibly detailed Halloween costumes for her four sons\n\nMORE: Quiz: What should you dress up as for Halloween?\n\nMORE: An American Horror Story themed Halloween party is coming to London\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A review of the most Googled Halloween costumes of 2019, including Stranger Things, Harley Quinn, Chucky, Fortnite, and Descendants", "authors": ["James Greig"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89568807_1571142405.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
