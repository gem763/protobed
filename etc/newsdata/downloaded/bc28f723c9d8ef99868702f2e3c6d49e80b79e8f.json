REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez\n\nThe three airlines had said in November 2018 they would file for U.S. antitrust approval \u201cin the near term\u201d in order to coordinate routes between South America and the United States, a bold move to expand their market share in the region. At the time, the carriers said they aimed to implement the agreements in 2020.\n\nUnited said last week it wants to include Azul, in which it already has a stake, in the planned tie-up with Copa and Avianca, the latest play by a U.S. carrier for a region expected to have significant air-travel growth in coming decades.\n\nBut almost a year after United, Copa and Avianca announced the preliminary joint venture plan, they have yet to file any paperwork with the U.S. Department of Transportation, seeking antitrust immunity. Now, the regulatory process may begin as late as next year.\n\nCopa\u2019s CEO, Pedro Heilbron, said the group expects to file in early 2020, while Avianca\u2019s CEO, Anko van der Werff, said it would file between late 2019 and early 2020. Both spoke to Reuters in separate interviews on Monday on the sidelines of the ALTA Airline Leaders\u2019 Forum in Brasilia.\n\nBoth said there was a delay on the original timeline.\n\nUnited did not respond to a request for comment. Azul had no comment other than saying it was \u201calways looking for opportunities with its partners.\u201d\n\nThe potential inclusion of Azul, which may be in the early stages of negotiations, has been one reason for the timetable slipping.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, really completely open and honest, we haven\u2019t had many discussions,\u201d van der Werff said. \u201cI personally haven\u2019t had even one real, serious discussion at the CEO level about when to include [Azul] and what to include.\u201d\n\nBoth executives said they want Azul to be part of the joint venture - Brazil is by far the largest aviation market in the region - but its inclusion makes negotiations more difficult.\n\n\u201cIt almost doubles the level of complexity,\u201d Heilbron said.\n\nAvianca has also gone through corporate turmoil. In May, United Airlines ousted the chairman and controlling shareholder at Avianca, revamping leadership.\n\n\u201cWe should have filed with regulators this year but everything got delayed because of what has happened at Avianca,\u201d Heilbron added.", "description": "A proposed joint venture between United Airlines , Colombia's Avianca Holdings and Panama's Copa Holdings has been delayed due to the potential inclusion of Brazil's Azul SA as a fourth partner, as well as problems at Avianca, the CEOs of two of the companies said.", "authors": ["Marcelo Rochabrun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445991623&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1NG", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
