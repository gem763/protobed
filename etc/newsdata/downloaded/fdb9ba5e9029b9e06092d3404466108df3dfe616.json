Penny Stephens\n\nDid we mention Sexton is the South Australia and Northern Territory president of the governance-focused Australian Institute of Company Directors? Outstanding.\n\nWhen Beston (the ASX-listed company) was set up, the idea was that it would operate as an asset management company. So it has an arrangement with Beston Pacific Asset Management, 71 per cent owned by Sexton and family, to act as its investment manager.\n\nThese days, though, Beston's main business is itself producing tonnes and tonnes of mozzarella.
