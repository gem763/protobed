It turned out after review that he had erred in not allowing one of the goals to stand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that he was nominated, but the [referees] committee felt that his performance on September 24 didn\u2019t make the fact that he was recommended enough. I can confirm that his nomination has been withdrawn,\u201d Masikhwa told City Press yesterday.\n\nThe referees committee confirmed on Friday that Van Wyk had been \u201csanctioned to four weeks of non-appointment in NSL matches\u201d, alongside assistant referee Athuxolo Madela, who made some dubious decisions during the Chiefs versus Baroka league match on September 28.\n\nMasikhwa said the pair would be monitored by technical instructors, who would later send a comprehensive report on their progress.\n\n\u201cThey are sanctioned and are required to do regional matches as part of the rehabilitation process,\u201d he said, adding that the five who were suspended last season were being reintegrated into the system.\n\nHe confirmed that \u201caction\u201d had also been taken against another assistant referee, Shaun Oliver, who denied Khama Billiat a legitimate goal in Chiefs\u2019 league game against Cape Town City in August.\n\nThis week, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane became the latest to lash out at erratic match officials after he claimed his side was denied a penalty in their game against Black Leopards on Tuesday. He commented live on TV in a post-match interview that Chiefs were \u201cbenefiting from the mistakes of the referees\u201d.\n\nAsked what the referees committee made of these remarks, Masikhwa said: \u201cWe usually leave that to the PSL to address such issues ... if the comment by the coach is in transgression of the club\u2019s compliance manual or not.\u201d\n\nVAR will reduce the mistakes by the referees and the teams will benefit Mamelodi Sundown coach, Pitso Mosimane\n\nMosimane is among those calling for the introduction of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in the local game.\n\n\u201cOur World Cup stadiums comply, why not? We have the capacity. The VAR will reduce the mistakes by the referees and the teams will benefit.\u201d\n\nMasikhwa said the local referees\u2019 body was also keen to have the VAR in line with the world\u2019s top leagues.\n\nHe said former PSL referee Jerome Damon, who is now an instructor at Fifa, would lead the process of training the local match officials on the VAR.\n\n\u201cThis is not something that Safa can do alone, we need the buy-in from the PSL as well,\u201d he said.\n\nMasikhwa acknowledged that South Africa might have the resources for the VAR, but the country would still need more personnel to run the process. Safa currently has 90 match officials on its panel.\n\nMasikhwa said only two local match officials \u2013 referee Victor Gomes and assistant referee Zakhele Siwela \u2013 had undergone VAR training.\n\nThe two attended a course in Cairo, Egypt, late last year. Siwela had already acquired extensive training prior to last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia, where he was the only South African on the list to officiate at the global showpiece.\n\nThe VAR system was introduced in top-flight European football by the German Bundesliga and the Serie A in Italy at the start of the 2017/18 season.\n\nThe La Liga in Spain followed suit last season, while the English Premier League implemented the technology at the beginning of this campaign.", "description": "A series of blunders during the recent Absa Premiership fixture between AmaZulu and Kaizer Chiefs has cost PSL assistant referee Mervyn van Wyk his place on the Fifa referees panel.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowage"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9320/3c9dadac64bd4d728d4c8f8df85f0a1d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
