With the emotion of the game at that time, it might seem worse than it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He [Choudhury] was just trying to get back into position. Mo cut across him and there\u2019s a collision. He\u2019s an honest boy.\n\n\u2018He makes challenges, he\u2019s aggressive but I don\u2019t think there was anything malicious in it at all.\u2019\n\nLiverpool appeared to be set to drop points for the first time in the Premier League this season when James Maddison cancelled out Sadio Mane\u2019s first-half opener at Anfield.\n\nBut Mane won a stoppage-time penalty and James Milner held his nerve to convert from the spot as Champions League holders Liverpool clinched another win.\n\nKlopp said after the match: \u2018It was a super game. We upped the tempo. The football we played was so important. Leicester\u2019s goal really stopped us but then we wanted to go forwards.\n\n\u2018The penalty was obviously a penalty. We knew it would probably happen, we knew we were going to fight for the win \u2013 and we did.\n\n\u2018Without luck, we cannot win the amount of games we have won, but over the 90 minutes we deserved it \u2013 we deserved the three points.\u2019\n\nMORE: Tyson Fury speaks out on WWE brawl and sends warning to Braun Strowman", "description": "Brendan Rodgers has defended Hamza Choudhury after Jurgen Klopp blasted the Leicester star following Liverpool's dramatic Premier League win at Anfield.
