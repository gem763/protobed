But Lioness\u2019 CEO says the apology doesn\u2019t go far enough, and it doesn\u2019t signal to her that Samsung will actually make changes to be more inclusive.\n\nAt the event last Thursday, a senior director at Samsung requested that Lioness CEO and co-founder Liz Klinger remove her product, the Lioness Vibrator, from display. Klinger had been invited to the event, approved to attend, and already set up her booth on the show floor.\n\nThe show was supposed to have a focus on women\u2019s health. \u201cSamsung\u2019s okay with women\u2019s health when it\u2019s about fertility and when it\u2019s about making babies, but they don\u2019t seem to be okay with the other aspects of women\u2019s health,\u201d Klinger said. The Next Web first highlighted Samsung\u2019s actions at the event.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t [have a discussion], this same thing\u2019s gonna be happening year after year.\u201d\n\nRather than take down her product, Klinger protested the decision and tweeted about what was happening. By the time she finally got a response from the Samsung director who\u2019d requested her product\u2019s removal, the event was nearly over. That meant the vibrator remained on display, but Klinger wasn\u2019t present at her booth to discuss it.\n\nNow, nearly a week later, Samsung issued a statement to The Verge saying that it regrets what happened and will learn from the encounter.\n\nSamsung is proud to support both women in technology and the future of wearable innovation. This was an event organized by women for women, and men allies who are interested in developing wearable solutions for women. We regret an interaction that occurred with a presenting startup and apologize to those involved. We have addressed this internally and will learn from this as we continue to sponsor female innovators.\n\nKlinger says that Samsung did not reach out to her directly to apologize and that she only saw the statement when it was sent to her by The Verge.\n\nThe apology also, she says, doesn\u2019t amount to much. \u201cIf you translate the statement, especially given the lack of any concrete steps or outreach at all, it basically says they don\u2019t intend to change anything and this is just intended to dismiss what occurred, which is disappointing,\u201d Klinger said.\n\nSamsung and other large tech companies that operate industry events and consumer platforms have \u201cenormous power\u201d to choose who is and isn\u2019t included in cultural conversations, Klinger says, and that has often ended up hurting women-focused sexual health companies.\n\nBased on this statement, it seems like they would still exclude these voices. We\u2019re a small, women-led team. Despite their secondhand apology, if you take into account that they haven\u2019t reached out to us, does it seem likely we or any other company in female sexual wellness will ever be included in their events again? Or (not to be too cynical about it), did they simply learn to exclude/filter these companies ahead of time? What we\u2019d hope for isn\u2019t anything huge, just a basic commitment of greater inclusion and concrete steps to achieve it.\n\nKlinger\u2019s experience follows a similar one from fellow women\u2019s sex toy company Lora DiCarlo. In January, Lora DiCarlo was approved to attend the Consumer Electronics Show and was selected for an Innovation Award for its robotic massager, before later having both revoked. The ensuing criticism led the show\u2019s operator to reinstate the award months later and announce changes that would allow similar sex toys to appear at next year\u2019s show.\n\nSex toy companies face a host of issues that other sexual health companies do not, and it\u2019s had an outsized impact on women-focused products. Services like Hims and Roman are able to widely advertise their erectile disfunction drug services with cheeky ads, while women\u2019s sex toy companies like Dame often find that their ads are rejected from websites and major billboard partners. Facebook, for instance, has a hard rule against advertising sex toys, making it difficult for these companies to get their name out.\n\nI am at the @Samsung event with #womenintechSF for @LionessHealth and was just asked to take down my table. Was approved beforehand, one person was not ok with it because it\u2019s women\u2019s *sexual* health.\n\n\n\nThis is not ok.@cindygallop @womenofsextech #femtech #sextech \u2014 Liz Klinger (@ThisIsKlinger) August 23, 2019\n\nLioness\u2019 product, which has been on sale for two years now, has a built-in gyroscope, accelerometer, force sensor, and temperature sensor to track a user\u2019s body and movements over time. That data is then visualized in an app for users to assess.\n\nKlinger has had experiences being rejected because of her company\u2019s focus in the past \u2014 she said Lioness had trouble just opening a bank account \u2014 but it was new to be turned down by an event she was already present at.\n\nKlinger wants Samsung and similar companies to \u201cstart being more inclusive\u201d\n\nThe event, which was co-hosted by Samsung and SF Women in Tech, included a number of other women\u2019s health companies, including Glow, which makes a fertility app. Bloomlife, which makes a contraction tracker, and Mira, another fertility app company, were also invited to attend.\n\nKlinger says she wants \u201cSamsung and similar organizations to start being more inclusive about the idea of women\u2019s health and women in technology.\u201d Too often, she says, large companies\u2019 commitment to diversity and inclusion feels like lip service.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to have a discussion,\u201d Klinger said. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t, this same thing\u2019s gonna be happening year after year.\u201d", "description": "Samsung says it was wrong to have asked the CEO of Lioness, a smart sex toy company, to hide her product at a women\u2019s tech event it was co-hosting.
