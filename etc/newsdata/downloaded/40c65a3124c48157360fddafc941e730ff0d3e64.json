We're not the closest of friends but are in the same circle.\n\n\"She's a lovely girl, has a lovely family and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s just done this overnight, this is something she's investigated over a long period of time.\n\n\"It's a small circle of friends that you've got as it is so to find out it's someone on your personal social media, someone you're supposed to trust, it must be hard.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDefending her decision to post the finding online for the public to see, Chantelle said \"good for her\".\n\nShe said: \"I think her whole life is played out in public as it is, she\u2019s a private person and I think enough is enough.\n\n\"When you find out it's come from this account, it might not have been her first hand, but I don't know... I feel like good for you, why not.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nSpeaking of her own experience, she added: \"So when I first started dating my husband things that only my friends and family knew, they'd pop up in the newspapers.\n\n\"I was questioning own mum, my grandma... it was not a nice place to be in and I feel for her.\"\n\nThe drama kicked off on Wednesday, when Coleen told her followers: \"\u201cAfter a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account.\n\n\u201cOver the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\u201cThe story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u201dNow I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from. It\u2019s Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nRebekah later hit back, and told Coleen in a furious post online: \u201cAs I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\u201cI never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for. If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cOver the years various people have had access to my Insta. I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u201d\n\nRebekah\u2019s legal team have launched a forensic IT investigation to try to prove her innocence.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "Coleen Rooney's decision to accuse Rebekah Vardy of leaking stories about her on Twitter has sparked debate", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Getty Images", "Itv", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17387853.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Slovakia-v-England-Group-B-UEFA-Euro-2016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
