It was in the bedroom, in the kitchen \u2013 it was everywhere. I had no idea that ink could go that far!\u2019\n\nIn a hilarious video, Angela surveys the scene as Brandy prances around from room to room showing off the mess he\u2019s made.\n\nNot only did the dog\u2019s inky pawprints cover Angela\u2019s kitchen floor, they also stained her sofa \u2013 and are proving incredibly hard to clean.\n\n\u2018The kitchen was easy, but the sofa looks like it has been attacked,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or get him re-homed! At first I thought it was soil \u2013 then it clicked and I thought \u201cright, get the bleach\u201d.\u2019\n\nThe hardest thing to clean, however, has been Brandy himself.\n\nAngela said: \u2018His paws were dyed blue! We are three or four baths in now, and his fur is still stained. He has to go to the dog groomer to have his hair cut and cleaned.\u2019\n\nA very guilty looking Brandy (Picture: SWNS)\n\nShe has only had him for six months, but Brandy is already gaining a reputation for mischief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My 19-year-old daughter who lives down south calls him Ginger Nut, because he\u2019s so mad. She always rings up and asks what he\u2019s done now,\u2019 Angela said.\n\nDespite the destruction, she is anything but angry with Brandy. I mean come on, look at that little face.\n\nAngela added: \u2018It is what it is. It\u2019s part and parcel of owning a dog. He\u2019s like a toddler, he\u2019s just learning. For him, it was fantastic fun.\n\n\u2018He can be naughty, but no of course we can\u2019t stay angry at him. He\u2019s only a puppy \u2013 he\u2019s only a baby!\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum hails \u00a39.99 sleep spray as \u2018magic\u2019 for helping her baby sleep through the night\n\nMORE: Couple have three foot tall Disney themed cake at their wedding\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A dog chewed an ink pen and managed to get pawprints all over the house.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90005275_1571156064.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
