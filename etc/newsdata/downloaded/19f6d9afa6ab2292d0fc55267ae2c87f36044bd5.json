They dropped two at Hibs last weekend and the loss of three more on a sticky leveller of a surface was a damaging way to enter the international break.\n\nFor the second week in succession Rangers started a home game with the bit firmly between their teeth, the aroma of blood in their nostrils.\n\nScott Robinson scored the game's opening goal just two minutes into the opening half\n\nRyan Christie caught Livingston's Scott Robinson with a horrific challenge in the first half\n\nChristie was sent off leaving Celtic battling with just ten men for the majority of the game\n\nMATCH FACTS Livingston (4-1-4-1): : Sarkic, Devlin, Guthrie, Lamie, McMillan, Bartley, Jacobs, Crawford, Lawless (Odoffin 81), Dykes (Miller 87), Robinson (Lawson 76) Substitutes not used: Stewart, Sibbald, Pepe, Souda Manager: Gary Holt Booked: Robinson, Lamie, Jacobs Celtic (4-2-3-1):: Forster, Bauer, Jullien, Ajer, Bolingoli-Mbombo (Hayes 73), Brown (Ntcham 74), McGregor, Forrest (Bayo 54), Christie, Elyounoussi, Edouard Substitutes not used: Gordon, Bitton, Sinclair, Elhamed Manager: Neil Lennon Booked: Jullien, Ajer Sent off: Christie Referee:William Collum Attendance: 8196\n\nRestricted to a 0-0 draw at the same venue last season attempts to fight fire with fire backfired when Ryan Christie's horrible challenge left Neil Lennon's side playing with 10 men for over an hour.\n\nThe game was 25 minutes old, going nowhere fast, when the Scotland midfielder lunged into a studs-raised, straight legged challenge on match-winner Scott Robinson close to the halfway line.\n\nA clear case of endangering an opponent Christie had to go, referee Willie Collum producing an immediate red card.\n\nThe impact on Celtic was obvious from the stats.\n\nIn 19 games this season Lennon's side had scored in every one, Christie involved in some capacity in 36 per cent of them.\n\nA goal down at Easter Road last weekend it was the former Inverness man who claimed the leveller.\n\nThere was no comeback this time. Dragged into a physical headlock by opponents with a fraction of the wage bill, the Parkhead side could have no argument with the red card.\n\nNor with the outcome; Livingston's first win over the champions since their inception in 1995.\n\nThe first time Celtic had failed to score in a match since May 12, it was a second straight visit to the same venue without breaching Livingston's goal. The word 'dogged' was almost created for Gary Holt's side and their defending here was heroic at times.\n\nThe sponsors' man of the match was Nicky Devlin, yet they could have picked any player in a yellow jersey. In contrast Celtic were awful, the pitch no excuse for the paucity of their performance or for Christie's actions.\n\nNarrow winners over Hamilton on a similar surface were uncomfortable with their surroundings from the start. Playing with 10 men for two thirds of the match certainly didn't help.\n\nCeltic still dominated possession but struggled to find a way back into the game with ten men\n\nThere was retribution from Scott Robinson when he slotted his side into the lead three minutes into the second half with a fine goal.\n\nLyndon Dykes, an increasingly impressive performer at this level, killed the game stone dead with a route one, ridiculously easy goal after 73 minutes.\n\nWhere Livingston's defending was relentless, Celtic's was porous.\n\nYet to lose to Celtic as Livingston boss Holt made four changes to the team beaten 2-1 by Hamilton last weekend and was rewarded by a repeat of the performance which made life difficult for Rangers in the recent Betfred League Cup quarter-final defeat.\n\nThe Almondvale side have none of the budget or the resources of bigger clubs in the Premiership.\n\nBut they have spirit, they have organisation and they have a pitch anyone who loves and cherishes football really should detest. The combination of the three goes a long way.\n\nEven with Christie on the pitch Celtic found space and opportunities hard to come by.\n\nLyndon Dykes scored Livingston's second goal after chipping the ball over Fraser Forster\n\nOdsonne Edouard ran into blind alleys as a yellow shirt whacked the ball high into the sky to safety.\n\nThe Frenchman managed to work a decent one two with James Forrest eight minutes before the latter poked wide.\n\nWhen Christopher Jullien burst forward with the ball at his feet 10 minutes later, the striker gathered the ball and had one thing in mind.\n\nA driven right foot shot pushed wide by Matija Sarkic, the Livingston keeper called in to replace young Ross Stewart after the defeat to Hamilton.\n\nLivingston were never cowed nor intimidated. Jon Guthrie slotted a low shot wide of the post, before Lawless deftly worked a free-kick which ended in a low drive being gathered by Forster low at his left hand post.\n\nThe result means that Neil Lennon's side dropped to second in the league as Rangers won\n\nThe red card merely added to the unease of the away support. The sense that Celtic were in trouble.\n\nThe confirmation arrived in the 48th minute when Livingston claimed the opening goal.\n\nKristoffer Ajer lost possession in the middle of the pitch, placing the visitors under needless pressure.\n\nSteven Lawless gathered on the right touchline and fed former Rangers player Robbie Crawford outside the penalty area.\n\nTime \u2013 and Moritz Bauer \u2013 seemed to stand still as Robinson raced into space to thump a deft through ball into the net to the delight of the sparse home support\n\nNeil Lennon's response was to go for broke. Forrest was withdrawn, Vakoun Bayo thrown on as \u2013 unusually \u2013 the Parkhead side went with two strikers.\n\nLivingston manager Gary Holt celebrated the club's famous first ever victory over Celtic\n\nThe pressure built and threatened to pay off when Elyounoussi danced his way in from left and thumped a low strike at goal.\n\nSaved by Sarkic, Livingston thumped the ball to safety as the away support sensed something in the air. They reckoned without Livingston's swarming, organised resilience. The home team denied the champions a goal in a 0-0 draw at the same venue last season. As the game entered the final stages lightning threatened to strike twice.\n\nThe replacement of Boli Bolingolo with Jonny Hayes failed to have the desired effect.\n\nCeltic's defending for Livingston's second and decisive goal was abysmal. A meat and drink route one free kick from keeper Matija Sarkic straight down the middle found Lyndon Dykes running off a ponderous Jullien to lob the ball off the underside of the bar for 2-0.\n\nWith 17 minutes to play and 10 men, Celtic had no way back. For Rangers it was almost too good to be true.", "description": "Celtic suffered their first league defeat in their opening eight games.
