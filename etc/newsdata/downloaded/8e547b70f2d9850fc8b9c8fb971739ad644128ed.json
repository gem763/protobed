Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\u201d Trump said. \u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\"\n\nHe capped off his complaint by declaring: \u201cPresidential Harassment!\u201d\n\nThe Post reported that a U.S. intelligence official filed the formal complaint in regard to Trump\u2019s communications with the unnamed foreign leader.\n\nNORTH KOREA'S KIM INVITES TRUMP TO PYONGYANG\n\nThe complaint, in turn, has triggered a showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers.\n\nThose lawmakers pressed intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson for details during Thursday\u2019s closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. The Associated Press reported, though, that he would not discuss the substance of the complaint.\n\nAfter the testimony, Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage.\n\n\"What\u2019s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,\" he said.\n\nSchiff also released letters from the inspector general that revealed the watchdog considered the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d and dealing with an \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nThe letters revealed the office is now \u201cat an impasse\u201d with the director of national intelligence over disclosure. Atkinson wrote that the DNI, \u201cafter consulting with the Department of Justice,\u201d determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will \u201cabide by that determination,\u201d but disagrees with it.\n\nSchiff earlier told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \"at least according to the director of national intelligence, this involves an issue of privileged communications,\u201d adding, \"I think it's fair to assume this involves either the president or people around him or both.\"\n\nHe added that if the \u201cdirector of national intelligence is going to undermine the whistleblower protections, it means that people are going to end up taking the law into their own hands and going directly to the press instead of the mechanism that Congress set to protect classified information.\u201d\n\nSchiff subpoenaed Maguire, saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of \"urgent concern.\" He said the complaint \"concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.\"\n\nSchiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back \"raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.\n\nFox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge and Matt Leach and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A whistleblower complaint that reportedly involved allegations President Trump made a troubling and unspecified \"promise\" to a foreign leader touched off a new Washington firestorm on Thursday, as the intelligence community\u2019s top watchdog was questioned by Congress on the matter and the president adamantly denied the accusations.", "authors": ["Judson Berger"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/18/694940094001_6087531248001_6087530714001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
