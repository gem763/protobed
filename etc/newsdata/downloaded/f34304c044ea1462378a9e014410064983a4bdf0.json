REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/File Photo\n\nThe natural gas rich Gulf state, with a population of just over 2.6 million, has used its financial clout to land some of the sporting world\u2019s biggest events, including the athletics world championships currently underway in Doha and the 2022 soccer World Cup.\n\nDoha hosted the 2006 Asian Games, which were widely considered a success, and used them as stepping stone to pursue bigger sporting prizes, including an unsuccessful bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\u201cQatar is thinking about it, seriously thinking about it,\u201d the QOC official told Reuters. \u201cOur people are ready and thinking about it but nothing has officially happened yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoha is not yet an applicant city.\u201d\n\nHe said a firmer decision would likely be made at the next International Olympic Committee (IOC) Congress.\n\nThe next IOC session is scheduled for Jan. 10-11 next year.\n\nDecisions by some of the world\u2019s biggest sports to bring their showcase events to Qatar have often been clouded in scandal and controversy.\n\nAllegations of bribery, corruption and human rights violations hung over the bids for the 2022 soccer World Cup and 2019 world athletics championships.\n\nQatar has demonstrated a huge appetite for hosting the world\u2019s biggest sporting parties, part of a national development strategy that aims to build a sports industry and diversify its energy-based economy.\n\nThe athletics world championships being held in Doha this week have been heavily criticised for sparse attendance while the searing heat has forced the road events to be run at midnight to avoid the worst of the extreme conditions.\n\nDespite the criticism the QOC is set on continuing to increase Qatar\u2019s sporting footprint.\n\n\u201cThis falls under our belief about the importance of sports and gathering the world together for them, and it is part of our vision for the Qatar 2030 development strategy,\u201d said the official.", "description": "Qatar is considering a bid for the 2030 Asian Games but has not formally thrown its hat in the ring, a Qatar Olympic Association (QOC) official told Reuters on Monday, its latest effort to establish Doha as a major sports capital.", "authors": ["Eric Knecht", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435662403&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T19G", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
