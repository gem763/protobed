South China Morning Post/ Nora Tam\n\nTop bosses at Hong Kong\u2019s rail operator has said the company is \u201cexperiencing the most tremendous challenges\u201d in its 40-year history.\n\nThe civil unrest sweeping the city has turned MTR stations into flashpoints for clashes between police and protesters in recent weeks.\n\nIn an open letter to passengers on Sunday, the MTR Corporation\u2019s chairman, Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen, and CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui, condemned \u201call violence\u201d and said they \u201cdeeply regret\u201d the vandalism at stations. Their letter also praised the company\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cFacing this challenging situation, MTR colleagues have been making their best endeavour to recover and repair facilities in a timely manner to minimise the impacts on passengers,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe express our deepest gratitude to all colleagues who have spared no effort in their work and provided a safe railway service impartially.\u201d\n\nThey stressed that the corporation was a \u201chome grown Hong Kong public transport operator\u201d and urged \u201call sectors of the community [to] treasure and safeguard this railway network, which has been carrying our collective memories over the past few decades\u201d.\n\nIn an apparent appeal to the protesters, the letter read: \u201cPlease allow us to honour our commitment and continue to provide our fellow citizens with safe and reliable railway service.\u201d\n\nBut, the appeal appeared to have fallen on deaf ears as more chaos descended on stations on Sunday, as protesters again vandalised stations after what had been largely a peaceful march in Central.\n\nA group barricaded and set fires outside several entrances of Central station, while some also smashed up glass partitions, turnstiles, and television screens at Wan Chai station as they marched towards Causeway Bay, in what appeared to be an impromptu protest.\n\nMTR Corp has become a target of attacks by anti-government protesters in recent months. At first, they vandalised the station facilities and removed equipment to block police from chasing them into the station.\n\nCrowds also besieged stations and harassed staff, blaming them for allowing police to get into the stations to catch protesters.\n\nThe pleas from Hong Kong MTR bosses appeared to have fallen on deaf ears after protesters lit fires outside Central station. SCMP/Dickson Lee\n\nThe rail operator was granted a court injunction on August 23, that sought to restrain anyone from unlawfully and wilfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use and operation of the railway.\n\nIt also bans any action of damaging any station property, or behaving in a riotous or disorderly manner.\n\nAny person who neglects to obey or comply with the injunction order may be held in contempt of court and may be jailed or fined. But the vandalism has not stopped.\n\nOn August 31, five of the rail lines were eventually forced to suspend services as multiple MTR stations along the Island, Tsuen Wan, and Kwun Tong lines were attacked.\n\nOver the past week, Prince Edward station has become a key protest site. On August 31, police stormed the platform of the station and used pepper spray, made multiple arrests, and left several people injured after hitting them with their batons.\n\nProtesters want the MTR Corp to make the surveillance camera tapes at the station public to \u201cdisclose the truth\u201d.\n\nMote than 40 stations on the city\u2019s 11 lines have been damaged during protests over past few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe MTR management has been too weak in dealing with protesters,\u201d said Luk Chung-hung, the deputy chairman of the Legislative Council subcommittee on railways.\n\n\u201cIt has been granted an injunction, it should ask bailiffs to be sent to help stop protesters. Just issuing a letter condemning violence is far from enough.\u201d\n\nLuk, of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, also called for better training and protective gear to be provided to frontline station staff.\n\nSOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It was peaceful.
