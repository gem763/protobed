But even the best store credit cards tend to have a few big drawbacks: APRs are often considerably higher than their general-purpose counterparts and credit limits tend to be lower, sometimes as little as a few hundred dollars.\n\nIllustration by Tim Boelaars More\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to build or rebuild your credit with a retail card, this can be a double-edged sword, since using the card to charge even a moderate amount could result in a credit utilization ratio that is too high, which can actually drag down your credit score. Furthermore, many store cards can\u2019t be used outside of that chain or its corporate family of brands.\n\nMore so than for other credit card categories, the quote-unquote best store credit card is going to vary greatly depending on where and how you spend. If you renovate and flip homes, an Ikea credit card might make sense for you \u2014 whereas if you\u2019re just looking to buy a dresser and some throw pillows, a potential drag on your credit score might outweigh any benefits. Rewards, too, are likely to be tied to that retailer, so if you don\u2019t shop there regularly, you might not be maximizing the value a store credit card could give you.\n\nDespite store cards\u2019 shortcomings MONEY found a few standouts in this category. We evaluated MagnifyMoney\u2019s extensive database of retail cards, looking for ones that give you the most spending flexibility, most generous and versatile rewards, and consumer-friendly terms. While there were a few we liked, we found that one offering easily rose to the top.\n\nIllustration by Tania Guerra More\n\nKey Terms\n\n\u2022Rewards: 5% cash back for Amazon.com and Whole Foods purchases; 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores; 1% cash back elsewhere\n\n\u2022Annual Fee: $0, but an Amazon Prime membership, which costs $119 annually, is required\n\n\u2022APR: 16.24%-24.24%\n\nWhy You Should Get It\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about this Amazon-branded Visa. Even though you can pretty much buy anything on Amazon, you\u2019re not limited to its retail ecosystem (although rewards are most generous for Amazon-related spending). If you already have an Amazon Prime membership, it\u2019s basically like having a no-annual-fee card. The APR range is more or less in line with many of the general-purpose rewards cards we\u2019ve seen out there. If you spend $5,000 a year on Amazon.com, that\u2019s $250 in rewards \u2014 and that\u2019s not even counting rewards you earn for purchases outside of Amazon. We also appreciate the inclusion of drugstores in the card\u2019s 2% accelerated-earnings category; medication costs are a growing concern for many Americans, so being able to recoup even a small fraction of that spending is helpful. Finally, although this isn\u2019t a travel card, it has a couple of travel-friendly perks like 2% back at restaurants and gas stations, and no foreign transaction fees.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Store cards often come with drawbacks, but there are a few real standouts.", "authors": ["Martha C.
