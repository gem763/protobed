That right now is not Turkish controlled territory.\" (Reporting by Phil Stewart, Makini Brice and David Brunnstrom; editing by Grant McCool)", "description": "The United States struck a ceasefire agreement with Turkey on Thursday that will halt the fighting in exchange for a retreat by Kurdish YPG militia from a \"safe zone\" area in part because the U.S. believed the Kurds would not be able to hold that area militarily anyway, a top U.S. official", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
