Protesters have also vandalised the offices of some ruling-party lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe accept democratic debate, that people might disagree with out policies, but this goes too far,\u201d the aide said.\n\nHe said the first letter was sent to police in the Basque country city of Bayonne in August, threatening to \u201cpulverise\u201d Le Maire\u2019s summer holiday house during the Aug. 24-27 G7 summit, hosted by France\u2019s president in nearby Biarritz.\n\nThe second was sent direct to Le Maire\u2019s residence in Saint-Pee-sur-Nivelle, this time threatening to target the minister himself.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance received a third letter containing three bullets on Tuesday.
