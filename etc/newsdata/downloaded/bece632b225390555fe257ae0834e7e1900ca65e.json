The whole-body exoskeleton, which is part of a two-year trial by Clinatec and the University of Grenoble, is operated by recording and decoding brain signals.\n\nAs part of the trial, Thibault had surgery to place two implants on the surface of the brain, covering the parts that control movement. Sixty-four electrodes on each implant read his brain activity and beam the instructions to a computer.\n\nFrench tetraplegic \u2018Thibault\u2019 as he stands while wearing an exo-skeleton at Clinatec laboratory at the University of Grenoble. (AFP)\n\nThese are the first steps he has taken since 2015 (AFP)\n\nSoftware then reads the brainwaves and turns them into instructions to control the exoskeleton.\n\n\u2018It was like (being the) first man on the Moon. I didn\u2019t walk for two years. I forgot what it is to stand, I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room,\u2019 he said after successfully using the exoskeleton.\n\nA previous patient recruited to the study had to be excluded because a technical problem prevented the brain implants communicating with the algorithm. Professor Alim-Louis Benabid of the University of Grenoble, said the exoskeleton used is the first semi-invasive wireless brain-computer system designed for long term use to activate all four limbs.\n\n\u2018Previous brain-computer studies have used more invasive recording devices implanted beneath the outermost membrane of the brain, where they eventually stop working,\u2019 he told medical journal The Lancet.\n\nThibault manages to direct the movements of an exoskeleton by thought (AFP)\n\nFrench researchers say this work opens up important perspectives for paraplegics (AFP)\n\nHe said it made him feel like the first man on the moon (AFP)\n\n\u2018They have also been connected to wires, limited to creating movement in just one limb, or have focused on restoring movement to patients\u2019 own muscles.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfesssor Tom Shakespeare, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the exoskeleton is a long way from being a usable clinical possibility.\n\n\u2018A danger of hype always exists in this field. Even if ever workable, cost constraints mean that hi-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury,\u2019 he said.", "description": "Thibault became a tetraplegic in 2015", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88316633_1570186724.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
