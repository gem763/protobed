So it is no surprise that dancers end up falling for each other, training every day in very close proximity.\n\n\"My other thought is the more obvious idea of dancing being quite a sexual activity, so perhaps chemistry is fuelled by that too.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see a few relationships develop out of this year\u2019s line-up \u2013 rehearsals are intense, they involve long hours, lots of discipline and determination.\n\n\"It\u2019s such a unique experience that can see people go through both a mental and physical transformation.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
