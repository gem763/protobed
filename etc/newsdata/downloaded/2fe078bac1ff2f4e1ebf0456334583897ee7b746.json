At the same time, the company's overall fixed line footprint shrunk by 6,000 connections as it continues to switch off legacy areas.\n\nNew Zealand broadband users are now going through 360GB of data per month, on average, with the wholesaler seeing a new peak of 2.5Tbps during the recent Australia versus Wales group match at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Former NBN chief strategy officer moves to Kiwi broadband wholesaler.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/04/59c7aeba-dd5c-4529-a8d7-afc5f9ea329c/thumbnail/770x578/8dc4ef3903027331c3e1c2edfe10aecb/new-zealand-flag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
