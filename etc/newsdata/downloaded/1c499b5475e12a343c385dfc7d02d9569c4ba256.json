Bertrand Perez, executive director of the Libra Association, revealed his intentions for Libra\u2019s launch to French news magazine Les Echos in an interview released yesterday. A spokeswoman from Libra also confirmed the plans to Decrypt.\n\nLibra, which was announced back in June, always planned to be released in the first half of 2020. But Libra has faced immense criticism from regulators, who believe that the Libra Association, a small group of rich companies including Uber and PayPal, is an attempt to create a \u201cshadow bank\u201d that usurps the authority of state-run central banks.\n\nJust yesterday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Libra\u2019s \u201cprivatization of money contains risks of abuse of dominant position, risks to sovereignty and risks for consumers and for companies.\" He went so far as to say that the OECD \u201ccannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.\"\n\nLibra has made efforts to cooperate with regulators. Earlier this week, Libra asked a Swiss regulator for clarity about what sort of regulation it wanted and expressed intentions to apply for a payments license. In response to a statement by top privacy regulators last month, which claimed that Libra didn\u2019t sufficiently explain how it planned to protect user data, Libra has delivered some of the documents, which are currently under review.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Regulators have other plans", "authors": ["Robert Stevens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aFTNGPsPQYHfcu8ZoR2tcA--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/beef696fde33ad2da3c113157d061e96", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
