Brown) faces challenges juggling work and family demands. 20th Century Fox Television\n\nJack Pearson isn't around for his family\u2019s present-day storyline, but his alter ego, actor Milo Ventimiglia, got to check in on wife Rebecca and children Kevin, Kate and Randall when he directed Tuesday\u2019s episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d (9 EDT/PDT).\n\nFor Ventimiglia, whose character died in 1998 when his children were in their teens, Tuesday's episode provided a connection to cast members he doesn\u2019t act with on the timeline-shifting series, including Sterling K. Brown, Justin Hartley and Chrissy Metz, who play Jack's children as adults.\n\n\"I knew that I was walking on set, not as No. 1 on the call sheet (but) as someone who had never directed on the show before,\" he says. \"When I walked onto set with (them), , I was a guest.\"\n\nThe episode, \"Storybook Love,\" contrasts meals nearly two decades apart: the first dinner Jack and his pregnant wife, Rebecca (Mandy Moore), share in their new house and the first family gathering a faltering Rebecca hosts in her new home a year after Jack's death in 1998.\n\nMore: Milo Ventimiglia celebrates Jack's life on 'This Is Us'\n\nMilo Ventimiglia, who plays Jack Pearson in NBC's 'This Is Us,' directs Hannah Zeile, who plays teenage Kate Pearson, before the filming of a family dinner scene in the Season 4 episode, 'Storybook Love.'

Kevin (Hartley) spends a day bonding with his uncle, Nicky (Griffin Dunne), and getting to know war veteran Cassidy (Jennifer Morrison), while Kate (Metz) awaits a baby gift from her brothers.\n\nCreator Dan Fogelman calls the episode, which gives the first inkling of the eventual Rebecca-Miguel (Jon Huertas) relationship and shows a connection slowly forming between Kevin and Nicky, \"one of my favorites,\" and the first of three that mark \"as strong a run of episodes as we've ever had.\"\n\nFogelman says other cast members, including Brown, may direct and even write episodes of the drama, which was renewed for three seasons last spring. (Fogelman, who tweeted \"Halftime\" after April's Season 3 finale, now declines to confirm the show's end after six seasons \u2013 \"I think NBC doesn't love me talking about the exact number.\")\n\nMore: 'This Is Us' recap: Back to the 'Pool,' and back to bad habits\n\nMore: 'This Is Us' Season 4 premiere recap: Meet the 'Strangers'\n\nKevin (Logan Shroyer), clockwise from left, Rebecca (Mandy Moore), Randall (Niles Fitch), Beth (Rachel Wilson) and Kate (Hannah Zeile) share a toast at a family dinner in 'Storybook Love,' an episode of 'This Is Us' directed by fellow cast member Milo Ventimiglia. (Photo: Ron Batzdorff, NBC)\n\n\"Our cast members have varied interests, whether it be directing, producing, writing. What we're hoping to do in the last few seasons of the show is give them the opportunity to scratch those itches and use their talents,\" he says.\n\nVentimiglia, 42, went first, partly because he had few scenes in the previous episode, which allowed him the prep time directors need.\n\nHe shot the Jack-Rebecca scenes in one day, with producer/director (and former actor) Ken Olin on set. Ventimiglia reviewed the scenes, including a battle between Jack and an unwelcome pigeon houseguest, on video playback after each take.\n\nMore: 'This Is Us' finale: The big surprises and burning questions from that startling flash-forward\n\nCassidy (Jennifer Morrison), left, Kevin (Justin Hartley) and Nicky (Griffin Dunne) attend an event honoring veterans in the 'Storybook Love' episode of 'This Is Us' that is directed by actor Milo Ventimiglia. (Photo: Ron Batzdorff, NBC)\n\n\"After my first take, Ken pulled me aside and said: 'Milo, just focus on your acting. You've got everything else ready to go.' And I realized I did all the homework as a director, so I could focus on the acting,\" Ventimiglia says.\n\nEven the tricky pigeon scene? \"It wasn't easy, but it also wasn't difficult. We got pretty lucky with the performance of the bird.\"\n\nBesides Olin, Ventimiglia knew he had the support of a familiar crew, including cinematographer Yasu Tanida, who creates the visual look that creates continuity between episodes helmed by different directors. Casey Johnson and David Windsor, the episode's writers, also helped Ventimiglia navigate a story packed with a complex mix of family details interconnected over time.\n\n\"Casey and Dave are on set, saying, 'Hey, Milo, can you make sure we got a shot of this, because that sets up what's happening three episodes down the line?'\" Ventimiglia says.\n\nVentimiglia's episode is followed by two that \"explore some complicated generational stuff dealing with race (and) class,\" Fogelman says.\n\n'This Is Us' director Milo Ventimiglia, right, discusses a scene with fellow cast member Justin Hartley, who plays Kevin Pearson.

(Another new character, Blake Stadnik's adult (and blind) Jack Damon, also will return this season, Fogelman says.)\n\nVentimiglia says this season also will feature more of Jack and Rebecca before they were parents. Michael Angarano will be back as the younger version of Nicky, and Fogelman teases \"an incredibly deep, almost scary arc\" for Randall.\n\nMore: Michael Angarano can finally talk about the 'This Is Us' Nicky secret\n\nJack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), left, temporarily shores up a dining room table as his pregnant wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore) looks on in the 'Storybook Love' episode of 'This Is Us,' which is directed by Ventimiglia. (Photo: Ron Batzdorff, NBC)\n\nBefore getting too deeply into future stories, however, Fogelman stops to appreciate small but significant moments from Ventimiglia's episode: a sweet kitchen scene in which Miguel (Jon Huertas) bolsters Rebecca as she struggles after Jack's death, and a family ice cream story Nicky shares with Kevin.\n\n\"That is something one of my grandparents used to do with ice cream (and) Milo did such a beautiful job with it,\" he says.\n\nIt may help that Ventimiglia has such intimate knowledge of the characters, as he displays in championing Miguel's support for Rebecca, his future wife, in the kitchen scene.\n\n\"Miguel is a hero. I think people forget that Jack was his best friend. It's not just Rebecca going through pain. Miguel is, too,\" he says. \"I watch the show from almost a studious place where I'm focused on the making of it, the look of it and the feel of it. Aside from acting on the show, I'm a fan.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/21/milo-ventimiglia-this-is-us-spoilers/4024925002/", "description": "Milo Ventimiglia, whose Jack Pearson lives in the past on 'This Is Us,' got to visit the present-day Pearsons when he directed this week's episode.", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published P.M.
