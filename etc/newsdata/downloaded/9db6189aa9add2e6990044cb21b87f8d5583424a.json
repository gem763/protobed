The acting chief scientist at Noaa, Craig McLean, said the agency probably violated its scientific integrity rules by doing so.\n\nIn Washington, Ross faced calls to resign.\n\nIn Huntsville, Alabama, Jacobs, a career meteorologist, appeared near tears at the lectern as he thanked the Birmingham office and mentioned Kevin Laws, a staff leader in the audience.\n\n\u201cThis is hard for me,\u201d said Jacobs, his voice choked.\n\nLaws, science and operations officer with the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Birmingham, said he appreciated the remarks by Jacobs, who he has known for 20 years.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no hard feelings,\u201d Laws said.\n\nSome forecasters had talked about walking out on Jacobs\u2019 speech or staging some sort of protest but there was no demonstration and he received polite applause.\n\nTrump tweeted about Dorian threatening Alabama on 1 September, apparently relying on information that was several days old. Laws said forecasters working in the Birmingham office were having a quiet morning when the phones suddenly lit up.\n\n\u201cWe got calls about people having surgery and should they cancel. We got calls about \u2018Should I go get my elderly parents?\u2019 There were so many concerns,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nThe office then issued a tweet of its own saying Alabama wasn\u2019t at risk. Forecasters didn\u2019t know what had happened, Laws said, until reaction started on social media, where some accused the staff of attempting to embarrass Trump.\n\n\u201cWe realized there was more to this than we first thought,\u201d he said.\n\nJacobs said Dorian presented forecasters with a \u201cparticularly difficult\u201d challenge and noted that early on, \u201cAlabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the south-east\u201d.\n\nJacobs\u2019 remarks came a day after the NWS director, Louis Uccellini, said forecasters in Birmingham did the right thing, aiming to reassure the public. Laws declined to say who sent the tweet that contradicted Trump.\n\n\u201cIt came from all of us,\u201d he said.", "description": "Neil Jacobs said a statement criticizing the Alabama office that disagreed with Trump was meant to clarify \u2018technical aspects\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press In Huntsville"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6806de5a6d3c19829f53fbf00d3a0295a68e8442/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=314b141d34c6cbdb8fca018f2bcb9371", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
