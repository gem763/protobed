Chef Meir Adoni drizzles the sesame paste on his smoked eggplant carpaccio and his branzino, his vegetable couscous and his pan-roasted octopus. Come dessert, it plays a starring role in the tahini cookies, imparting an unforgettable toasty aroma. If a cookie can be said to have a long finish, this one does.\n\nIn taste and texture a cross between peanut-butter cookies and shortbread, tahini cookies have wonderful nuance and some ever-so-slightly bitter notes to balance the sugar. Popular in Mr. Adoni\u2019s native Israel and in other parts of the Middle East, they\u2019ve been popping up stateside thanks in part to delicious recipes in Yotam Ottolenghi \u2019s seminal book \u201cJerusalem\u201d and Michael Solomonov \u2019s vibrant \u201cZahav.\u201d Terrific as both of these recipes are, the cookie at Nur is perhaps the lightest, most delicate and crisp version to date.\n\nTahini cookies are as easy to make as American-style peanut-butter cookies, but be selective when it comes to the marquee ingredient. The better the tahini, the rounder the taste; a lesser product will be pasty and bitter. I use either Soom Foods or Seed + Mill, two widely available artisan brands. Like any seed or nut butter, tahini separates when stored, so before measuring it out for this recipe, reintegrate the oil by giving it a very strong stir or a minute in a food processor or blender.\n\nAt Nur, the dough is rolled in sesame seeds before baking. This adds texture, for those who want it. I happen to love these fragile little treats even more without. After removing them from the oven, let them cool on the pan before transferring them via spatula to a flat serving plate. They won\u2019t stay there long.\n\nTahini Cookies\n\nTOTAL TIME: 25 minutes MAKES: about 24 small cookies\n\n7 tablespoons butter, at room temperature\n\n\u00bd cup white sugar\n\n\u00bd cup tahini\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\u00bd teaspoon baking powder\n\n\u00be cup sesame seeds (optional)\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.\n\n2. Place tahini in a food processor or blender to reintegrate oil and paste if it has separated. Then beat tahini into butter-sugar and mix until fully incorporated.\n\n3. Reduce speed to low and add flour and baking powder. Mix until just combined. Refrigerate dough 15 minutes to make shaping the cookies easier. (The dough may also be refrigerated overnight.)\n\n4. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. If using sesame seeds, place them in a shallow bowl. Roll teaspoon-size pieces of dough in your hands to form balls. Roll cookie dough balls in seeds to completely cover, transferring them to prepared baking sheet as you go. Bake cookies until just golden, 10 minutes.\n\n\u2014Adapted from Nur, New York City", "description": "You only need a few ingredients to make this recipe.
