He has not, however, lacked effort or interest, no matter how low his performances have dipped and you wonder what exactly those home fans who booed the captain as he left the field in the second half were thinking. Certainly Arsenal\u2019s supporters, who pay through the nose, deserve better and are entitled to vent their frustrations. But to single out an underperforming player for abuse is cruel, toxic and patently self-defeating. Xhaka could be seen mouthing a four-letter response and, for once after an Arsenal implosion, the sympathy should be with the player and not the fans.

He scored or created nearly 50% of our goals,\u201d Lampard said. But now Tammy Abraham has been directly involved in nine league goals, Mason Mount and Pulisic in five apiece, Willian in four and Marcos Alonso and Callum Hudson-Odoi in three each. There has been a collective commitment to compensate for Hazard\u2019s loss.

The quality and range of his passes \u2013 it would be an insult to many of them to call them crosses \u2013 is quite staggering for a 21\u2011year\u2011old, and for much of the game against Spurs he was Liverpool\u2019s biggest threat. It feels a bit churlish, giving the brilliance of his attacking, to acknowledge his occasionally immature defending. But that\u2019s what opposition managers will be doing because it\u2019s the closest thing Liverpool have to a defensive weakness. Most of Spurs\u2019 chances came down Alexander-Arnold\u2019s side, where Son Heung-min was positioned by Mauricio Pochettino. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s positioning and decision-making are sometimes awry. Then again, you can say that of most defenders of his age. If his attacking play didn\u2019t have the poise of a world-class player in his prime, maybe we wouldn\u2019t expect as much of him defensively.

Daniel Farke was correct in his assessment that his team were short of the physical commitment to make this a contest. What he didn\u2019t say was that they also lacked the pace to counterattack and the poise to keep possession, a quality that was supposed to be their forte. Opponents have worked out how to neutralise Norwich and Emi Buend\u00eda and Moritz Leitner, who appeared too good for the Championship, are struggling to prove their worth. The Canaries\u2019 next play Brighton and Watford and improved performances and results will be needed if this Norfolk project isn\u2019t to take on the appearance of a wherry holed beneath the waterline.

Pep Guardiola pointed to how he guided Barcelona to Champions League final triumph over Manchester United in 2009 as the inspiration to overcome the defensive crisis. \u201cMy first Champions League final, we had a back four with three injuries to the normal starters: against Cristiano [Ronaldo], [Ryan] Giggs, one of the best squads I ever faced in my career. I prefer to have Laporte, but today [against Aston Villa] John Stones played incredibly well apart from one or two actions and we were solid defensively. We have the players [we have], so OK: we go with them. That is the best way.\u201d Jamie Jackson\n\n\u2022 Match report: Manchester City 3-0 Aston Villa\n\n6) Holgate convinced Toffees\u2019 luck will turn\n\nThe unlucky defeat at Brighton \u2013 Everton\u2019s sixth loss in 10 Premier League matches this season \u2013 did nothing to help Marco Silva win over the club\u2019s fans who say he is not the manager to take them forward. But Mason Holgate, who played well on his first top-flight start for the club in more than a year, says the players remain right behind him. \u201cI think that\u2019s showed in the last two performances we\u2019ve put out. Last week [in the 2-0 win against West Ham] we were all unbelievable and then this week we were doing really well and there was a [VAR] decision that just completely put the game on its head.\u201d Graham Potter reckoned Everton\u2019s performance suggested Holgate\u2019s words were not platitudes. \u201cThey had great intensity and structure and a great work ethic. I\u2019m pretty sure that if they maintain that level they\u2019ve had in the last two games they\u2019ll pick points up.\u201d Paul Doyle\n\n\u2022 Match report: Brighton 3-2 Everton\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everton manager Marco Silva remonstrates with the referee at the end of his team\u2019s defeat at Brighton.

But, and it is a big but, it should have been academic. Had Newcastle possessed an effective centre\u2011forward they would surely have had the game all but won by the interval. Joelinton cost \u00a340m from Hoffenheim but the 23-year-old Brazilian striker \u2013 deployed in a left-sided attacking role in Germany where he was never a prolific scorer \u2013 is struggling badly and, failing to hold the ball up, emphasising why Steve Bruce\u2019s predecessor, Rafael Ben\u00edtez was so desperate to sign Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n permanently from West Brom. Instead Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy said Rond\u00f3n was too old so both he and Ben\u00edtez are now in China. If only Mike Ashley had listened.

The Austrian\u2019s job now is to pick them up for back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City full in the knowledge that another mauling could cost him his job. No one expects them to get anything from the two games but considering the Saints manager\u2019s acceptance that there was \u201cno fight for anything\u201d on Friday night, so the manner of the performances this week will be all-important: the players will need to prove to the fans that they are committed to the cause, and dogged determination is necessary to get them out of their current hole. Southampton are demoralised from their historic defeat so changes will be made to personnel but Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s real test will be to change the mentality.

The Austrian was unreliable, he turned 30 in April and his behaviour left much to be desired before his move to the Chinese Super League last summer. But he was one hell of a player when he was in the mood. Arnautovic\u2019s individual quality was a crucial weapon for West Ham and his replacement, S\u00e9bastien Haller, is struggling to fit in. Haller toiled during this 1-1 draw and the \u00a345m signing is crying out for more support and better service from Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko. The 25\u2011year\u2011old is a more traditional target man than Arnautovic, who preferred to run behind defences and create chances for himself, and West Ham need to start playing to Haller\u2019s strengths. The Frenchman has scored once in his past seven games, so Manuel Pellegrini needs to make changes. Jacob Steinberg\n\n\u2022 Match report: West Ham 1-1 Sheffield United\n\n10) Flores\u2019s resilient Hornets set stage for Deeney return\n\nFor a team that haven\u2019t won a league game all season, Watford are in pretty good health. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has stabilised the team as promised, with three consecutive draws and only one goal conceded. But their defensive improvement has had a knock-on effect at the other end. They rarely looked like scoring against Bournemouth, despite the highlights-friendly brilliance of Gerard Deulofeu. S\u00e1nchez Flores has preferred a back three \u2013 and, in this match, a fluid strike partnership of Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra. It\u2019s an intriguing, modern tactic, but it looks better on paper than it did on the pitch on Saturday. Watford are in need of something more old-fashioned: a No 9, a goalscorer and a hero. It\u2019s all set up for Troy Deeney, who should return next month after a knee operation, to ride to the rescue once again.
