Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaks during a town hall meeting at the LeFrak City Queens Library on Thursday in the Queens borough of New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nFor most of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) Thursday town hall, the woman in a black jacket sat quietly in the third row. Then, as the event in Corona, N.Y., neared its end, the woman suddenly stood up and began yelling about climate change.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not going to be here much long because of the climate crisis,\u201d the woman blurted. \u201cWe got to start eating babies,\u201d she abruptly declared, taking off her jacket to display a T-shirt that read, \u201cSave the planet. Eat the children.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s bizarre speech swiftly became the center of a heated Twitter fight Thursday night that pitted Ocasio-Cortez against President Trump, his son, Donald Trump Jr., and other conservatives, who suggested the woman was an example \u201cclimate change hysteria.\u201d In response, Ocasio-Cortez chastised critics for trying to \u201cmock or make a spectacle\u201d of a woman who \u201cmay have been suffering from a mental condition.\u201d\n\nIt now seems likely that the scene was carefully planned.\n\nThe woman was apparently part of an attempt by a right-wing fringe political group to embarrass the Democratic congresswoman. Late Thursday, a Twitter account belonging to the LaRouche PAC \u2014 which was founded by conspiracy theorist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. \u2014 took credit for the stunt. A historian who has documented the organization said the woman\u2019s outburst was \u201ca fairly well-established tactic for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this since the \u201970s,\u201d Matthew Sweet, whose book \u201cOperation Chaos\u201d delved into the group\u2019s complex history, told The Washington Post. \u201cThe tactic is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.\u201d\n\nThe LaRouche PAC did not respond to a request for comment early Friday.\n\nDescribed by Sweet as a \u201cbizarre political cult,\u201d LaRouche led the group until he died in February at 96. LaRouche, who ran for president eight times between 1976 and 2004, \u201cbuilt a worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism,\u201d The Post\u2019s Timothy R. Smith wrote. In its early years, the organization\u2019s views skewed left, but LaRouche\u2019s vision eventually shifted, becoming \u201cultraconservative and apocalyptic,\u201d The Post reported. More recently, the group has expressed support for Trump.\n\n[Lyndon LaRouche Jr., conspiracy theorist and presidential candidate, dies at 96]\n\nKnown as \u201cLaRouchians,\u201d the group has \u201calways been tiny,\u201d Sweet told The Post, but its members have still managed to make waves in American politics. The list of high-profile figures they have publicly heckled and harassed range from actress Jane Fonda to former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, he said.\n\nThe woman\u2019s appearance at Thursday\u2019s town hall is \u201cthe kind of noise and chaos that they have always delighted in,\u201d Sweet said.\n\nVideo showed the woman getting increasingly worked up as Ocasio-Cortez listened and nodded with a concerned expression. At least two people in the crowd took out their phones, aiming them at the woman.\n\n\u201cEven if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution, so we have to get rid of the babies,\u201d the woman shouted. \u201cJust stopping having babies is not enough, we need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nSoon, the members of the crowd who had been largely silent, started murmuring. Another person approached the unruly woman and tried to intervene, while Ocasio-Cortez attempted to gain control of the room.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present,\u201d the lawmaker said once the woman had stopped yelling. \u201cLuckily, we have more than a few months.\u201d\n\nThough Ocasio-Cortez quickly moved on to another question, the woman continued to try to talk, prompting two people to escort her from her seat.\n\nBy early Friday, a number of news outlets, including some conservative websites, had published articles about the woman\u2019s comments. A two-minute video of the event had garnered more than 5 million views on Twitter, drawing reactions from Trump and Trump Jr., and the hashtag \u201c#EatTheBabies\u201d was trending.\n\nTrump Jr. tweeted that the woman \u201cSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me,\u201d and the president retweeted his son, adding, \u201cAOC is a Wack Job!\"\n\nAOC is a Wack Job! https://t.co/LU3hIeek0c \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nIn a tweet addressing the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez hit back at critics, writing, \u201cAt one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis,\u201d adding that she wanted to \u201censure we treat the situation compassionately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her,\u201d she wrote minutes later. \u201cBe a decent human being and knock it off.\u201d\n\nThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the LaRouche PAC Twitter account, which Sweet confirmed is operated by the group, was crowing.\n\n\u201cLaRouche PAC trolls AOC, AOC doesn\u2019t rule out eating babies. #EatTheBabies,\u201d it tweeted.\n\nThroughout Thursday night, the group repeatedly confirmed their involvement in replies to various Twitter users, writing, \u201cIt was us.\u201d\n\nDaniel Burke, who is affiliated with the group and is running as an independent for a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey, also shared posts on his social media platforms giving credit to the LaRouche organization for sparking the trending hashtag.\n\n#EatTheBabies is trending! That was the LaRouche movement! Posted by Daniel Burke on Thursday, October 3, 2019\n\nSweet said he has never seen the woman in the video before, but a person who looked like her showed up in photos posted on the LaRouche PAC\u2019s Facebook page Wednesday. A description of the photos said they were taken in New York earlier this week as members challenged students \u201cwith a polemical campaign, \u2018Eat the Children,\u2019 signing up man-made global warming believers to reduce the planet\u2019s population one child at a time!\u201d\n\nThe woman also appeared to be behind a video uploaded Thursday by Burke, who claimed the clip was an \u201cexclusive interview with a representative from \u2018Eat the Children,\u2019 the organization which intervened on AOC today at her own town hall!\u201d\n\nA representative for Ocasio-Cortez could not be reached for comment early Friday.\n\nThough the group seems to be trying to \u201cget as much capital as they can\u201d from the viral video, Sweet said he doesn\u2019t think they are \u201cgoing to be too elevated\u201d by the incident.\n\n\u201cEnemies of AOC are going to use this against her and they don\u2019t care who this woman was,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cThe noise that they\u2019ve made is going to drown out their part in the process.\u201d", "description": "The woman interrupted Rep.
