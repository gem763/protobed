How, and Why, Artists Exchange Work", "language": "en", "text": "As a writer, it\u2019s hard not to feel a twinge of envy. No matter how good we are, David Adjaye, the star architect who has helped design studios for Simpson, Chris Ofili and others, is unlikely to propose a plan for our next office in exchange for an incisive 1,500-word think piece. The very materiality of visual art \u2014 its implicit singularity and primacy \u2014 is what creates the desire to possess it; living with a work, it is possible to inhabit, with an intimacy that can be surprising, the mind space of another artist. \u201cThere is something about owning an art object that enables a different kind of access,\u201d the sculptor and installation artist Jessica Stockholder tells me, referring to the Bernard Frize painting, \u201cSuite \u00e0 Onze No. 2,\u201d she\u2019s had in her living room for the last 10 years: a mesmerizing white canvas with a single line coiling in and around itself and changing hues at regular intervals, creating an illusion of depth. \u201cHe proposed a trade, and it was really flattering because I\u2019d never met him, and his work was so different than mine.\u201d (Both Stockholder and the French painter show at Galerie N\u00e4chst St. Stephan in Vienna; Frize currently has a show at Perrotin gallery in New York.) Frize chose a large sculpture of Stockholder\u2019s: an assemblage of yellow cushions, blue tarps and red measuring cups. In this case, it was the trade that ignited a friendship, rather than the other way around: They\u2019ve been close ever since.\n\nThis kind of ongoing conversation, an ambition-stoking, view-enlarging exchange of ideas about art\u2019s potential, is, surely, the dream \u2014 one that puts the lie to the romantic stereotype of the solitary artist, alone against the world. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like having a ski buddy,\u201d says Matthew Day Jackson of his friendship with the artist Rashid Johnson. \u201cYou\u2019re there going skiing together to make sure the other is safe, but at the same time, if they\u2019re doing something cool, it\u2019s like, \u2018Whoa, look at that, that\u2019s beautiful.\u2019\u201d Both artists have embraced a kind of post-medium sensibility \u2014 they use esoteric materials, like black soap in Johnson\u2019s case, or prosthetic limbs for Jackson. They began trading work when they were both represented by the Nicole Klagsbrun gallery in New York about 10 years ago. Since then, they\u2019ve exchanged work of increasing seriousness, establishing parameters such as size or medium in advance. Recently, both artists were exploring fire and wood, resulting in large-format flat works; Johnson traded \u201cSafe Travels\u201d \u2014 an oblong of wood branded with circles \u2014 for a piece titled \u201cAugust 6, 1945,\u201d depicting the city of Hamburg. The latter, a spectacular 8-by-10-foot-long work of burned wood and lead, currently hangs in the entryway to the Manhattan home Johnson shares with his wife, the artist Sheree Hovsepian, and their young son.\n\n\u201cEveryone who comes over to my house will ask, \u2018Did you make this?\u2019\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAnd I always have to shamefully admit that I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a really healthy jealousy that I have of an object. I live with it, and I love it. I probably borrow from it; it\u2019s about abstraction and place and reimagined histories. It\u2019s a great work, and I\u2019m really proud to have it in my home.\u201d Trading with artists he respects, according to Johnson, \u201cis born of a real aspiration to live with their objects and to keep my own thinking in a place where I feel like I\u2019m investigating the art of my time.\u201d Art-making is always some form of faith, a private foray into parts unknown; reaching a hand out, then, feels like not only an investment in another artist\u2019s work but in the larger human struggle to innovate, to find new ways of expressing beauty, meaning and what we call originality. To this, Johnson adds, \u201cIf you want to be an artist, you have to really love art, you know?\u201d", "description": "The shadow economy of trades is both a holdover from the past and a vital practice that keeps artists honest \u2014 or at least competitive with their peers.", "authors": ["Megan O Grady"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/t-magazine/20tmag-trading-slide-PD5J-copy/20tmag-trading-slide-PD5J-copy-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
