I\u2019m 49-years-old but feel like 69.\n\n\u201cI used to be a nice and caring guy that would do anything for anyone.\n\n(Image: Roland Leon/Sunday Mirror)\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried so many times to take my life, but for some reason always pulled through (why).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a good husband/Dad, when that\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\nThe former Staffordshire Regiment soldier served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Bosnia and was diagnosed with PTSD in 2006.\n\nHe suffered violent mood swings, flashbacks, nightmares and \u00adsurvivors\u2019 guilt and spent years self-medicating with drugs and alcohol.\n\nShortly before his death Jo took out a court order to ban him from the family home in Birmingham after he smashed the place up.\n\nHis letter goes on: \u201cFor many years now something went wrong, really wrong and I never saw it, or should I say I chose not to see it.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cI am labelled with PTSD and over the last few years I\u2019ve become a nasty person. All I do is take, take, take and give nothing back, which is wrong.\n\n\u201cI am the only person in this house that is always right, but I know that\u2019s not the case. I hurt the people who mean the most to me and I don\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cMy family deserve more and better things than they have now. I have no idea why they are still here. All the help I have ever got is because my wife has got it for me. I have no idea why she does it, but she does.\n\n\u201cIf I have to tell the truth I\u2019m so scared of getting help as I think I have failed. I have done more things than most people so I should be proud not feel like I have failed.\n\n\u201cI find it so hard when someone tells me that I\u2019m wrong but I have to try to understand I\u2019m not always right, which is very hard.\n\n\u201cI really want treatment, but it scares me so much it\u2019s unreal. I don\u2019t want to face the truth but I know I have to beat this to be the man my family deserve.\n\n\u201cBut how do I defeat the thoughts in my head about death and \u00adeveryone is against me? Anything goes wrong in my life and that\u2019s the first thing I think of. I\u2019m a good guy at heart but can switch so fast and I don\u2019t even know I\u2019m doing it.\n\n\u201cI have so much to offer, but no idea how to show it or do it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nice to know I hurt the ones that love and care about me (that really hurts me). \u201cI just hope I can cope with whatever \u00adtreatment they offer me, as this life is s***.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to see what I\u2019ve done in the past. I want to go out and not have earphones in, just so that I feel safe.\n\n\u201cBut I will beat this with the right help and have the best family support as well.\u201d\n\n(Image: Roland Leon/Sunday Mirror)\n\nA week after signing the letter to a therapist he was found hanged on October 9 last year.\n\nMum-of-two Jo, a teacher, released the note on the first anniversary as part of Mental Health Awareness Week.\n\nThe loss of her husband and years of living with a mentally ill veteran took a terrible toll and last month she was diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nMore than q00 \u00adveterans and serving personnel have taken their lives since January last year.\n\nThe Sunday People\u2019s Save Our Soldiers \u00adcampaign is calling for a radical overhaul of mental health treatment for \u00adsoldiers and veterans.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Sunday People is demanding better mental health treatment for soldiers and veterans", "authors": ["Sean Rayment", "Image", "Sunday Mirror", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566123.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MSM_171018_PTSD_15JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
