They've lived with the pretense for so long that it'll all be alright on the day.\n\n\"But this must be causing them inner concern. Because if in two months all of this comes about they will be held responsible. I think the transport secretary ought to stand up in parliament and make a statement about it.\"", "description": "Delays at the UK ports would impact the inward flow of fresh food and medicine to the United Kingdom.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6cd2c62e22af515f1276f4-960-480.jpg"}
