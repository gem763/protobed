They are the ones controlling the State of Syria, the Army of Syria, the security of Syria and are infiltrating the society such as the schools and religious sites,\u201d Nasr Al-Hariri, president of the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC), told Fox News following the U.N. General Assembly last week. \u201cWhile the air cover is being provided to the government by Russia, the troops on the ground are controlled by Iran.\u201d\n\nMost disturbing, Hariri underscored, is that many who oppose the government and have been rendered little choice but return to their broken lives and homes are now aligning with Iranian militias for survival.\n\n\u201cThey see the allies have left us alone inside Syria, so they can only protect themselves this way, and Iran is giving them some incentives to join,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey get salaries between $300-600 a month, and a security card to go all over the country without being interrupted or harmed at Syrian regime checkpoints. This is their protection, and it is very dangerous. If the situation continues like this, the number of recruited Iranian people will gradually increase.\u201d\n\nFAMILY MURDER SUICIDES IN YEMEN HIGHLIGHT DEPTHS OF WAR-INDUCED MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS\n\nIn April, the Syrian government \u2013 backed by Russian air support \u2013 launched an intensive campaign to reclaim Idlib, the last enduring opposition stronghold. But after four months and countless lives and injured later, the majority of the region was still out of their reach.\n\n\u201cThe regime was not able to get any significant progress on the ground, so for that reason, the Iranian militias have intervened to help more,\u201d Hariri said.\n\nHariri asserted that there are more than 60 militias in Syria that are either Iranian or affiliated with Iran.\n\n\u201cThey (Iran) are trying to establish their own military strategy inside Syria and infiltrate Syrian society,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are recruiting ex-fighters of the Syrian Army as part of their own militias inside Syria so they can see them in the future because their projects in the wider region depend on chaos.\u201d\n\nThe opposition leader contended that Iran is explicitly not involved in the ongoing peace-centered talks that other players such as Russia and Turkey engage in, nor does it co-operate with inter-country military dialogues, because their vision does not require diplomacy.\n\n\u201cIranians are working to destroy any effort for an agreement inside Syria because they know that at the moment Syrians reach a political solution, they will be forced to go outside of Syria and they don\u2019t want to reach that point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t imagine that there will be a political solution in Syria while the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is present, and the militias are exercising their maligned activities.\u201d\n\nIRANIAN-FLAGGED OIL TANKER PREVIOUSLY SEIZED FOR VIOLATING EU SANCTIONS PICTURED OFF COAST OF SYRIA AGAIN\n\nFrom his point of view, the United States and its coalition partners should adopt a similar policy in the North-West enclave of Idlib to the one they have established in the North-East of Syria, in supporting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\n\u201cAmericans have protected that area to be assured that ISIS does not enter the area and have prevented the regime and Russia from entering,\u201d Hariri said. \u201cThey can say again; we want to be sure Iran does not enter this (Idlib) area until we can be sure there is a serious political process on the way.\u201d\n\nRepresenting the fractured and pariah Damascus government at the U.N.'s General Assembly was Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, who demanded the prompt pullout of all foreign forces. He insisted that the country reserves the right to take action against any unauthorized forces in their terrain.\n\nMuallem, according to officials not authorized to speak on the record, was not granted the privileges given to most global diplomats in visiting New York for the assembly. He faced movement restrictions and was forced to wait in \u201cregular\u201d rather than \u201cdiplomatic\u201d immigration lines.\n\nSince the start of Syria\u2019s bloody revolution in 2011, Iran has been playing an increasingly pivotal role in keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power. While Tehran endeavors to protect and disseminate its brand of Shia Islam \u2013 of which Assad is a Shia offshoot known as Alawite \u2013 experts contend their interests run deeper.\n\n\u201cIran has invested considerable amounts of blood, treasure, and national reputation to defend the Assad regime,\u201d said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). \u201cThat is Iran\u2019s anchor in the Mediterranean and the Levantine world. Without Syria, the Iranian project to export the revolution would likely face collapse.\u201d\n\nWHERE DOES MEXICO REALLY GET ITS GUNS?\n\nAccording to Taleblu, Syria is also integral to Iran\u2019s more recent goal to create a land corridor from Iran \u201cto ferry men, money, and munitions to battlefields across the Middle East and eventually reach the eastern Mediterranean.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd while the Syrian conflict has been horrifying humanitarian experience, it has been a strategic boost for the Islamic Republic,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cThe regime is using the experience learned in the war to make its militia\u2019s inter-operable and better connected for the next conflict.\u201d\n\nTehran has long been providing Damascus with crucial military supplies and equipment, along with deploying intelligence services, law enforcement personnel, and even their elite IRGC Ground Forces. In 2012, Iran began establishing pro-government militias to support the Assad regime and the missions of Lebanese Hezbollah often deemed a proxy of the Iranian government.\n\nEven amid its own financial turmoil and blistering international sanctions, the Iranian government \u2013 per U.N. estimates \u2013 has spent upwards of $6 billion annually to bolster the Assad regime, a sum that does not include the scope of its own military operation.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAnd the next step for the broken and battered nation remains to be seen, with the future of the enduring Idlib still languishing in limbo.\n\n\u201cThe international community has voices faint outcry against the violence in Idlib, just statements and condemnation but not responsive steps have been taken to stop it,\u201d Hariri added. \u201cTheir lives are under threat, and if (another offensive) begins, 3.8 million will flood to Turkey and then into the rest of the world, and there will be another refugee crisis.\u201d", "description": "After more than eight years of war and bloodshed in Syria, the Iranian presence\u00a0in the nation is at an all-time high, warned the top Syrian opposition figure.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
