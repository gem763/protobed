Last month when a newspaper columnist called her \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d, she responded by asking: \u201cWhere are the adults?\u201d.\n\nIn her speech, Ms Bachelet also joined the global outcry in recent weeks over far-right Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro for his handling of fires that continue to ravage the Amazon rainforest.\n\n\u201cThe fires currently raging across the rainforest may have catastrophic impact on humanity as a whole,\u201d Ms Bachelet said, \u201cbut their worst effects are suffered by the women, men and children who live in these areas, among them, many indigenous peoples.\u201d\n\nMs Bachelet, a former president of Chile, urged authorities in Brazil, as well as Paraguay and Bolivia, to ensure \u201clongstanding environmental policies\u201d are carried out, \u201cthus preventing future tragedies.\u201d\n\nShe also spoke of her \u201calarm\u201d at migrant children still being held in detention centres in the United States and Mexico, expressing concern that policies by the United States, Mexico and others in the region \u201care putting migrants at heightened risk of human rights violations and abuses.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration pulled the United States out of the council last year, accusing it of an anti-Israel bias and denouncing some member states that Washington says are repeat rights violators.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "The United Nations human rights chief has condemned \u201cverbal attacks\u201d on teenage environmental\u00a0activist Greta Thunberg\u00a0after calling on government to take the threat posed by climate change\u00a0more seriously.
