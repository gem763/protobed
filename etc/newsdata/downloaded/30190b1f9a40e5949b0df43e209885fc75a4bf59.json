I\u2019m not referring to a contemporary figure, but to the founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn, who is in so many ways dissimilar to today\u2019s politicians and their vitriolic discourse. Consider Penn\u2019s maxim on speech, \u201cIf thou thinkest twice, before thou speakest once, thou wilt speak twice the better of it\u201d \u2014 a welcomed perspective in our age of Twitterspeak.\n\nBorn 375 years ago, Penn was the son of an English admiral, Sir William Penn. Although baptized in the Church of England, Penn\u2019s interest in the Bible led him to become a Quaker. The Society of Friends (Quakers) was a nonconforming sect championing social ethics rooted in the biblical ideal of love. Because of his family\u2019s notoriety and political connections, Penn became the Friends\u2019 high-profile public advocate for the freedom to believe and practice faith without state restrictions and interference.\n\nPenn\u2019s ideals about religious liberty and the collective rights of freedom of speech, press, assembly and petition landed him in jail on several occasions. If anyone had reason to be angry and vitriolic, it was Penn. Yet, his vision for a society of love and liberty prevailed and animated his reform efforts in England. Eventually Penn looked to America as the place to demonstrate his \u201choly experiment\u201d in politics. With his family\u2019s wealth and favor of the British Royals, Penn obtained a charter from King Charles II for a land grant in 1681.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe King\u2019s charter made Penn the owner and proprietor of nearly 50,000 square miles. It was his to develop, manage and govern with the stipulations that the new colony be named for Penn\u2019s father, the admiral, and that the Province\u2019s laws be consistent with English law. Penn, however, was additionally concerned that native inhabitants be justly treated and fairly compensated for the land he was to develop. His view was that, \u201cThe Indians and English must live in love, as long as the sun gave light.\u201d\n\nIn less than a decade after New England\u2019s horrific King Philip\u2019s War, which decimated the Native American population in that region, Penn demonstrated the possibility for a different path in Native American relations \u2014 love and friendship. His famed Treaty of Shackamaxon has since become legend, an event beautifully depicted by American artists Benjamin West and Edward Hicks.\n\nPenn named his capital \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d from the Bible. The city\u2019s name is a contraction of two New Testament Greek words meaning \u201cbrotherly love.\u201d Love was to be the compelling ethic binding people together in their common life. Penn conceived of Pennsylvania as a commonwealth, a society existing from and committed to the good of all. Love, not self-interest (enlightened or otherwise), was the foundation for flourishing community and civic life.\n\nThe ethic of love distinguishes Penn\u2019s social vision as communitarian rather than libertarian. In Penn\u2019s view, the source of love was God. He frequented quoted St. John, \u201cHe that lives in love lives in God.\u201d People, he reasoned, needed the personal freedom to be convinced of this truth. Faith in God could not be coerced but must be understood and willfully embraced. Therefore, the fundament of Penn\u2019s constitution for Pennsylvania, his Charter of Privileges, was religious liberty \u2014 the freedom to believe and practice one\u2019s faith without disturbance. Penn believed that political liberty, and even economic prosperity, were predicated upon religious liberty. If all were free to believe, they might find love, the love of God that binds humanity together and seeks the mutual beneficence of one another. Liberty, for Penn, was instrumental to a just and prosperous society.\n\nAs a corollary to its religious liberty, Pennsylvania soon became a successful political experiment in religious pluralism and toleration. At the time, the Province was arguably the most liberal and democratic society in the world welcoming European immigrants of multiple ethnicities and religions by the boatloads. German Quakers, Anabaptists, Lutherans and Reformed flocked to Pennsylvania, and so did English Baptists, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, Dutch Mennonites and Reformed, Irish Catholics, as well as Sephardic Jews. The Anglicans came, too; those of England\u2019s church-state establishment who oppressed other sects enjoyed freedom in Pennsylvania.\n\nIs brotherly love a compelling value today? Is Penn\u2019s vision still relevant for American society? Has his holy experiment been validated? Penn believed, \u201cLove is above all; and when it prevails in us all, we shall all be lovely, and in love with God and one another.\u201d He also acknowledged that love was \u201cthe hardest lesson\u201d of his faith, and yet maintained \u201cfor that reason, it should be most our care to learn it.\u201d Perhaps, in the words of Penn, we must continue to \u201ctry what love will do.\u201d\n\nAlan R.
