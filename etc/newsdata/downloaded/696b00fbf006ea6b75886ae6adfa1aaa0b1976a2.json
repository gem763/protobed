Pompeo will gently make his point that he has a different view, but if Trump indicates he\u2019s going in a different direction, he\u2019ll get on board. Bolton did not.\u201d\n\nBolton is an old-fashioned hawk when it comes to the Iranian nuclear threat. Defanging the Middle East adversary comes down to steady pressure and, ultimately, regime change, Bolton believes. For all his bellicose rhetoric, Trump remains wary of military action. He worried that Bolton would draw him into unnecessary wars, while Bolton seemed dubious about Trump\u2019s quixotic push to reach a diplomatic breakthrough with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The marriage had long ago unraveled; the only question was when Trump would tweet the divorce.\n\nBolton\u2019s unceremonious exit came with another first: The victim fought back. Rather than stick to tradition when dumped and keep quiet, Bolton tweeted that Trump\u2019s version of events was wrong and that he had in fact \u201coffered to resign\u201d last night, but that Trump had told him: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nInside the White House, aides seemed confused about whether Bolton was staying or going. About an hour before Trump\u2019s announcement, the White House sent out a notice saying that Bolton would appear with Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at a rare press briefing at the White House. Mnuchin and Pompeo showed up; Bolton, newly fired, did not. Is the president\u2019s national-security team \u201ca mess?,\u201d a reporter asked the pair. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous question I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d\n\nBoth were quick to showcase Bolton\u2019s isolation. \u201cThere were definitely places Ambassador Bolton and I had different views about where we should proceed,\u201d Pompeo said. Mnuchin noted that the president and Bolton differed on the Iraq War.\n\nBolton\u2019s ouster was hardly a surprise. Indeed, the most bewildering aspect of his tenure may have been why it lasted as long as it did. Trump tapped him for the job in March 2018 as a replacement for H. R. McMaster, who had developed little personal chemistry with Trump. The president would grow impatient with McMaster\u2019s briefings laying out detailed national-security options, former White House aides have told me. Meanwhile, Trump had seen Bolton\u2019s regular appearances on Fox News and relished the way he validated the administration\u2019s policies. Always on the prowl for appointees who look like they\u2019re from what he calls \u201cCentral Casting,\u201d Trump was at first put off by Bolton\u2019s push-broom mustache.", "description": "The marriage had long ago unraveled; the only question was when Trump would tweet the divorce.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX5KX8G/facebook.jpg?1568155640", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
