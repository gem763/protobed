The veteran American Funds investor had left parent company Capital Group about six weeks prior on Sept. 9 for what the firm would only describe at the time as a \u201cpersonnel decision.\u201d As it turns out, conflicts of interest were at the heart of the matter.\n\nThe BBC discovered that Denning, while a portfolio manager on American Funds SMALLCAP World (SMCWX), had invested that strategy\u2019s money for years into Hummingbird Resources, even as his adult daughter became engaged and married to Hummingbird Resources\u2019 CEO Daniel Betts. The portion of SMALLCAP World\u2019s assets invested in Hummingbird Resource was relatively tiny; it peaked at less than 4 basis points in September 2017. It did, however, represent a significant stake in the company, more than 7% of shares outstanding as early as January 27, 2011, per regulatory filings.\n\nThe BBC also discovered the existence since Aug. 31, 2017, of a private third-party family trust called IPF Investment Fund - Global Opportunities\u201d (formerly Morebath Fund - Global Opportunities), which it alleges is connected to Denning, at least indirectly. The trust holds or has held several stocks in common with two of Denning\u2019s American Funds strategies, SMALLCAP World and American Funds New Economy (ANEFX). One of those stocks is Hummingbird Resources, for example. Like the Hummingbird Resources position in SMALLCAP World, these other stocks, seven in total and not just the three mentioned by the BBC, represented relatively tiny stakes within their respective American Funds\u2019 portfolios, even if those funds\u2019 ownership of the companies\u2019 shares outstanding was significant.\n\nCapital Group was not aware of any of this until the BBC contacted the firm for comment during the week of Sept. 2-6. Once informed, Capital Group acted swiftly. Despite Denning\u2019s more than 35-year tenure and his reputation as one of the firm\u2019s savviest investors, he was gone within a matter of days.\n\nSince this news first broke, Morningstar Manager Research analysts have spent many hours assessing as far as possible what happened. That\u2019s included conversations with senior Capital Group personnel, such as Chairman Timothy Armour, detailed analysis of the ownership of the stocks in question within SMALLCAP World and New Economy, and considerable internal dialogue.\n\nMorningstar has concluded that Capital Group\u2019s Code of Ethics should be strengthened. In its current form, the Code only requires disclosure of investments involving family members living in one\u2019s household and does not directly address investments like Hummingbird Resources, which involved a family member not living in one\u2019s household at the time. The Code of Ethics does, however, forbid investment personnel from involvement in family trusts that hold the same securities as their American Funds\u2019 strategies. Despite the existence of such a trust, it does not appear that Denning\u2019s actions harmed fundholders, and it\u2019s unclear there was something reasonable Capital Group could have done to flag the ethically questionable behavior that went unreported in this case until the BBC revealed it. Based on what Morningstar has seen thus far, this very unfortunate situation should not detract from Capital Group\u2019s stature as an industry standard bearer in many respects, a position it has secured by serving investors well for nearly 90 years. Capital Group retains its Positive Parent rating.\n\nMorningstar will have more to say on the details surrounding Denning\u2019s departure and the lessons to be learned from it, as they touch on many issues. In the end, though, investors in Capital Group\u2019s American Funds should rest assured that their assets are still in good hands.", "description": "Capital Group retains its Positive Parent rating, and investors in American Funds should rest assured that their assets are still in good hands.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltd374c2b82e25483d/5cf68f9fd8bbe50306d2a0a7/Rating_Medals_1x1.svg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
