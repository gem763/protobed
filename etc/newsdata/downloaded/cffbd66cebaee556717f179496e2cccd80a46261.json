He also claims the doping control officer assured him this would not count as a missed test as they had come outside the scheduled whereabouts window.\n\nDescribing the fact that the case was leaked to the media as \u201ca shame on USADA\u201d, particularly when they did not appear \u201cto know their own rules\u201d, Coleman tells his fans that he was \u201clucky\u201d to have the resources to hire a good lawyer and miss several races while the case was resolved.\n\nHe said if he was one of the sport\u2019s lesser lights he could have been \u201crun over\u201d by USADA, which \u201cis designed to protect athletes but I felt like they were going at me and they were after a big fish\u201d.\n\nClaiming he missed two events, including August\u2019s Birmingham Grand Prix, which cost him \u00a3120,000 in lost earnings, Coleman said: \u201cI feel like I deserve a public apology, because I\u2019m a victim. I missed two track meets, switched up my schedule and been running with the stress of this situation in my mind.\u201d\n\nHe then criticises those who rushed to judgement against him and accused the media of being obsessed with \u201cnegative, tabloid\u201d stories.\n\nColeman finishes the video, however, by saying he feels ready \u201cto go to Doha and bring back some medals\u201d and perhaps even \u201cbreak some records\u201d in the sprint relay.\n\nPA", "description": "American sprinter Christian Coleman has accused the United States Anti-Doping Agency of \u201cgoing after a big fish\u201d and demanded a \u201cpublic apology\u201d after a case against him was dropped two days before the hearing earlier this month.
