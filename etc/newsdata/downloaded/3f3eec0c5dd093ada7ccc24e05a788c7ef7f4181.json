Thus, in a wave of Airpods, Vineyard Vines, and reservations at Cipriani, enter the finance memers, or \" finfluencers.\"\n\nA deep dive in the Institutional Investor by Alicia McElhaney cast a Golden-Bull-colored spotlight on the financers who have amassed followings in the tens and hundreds of thousands.\n\nBut, much like the often anonymous Wall Streeters powering these accounts, finfluencer pages may be more than just a safe Internet space to do hard-hitting analysis on various spiked seltzers. In an interview with one finfluencer, @otherbondgirl, McElhaney found that it may be beneficial to aspiring financiers to stay abreast of \"finmemes.\"\n\n@otherbondgirl told McElhany that before the news was even posted online, she learned from finmemes that Goldman Sachs was hiring coders.\n\n\"It's funny how quickly information gets disseminated and how quickly perceptions are changed in that little subculture. It's different from what happens on Twitter,\" @otherbondgirl said to McElhany.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time someone got hired via meme\n\nIn April, Business Insider's Graham Rapier reported that the meme skills of the Museum of English Rural Life's social media manager may have landed him a gig at Tesla.\n\nRapier reported that, after Musk tweeted a photo from the museum (a sheep that was, as identified by Musk, an \"absolute unit\"), the museum and Musk began Twitter meme banter. Over a month later, Adam Koszary, the man behind the museum's virality, tweeted that he was being tapped to run Tesla's social media, Rapier reported.\n\nMusk tweeted the sheep, the museum followed up, and the rest is history.\n\nFinmemes can help job seekers learn the lingo and culture of finance\n\nOne finmemer interviewed by McElhaney hasn't even embarked on her career in finance yet. @wallstreetconfessions told McElhaney that she is currently a student at a non-target school studying finance; her account compiles anonymous Wall Street confessions.\n\nIt would make sense, then, in an industry where landing a job is often contingent upon heavy pre-interview preparation and research that studying \u2014 or, better yet, running \u2014 meme pages could give applicants a leg-up. After all, it's a way to acclimate to the rather unique culture of Wall Street.\n\nLanding a job from a finmeme page seems unlikely, but it's definitely a fun way to get to know finance culture\n\nAfter perusing some finmeme pages, I now know exactly which bars to go to if I want to see finance couples on Hinge dates. I think I may have also figured out who caused the White Claw shortage.\n\nSo if you're looking for a prime networking opportunity, put your MD on mute, hop in that Uber XL, head to Cipriani, and send someone a drink. Who knows what you'll learn?", "description": "Are the memes funny? That's for Wall Street insiders to decide.
