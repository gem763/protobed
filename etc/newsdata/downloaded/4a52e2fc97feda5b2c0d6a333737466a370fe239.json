We have lots of water in between our country and them,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Trump has made similar threats several times in the past, saying earlier this month that he was unconcerned over the potential escape of Isis fighters because \u201cthey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe\u201d.\n\nIn August, the US president claimed he would \u201crelease [thousands of Isis fighters] to Europe\u201d if they were not repatriated, but the threat has never materialised.\n\nThe US does not directly control the prisons and camps where foreign fighters, female Isis members and their children are being held by Kurdish forces.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Update newsletter preferences\n\nNumerous escapes have been reported since Mr Trump ordered the US military to withdraw from Syria earlier this month, sparking a Turkish-backed incursion into the areas where Isis members were detained.\n\nDivisions between the captives have also sparked assassinations and unrest inside the camps, amid warnings of a potential Isis insurgence.\n\nIn the last audio message released before his death, Baghdadi directly called for his followers to free detained Isis members and their families from camps.\n\nDozens of jihadis from the UK and at least 60 British children who fled Isis-held areas as the group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d fell are thought to be held in northern Syria, including Shamima Begum and Jack Letts.\n\nTwo members of the British Isis terror cell known as \u201cThe Beatles\u201d have already been transferred to US custody for trial over the torture and execution of hostages including James Foley and David Haines.\n\nKurdish commanders in the region have told The Independent they cannot secure Isis prisons and camps if fighting with Turkish forces continues in spite of a Russia-brokered ceasefire.\n\n\u201cWe are still maintaining control but if the Turkish threat and attacks continue, we do not know for how long we will be able to keep these prisons secured,\u201d said Syrian Defence Forces commander Mervan Qamishli.\n\n\u201cWe need help stopping the conflict so that our forces can return to protecting and managing the prisons.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials say that at least 100 Isis fighters have already escaped in the two weeks since Turkey launched its incursion against Kurdish fighters, which were allied to the US-led coalition but considered terrorists by Ankara.\n\nKurdish officials estimate that an additional 800 Isis family members may have also fled from Ain Issa camp, which was home to more than 100,000 displaced people.\n\nThere are also fears over the security of the al-Hol and Roj camps, which are each home to significant populations of foreign Isis suspects.\n\nThe British government has refused to repatriate captives for trial and dramatically increased its use of controversial citizenship deprivation powers to prevent any return to the UK.\n\nReports suggest it may be preparing to transfer children of British jihadis who have been trapped in the warzone, although it is unclear whether the policy would only apply to unaccompanied children and orphans, or those still with their parents.\n\nSeveral MPs have called for the government to repatriate UK extremists, which Kurdish officials called Britain\u2019s \u201cmoral and legal duty\u201d.\n\nIn August, former defence minister Tobias Ellwood warned that the detention of thousands of jihadis and their families in Syria was creating conditions for an Isis resurgence and global terror attacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Daesh 2.0,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a repeat of al-Qaeda regrouping and becoming a very real threat, and that threat won\u2019t just pose itself in the Middle East, but also to Britain.\u201d\n\nThe government welcomed news of Baghdadi\u2019s death on Saturday but experts said that Isis\u2019s bureaucracy and increased focus on international factions outside Iraq and Syria would ensure its survival.\n\nBefore becoming the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the self-declared Islamic State during a 2014 advance, where it waged a campaign of genocide, mass rape and forced against the Yazidi minority, Baghdadi had been captured by US forces.\n\nHe was detained in the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2004 alongside other extremists who would become senior Isis figures.\n\nHe became the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2010 \u2013 a year before the death of Osama bin Laden \u2013 and waged a bloody terrorist campaign in the country before expanding into Syria and declaring the formation of Isis following infighting in 2014.\n\nMr Trump said Baghdadi killed himself and three children by detonating a suicide bomb during a US special forces raid on his Syrian hideout on Saturday.\n\nThe Independent understands that the British military was not involved in the operation.\n\nBoris Johnson called Baghdadi\u2019s death \u201can important moment in our fight against terror\u201d but added: \u201cThe battle against the evil of Daesh is not yet over.\n\n\u201cWe will work with our coalition partners to bring an end to the murderous, barbaric activities of Daesh once and for all.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump has threatened to
