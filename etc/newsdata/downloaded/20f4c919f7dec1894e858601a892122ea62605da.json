His first words to Jessica were: \u2018You, me, forever.\u2019\n\nThe couple, who met in 2013 and got engaged in 2014, spent years planning their wedding.\n\nThe $10,000 event was set to take place in a local firehouse where Timothy worked as a volunteer firefighter.\n\nBut two days before the wedding, the engineer began behaving strangely.\n\nJessica, who works for a medical provider, said: \u2018Everything was going to plan then the day before our wedding rehearsal dinner, we were setting up the firehouse and Timothy kept falling asleep.\n\nTimothy was rushed to hospital the day before his planned wedding and needed urgent surgery on his brain (Picture: Jessica Berty /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018He had a really bad headache. He was falling asleep on the floor and on tables. He went home to sleep and the next morning, when I woke up, he wasn\u2019t in bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Timothy was in the living room, watching TV and he was talking gibberish.\n\n\u2018He thought he was speaking to me in sentences but he wasn\u2019t making any sense.\u2019\n\nJessica was so stressed out about the wedding planning that she didn\u2019t realise Timothy was ill.\n\nOn her way to meet her mum the day before the wedding, Jessica called Timothy\u2019s mother Amy to ask her to check on him.\n\nAn hour later Amy called Jessica to say that Timothy needed to go to hospital. Timothy was air-lifted to UPMC Presbyterean Hospital in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nFollowing surgery Timothy had to wear a hockey helmet to protect his brain as he was missing half his skull Picture: Jessica Berty /SWNS.COM)\n\nDoctors told Jessica that a sinus infection had spread to Timothy\u2019s brain and resulted in an abscess.\n\n\u2018He had a sinus infection but because he had a deviated septum it couldn\u2019t drain out,\u2019 Jessica said.\n\n\u2018It went up into his brain and his brain swelled. We sat in the hospital at 6.30 in the morning on what would have been our wedding day.\n\n\u2018The surgeon came in and asked to talk to him. But Timothy couldn\u2019t talk, he was grunting at this point.\n\n\u2018The surgeon told me he had to go to the ER as Timothy had an abscess on his brain.\u2019\n\nFollowing surgery Timothy was put in a medically induced coma for two days.\n\nThe family had to contact guests and tell them the wedding was off.\n\nThe couple have matching tattoos with the first words Timothy said when he came out of his coma: \u2018you, me, forever\u2019. (Picture: Jessica Berty /SWNS.COM)\n\nJessica said: \u2018We told everyone that they could still go to the firehouse as everything was set up, the food was there and the cake was there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Everyone said it was horrible and the weirdest wedding \u2013 the bride and groom and their parents weren\u2019t there. I expect it was very morbid.\n\n\u2018Timothy got out of surgery at one pm and our wedding was supposed to be at three.\u2019\n\nWhen Timothy woke up from his coma, he was upset to learn the wedding hadn\u2019t happened, and wanted to get married as soon as they could.\n\nOne week later they tied the knot in Timothy\u2019s hospital room.\n\n\u2018It was pretty much another regular day,\u2019 Jessica said.\n\n\u2018Timothy kept asking about us getting married.\n\n\u2018I messaged our friend Courtney Gondringer, 28, who is an ordained minister, and I asked her if she was free that night. She came over after work.\n\n\u2018The nurses got Timothy dressed because he was still hooked up to drains and tubes. My mom and I got dressed in the bathroom.\u2019\n\nTwo weeks later, after 23 days in hospital, Timothy was discharged and returned home where Jessica gave her new husband nightly feeds through a tube, sponge baths, and antibiotics twice a day.\n\nThe couple eventually got matching tattoos of the first words Timothy said when he came out of the coma: \u2018you, me, forever\u2019.\n\nTimothy said: \u2018I wanted us to get married as soon as we could. Jessica never left my side, she stuck with me, she was there the whole time. I truly knew that this was the girl that I needed to marry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was so frightening. It changed my perspective. I\u2019m not as active as I want to be but I am getting there.\n\n\u2018It feels great to be a married man. I am just happy that I found my perfect mate.\u2019\n\nDo you have a powerful wedding story to share?
