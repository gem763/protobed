There will more and more going forward from this time. I\u2019m sure some are being issued today. So we expect there will be a significant decrease in processing time for everybody,\u201d he told a joint hearing of the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nHe gave the clearest look yet at how Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial policy is operating two years after the current version was announced, imposing limits on citizens from eight countries to enter the U.S., based on security and terrorism concerns.\n\nMore than 72,000 people from travel ban countries have applied for visas since the inception of the policy. Of those, 7,679 had been granted waivers \u2014 half of them in just the last two months, as the new automated system kicked in, Mr. Ramotowski said.\n\nAnother 5,137 qualified for exceptions Mr. Trump wrote into his travel ban and didn\u2019t need waivers.\n\nSome 17,000 applicants are awaiting decisions, while nearly 13,000 were denied because of other aspects of immigration law. That leaves more than 30,000 who were denied waivers and excluded because of the travel ban.\n\nTo get a waiver, applicants must clear scrutiny of State Department consular officers, who rule on whether they have hardship or national interest claims that justify an exception, and then must clear an interagency security process.\n\nWaivers are at the crux of the travel ban.\n\nWhen a divided Supreme Court ruled last year that the travel ban policy was legal in principle, the justices said having a waiver was a key safety valve.\n\nThrough March of this year, 5% of those seeking waivers had been approved, including just 1.3% of those who applied for visas from Iran.\n\nImmigrant rights groups said that was proof the administration was slow-walking applications, effectively creating a secret travel ban even for those who should have qualified. Lawsuits are ongoing over individual cases.\n\nTrump administration officials told Congress, though, that the new system should speed up approvals. All applications pending as of July \u201cshould be completed by the end of 2019 or soon thereafter,\u201d Mr. Ramotowski said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was scheduled for the two-year mark since the current travel ban policy was issued. That Sept. 24, 2017, version was the third iteration, after the two previous ones were curtailed by the courts.\n\nThe current version covers seven countries. Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, all on the list, are majority-Muslim. Two others \u2014 Venezuela and North Korea \u2014 are not.\n\nOfficials said the countries are on the list because they refuse to cooperate with U.S. requests for travel information, leaving American officials without assurances that they can property vet citizens of those countries.\n\nThe State Department says it reviews the list every 180 days and lets the president know whether it should be updated.\n\nDemocrats, though, remain angry over the original version, which Mr. Trump announced just days after his inauguration and which applied to seven majority-Muslim countries. It took State Department and Homeland Security officials by surprise and created chaotic scenes at airports across the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim ban has not made us safer,\u201d said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat. \u201cIt has weakened our standing in the world and runs contrary to our country\u2019s moral and philosophical foundation.\u201d\n\nRepublicans countered that the countries on the list only make up 8% of the world\u2019s Muslim population, saying that undercuts the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d epithet.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
