There is no cure or vaccine for the deadly and highly contagious disease, which does not affect people.\n\nAs of July 1, the Philippine swine herd was estimated at 12.7 million head, including about 8 million pigs in backyard farms and 4.7 million in commercial farms, according to government data.\n\nThe Philippines has so far banned pork and pork-based products from more than a dozen countries, including Vietnam, Laos and China. In China, the outbreak has spread throughout every province and region of the mainland, as well as to Hong Kong and Hainan island.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Department of Agriculture has ordered the culling of thousands of hogs in areas where the disease had been detected.\n\nIt has also tightened animal quarantine and food safety measures, prohibiting the transport of live animals and meat products without health and shipping permits.\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 import ban covers pork and pork-based products from Germany, North Korea, Belgium, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Moldova, South Africa, Zambia, and Mongolia.\n\nIn China, the nation\u2019s pig herd shrank a third in July from the same month a year ago.", "description": "Dead pigs found in some backyard farms in the Philippines tested positive for African swine fever, the country's agriculture chief said on Monday, the first outbreak of the virus detected in the Southeast Asian country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
