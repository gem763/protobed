Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThe tweet was condemned by many Democratic politicians as well as Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who said it was \u201cbeyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nIt could also be grounds for impeachment, according to Harvard Law professor John Coates, who responded to the president\u2019s tweet with a little bit of constitutional law.\n\nThis tweet is itself an independent basis for impeachment - a sitting president threatening civil war if Congress exercises its constitutionally authorized power. https://t.co/JL9XzClGXf \u2014 John Coates\u26bd\ufe0f (@jciv) September 30, 2019\n\nSo far, no congressional lawmakers have commented publicly over whether Coates\u2019 legal opinion is a path worth pursuing.\n\nBut fellow Harvard Law faculty member Laurence Tribe did support the idea in theory \u2015 though he suggested it may not be practical.\n\nI agree with @jciv here, though this is far from the strongest ground for impeachment because it\u2019s much too easy to dismiss as typical Trumpian bloviating, not to be taken seriously OR literally. https://t.co/eyewzgBqL8 \u2014 Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) September 30, 2019\n\nCurrently, the House of Representatives is conducting an impeachment inquiry over whether the president withheld approved military aid to Ukraine unless the country\u2019s president investigated Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.", "description": "The president posted tweets Sunday quoting pastor Robert Jeffress,\u00a0who said the nation would suffer \u201ca Civil War-like fracture\" if Trump were removed fro...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d926b512400005f00d53372.jpeg?cache=khpkt2ewaz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
