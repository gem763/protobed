If you stripped off the majority of body fat from Andy Ruiz Jr, he wouldn't be that much higher than the cruiserweight division.\n\n\"If you put four stone of body fat onto Oleksandr Usyk, he'd still be a great fighter, but it wouldn't make him more of a heavyweight.\n\n\"So, I think Usyk shouldn't bulk up too much but, instead, use his speed and athleticism to become a success.\"", "description": "Usyk makes his heavyweight debut against Chazz Witherspoon after unifying the cruiserweight division", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Ed Mulholland Matchroom Boxing Usa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567070.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Boxing-Oleksandr-Usyk-vs-Chazz-Witherspoon-Weigh-In.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
