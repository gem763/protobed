Pictured, an artist's conception\n\nThe star, roughly the same size as our sun, was eventually sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence that astronomers call a tidal disruption event, they added.\n\nAstronomers used an international network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon on January 20 and then turned to TESS for more detailed analysis\n\nThe telescope's permanent viewing zones are designed to hunt distant planets and were repurposed to track the event after already looking in the same area of sky.\n\nThe event caused the temperature to drop by about 50 per cent, from 40,000\u00b0C to 20,000\u00b0C over just a few days.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time such an early temperature decrease has been seen in a tidal disruption before, although a few theories have predicted it, Holoien said.\n\n'This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward,' said astronomer Thomas Holoien of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who led the research.\n\nNASA released a video of images of a tidal disruption event called ASASSN-19bt taken by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Swift missions, as well as an animation showing how the event unfolded\n\nOn April 11, the world was stunned when the Event Horizon Telescope released the first ever image of a black hole. The image, somehow less detailed that the latest computer equivalent, captured radio observations of the heart of the galaxy M87 (pictured)\n\n'The early TESS data allow us to see light very close to the black hole, much closer than we've been able to see before,' said Patrick Vallely, a co-author and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at Ohio State University.\n\n'They also show us that ASASSN-19bt's rise in brightness was very smooth, which helps us tell that the event was a tidal disruption and not another type of outburst, like from the center of a galaxy or a supernova.'\n\nSuch cataclysmic event happens when a star ventures too close to a supermassive black hole.\n\nBlack holes reside at the centre of most large galaxies, including our Milky Way.\n\nThe black hole's tremendous gravitational forces tear the star to shreds, with some of its material tossed into space and the rest plunging into the black hole, forming a disk of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.\n\n'Specifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique,' Holoien said.\n\nThe full findings were published in the Astrophysical Journal.", "description": "Orbiting telescope TESS was used to track the destruction of the star as it got too close to the gravitational pull of the black hole and was destroyed.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/08/18999662-0-image-a-11_1569567959536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
