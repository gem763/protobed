Heads up safety move by a ramp worker! pic.twitter.com/SQi5zB0Ooz \u2014 Kevin Klauer DO, EJD (@Emergidoc) September 30, 2019\n\nThe semi-successful experiment in autonomous airport support vehicle technology happened at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport, at a gate occupied by an American Airlines Embraer 145 commuter jet. The catering cart, which appears to possibly be an EZ-Go or similar type of golf cart-style vehicle, modified for catering truck service, seems to have had its accelerator stuck, and to be left in reverse gear, sending it on backwards spirals of ever-increasing speed.\n\nManalang finally stopped the cart by ramming it with what appears to be a cargo-moving piece of equipment similar to a ride-on pallet jack. The impact toppled the rambunctious cart, and it\u2019s expected that American Airlines will put the machine down in a humane manner.\n\nAmerican released a statement about the event, saying\n\nNo American Airlines team members were injured and the incident resulted in one 10-minute flight delay. We appreciate the quick action of our team member who stopped the vehicle.\n\nA 10-minute delay isn\u2019t too bad, considering everyone on the plane got an exciting show. I just hope Jorge there gets a raise.", "description": "In troubled times, a nation needs heroes of all kinds to look to, and it appears we\u2019ve got one, Jorge Manalang, who took down an airport catering cart that went feral and started doing autonomous doughnuts, faster and faster, threatening to slam into workers on the tarmac or the aeroplane at the skyway.
