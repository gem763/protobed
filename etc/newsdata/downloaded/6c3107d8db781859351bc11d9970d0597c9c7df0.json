Local media reported that members of families who had been squatting in the building were digging in search of buried treasure \u2013 a widespread activity in Paraguay \u2013 when they made the discovery.\n\nMar\u00eda Stella C\u00e1ceres, director of the Museum of Memories \u2013 an institution dedicated to exhibiting the crimes of the Stroessner dictatorship \u2013 told the Guardian that it was extremely important to carefully verify whether the remains belong to victims of the regime.\n\n\u201cThe victims aren\u2019t just the people who disappeared, but their families and communities too. This is a crime against humanity that is ongoing and won\u2019t come to an end until the remains are found, identified and given back\u201d.\n\nRogelio Goibur\u00fa, head of the Paraguayan justice ministry\u2019s department for historical memory and reparation (DMHR), told the local television station C9N that investigations would take place to ascertain if the bones did indeed belong to victims of the dictatorship.\n\nGen Alfredo Stroessner oversaw the longest dictatorship in the modern history of South America, from a military coup in 1954\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bones found in the house of Alfredo Stroessner.

He died in exile in Brazil in 2006.\n\nStroessner\u2019s 35-year dictatorship was characterised by the violent oppression of opposition groups. These practices were revealed to the world in 1992, when about 700,000 documents created by the regime\u2019s security forces \u2013 which have come to be known as the \u201cArchives of Terror\u201d\u2013 were discovered in a locked room in a police station in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay\u2019s capital.\n\nItalian court jails 24 over South American Operation Condor Read more\n\nThese documents provided a record of the regime\u2019s routine use of persecution, kidnap and torture. They also yielded evidence of Paraguay\u2019s participation in the US-led Operation Condor \u2013 a programme that saw military dictatorships collaborate to violently suppress leftist opposition across South America.\n\nMembers of the political opposition were not the only victims of Stroessner\u2019s security forces. Paraguay\u2019s LGBT community was also heavily victimised. Goibur\u00fa, in conversation with C9N, mentioned that many members of indigenous community had been affected, as were hundreds of young girls groomed for sexual abuse by the regime.\n\nA report by Paraguay\u2019s Truth and Justice Commission states that, under Stroessner, at least 423 people were executed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d, 18,722 tortured and 3,470 forced into exile. The bodies of only 37 of those murdered by the dictatorship have been found to date, of which just four have been identified.\n\nA national campaign, Jajoheka Jajotopa, formed of victims\u2019 family members and human rights groups, continues to push for action to locate and identify those killed by Stroessner\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nBut activists say that the government of the current president, Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez \u2013 son of Stroessner\u2019s private secretary \u2013 has failed to adequately fund investigative work.\n\n\u201cNeither the current government, nor the one that preceded it, nor the one that preceded that has been concerned about the fate of those that disappeared,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Almada, the lawyer who uncovered the archives and recipient of the 2002 Right Livelihood Award.", "description": "Bones of an estimated four people found under bathroom of house that once belonged to Alfredo Stroessner", "authors": ["William Costa In Asunci\u00f3n"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f633465b8602c6254f6481e47acfb66001f76d/0_236_1171_701/master/1171.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff18f1d33a1674f479ea18f6d0162c8f", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
