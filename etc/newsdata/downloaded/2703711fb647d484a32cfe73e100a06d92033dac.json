Dr. Yasser Awaad worked at Oakwood Hospital, which now is part of Beaumont Health.\n\nLinzell was 4 years old when she was referred to Awaad in 2005. He said he had discovered abnormal brain activity during electroencephalograms. She was treated with an anti-seizure medication.\n\nBrian McKeen says the four tests were a \u201cfrightening experience\u201d for the girl, and the medicine made her anxious and impaired her learning.\n\nBut Awaad\u2019s attorney, Harry Sherbrook, says it\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d to accuse the doctor of intentional bad acts. Opening statements started Tuesday and will resume Wednesday.\n\nA jury awarded $3 million to another former patient after a June trial, but the amount was reduced by a judge to $846,000.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jurors are hearing opening statements in the second trial of a Detroit-area doctor who is accused of intentionally misreading tests to come up with epilepsy diagnoses in children.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
