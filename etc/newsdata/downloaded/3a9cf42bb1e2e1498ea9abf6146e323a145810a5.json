With the game tied and 12 seconds remaining at the snap, Justin McMillan rifled a pass through multiple defenders before Jalen McCleskey did the rest.\n\nMcCleskey caught the ball and stayed on his feet despite a stumble and broke free from the three defenders in the area for a 53-yard touchdown.\n\nTulane was only in position to win with the dramatics because of a fake kneel down that resulted in an 18-yard run from Amare Jones on the previous play.\n\nIt was only fitting that such a back-and-forth game ended in memorable fashion. Tulane marched 93 yards in 10 plays to tie the game late in the third quarter and then benefitted from a missed Houston field goal on the ensuing possession. The two sides then traded field goals before the Green Wave\u2019s head-turning final touchdown.\n\nMcMillan was just 7-of-20 passing for 186 yards, but he ran for 91 yards and a score. He also threw for three touchdowns and zero interceptions, while his counterpart, D\u2019Eriq King, had two touchdown throws and one pick to go with his 229 yards through the air.\n\nKing added 116 rushing yards and a touchdown, but it wasn\u2019t enough to counter Tulane\u2019s offense.\n\nThe Green Wave will look to keep the momentum rolling with a game against Army on Oct. 5, while Houston turns its attention toward a contest against North Texas on Sept. 28.", "description": "Green Waves don\u2019t play for overtime.
