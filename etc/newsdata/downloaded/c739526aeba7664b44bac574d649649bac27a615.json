We've said in the past that it is something that we would look at. I don't know if it's something Leo Varadkar would look but certainly if a time-limited backstop was on offer, it's something we would look at. But I don't believe it is at this present moment in time.\"\n\nMs Foster insisted that the DUP would strongly oppose any Brexit deal that would see Northern Ireland adopt different customs rules to the rest of the UK.\n\nShe said: \"We've been very, very clear that we have to leave on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom. We cannot have an internal customs border within the United Kingdom. It would just be anathema.\n\n\"It has constitutional implications as well as economic implications. When you think of the amount of trade we do east to west and west to east, it completely blows out of the water the north-south trade...\n\n\"Therefore customs [checks], from a constitutional point of view and from an economic point of view, do not work internally within the United Kingdom.\"\n\nShe added: \"You have to understand that the whole raison d'etre of the DUP is the union - it's the reason we get involved in politics, it's the reason that we stay involved in politics despite all the challenges that come to us in Northern Ireland. It's about keeping the union and talking about the benefits of the union.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He would be a disaster for Northern Ireland, he would be a disaster for the United Kingdom, both in terms of the economy and in terms of defence and security.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
