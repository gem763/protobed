A new rivalry is emerging, one which involves two teenagers at Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, and one which began six seasons ago \u2026\n\n\u2026 in Tokyo on August 30, 2013.\n\nThis was when FC Barcelona's Under-12 team had just swept Liverpool aside 5-0 at the Ajinomoto Stadium in the final of the Junior Soccer World Challenge.\n\nThe Barca youngsters, all part of the club's hallowed youth academy, \"La Masia\", walk proudly to collect their medals and lift the inaugural trophy.\n\nAmongst that line-up of gleaming faces were the tournament's top scorer \u2014 a towering young striker born in Guinea Bissau \u2014 and a slight, but skillful, Japanese playmaker, who had been the main provider of goals for his African peer.\n\nThe former was Anssumane \"Ansu\" Fati. The latter was Takefusa Kubo.\n\nThe pair, now in their late teens, have since been separated. While Fati remains with Barcelona, Kubo is with Real Madrid.\n\nBut while apart, the duo, now considered amongst the finest teenage talents in world soccer, still have their destinies intertwined \u2014 just not as team mates. As rivals.\n\nBorn on home soil \u2014 made in Spain\n\nAnsu Fati was born in Bissau, Guinea Bissau's capital city, but moved to Spain with his parents at the age of just six after his older brother, Braima, signed for Sevilla FC.\n\nIt didn't take long for young Ansu to follow in his sibling's footsteps, joining the same academy just two years later, before moving onto Barcelona shortly after in 2012, aged ten.\n\nKubo and Fati celebrate together with their teammates after winning the Junior Soccer World Challenge in 2013. Getty/Koji Watanabe\n\nLike Fati, Kubo also progressed from his home country to the heralded fields of the Camp Nou from an early age.\n\nKubo grew up playing for FC Persimmon in his birth town of Kawasaki, Japan, but started attending Barcelona Soccer Camps in 2009, aged eight. He quickly made a name for himself and was officially snapped up by the La Liga giant in 2011.\n\nHaving both arrived at La Masia at the same time, Fati and Kubo quickly developed a strong relationship on the field, scoring an unbelievable 130 goals between them during their first season together, according to FourFourTwo.\n\nNext season, the pair's symbiosis continued, helping their side top its division.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, however\n\nWhile Fati remained at La Masia, Kubo was forced out of Barcelona in 2015, after the club was found to be in breach of FIFA's newly implemented rule on signing international players under the age of 18.\n\nNow ineligible, by no fault of his own, to play for the Spanish giant, Kubo made his way back home to Japan to sign for FC Tokyo.\n\n\"In the end of my stage in Bar\u00e7a I had a bad time,\" Kubo told reporters at a press conference earlier this year, according to FCBN.\n\n\"Although I could not play, I had to go to see the games, and saw my mates playing and winning, but I could not be totally happy. So when I went back to Japan and could go back to play, I really felt very happy.\"\n\nRead more: Jadon Sancho, a 19-year-old who has been compared to Neymar, is now worth far more than the declining Paris Saint-Germain super forward\n\nMoving back home proved to be good move for Kubo, as he received the game time and freedom to fully establish himself as the continent's brightest young talent.\n\nIn April 2017, he scored his first professional goal for FC Tokyo aged 15 years and 10 months, hitting the winner in a 1-0 victory over Cerezo Osaka Under-23s. He was promoted to the club's first team six months later, and over the next two seasons made 18 appearances in the Japanese top flight, scoring five goals and registering four assists, according to Transfermarkt.\n\nAnsu Fati and Takefusa Kubo in action for Barcelona and Real Madrid. Getty\n\nWhile Kubo was making a name for himself in Japan, Fati was finding himself frustrated at Barcelona. The Bissau-Guinean had to sit out from the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons thanks for the same ban which forced Kubo to leave, as well as injuries to both his tibia and fibula, says FourFourTwo.\n\nFortunately however, Fati had shown more than enough promise in his early days at the club to warrant his stay in Spain, and the club's faith was repaid over the following three seasons as he continued to shine for Bar\u00e7a's Juvenil B and Juvenil A sides \u2014 the latter for whom he finished as top scorer last year.\n\nA reunion long in the making\n\nKubo's form in Japan earned him a move back to Europe in June 2019, this time with Real Madrid, who brought him back to Spain ahead of Barcelona, reports AS.\n\nAfter impressing in preseason for Madrid, he joined RCD Mallorca on a season-long loan, where he's already established himself as a regular starter in Vicente Moreno's side, making four appearances and grabbing one assist.\n\nRead more: Cristiano Ronaldo once dreamed of being the world's best soccer player.
