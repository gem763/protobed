I am glad to see the results of our expansion strategy, with emblematic events such as Kenya and Japan coming back to the WRC calender next year,\" FIA Rally Director Yves Matton said in a statement.\n\n\"Following the integration of Chile last year, the 2020 calender also expands our presence on both the Asian and African continents.\"\n\nAcross the savannah\n\nThe Safari rally was started as an East African competition between Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to celebrate the coronation of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\n\nConsidered one of the world's toughest rallies, covering over 1 000km across rugged east African savannah, the competition attracted top overseas drivers.\n\nPast winners included Britain's Colin McRae, Spaniard Carlos Sainz, Juha Kankkunen and Ari Vatanen of Finland.\n\n\"The Safari holds iconic status across East Africa, with fans from countries like Uganda and Tanzania as enthusiastic about the rally as those from Kenya itself,\" WRC Promoter managing director Oliver Ciesla said on the championship's website.\n\n\"Its heritage will be recalled by all, but at the same time this is a modern-era Safari that sits comfortably alongside our other 13 rounds.\n\n\"That doesn't mean its challenge is diminished and we can be sure 2020's version will test our drivers, teams and cars to the full,\" he added.\n\nThe Kenyan rally will be held between July 16-19, 2020.", "description": "Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday hailed a decision by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) to include the country's fabled Safari Rally in the world championships from next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7207/201af706f6f6416eb043e796d54a31df.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
