Bones also sometimes emerge because of above-ground burial niches and the tradition of cleaning grave sites for reuse after a few decades.", "description": "A raid by hundreds of police on a labyrinthine Mexico City slum complex last week yielded the skulls, two meth labs, guns, grenades and over 2 tons of marijuana.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4265434/1000x563_nbc-nbcnews_default.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
