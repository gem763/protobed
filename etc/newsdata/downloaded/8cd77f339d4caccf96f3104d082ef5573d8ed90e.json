They\u2019re no angels. Go back and take a look,\u201d Trump said as he sat alongside Italian President Sergio Mattarella, whom the White House was hosting for a visit Wednesday. Trump insisted that the Kurds would be fine because they \u201cknow how to fight.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand they can play with,\u201d Trump said of the region. \u201cIt\u2019s possibly never going to be very stable.\u201d\n\nAt a later news conference with Mattarella, Trump said the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or the PKK \u2014 a militant group that has regularly launched attacks inside Turkey in the name of Kurdish nationalism \u2014 was respected by the Islamic State \u201cbecause they\u2019re as tough, or tougher than ISIS.\u201d Trump was using another name for the Islamic State.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments Wednesday continued the mixed messages from the administration on the situation in Syria, even as Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to depart Wednesday for Ankara to try to negotiate an immediate cease-fire with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAD\n\nIn public remarks Monday, administration officials also took a harder line with Turkey than Trump, muddying the United States\u2019s message on the hostilities in northern Syria.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive into northeast Syria is undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS, endangering innocent civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\u201d Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday in New York. \u201cWe have made it clear with Turkey that any actions in northeast Syria in violation of international law, including international humanitarian law, are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe House adopted a resolution in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote that rebuked Trump\u2019s move to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria \u2014 a decision announced Oct. 6 that has found few defenders on Capitol Hill. The vote was 354 to 60 with three Republicans and independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) voting present.\n\nAD\n\nAll members of the House GOP leadership team were among the 129 Republicans who supported the resolution. A few notable Republican members opposed it, including the leaders of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus; Rep. Tom Reed (N.Y.), co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus; and Rep. Greg Pence (Ind.), the vice president\u2019s brother.\n\nAD\n\nThe House strategy is meant to force Trump to sign or veto legislation that scolded his own decision, although Senate Republican leaders have yet to publicly commit to taking up that bill.\n\n\u201cAlliances and values are important,\u201d said Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) speaking out on the House floor. \u201cWalking away from friends is a sad indication of policy that we don't want to support, we don't want to condone. Yes, we want America to be great, but we're also great because of our friends and our allies. Coalitions are not bad. Coalitions strengthen our public policy around the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s words drew criticism from prominent GOP voices, who continued to condemn his decision to withdraw the troops.\n\n\u201cTo have the vice president and the secretary of state going to meet with Erdogan and suggesting that somehow we\u2019re surprised by what\u2019s happening is disingenuous,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee. \u201cVery clearly it was a decision by the administration which has led to what you\u2019re seeing. This is a bit like the farmer locking the barn door after the horses left.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Trump\u2019s insistence that the Kurds were \u201cno angels,\u201d Romney responded: \u201cOh my goodness gracious, they are our friends, they have been our ally, and abandoning them was a very dark moment in American history.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), otherwise a stalwart Trump ally who has departed from the president dramatically on his actions in Syria, said Trump\u2019s comments Wednesday \u201ccompletely undercut\u201d Pence and Pompeo\u2019s ability to reach a cease-fire.\n\n\u201cI hope President Trump is right in his belief that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is of no concern to us, abandoning the Kurds won\u2019t come back to haunt us, ISIS won\u2019t reemerge, and Iran will not fill the vacuum created by this decision,\u201d Graham said Wednesday. \u201cHowever, I firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The president\u2019s comments provoked a fresh round of criticism from congressional Republicans who say Trump\u2019s decision allowed the Turkish incursion.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eePUM8xoJ9eXDNYK2bzoQEc9egE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RWMUYDHQIAI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
