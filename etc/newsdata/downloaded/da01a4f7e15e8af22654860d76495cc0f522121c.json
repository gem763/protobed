It irrigates the palm trees that line the immaculate streets and the grass field at the 5,000-seat sports stadium. Even the community swimming pools are filled with hundreds of thousands of gallons of it.\n\nDesalination provides all of the university\u2019s fresh water, nearly five million gallons a day. But that amount is just a tiny fraction of Saudi Arabia\u2019s total production. Beyond the walls and security checkpoints of the university, desalinated water makes up about half of the fresh water supply in this nation of 33 million people, one of the most water-starved on Earth.\n\nWorldwide, desalination is increasingly seen as one possible answer to problems of water quantity and quality that will worsen with global population growth and the extreme heat and prolonged drought linked to climate change.", "description": "As more places face a scarcity of fresh water, desalination is seen as a possible answer.\u00a0 But energy and financial requirements limit how widely it can be used.", "authors": ["Henry Fountain", "Jamie Mcgregor Smith", "Photographs By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/science/22CLI-DESALINATION-Fader-2/22CLI-DESALINATION-Fader-2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
