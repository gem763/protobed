That work concluded it is possible to interpret yes-or-no answers from the brain waves of fully paralyzed patients with \u201clocked-in syndrome\u201d due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, aka Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease).\n\nThe 2013-2014 work was published in 2017 in PLOS Biology and covered by Ars . The researchers subsequently published a response to criticism of the work in 2019 in PLOS Biology, which was also included in the DFG\u2019s misconduct investigation.\n\nIn a statement, the DFG said that it determined that German neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer, the coordinating researcher on the work, and first-author Ujwal Chaudhary, a member of Birbaumer\u2019s team, included incorrect information in three cases, did not completely record patient examinations by video as they reported, and failed to provide full data on patients.\n\nBirbaumer and Chaudhary hold positions at the University of T\u00fcbingen in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, and the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe DFG opened its investigation in 2018 after whistleblower Martin Sp\u00fcler, at the time a postdoctoral researcher at the University of T\u00fcbingen, said that he could not replicate the researchers\u2019 findings when he reanalyzed their data. An independent expert commissioned by the DFG as well as two other whistleblowers subsequently said that they too could not replicate the findings.\n\nAn independent investigation at the University of T\u00fcbingen likewise concluded in June that the researchers committed scientific misconduct. The investigation found evidence of selective data collection, missing and incomplete data, and possible data corruption due to flawed analysis.\n\nIn statements to Nature, Birbaumer said he accepted the investigations findings but that he stands by the work, which he say still shows \u201cthat it is possible to communicate with patients who are completely paralyzed, through computer-based analysis of blood flow and brain currents.\u201d\n\nThe DFG noted in its statement that the investigators did not draw any conclusions on whether the researchers\u2019 approach is valid.\n\nNevertheless, the DFG and the University of T\u00fcbingen both recommended that PLOS Biology retract both papers.\n\nWith its finding of misconduct, the DFG issues sanctions against Birbaumer and Chaudhary. Birbaumer is barred from applying for DFG grants and serving as a scientific evaluator for five years. He must also return the grant money DFG awarded him for the project. Chaudhary is barred from applying for grants and acting as an evaluator for three years.", "description": "The work claimed it was possible to interpret yes-or-no answers from brain waves.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-01-at-1.25.31-PM-760x380.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
