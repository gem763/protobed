A very bad move :( #saveBGMT,\u2019 one wrote.\n\nWhile another was worried about their rapping fix and added: \u2018Ok but like I can\u2019t go without Stephens raps every year don\u2019t let this happen #SaveBGMT\u2019\n\nMore: Britain's Got Talent BGT: The Champions winners Twist and Pulse reveal how they plan to spend \u00a3100K prize Britain's Got Talent's Twist And Pulse call on Little Mix for epic collaboration Simon Cowell keeps up the health streak as celebrates 60 with birthday bike ride\n\n\u2018Stephen and the crew are brilliant. moving it online would be a huge mistake. it works too well as a TV format for it to even be considered to go online only,\u2019 said a third, adding: \u2018Simon cowell\u2019s just worried as the main show is going downhill the same way as the x factor. #SaveBGMT\u2019\n\n\u2018BGMT is one of the funniest shows on TV, it genuinely makes me laugh out loud. I often look forward to it more than the main show,\u2019 another added.\n\n\u2018Given its success, I can\u2019t understand the decision to axe it. I am gutted #SaveBGMT\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent returns in 2020 on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
