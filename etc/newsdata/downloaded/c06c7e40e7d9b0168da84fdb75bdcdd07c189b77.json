Brown and Lucas Hedges Team Up to Make You Weep", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s like Sterling K. Brown has made it his mission to make us weep. This Is Us? We\u2019re sobbing. Black Panther? Tears! Even his guest spot on Brooklyn Nine-Nine had us cry-laughing. And the new trailer for Waves, which is set to play at the Toronto International Film Festival next week, is no different. Brown stars as an overbearing patriarch to a family dealing with loss. His kids, played by Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Taylor Russell, have their own lives, with love interests played by Alexa Demie and another king of crying, Lucas Hedges. What plays out in the trailer (under Frank Ocean\u2019s crooning) is beautiful and heart-wrenching and likely close to home. Waves will be set to music and paired with \u201ciconic contemporary songs.\u201d It was written and directed by Trey Edward Shults (It Comes at Night) and also features Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry. Find it in theaters this November.\n\nRelated", "description": "Sterling K. Brown stars in the new \u2018Waves\u2019 trailer.
