The deadline for his remains to be exhumed and moved to a new location is Friday.\n\nBut why were there calls for Franco's remains to be moved in the first place? And why has the issue proved so controversial?\n\nFranco ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. He was buried in a mausoleum called the Valley of the Fallen, just outside Madrid.\n\nBut that site has become a shrine for the far right and is loathed by many Spaniards.\n\nSpain's Socialist government wants to move Franco's remains to a less controversial site.\n\nBut that plan is opposed by Franco's family and his far-right supporters. Last month, the country's top court rejected an appeal from the family and backed the government's plan.\n\nFranco's remains are now set to be exhumed and reburied next to his wife at the El Pardo cemetery, north of Madrid.\n\nFranco won Spain's 1930s civil war, which was started when he rebelled against the elected leftist government.\n\nHe established a dictatorship and proclaimed himself head of state. He maintained a tight grip on power until his death in 1975, after which Spain transitioned to democracy.\n\nDemocracy is well established now, but the Franco era still haunts Spain. There was an unwritten \"pact of forgetting\" during the democratic transition and statues of Franco were removed and streets were renamed.\n\nHis embalmed body currently lies at the huge Valley of the Fallen mausoleum alongside tens of thousands of victims from both sides of the civil war.\n\nBut the site is reviled by many Spaniards who see it as a place dedicated to the victory of Franco's nationalist forces over their Republican opponents. It was also partly built by political prisoners, whom Franco's regime subjected to forced labour.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands of victims of the civil war are buried in mass graves at the Valley of the Fallen\n\nThe site is a shrine for Spain's far right who pay homage to the dictator there. It is often where Franco's supporters gather to mark the anniversary of his death.\n\nBut Spain's socialist government, in power since last June, made removing Franco's remains one of its key promises.\n\nIt wants the Valley of the Fallen to become \"a place of commemoration, remembrance and homage to the victims of the war\". It sees the presence of Franco's remains there as an affront to a mature democracy.\n\nMany descendants of Franco's victims support the plan to bury his remains elsewhere. But the issue has largely split public opinion across Spain.\n\nLast August, despite objections from his family and the right-wing People's and Citizens parties, the government approved the exhumation. It wanted to find a more low-key burial place where the dictator's followers would find it harder to pay tribute.\n\nBut Franco's family (who would rather he wasn't moved at all) said he should lie in a family crypt in the Almudena Cathedral - right in the centre of Madrid.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Franco's tomb is a pilgrimage site for Spanish fascists today\n\nThe government argued that the former dictator should not be placed anywhere he could be glorified.\n\nIt also said there were potential security issues with the cathedral site. As it is a Catholic church, the Vatican also weighed in and backed the government's search for an alternative location.\n\nThen, last month, an appeal by Franco's family against the exhumation was thrown out by the Supreme Court. It unanimously backed the government's plan to move his remains.\n\nThe government wanted to carry it out before elections on 10 November and so a deadline - 25 October - was set for the exhumation.\n\nIt plans to put him next to his wife in the El Pardo cemetery north of Madrid, where various other politicians are interred.\n\nThe Franco family will be given 48 hours' notice ahead of the exhumation in case they want to attend, the government says.\n\nFrancisco Franco, 1892-1975\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBorn in Galicia to a military family, became the youngest general in Spain in the 1920s\n\nFollowing the election of the leftist Popular Front in 1936, Franco and other generals launched a revolt, which sparked the three-year civil war\n\nHelped by Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy, Franco won the war in 1939 and established a dictatorship, proclaiming himself head of state - \"El Caudillo\"\n\nFranco kept a tight grip on power until his death in 1975, after which Spain made a transition to democracy\n\nRead more on Franco's legacy:", "description": "Franco's burial site has long been the subject of debate.
