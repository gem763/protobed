The Nets should have known this, whether it was Irving talking flat-earth silliness or going an entire practice without talking to teammates. They know the stories.\n\nIn a deep-dive piece by ESPN about the Nets' culture and their efforts to reshape the team with the inclusion of close friends and two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, Irving and DeAndre Jordan, Irving was depicted as a moody star prone to alienating teammates, coaches and management. The section on Irving was lower in the story and not the main focus.\n\nNets general manager Sean Marks and other Nets officials were not quoted directly on Irving's behavior.\n\nStill, it's unusual that Nets officials shared with ESPN that Irving had an incident when he lapsed into a funk during the team\u2019s trip to China. Jackie MacMullan reported that \u201cIrving's infamous mood swings, confirmed by his ex-teammates, which followed him from Cleveland to Boston to Brooklyn, are the unspoken concern that makes Nets officials queasy.\u201d\n\nMacMullan also reported that the incident in China left \u201ceveryone scratching their heads as to what precipitated it.\u201d\n\nThe Nets are four months into their relationship with Irving and one week into the regular season and I\u2019m left scratching my head, trying to understand why Nets officials felt compelled to share that information. There were also details from a team function where Irving refused to follow a photographer\u2019s request to remove his hat.\n\nAre the Nets trying to alienate Irving just a fraction into his four-year contract worth $136.4 million? Why wouldn\u2019t they keep this information private while trying to understand Irving? It was bad form for the Nets to make that public this early. It's not like Irving has been there two or three seasons and the Nets are tired of him.\n\nNets coach Kenny Atkinson tried to extinguish the fire following Tuesday\u2019s practice, telling reporters, \u201cThat (story) is completely false in my, strictly speaking, observation, my experience with him so far. It\u2019s absolutely not true.\n\n\"I say I\u2019m the moody one. I really am. I\u2019m cranky, and I have my ups and downs. If there\u2019s just natural human behavior where guys are up and down, that\u2019s different. From my perspective, I just give Kyrie an A-plus on his consistency and his spirit. It\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nIrving sometimes perplexed former teammates, including LeBron James who said after Irving left the Cavaliers, \u201cI had a little dialogue with him when I heard that he wanted to be traded, but since then I haven\u2019t. You guys know Kyrie, so, next question.\u201d\n\nWe all know his time in Boston the previous two seasons didn\u2019t work out as expected, and Irving took responsibility.\n\nI\u2019ve known Irving since the conclusion of his freshman season at Duke and found that \u2013 like all of us \u2013 he can be many things: quiet, talkative, standoffish, engaging, insightful, caring, inquisitive. And yes, Irving goes on tangents sometimes that make it easy for people to poke fun, at least on social media, at his quirks.\n\nDurant also defended Irving in the story.\n\n\u201cI look at Kyrie as somebody who is an artist,\" Durant told MacMullan. \"You have to leave him alone. You know what he'll bring to the table every night because he cares so much about the game.\n\n\"Now, it might not be how other people want him to care about it. He has his way of doing things. I respect who he is and what he does. He has all the intangibles you want in a teammate and a great player. So, how he gets to the point to be ready for 7:30 every night, I'm supporting him 100%.\"\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s practice, Jordan also had Irving\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cI think that Kyrie\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Jordan told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything negative that I\u2019ve seen that he\u2019s done. And he\u2019s a friend of mine, so if it was, I would tell him.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "Are the Brooklyn Nets trying to alienate All-Star guard Kyrie Irving just a fraction into his four-year contract worth $136.4 million?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/USAT/d7f8e909-dbe6-4cf9-95a6-04301f09ec5e-Kyrie_Irving1.JPG?crop=2977,2233,x913,y5&width=2977&height=2206&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
