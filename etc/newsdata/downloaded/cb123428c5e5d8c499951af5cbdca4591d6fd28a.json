Pussybows and flares were in full swing, as were silver hoop earrings the circumference of saucers. There were black and white spots peppered over silk blouses, scarves and cowl-neck dresses with thigh-high slits. Hats appeared many guises, from the wide-brimmed one worn by the Ashley Graham to Winnie Harlow\u2019s black and white houndstooth print baker boy-style cap.\n\nThat 70s show: why the disco decade is back in fashion Read more\n\nVelvet, leather, leopard print and faux snakeskin came in black, white and deep burgundies, choreographed into coordinated outfits. In the second part of the show, the clothes \u2013 and the moves \u2013 turned up the volume with metallic flares, dresses, halter-neck jumpsuits and suits.\n\nIn notes that Hilfiger sent to guests before the show, the collaboration was described as putting \u201credefined power dressing at its core\u201d. The designer explained further: \u201cWe wanted to celebrate and champion female empowerment through fashion.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A belted oversized coat with clashing prints.

It was hip-hop culture that helped Hilfiger achieve international success.\n\nWith their first collection, he and Zendaya made headlines with a Paris show in which 59 black models, aged 18 to 70, walked and Grace Jones performed. This show, with a roster of models that included Halima Aden, the 67-year-old Harlem native JoAni Johnson and Alek Wek, continued the theme of inclusion, chiming with the long overdue push for greater diversity in fashion in general, and this fashion week in particular.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tommy Hilfiger, Zendaya and Law Roach at the Apollo.

For the past three years, since adopting the see-now, buy-now model, which cuts the time customers have to wait to buy clothes from six months to seconds, it has been on a #TommyNow worldwide tour, Zendaya picking up the baton after the supermodel Gigi Hadid\u2019s four-collection collaboration.\n\nThe business model seems to be making sense commercially. Although cashing in on instant gratification, as many brands are now opting to do, could be seen as a controversial move at a time when consumers are being encouraged to make their fashion choices more conscious and sustainable.\n\nThe show fits with the current emphasis on experience over the static catwalk mould: a cinematic set was made to look like a block party, complete with brownstone steps, parked classic cars and snatches of city life, from sirens to rattling trains, made into an opening soundtrack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tommy Hilfiger and Zendaya are flanked by models including Winnie Harlow, Halima Aden and Ebonee Davis outside the Apollo.

With Hadid, Hilfiger put on two mammoth fashion shows, one a \u201crock circus\u201d at the Roundhouse performance space in north London, the other a fairground in Los Angeles.\n\nCollaborations with pop culture icons are also a smart move. \u201cThey have always been an important part of our heritage,\u201d said Hilfiger. \u201cEach collaborator sees our brand through a different lens which allows us to translate our values in new and exciting ways.\u201d", "description": "Flares in full swing for designer\u2019s hoop earring-adorned, 70s-themed collection", "authors": ["Ellie Violet Bramley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02728c31bd10fec9935f19278b81dde567134817/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8119f386afb1f520b37b55c514685e81", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
