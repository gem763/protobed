He knows me as a winger, so attacking-wise he\u2019s helped my game a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Defensively, I go to someone else to help me because they\u2019re two different styles that I have to play. Him personally, he\u2019s pulled me to the side a lot and has shown me different techniques and ways of beating players, ways of crossing the ball and shooting.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s helping me and I\u2019m happy to have him around because he\u2019s such a big figure in the team.\u2019\n\nAs well as helping Maitland-Niles on the training pitch, Ljungberg has also been credited with assisting Joe Willock and Bukayo Saka\u2019s development during his role with Arsenal U23s last season.\n\nSpeaking last month, Emery praised the impact Ljungberg has had on the squad, saying: \u2018He knows Arsenal perfectly, the young players, he helps us every day in training, the matches and before.\n\n\u2018He knows the characteristics of the Premier League. I\u2019m very happy with him. Each assistant has their work. We are together to speak with the players. We are in the dressing room, we spoke about all the situations individually. We share some moments.\u2019\n\nMaitland-Niles has been heavily involved for Arsenal in the opening weeks of the campaign, starting six of the club\u2019s eight Premier League matches although he faces competition at right-back from Calum Chambers and fit-again Hector Bellerin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe England U21 international defended himself from criticism of his form earlier this season by suggesting that Emery is playing him out of position after he came through Arsenal\u2019s academy as a box-to-box midfielder.", "description": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles is full of praise for Freddie Ljungberg's training methods and believes that Arsenal's assistant first-team coach has improved the attacking side of his game.
