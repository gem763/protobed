The company has since filed for bankruptcy protection in the face of billions of dollars in liability claims.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPG&E was among the last of the state\u2019s utilities to use the \u201cpublic safety power shutoff,\u201d as the planned outages are known. Power companies here have the right to shut off electricity when the wind, temperature and humidity align to create high-risk fire conditions, although such decisions are reviewed by the California Public Utilities Commission.\n\n\u201cWe know how much our customers rely on electric service and the impacts these events can have on them, their families, businesses, and communities \u2014 including the use of medical equipment and refrigeration,\u201d PG&E wrote in a report to the commission last month on its use of power shut-offs. \u201cWe will only consider proactively turning off power when the benefits of de-energization outweigh potential public safety risks.\u201d\n\nBut there is also an element of political negotiation in the shut-offs, which in this case was explained by PG&E as the result of the stiff, dry winds expected to whip up overnight here and which, in the past, have been the driving force behind the state\u2019s worst fires.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Northern California the wind, which blows warm from the northeast, is known as a Diablo. Forecasts for late this week call for gusts as strong as 45 mph.\n\nPG&E has sought in recent years to loosen California\u2019s liability standards, which hold utilities liable for any damage caused by fires started by its equipment, whether the company is found negligent or not. The principle, known as \u201cinverse condemnation,\u201d is among the strictest in the nation.\n\nDespite heavy lobbying by the utilities, California lawmakers had refused to change that standard in recent legislative sessions. But this year lawmakers loosened it slightly to allow a lower liability threshold for utilities that first complete billions of dollars in safety improvements to power lines, transformers and other equipment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen the power goes out, it\u2019s fun to sit around and fantasize about the many ways you will oppose any legislation or initiatives that are favorable towards PG&E,\u201d wrote John Holland, a Berkeley, Calif., resident facing the prospect of a power shutdown, in a Tuesday afternoon tweet.\n\nAD\n\nPG&E has 16 million customers, the majority of them in Northern California. The company has begun a campaign of television advertising concerning fire safety. The spots include animated illustrations of how to create \u201cdefensible spaces\u201d around homes, jargon that has gradually crept into California\u2019s daily conversation.\n\nAcross the state, neighborhoods organize meetings to gather information about which residents would need extra help during intentional power shut-offs, who has generators, and whose medical issues would be exacerbated by a blackout.\n\nAD\n\nThis shutdown may affect about 800,000 customers who live in a crescent around San Francisco, residents of the state capital, Sacramento, and much of California wine country. The northern Sierra Nevada also falls within the planned shut-off area.\n\nAD\n\nUtilities attempt to give a 48-hour warning before a planned power outage, allowing customers some time to prepare for what could be a long time without electricity. The extent of this outage, the utility has warned, could mean that it will take days to turn the power back on across the affected area once the winds have calmed and temperatures cooled.\n\nPower shut-off warnings take a worst-case approach initially, and as it nears, the area affected often shrinks. In this case, the opposite occurred as wind forecasts changed to show the Diablo starting earlier and blowing more broadly. PG&E extended the area where conditions might prompt it to turn off the power, including in Marin County just north of San Francisco.\n\nAD\n\nEven short-lived outages have proven onerous \u2014 and expensive \u2014 to state residents. In rural California, already butchered meat, grapes and avocados, among other products, have spoiled without refrigeration during recent power shut-offs and emergency generators are costly to buy and run. They also pose a fire risk.\n\nHere in Oakland, a city whose hills burned in 1991, killing 25 people and destroying more than 2,800 homes, the sun set without a breath of wind.\n\nThe city falls within the planned shut-off area. But the evening was cool, if also dry, and the threat of fire remained undetectable.\n\nAD", "description": "Nearly 1 million California customers could lose power in a bid to prevent fires sparked by downed utility lines in high winds.", "authors": ["Scott Wilson", "Senior National Correspondent Focusing On California", "The West"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dS5GkLECCi1AgjoDTH-prYiNZgk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZESA2AXBLYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
