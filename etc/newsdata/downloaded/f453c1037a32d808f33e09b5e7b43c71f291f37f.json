He had a contact with a knee and felt something in the bone.\n\n\u2018They told me that after the international break maybe Rodri will be ready again.\u2019\n\nGuardiola has Benjamin Mendy, Angelino and Joao Cancelo to call on in Zinchenko\u2019s absence, but it is yet another injury blow for the Premier League champions.\n\nZinchenko 'felt something in his bone' and will be out for 'five to six weeks' said Guardiola\n\nCity are also nursing John Stones back to full fitness following a thigh injury and Guardiola maintained the central defender is still working his way back.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not about being first choice, it\u2019s about being fit,\u2019 the City boss added. \u2018He\u2019s had a long, long time with many injuries. Vinny (Kompany) and (Aymeric) Laporte were in incredible top form last season. This season (John is) injured and injured and injured sometimes it needs more time.\u2019\n\nRodri\u2019s injury may open the door for Phil Foden, who made his second start of the season in midweek.\n\nCity are also nursing John Stones back to full health following the defender's thigh injury\n\nFoden glistened in midfield before seeing red for two bookings. Ilkay Gundogan is likely to fill in for Rodri, which should give the academy graduate more opportunities.\n\n\u2018Every season he will be better. It is about time,\u2019 Guardiola said. \u2018When he\u2019s 23 he\u2019ll be better than now and 26 better than 23.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s an incredible worker, he\u2019s a fighter. The rest of the guys in the Under 23 side say the same - they all say they should play more and they are right. But it is what it is.\u2019", "description": "Pep Guardiola fears Oleksandr Zinchenko could be missing until December after undergoing knee surgery - while Rodri is likely to miss Manchester City's crunch clash against Liverpool.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20180864-0-image-a-13_1572009708723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
