Nobody was injured. (Radio-Canada)\n\nGood morning commuters!\n\nWatch out for those slippery leaves, cyclists. There's probably a lot of them down on the ground now.\n\nThere's a power outage in Hull this morning because of a fire on rue Wellington at about 2 a.m., meaning several traffic signals aren't working.\n\nThat includes major roads such as boulevard des Allumetti\u00e8res and rue Eddy.\n\nCrews said they expected it to be fixed by 8:30 a.m. at the latest, but now aren't saying when.\n\nThe fire has closed Wellington between rues Montcalm and Eddy and rue Saint-Redempteur between Wellington and rue Wright.\n\n(Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec)\n\nToday there will be turning lane closures at intersections on both the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway and Aviation Parkway.\n\nThe left turning lane of the eastbound Sir JAM at Island Park Drive will be closed between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. for catch basin repairs.\n\nThe right turning lane on the northbound Aviation Parkway at Montreal Road will close during the same time for asphalt repairs.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nIf you have a traffic or commuter gripe about driving, cycling or being a pedestrian commuter \u2014 anything from problem intersections, to parking, to inefficient routes \u2014 send it to doug.hempstead@cbc.ca.\n\nAnd remember, you can share what you see on the roads with me on Twitter at @cbcotttraffic. Or give me a ring at 613-288-6900.", "description": "Traffic lights are down on boulevard des Allumetti\u00e8res and rue Eddy because of a fire early this morning.", "authors": ["Cbc Ottawa'S Traffic Specialist", "Doug Hempstead Is Cbc Ottawa'S Traffic Specialist", "Can Be Heard On Cbc Radio'S Ottawa Morning", "All In A Day.
