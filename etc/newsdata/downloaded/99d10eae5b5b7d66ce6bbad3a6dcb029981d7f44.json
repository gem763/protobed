If you thought your parents were annoyed about purchasing you Taylor Swift concert tickets, let\u2019s all imagine their expression when they find out she only has four U.S. concert dates in 2020. Not pretty! Very serious about rerecording her albums in 2020, Swift is forgoing a Lover tour and simply throwing herself a music festival to save time. I hope she\u2019s ready for the Beyhive to say she\u2019s copying Beychella. The Swifties and Beyhive truly might thrust us into World War III for this one. Lover Fest West and Lover Fest East will take place at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and the Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts over two weekends, July 25\u201326 and July 31\u2013August 1. That means tickets to see Swift and her unannounced opening acts are gonna go fast. Taylor Swift Tix Verified Fans are able to RSVP today for Preferred Presale access. If you want to become a verified fan, registration will reopen on September 19 at 4 p.m. Eastern time. Everyone else can hunt during the public sale on October 14. Outside of the United States, Swift will be heading to eight countries: Belgium, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Poland, France, Portugal, and, yes, she is coming to Brazil. If you don\u2019t live in any of these cities or countries, oops, sorry! Santa Claus is going to get a lot of letters asking for a plane ticket to S\u00e3o Paulo this year.", "description": "Taylor Swift won\u2019t be taking her new album \u2018Lover\u2019 on tour in the United States.
