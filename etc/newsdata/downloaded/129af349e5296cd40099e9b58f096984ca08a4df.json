However, that is no excuse for me missing what may prove to be the biggest story of the year: Ivanka Trump getting a haircut. Yep, the first daughter chopped several inches off her locks earlier this month and is now sporting a shoulder-length bob.\n\nI have no idea how I missed this story, because it was everywhere last week \u2013 reaching an online audience of more than 1.4 billion people, according to an analysis by Critical Mention, a software company that tracks this sort of thing. Of course, online metrics should be taken with a pinch of salt; I doubt almost one in five people in the world read about Trump\u2019s new do. Nevertheless, an inordinate number of us appear to find the heiress\u2019s hair bizarrely captivating. The new cut has been analysed to within an inch of its life. The Daily Beast, for example, mused that it \u201ccould be an optics ploy to communicate control in a derailed administration\u201d. Salon asked whether the shorter cut was a \u201cnod to her growing ambitions\u201d, while an image consultant told Refinery29 that Trump \u201cwants to re-establish credibility because her father\u2019s campaign is coming up ... this hair makes her look more grounded and more mature and more professional.\u201d\n\nIt is possible Trump just felt like cutting her hair. But if the Trumps care about anything, it is image; I wouldn\u2019t dismiss the idea that Trump\u2019s new cut is an attempt to get us to take her politicking more seriously. Women\u2019s hair, after all, is tangled up in traditional ideas of femininity. There is a reason so many female politicians sport a short style known as the political bob (pob): it is less \u201cfeminine\u201d, which makes them seem more powerful. So be afraid, be very afraid: Trump\u2019s new do may well signify that she has ramped up her political ambitions. God help us all if she goes brunette.\n\n\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "If her family cares about anything, it is image.
