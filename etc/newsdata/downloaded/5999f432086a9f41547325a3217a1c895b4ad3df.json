You\u2019ll see headlines with \u201cf\u2014ing\u201d and self-help books with \u201cf*cked\u201d in the title. The emphasis here is usually on the word itself (theoretical edginess conferred by the edgy word), rather than context, timing, or creativity (the general art of cursing).\n\nThe d\u2014-ing approach ends up suggesting that we, the voters and readers, are secure enough in ourselves to hear Beto O\u2019Rourke say our state of affairs is fucked up, but simultaneously just dainty enough to be uncomfortable seeing the word spelled out in full.\n\nWho is this for, though? If you don\u2019t like cursing like this, it\u2019s hard to imagine one asterisk resolves the issue for you, like placing a paper napkin over a hole in the wall. Even if you like the cursing O\u2019Rourke, dashing out words on T-shirts would seem to push him right into \u201ccorporate attempts at edginess.\u201d (It\u2019s the *!#^ weekend; come on down to Buffalo Wild Wings.)", "description": "", "authors": ["Katherine Miller", "Buzzfeednews.Com Article Katherinemiller Beto-Orourke-Cursing"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
