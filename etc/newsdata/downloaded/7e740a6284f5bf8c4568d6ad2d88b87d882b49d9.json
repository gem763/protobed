A large number of riot police were deployed in different districts along the route of the march, with protesters taking over the main thoroughfare, bringing traffic to a standstill.\n\nOnlookers jeered and yelled obscenities at officers who wore black facemasks and did not show their police numbers.\n\nThe atmosphere became tense when a officer rushed up to a young couple who wore medical masks but were not part of the protest. \u201cTake off your bloody masks. Show your identity cards,\u201d he shouted. Another officer said: \u201cSee a doctor if you\u2019re ill.\u201d\n\nPassersby shouted back at police. One young father, holding his infant daughter, told them: \u201cBeware of what sort of a world you\u2019re creating for your own children.\u201d Several police officers rushed up to intimidate him.\n\nHis wife said through tears: \u201cWe\u2019re protesting today precisely because we have a child. If we don\u2019t speak up for others now, who will speak up for us?\u201d\n\nOutside Prince Edward metro station, people lit incense and paid their respects at a makeshift shrine decorated with white flowers. Many believed people died at the scene after being beaten by police in late August, and have accused the government of a cover-up.\n\nA 55-year-old man, who burst into tears after bowing in front of the shrine, said: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that people have died here \u2013 I have no trust in the government.\u201d\n\nA police officer shouted at and pointed a metal stick at the face of an elderly woman who was trying to mediate between him and an angry protester, leaving her trembling.\n\nMeanwhile, marchers vandalised two government offices and a coffee shop seen as being pro-Beijing, and a petrol bomb was thrown at the gate of a metro station not on the route of the protest.\n\nProtesters smashed glass and sprayed graffiti on the walls of the Kowloon and Cheung Sha Wan government offices. Police said the demonstrators also broke the gate, entered the buildings and started a fire.\n\nElsewhere, hundreds of masked protesters chanted slogans such as \u201cI have every right to wear a mask\u201d and sang the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong at a shopping centre in Sha Tin in the evening. Some had their faces painted while others played musical instruments.\n\nA 15-year-old student said: \u201cI can\u2019t refrain from wearing a mask just because of fear. We should resist an unjust law and an unjust regime.\u201d\n\nDozens of older people staged a sit-in protest outside the police headquarters to protest against the beating and arrests of people as young as 12. Hong Kong officials said one-third of the more than 2,200 protesters arrested during the four months of unrest were under 18.\n\nHong Kong police issued a statement condemning vandalism and unauthorised assembly.", "description": "Petrol bomb thrown at metro station and government offices vandalised as unrest continues", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e17b5bb32c0a75f2c8c568e1f128d68de185e7b0/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=356c28631e8f38be27f2214d2663cb55", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
