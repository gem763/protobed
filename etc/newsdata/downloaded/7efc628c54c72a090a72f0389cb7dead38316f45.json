She also said that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done on the project before it becomes something more than just an idea.\n\nPayPal Bullish on Libra\n\nEarlier this year, Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media website, announced its future cryptocurrency project called Libra. While it received mixed reactions from institutions and the community, in general, it remains one of the most widely discussed topics in the field.\n\nWeighing in on the matter was the investor relations vice president of PayPal, Gabrielle Rabinovitch.\n\nCommenting on Facebook\u2019s Libra, Rabinovitch said that it\u2019s a non-binding commitment and that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of work to happen before we get to that point where it becomes something more than just a very exciting idea.\u201d\n\nHowever, she also added that Libra\u2019s goals are pretty much in line with those of PayPal when it comes to banking the unbanked.\n\nThe goals and ambitions of Libra are very consistent with PayPal\u2019s overall ambitions in terms of serving the underserved; democratizing access to capital. \u2013 Said Rabinovitch.\n\nHence, she summed up PayPal\u2019s position on the matter by saying that they \u201cvery much believe in the potential of Libra.\u201d\n\nTough Times For Libra\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Libra and the Association behind it could use every word of endorsement it can get as times have certainly been better for the project.\n\nThe Independent recently reported that France\u2019s Economy and Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire said that the country plans to block the project in the EU over concerns that it actually brings a threat to the sovereignty of national currencies.\n\nJust yesterday, Sept. 13, a German weekly news outlet Spiegel also reported that Germany\u2019s head of blockchain policy of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Thomas Heilmann, said that the government will deny projects such as Facebook\u2019s Libra.\n\nYet, despite all of that, the social media giant pushes forward with the development of the project. According to Bertrand Perez, the general director of the Libra Association, they are on track to launch as scheduled at the end of 2020.\n\n\u2026 we are firmly maintaining our launch schedule, between the end of the first half of the year and the end of 2020. \u2013 Said Perez.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "The investor relations vice president of PayPal, one of the world\u2019s largest online payment processors, has said that Facebook\u2019s Libra are very consistent", "authors": ["George Georgiev", "View All Posts George Georgiev", "About The Author", "Georgi Georgiev Is A Seasoned Writer With Over Two Years Of Experience Writing About Blockchain", "Cryptocurrencies.
