I am concerned about the way we played.\n\n\"If we play the level we played in the second half we will be there at the end of the season. If we play the way we did in the first half, we will be relegated.\"", "description": "City reckon Brazilian striker's value has quadrupled with Guardiola viewing him as Aguero's successor", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734476.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_European-Best-Pictures-Of-The-Day-October-26-2019-Manchester-City-v-Aston-Villa-Premier-Leagu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
