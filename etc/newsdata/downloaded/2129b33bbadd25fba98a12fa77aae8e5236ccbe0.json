Haden was in the final year of a three-year deal he signed with Pittsburgh after being released by the Cleveland Browns on the eve of the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cLetssss Goooo!!!\u201d Haden posted on Instagram late Sunday night. \u201cSo glad we got the deal done! On to week 1! Locked IN!!\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old has resurrected his career with the Steelers, becoming the team\u2019s top cornerback while helping an inexperienced secondary find its footing. Haden has played 26 games across two seasons for Pittsburgh, with one interception and 19 passes defensed. He did not play in the preseason as a precaution due to an ankle injury.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowler said last week the injury would not prevent him from playing in Pittsburgh\u2019s season opener at New England on Sept. 8.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joe Haden is sticking with the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
