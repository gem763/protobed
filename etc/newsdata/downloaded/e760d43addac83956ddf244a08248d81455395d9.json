Turnout has been on a downward trend ever since the first ballot 40 years ago, with the perceived complexity of how things work in Brussels one frequently posited explanation. As part of a series outlining the form and functions of the key EU institutions, here we explain the role of the European Commission.\n\nWhat is the European Commission?\n\nThe European Commission is the politically independent executive body of the European Union. It proposes new European legislation, implements the decisions of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the bloc.\n\nEstablished in 1958, it is based in Brussels \u2013 where it has its headquarters at the Berlaymont building in the European Quarter \u2013 and Luxembourg, and has offices around the world.\n\nIt is led by a president and a team (or \"college\") of 28 commissioners, one from each EU member state, which meets each week. They are bound by oath to represent the interests of the EU as a whole, rather than those of their home country.\n\nThese commissioners are not directly elected, but rather proposed by the Council of the EU based on suggestions by the governments of each member state. They are then appointed upon the approval of the European Parliament.\n\nThe European Commission is the largest employer among the EU's institutions, with a staff of around 33,000. One-third work in Brussels, with Belgians making up around one-sixth of the total workforce.\n\nWhat does the Commission do?\n\nThe European Commission is responsible for proposing new EU laws to protect the interests of the Union and its citizens at a bloc-wide level, for adoption by the European Parliament and the European Council. It consults both experts and European citizens in order to draw up these proposals.\n\nThe Commission is responsible for the proper adherence to treaties and enforcement of EU law in member states, along with the European Court of Justice.\n\nIt also manages EU policies, and draws up annual budgets and allocates EU funding (in consultation with the Council and the Parliament) in order for these policies to be implemented. The Commission is also responsible for supervising how EU funding is spent once allocated, under the scrutiny of the Court of Auditors.\n\nThe Commission represents the EU at an international level, speaking on behalf of all its member states in matters of trade and humanitarian aid and negotiating international agreements.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Reuters\n\nWho is in charge?\n\nThe European Commission is headed up by a president, who leads the college of commissioners and appoints a portfolio to each, and reshuffles the cabinet or dismisses commissioners as necessary. The president's role also includes representing the EU abroad.\n\nThe president is elected by the European Parliament after the parliamentary elections, and after each member state has nominated a candidate, taking into account the election results. Parliament must approve the new president by a majority (at least half of MEPs plus one) and if this majority is not obtained, member states must propose another candidate within a month.\n\nThe Spitzenkandidat (German for \"Lead Candidate\") process was introduced by Parliament in 2014, by which each European political party sitting nominates its own presidential candidate prior to the parliamentary election. The nominee from the largest party after the election is then assumed to have the mandate for the presidency.\n\nREAD MORE: What is a spitzenkandidat and how does the process work?\n\nThe current and 12th president is former prime minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker, who is a member of the pro-European, centre-right European People's Party (EPP). Then UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n were the only members of the European Council to object to his appointment.\n\nJuncker's five-year tenure comes to an end with the European Parliament elections and his successor will be announced after that and will take office on 1 November, 2019.\n\nEU flags fly outside the Commission headquarters REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nWhat are the Commission's limits?\n\nThe Commission is tasked with proposing new legislation, but it cannot pass these laws on its own. This is done by the elected MEPs of the Parliament and the member state government representatives who make up the Council of the EU \u2013 for a law to be passed, it needs a majority in both.\n\nAnd while the Commission is responsible for the upholding of EU law in member states, it depends on public administration and agencies and national courts in the member states to carry this out. Adherence to EU law is also ultimately the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, which also scrutinises the Commission itself's adherence.\n\nThe Commission represents and negotiates for the bloc in international trade agreements, but the member states give, or withhold, their approval of any agreements proposed.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the EU's highest authority is the European Council and the Commission is answerable to it, and to the Parliament, given that they appoint the commissioners and elect the president. Parliament can also dismiss the Commission. None of the eight motions of censure brought so far have been adopted, but in 1999 the Santer Commission (under president Jacques Santer) resigned en masse before Parliament forced its resignation, due to allegations of corruption.\n\nThe Commission submits regular reports to Parliament, including an annual budget report, and is required to reply to questions from MEPs. EU accounts are also sent to the European Court of Auditors each year, which produces an annual report for examination by the Parliament in order for it to approve or disapprove the Commision's handling of the budget.\n\nSalaries, perks and working conditions for Commission staff are set by the Council of the EU and the Parliament.\n\nA climate change protester sprays 'Collapse' on a European Commission building Reuters\n\nWhat do the Commission's critics say?\n\nThe fact that members of the European Commission are not directly elected by the public has long made it the principal subject among the EU's institutions of Eurosceptic accusations of a \"democratic deficit\". This phrase was first used in relation to the EC in 1977 in the manifesto of the Young European Federalists, a political youth NGO which campaigns for a more democratic Europe.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nWhat does the European Parliament do?\n\nWhat does the European Council do?\n\nEuropean Parliament elections 2019: all you need to know", "description": "Ahead of the European Parliament election, we outline the functions of the different branches of the European Union.
