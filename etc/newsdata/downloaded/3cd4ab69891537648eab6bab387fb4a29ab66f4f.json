Biden\u2019s ability to finance a multistate primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.\n\n\u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?'\u201d said longtime Democrat, Leah Daughtry at the dinner hosted by the progressive group, American Bridge.\n\nHowever, Martin wrote the \u201cmood of alarm is even more intense because of the party\u2019s hunger to defeat President Trump and \u2014 with just over three months to go before voting starts in Iowa \u2014 their impatience with finding Mr. or Mrs. Right among the current crop of candidates.\u201d\n\nIn May, Breitbart News reported that Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said none of the current Democrat candidates could beat President Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf you look at why people voted for Donald Trump, in my opinion, first and foremost it was because he wasn\u2019t a politician,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are the least trusted of every profession.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Democrat presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) said he would exit the race unless his campaign could raise a significant amount of funds in the coming days.\n\n\u201c[T]his is a critical moment\u2014 if my campaign can\u2019t raise $800,000 by October 31st, my campaign will be silenced for good,\u201d he stated.\n\nHowever, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s (D-HI) campaign gained traction among potential voters this week after Hillary Clinton accused her of being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Russians to be a third-party candidate.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Monday in her defense.\n\nDespite the recent uptick in support for Gabbard, former Obama advisor David Axelrod said Democrats are still on the fence about which candidate might be able to keep Trump from winning a second term.\n\n\u201cWith Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "None of the current candidates seem to have what it takes to defeat President Trump in 2020, according to Democrat donors.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/anti-donald-trump-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
