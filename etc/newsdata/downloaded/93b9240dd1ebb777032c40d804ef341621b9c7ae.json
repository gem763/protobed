It was one of the biggest-money sales in gaming history.\n\nNaierman picked up about 40 factory-sealed Nintendo games in the million-dollar haul, all of which were assembled by three Denver-based collectors who took 52 years to amass them. In addition to the large size of the purchase, many of the games are believed to be the only copies in existence, or one of a few copies.\n\nThe games included 1986\u2019s Mario Bros. arcade version and the only known sealed copies of 1985\u2019s Golf, 1986\u2019s Balloon Fight and 1986\u2019s Gumshoe. According to the Post, \u201csome experts consider it to be one of the foremost collections in the world, both in terms of overall value and rarity.\u201d\n\nNaierman used to collect baseball cards, writes the Post, which added, \u201cIt took far too much money, he said, to buy a single card, and he was looking to form a collection that could rank as one of the best in the world.\u201d Naierman made the purchase with the help of a collector group that, in a creative twist, calls themselves the Video Game Club.\n\nKotaku has previously reported on how deep-pocketed collectors are fuelling a retro games gold rush.\n\nYou can read the full Washington Post story here.
