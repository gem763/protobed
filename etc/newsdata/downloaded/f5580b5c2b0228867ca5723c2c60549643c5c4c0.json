Bush at NFL Game: 'It's OK We're Different'", "language": "en", "text": "Click here to read the full article.\n\nFollowing an uproar on social media, Ellen DeGeneres wants to clear the air about the time she spent with President George W. Bush at a recent NFL game.\n\nOn Oct. 6, DeGeneres and the former POTUS were photographed at a Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers match-up, having been invited to watch the game from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 suite. The photo immediately drew criticism, which DeGeneres addressed on Tuesday\u2019s episode of her talk show.\n\nMore from TVLine\n\n\u201cPeople were upset. They thought, \u2018Why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2019 A lot of people were mad, and they did what people do when they\u2019re mad: They tweet,\u201d DeGeneres began.\n\nThe host then called out one tweet she did appreciate, which read, \u201cEllen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u201d As her studio audience cheered for the sentiment, DeGeneres responded, \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019re all different, and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re different\u2026 But just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nBut in the wake of Sunday\u2019s football game, critics called DeGeneres out for palling around with a politician who, among other things, actively tried to strip LGBTQ rights when he was in power.\n\n\u201cBush campaigned for reelection in 2004 largely on a promise for a constitutional amendment prohibiting marriage equality,\u201d the LGBTQ publication The Advocate noted, and \u201cpushed\u201d \u2014 ultimately unsuccessfully \u2014 \u201cfor such a change in his State of the Union address shortly after winning a second term.\u201d\n\nOut Magazine also published an article criticizing DeGeneres\u2019 time with Bush. \u201cAs one of America\u2019s most visible (and powerful) queer celebrities,\u201d Rose Dommu wrote, \u201cEllen pal\u2019ing around with those who have actively tried to harm us feels disappointing, irresponsible, and dangerous.\u201d\n\nWatch DeGeneres\u2019 full response below:\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nSign up for TVLine's Newsletter.
