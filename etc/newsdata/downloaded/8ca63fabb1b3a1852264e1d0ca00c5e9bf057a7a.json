Louise Kennerley\n\nThe highly paid executive presided over a total shareholder return of close to 60 per cent during the pay period.\n\nMr Goodman was this month named Australia's top CEO by the Havard Business Review for the second year in a row. Last year shareholders took issue with the pay of Goodman Group's top executives, giving the company a \"first strike\" with close to half of the votes going against the 2018 pay report.\n\nThe pay data analysed by The Australian Financial Review looked at the comparable executives in a list of the top 20 REITs, which excluded those that have not served over the last two full financial years, among other things.\n\nAmong the group, Stockland was the only company that reduced pay compared to the prior year for all key management staff.\n\nManaging director Mark Steinert received a haircut of 23.3 per cent, after a fall in performance-based incentives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's about ensuring that executives are aligned to the company and shareholders, and that executives are not unjustly enriched at the expense of the company and shareholders,\" BDO's head of remuneration Allan Feinberg said.\n\n\"Where you have a disconnect is at times where you have shareholders losing money, and executives still in a position where they are enriched.\"\n\nAdditional challenges\n\nFrom shareholders and their representatives assessing whether to support a remuneration report, there are additional challenges for REITs, according to Ed John, Australian Council of Superannuation Investors' governance and engagement manager.\n\n\"There is an ongoing challenge related to the use of funds from operations (FFO) in remuneration hurdles in REITs,\" Mr John said.\n\nFunds from operations is a measure of operational profit used in the REIT sector to account for the large non-cash items that can impact net profit and are increasingly being used as a performance indicator for executive pay.\n\n\"FFO are notoriously elastic, difficult to compare and can exclude a range of costs to the company.\u201d\n\nThe differences in how the figure is calculated results in problems when evaluating related performance incentives and remuneration, he explained.\n\nPay packets among the other key executives saw a bigger lift. The average for the group in the last financial was $2.25 million, up by 12 per cent on the prior year.", "description": "The chief executives of the country's top listed real estate companies are enjoying the payoffs from a boom in investment and returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4049%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_260%2C$y_427/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/48a81cb6740c2918994e83b576ddfc9d0671ec4e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
