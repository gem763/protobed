Those violating the ban are liable to up to six months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe move is intended to curtail the months of anti-government protests that have rocked the former British possession and injured more than 1,100 people. But it may instead exacerbate tensions, with activists vowing to continue to defy the government.\n\nSpeaking to media in front of a screen that read \u201cTreasure Hong Kong, End Violence,\u201d Lam said the ban would come into effect on Oct. 5. \u201cWhy do we need to have this? Because, in the past four months, we\u2019ve seen that almost all protestors who carry out vandalism and violence cover their faces,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to hide their identity and evade the law and they have become more and more daring. We believe the prohibition on face covering will be an effective deterrent on radical behavior and help police in regulating the law.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The ban is expected to provoke street protests tonight and over the weekend.\n\nTweeting just before the ban was announced, prominent campaigner Joshua Wong announced that the ban was \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of draconian measures to come under Hong Kong\u2019s Emergency Regulations Ordinance.\n\nThe government\u2019s move comes after Hong Kong\u2019s worst spell of unrest in more than 50 years. Over the weekend, thousands of protesters ran rampant across the city, fighting battles with police, smashing shops, setting fires and erecting barricades. A teenage protester was shot at close range in the chest by police but miraculously survived. Scores of others were injured and 269 people arrested.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s political crisis was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed the rendition of fugitives to mainland China for the first time. Opposition to the bill quickly grew into a democratic rebellion against the unpopular local government. Many protesters are also calling for self-determination or independence for Hong Kong.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The move is intended to curtail the months of anti-government protests that have rocked the former British colony.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1165530297.jpg?quality=85&crop=732px%2C483px%2C3287px%2C1719px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
