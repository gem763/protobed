Singapore Joins the War on Sugar With Ad Ban\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Add Singapore to the list of headaches for sugar producers.\n\nThe country, one of Asia\u2019s biggest per capita consumers, plans to implement a ban on ads for packaged drinks with very high sugar content in a health campaign. The move joins government crackdowns on sugar consumption from Chile to South Africa.\n\nSugar has become one of the most despised ingredients, thanks to its calorie count and associations with obesity. It\u2019s so reviled that U.S. cities from Philadelphia to Boulder, Colorado, have levied taxes against sugary drinks and companies including PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) Inc. have pledged to cut back. Even chocolatier Hershey Co. has expanded its offerings of products with less sweetener.\n\nAs a result, consumption has taken a major hit. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates global demand advanced 0.2% in the 2018-2019 season, the smallest year-on-year gain since 2010 and the second-lowest expansion since 1994.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re noticing there\u2019s been a reduction in consumption -- it\u2019s not growing like it used to a while ago,\u201d said Jose Orive, executive director of the International Sugar Organization. \u201cThat can be attributed to the war on sugar, sugar taxes and displacement by reformulation by some companies.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa offers a case study of what can happen to demand, Orive said. The nation has the highest obesity rates in sub-Saharan Africa and in late 2017 signed into a law a tax on sugary drinks. The first year of the new fees brought an \u201cunprecedented\u201d decline in demand for the beverages, Orive said. Fitch Solutions expects a drop of 0.7% in carbonated drinks sales in 2019 in the country, after a slump of 5.1% in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, world average per capita consumption of sugar decreased 1.3% to 22.6 kilograms (about 50 pounds), the ISO estimates.\n\nSugar is one of many industries undergoing seismic changes due to shifts in health standards and perceptions, with many old-guard food companies teetering on the edge of profitability. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) Co., the owner of Jell-O and Oscar Mayer\u2019s Wienermobile, has battled weak results and a writedown, while dairy giant Dean Foods Co. opted to go it alone after concluding a strategic review last month that included options including a sale.\n\n\u201cSocial media has changed the way consumers perceive and think about food,\u201d said Pablo Sherwell, head of agribusiness research for North America at Rabobank International. It has \u201cbecome their reference point when it comes to diets and food nutrition. Scientists and nutritionists are not any more the reference point,\u201d he said.\n\nFor sugar, demand concerns have helped to drive futures in New York more than 6% lower over the past 12 months. In addition to taxes, an increase in labeling laws -- like those planned in Singapore -- also add to negative consumer perceptions. The industry needs to fight back to show sugar\u2019s role in a healthy diet, Orive said.\n\n\u201cThe industry must improve its communications initiatives and strengthen their messaging, based on sound, internationally recognized scientific evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people don\u2019t speak out, there will be progressive erosion in consumption, and that will be reflected in the prices.\u201d", "description": "Singapore Joins the War on Sugar With Ad Ban", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECAF04E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
