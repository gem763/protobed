Travel to Iowa, home of the inaugural primary caucuses, intensified. The top tier of candidates spent a combined, mind-numbing seven hours at a nationally televised CNN town hall on climate change. Now virtually the entire Democratic field\u201419 candidates in all\u2014is pivoting to a weekend Democratic Party convention in New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nThe realities of this new phase will become even more clear next week, when Democrats meet for a debate in Texas that, for the first time, will be limited to the top 10 candidates, and will bring together on the same stage the top three contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. For those contenders not on the stage, the struggle to remain viable will get markedly more difficult.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which moment this past week has stuck with you and what do you hope the 2020 race brings this coming week? Join the conversation below.\n\nPerhaps most important, the campaign has now reached a point at which the lead that Mr. Biden enjoys in the polls can\u2019t be dismissed as simply an early-days fluke. From the time Mr. Biden joined the race in April, skeptics have viewed his lead as perishable, an outgrowth of his nearly universal name recognition, or simply residual feelings of fondness for him personally.\n\nIronically, the sense that Mr. Biden is a vulnerable front-runner was fueled in recent days by his own campaign advisers, who told reporters it isn\u2019t essential that he win in Iowa and New Hampshire next year, which sounded an awful lot like an attempt to lower expectations.\n\nYet Mr. Biden\u2019s lead has been consistent for four months, continued in polls released this week, and is nearly identical to the one then candidate Donald Trump enjoyed at this point in a similarly crowded Republican field four years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can, on the one hand, point to a lot of significant positive events that have happened for Biden since he announced, and he\u2019s had some stumbles,\u201d says Doug Sosnik, who was political director for President Bill Clinton. \u201cOn the other hand, his numbers haven\u2019t moved in the polls. At least up until now, he\u2019s proven quite durable.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
