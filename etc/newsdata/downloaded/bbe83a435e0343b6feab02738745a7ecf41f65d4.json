The company\u2019s decision to drop the case comes two weeks after the judge asked Tesla to turn over evidence to back up its claims.\n\nTesla says it has video and audio evidence that would do just that. But in a letter to the court on Friday night, a copy of which Tesla provided to The Verge, the company\u2019s lawyers disagreed with the judge\u2019s order to produce the evidence.\n\nTesla\u2019s legal team argued that producing the evidence would expose information about employees involved in the case that was \u201cnever intended for public consumption.\u201d The company\u2019s lawyers also claim the employees have been subjected to \u201cunwanted publicity and online harassment\u201d following the original complaint.\n\nThe company declined to comment further, and instead referred The Verge to the Friday filing.\n\nThe short-seller posted under a pseudonym, but his real identity was outed in court\n\nIn April, Tesla asked the court for (and was granted) a temporary restraining order against a prominent critic who was previously only known by the Twitter handle @skabooshka. In requesting the restraining order, Tesla revealed to the court that the man who ran that account was a California resident named Randeep Hothi.\n\nEarlier that month, Hothi tweeted photos he took of a company-owned Model 3 that Tesla appeared to be filming for its then-upcoming \u201cAutonomy investor day.\u201d Hothi claimed he saw the driver break local speed limits and implied that Tesla might misrepresent the footage during the event.\n\nTesla told the court that Hothi \u201cstalked, harassed, and endangered\u201d the employees who were in that Model 3. The company alleged he \u201cpursued these employees on the public highway for about 35 minutes, variously driving ahead of, beside, and behind them, and swerving dangerously close to the vehicle.\u201d\n\nHothi also trespassed at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California factory a number of times before the April run-in, the company claimed in its original filing. (Most of the filings to the docket can be viewed here.) In August 2018, Tesla said it found an Arlo security camera stuck to a utility pole outside the factory and that an Arlo customer service representative revealed the camera belonged to Hothi. In January 2019, Tesla said it found another security camera hidden in a utility box in one of the factory\u2019s parking lots, which the company\u2019s own security cameras eventually caught Hothi removing.\n\nTesla says it has evidence that Hothi hid cameras at its California factory\n\nIn February 2019, Tesla found Hothi in his car in one of the factory\u2019s parking lots. Two security employees approached him, with one taking photographs, and told him to leave. Tesla said Hothi did not roll down his window and, instead, \u201cdrove his car quickly and recklessly out of the parking spot.\u201d The company also said Hothi struck one of those employees with his car.\n\nHothi is one of many people who are short Tesla\u2019s stock, meaning he\u2019s essentially placed a bet that the company\u2019s share price will go down by a certain date. He has posted photos and videos of Tesla employee parking lots in the past as a way of estimating whether the company is operating at full production.\n\nHothi and other short-sellers have also photographed parking lots where Tesla stashes inventory, which they see as an indicator of demand (or lack thereof) for the company\u2019s cars.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has spent years taunting the people who short Tesla\u2019s stock, often promising to \u201cburn\u201d their positions by announcing good news. But the community seems to grow the more Musk antagonizes, and it especially blew up following last year\u2019s \u201cfunding secured\u201d debacle, which some of the more prominent shorts have said was the reason they started following Tesla closely.\n\nThey organize by using the Twitter \u201ccashtag\u201d $TSLAQ, and post research to a website with the same name. The community quickly rallied around Hothi when the restraining order hit, and one formerly pseudonymous poster even started a GoFundMe for Hothi that has now eclipsed $100,000. (That poster was @MontanaSkeptic, aka Lawrence Fossi, whose identity was revealed after Musk called his boss to complain.)\n\nIn response to Tesla\u2019s allegations, lawyers for Hothi wrote in a May court filing that he\u2019s \u201ca citizen journalist whose research and data have revealed discrepancies in claims Tesla and its CEO have made about the company\u2019s manufacturing operations, its technological capabilities, its financial health, and its treatment of employees and customers.\u201d They claimed Hothi\u2019s research \u201cinformed public discussion about technology in Silicon Valley and has won for him a wide public following.\u201d\n\nHothi\u2019s lawyers said Tesla \u201cpainted a lurid picture\u201d of their client, and argued the company has \u201ca history of using the legal system to silence its critics.\u201d They cite the example of Martin Tripp, a former Tesla employee-turned-whistleblower who was sued by Tesla for allegedly hacking company systems and stealing trade secrets. (Tripp has since countersued, alleging defamation.) They also pointed out harassment that Hothi endured as a result of the restraining order, including being called a terrorist. Musk even emailed Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess about Hothi in 2018 after he found out his brother works for the German automaker.\n\nHothi\u2019s lawyers say he\u2019s a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d\n\nHothi\u2019s lawyers also claimed that Tesla security employees gave conflicting accounts of the February incident and that none of his actions during the April encounter with the Model 3 qualified as stalking or violence.\n\nIn May, Hothi\u2019s legal team requested that Tesla submit all of its evidence to the court. On July 1st, the court partially granted that request, ordering Tesla to submit \u201climited and focused\u201d photographic, audio, or video evidence specifically related to the February and April incidents.\n\nTesla tried to fight this by claiming there was \u201cconfidential business information\u201d in the recordings. Hothi\u2019s legal team responded by offering to let Tesla exclude any sensitive information. But on Friday, Tesla\u2019s legal team told the court it won\u2019t produce that evidence because the company was dropping the case completely. Submitting the evidence to the court would have risked the safety and privacy of the employees involved in the case, the lawyers claimed.\n\nTesla also said it believes it has given Hothi \u201cclear notice not to enter its property and that Tesla will take appropriate action in the future to protect its employees,\u201d and that it will \u201credouble its efforts to protect its employees through other means.\u201d\n\nGill Sperlein, Hothi\u2019s lawyer, said in an email to The Verge that \u201cTesla did not file this lawsuit to protect its employees but rather to discredit Mr. Hothi.\u201d Sperlein also said that \u201c[w]hatever was on the audio tapes that they refused to produce would have demonstrated the first point.\u201d Sperlein told the Los Angeles Times over the weekend that he sent a letter to Tesla notifying the company that Hothi plans to file \u201ca malicious prosecution suit\u201d and is demanding Tesla retain all of its evidence in the case against him.\n\nCorrection: Musk called Lawrence Fossi\u2019s boss, but Fossi was not fired.
