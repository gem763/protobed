I\u2019m proud of the climate progress made the last 4 years. Click http://Elections.ca for voting info. #Capilano.\u201d\n\nThe use of the term \u201cdaughters\u201d by Reynolds suggests that the couple\u2019s third child may be a girl.\n\nReynolds and Lively already have two daughters together, Inez, three, and James, four.\n\nLively first let the world know the couple was expecting another child in May, when she showed off her bump at the LA premiere of her husband\u2019s film, Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu.\n\nReynolds has previously spoken about how much he loves being a father to girls, calling it a \u201cdream come true\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf I could have nine daughters, I would be thrilled. Really, like I genuinely would be,\u201d Reynolds previously told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nHe added at the time that part of the reason he didn\u2019t want boys was because he grew up with three brothers, which caused some chaos in the house growing up.\n\n\u201cMy brothers and I, there\u2019s four of us, we would destroy the house,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cI was eight and I could patch and drywall at eight. We could actually repair an entire hole in the wall in our house within 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason I don\u2019t want boys, because I don\u2019t want a wiffle house. I just want the house to be normal.\u201d", "description": "Ryan Reynolds has shared the first photograph of his newborn.\u00a0 On Wednesday, the Deadpool actor confirmed the arrival of his third child with Blake Lively to his 14.7m followers on Twitter.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/09/screenshot-2019-10-17-at-09.16.55.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
