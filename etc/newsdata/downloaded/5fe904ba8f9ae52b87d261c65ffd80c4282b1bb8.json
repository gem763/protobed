USA TODAY\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s three paragraph statement Monday in response to California Gov. Gavin Newsom signing the \u201cFair Pay to Play Act\u201d was intended to present a strong, defiant and united front against activist legislators dictating policy the NCAA would rather implement itself.\n\nBut in reality, the front is anything but united on what the NCAA should be doing and should be saying at this critical moment for the organization, which is facing unprecedented legal pressure on the long-simmering issue of name, image and likeness rights for athletes.\n\nIn conversations with several college athletics administrators, all of which took place on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be viewed as publicly critical of the NCAA, there was both sharp criticism for the NCAAs inability to communicate effectively and also frustration that years of inaction on an obvious issue has backed college athletics into a corner without a clear path forward.\n\nEveryone is waiting for a working group on name, image and likeness issues led by Big East commissioner Val Ackerman and Ohio State athletics director Gene Smith to issue recommendations by the end of October, but the bellicose tone of Smith\u2019s recent public statements has led to some concern among administrators that any proposal won\u2019t go far enough to satisfy California and a host of other states poised to adopt similar legislation.\n\n\u201cMy concern with the California bill, which is all the way wide open, monetizing your name, image and likeness, is it moves slightly towards pay for play,\u201d Smith told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us who are practitioners in this space to figure out, how do you regulate that? How do you ensure that the unscrupulous bad actor does not enter that space and ultimately create an un-level playing field?\u201d\n\nMultiple administrators told USA TODAY Sports they believe Smith\u2019s committee is focused on measures to address name, image and likeness from a group licensing standpoint \u2014 how money could be distributed from things like jersey sales or, for instance, a college sports video game where real player attributes and even names are used.\n\nBut that still leaves the issue of players being able to make marketing deals on their own, which would be allowed by the California law unless the NCAA defeats it in court.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric this week from high-ranking officials like Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany has been alarmist about a world in which players can trade on their own celebrity, mischaracterizing it as \u201cpay for play\u201d even though the schools themselves would not be part of those deals.\n\nWhile there's a widespread concern that such an arrangement would devolve into recruiting done by proxy with boosters and businesses bidding on 17-year-olds, there\u2019s also a belief that some of those issues could be regulated if there was a will among NCAA leadership to actually address them head-on.\n\nOhio State athletics director Gene Smith, shown in 2017.

For instance, imagine if the NCAA\u2019s statement on Monday had read something like this:\n\n\u201cThe student-athlete scholarship model is the foundation of college athletics and the fundamental difference between amateur athletics and professional sports. Our member institutions are committed to preserving that model because of the tens of thousands of educational opportunities it has provided, and we can preserve it by allowing for changes that recognize there is a value to an individual\u2019s name, image and likeness independent of the college program they have chosen to play for. The question we are weighing internally is how to account for that while also protecting the athletes themselves and promoting a model where young people choose a school based on where they will thrive academically and athletically, not where they\u2019ll earn the most money. These are not easy discussions, and there is no perfect solution in an organization as big and diverse as the NCAA, but we are determined to find common ground that benefits our student-athletes and our member institutions.\u201d\n\nInstead, the NCAA of course went into propaganda mode, trying to steer the discussion into worst-case scenarios and outdated buzzwords like \u201clevel playing field.\u201d\n\nOne administrator who took in the comments from Smith, Delany and others this week saw this playing out rhetorically as a battle between the old guard of NCAA leadership which stands to benefit most from fighting for the status quo and a younger generation that is fearful of the NCAA screwing this up so badly that they won\u2019t have any leverage left to dictate their own policies by the time legislators get done with them.\n\nAs one official put it, it really shouldn\u2019t be this difficult to find common ground and employ some realistic name, image and likeness rules that are fair to the athletes while preserving the basic tenets of the collegiate model. And many of the administrators who plan to work in college athletics 20 years from now are not only open to the idea of significant freedom on name, image and likeness rights, they see it as an inevitability they\u2019d rather have a hand in shaping as opposed to having it dictated by Congress or the Supreme Court after millions of dollars in legal fees spent fighting it.\n\nThe question is whether enough older, well-respected voices with significant pull on school presidents \u2014 think someone like Duke athletics director Kevin White or Notre Dame\u2019s Jack Swarbrick \u2014 will stand up and push for a real solution or whether they\u2019ll be content to kick the can down the road.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is this: The NCAA is losing the messaging battle, and it\u2019s losing the legal momentum. And if that keeps going, it will be harder for the dissenting voices from within to remain silent.\n\nFollow Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken", "description": "The organization that oversees college athletics isn't united on a matter it is pushing as 'pay to play' and dissenting voices won't stay silent long.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
