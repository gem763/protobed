He also complained about \u201chearing an Asian trying to learn English.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d representative said the show hired Gillis \u201con the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for SNL.\u201d\n\nThe clip of Gillis re-emerged last week just hours after NBC said that he and two others, including the show\u2019s only Asian American performer, were joining the cast as featured players.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has taken heat over the years for an overall lack of ethnic diversity, with scant Asian representation among its cast members or hosts.\n\nFormer players Fred Armisen and Rob Schneider both are one-quarter Asian, but neither has been widely recognized for their Asian ancestry. Among hosts, the long history of \u201cSNL\u201d includes a short list of Asian or Asian Americans, with Awkwafina, Aziz Ansari and Jackie Chan among them.\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" has rescinded its invitation to a cast member who posted a video last year in which he used a racial slur for Chinese people and derided Asians trying to learn English.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/tv-snl-new_player_fired_74779_c0-0-1500-874_s1770x1032.jpg?46d511976667280e0ab8763bbec3a6adf9bcf1c3", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
