Evans says it\u2019s possible but investors \u201cwill need a theme to fuel the delusion.\u201d\n\nThose themes could come in the form of \u201cQE Forever,\u201d though he says that\u2019s not likely. \u201cThat jig is almost up and any further rise in inflation will put a stake through its heart,\u201d Evans wrote in his post.\n\nOr, perhaps artificial intelligence will be a driving force.\n\n\u201cThis is the one to watch, which will be a major disruptive force for decades to come,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe theme goes something like this: Companies can lay off all their workers and replace them with machines and algorithms, which will inflate margins to infinity and beyond.\u201d\n\nIn that case, however, aggregate demand and economic growth would be crushed, he said. \u201cThe geniuses are trying to find a balance and, thus far, have come up with concepts such as Universal Basic Income and Modern Monetary Theory.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Evans remains unconvinced stocks will avoid a big reversal.\n\n\u201cWake us up after the above charts regress to their means, about 40% lower,\u201d he wrote as he urged readers to \u201cturn off the talking heads on bubble vision and #FinTwit, who will find it difficult to interpret the... charts because their salaries and year-end bonuses depend on their not understanding them or are incentivized to dismiss them outright.\u201d", "description": "At the midpoint of the year, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was sitting on a record cash pile of $122 billion, leading one longtime shareholder to dump...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX854_buffet_ZG_20181105125320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
