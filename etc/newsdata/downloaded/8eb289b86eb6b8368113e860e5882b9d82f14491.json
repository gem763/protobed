TCEHY, +1.43% owns a 40% stake) is the most financially successful free-to-play videogame of all time, raking in $2.5 billion last year. Within the game, players parachute into an island, where they must survive by finding weapons and battling other players \u2014 either alone, or by teaming up. In-app purchases included skins (aka costumes for their avatars), weapons and other useful items to give them an advantage.\n\nRelated: Keep playing \u2018Fortnite,\u2019 kid: U.S. teen wins $3 million at videogame tournament\n\nBut around 2 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, players were met with a black hole on a blank screen when they tried to launch Fortnite.
