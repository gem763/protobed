It is widely believed it not only plays an important role in human health and disease prevention, but also could be a market with great potential, he said at the 17th International Congress of Immunology held in Beijing last week.\n\nThis is the first time in the world of immunology that the top academic event of the field was held in China.\n\nThe optimism in this field has attracted the attention of medical giants. Becton, Dickinson and Co, or BD, the US medical technology company specializing in flow cytometry, announced at the conference its latest single-cell sorter has been launched in China. The sorter can improve the number of immunological research cell sorting parameters from the present 20.\n\nUp to 60 parameters have helped researchers more comprehensively analyze and create a new era in the field of single cell sorting, according to the company.\n\nLu Wen, vice-president of BD Biosciences for China, said China is developing rapidly on the road of immunization research. At present, it is a gratifying trend and is catching up with the level of advanced countries worldwide.", "description": "As China is deploying more resources to improve the service level of its healthcare system, experts said innovative breakthroughs have emerged in many fields, from basic study to clinical transformation, and the country\u2019s immunology research has great potential to benefit its people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5db00880a310cf3e97a29ba7.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
