It lasted several hours before protesters dispersed through the city's streets.\n\nBarcelona has witnessed daily pro-secession protests since Oct. 14.\n\nThat was when Spain's Supreme Court sentenced nine politicians and activists to up to 13 years in jail for their role in a failed independence bid in 2017, prompting widespread anger in the region and sending shockwaves through Spain's political landscape.\n\nSaturday's protest was not the first marred by violence, with unrest notably on Oct. 18 having been more widespread .\n\nBut it contrasted starkly with events earlier in the day, when some 350,000 Catalans had marched peacefully through the city in support of calls from civil rights groups for the jailed separatist leaders to be freed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOTTLES, BALLS AND BULLETS\n\nThe later protest was organised by CDR, a pro-independence pressure group that favours direct action and has cut off railtracks and roads, as well as trying to storm the regional parliament.\n\nIt began around 7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) and as the crowd grew to around 10,000, according to police estimates, demonstrators threw a hail of bottles, balls and rubber bullets at officers, TV footage showed.\n\nPolice carrying shields and weapons and backed by some 20 riot vans then charged the demonstrators in an attempt to disperse them, splitting the crowd in two along Via Laietana near the police HQ.\n\nReuters TV footage showed police armed with batons forcing their way through the crowd while demonstrators threw stones and flares. News channel 24h showed police grappling one-on-one with demonstrators, who fell back before reforming their lines.\n\nSome projectiles were fired, with a Reuters photographer among those hospitalised after being hit in the stomach by a rubber or foam bullet. Catalan emergency services said that, in all, six people were hospitalised.\n\nThe organisers of the earlier protest, grassroots groups Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, had hoped that, with pro-secessionist parties split over what strategy to adopt, it would refocus attention in the secessionist camp by drawing the largest crowd since the court verdicts were passed.\n\n\"From the street we will keep defending all the (people's) rights but from the institutions we need political answers,\" ANC leader Elisenda Paluzie told the gathering, pledging to organise more protests.\n\nLocal police said around 350,000 attended, compared with a daily peak of some 500,000 at the Oct. 18 protest and 600,000 at a march that took place on Catalonia's national day last month.\n\nAll those figures, however, represent only a small percentage of the region's 7.5 million population and its electorate is almost evenly split over the issue of independence.\n\nMainstream Spanish parties, including the minority Socialist government, have consistently rejected moves towards Catalan independence and all bar left-wing Podemos are opposed to any form of referendum.\n\nThey are now gearing up for a national election on Nov. 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n'PRISON IS NOT THE ANSWER'\n\nBoth ANC and Omnium Cultural eschew violence and their then leaders were among the nine jailed on Oct 14.\n\nMany who joined their march carried Catalan pro-independence flags and banners bearing slogans that included: \"Prison is not the answer\", \"Sit and talk\" and \"Freedom for political prisoners\".", "description": "Clashes between police and militant elements in a thousands-strong crowd of demonstrators transformed part of central Barcelona into a battleground late on Saturday as another day of pro-independence protests turned violent.
