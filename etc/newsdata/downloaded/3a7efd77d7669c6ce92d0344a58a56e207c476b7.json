REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nEconomists said that Monday\u2019s figures, which were worse than an 11.7% drop in exports for the whole of September, underlined the tough road ahead for manufacturers with the chips sector holding the key for the industry\u2019s outlook.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at the semiconductor industry to talk about a rebound in exports because chips account for the largest share of South Korea\u2019s exports,\u201d said Oh Suk-tae, economist at Societe Generale in Seoul.\n\n\u201cIt appears the semiconductor industry\u2019s cycle has reached its trough, but it\u2019s uncertain when the big turnaround will happen, as well as how fast the recovery will be.\u201d\n\nThe customs agency of South Korea, one of the world\u2019s top 10 exporters, releases 20-day foreign trade figures every month and the data is watched closely by economists to take the pulse of the global economy.\n\nSemiconductor exports, which account for around one-fifth of South Korea\u2019s total overseas shipments, dived 28.8% in value for the Oct. 1-20 period on-year as prices around the world pulled back sharply since late last year after strong rally.\n\nMarkets showed a muted reaction as investors have factored in the bad numbers. The won was up about half a percent against the dollar and the stock market\u2019s KOSPI edged up 0.1%.\n\nEconomists said prospects for global trade were clouded given scepticism over whether the United States and China could reach a durable deal to end a 15-month long tariff dispute that has upended global supply chains and slowed world growth.\n\nThe poor export figures came less than a week after the country\u2019s central bank slashed the policy interest rate to a joint record-low on Wednesday last week, a second cut in three months, to support the faltering economy.\n\nOver the weekend, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki told reporters while visiting Washington he was now expecting this year\u2019s economic growth to be around 2.0-2.1%, abandoning the government\u2019s target of 2.4-2.5%.\n\nEven if the semiconductor industry turns around, the slowing Chinese economy means any rebound in South Korean exports could be far from certain as the giant neighbour takes in about a quarter of Seoul\u2019s total shipments abroad.\n\nMonday\u2019s customs agency data showed exports to China dropped 20.0% for the Oct. 1-20 period from a year earlier, while sales to the United States fell 17.4%. Shipments to the European Union tumbled 36.6% over the period.", "description": "South Korean exports plunged 19.5% over the first 20 days of October from a year earlier, pressured by weak sales to China and frail global demand for semiconductors, dealing a fresh blow to a tottering economy.", "authors": ["Choonsik Yoo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443182945&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K03E", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
