Twitch itself is even getting in on the oddity: the company\u2019s channel is showing the black hole, and it\u2019s featuring randomly chosen Fortnite streams from around the platform to highlight. The largest Fortnite streamers are having fun, too \u2014 many of them have turned watching the hole into an event.\n\nLast night, Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins tweeted that for enough likes he\u2019d hint at what\u2019s next (he whispered \u201ctacos\u201d); Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney tweeted that he thinks the game will be back up in a day. Earlier today, I tuned into Timothy \u201cTimTheTatman\u201d Betar\u2019s stream, where he was streaming himself reacting to his first games of Fortnite; it drew more than 100,000 concurrent (and nostalgic, I\u2019d imagine) viewers, a full quarter of the game\u2019s total on Twitch.\n\nSpeculation about what\u2019s happening has reached a fever pitch, because at this point, Fortnite has been gone for more than 24 hours. For a game that\u2019s redefined the way an entire industry thinks about online games, that\u2019s astonishing: Fortnite popularized the idea of constantly updated content, pushed seemingly weekly to servers; it showed that virtual cosmetics can be a significant ongoing source of revenue; and it has turned online multiplayer games into appointment viewing. Naturally, players are searching for answers, which means rumors are flying about as fast as people can think them up. It\u2019s also meant that hundreds of thousands of people are now watching streams on Twitch for any sign of what might be coming next, and when it could be happening.\n\nThe most likely time for #FortniteChapter2 is Tuesday, Oct. 15 at 4am ET - around 12 hours from now.\n\n\n\nWe'll be awake with coverage *if* downtime begins then. For now, it seems that we'll have to continue staring at this god damn hole. pic.twitter.com/LWn8OLYoep \u2014 Fortnite News (@FortniteBR) October 14, 2019\n\nThe thing is, those streams on Twitch aren\u2019t really showing much. Presently, when you boot up the game, you\u2019re greeted with a lightly animated image of a black hole; there\u2019s music playing in the background, but not much else. Fortnite, however, is still the most popular game being currently streamed on Twitch. (At the moment, the second-most popular game on the platform is League of Legends, which has just begun its world championship series.)\n\nWhat does it mean that around 400,000 people are watching literally nothing? I can\u2019t think of any parallels. It\u2019s like if there were a new, heavily promoted Avengers movie coming out and then the execs decided to wipe out its social media presence and then play a weird trailer in theaters instead of the movie. Or, as my editor pointed out, it\u2019s very similar to Game of Thrones\u2019 season 7 premiere, which was a Facebook live stream where people watched a block of ice melt which would reveal the airdate.\n\nEven when the game is literally unplayable, it still manages to occupy the top spot on Twitch\n\nThat a video game can inspire this level of cultural obsession is impressive. But what\u2019s more interesting is that it\u2019s shown how much the creator ecosystem relies on Fortnite as a place to generate content. Even when the game is literally unplayable, it still manages to occupy the top spot on Twitch.\n\nEarlier in the day, a new trailer was leaked. It seems whatever\u2019s coming is going to be called Fortnite Chapter 2, and it looks like it\u2019s going to feature new mechanics, like fishing and piloting boats, on a totally new map. My theory is that Chapter 2 is going to reorient the franchise around the game\u2019s position as a social network \u2014 because more than anything, Fortnite is a place where people hang out. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the starting map reimagined as somewhere to hang out with your friends and do stuff that isn\u2019t murder 96 other people on your way to a victory royale. The reason: Fortnite is growing up. Chapter 2 could be a fresh start for the game that accidentally took over the world. The black hole is a chrysalis \u2014 soon it\u2019ll crack open into something familiar, yet totally new.", "description": "Its tenth battle royale season ended on Sunday; usually that means Epic Games cinematically sets the stage for the new items and weapons players will find scattered around the map, but this time it\u2019s meant that the game has disappeared after a black hole was created in the middle of the island. Speculation about what\u2019s happening has reached a fever pitch: at this point, Fortnite has been gone for more than 24 hours.", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9ljtzVTLlnOXsrSipPZoukFkVA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18963835/acastro_190812_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
