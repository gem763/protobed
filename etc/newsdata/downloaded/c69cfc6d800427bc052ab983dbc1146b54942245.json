It is not clear what action has been taken although travelling without a ticket commands a fine of at least \u20ac50 (\u00a343; $55) on the Paris metro.\n\nVideo of Monday's incident went viral after it was captured by a man who remarked: \"I've seen people flee inspectors but this guy!\"\n\nSocial media users were incredulous that the man had risked his life to avoid paying for a ticket.\n\n\"The metro doesn't run on batteries,\" said one. \"The bloke's prepared to die of electrocution for a ticket that costs \u20ac1.90! He should thank the inspectors for saving his life by cutting the power.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @SamRLIVPIVIF Le m\u00e9tro ne roule pas avec des piles \ud83d\udd0b\ud83e\udd2c. le gars est pr\u00eat \u00e0 mourir \u00e9lectrocut\u00e9 pour un ticket qui co\u00fbte 1\u20ac90 !
