Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to rip higher after the daily close on Friday. As of the time of writing this article, the leading cryptocurrency is trading for $9,200 \u2014 up nearly $2,000 since the weekly low at $7,350 established yesterday. This represents a 25% move in just around 36 hours. Crazy, right?\n\nThis is Bitcoin\u2019s second large leg higher in under 24 hours. Previously, on Friday morning, the cryptocurrency surged by $800 from $7,700 to $8,500 in a surprise pump, which liquidated $150 million worth of shorts.\n\nThis move liquidated $80 million worth of BitMEX short positions, according to cryptocurrency analytics provider Skew.com.\n\nBitcoin Price Back At It\n\nTraders are still coming to terms with this move. But, there are some preliminary analyses of this massive surge upward. Mayne noted that all things considered, the level which BTC is trading at should act as resistance, adding that he is definitely \u201clooking for a potential pullback here to buy the dip.\u201d\n\n$BTC There is a good level here that SHOULD act as resistance. I'm not shorting this, but definitely would look for a potential pullback here to buy the dip. pic.twitter.com/bDw0btU8jq \u2014 Mayne (@Tradermayne) October 26, 2019\n\nThis comes shortly after analysts claimed that bullish continuation was likely. Per previous reports from NewsBTC, Nik Jaremczuk, a Bitcoin researcher and on-chain analyst, has gone as far as to say that this move has solidified his opinion that \u201cBTC price will not return to $7k,\u201d before adding that he could see Bitcoin rallying to $11,300 after a breakdown of a descending trend line.\n\nRight now, the bullish momentum has paused. But considering what has transpired over the past day, it would be hard to guess exactly what comes next.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Wow.
