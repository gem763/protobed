During the event, former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in a tense exchange with a female moderator over his record on supporting gay rights.\n\nBiden was challenged by moderator Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist, about his support for the Defense of Marriage Act and Don't Ask, Don't Tell as a senator. Lenz also questioned Biden about his comment that Vice President Mike Pence, who has a history of supporting anti-LGBTQ rights policies as governor of Indiana, was a \"decent guy.\"\n\nBiden pointed out that he came out in support of same-sex marriage before former President Barack Obama in 2012. Biden, seemingly sarcastically, called Lenz a \"lovely person.\" After their exchange, Lenz wrote on Twitter that Biden called her a \"real sweetheart,\" which she took as condescending.\n\nAs I was walking off the stage with @JoeBiden he said to me dryly, \"You're a real sweetheart.\" #LGBTQforum \u2014 Lyz a real sweetheart (@lyzl) September 21, 2019\n\nThe forum came as Senator Kamala Harris is doubling down on her efforts in Iowa. While Harris has been slipping in the polls, she has announced her determination to finish in the top three in the Iowa caucus.\n\n\"I'm moving here,\" Harris has joked. She has also said: \"It can be frustrating, frankly, to have to make these decisions that that feel like a trade-off. But I plan on spending as much time as I can here.\"\n\nVoter John Elphic told CBS News that after attending events by Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren, he is still torn as for whom he will vote. \"I like 'em both,\" Elphic said.\n\nUndecided voters like Elphic can show up to another big political event on Saturday: the Iowa Steak Fry, where organizers grill 10,500 steaks for more than 12,000 attendees, who will get to hear from 17 candidates. The event will also have 1,000 vegan burgers, all of it made on 10 grills by 40 grillers.\n\nEd O'Keefe contributed to this report.", "description": "Joe Biden had a tense exchange with a moderator over his history on LGBTQ issues", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/80e5de2f-7d75-467f-8904-ba6b7d0aca82/thumbnail/1200x630/a6046976871eed8f7cabd9115cf115ef/gettyimages-1176037338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
