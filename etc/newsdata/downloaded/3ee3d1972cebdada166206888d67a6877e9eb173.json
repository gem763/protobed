Once the appointment becomes official on Oct. 5, 2019, he will be the fourth Canadian cardinal.\n\nFor several years, Reverend Czerny has been one of Pope Francis's lieutenants, serving as the Vatican's Undersecretary of the Section for Migrants and Refugees.\n\nPope Francis blesses worshipers at the end of the weekly general audience on May 8, 2019 at St. Peter's square in the Vatican.
