Now I\u2019m getting tagged in all the Instagram memes and things like that. It\u2019s quite funny. You have to have a laugh about it.\n\n\u201cYou have to, otherwise you\u2019ll just burn yourself out with stress. That\u2019s no way to play. Just move on and catch the next one. I can\u2019t do any worse any more.\u201d\n\nHeaton started the game on the bench but was thrust in due to an early injury to teammate Lucas Rumball.\n\n\u201cYou try and play the cool cucumber all day,\u201d the 26-year-old said. \u201cI thought I had a good mental prep, but then as soon as I saw that I was coming on, the nerves were through the roof. It was baptism by fire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the third-largest sporting event for viewership in the world so when I got on, I was like, I better not do anything like pick my nose or scratch my ass because everyone\u2019s going to be watching.\u201d\n\nSoon after he came on, captain Tyler Ardon burst clear and passed to set up what should have been their opening try only for Heaton to drop the ball with the line gaping.\n\n\u201cTyler took on a defender and then the ball came out of his hands and I went \u2018oh crap, I better not drop this\u2019, and as soon as you think about something like that, that\u2019s how it works,\u201d he said, hoping to put on a better show against New Zealand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to do something big to get me out of it. I have to pull a stunt or something like that. Hopefully, the opportunity comes and I\u2019ll hold it with two hands this time.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Matt Heaton is staying positive by seeing the funny side of things of his error-prone Rugby World Cup debut against Italy on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435093703&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S03H-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
