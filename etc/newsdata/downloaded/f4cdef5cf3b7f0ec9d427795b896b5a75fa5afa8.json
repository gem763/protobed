Michael Che and Colin Jost will continue to host Weekend Update; mainstays including Cecily Strong, Beck Bennett, Aidy Bryant, and Pete Davidson are still around; the longest-serving castmate, Kenan Thompson, seems happy to stay forever; and even Kate McKinnon will be staying put despite rumors that she\u2019d leave after her contract expired this summer. Stability is not an unusual concept at the long-running sketch show, but it is surprising that Jones\u2019s departure isn\u2019t being accompanied by other shakeups thus far.\n\nThere\u2019s still time for Michaels to overhaul the cast\u2014though the host and musical guest of the 45th season\u2019s first episode on September 28 (Woody Harrelson and Billie Eilish) are already set. New cast members have been known to join at the last minute, or even during the season as Jones did, and SNL still has a strong pool of writers who could easily make the leap to performing. But with McKinnon and many of her contemporaries sticking around, and Alec Baldwin likely to reprise his recurring role as President Donald Trump (despite the actor\u2019s continued public grousing about it), SNL figures to stay relatively static going into a big election year.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, Jones will be especially missed, since she was such a vital spark plug for the show. Her Weekend Update appearances, which served as extensions of her stand-up comedy, were welcome bits of provocation that frequently got a rise out of Jost (a host who sometimes struggles to gin up onscreen chemistry with his castmates). Her sketch performing was shaky at first, with Jones occasionally flubbing lines or missing cues, but she quickly settled in as a fan favorite, parlaying the experience into roles in major movies such as Ghostbusters.\n\nJones thrived most in pre-taped digital-video sketches, including a celebration of the Upper East Side and a Naked and Afraid parody with Peter Dinklage. That material always had a good mix of energy and whimsy, channeling her raw enthusiasm for the topic at hand (that vigor was also evident in Jones\u2019s public adoration of Game of Thrones and the Olympics). She was happy to poke fun at her reputation as a firebrand within the cast, crafting elaborate oddball narratives like her sincere desire to play Donald Trump on the show (a sketch that featured Michaels playing himself as a dismissive buzzkill).\n\nMost of Jones\u2019s best material, though, came from her bullish monologues, like an ode to the film Hidden Figures, or an impassioned defense of women who are often called, in her words, \u201ccrazy bitches.\u201d After controversy followed Jones\u2019s first Update appearance, she defended her comedy forcefully online, tweeting, \u201cIf Chris Rock or Dave [Chappelle] did that joke ... they would be called brilliant.\u201d Similarly, when Jones was the subject of online trolling and hacking efforts, she returned to the Update desk and spoke her mind as only she could. \u201cIf you want to hurt anybody these days you\u2019re going to have to do way more than leak their nudes or call them names. You can\u2019t embarrass me more than I have embarrassed myself,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe only person who can hack me is me!\u201d That candor was what made her stand out on SNL from the beginning\u2014and what will be sorely missing when the new season begins.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
