Viewers will have to keep their eyes peeled.\n\nIt appears they may have taken a wrong turn after initially being stuck in the middle of the ocean, with Ant losing their map in the wind.\n\nThey're headed for Australia, where the jungle series is filmed every year - but who are this year's camp mates?\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nRumours are in full spin, with names including Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway tipped to join.\n\nKate was forced to address the rumours live on GMB last week, while she denied the claims.\n\nOther names in the mix include Love Island's Olivia Attwood , Amy Hart, Peter Crouch, Brendan Cole and Nadine Coyle.\n\nI'm A Celebrity 2019 launches on ITV in November.", "description": "A second teaser for I'm A Celebrity 2019 showed hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly in trouble in the Arctic", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723938.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Im-A-Celeb-first-look-Ant-and-Dec-freeze-in-hilarious-ITV-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
