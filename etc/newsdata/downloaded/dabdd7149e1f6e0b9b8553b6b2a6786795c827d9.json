He remained among the few IS commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause either imprisoned or jailed.\n\nHis exhortations were instrumental in inspiring terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe and in the United States. Shifting away from the airline hijackings and other mass-casualty attacks that came to define al-Qaida, al-Baghdadi and other IS leaders supported smaller-scale acts of violence that would be harder for law enforcement to prepare for and prevent.\n\nThey encouraged jihadists who could not travel to the caliphate to kill where they were, with whatever weapon they had at their disposal. In the U.S., multiple extremists have pledged their allegiance to al-Baghdadi on social media, including a woman who along with her husband committed a 2015 massacre at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.\n\nWith a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head, al-Baghdadi had been far less visible in recent years, releasing only sporadic audio recordings, including one just last month in which he called on members of the extremist group to do all they could to free IS detainees and women held in jails and camps.\n\nThe purported audio was his first public statement since last April, when he appeared in a video for the first time in five years.\n\nIn 2014, he was a black-robed figure delivering a sermon from the pulpit of Mosul\u2019s Great Mosque of al-Nuri, his only known public appearance. He urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.\n\n\u201cIt is a burden to accept this responsibility to be in charge of you,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI am not better than you or more virtuous than you. If you see me on the right path, help me. If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.\u201d\n\nThough at minimum a symbolic victory for Western counterterrorism efforts, his death would have unknown practical impact on possible future attacks. He had been largely regarded as a symbolic figurehead of the global terror network, and was described as \u201cirrelevant for a long time\u201d by a coalition spokesman in 2017.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, and adopted his nom de guerre early on. Because of anti-U.S. militant activity, he was detained by U.S. forces in Iraq and sent to Bucca prison in February 2004, according to IS-affiliated websites.\n\nHe was released 10 months later, after which he joined the al-Qaida branch in Iraq of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He later assumed control of the group, known at the time as the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nAfter Syria\u2019s civil war erupted in 2011, al-Baghdadi set about pursuing a plan for a medieval Islamic State, or caliphate. He merged a group known as the Nusra Front, which initially welcomed moderate Sunni rebels who were part of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, with a new one known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Al-Qaida\u2019s central leadership refused to accept the takeover and broke with al-Baghdadi.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s fighters captured a contiguous stretch of territory across Iraq and Syria, including key cities, and in June 2014, it announced its own state \u2014 or caliphate. Al-Baghdadi became the declared caliph of the newly renamed Islamic State group. Under his leadership, the group became known for macabre massacres and beheadings \u2014 often posted online on militant websites \u2014 and a strict adherence to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nOver the years, he has been reported multiple times to have been killed, but none has been confirmed. In 2017, Russian officials said there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d he had been killed in a Russian airstrike on the outskirts of Raqqa, but U.S. officials later said they believed he was still alive.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f9/89/b921a36f413d817b2fa3faa5ee10/191026-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
