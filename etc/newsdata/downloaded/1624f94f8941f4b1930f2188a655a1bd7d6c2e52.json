Elizabeth Warren was even able to score a twofer as she bashed people of faith and the patriarchy all in one answer.\n\nLest you think otherwise, the party of identity politics really doesn\u2019t like conservatives. Or religious people. Or men, for that matter. When moderator Chris Cuomo called on Morgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, to ask his question, Warren was really feeling her oats. His question: What if \u201ca supporter approaches you and says, senator, I\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman. What is your response?\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s response was about as intolerant as one can get. She replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nSee, Mr. Cox is from Dallas and has a very soft southern accent. Elizabeth Warren went right for the stereotype of people in the South. Surely Cox must be referring to dumb white guys. Mind you, he didn\u2019t specify if the supporter was male or female in the hypothetical question. She just assumed it was a man. So, in that one response, she slammed the patriarchy with \u201cI going to assume it\u2019s a guy\u2026\u201d\n\nDoes she think religious women would be more flexible than men in their religious beliefs? Feminists often make the mistake of expressing opinions that lessen the dignity of men in order to prop up women. It\u2019s a wrong-headed approach to equality but it\u2019s a common move. Her little dig at the end \u2013 \u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d \u2013 implies the man must be a cretin unworthy of finding a mate.\n\nThe response is a disgusting pander all the way around. The audience loved it. A CNN reporter openly gushed over Warren on Twitter during her segment of the forum. I didn\u2019t watch the forum because I was working and also because when I could, I switched over to the Astro-Rays baseball game, (My Astros advance to the ALCS!) but I saw a tweet of this question and answer. In the mind of the CNN reporter, this was \u201cquite a moment\u201d.\n\nThis Elizabeth Warren answer was quite a moment at CNN #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/ThpI7YSO8M \u2014 MJ Lee (@mj_lee) October 11, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t think her definition of moment is the same as mine. I saw it as a condescending, bigoted, insufferable response that Warren knew the audience wanted to hear. So I gave my own response.\n\nAh yes. Shade to both the patriarchy and \"old-fashioned\" people. She's quite the superior human being. https://t.co/7mJw3kZELE \u2014 Karen Townsend (@penguinponders) October 11, 2019\n\nThis tweet sums the forum up nicely:\n\nThis town hall might be the most condescending, pandering, fantasy-driven political events I have ever, ever seen. I am astounded that anyone in this room can sit there and listen to these people SO OBVIOUSLY condescend and pander. \u2014 Kira (@RealKiraDavis) October 11, 2019\n\nWill Warren\u2019s campaign use this viral moment for fundraising purposes? You betcha.\n\nViral moments are coveted in the Democratic primary race, where they can serve as a magnet for online donations and bring much-needed attention to candidates struggling to stand out in a large field. Ms. Warren\u2019s answer appeared likely to turn into one of those moments, even though she is hardly struggling to attract attention to her campaign, having risen in the polls to rival former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. A video of her response at the forum immediately drew attention on Twitter, and the Warren campaign soon shared the moment on her feed as well.\n\nElizabeth Warren is a gift to Donald Trump. There is no position too far left for her and if she has to take down normal, everyday Americans along the way, so be it. She openly mocks people for their religious beliefs and her supporters applaud. Same sex marriage is the law of the land because that is how the Supreme Court ruled. A legal ruling, though, doesn\u2019t automatically change the religious beliefs of millions of people. All religions address marriage. How far does Liz think she would get in a Muslim-majority country, for instance, with her intolerance of religious expression? No one in America is calling for the execution of LGBTQ people. All Warren had to say was that same sex marriage is the law of the land and she supports it. There was no need for the snark, she just did it to get the applause. She fights.\n\nTolerance is a one-way street for the leftists among us.
