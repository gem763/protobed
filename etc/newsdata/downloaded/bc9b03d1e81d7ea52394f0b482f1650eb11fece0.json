It\u2019s downright miserable, but a very clever mum has come across an ingenious hack to banish the critters for good.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Jess Proctor, from Stockton-on-Tees in Durham, had a lot to say about Schwarzkopf\u2019s Gliss Express Hair Repair conditioner.\n\n\u2018Anyone whose kids keep getting headlice, I recommend using this,\u2019 Jess said.\n\n\u2018You blow dry it into the hair once it has been washed (don\u2019t let hair dry naturally as it won\u2019t work), it makes hair so soft that headlice cannot cling to it.\n\nJess then went on to reveal that her very own hairdresser, Amanda Birch of Topper\u2019s Hair Design, was the genius who recommended it.\n\nPacked with keratin, a structural protein that coats the hair in a shiny protective layer, Jess said that she has been using the \u2018miracle\u2019 cure ever since she found the nits lurking in her daughter\u2019s hair six months ago.\n\nThe conditioner makes hair super soft, so lice can\u2019t hold on (Picture: Facebook)\n\nLice are a common problem, especially among young children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeneral symptoms include everything from allergic reactions to the louse saliva, itching, redness, pink eye and in some cases, swollen lymph nodes or glands.\n\nAside from the hack and over the counter medicines, other home remedies range from wet combing the hair to treating the scalp with essential oils: tea tree, anise, ylang ylang, eucalptus and lavender to name a few.\n\nResponding to Jess\u2019s post, several Facebook users rejoiced with one saying: \u2018I have been using this on my girls for years and they don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s amazing.\u2019\n\nThe best part is that the conditioner sells for a measly \u00a32, a lovely \u00a38 less than other traditional topical treatments on the market.\n\nMORE: 8 hairspray hacks that will change your world\n\nMORE: Transform your old furniture with these easy upcycling hacks\n\nAD FEATURE: 5 hacks to help you banish the post-holiday blues\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A UK mother claims to have come up with a miracle hack cure to beat head lice", "authors": ["Luke Abrahams"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88522844_1570294795.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
