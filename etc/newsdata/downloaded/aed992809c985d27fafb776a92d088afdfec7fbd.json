Tehran has denied having a role in any of them.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of the reports but had no further information.\n\nThe Iranian reports on Friday offered sometimes diverging accounts. State-run television, citing the national oil company, said the tanker was hit by missiles while denying a report they came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry said the ship was hit twice, without saying what struck it. State television broadcast images from the Sabiti's deck saying they were taken after the attack but showing no visible damage. The ship's hull was not in view.\n\nOil prices rose on the news of the incident and industry sources said it could drive up already high shipping costs.\n\nPolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group said it did not have firm evidence about who may have been behind the incident.\n\n\"The proximity of the tanker at the time of the attack to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jeddah port might imply that the missiles could possibly have been launched from the kingdom.\n\n\"Another plausible theory is that it was an Israeli sabotage operation...The purpose would be to disrupt Iranian tanker activity in the Red Sea corridor as it heads toward the Suez Canal. A third possibility would be that the attack was conducted by a terrorist group,\" Eurasia said in a statement.\n\nThe Red Sea is a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Dubai newsroom and Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Frances Kerry)", "description": "An Iranian government spokesman on Saturday described as a \"cowardly attack\" an incident that Iranian media have called the apparent targeting by missiles of an Iranian-owned oil tanker, and said Iran would respond after the facts had been studied.
