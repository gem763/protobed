The Wall Street Journal says social media monitoring agency Storyful recently identified around two dozen ISIS-related accounts, all of which have since been removed. The accounts posted videos aimed at recruiting followers and bolstering support for the terrorist group \u2014 featuring Islamic State anthems and footage of corpses and ISIS fighters.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how big a presence ISIS has on TikTok. Terrorist propaganda is a perennial issue for social media platforms. Companies like Facebook and Google share a database of known terrorist imagery that can be automatically removed when it\u2019s detected online. They\u2019ve also faced (and won) several lawsuits for allowing it even temporarily on their platforms. Facebook said in September that it removed more than 26 million pieces of global terrorist propaganda over the past two years. TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about how much terrorist content TikTok finds and takes down.\n\nThe accounts that Storyful identified also appear to be relatively small. The Journal identifies one video as earning 68 likes and some accounts as having around 1,000 followers; Storyful didn\u2019t immediately confirm whether that\u2019s typical of the accounts\u2019 popularity, or whether these are the first accounts they\u2019ve found on TikTok.\n\nTikTok videos circulate largely thanks to TikTok\u2019s recommendation algorithm. And in this case, it\u2019s not clear that the algorithm is promoting ISIS content, just that this content exists on the hugely popular platform. However, as the Journal notes, TikTok has a young user base and is known for lighthearted, joke-y content \u2014 sometimes to the point of alleged political censorship. So there\u2019s an added incongruity when it\u2019s used by terrorists.", "description": "Social video app TikTok has removed around two dozen accounts posting Islamic State propaganda and recruitment videos, a perennial issue for social media networks.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGRtqOl8BuJLKbMIib87tuEQrq0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18331847/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
