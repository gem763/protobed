Is this the kind of encore we really want?", "language": "en", "text": "In 1972, when I was 5 years old, my parents drove my brother and me to Disney World. It had opened only the year before, but even then it was fast becoming a standard American sojourn. Sure enough, my brother and I found the Magic Kingdom remarkable as we spent several days taking in the park\u2019s mechanical wonders: the Jungle Cruise, the Country Bear Jamboree and the Hall of Presidents, where an audio-animatronic Abraham Lincoln \u2014 essentially a moving, talking mannequin \u2014 told a charmed, plaid-attired crowd, \u201cMan was made for immortality.\u201d\n\nOne of the trip\u2019s highlights was the Haunted Mansion. After stepping into the gloom of the byzantine manor and being welcomed by the narrator\u2019s fiendish baritone, we were ushered into little cars that shuffled us through a series of spooky tableaus. Soon, below us \u2014 so that we had to peer down \u2014 a lively ballroom scene appeared. There was a long banquet table with spectral diners, and dancers waltzing in ghoulish glory. You could see them, but you could also see through them. The last image you encountered in the room was an organist. He was caped and similarly transparent \u2014 bluish \u2014 and pumping upward from the organ pipes were tiny skulls. The organist was in studious concentration. He was there to play.\n\nBefore the trip was over, in a gift shop I gravitated toward a postcard rack, and there among the offerings I picked out one of the organist. On the long drive back \u2014 and for many months afterward \u2014 I kept studying it. I was too young to wonder how the technicians at Disney had pulled off this effect but old enough not to believe what I saw. I just happened to be fascinated with the very notion of death not keeping a musician from performing.\n\nForty-seven years later, I began to hear about concerts that made me think of that organist again: tours featuring Roy Orbison, Frank Zappa, Amy Winehouse, classical pianist Glenn Gould, Maria Callas, Buddy Holly, Whitney Houston and heavy metal belter Ronnie James Dio. All of the performers had one defining commonality: They were dead. And yet they were all back on the tour circuit, or would be soon, in hologram form, thanks to a new crop of companies that were putting Hollywood-style digital re-creations of famous musicians onstage.\n\nAt some point, I told my youngest son, Anderson, that I was going to be writing about the surge of music holograms \u2014 and, as would be the case for so many people I mentioned this story to over the months I spent reporting it, I had to explain what this was and that, yes, it was actually happening. Anderson, who had recently become obsessed with \u201960s psychedelia artists like Jefferson Airplane and the 13th Floor Elevators, was aghast.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bulls---!\u201d he said. He insisted that the whole enterprise was disgusting and amoral, and in a hot flash he was stomping his way up to his bedroom. As it was for me \u2014 at 18 but also now \u2014 music was the most important thing going for him, and he was simply underscoring the stormy rhetoric that I\u2019d heard from other people or read online. The truth was, I wasn\u2019t far from Anderson in my own skepticism. Was it really okay, I wondered, to let holograms stand in for once-vital, important artists and carry out new performances? Was this an inevitable development in the interweaving of high tech and art \u2014 or did it possibly speak to something darker about our 21st-century morals and our endless quest to be entertained? What did this phenomenon say about, well, us?\n\nAll I knew for sure when I headed out to Los Angeles to begin reporting was that I was about to see dead people. A lot of them. And so were you.\n\nIn 1862, John Pepper \u2014 who had been teaching classes on physics, science and mathematics, among other subjects, at London\u2019s Royal Polytechnic Institution \u2014 perfected an intriguing idea by Henry Dircks, an engineer, who had worked out his scheme but not fully implemented it. Pepper made significant changes to Dircks\u2019s plan, and the result was used in a stage production of \u201cThe Haunted Man\u201d by Charles Dickens: The effect in question made a ghost appear onstage.\n\nThis is how it worked: Underneath the proper stage, a smaller stage was set up on which a large sheet of glass was positioned. The actor playing the spirit would be illuminated from behind, and the reflection from that lower-stage glass would then bounce upward to the glass on the main stage, positioned at 45 degrees, and produce the phantasm effect for the audience. The illusion was soon known as Pepper\u2019s Ghost \u2014 and it was the same effect that would later be reintroduced to a mass audience at Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion.\n\n\u201cHologram\u201d is pretty much what everyone in the music-hologram industry uses to describe their shows, though they almost all acknowledge that it\u2019s not really the proper term. An actual hologram is an intersection of light and matter that produces a three-dimensional object, intended to be viewed from all angles. Today\u2019s music holograms are digital creations projected onto a screen or scrim and are more analogous to videos. And they all took their cues from a curious intersection between \u201990s gangsta rap and F. Scott Fitzgerald, in 2012, that brought the medium into the public consciousness on a much wider scale.\n\nThat year, a hologram of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur premiered at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, performing alongside the actual Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. As John Textor \u2014 CEO of Facebank Group, a company that creates and stores the digital likenesses of celebrities and consumers \u2014 told me, \u201cThere would be no Tupac [hologram] unless Dr. Dre ... hadn\u2019t seen \u2018Benjamin Button\u2019 and decided he wanted to rap with his friend.\u201d In 2012, Textor was co-chairman of Digital Domain, which was responsible for the special effects of such movies as \u201cThor,\u201d Transformers,\u201d \u201cTitanic\u201d and, most important for the future of the hologram industry, \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\u201d The 2008 movie, starring Brad Pitt and based on a Fitzgerald short story, chronicles the saga of a man born old who ages in reverse. It includes an all-digital re-creation of Pitt\u2019s face, aged decades, through a process that captured the full range of the actor\u2019s expressions.\n\nTextor, whom I met at his office in Jupiter, Fla., said that after Dr. Dre reached out, a group of about 20 artists, led by Janelle Croshaw and Steve Preeg, worked to re-create Tupac \u2014 who was killed in 1996 \u2014 in digital form. The project involved filming a body double who mimicked the rapper\u2019s stage moves, then putting that footage through digital animation. The artists created a digital head for the rapper and merged that with the real body, producing an all-new performance. The company AV Concepts handled the projection technology. The project took six weeks to complete and, according to Textor, cost $600,000.\n\nThe Tupac hologram was a revelation and a sensation \u2014 today, it has well over 60 million views on YouTube \u2014 but, after Coachella, it never went on tour. In fact, Textor told me that touring hologram productions could, without the right creative concept, be a limited use of this technology. \u201cBecause it\u2019s boring after the third song,\u201d he said. How are you developing a connection with the character? he asked. The risk is that \u201cyou\u2019re just looking at a projection, and you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018How much did I just pay for this seat?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf you were going to bring 21st-century technology into the realm of live music, it seemed, you had to deal with 21st-century expectations about what being entertained really meant.\n\nAfter Tupac, Textor kept busy with his next project: a Michael Jackson hologram that performed a previously unreleased track at the Billboard Music Awards in 2014. He\u2019s also been involved with holograms of Elvis and Abba \u2014 in 2020, there will be an Abba hologram tour, though all the members of Abba are very much alive. Still, Textor was looking well beyond the musical performance aspect of holograms, or digital humans, which was his preferred term. He was about to introduce a venture that would pit boxing\u2019s greatest from any era \u2014 Muhammad Ali vs. Mike Tyson, for example \u2014 and believes the possibilities of a star\u2019s digital likeness could mean that \u201cKim Kardashian never has to go on a photo shoot again because we can deliver her image of the particular pose ordered up by that particular photo shoot \u2014 you know, Kim with a smile, Kim with a frown.\u201d In his business, he said, the point was to give celebrities a freedom they didn\u2019t have.\n\nA few hours away, the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., had just tapped into the same kind of digital process for an artist whose every inkling tapped into surrealism. At the museum three kiosks show a digital re-creation of Salvador Dal\u00ed, stunning in his likeness and in the familiar eccentric demeanor. The digital Dal\u00ed delivers 125 musings, voiced convincingly by an actor: Dal\u00ed on the weather, Dal\u00ed on his art, Dal\u00ed on immortality. (\u201cI do not believe in my death. Do you?\u201d) Unlike the Tupac hologram, the digital Dal\u00ed doesn\u2019t get projected, but his presence on these screens elicits the same kind of wonders \u2014 and raises the same kinds of complexities.\n\nMuseum director Hank Hine told me what everyone who was dealing with holograms of the dead said, that they tried to tread respectfully: \u201cThere\u2019s very strongly in our minds an ethical question, and that was, \u2018How do we truly represent Dal\u00ed?\u2019 \u201d Everything their Dal\u00ed says about art, and himself, is verbatim from interviews or writings, outside of salting the dialogue with standard pleasantries. But one critical difference is that the museum didn\u2019t try to show its Dal\u00ed painting an entire piece. Most of the hologram tours, by contrast, simulate a full concert experience with the artist, and that\u2019s what makes the mission so ambitious \u2014 and, as I saw it, particularly fraught.\n\n\n\nRapper Snoop Dogg, left, and a hologram of Tupac Shakur perform at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. (Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella)\n\nOn Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame, Billie Holiday\u2019s star is at 1540 Vine St. Her legacy would always be that she was one of the most important jazz singers ever. But a monumental legacy doesn\u2019t guarantee contemporary relevance \u2014 or visibility. If she had a hologram, would that automatically attract new attention? What would it sing? It turned out that just a few minutes away, at the Hologram USA Theater, I could see for myself. Out front one poster announced a chance to see Holiday onstage, and another promoted the original Tupac hologram.\n\nThe theater was closed to the public when I visited, but David Nussbaum, Hologram USA\u2019s executive vice president, ushered me into a room with red curtains and vinyl sofas and a stage. Though Digital Domain had created the Tupac hologram, Alki David \u2014 whose family\u2019s fortune came, in part, from Coca-Cola bottling, and who is now CEO of Hologram USA \u2014 had bought the patents to the technology used to project the hologram.\n\nNussbaum, in jeans, sneakers and a gray sports jacket, said the company\u2019s future was in franchising Hologram USAs all over the world \u2014 think Hard Rock Cafes, only instead of guitars and fringed vests hanging on the walls, they would be filled with dead musicians. With a tablet-like feature in his hand, Nussbaum began swiping across as he got ready to show me some holograms on the stage. Eventually he hit a button and said, \u201cHere\u2019s Billie Holiday,\u201d and the jazz legend materialized at the microphone. The life-size chanteuse, looking vibrant and mortal, began to sing her haunting classic \u201cStrange Fruit.\u201d The hologram carried that wounded coolness that poured out of Holiday. Soon others began to join in around her \u2014 dancers who had been filmed traditionally and were added to fill out the scene. I asked why add the others onstage, since they weren\u2019t part of the band, and he conceded that this wasn\u2019t Lady Gaga or Jennifer Lopez, for whom there would always be dancers around, but that was how people thought of female performers in these contemporary times, and, in taking Holiday from a different era, \u201can audience now might not be cool with just a single person standing behind a microphone.\u201d If you were going to bring 21st-century technology into the realm of live music, it seemed, you had to deal with 21st-century expectations about what being entertained really meant.\n\nWhat Nussbaum loved most was beaming live celebrities to places. Three years in a row, the company had beamed Jimmy Kimmel to the Country Music Association Awards. \u201cThe thing that specifically put us on the map was when we beamed Julian Assange out the Ecuadoran Embassy in London\u201d so he could speak at a conference in the United States, Nussbaum said. He\u2019d had the idea of beaming O.J. Simpson out of prison to do an interview, and he wanted to do the same for Charles Manson. But those plans never came to pass.\n\nAs much as anyone, Nussbaum understood what the Tupac hologram had done for the industry, but he underscored that it wasn\u2019t just musicians that some people wanted to see in hologram form. \u201cWe get everything from \u2018I\u2019m a pastor at a church, and I want Jesus to walk on water during an Easter sermon,\u2019 all the way to \u2018My dad died last year, and I want him to walk me down the aisle at my wedding.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe also told me about a hologram of a mega pop star that hadn\u2019t worked out well. \u201cWe digitally resurrected Whitney Houston,\u201d he said. \u201cPending with the estate\u2019s approval.\u201d I\u2019d heard about this \u2014 you couldn\u2019t talk to anyone in the music hologram business without hearing about it. The performance \u2014 which was to take place on the May 2016 season finale of \u201cThe Voice\u201d \u2014 was leaked before the hologram was fully ready.\n\nIn 2016, the Whitney Houston estate pulled the plug after seeing her hologram, sending a chill to many who were toiling away at the next big hologram production.\n\n\u201cThe idea was that Whitney was going to perform, she was going to go on tour. And so we were going to announce the tour on \u2018The Voice,\u2019 \u201d Nussbaum said. But the Houston estate pulled the plug after seeing the hologram, sending a chill to many who were toiling away at the next big hologram production.\n\nSoon, Nussbaum brought on Tupac. The rapper\u2019s motion was sinuous, and his roped muscles gleamed as he strutted around. \u201cAh s---, you done f---ed up now,\u201d the hologram said, \u201cain\u2019t nothing but a gangsta party.\u201d But instead of Snoop Dogg being next to him, Nussbaum had climbed onstage. \u201cYou done put two of America\u2019s most wanted in the same motherf---ing place at the same motherf---ing time,\u201d Tupac declared. He\u2019d said that once \u2014 the vocals were his \u2014 but the partner he had in mind wasn\u2019t, of course, David Nussbaum.\n\nThen Nussbaum came down from the stage, and we watched together. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you what to write your story about,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is the future.\u201d\n\nNussbaum\u2019s own future was about to shift. Soon after our meeting, he left Hologram USA and founded Portl Hologram. In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil enforcement action against Alki David and Hologram USA Networks in New York federal court, alleging that they engaged in a \u201cfraudulent scheme to induce the investing public\u201d to believe they held rights to artists they didn\u2019t hold rights to, including Tupac. (\u201cThis is an idiotic suit over paperwork that is of no real consequence,\u201d Alki David wrote in an email. \u201cWe did everything right and never made any false claims.\u201d)\n\nNussbaum is not a defendant and is not mentioned in the complaint. At his new company, \u201cthe thing that I do most is live telepresence,\u201d he wrote me in an email, \u201cor as I now call it, HoloPortation.\u201d He had \u201cthe world\u2019s first single passenger HoloPortation Machine.\u201d He could, he said, beam anyone from anywhere to anywhere.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it struck me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t even a fan of Tupac,\u201d Jeff Pezzuti, the CEO of Eyellusion, told me about the famous hologram. We were talking about his unlikely role in this business, and the more he talked, the more it became clear that the advent of touring holograms may have begun because of a Christmas gift Pezzuti received as a kid in the early \u201980s. \u201cThere was this compilation record I got for Christmas called \u2018Masters of Metal,\u2019 \u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I was probably 9 or 10. \u2018Rainbow in the Dark\u2019 \u201d \u2014 by the band Dio \u2014 \u201cwas on it, and I put that song on. And I was like, \u2018F---ing-A, this is amazing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn 1985, Dio, fronted by singer Ronnie James Dio, was on tour and making a stop near the Pezzutis\u2019 New Jersey home. Pezzuti and his younger brother, Tim, persuaded their dad to take them. Jeff and Tim loved the show, and their father didn\u2019t say much on the drive back. He dropped the boys off at their mother\u2019s; when he got home, his wife asked him how the show was. \u201cHe told me this many years later,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cSo he said ... \u2018Just give me two Advil or put a gun to my head.\u2019 \u201d Jeff erupted in laughter at the memory.\n\nHigh school came, then college at the University of Central Florida. Pezzuti passed his CPA exam in 1999, and as a way to summarize his career he said, \u201cDid my V.P. of finance, did some CFO work for 18 years in New York.\u201d\n\nBut in his adult life his love of heavy metal, and Dio, never dimmed. \u201cI saw him every tour,\u201d Pezzuti said dreamily. And so when a friend called him in 2010 to say that Dio had died of cancer, \u201cI was shocked because \u2014 there were rumors that he was sick, but it was so different. It wasn\u2019t like now,\u201d with social media, the immediacy of everything.\n\nThen in 2012, Pezzuti, like millions of others, watched the Tupac hologram on YouTube. Immediately his mind began churning. \u201cI started going down the list of rock artists\u201d who could have a similar return, he said. A couple of years later, despite having little in the way of industry contacts but having done intense research and exploration on his own, he quit his job in finance to pursue his dream of creating musical holograms. He reached out to managers of artists who were dead or alive. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was going in with the solution, but I wanted to just talk about it and see if there was interest,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first manager he met with was Dio\u2019s widow, Wendy. \u201cOne of the first things she told me was that she has spent the last 10 years thinking of a promise she made to her dying husband,\u201d Pezzuti said. When I met Wendy Dio in Los Angeles, she told me, \u201cI did say to him when he was very sick that my lot in life was to keep his music and legacy alive. Which I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nIn their initial meeting, Pezzuti told her he could test the idea with $350,000 as an investment, thinking he could secure another $50,000 himself. Wendy was intrigued, but she needed six months or so to sort through her feelings. Eventually she agreed. \u201cRonnie would always like to go to Disneyland and watch all the holograms there,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he would really be 100 percent behind this. ... Ronnie was always an innovator in music, so I thought, why not an innovator in technology?\u201d\n\nTo create the hologram, Pezzuti hired an actor to play the role of the sprightly Dio \u2014 using the process employed for the Tupac hologram \u2014 and partnered with Chad Finnerty, who had forged a notable career in digital animation and had his own company, Digital Frontier FX. Once Finnerty\u2019s team was completing the singer in digital form, the talk turned to where to debut the hologram. It was Wendy who suggested Wacken Open Air, a heavy metal festival in Germany. It was also Wendy who reached out to Dio\u2019s former band members to gauge their interest.\n\nAfter the band was on board and everything was booked, Pezzuti prepared for the big premiere in August 2016. \u201cI\u2019m flying to Germany,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m like, I\u2019m putting Ronnie James Dio back on the stage in front of 75,000 people.\u201d At Wacken the hologram was top secret, and it also closed the festival, following a set by the surviving touring band of Dio\u2019s called Dio Disciples, which had been carrying on with a rotating cast of vocalists since 2011. \u201cIt was 3 o\u2019clock in the morning or something,\u201d Wendy said. Dio\u2019s record label executives were there. Until that moment, the process hadn\u2019t been particularly emotional for her, she told me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Ronnie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was parts, and it was this, and it was created and so on. ... But then when it was actually onstage with the band, that\u2019s a whole different story. I cried. Everybody cried. We all cried. Because it was Ronnie onstage again with his band.\u201d\n\nThe fervent response from the crowd led Pezzuti and Wendy to plunge forward with a 19-concert tour of Europe \u2014 the first tour of a music hologram with a live band. The hologram\u2019s vocals were taken from Dio\u2019s career of live performances.\n\nWendy\u2019s motivation to partner with Pezzuti went beyond paying tribute to her husband. She saw the future of live music as revisiting the great artists and bands who started so long ago, since they were rapidly retiring or dying off. Sitting on a sofa at the Beverly Hilton, she argued that there had been so many important bands in rock, and that we didn\u2019t have to let them go because they were no longer with us. \u201cYou don\u2019t have another Led Zeppelin,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have another Beatles. ... You\u2019re not going to have another Zappa, with his avant-gardeness and his craziness. All these people are icons.\u201d Then she imagined what it would be to see the Beatles together again. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in a hologram, it could happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Roy Orbison hologram in concert in Salt Lake City. (Chad Kirkland for The Washington Post)\n\nAt the famous auction house Sotheby\u2019s in New York, the holograms were on display but not for sale. Instead, on an afternoon in April, a company called Base Hologram was holding a media event for their creations. Inside a darkened room, a projector hummed ominously. I talked to one of the men slinking around in all black, who explained that he and others had been hired as extras. When the Roy Orbison and Maria Callas holograms performed later, they were there to sit behind them \u2014 since the orchestras that accompanied the holograms on tour could hardly fit in the room \u2014 and represent a sense of stage composition, the hologram\u2019s scale next to people.\n\nEventually, Brian Becker, CEO of Base Hologram, and Marty Tudor, CEO of Base Hologram Productions, came to the lectern. Becker made reference to the earlier tours of Orbison and Callas, and then mentioned that this technology could deliver not just dead musicians performing to audiences, but historic pairings. \u201cSo, for example, can you imagine Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr can you imagine, you know, Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln?\u201d (Who was the Art Garfunkel in that duo, I wondered.)\n\nBecker said that they could do product placement and left us to imagine how that might work. (Would Houston be making a pitch for Verizon between songs?) He also mentioned a desire for artists to interact with the audience, but not in the manner of Siri and artificial intelligence. \u201cWe could have plants in the audiences saying, \u2018I love you, Roy!\u2019 And Roy could say, \u2018I love you, too, baby.\u2019 \u201d He talked for a little while longer, then showed Orbison, who appeared from a mist and ran through a mash-up of classics for about 10 minutes. There was a kind of bluish haze, I thought, a little Princess Leia \u201cHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi\u201d feel to him, and in moments I could see through him. He sang hits such as \u201cPretty Woman\u201d and \u201cOnly the Lonely\u201d as the black-clad extras behind arranged themselves attentively.\n\nNext up was Maria Callas. The tempestuous opera star was known for performing with a torrent of expression and drama, and the hologram radiated that human intensity. At one point, she had a deck of cards and hoisted them into the air, where they floated down like snowflakes. Apparently even Callas\u2019s hologram was a diva.\n\nAfterward, in conversation with Becker and Tudor, I asked about an earlier decision to produce a hologram tour \u2014 later postponed indefinitely \u2014 for Amy Winehouse, who died such a public death in 2011. When I heard about the tour, I wondered: Was there something unseemly about a digital Winehouse \u2014 who had a series of drug arrests and gave increasingly erratic performances or canceled shows altogether toward the end \u2014 singing \u201cThey tried to make me go to rehab / I said, \u2018no, no, no.\u2019 \u201d Somehow that felt more uncomfortable to me than just hearing the song on the radio.\n\n\u201cThe reason we are holding back on moving forward with Amy is because she died [eight] years ago,\u201d Becker said, \u201cand she died in a tragic way.\u201d\n\nBut, I thought, that was true when they first announced the tour.\n\n\u201cI think there is a sensitivity there,\u201d Tudor said. \u201cWith Amy particularly, there were a lot of people who said to us, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t wait. I never got to see her in concert. She never really toured, and seeing her perform would be wonderful.\u2019 And then we had other people that said, you know, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s only been a few years and she died tragically, and she had a lot of people pulling on her, that took advantage of her. And doesn\u2019t this, you know, fit into that?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t the right time,\u201d Becker said. \u201cWe learned a lesson with Amy. We actually had done a lot of work and a lot of homework, but we didn\u2019t do enough.\u201d\n\nThe very reason they had focused on an artist like Amy Winehouse, Becker explained, was the desire to bring back to audiences people \u201cthat really made an impact on the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous demand for nostalgia,\u201d Tudor said. But that demand can make you do a lot of things. That was one of the dangers I saw in all this. Becker acknowledged that, but he said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t put, you know, we wouldn\u2019t have Winston Churchill talk about Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a line,\u201d Tudor said. \u201cI believe there is a line, you know, and if you cross that line, then you\u2019re really taking advantage of that person.\u201d But who was the arbiter? The estates had the final say when it came to creative decisions. But that didn\u2019t mean an estate couldn\u2019t cross a line. Who could really say, when so much money was potentially at stake, what that line should be?\n\n\n\nJeff Pezzuti, left, is CEO and founder of Eyellusion, which produces touring holograms. Ahmet Zappa, son of Frank Zappa, is executive vice president of global business development for Eyellusion and helped create the Bizarre World of Frank Zappa tour, featuring a hologram of the singer. (Andr\u00e9 Chung for The Washington Post)\n\nIt was a little disorienting attending a rock concert by an artist known for albums such as \u201cBurnt Weeny Sandwich\u201d and \u201cUncle Meat\u201d in a pavilion associated with Freemasonry \u2014 but then nothing was straightforward about a show featuring Frank Zappa 26 years after his death. At the Scottish Rite Auditorium in Collingswood, N.J., in a room off to the side of the grand ballroom, I caught up with Eyellusion\u2019s Jeff Pezzuti as he was into the second week of the Bizarre World of Frank Zappa tour, and he was still in the glow of an enthusiastic review from Rolling Stone.\n\nAlready he felt like the music industry was paying attention, since his phone was \u201cblowing up\u201d after the early reviews. \u201cInteresting requests, new requests,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t tell me what those were \u2014 outside of pianist Glenn Gould, which was already in the works \u2014 but he was clearly relieved that his gamble was paying off.\n\nSoon Ahmet Zappa \u2014 who, as one of Zappa\u2019s four children, is a co-trustee of the Zappa estate and also executive vice president of global business development for Eyellusion \u2014 strolled into the room, and he was clearly in the same haze as Pezzuti. \u201cIt\u2019s been this self-discovery process because I feel more connected to Frank,\u201d he said of the early hologram shows.\n\nPart of that had been spending time with the band members. \u201cThese are musicians that were around the house when you were young,\u201d Pezzuti pointed out.\n\n\u201cYeah, I met them when I was, like, 6,\u201d Ahmet said. \u201cYet I don\u2019t really know them so well. And what we all share is a common love for Frank.\u201d\n\nIn Los Angeles, Ahmet had mentioned how in \u201cThe Real Frank Zappa Book,\u201d published in 1989, Frank details his attempts to explore the technology. \u201cHe wanted to have this hologram business so that he could send that out on tour and stay home and work on more music, you know?\u201d Ahmet said. \u201cHe wanted to start his own hologram company. So that\u2019s why I feel like I\u2019m finishing something that he started.\u201d\n\n\n\nA hologram of Frank Zappa performs in concert in Baltimore. Zappa died in 1993. (Andr\u00e9 Chung for The Washington Post)\n\nNow that the tour was underway, he was experiencing new types of connections to his dad. \u201cYou get exposed every night to a whole community of people \u2014 who spent their whole lives listening to your dad \u2014 in ways that wouldn\u2019t have been possible all these years,\u201d Ahmet told me. Despite all the incredible technical aspects of the show, its fundamental purpose was clear to him. \u201cThe goal for me of this show is music first, right? Like, this is the only way someone\u2019s going to hear Frank\u2019s vocals, his guitar, with his band. That\u2019s what\u2019s really unique.\u201d\n\nMike Keneally, on lead guitar, played with Zappa on what would prove to be Zappa\u2019s final tour, in 1988; it was also Keneally\u2019s first tour of any kind. With his square glasses, gray beard and sparse gray hair, he looked more like the coolest computer-programming teacher you ever had than a musician who\u2019d toured with guitar-shredding heroes Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. Keneally said the first time he heard about the possibility of playing with a hologram, \u201cI remember thinking, this might be spooky. And then I saw the footage of it, and I, you know, found it strangely moving.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked him if he felt like he was, in some way, playing with his old mentor again, he said, \u201cYeah, during the guitar solos there are definitely moments where \u2014 because we\u2019re responding. The guitar solos are the moment where we can respond improvisationally to what we\u2019re hearing, as opposed to playing an arrangement that\u2019s been worked out.\u201d As with the vocals, Zappa\u2019s guitar had been isolated from recordings of live performances, most of which hadn\u2019t been heard by the broader public.\n\nThe whole experience was a lot to go through, Keneally said \u2014 the past mingled with the present. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a through line, and so there\u2019s a part of me that feels very young,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m feeling: Here I am. I\u2019m 57. I\u2019ve gained whatever skills I\u2019ve gained in the intervening years. There\u2019s a part of me that is like, man, if I could just take what I know now, my awareness of the world, plus my facility, my technique, bring that back 31 years and be able to serve this up to Frank, because I feel like I can serve his music better now than I was able to back then. So that\u2019s for me, personally, a very important part of the tour.\u201d For Keneally, a digital creation had given him an opportunity to take a decidedly personal inventory.\n\nWhen I got to my seat in the auditorium, I took in the whole setup onstage: All the musical equipment \u2014 the drums, the guitars and keyboards, the electronic mallet instrument \u2014 were to the left or right of center stage, and in the middle was the screen where the hologram would be. Around that space, framing it, were big LED screens that also ran below the stage. The hologram space was like a stage within a stage.\n\nThe majority of the audience appeared 60 and older, but quite a few parents had brought their adult children with them. The near-capacity crowd \u2014 the pavilion holds 1,050 \u2014 was still milling around when the lights went out and musicians found their spots to start the opening number, \u201cCosmik Debris.\u201d On the screens flashed a constellation of lights that began to gather as the song went on, and then, finally, they merged into the human form of Zappa, in a striped short-sleeve shirt and jeans, his hair cascading over his shoulders. He was positioned behind the other musicians slightly, cranking out his first guitar solo to rapturous applause.\n\nThe Zappa hologram, in this form, appeared a little less natural to me than what the Eyellusion folks had shown me of Dio in L.A. Zappa, I thought, looked like a character from an R-rated cartoon of the 1970s \u2014 but then, that was how Zappa, with his trademark mustache and soul patch, had always looked to me. What was extremely lifelike were the human details Chad Finnerty and his group had worked in and made so subtle: the occasional head nod to something he\u2019d played on guitar that pleased him, the casual pacing as he jammed, coupled with an intense sense of listening. I could see that the musicians were energized to be spurred on by their leader again. In Zappa\u2019s guitar playing, the fingering was convincing and exact.\n\nBut the second number made clear that \u201cregular\u201d Zappa would appear only every once in a while, and that\u2019s because the show was about the bizarre world of Frank Zappa \u2014 all the strange imagery he\u2019d created, through his lyrics and album and song titles, as reimagined by Ahmet. Now Zappa took the form of dental floss for \u201cMontana,\u201d a song about, um, the dream of owning a dental floss farm. Where the human Zappa had been, now there was a strip of floss bouncing around, sometimes forming a map of Zappa\u2019s face, sometimes responding to the music and snapping to an outline of him playing the guitar solo, complete with working the wah-wah pedal with his foot. It was funny and dazzling, hitting that generally untapped spot where a jazz-rock acid trip and Hollywood computer animation meet.\n\nFor the next song, \u201cTrouble Every Day,\u201d we were plunged into the world of newspapers\u2019 coverage of late \u201960s race riots, and here Zappa showed up as the narrator in a newspaper picture, hovering above images of police brutality. Next, for that family favorite \u201cPenguin in Bondage,\u201d Zappa appeared alongside a naughty penguin gleefully ready for punishment. Throughout the concert, Zappa would also show up as a claymation figure, a superhero, a poodle, a dirty plate in his kitchen, a disco doll, a giant robot, a hot dog. He\u2019d also appear on the toilet.\n\nAt the end of the show, Zappa, back in his human form, told the crowd in that game-show announcer voice of his, \u201cYou\u2019ve been a great audience,\u201d unplugged his guitar and walked off before vanishing.\n\nI felt bowled over and had a sudden conviction that I understood the \u201970s better. Somehow the show made me wrestle with the idea of dead musicians and their holograms much less than I\u2019d imagined. Instead, I was awed by the sheer possibilities of a hologram show, its range of storytelling options. I was beginning to suspect that maybe, in my initial skepticism about what these holograms represented \u2014 to me, to music in general \u2014 I had been overthinking everything.\n\nBefore the start of the Dio Returns show in Glenside, Pa., in June, Pezzuti mentioned that his brother was coming up from Washington for the concert and that his father would be catching a show later in the tour, too. That was its own closing of a circle: the teenage Jeff and his brother seeing a healthy, vibrant Dio with their father; years later, their father seeing the hologram of Dio that his son had made a reality. Now that was heavy metal.\n\nAfter a while, Pezzuti, who was looking every bit the rock impresario with his shirt unbuttoned halfway down his chest, took me to the tour bus, putting on his sunglasses for the 30-second walk. Inside he rustled up Scott Warren, who emerged quietly from the back in black pants and a T-shirt, with a tangle of blond hair. Warren, who played keyboards, was in Dio\u2019s band for 17 years. After Dio\u2019s death, was it hard, I asked him, to move on to the next musical situation? \u201cWell, I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m never going to play another Dio song again. This is it.\u2019 \u2019Cause, I thought, you know, this is his name, his band, his music.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t quite turn out that way, though, once the Dio Disciples formed. But they often played to smaller audiences \u2014 imagine the E Street Band playing Bruce Springsteen\u2019s music without him. (Then imagine them all dressed in black. And scowling.) Warren didn\u2019t go through much soul-searching when he eventually heard about the hologram. \u201cI thought it would be cool,\u201d he said, \u201cif it was possible, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe poster for Eyellusion\u2019s Dio Returns tour. The hologram of singer Ronnie James Dio originally premiered in Germany in 2016. (Courtesy of Eyellusion Hologram Production)\n\nIt was more than possible, but there were still mental adjustments he had to make. When I asked him how much the hologram captured the singer he knew so well, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be him. I have to \u2014 it\u2019s hard to accept, you know. I know all his mannerisms and everything like that. And how he was, and sometimes the glares.\u201d He laughed thinking about those glares. \u201c \u2018You didn\u2019t do it right,\u2019 or whatever. I know all about that, but you do have to sort of step back from that, and sort of accept what it is because it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a human being, you know?\u201d He laughed with a sense of resignation. \u201cSo there is that.\u201d\n\nWhen I was in Los Angeles, I also met Dio\u2019s longtime drummer, Simon Wright, who estimated that all told he\u2019d played with the singer for 13 years \u2014 with some interruptions in between \u2014 and his initial reaction to the idea was different from Warren\u2019s. \u201cI was a little skeptical at first,\u201d he said in his balmy British accent. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what a hologram was.\u201d But Pezzuti had been a particularly convincing salesman, which helped, since, once Wright was on board, he encountered a hostile, cynical response from online fans. \u201cPeople were really upset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Oh, you know, you\u2019re raising the dead.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s sacrilege\u2019 and all this kind of thing, when really all it is is, really, an image. ... We\u2019re not here trying to rebirth Ronnie. He passed, he\u2019s not here. It\u2019s entertainment; it\u2019s not voodoo.\u201d\n\nWright saw playing with the hologram as the ultimate way to pay tribute to his friend. Still, that didn\u2019t prepare him for what happened next. \u201cWhat I need to say is that when we started to play with the hologram and Ronnie\u2019s voice and stuff like that, it\u2019s like the songs just came alive.\u201d\n\nBack on the tour bus, Warren remembered a moment between him and Dio before a new tour started up. \u201cI said to him, \u2018You know, I just want you to know, as long as you\u2019re rocking, I\u2019ll be there.\u2019 You know, \u2018I\u2019m into doing this.\u2019 And that really meant something to him.\u201d Warren had kept his promise in a way both men could have never imagined.\n\nThe Keswick Theatre was about two-thirds full, and when the lights eventually went down, on the LED screens a forest came into focus, then bats. And then a dragon. There was an explosion of digital flames, and now here was Dio belting out \u201cKing of Rock and Roll\u201d in his signature operatic frequency.\n\nThere was no hushed puzzlement from the crowd, no collective riposte that said, \u201cWait, that\u2019s supposed to be Dio?\u201d The audience ate it up instantly, thrusting the \u201cdevil horns\u201d gesture in the air. Even from this distance there was still a faint CGI glow to the hologram. That might have been compounded by the fact that Dio, with his white blouse, long hair and leather pants, already looked like a bit character in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d But the audience was clearly relishing hearing the songs they loved, and there was a convincing fluidity coming through the hologram\u2019s movements.\n\nPresumably Dio did a lot of gesturing with his left hand, a lot of leaning to that side of his body, since the hologram kept doing that. A lot of devil horns flashing. The hologram covered a small area when he moved, which I understood for technical reasons, but it was also akin to watching a big cat at a zoo relentlessly pacing back and forth.\n\nWith that first number complete, the rotation of singers for the evening began. Tim \u201cRipper\u201d Owens took the stage, then Oni Logan took over, and then it was back to Dio, carrying on in that sequence. Pezzuti had told me earlier that he didn\u2019t think a crowd was ready to sit through a whole show centered on a traditional hologram \u2014 and which the Zappa show avoided, thanks to Ahmet\u2019s dizzying kaleidoscope of ideas. Now that point seemed prescient to me. Every time Dio reappeared, I felt a little jolt of alertness.\n\nDio drummer Simon Wright encountered a hostile, cynical response from online fans. \u201cPeople were really upset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Oh, you know, you\u2019re raising the dead.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe hologram often disappeared during guitar solos; sometimes it turned into flames or mist or ice particles. At one point, the dexterous bassist, Bjorn Englen, walked over and appeared to be inches away from Dio. Until then, the hologram mostly seemed to exist outside of the band, since the musicians rarely looked its way, so this gesture by Englen felt inspired. The problem was that Englen stayed in that position for several minutes, and after a while I became aware that the hologram never looked his way, so I was knocked out of that authentic-feeling moment all over again.\n\nFor the finale, \u201cWe Rock,\u201d both Owens and Logan came out to sing with the hologram, at one point flanking him. This was when the effect of the hologram seemed the most genuine to me, since each of the three singers would take a chorus, and when one of the living singers took over, Dio just rocked on. And maybe it had done this before, but at one point the hologram, encouraging the audience to sing along, cupped his ear, turning the mic \u2014 which was part of the hologram \u2014 outward to the crowd, and said, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201d For an illusion, that went a long way toward conjuring authenticity.\n\nAnd then, in the seconds after, the song winding to a close, the Dio hologram disappeared for the last time. The band gathered at the front of the stage, their arms around one another, and acknowledged the cheers. I thought it would have been cool to somehow have the hologram in the middle of that group, arm in arm, waving to the crowd. The fact that I even thought that \u2014 Why isn\u2019t the hologram bowing with the others? \u2014 was, I supposed, my ultimate verdict on the show: It was real enough.\n\n\n\nWhile the hologram tours of 2019 featured artists from more distant periods, next year\u2019s scheduled shows are slated to include Whitney Houston and Abba, whose members are all alive. (Chad Kirkland for The Washington Post)\n\nWith all this talk of dead musicians and going back into the past, it was inevitable, I suppose, that I wanted to seek out my own lost musical connection. And that\u2019s how I ended up back at Disney World\u2019s Haunted Mansion to see the organist. My guide was Aaron Joyner, from Disney\u2019s Youth Education Series, whose programs use the park\u2019s attractions to help schoolchildren learn. After we went through the mansion, he took me behind the scenes to see what I\u2019d had to imagine for so long.\n\nJoyner led me outside the mansion, through an alleyway and then a back door into a dimly lit area, where we could see the riders in their cars above us. When riders see the organist as a hologram, they are seeing a reflection of an audio-animatronic. I studied the mechanical organist\u2019s pallid pallor up close. The only thing that had changed about him in the decades since my childhood visit was that at some point he\u2019d acquired a top hat.\n\nFor a couple of minutes I kept watching the organist, mesmerized. I was sure Joyner thought I was a little unhinged, but I was lost in a meditation about music and how much reality matters when you\u2019re being entertained. Wasn\u2019t so much popular music infused with some touch of illusion? The Beach Boys weren\u2019t surfers, despite all those early publicity pictures of them holding surfboards. In Genesis\u2019s early days, Peter Gabriel performed in a fox mask \u2014 while wearing a red dress. Alice Cooper was frequently \u201cbeheaded\u201d onstage by a guillotine. David Bowie played a character called Ziggy Stardust. Sun Ra claimed he was from Saturn. If the music was great, the illusion didn\u2019t change that, but sometimes great music existed because of the illusion.\n\nWhen I go to a concert, I want the music to be visceral and alive. Maybe it was time to accept that it was becoming quaint to expect the musicians to be alive, too.\n\nDavid Rowell is deputy editor of the magazine.
