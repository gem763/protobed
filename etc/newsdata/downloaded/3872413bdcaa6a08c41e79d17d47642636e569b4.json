That\u2019s been a frustration over a long period of time,\u201d US ambassador Terry Branstad said at a press briefing with a group of foreign journalists.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the outcome (of the reciprocal measures) will be to get better access for US diplomats here in China,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US counter-measure comes as diplomatic tensions between China and the United States have risen over a host of issues, including a protracted trade war.\n\nThe US measure is a \u201cvery modest\u201d step, Branstad said, noting that Washington is only asking Chinese diplomats to notify the US government about their meetings while their US counterparts in China must secure official permission.\n\nBranstad was himself denied access to Tibet twice before finally getting permission to go in May.\n\nBut when he went to a coffee shop in Qinghai province on his way to Tibet, officials told people inside not to talk to the diplomats, Branstad said, recalling an example of the impediments US diplomats can face.\n\nBranstad also cited the case of US consulate officials trying to meet Chinese students in the southern city of Guangzhou.\n\nThe foreign ministry initially said no student applied for the meeting and then said that none was available. The ministry later said students were \u201ctoo shy\u201d to meet with US officials, Branstad said.\n\nAsked whether the US was also mulling restrictions on Chinese journalists in response to the difficulties foreign media face in China, Branstad said: \u201cI think there has been some discussion about Chinese that are working for (Communist) Party-controlled entities and whether they should be treated as foreign agents.\u201d\n\nVisa delays, detentions and suspected phone-bugging are among the challenges faced by foreign journalists in China.\n\nUS law requires people who do publicity for foreign governments or parties to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department and make periodic public disclosures about their activities.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The United States hopes Beijing will ease restrictions on meetings between US diplomats and local officials after Washington imposed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/484573_in-china-us-diplomats-get-permission-levels-government-meet-local-officials-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
