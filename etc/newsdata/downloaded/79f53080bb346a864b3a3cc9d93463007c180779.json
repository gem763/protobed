It hit as low as $1.2850 in Asian trading before settling around $1.2920 in London, down 0.5% on the day.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: ) raised the probability of the United Kingdom leaving with a ratified deal to 70% from 65%, cut its view of the chances of a 'no-deal' Brexit to 5% from 10% and left its view on no Brexit at all unchanged at 25%.", "description": "British PM pushes for Brexit deal vote after being forced to seek delay", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9K0E6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
