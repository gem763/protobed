Henriques also said Watson \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d one suspect who was never charged.\n\nWatson met Carl Beech, the fantasist who fooled detectives, and helped police who wanted Beech to let them investigate his claims of abuse \u2013 later shown to be false \u2013 after he had publicised them on a website called Exaro.\n\nBeech was at first known only by the name \u201cNick\u201d and the man whose lies sparked a witch-hunt against the innocent said Watson was part of \u201ca little group that supported me\u201d.\n\nHenriques\u2019 report, commissioned by the Metropolitan police, said of Watson, who had a long standing interest in abuse cases: \u201cThere can be no doubt that Tom Watson believed Nick and it should be stated that he had previously provided the MPS with information leading to convictions in other cases. His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS officers.\u201d\n\nQuick guide What was Operation Midland and how did it go wrong? Show Hide What was Operation Midland? Operation Midland was set up by the Metropolitan police in November 2014 to examine allegations of child sexual abuse and homicide. It was based on false claims by Carl Beech, known as \"Nick\", that he was abused by public figures of authority from 1975 to 1984, and witnessed the abuse of others. He made widely reported false allegations about being taken to parties at exclusive private members\u2019 clubs, in Dolphin Square in London and other locations \u2013 including swimming pools \u2013 attended by among others the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the then chief of defence staff Lord Bramall, the ex-MI5 chief Sir Michael Hanley, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Operation MIdland was closed in March 2016 with no charges brought. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July 2019 for making the claims. He is appealing against the conviction and the sentence.\n\nA 2016 report into the investigation said it was \u2018riddled with errors\u2019, identifying 43 individual errors made by officers, that the team misled a judge to get search warrants, and finding that five officers, including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner, would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failings.\n\n\n\nBrittan was also the subject of a historic rape claim from a woman known as Jane. She was angry when police dropped the case without interviewing Brittan.\n\nWatson wrote a letter to the head of the Crown Prosecution Service intervening in the case.\n\nHenriques said the Met was wrong to subject Brittan to an interview over a 1967 rape allegation, and ignored the views of one of its senior detectives that there was no case to answer.\n\nHenriques, in his report, says the investigation of Brittan over the rape claim could have ended 16 months earlier than it did, and should have been halted in June 2014.\n\nThe report says: \u201cA possible inference is that the officers, then responsible, were in a state of panic induced by Mr Watson\u2019s letter.\u201d\n\nThe review says Watson described Lord Brittan as being as \u201cclose to evil as any human being could be\u201d, and condemns the Labour MP, saying he \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d the former home secretary.\n\nWatson claims he was quoting the words of an alleged victim.\n\nHenriques condemns the Met\u2019s pursuit of Brittan over the 1967 rape allegation. The former home secretary died in January 2015 without being told the case against him was being dropped.\n\n\u201cThe prolonged extension of both this investigation and Operation Midland was unjustifiable and most unfair to the Brittan family. Both investigations should have been completed very much sooner. Lord Brittan should have been informed that no further action would be taken against him during his lifetime,\u201d the report says.\n\nIn a statement, Watson said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that this review, which contains multiple inaccuracies regarding myself, has been selectively leaked, seemingly to refocus criticism away from the Metropolitan police.\n\n\u201cThe report doesn\u2019t make clear the key point that Lord Brittan was interviewed by the police before they received my letter \u2026 ex-director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by police until after the interview. It therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed.\n\n\u201cI have always said that it wasn\u2019t my place to judge whether sexual abuse allegations were true or false \u2013 that was for the police. The police asked me to encourage the hundreds of people that came to me with stories of child abuse to report their stories to the police. That is what I did.\u201d\n\nThe former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, a target of the Midland investigation, said: \u201cThe problem was that the police assigned to interview Beech lacked common sense and yielded to intense pressure from Tom Watson, an irresponsible politician out for his own publicity in order to galvanise his advancement to become deputy leader of the Labour party.\u201d\n\nLady Brittan told the Times; \u201cThe extent of Tom Watson\u2019s involvement in the witch-hunt of innocent people has been laid bare. His subsequent attempts to distance himself show a complete lack of integrity. By misusing his public office to recklessly repeat false allegations, and to characterise himself as a victim, he has shown that he is unfit to hold the office of MP.\u201d\n\nBen Emmerson QC, the former lead lawyer for the government\u2019s Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, praised Watson\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cMr Watson was quite open, and told me that it was not his role to assess the credibility of the individual allegations he had received, but merely to ensure that they were properly investigated. Due to the sheer volume of complaints that were received in his office, he felt that it was his duty as a parliamentarian to use his platform to ensure that proper resources were put into discovering if there had been a paedophile ring operating with connections to Westminster. \u2026 His response to my questions was measured and sensible.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Intervention by Labour deputy leader left police officers \u2018in state of panic\u2019, says report", "authors": ["Vikram Dodd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d279d052802dbc38b419e89c52b241e13be4c1d/556_362_2942_1765/master/2942.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c75ec856990709fe23d3f42369041ddf", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
