Employees' options were limited to degrees in business and logistics management, but now they can pursue careers as pharmacy technicians and opticians, or a degree in healthcare management and administration and health science.\n\nWalmart President of Health and Wellness Sean Slovenski told Business Insider Prime that the company's goal in healthcare is to transform it in much the same way that Walmart's supercenter stores transformed retail: by bringing a wide variety of services to consumers at a lower price point than competitors.\n\nWalmart's bold move into primary care will require more specialized staff across the healthcare spectrum \u2014 and leveraging its massive, preexisting employee pool is a good place to start. Walmart Health clinics will offer a variety of services, ranging from lab work and immunizations to behavioral health services.\n\nIf the company wants to bring Walmart Health to scale, it will need huge regiments of certified healthcare workers to deliver those services. It makes sense that Walmart would seek to leverage its massive workforce to potentially fill at least some of these roles, considering the company employs approximately 1.5 million people in the US \u2014 about 1% of the country's total working population.\n\nAnd Walmart's interest in \"community health worker[s]\" and \"care host[s]\" suggests the company may be interested in a more personalized approach to care. Walmart CMO Thomas Van Gilder revealed that the company isn't just looking to hire traditional clinical practitioners, but also wants to address the social determinants of health that may create barriers to care for its patients, per BI Prime reporting.\n\nThe company says it's interested in building out teams of workers to help patients sign up for appointments and assist with nonemergency medical transportation to and from Walmart Health locations. Addressing social determinants of health has become a major priority for providers and insurers across the industry, including UnitedHealthcare.\n\nWalmart's healthcare play is centered around its large geographic footprint and strength in rural markets \u2014 and primary care competitors should be thinking about how they plan to compete. Over 90% of US consumers live within 10 miles of one of Walmart's more than 5,000 locations \u2014 and many of those locations are in rural areas where patients are experiencing severe healthcare shortages.\n\nOver 20% of rural hospitals in the US are at risk of shutting down due to financial difficulties, and 112 million people in the US live in mental healthcare professional shortage areas. Given that Walmart Health will focus on in-person health services, including behavioral health counseling, the company's primary care play has the potential to really take off in underserved rural communities \u2014 cutting travel time required to access basic healthcare services, while also delivering those services at an affordable price point.\n\nWalmart pulled in $36 billion, or about 9% of its $332 billion total US revenue from its health and wellness segment in its last fiscal year (ended January 31, 2019), but we think health will account for a much greater percentage of Walmart's total revenue in the years ahead. Walmart Health is likely just the beginning of the retailer's plans to bring everyday low prices to healthcare.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
