Unlike the Ireland match in which coach Natalie Milicich was unsatisfied with their inconsistency, Singapore maintained their intensity throughout the match and Cook Islands failed to narrow the deficit despite being a constant threat.\n\nAnd Milicich was full of praise for her charges this time around. \u201cI am very proud that we really implemented our game plan, we knew what we had to do, especially defensively,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was really important today to convert all those opportunities that we did get to build a lead and once we had it, we have really been working on how we can keep it, I felt that we did that today. We still need to re-gather and see what we can work with on the results we have today. We played a good game but not a perfect game.\u201d\n\nCaptain and goal shooter Charmaine Soh had a stellar game with a 93 per cent shooting accuracy, making 42 of 45 shot attempts.\n\n\u201cWe know that the game will be very important because it will determine whether we will be in the finals, so we had to beat them at this game. I played them a few years ago and they were really tough,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe came into this game with the mentality to go all out, which is to start strong and maintain possession, maintain passes, to stay calm, composed and any balls that they intercept will just be a bonus.\n\n\u201cThis is our second win (in the tournament), which is really amazing. This will help to keep our spirits high. The game on Friday will be another challenge for us to have another win. So if we win we can hopefully look into to the finals if it\u2019s meant for us.\u201d\n\nAfter four days of competition. Namibia \u2013 who beat Papua New Guinea 59-47 on Wednesday \u2013 are in top spot with seven points, while Botswana are in second place with six points after beating Ireland 46-34. Singapore are in third with five points.\n\nAfter a rest day on Thursday, Singapore will face winless Papua New Guinea in their final pool match on Friday. They will qualify for Saturday\u2019s final if they win the match and Botswana lose to Namibia. Ireland will also play Cook Islands on Friday.\n\nFor more information, please visit Netball Singapore\u2019s website, and tickets to the tournament are available here.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSingapore get 1st win at Netball Nations Cup, beating Ireland 51-35\n\nSingapore netballers remain upbeat despite 52-57 Nations Cup loss to Botswana\n\nSingapore snatch dramatic 54-54 draw in Netball Nations Cup opener against Namibia\n\nNations Cup tune-up for Singapore netballers' ultimate goal: reclaiming SEA Games gold from Malaysia", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 The Singapore national netball team, ranked 28th in the world, notched an upset 59-47 victory over world No. 12 Cook Islands in the Netball Nations Cup at OCBC Arena on Wednesday (23 October).", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Editorial Team"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1qLIm_bWRp33Aj80MYhOCg--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/35db2ab0-f5f1-11e9-bfef-4d47a7f6dbe9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
