And that will be what Trump is putting out there.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cInstead of sending another 15 tweets about how \u2018perfect\u2019 his call with the Ukrainian leader was or focusing so much on impeachment, why not just laser-focus your attention on the corruption of Hunter and Joe Biden?\u201d a former White House official asked, rhetorically, also citing poll numbers showing many Americans supporting a Biden probe\u2026\n\n\u201cIf I was the president I would ignore the impeachment process as much as you could,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a veteran GOP strategist who now leads the pro-Trump group Great America PAC. Told that that seemed unlikely, Rollins replied, \u201cYou are asking me what my advice would be, not what advice would be taken.\u201d\n\nPrivate GOP polling data from swing seats in the House of Representatives that was shared with The Daily Beast underscored the dynamic that Rollins outlined.
