Abienwi had been in the agency\u2019s custody since Sept. 19, held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center roughly one and a half miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAfter Abienwi experienced \u201ca hypertensive event in the middle of the night\u201d last Thursday, ICE Health Service Corps staff contacted local emergency services. Abienwi, who appeared to be paralyzed on his left side and was unresponsive to medical staff, was transferred to nearby Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, ICE said, where he passed away on Tuesday.\n\nMedical staff initially identified the cause of Abienwi\u2019s death as brain death secondary to a basal ganglia hemorrhage. A spokesperson for the medical center did not immediately respond to questions regarding Abienwi\u2019s death or stay at Sharp Chula Vista.\n\n\u201cMr. Abienwi\u2019s next of kin and the Consulate General of Cameroon were notified of his death,\u201d ICE said in the statement. \u201cICE is firmly committed to the health and welfare of all those in its custody and is undertaking a comprehensive agency-wide review of this incident, as it does in all such cases.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, ICE spokesperson Lauren Mack told The Daily Beast that the agency does not confirm or deny \u201cwhether a person in our custody applied for asylum.\u201d\n\nICE directed The Daily Beast to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for more details about his time in that agency\u2019s custody.
