After meeting Ross at the residence, Ishmael and the other deputy were allegedly shot at by Vasquez-Orozco and Morales.\n\nWhile the San Joaquin County deputy suffered a gunshot wound to the thigh, Ishmael was hit in the chest and foot and he ultimately died. Members of the SWAT Team surrounded the property to take the two illegal aliens into custody.\n\nRoss was also arrested after police said he failed to disclose that he had a business relationship with the two illegal aliens.\n\nVasquez-Orozco has been charged with murder and assault with a deadly weapon, while Morales has been charged as an accessory to a murder. Ross has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection to the murder.\n\nAll three have pleaded not guilty. Vasquez-Orozco is being held without bond, and Morales has had his bond set at $250,000.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands are expected to attend a funeral on Tuesday for Ishmael.\n\nThe case is the latest in which illegal aliens have been charged with murdering Americans in a sanctuary state. Most recently, in the sanctuary state of Illinois, a 25-year-old illegal alien has been charged with killing two legal immigrants and injuring two others in a drunk driving crash.\n\nLast year, an illegal alien gang member was charged with murdering Newman, California, police officer Ronil Singh \u2014 a legal immigrant from Fiji \u2014 while seven illegal aliens have been either charged or convicted with aiding the accused murderer.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
