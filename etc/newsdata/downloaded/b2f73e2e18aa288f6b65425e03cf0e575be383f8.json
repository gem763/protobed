Jim Banks does", "language": "en", "text": "As Twitchy reported earlier, reporters were growing frustrated trying to get some comment from the Pete Buttigieg camp on the death of a South Bend abortionist and the discovery of the remains of 2,246 medically preserved fetuses in his home. However, Buttigieg opened up to a TV camera Wednesday afternoon after days of silence and said he didn\u2019t want the incident to become political.\n\nJust another local crime story I guess\u2026 https://t.co/dUG75s18UX \u2014 John Sexton (@verumserum) September 19, 2019\n\nOne person who made it political is Rep. Jim Banks, who posted this thread on Sunday and which has surfaced again Wednesday night:\n\nIt must be noted Pete Buttigieg opposed options for women in South Bend that could\u2019ve provided an alternative to the direct descendant to Ulrich Klopfer\u2019s house of horrors. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nI was working with then-Governor Mike Pence while I was in the Indiana Senate to restrict Indiana abortionists \u2013 who we felt needed additional oversight \u2013 and at the same time promote better care options for women. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nOur fears became justified after the Women\u2019s Pavilion (owned by Dr. Klopfer) was found to have violated the law nine times. For example, Dr. Klopfer performed an abortion on a 10 yr old who was raped by her uncle. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nSouth Bend\u2019s Whole Women\u2019s Health replaced the Pavilion and employed some of the same staff as the Women\u2019s Pavilion. Liam Morley, Dr. Klopfer\u2019s former employee, was listed as the clinic\u2019s administrator. One physician said it \u201chas the same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer\u2019s.\u201d \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nAs such, the Indiana Department of Health found Whole Women\u2019s Health unsafe for lacking a \u201creputable and responsible character.\u201d The State of Indiana denied the abortion facility a license. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nBut there was a push to keep Whole Women\u2019s Health open. That effort resulted in a federal judge issuing a preliminary injunction allowing it to perform unlicensed abortions. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nThis bothered many. Some residents decided to open a pro-life pregnancy center called Women\u2019s Care Center right next to the Whole Women\u2019s Health. The hope was that women would be provided a safe, alternative choice to Whole Women\u2019s Health. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nBut South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg obstructed the alternative facility. He proudly vetoed a rezoning decision, denying Women\u2019s Care Center their intended site. It forced them to find a new location to open. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nAfterwards, he touted his veto to the South Bend Tribune. Buttigieg told the Tribune he did not find it \u201cresponsible\u201d to situate the two organizations \u201cliterally right next to each other.\u201d \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nTo this day, Mayor Pete seems proud he supported Whole Women\u2019s Health with \u201cthe same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer\u2019s.\u201d His national press secretary recently touted it in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nThis is especially troubling now that we\u2019ve learned what kind of monster Dr. Klopfer really was. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nNow that this has come to light, Mayor Pete Buttigieg should apologize for his actions and his flagrant disregard for the state of Indiana\u2019s skepticism towards Whole Women\u2019s Health. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nThe good news in all this is that the pro-life Women\u2019s Care Center remains undeterred. It serves 2/3 of mothers in South Bend and offers a multitude of free medical services, parenting classes and important goods such as strollers, cribs, car seats and clothing. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019\n\nPlease, Jim. Pete's asking us not to politicize this issue because only he's allowed to do that. https://t.co/RSgB9Mbuql \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) September 19, 2019\n\nExactly.\n\nRelated:", "description": "Rep.
