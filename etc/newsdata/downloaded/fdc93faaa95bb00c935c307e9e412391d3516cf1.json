It turns out on the substance of the question, Castro was wrong. Here\u2019s one of the biggest moments of the third Democratic debate.\n\n[Highlights: The third Democratic debate]\n\nWhat happened\n\nDemocrats, as they have in the previous two debates, engaged in an intense round of questions about whether Medicare-for-all is a realistic health-care plan.\n\nBiden represents the wing of the party that feels it goes too far and would be too costly, so the more liberal members of the group (such as, but not necessarily led by, Castro) rebutted him. The three candidates in the top tier \u2014 Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 got the first questions and went a few rounds among themselves before the others were called upon.\n\nOn Castro\u2019s turn, he immediately sought to draw a contrast with Biden, who is the leader in the polls. Castro cast Biden\u2019s plan as one that would make people opt in to Medicare, accusing Biden of falling short of Barack Obama\u2019s ultimate goal of having every American insured. Here\u2019s the exchange that resulted.\n\nCastro: \u201cIf they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do. But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn\u2019t have a buy-in.\n\nThat\u2019s a big difference, because Barack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not. My plan would do that, your plan would not.\u201d\n\nBiden: \u201cThey do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.\u201d\n\nCastro: \u201cYou just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. \u201d\n\nBiden: (trying to talk over Castro) \u201cI said if they can\u2019t afford it \u2026 If you qualify for Medicaid, you\u2019d automatically be \u2026\u201d\n\nCastro: \u201cYou said they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying that they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\n\nBiden: \u201cI said anyone \u2014 your grandmother who has no money \u2014 she would, you\u2019re automatically enrolled.\u201d\n\nCastro: \u201cWe need a health-care system that automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health-care plan would not automatically enroll you; you would have to opt in. My health-care plan would. That\u2019s a big difference. I\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not.\n\nBiden: \u201cThat will be a surprise to him.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the quote Castro may have been referring to, from Biden\u2019s earlier exchange with Sanders and Warren: \u201cThe option I\u2019m proposing is Medicare for all \u2014 Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance \u2014 from your employer, you automatically can buy in to this. You don\u2019t have \u2014 no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\u201d\n\nBut what Castro doesn\u2019t mention is Biden also said this: \u201cOkay, number one, my health-care plan does significantly cut the costs of \u2014 the largest out-of-pocket payment you\u2019ll pay is $1,000. You\u2019ll be able to get into a \u2014 anyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\u201d\n\nThe backstory\n\nThere are two backstories here, the politics and the policy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the politics. Castro was calling Biden old, plain and simple, by accusing him of forgetting what he said. Whispers about Biden\u2019s age have followed him on the campaign trail.\n\nAt 76, he\u2019s not the oldest candidate in the primary. (Sanders is 78. And, for reference, President Trump is 73.) But Biden was most recently on the national stage three years ago, and some people think he\u2019s, well, aged since then.\n\n\u201cVoters are going into events with him expecting \u2018Uncle Joe,\u2019 but they come out having seen \u2018Grandpa Joe,\u2019 \u201d strategist Rebecca Katz said in May.\n\nPlus, Biden\u2019s bumper-sticker line to voters is that he is the most experienced, most knowledgeable and most skilled candidate to take on Trump. One reason his age resonates so much is because it\u2019s a symbol of his electability.\n\nSometimes he does things that make the perception he\u2019s aged worse. \u201cMake sure you have the record player on at night,\u201d he said in Thursday\u2019s debate, referring to how communities can help educate children.\n\nIn the first debate, he misstated how people should reach out to his campaign. He has given mediocre debate performances during which, at times, he cuts himself off rather than continue to fight his primary challengers. (\u201cMy time\u2019s up,\u201d he said in one debate.) The Washington Post has found he has mixed up three separate wartime stories into one that never happens, but he tells it every chance he gets on the campaign trail.\n\nHis primary opponents have mostly avoided talk of this, at least so directly. It risks coming across as mean or even ageist. Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) repeatedly told Biden to \u201cpass the torch\u201d during the first debate. And Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) said last week he thinks Biden is \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nBut Swalwell dropped out and Ryan didn\u2019t make the debate stage. Castro was onstage, and went there.\n\nHe told ABC after the debate, \u201cI wasn\u2019t taking a shot at his age. It\u2019s about the health-care policy.\u201d But look at the exchange, and you\u2019ll see Castro accused Biden of forgetting not once but several times. It\u2019s hard to believe he didn\u2019t know how his words would be taken.\n\nIt looks as though Biden\u2019s age is now fair game for some of his top opponents.\n\nBooker on CNN:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling\u2026 (Castro) has every right to call that out. I do think tone and tenor is really important.\u201d \u2014 Tal Kopan (@TalKopan) September 13, 2019\n\nBut Biden didn\u2019t actually forget anything. At least, not on the substance of the policy. Biden explained earlier that his plan does allow people to choose Medicare (\u201cMedicare by choice,\u201d he called it), but that people who qualify for it financially will automatically be enrolled in it.\n\nTale of the transcript:\n\n\n\nBiden, 8:22 pm: \"Anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\"\n\n\n\nCastro, 8:35: \"You just two minutes ago they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" \u2014 Mike Memoli (@mikememoli) September 13, 2019\n\nThere are people who automatically get enrolled in his plan. As Biden said, these people \u201cdo not have to buy in.\u201d Castro might take issue with the fact some people do have to buy in. (Biden said earlier that if you lose your job and need new insurance, you could buy in to this.) But he was incorrect that Biden forgot something about his own plan. It was Castro who forgot what Biden said.\n\nBiden plans to build on Obamacare, which set up a market for private insurance and encouraged states to expand Medicaid, to create a government-run public option as well. Castro\u2019s issue was that Biden\u2019s plan does not create universal coverage; he singled out that an estimated 10 million Americans would still be uninsured under Biden\u2019s plan.\n\nA risky move for Castro just became riskier: He called out Biden in a way that could be considered below-the-belt. And he didn\u2019t nail the substance. But it got us talking about him.", "description": "Julian Castro calls out the elephant in the room: Joe Biden\u2019s age.
