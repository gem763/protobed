We cannot lie,\u201d the manager said. \u201cTo concede after two minutes then lose our captain was massive for the team. It was an emotional game. The team was affected, we started to play but never showed our real performance. I don\u2019t want to take credit from Brighton but of course the team suffered a massive impact.\n\nBrighton pile pressure on Pochettino as Tottenham lose Lloris to horror injury Read more\n\n\u201cIn the second half we tried to find a solution. But [at] 3-0 we saw there was nothing to be done in the game. I feel sorry for our fans, I want to say thanks for the effort to come here, we know how they feel, we are disappointed too. We need now to find a way to stay together.\u201d\n\nPochettino said Spurs will go into the international break in a state of mild shock after two crushing losses, defeat here following the shellacking against Bayern Munich in midweek. \u201cIn the last five days we were really punched by football, 7-2 and 3-0. You don\u2019t feel good in those moments. We hope that the break will offer us a chance to change the dynamic and the energy.\u201d\n\nIt was also put to Pochettino that another defeat will lead to calls for change at the top. \u201cI accept the criticism,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to show my commitment. It is there after five and a half years. Of course pundits need to talk and have opinions. In my position I have to accept it, same as it is when we are praised.\u201d\n\nFor Graham Potter victory brought a sense of the season starting in earnest with a first home win. \u201cYou need luck, which we got with the first goal,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cBut overall I\u2019m really happy with the performance. We defended well, attacked well, and when we made mistakes we recovered.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThere was praise for 19-year-old Aaron Connolly, who scored twice. \u201cAaron gave us another dimension because that\u2019s what his qualities are. He wants to run towards goal and he wants to score.\u201d\n\nPotter said his team had not practised the move for Connolly\u2019s second goal, a jink in from the left in a manner similar to one of Serge Gnabry\u2019s efforts on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to say to our players: \u2018Be Bayern Munich players.\u2019\u201d", "description": "A serious injury to Hugo Lloris in the early stages made for an \u2018emotional game\u2019, said the Spurs manager after losing 2-1 at Brighton, a fourth defeat in five games", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5777a8fc26f701092c904cb36e8db719896b6440/0_140_2754_1653/master/2754.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e97627a7c428304b5b55bfb5450e80ab", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
