The challenger turns to the president and charges: \u201cYou asked the Ukrainian president to investigate your opponent\u2019s son\u2019s shady business dealings.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cyou released the transcript of your phone call last year with him in which you said, \u2018there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then you said, and I quote, \u2018Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, arriving at his rhetorical crescendo, the nominee declares victoriously, \u201cHorrible? What\u2019s horrible wasn\u2019t me as vice president using the threat of withholding $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees that Ukraine needed to stay solvent to get the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating my son\u2019s client fired. No, what\u2019s horrible is a president of the United States using the power of his office to dig up foreign dirt on a political opponent.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t quite work, does it?", "description": "", "authors": ["Thomas Mcardle", "Issuesinsights.Com The-Transcript-Is-Damning-To-Biden-Not-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
