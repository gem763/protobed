Still, the creators\u2019 inquisitive spirit lives on in the form of two Dutch YouTubers, who were arrested on September 10 for walking into the secure government site.\n\nAccording to the Nye County Sheriff\u2019s Office, vloggers Ties Granzier, 20, and Govert Charles Wilhelmus Jacob Sweep, 21, walked three miles (!) into Area 51 before they were detained and questioned. Upon their detainment, Granzier and Sweep granted the authorities permission to review their footage, which I have to imagine means that the footage is now gone forever.\n\nIn classic influencer style, Ties posted a photo to Instagram stating his plans to break into Area 51 before going on to break into Area 51. (Many of the comments now read #freeties.) Ties and Sweep told officials they had seen and understood the many \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs posted at the site, but had \u201cwanted to see the facility\u201d anyway. Can\u2019t argue with that! I remain inspired and smugly annoyed by Gen Z\u2019s renewed fervor for Area 51, the most basic of all alleged UFO bases.\n\nWhat did Ties and Govert Charles Wilhelmus Jacob see in there? I eagerly await their 17-minute-but-largely-uninformative YouTube video, whenever it is they\u2019re released from alien jail.", "description": "Dutch vloggers Ties Granzier, 20, and Govert Charles Wilhelmus Jacob Sweep, 21, were arrested this week after breaking into Area 51, recently the site of a planned \u201cambush\u201d and music festival.", "authors": ["Katie Heaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/12/12-area-51-arrests.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
