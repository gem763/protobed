Her opening statement accused the White House and State Department as operating US diplomacy in service to personal interests rather than national interests, and called her removal a result of \u201ctotally fictitious\u201d allegations from allies of Rudy Giuliani:\n\nMs. Yovanovitch\u2019s searing account, delivered at the risk of losing her job, could lend new momentum to the impeachment inquiry that imperils Mr. Trump. She said undermining loyal diplomats would embolden \u201cbad actors\u201d who will \u201csee how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system\u201d and serve the interests of adversaries, including Russia. \u201cToday we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d she said. She said the allegations that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump, circulated by allies of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, were totally \u201cfictitious.\u201d \u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d she said. But people associated with Mr. Giuliani \u201cmay well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u2026 She warned that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats\u2019 judgment, threatening to undermine the nation\u2019s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service.\n\nOn the other hand, Yovanovitch might not have moved the ball forward by much, at least not for now:\n\nHer opening statement revealed no new details about Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Volodymyr Zelensky, the new president of Ukraine, to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joseph R. Biden Jr. It also offered no details about Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, two businessmen who helped Mr. Giuliani mount a campaign for her removal. Both were arrested late Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations. The indictment charged that they were working for one or more Ukrainian officials who wanted her out of Kiev.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a long day for Trump and Mike Pompeo.\n\nOriginal post follows \u2026\n\n======\n\nSurprise, surprise, surprise. Despite repeated declarations from the White House that they would not cooperate with impeachment investigations until a full House vote to authorize them, the star witness du jour arrived moments ago anyway. Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch entered into the Capitol building on her way to sit down with three committees looking into Ukraine-gate:\n\nJUST IN: Former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry, despite White House assertion that the Trump admin. would no longer cooperate with the inquiry. pic.twitter.com/yORV3XCyPV \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) October 11, 2019\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has arrived on Capitol Hill for a deposition in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry despite President Donald Trump\u2019s position that his administration won\u2019t cooperate with the probe. Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in May and is now a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. Trump said earlier this week that he would block officials from testifying. Democrats are investigating Trump\u2019s direct pleas to Ukrainian officials to launch investigations of political rival Joe Biden and his family. The Associated Press reported Thursday that a former diplomat, recalling a recent conversation with Yovanovich, said she was removed after insisting that the requests for investigations be relayed according to long-established protocol. Yovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv in May as Rudy Giuliani \u2014 who is Trump\u2019s personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government \u2014 pushed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against the Bidens.\n\nIt\u2019s curious that the administration never applied their executive privilege to Yovanovitch. NBC News points out that her still-current boss Mike Pompeo explicitly threatened to exclude her from House questioning after their threats last week, especially with their conditions that attorneys could not be present. \u201c[T]he committee has not issued any subpoenas for depositions,\u201d Pompeo wrote at the time, \u201cand we are not aware of any other authority by which the committee could compel appearance at a deposition.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Yovanovitch showed up anyway. Either she\u2019s defying Pompeo to testify or Pompeo and Donald Trump figure a fight over her testimony isn\u2019t worth the political capital it would expend. Either option would be rather strange, but the latter especially. They had no trouble telling Gordon Sondland to hold out for a subpoena, even though they think his testimony isn\u2019t likely to be damaging, so why not Yovanovitch?\n\nAt any rate, House Democrats got what they want, or at least what they think they want. What happens if everyone\u2019s wrong about Yovanovitch and she has more to say about the Bidens than has been assumed? That\u2019s the only way that the White House\u2019s lack of action here makes any sense.\n\nUpdate: Will the White House be as accommodating with Bill Taylor?", "description": "\"This is a very serious person.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/msnbc-yovanovitch.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
