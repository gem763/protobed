It will not get the Federer-Rafael Nadal final that bubbled in its daydreams.\n\nOn the other end, a precipitous comeback continued, strangely enough. A 28-year-old man figured out some things to raise his record against Federer to 1-7. Grigor Dimitrov, of all people, surged to a fresh and eccentric semifinal with Daniil Medvedev by outlasting Federer, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. In one of those moments when the lightbulb goes on and signals athletic breakthrough, Dimitrov said, \u201cI was more present, to be honest. I was more of myself throughout every point, every game that I played.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSerena Williams cruises into semifinals of U.S. Open with her 100th career win in the event\n\nSo on the gloomy side Federer, having exited in an injury timeout before the fifth set, said, \u201cYeah, but this is Grigor\u2019s moment and not my body\u2019s moment, so . . . It\u2019s okay.\u201d He would mention something about his upper back and neck. His lifelessness in the fifth set would suggest something restrictive.\n\nAnd on the giddy side Federer\u2019s friend and sometime practice partner, Dimitrov, joined the list of those who have left the Arthur Ashe Stadium fans bummed during Federer\u2019s 11 years without a title here. They are names like Juan Martin del Potro (twice), Novak Djokovic (thrice), Tomas Berdych, Tommy Robredo, John Millman.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov? He came here at No. 78 after spending about six years entirely in the top 40, a big chunk of that in the top 20 and the cusp of 2017 and 2018 way, way up at No. 3. He got to New Year\u2019s Day 2019 at No. 19, yet hit a nadir in July in Atlanta with a 7-5, 6-4 loss to Kevin King, an Atlantan who can play tennis better than much of the planet yet ranked No. 405 as he played Dimitrov.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYeah, it was not a pretty time. I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d Dimitrov said from his happy seat as a Grand Slam semifinalist for the third time, following upon gutty efforts against Djokovic in the 2014 Wimbledon semifinals (four sets) and Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open semifinals (five sets). \u201cIt was that low that I don\u2019t even want to go there anymore. I was just obviously injury, losing points, ranking. That\u2019s the lowest point of any player.\u201d\n\nIt was low, low, low enough that he turned up here forgotten, beat No. 77 Andreas Seppi, got a walkover when No. 12 Borna Coric withdrew, beat No. 94 Kamil Majchrzak, beat the rising Australian No. 38 Alex de Minaur, and turned up opposite Federer.\n\nFederer had lost sets in each of his first two matches, but had blazed through No. 58 Daniel Evans and No. 15 David Goffin in hasty, go-for-a-beer-and-miss-half-of-it matches. Then on a strange night \u2014 really? \u2014 he wound up saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just a missed opportunity to some extent that you\u2019re in the lead, you can get through, you have two days off after. It was looking good. But got to take the losses. They\u2019re part of the game. Looking forward to family time and all that stuff, so . . . Life\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo. 1 Naomi Osaka loses at U.S. Open to Belinda Bencic\n\nIt\u2019s a missed opportunity in that No. 1 Djokovic had already retired mid-match and left 48 hours earlier, leaving Stanislas Wawrinka as the winner and refurbished bulwark. Only now Wawrinka couldn\u2019t solve the hottest player of the summer, the overworked Medvedev, losing 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, and now the U.S. Open has a semifinal without any of the sport\u2019s big three.\n\nIt has this because Federer made 61 unforced errors to Dimitrov\u2019s 41, and because Federer converted just four of 14 break points, and because Federer lost his service in the first games of both the fourth and fifth sets, and because it all looked so peculiar. \u201cStart of the fourth wasn\u2019t ideal. Start of the fifth wasn\u2019t ideal. That was running behind,\u201d Federer said, as if his body language hadn\u2019t said it before.\n\nStill, they tangled in two fourth-set games chockablock with twists. With Federer serving at 2-4, they played a 22-point behemoth with eight deuces and seven break points for Dimitrov, all lost. Federer held on there, but Dimitrov would say later, \u201cI think even when I lost that game, I was actually smiling going through the changeover because I was, \u2018That game must have hurt him a lot.\u2019 For me, it actually lifted me up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter all, he said, \u201cOne of the only things for me was try to keep him as much as possible on the court. I did that very well.\u201d\n\nThen, with Dimitrov serving for the set at 5-4, they played another doozy. Dimitrov slid behind love-40. Federer held five break points in all. Dimitrov beat those back with a 111-mph service winner, a 124-mph ace, an inside-out forehand straight from heaven to the open court, a Federer error when he seemed to go for too much with a backhand up the line, and a netted Federer backhand. On the first set point going the other way, Federer lifted a forehand long, and shortly after 11 p.m., the crowd had a fifth set it didn\u2019t necessarily want but seemed primed to enjoy. It would be Federer in a fifth set, a province he knows well here and everywhere.\n\nEverything careened awkwardly from there. Federer went to the trainer and returned. He fell behind 4-0, giving the sight and sound of a dissipating crowd trying to use a few loud voices to lift a beloved 20-time Grand Slam champion. Of the 17 points Dimitrov served in the fifth set, Federer got one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, gone again, Federer wound up saying of Dimitrov, \u201cI thought he was tough off the baseline. He mixed up well, which gave me all sorts of problems with the rhythm. Could never really feel comfortable off the baseline. That\u2019s something in the past I\u2019ve always been able to dominate, I\u2019d say. That was not the case tonight. He did a good job there.\u201d\n\nAnd Dimitrov would say of Federer, that in addition to all the other talents and qualities, \u201cI think one of the best qualities I\u2019ve always admired in him is moving on. Doesn\u2019t matter what kind of point he\u2019s playing, winning, losing, he just moves on. That\u2019s a hell of a quality to have.\u201d\n\nSo again, he moves on.\n\nAD", "description": "The 78th-ranked Dimitrov overtakes the beloved 20-time grand slam champion for first time, depriving the Open of a potential Federer-Rafael Nadal dream final.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7mWXNmEP5jJjXNuvu-xvEapYPHQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOQTO5GO3MI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
