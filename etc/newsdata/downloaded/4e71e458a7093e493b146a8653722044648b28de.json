But it wasn\u2019t the idea of Trump in cahoots with a foreign leader that angered Mudd\u2014it was the idea of the intelligence community ratting him out for it.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that an official in the U.S. intelligence community was so disturbed by the president\u2019s communication with a foreign leader that the official filed a whistleblower complaint with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general. While the IG found the matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d something that requires Congress to be notified, the acting Director of National Intelligence has refused to share details of the complaint.\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s Cuomo Prime Time moments after the Post\u2019s report dropped, Mudd\u2014a former CIA analyst\u2014immediately condemned the whistleblower\u2019s alleged actions.\n\n\u201cBoy, I\u2019m about ready to blow a gasket\u2014that is extremely unusual,\u201d Mudd howled. \u201cCan you explain to me, A, why it\u2019s the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s responsibility to listen to the president of the United States speaking to a foreign leader and, B, why did the U.S. intelligence community\u2014under the rules provided by the Democrats in Congress\u2014are responsible to report to the Congress what the President of the United States says.\u201d\n\nCuomo, somewhat taken aback by Mudd\u2019s criticism, wanted to confirm that Mudd didn\u2019t \u201clike that somebody snitched on the president.\u201d\n\nMudd went on to say that the only whistleblower issues with the intel community should revolve around in-house policing such as misuse of funds, prompting Cuomo to wonder what they should do if the president promised something that was \u201cover the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the heck is over the line?!\u201d Mudd shouted. \u201cThe president can say what he wants to Putin, he can say what he wants to Kim Jong Un!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe president can say what he wants. It\u2019s not the responsibility of the intel guys to go police the president and go snitch on him to the Congress. Ridiculous!\u201d\n\nThe former CIA official then praised acting DNI Joseph Maguire for his refusal so far to share details of the complaint to Congress. Cuomo, meanwhile, felt that this represented checks and balances.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d Mudd scowled, adding: \u201cI am ticked off. This is completely inappropriate. The Congress should not be asking the intel guys to go snitch on the president. No!\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe president can say what he wants to Putin, he can say what he wants to Kim Jong Un!\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568859825/cuomo-prime-time_9_zrwwkb", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
