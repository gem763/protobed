Yahoo News asked Trump if he was \u201cat all concerned\u201d about the Giuliani probe when the president spoke to reporters before departing the White House for an event in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so because I think Rudy is a great gentleman,\u201d Trump said.\n\nGiuliani, who plays a dual role as Trump\u2019s lawyer and television advocate, is a central figure in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. In a phone call on July 25, Trump encouraged the president of Ukraine to talk with Giuliani about potentially investigating the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son in that country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry late last month in response to a whistleblower complaint about the call, and in response to reports that $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was withheld as Trump pushed the country\u2019s leader to investigate the Bidens.\n\nTwo of Giuliani\u2019s business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on Oct. 9 and charged with illegally trying to funnel foreign contributions into U.S. political campaigns. Giuliani has said Parnas helped him plan an aborted trip to Ukraine, where he had hoped to gather information about the Bidens. Federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani\u2019s relationship with the two men and whether it potentially violated lobbying laws. On Friday, Politico reported that the investigation expanded beyond FBI agents and federal prosecutors in New York City to include the criminal division of the Department of Justice in Washington. Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPresident Trump speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.

He also suggested Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine were simply an attempt to root out \u201ccorruption\u201d in that country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a great crime fighter. He looks for corruption wherever he goes,\u201d Trump said of Giuliani, adding, \u201cEverybody understands Ukraine has big problems in that regard. Rudy Giuliani is a fine man. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York and he\u2019s been one of the greatest crime fighters, corruption fighters.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke to reporters, Trump dismissed the impeachment inquiry as \u201ca hoax\u201d and \u201ca disgrace.\u201d The president and his allies have criticized the inquiry because Trump has not yet been given a chance to question witnesses, and some testimony on classified matters has been given in secure facilities on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThings are going very well,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know people are still in a basement \u2014 in a secure room in the basement trying to make us look as bad as possible, but that\u2019s not working too well.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The president suggested Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine were simply an attempt to root out \u201ccorruption\u201d in that country.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eWZlwtgPGkmG6Ca3RD8CCA--~B/aD0yNDczO3c9MzcwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/7bf6d230-f748-11e9-beff-41bbd1015a93", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
