Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a new interview that her quick rise to political fame hasn\u2019t all been easy and sometimes she just wants to be treated like a normal human being.\n\nThe 28-year-old Democratic socialist, who went from being a bartender in the Bronx to becoming the new face of the ultra-left wing of the Democratic Party, told HuffPost that she feels a great deal of empathy for people like Meghan Markle who are thrust into the media spotlight and ruthlessly scrutinized.\n\n\u201cSometimes I just want to be a human being. And you don\u2019t get to be a human anymore,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday. \u201cEverything you do from wearing sweatpants to the bodega to getting a haircut \u2015 every personal decision you make for yourself is never going to be yours anymore.\n\n\u201cYou kind of grieve for that. It has its highs and it has its lows,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people look at the highs, but sometimes it feels like you got a tattoo on your face that you didn\u2019t ask for. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very hard. Sometimes you just want to get a drink or eat a hamburger.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about dealing with fame on Friday in response to comments made by Ms. Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, about how everyday life had been extremely difficult for her because of the media attention.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, \u201cSudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience. There\u2019s a part of your life that you lose, & it later dawns on you that you\u2019ll never get it back. The people who treat you like a human make all the difference.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez told HuffPost that she feels \u201can enormous amount of empathy\u201d for Ms. Markle because \u201cit requires an enormous amount of tools to be resilient\u201d in her situation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are going to say \u2018oh, boo-hoo,\u2019 but I feel for her,\u201d she said. \u201cI really feel for her.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
