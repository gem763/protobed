As the Amys introduced him, he stood up and stuck out his hand. He didn\u2019t speak any English, but smiled and offered a chair and his business card, which had his information in Chinese characters on one side and in English on the other. He didn\u2019t seem suspicious, nor ask any personal questions.\n\n\u201cThis is our head office,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 30 branch companies in China.\u201d\n\nHe spoke for a few minutes about his business, but the Amys\u2019 translation skills quickly petered out without revealing how many chemicals Ye\u2019s company manufactures itself. Salespeople said they had two factories, one in Shenzhen and one in Wuhan. \u201cOur factory [in Shenzhen] is the only NPP plant in China,\u201d Chen Li told me over Skype in December 2017, before noting that production had been discontinued. He said the Shenzhen factory had also been producing 4-ANPP, and that it was not open to outsiders.\n\n\u201cMost of the steroids we make at our own factory,\u201d said one of the Amys. \u201cNot all\u2014most of.\u201d It too was off-limits. \u201cWe cannot go into the laboratory. Our boss say, for safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor security,\u201d added the other Amy.\n\n\n\nIn February 2019, I called Ye Chuan Fa and revealed my identity as a journalist, speaking to him through an interpreter. He didn\u2019t deny selling fentanyl precursors: \u201cAnything that the country schedules, we don\u2019t sell. As long as it\u2019s scheduled, we won\u2019t sell it. If it\u2019s not scheduled, we can sell it.\u201d\n\nHe did claim, however, to be uninformed about these chemicals\u2019 use. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much about these things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe make raw materials. Not finished products. We are factory to factory.\u201d I disputed this assertion\u2014that his enterprise sold only to other companies\u2014noting that numerous Yuancheng salespeople had tried to sell me precursors as an individual.\n\nI inquired about the other, still-unscheduled fentanyl precursors Yuancheng salespeople were still trying to sell me, but he denied knowledge of these chemicals. When I asked him why Yuancheng mailed some of its chemicals in disguised packaging, with the promise to evade customs, he went uncharacteristically silent.\n\nRead: Naloxone has made overdosing less terrifying\n\nAfter I said goodbye to Ye at the office in January, my tour with the Amys continued downstairs. There, they offered a surprising revelation: The workers live on the premises, in dormitory-style rooms housing four to seven people, on average. In fact, the Amys were roommates. They presented the personnel department, and then, on the bottom levels, a pair of canteens where employees take meals. Inside the kitchen, the Yuancheng company chef chopped up meats and vegetables for that night\u2019s dinner with a large cleaver.\n\nDorm environments like these are not uncommon at Chinese companies, and the free room and board is part of Yuancheng\u2019s sales pitch. Its ads promise that successful employees will be able to \u201cbuy a car within 10 years and a house within 20\u201d\u2014considered particularly desirable traits among singles\u2014and many ads mention a variety of perks, including free cellphones, a pension, the possibility of domestic and foreign travel, \u201coccasional dinner parties,\u201d and \u201csix types of insurance.\u201d", "description": "Yuancheng used an army of young, perky salespeople to peddle illegal chemicals to Americans.", "authors": ["Ben Westhoff"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Yuancheng_Headquarters/facebook.jpg?1566137265", "published_at": "2019-08-18"}
