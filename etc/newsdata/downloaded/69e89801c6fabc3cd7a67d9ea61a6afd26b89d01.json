In fact, estimates say that 20-40 million people are enslaved across the globe, earning criminals profits of approximately $150 billion a year.\n\nThe problem is unlikely to go away altogether, but what if emerging technologies such as blockchain and increased data sharing could make it harder for criminals to traffic victims and make it easier and quicker for authorities to save them?\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem?\n\nBefore we start looking at how technology can help solve the problem, it\u2019s important to understand what human trafficking is and how criminals operate.\n\nThe term refers to the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labour, commercial sexual exploitation, or sexual slavery. Victims are often lured by false promises of lucrative work, stability, education, or a loving relationship.\n\nAlthough the crime spans all demographics, there are some instances or vulnerabilities that lead to increased susceptibility. For example, runaway and homeless youth, victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, war, conflict, or social discrimination are usually more heavily targeted by traffickers.\n\nThey control and manipulate these individuals by leveraging the non-portability of many work visas as well as the victims\u2019 lack of familiarity with their surroundings, laws and rights, language fluency, and cultural understanding.\n\nIt\u2019s often difficult for victims to get help as traffickers may confiscate their identification documents (if they have them to begin with) and money.\n\nHow can blockchain help?\n\nHuman trafficking is a complex and heartbreaking problem.\n\nIf we consider the issue from the point of view that potential victims have few resources and lack any form of identification, we can get a real sense of how blockchain can help.\n\nWe live in an increasingly digital age, and as such, the notion of every citizen having a digital ID is not so far fetched as it was several decades ago.\n\nImagine, for example, that someone\u2019s virtual identity is created on a private blockchain using unique biometric information such as a fingerprint, or an eye scan.\n\nOnce this is saved on a blockchain, the information is immutable and as such can not be forged, meaning traffickers wouldn\u2019t be able to tamper it or change a victim\u2019s identity. A strategy often used by traffickers to get their victims across border controls.\n\nImportantly, blockchain technology is also decentralized, meaning that the embedded data is far more secure than it would be on a centralized server.\n\nAs a borderless technology, blockchain ID documentation and tracking can take place anywhere \u2014 so long as the parties involved are able to cooperate and collaborate while pledging to input the correct data.\n\nThe industry is still nascent, but the application of blockchain in tackling social issues such as human trafficking is both feasible and sustainable.\n\nHuman trafficking is a serious issue and as such the quest for a solution must be done so responsibly. Touting blockchain\u2019s potential simply because it\u2019s become trendy is a huge disservice to victims but also hampers the technology\u2019s long-term success.\n\nHaving said this, the severity of the challenge warrants all explorations and blockchain could indeed be part of the solution \u2014 but it\u2019s important to remember it doesn\u2019t necessarily hold all the answers.\n\nWe\u2019ll be exploring how blockchain tech can curb child trafficking and modern-day slavery and what the challenges of doing so are at Hard Fork Summit.
