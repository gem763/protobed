So I came clean about it", "language": "en", "text": "Teaching was my dream job, writes Yasha Hartberg. But how would students react to a professor who could barely keep his life together?\n\nIn the fall of 2016, I landed a part-time job teaching writing to pre-med majors at Texas A&M University. In 2017, this turned into a dream, full-time position, and it seemed like my life was finally falling into place. Just a semester later, though, at the start of 2018, I experienced the worst panic attacks of my life.\n\nI was holding things together at work, mostly, but a few times each week I closed my office door, turned off the lights, and crawled under my desk to bawl. I constantly suffered near-paralyzing fear, and it was affecting my students. I debated what it would mean to tell my class. Would students no longer respect me as an instructor?\n\nI finally decided to share what I was going through, but, in nearly 20 years of teaching, I\u2019d never been more terrified to be in front of students.\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what I said at the end of class that day, but I tried to describe the situation straightforwardly.\n\nSome of you, no doubt, have noticed that the class isn\u2019t going smoothly. Readings haven\u2019t been posted on time. Due dates for assignments have sometimes been confusing. I haven\u2019t been getting feedback to you as quickly as I\u2019d like. I pride myself on being on top of things, so I feel you deserve an explanation.\n\nThe explanation was this: for months, pressure had been building on me from so many different directions that it was almost inevitable that something would give.\n\nEver since I was a kid I had dreamed of getting a doctorate. I finally accomplished that goal, earning my PhD in biology in 2016. While immensely gratifying, that dream had come with a cost. I\u2019d taken out as much in student loans as many people borrow to buy a house. I had no idea how much my payments might be, and as the date for repayment drew nearer, I couldn\u2019t bear to find out.\n\nMeanwhile, I was just starting to come out of the closet. By the end of 2017, most of my closest friends knew the secret I\u2019d been hiding \u2013 even from myself \u2013 for 48 years. But many in my family didn\u2019t, and I was desperately afraid of their rejection.\n\nSince adolescence, cycles of anxiety and depression had been part of life, and they were predictable in their progression. If I just waited them out, they eventually dissipated.\n\nWhile they were miserable in the moment, I\u2019d come to look forward to a kind of rejuvenation I always felt at their end. However long they lasted, once the fog of depression lifted, I would be bursting with new ideas, filled with creative energy and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThis time, though, there was no end in sight, no resurrection, no rebirth. Death was becoming attractive. I knew I desperately needed help, and I knew it had to be now.\n\nEven though I have health insurance, the demand for mental health services far exceeds supply and, it turns out, the start of the new year is an especially terrible time to seek psychological care. Counselors are busy catching up with clients and post-holiday paperwork. Voice messages never get returned. \u201cFirst available\u201d was often two months or more away, hardly helpful when I couldn\u2019t see a future beyond two weeks. The choice between suicide and cold calling therapists may seem obvious, but I just didn\u2019t have the strength to be turned away again.\n\nMy students were the slender thread that stayed my hands from doing myself harm. What would happen to them if I killed myself? How would my sudden death disrupt their graduation plans? As for my colleagues, they were already stretched thin teaching their own classes. I couldn\u2019t burden them with more.\n\nAs hard as I\u2019ve tried not to let my personal life interfere with my professional obligations, as all of you know, sometimes life just becomes too large to compartmentalize.\n\nBefore reaching the point where I felt compelled to confess, I had caught a lucky break. A clinic called to let me know that a counselor had an unexpected opening. I just needed to hold on for another week for my first appointment.\n\nThe morning of my first session, I was terrified. In fact, I almost ran out of the clinic before I was finally called back to a cozy office.\n\nThe counselor introduced herself and started explaining her background and doctor-patient confidentiality while I scratched at a red spot on my thumb, already rubbed raw from a nervous tic I\u2019ve had since I was a kid. I had no idea where to begin, but fortunately I didn\u2019t need to. The counselor had prepared questions and answering them proved comforting \u2013 even though it meant divulging things I\u2019d never shared with anyone before. We scheduled weekly sessions, something to hold on to.\n\nI saw signs of improvement over the next couple of weeks \u2013 small, silly things to anyone not living in my head. Checking the mail is hardly herculean, but I had avoided my mailbox for two months fearing the bills inside.\n\nJust as things were looking up again, tragedy struck. My dad and stepmom had come to visit me the last weekend in January, an extremely rare treat. We\u2019d had a good time as I showed them my apartment, my new office, and some of my favorite restaurants. They were worried \u2013 I\u2019d let slip on social media that I was having panic attacks \u2013 but I deftly deflected any conversations that touched on my mental health.\n\nWe parted ways in the early afternoon. As they started the 200-mile drive back to Dallas, I hiked in the woods. About an hour later, still on the road, they tried to call me and I knew something must be wrong, especially since my mother, who was living in Nebraska, tried to call shortly afterward.\n\nI found a clearing in the forest with phone service and called my mom. It turned out that my 45-year-old sister, Molly, was in a coma in a Montana hospital, and no one really knew what was happening.\n\nIf things were desperate before that call, I don\u2019t know what words would describe the weeks that followed. Grief. Anxiety. Pressure. So much pressure. The dutiful son ripped to shreds from conflicting impulses. Mom all-but-asking me to stay away. Dad all-but-begging me to accompany him to see his daughter one last time.\n\nMy colleagues were supportive, offering to take over my classes if needed. I knew they were sincere, too, but that only heightened my anxiety. Academic jobs are hard to find and funding for my position wasn\u2019t stable. What would happen if it looked like I was unreliable?\n\nEven if I\u2019d been able to overcome that set of fears, the logistics proved too much for me to cope with in my emotional state. When your sister lies close to death 1,500 miles away, what is the best time to show up at her bedside? Is it five days into her coma, when she won\u2019t know you\u2019re there but there are still hopeful signs she might recover? Is it on day 11, when her eyes finally open, but she\u2019s at best only dimly aware of what\u2019s happening? Or would it be more supportive to save my limited vacation days to help with funeral plans if it came to that?\n\nWorst of all, I didn\u2019t feel it was right to burden my parents with knowledge of my mental health struggles when they were grieving the impending loss of their daughter.\n\nThe facades of health and happiness and professional detachment were collapsing in on me. The only way I could see to relieve the pressure was to let the world see my brokenness. In that moment, how the world reacted hardly seemed to matter. So I explained to my students what was happening.\n\nThe day before Valentine\u2019s Day, my younger sister passed away. About two weeks earlier she fell into a diabetic coma and, despite some false signs of hope, she was never able to recover. For over a month of this semester, I have been dealing with overwhelming uncertainty, worry and grief. I\u2019ve been suffering from major depression and anxiety. I\u2019ve started counseling, and I\u2019m starting to do better. I just felt you should know. As hard as y\u2019all work for my class, I felt you needed an explanation for why you haven\u2019t been getting my best.\n\nWhatever the consequences might be, at least I\u2019d been honest.\n\nTo my surprise, far from rejecting me, students stayed after class to tell me how sorry they were. They left condolence cards in my mailbox and sent emails to let me know they were praying for my family. They stopped by my office to check on me. Up to that point, I\u2019d been so caught up in my despair that it never occurred to me that I might be worthy of concern and support. Being accepted despite my flaws touched me in ways that are hard to express.\n\nWhat happened next, though, transformed me. In their condolences, students shared their own experiences with loss, grief, depression and anxiety \u2013 far more than I could have guessed for lives so young.\n\nEncouraged by their candor and support, I continued to open up. For instance, when I started antidepressants a few weeks later, I warned students before my lecture that I might be a bit loopy because I was experiencing distracting tingling sensations. I expected students might look at me as though I were crazy. Instead, I saw heads nodding in recognition. Soon, students showed up at office hours to thank me. They had never heard a professor expose that side of themselves. They saw their own struggles reflected in my vulnerability, and they saw something else, too. They saw hope.\n\nOur students struggle far more than we can imagine. We\u2019re often unaware of their difficulties, largely because we only see them for a few hours each week, often in large groups. At the same time, students are crafting walls of feigned invulnerability and confidence in emulation of the masks faculty wear. From freshman year to full tenure, academic life is lived under constant scrutiny. Is it any wonder we fear revealing anything that might be perceived as weakness?\n\nSince opening up about my mental health, students have given me a peek behind their facades, sharing their stories of grief and despair: the unexpected death of a parent, the suicide of a sibling, paralyzing panic, involuntary commitment to psychiatric hospitals, abusive relationships and more.\n\nImportantly, they don\u2019t view me as a counselor. While a few students have asked what to expect if they enter therapy, not one has asked me to help them work through psychological trauma. That\u2019s not my job, nor is it theirs when I describe my own issues \u2013 students understand and respect that.\n\nMostly, I believe they share their stories because they desperately need to be understood by those who are shaping their lives and their careers. Struggling to succeed while grappling with mental health issues is difficult enough. Keeping that struggle secret \u2013 especially from those who evaluate your performance \u2013 is exhausting. A barely passing grade separated from a student\u2019s lived experience seems like a mediocre effort. But in the context of crippling depression and anxiety, it becomes a monumental tribute to their dedication, drive and ability. When that same student earns an \u201cA\u201d, a letter grade hardly seems adequate to reflect the magnitude of their accomplishments.\n\nYes, part of our job as professors is to evaluate students\u2019 performance objectively and honestly, and we do our best to prepare them for the \u201creal world\u201d, which can be unforgiving of mental health struggles. But students already know that life is hard. Far more of them have learned this basic lesson more intimately than anyone would like to acknowledge.\n\nPerhaps, then, as teachers we should include in our lessons that it is possible to be successful even when life is hard. Students need to learn from our example, through our own authenticity, that mental illness does not sentence them to failure. Perhaps, above all, they need to learn that all of us deserve a little bit of grace.\n\nThis article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.", "description": "Teaching was my dream job, writes Yasha Hartberg.
