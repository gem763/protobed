Authorities said she was suffering from severe depression and are investigating suicide as a possible cause of death.\n\nSulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was one of a growing number of female South Korean singers and actors to have been targeted by online vitriol, often from anonymous male fans enraged by their idols\u2019 refusal to conform with social norms.\n\nHer \u201ccrimes\u201d had included live-streaming a drinking session with friends and her decision not to wear a bra in public. She also revealed that she was in a relationship at the zenith of her singing career, defying the industry\u2019s carefully crafted image of young female stars as sexually desirable but inexperienced.\n\nShe smashed other taboos, too, hosting a TV series about how online abuse had contributed to her anxiety disorder and social phobia, in a country with a strong cultural resistance to discussing mental illness.\n\n\u201cShe expressed her views about what was intrinsically wrong in our society about how female stars are supposed to behave,\u201d said Prof Yunkim Ji-yeong, an expert on Korean gender issues at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University in Seoul.\n\nThe messages of sympathy that flooded the internet after news of Sulli\u2019s death emerged on Monday also criticised the culture of South Korea\u2019s intensely competitive entertainment industry and the toll it takes on young performers.\n\nPromising stars are put through a gruelling training schedule as they pass along the conveyor-belt production of new girl and boybands. Young stars are subjected to strict controls over their private lives, including bans on dating, restrictions on mobile phone use and an expectation that they will sacrifice their health to achieve the desired image.\n\n\u201cI think a day where (people) would be ashamed of the K-show business will surely come,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cI think an industry that makes money by (making people) sing, dance, undergo plastic surgeries and go on a diet to please the gaze of others since they are teenagers should really go bankrupt.\u201d\n\nSulli was 11 when she began her career as an actor, before making her K-pop debut in 2009 for f(x), who quickly became one of the country\u2019s most popular girl bands.\n\n\u201cMany celebrities who debuted at young ages suffer from depression and anxiety as they have to live in the public eye. They can be vulnerable if they get too much attention,\u201d Park Jong-seok, the head doctor at Yonsei Bom Psychiatry in Seoul, told the Korea Times. \u201cThey go through adolescence without experiencing genuine friendships and stability with peer groups.\u201d\n\nA number of entertainment stars have killed themselves in the last decade. Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star, committed suicide in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse and exploitation by influential politicians, business and newspaper executives and industry figures.\n\nThe K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017; the singer and actor Goo Hara, once part of the girl band Kara, apologised to fans after being found unconscious at her home earlier this year.\n\nKwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, was subjected to cyber insults in 2009 while a member of the K-pop group Typhoon, after being wrongly identified in a sex video that was widely shared online.\n\nSulli\u2019s death has intensified demands for government action against bullying on popular internet portals where users are able to comment anonymously.\n\nThe website of the office of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was flooded with demands this week that users be required to register their real names before commenting. The national assembly will reportedly begin debating a bill, already dubbed \u201cSulli\u2019s law\u201d, later this year.\n\nSouth Korean politicians have previously shown a willingness to tackle other forms of abuse with the enactment this year of a law against workplace bullying \u2013 known as gapjil \u2013 with persistent offenders facing a prison sentence of up to three years or a maximum fine of US$25,000.\n\nThe public\u2019s appetite for action against those who torment celebrities online is also growing. A poll this week by Realmeter showed support for new legislation at almost 70%.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else\u2019s dignity is beyond that limit,\u201d said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cThere need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Nemo Kim in Seoul\n\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
