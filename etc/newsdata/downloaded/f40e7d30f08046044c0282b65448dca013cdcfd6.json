What it said is \u2018this who I am. I\u2019m not going to pretend to be anyone else. I\u2019m not shoving my religion down your throat but this is who I am\u2019.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nThe thing with the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d is he wants to deliver what he has promised \u2026 but not ruffle people who have had enough of politics. They don\u2019t want a whole lot of activism. They want it out of their faces.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nHe\u2019s the first Prime Minister since John Howard without a significant internal opposition in his party. That makes him more powerful. It strikes me that he\u2019s the first PM to be able to command almost absolute loyalty from his backbench since Howard.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nThere is no doubt Scott Morrison is the most powerful person in the country. Plainly his is a pre-eminent position. He\u2019s like a Lone Star.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nA lot of it has to do with his sunny personality, a sort of upbeat and optimistic personality. He offered hope at the election.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nHe would give Winx a run for its money. It\u2019s just that clear \u2013 he owns the space.\n\nJohn Scales\n\n2. Josh Frydenberg\n\nTreasurer\n\nLast year: 3\n\nJosh Frydenberg. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nOn the night before the May election, Scott Morrison texted his deputy to say that the result was \u201cin God\u2019s hands\u201d. But he knew a victory would be in no small part due to Frydenberg\u2019s efforts at tearing down Labor\u2019s retiree tax and proposed negative gearing changes, a campaign started months earlier during the summer break. The Treasurer and deputy Liberal leader has put himself in the box seat to deliver the first budget surplus since Peter Costello, and serves as the de facto head of a new generation of Liberals in Canberra. Critically, he is viewed as connected to the business world. While relations with the finance sector have been strained by the Hayne royal commission, Frydenberg\u2019s pedigree at Mallesons and Deutsche Bank help in the boardrooms of Sydney and Melbourne. Having moved up one place on the list since 2018, he is now faced with the fallout of the US-China trade war and worrying signs for the Australian economy more broadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nPeople tell me Josh is the guy that Scott would ring up to have a chat about something or come around and have a chat about this or that, more than anyone else.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nJosh is powerful in that he is one of the very few people left in Canberra who is a strong bridge to the business community. And I think that his period in Deutsche Bank has served him well.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nHe\u2019s very sensible. He\u2019s got very good networks in the corporate sector. He\u2019s had that corporate experience. Josh has spent considerable time building those relationships with business. And I hope he continues to do so.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nIt is interesting to think about the Prime Minister and Treasurer dynamic. Complementarity coupled with a degree of underlying tension. They\u2019re both genuine human beings who want to do the right thing.\n\nSandra Harding\n\n3. Gladys Berejiklian\n\nNSW Premier\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nGladys Berejiklian. Louise Kennerley\n\nJust the second female premier to be elected in her own right (after Anna Bligh in Queensland), and the first premier on the Power list since her NSW predecessor, Gladys Berejiklian seems to be in a tenuous spot. At the time of going to print she was facing the risk of being plunged into minority government over the messy debate on decriminalising abortion.\n\nYet the Power panel felt she earned her place on the list. Her model for electoral success \u2013 calmly delivering everyday services and infrastructure projects to help unclog Sydney \u2013 is matched by co-operation with business and the Coalition in Canberra. While her introverted and consensual style of leadership attracts criticism, the panel felt it was uniquely powerful. Whether she remains the most powerful woman in the country is in the hands of her colleagues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nGladys demonstrated through her work that she gets the job done. She\u2019s not someone who\u2019s out for the \u2018Me, me, me. Look at me\u2019 stuff. Yes, she has a problem on her hands with the abortion issue, but it will be dealt with.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nLook at her ministry and look at what she\u2019s done, and how. She\u2019s put some really clever, up and coming politicians in some of the big roles.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nShe is a growing influence within the party. One of the models of electoral success at the moment is what I\u2019d call managerialism \u2013 and if you look at [South Australian Premier] Steve Marshall, you look at [Tasmanian Premier] Will Hodgman and you look at Gladys, it\u2019s not normally about \u2018in your face\u2019 causes or dramatic reform, it is about getting on and doing the things that people want to see done. When they vary from that, political trouble follows as we have seen in NSW recently.\n\nBrian Loughnane\n\nGladys Berejiklian\u2019s position was always a bit politically precarious. Labor\u2019s appalling last week of that campaign had more to do with her win than anything positive she or her government was doing. NSW voters are the most disgruntled in the country.\n\nTony Mitchelmore\n\nShe\u2019s a reforming premier. I reckon Gladys will survive and thrive after the current hiccups, which will in fact increase her power.\n\nPaul Howes\n\n4. Philip Lowe\n\nRBA Governor\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nPhilip Lowe in the Reserve Bank vault at Martin Place. Louie Douvis\n\nNewly powerful by virtue of the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to reverse course on interest rates, Lowe is a respected one-man protective shield for the Australian economy, withstanding economic shocks stemming from political battles overseas \u2013 and even the odd drone strike against oil fields. Having held rates steady for 30 monthly meetings in a row, the RBA dropped rates in June, July and again in October \u2013 and markets are betting there are more cuts to come. Increasingly outspoken and high profile, the Reserve Bank governor brings a tenacious intellect and bold opinions, pushing back against the big banks and giving enhanced credibility to politicians from the Prime Minister and Treasurer down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nLowe has gone from low-down to becoming a really prominent figure in the national debate. His position has radically changed in the past few months.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nHe speaks relatively quietly and he\u2019s not strident in what he\u2019s doing but he\u2019s all the more powerful for it.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nWhy did Frydenberg have the big sit-down explanation with Lowe? Because they know he brings credibility to what they\u2019re saying and doing. Politicians know that they\u2019ve got less trust, and they know that the people have a natural respect for the credibility of these organisations that are independently authoritative, not driven by vested interests, to do what\u2019s good for Australia.\n\nJohn Scales\n\n5. Anthony Albanese\n\nOpposition Leader\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nAnthony Albanese. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nPreferring to be called \u201cthe Labor leader\u201d instead of \u201cthe Opposition Leader\u201d, Anthony Albanese has one hell of a clean-up job on his hands.\n\nTaking over after two terms waiting in the wings, he is putting the Shorten years behind the ALP and starting again on a long process of policy development and rebuilding in key states including Queensland and Western Australia.\n\nViewed as less anti-business than his combative predecessor, Albanese has to square up against an emboldened Scott Morrison and keep the Labor team united for another three long years of opposition. One win away from becoming prime minister, Albanese\u2019s power now lies in his potential and natural gifts, but it won\u2019t withstand another loss to Morrison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nWhen Labor installed Shorten as leader, I think they voted for the wrong person. In my view, the right guy\u2019s now got the job but at a completely appalling timing for him.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anyone smarter than him in that building. He is one of the smartest and most tenacious operators in politics. He is a survivor and a hard worker. He\u2019s one of the few in Labor, even though he\u2019s from the left traditionally, who has very strong relationships with the business community.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t like him. And people do like him so that makes him electable. But the problem he\u2019s got at the moment is having lost, the whole show\u2019s been diminished.\n\nTony Mitchelmore\n\nHe is a phenomenal politician and he\u2019s the type of guy who can win the support of the basket weavers in the Balmain Branch of the party but could also win the straw poll at the Australia Club.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nThe Liberals know there\u2019s potential here. They\u2019re characterising him as in the pocket of the unions, so they\u2019re making him a little cartoon. They are getting in early to ram that home.\n\nJohn Scales\n\n6. Peter Dutton\n\nHome Affairs Minister\n\nLast year: 7\n\nPeter Dutton. James Brickwood\n\nA year after his failed bid for the Liberal leadership, Dutton has barely missed a beat since the ouster of Malcolm Turnbull turned into the rise of Scott Morrison. The Queenslander remains one of the most powerful Coalition government ministers, sitting atop a sophisticated and far-reaching national security apparatus in the Home Affairs super-portfolio. He is a leading conservative in cabinet. Despite criticism from enemies within and without over his role in blowing up the party, he remains a calculated media operator and a powerful voice on policy implementation. Few in Parliament can outrage their opponents so deftly. Will those confidently predicting Dutton is done with leadership ambitions prove as unreliable as those predicting he\u2019d lose his seat? Dutton is entrenched on the list for another year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of discussion around Morrison and who has influence. Dutton has that. He captures attention, because when he speaks, people either love to listen or hate it. He gets attention regardless. In his portfolio, that\u2019s a very core interest of a lot of these quiet Australians.\n\nJohn Scales\n\nHe has the potential to be more powerful and influential given the prominence of national security and its importance in the wild, external world that we live in. The degree to which he focuses and is seen to focus on his portfolio responsibilities offers the promise of even greater influence.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nFor the government to be successful it just needs to focus on the economy and national security. Dutton is prominent. He is the leader of that national security side of things.\n\nTony Mitchelmore\n\n7. Mike Cannon-Brookes\n\nAtlassian boss\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nMike Cannon-Brookes. Louie Douvis\n\nThe only business leader to appear on the overt Power list since 2016, the Atlassian co-founder and self-made billionaire demands an audience whenever he speaks. Worth a cool $9.3 billion, Cannon-Brookes is an example to investors and business leaders alike and is not afraid to speak out on issues from climate change to poor standards of political leadership in Canberra. Active in Sydney\u2019s business community and regularly in the media, Cannon-Brookes is in the vanguard of corporate leaders bringing authority and dollars to solve the problems of carbon emissions. Faced with inaction from policymakers, he has regularly used his social media profile as an effective bully pulpit for important causes and wields independent power in a range of advocacy projects. He embodies the generational change taking place in Australia\u2019s most powerful boardrooms.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nMike Cannon-Brookes is the most powerful business leader in Australia at the moment and he\u2019s one of the few who is definitely crafting an agenda. Whether you agree with the agenda or not, he is one of the only outspoken business leaders willing to back a cause.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s self-made. He\u2019s come out of Australia. He\u2019s humble yet he\u2019s very focused on the issues that he\u2019s pushing. A number of top ASX-listed boards have had Mike Cannon-Brookes come and talk to them.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nIf you\u2019re acting or working with resources in particular, he is really clear about what he wants to achieve there. On the other front, he\u2019s incredibly supportive of investment in start-ups and technology.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nHe has mentored, and is very generous to, other entrepreneurs in the field. My sense is that he has a degree of independence that nobody else with that sort of profile has.\n\nSandra Harding\n\n8. Jacqui Lambie\n\nAnd Senate crossbenchers\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nJacqui Lambie. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nBarely back in her Parliament House office in the wake of the federal election, Tasmania\u2019s Jacqui Lambie moved quickly to make a deal on the Coalition\u2019s $158 billion tax-cut plan in July. She has returned to Canberra after resigning in the dual citizenship fiasco, and a deal quickly secured her the moniker of crossbench powerbroker \u2013 the result of a loose co-operation with the Centre Alliance and fellow minor parties \u2013 on who the government will depend to get almost all legislation passed. The former soldier is no longer a political novice and has a new strategic approach that could see her inherit Brian Harradine\u2019s status as a savvy dealmaker from the island state. Anyone unsure of Lambie\u2019s power need only ask Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann how the deals are done. They might learn something about the power of plain speaking as well.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nWhat Jacqui Lambie can deliver for Tasmania \u2013 and she makes no bones about is \u2013 is so overt. She\u2019s so bold in terms of her intentions and deliverables.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nI do think she\u2019s learned to be collaborative. She has changed a lot from the first time around and she understands her power. She\u2019s smarter and she\u2019s had some really good mentoring.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe speaks a very clear language, like Pauline Hanson, and people get that.\n\nJohn Scales\n\nThese quiet Australians we\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t think are just coal miners in Queensland. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re just Liberal voters either. I think they\u2019re Labor voters, like Howard battlers were people who came over from Labor. But when Jacqui Lambie looks down the camera and says, \u2018Just cut the attitude\u2019, there will be people cheering in their lounge room saying, \u2018Yes, we\u2019re sick of you being up yourselves\u2019.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\n9. Rod Sims\n\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman\n\nLast year: 9 (Covert)\n\nRod Sims. James Brickwood\n\nThe face of the powerful competition regulator since 2011, Sims is one of the most prominent figures wielding power between business, customers and policymakers in Australia. With a hand in ongoing debates over everything from the power of big technology platforms, the nation\u2019s energy supply, media ownership, corporate mergers and malfeasance, Sims is never far from the government\u2019s priorities. Thanks to a regular media presence, the economist and bureaucrat remains feared by business leaders thinking about cutting corners. The ACCC has been emboldened by the banking royal commission and anti-business sentiment in the community. Sims is widely trusted and respected and late last year the government extended his appointment to 2022.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nSims is a man for the times. He\u2019s pro-market and a bit business sceptic. Industry by industry is getting reshaped with an ACCC prepared to take on market power.\n\nMichael Stutchbury\n\nI would say Sims \u2013 along with ASIC chairman James Shipton and Philip Lowe \u2013 are economically the three most powerful men in the country. Particularly because the government does not have a clear macroeconomic direction or policy. It is not determining the shape of the economy to the degree that those three are and they are taking action and moving in a way that is far more influential than what Kennth Hayne recommended.\n\nPaul Howes\n\nHe has the levers to take the action. What we\u2019ve seen is the ACCC is doing it. They\u2019re stepping up and doing it.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Ita Buttrose\n\nABC chair\n\nLast year: N/A\n\nIta Buttrose on the Play School set. Louie Douvis\n\nNothing short of a media legend, Buttrose\u2019s appointment as chair of the public broadcaster received near universal endorsement in February. It was the beginning of the end for a rocky period under former chair Justin Milne and sacked managing director Michelle Guthrie, with Buttrose and boss David Anderson steadying the ship and lifting morale at the ABC. A former Australian of the Year and long-serving magazine editor, Buttrose was quick to stand up to the Coalition after police raids at the ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters, while placating some critics by acknowledging the problem of bias and the need for more diverse views among the ABC\u2019s army of taxpayer-funded journalists. Widely known and liked by the public, it will take a brave executive (or PM) to challenge her power.\n\nWhat the panellists say\n\nShe\u2019s an appointment of this government with the potential to work well with the government and to shape the conversation in a different way. It strikes me that she\u2019s been brought in to do that and I think she has the authority and the power to deliver.\n\nSandra Harding\n\nI saw her appointment as really clever by Morrison as a bridge to rebuild the trust within Canberra. She stood her ground in relation to the raids on journalists, which most people would have expected her to do.\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans\n\nThey say speak softly and carry a big stick. I\u2019m in and out of the ABC a reasonable amount and I can just feel the difference. Nobody\u2019s said anything, there\u2019s been no memo, but I think people can see it. I think they\u2019re more balanced, they\u2019re trying to appeal to a broader audience.\n\nAmanda Vanstone\n\nThe ABC is an incredibly powerful perspective for the Australian community. There are so many people for whom it\u2019s their sounding board, their source of information, news about everything. It is the equal major source of information for Labor voters and Greens. It is their singular perspective. She\u2019s the one at the head, leading and running it.\n\nJohn Scales\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
