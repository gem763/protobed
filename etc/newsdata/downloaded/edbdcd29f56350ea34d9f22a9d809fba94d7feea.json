It must have done, because it\u2019s a memory that has stayed with me for ever.\"\n\nNadiya said she learned about sex in a biology class and threw up in a sink in the science lab when she realised what had happened to her as a child.\n\n(Image: BBC / RAW / Phil Sharp)\n\nShe added: \"I've only told my sisters recently and, growing up, I had a close friend at school who I told. It turned out a very similar thing had happened to her.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to talk about it because it probably happens much more than we care to talk about.\n\n\"If that happened to my children, I don\u2019t even want to say what I would do\u2026 I have no words.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHer trauma even led her to consider taking her own life, which she saw as a \"bus ticket\" out of her torment.\n\nOne night she tried to overdose on tablets but was interrupted when her mother announced she was pregnant with her younger brother.\n\nNadiya previously revealed she had her first panic attack at 11 when school bullies flushed her head down the toilet .\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAs an adult she was diagnosed with a panic disorder, and her triggers can be as simple as a bathroom door opening, and Nadiya still gets flashbacks when she goes to the toilet.\n\nSpeaking on Loose Women, she said: \"Every time I go to the toilet, and I\u2019m 34-years-old, I cannot take that image out of my head. That image is always in my head. I\u2019ve tried for years to get rid of it but I can\u2019t.\n\n\"That was when I first had a panic attack - when my head was flushed down the toilet.\"\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
