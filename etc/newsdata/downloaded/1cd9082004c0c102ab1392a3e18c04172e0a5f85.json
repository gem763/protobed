The new version of the site significantly resembles IMDbPro, which is now prominently featured at the top of the webpage with the branding \u201cBox Office Mojo by IMDbPro.\u201d And according to the company, some information will be available only on IMDbPro, which costs $19.99 per month, or $149.99 for an annual membership.\n\nAmong the information now requiring a subscription are breakdowns of box office performance for various genres, and historical data for Hollywood studios; it\u2019s not clear what else may be locked behind the paywall, but among the data removed entirely from the free site are the ability to search for an individual\u2019s box office history by title, and box office history adjusted for inflation.\n\nA statement from IMDb says that the redesign was \u201cmade in response to customer feedback and usage patterns, which will continue to inform future feature launches.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Laverne Cox on Representation, IMDb Birth Name Policy (Video)\n\nBut if the company expected applause, it was likely disappointed by the negative reaction online. Complaints were made about the site\u2019s navigation, the removal of features such as inflation-adjusted figures, and the decision to move studio-specific release slates and compilations of each studio\u2019s box office performances behind a paywall that requires an IMDbPro subscription to access.\n\n\u201cUm. How to put this? I do not care for the new design of Box Office Mojo,\u201d \u201cBaby Driver\u201d director Edgar Wright said. \u201cPlease change back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow \u2013 @boxofficemojo redesigned their site & stripped out most of the functions that allowed me to do deep dive stuff on #Charting,\u201d Screenjunkies critic and producer Dan Murrell tweeted. \u201cStuff like estimated tickets sold, easy to find adjusted for inflation lists \u2013 GONE. It was amazing resource. Is this the cost of @IMDb partnership?\u201d\n\n\u201cBox Office Mojo just torpedoed itself and essentially removed everything that made it a must-visit site just to drive up IMDB Pro subscriptions,\u201d wrote Forbes box office reporter Scott Mendelson.\n\n\u201c@boxofficemojo please put your website back to the old format, the new design is awful,\u201d Anthony D\u2019Alessandro of Deadline said.\n\nAlso Read: IMDb's Revised Birth Name Policy Criticized by GLAAD and SAG-AFTRA\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so Box Office Mojo just changed their website layout, and there's one particular thing I don't like about it.\n\nIf you want to see an entire studio's upcoming slate, you have to create an IMDBPro account, which costs money! pic.twitter.com/cng4OVm6k3\n\n\u2014 Bumpy-san (SUPPORT ABOMINABLE!!!) (@AnimatioNintend) October 23, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate just how central and essential BOM is to the day-to-day lives of people in entertainment media and the film industry,\u201d wrote BuzzFeed News reporter Adam B. Vary. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Amazon wants more people paying for IMDbPro, so they moved a ton of BOM data to that service. But in the process, they\u2019ve seemingly erased a few major features that made the original BOM site so essential.\u201d\n\nWhile Wednesday\u2019s overhaul marks the first major BOM redesign since the IMDB purchase, it\u2019s not the first time the parent company has attempted to surprise users with huge changes. In 2014, Box Office Mojo unexpectedly disappeared from the Internet, with the site\u2019s URL redirecting to IMDb\u2019s box office page. After a massive backlash, the site was restored the next day without explanation from Amazon or IMDb.\n\nRead original story Box Office Mojo Criticized After Redesign That Includes a Paywall for Some Data At TheWrap", "description": "Box office analysts, critics and even a major filmmaker gave the thumbs-down Wednesday to a major redesign of Box Office Mojo that removed longtime options and moved some data to IMDBPro, parent company IMDb\u2019s subscription service.It\u2019s the first major overhaul of the site since IMDb, a subsidiary of", "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jF49SNWKiV8ET9kr6i0EoQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/b99df59dfe2f1518f1abd0c474f26e69", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
