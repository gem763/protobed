Even Fernando Alonso, his former team-mate at McLaren, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t send out a message on one day, and on the next day do the opposite. We all know the lifestyle that Lewis has, and that F1 drivers take 200 planes a year. You can\u2019t then say, \u2018Don\u2019t eat meat.\u2019\u201d\n\nHamilton was bullish in response on Thursday, explaining that he was making positive changes. Having been moved to make his initial statements by the David Attenborough documentary, Blue Planet 2, he said: \u201cIt made me sad to see the things we\u2019re not aware of. I\u2019m making a big push to be carbon-neutral by the end of the year. I don\u2019t allow anyone in my office, or my household, to buy any plastics. It all has to be recyclables, right down to things like deodorants and toothbrushes.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton has strongly defended himself against accusations of hypocrisy over his recent environmental stand, claiming that despite his constant global travel as a Formula One driver, he is taking several steps to ensure he ends the year carbon-neutral.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000214013363-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNadeZm0KzkFwpSYJhHDpPbQMI5hkDcUBB5qZKQzbZSY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
