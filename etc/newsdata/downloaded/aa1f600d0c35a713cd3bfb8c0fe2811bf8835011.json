Here\u2019s our pick of the best long-sleeved jerseys out there this season.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

We love the two-tone green version we tried but there\u2019s a good range of alternative shades if it\u2019s not your cup of tea. There are some clever details on this one which aren\u2019t immediately obvious \u2013 like the extra stretch in the arms and shoulders to aid the fit. A light water resistant finish will stop fine rain getting through and there\u2019s fleece fabric in the back and front panels to keep you warm.\n\nBuy now\n\nMorvelo fire thermoactive: \u00a380, Morvelo\n\nBritish brand Morvelo has given this excellent top a distinctly Spanish feel to warm up your winter. That blend of red, yellow and orange shades will brighten any ride. It\u2019s not the thickest top in our roundup but it will work well as an extra layer beneath a waterproof, or as a standalone in better weather. You get three pockets, some reflective detailing at the back and a comfortably high neck to beat draughts.\n\nBuy now\n\nStolen Goat orkaan everyday: \u00a3125, Stolen Goat\n\nStolen Goat reckon this could be the ultimate three-season jersey. It\u2019s got a weatherproof coating that beads of moisture simply run off, and the brand promises the effect won\u2019t diminish with washing. There\u2019s a nicely fleeced backing to the fabric along with that other winter jersey essential \u2013 a taller collar. The stand-out feature is the huge reflective panel over the rear pockets \u2013 it really stands out in headlights and is much bigger than the reflective strips most jerseys use.\n\nBuy now\n\nAltura firestorm long sleeve jersey: \u00a369.99, Altura\n\nThis no-nonsense offering from North Yorkshire proves you don\u2019t have to spend a fortune to get quality winter kit. Despite the bargain price tag it\u2019s not lacking features. There\u2019s a silicone gripper at the waist to stop it riding up, broad bands of reflective dots around the arms and at the tail, plus a fabric strip to prevent the wind getting through the full-length zip. Paired with a decent waterproof, this thick fleece-lined top will see you through anything winter can throw at you.\n\nBuy now\n\nCafe du Cycliste irma audax: \u00a3184, Cafe du Cycliste\n\nYes, this one\u2019s expensive but it\u2019s a great choice for any style conscious cyclist. We loved the longer arms which will tuck nicely into your gloves on chilly mornings. The merino mix fabric is soft to the touch, warm and breathable. The thicker panel down the front with its chevron pattern doesn\u2019t just look great, it also helps to trap air, giving your torso extra protection from the wind. It\u2019s got a large mesh pocket where you can carry bulkier items such as your gloves or rain jacket. There\u2019s also the usual three cargo pockets plus a zipped security section. An all grey version is available but the black colourway is our favourite.\n\nBuy now\n\ndhb aeron polartec rain defence: \u00a3130, Wiggle\n\nIs this a thick jersey or a thin jacket? We can\u2019t make up our minds. The label says jersey but it\u2019s got some very jackety features including a longer tail to keep road spray off your saddle. That\u2019s no bad thing, though. It uses Polartec\u2019s power shield pro fabric to keep the wind out and the drizzle at bay while allowing moisture to escape. Really bright fluo yellow tops like this are a sensible choice even on daytime rides in the darker months. It\u2019s a generous fit, meaning you can wear a base layer beneath it. We liked the addition of a simple storm flap over the two main rear pockets and there\u2019s an extra zipped pocket for your phone.\n\nBuy now\n\nCastelli fondo: \u00a390, Evans Cycles\n\nHere\u2019s a lovely snuggly jersey you\u2019ll be glad of in the colder weather. With a lightly fleeced lining it\u2019s a really good choice on dry but cold days. As usual with Castelli you\u2019ll probably want to size up to make it loose enough to add a base layer. It\u2019s also light enough to pair with a jacket or a gilet for when the conditions are a bit more changeable. We tried the black/fluo version and loved the stripes of yellow on the back and cuffs which help keep you more visible. There\u2019s a substantial neck guard to keep you from rubbing your neck on the zip, and more than enough room in the pockets to fit ride snacks, a phone and even a jacket.\n\nBuy now\n\nLe Col pro aqua zero pinnacle: \u00a3135, Le Col\n\nEvery item of Le Col clothing we have tried over the years has had a real quality feel about it \u2013 and this jersey is no exception. It uses thicker fabric than many of its rivals and has a nice big zip-puller you\u2019ll be able to grip with gloves on. The fleece backing to the material will keep you warm while the hydrophobic coating on the outside will help drizzle to bead and run off before it soaks through. The black and white colourway with its rear reflective stripe really stood out on the road. If you want something less monochrome, take a look at the jaw-dropping orange and blue alternative. The fit is very much on the racy side so you may want to go up a size from your usual.\n\nBuy now\n\nKalf Club eVent softshell: \u00a3100, Evans Cycles\n\nHere\u2019s another jersey with jacket aspirations. It\u2019s got a longer tail plus a storm flap to keep the rain out of those two large rear pockets. Unusually, there\u2019s a third, zipped pocket on the chest for your phone or wallet. The windproof eVent fabric has been treated with a durable water repellent coating to help keep out the damp, and there are stretchy inner cuffs to stop winter winds finding their way up the sleeves. The golden colour is certainly different and should help you to stand out on the road. It\u2019s one to consider if you don\u2019t want to buy both a soft-shell jacket and a long-sleeved jersey this winter.\n\nBuy now\n\nSantini Bordeaux Paris: \u00a379.99, Prendas Ciclismo\n\nBordeaux Paris was a brutal motor-paced bike race through France that fizzled out in the 1980s, and this classy jersey has a cartoon of a chap riding a \u201cDerny\u201d motorbike on the pocket panel to commemorate it. It\u2019s a top to wear on its own on warmer autumn or spring days, or beneath a jacket in the middle of winter. Lightly-fleeced on the inside, it\u2019s been stitched together by Santini in Italy and that unusual, almost herringbone pattern on the body is made up of a mass of tiny letter Bs and Ps. We reckon it would make a great Christmas present for the cycling history aficionado in your life.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Men's cycling jerseys\n\nYour choice of winter jersey will be largely dictated by the sort of riding you do. Our best buy from Sportful comes in at under \u00a3100 and is a great all-rounder that will work well on its own or beneath a rain jacket. Those who want to blast around the lanes for a couple of hours could do a lot worse than buy the sleek Le Col offering. If you\u2019re commuting or mile-munching take a look at the amazing value Altura which has room underneath for extra layers.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
