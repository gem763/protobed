He faced allegations over his overseas business dealings\n\nHis change of heart is rumored to stem from Biden, who was a front-runner to win the Democrat nomination, slumping behind Warren in recent polls.\n\nBiden is facing allegations by President Trump of wrongdoing in overseas business dealings, connected to his son, Hunter, and his time on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\nThe persistent accusations could undermine his argument that he's best positioned to defeat the president next year.\n\nElizabeth Warren, 70, has also faced controversy and is fending off new scrutiny of her biography in which she claims she was fired from a teaching job in 1971 because she was 'visibly pregnant'.\n\nShe later told an interviewer in 2007 she left the school due to not having the right certificates and decided to not go back to teaching after returning to graduate school.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, is pictured (above) speaking at the SEIU Unions For All Summit in Los Angeles earlier this month.

He has not been shy about that.\n\n'Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that's not happening anytime soon.'\n\nThere was speculation Bloomberg would run against Barack Obama in 2012, and he considered making a presidential run during the 2016 election, before endorsing Hillary Clinton.\n\nSenator for Vermont Bernie Sanders recently suffered a heart attack.
