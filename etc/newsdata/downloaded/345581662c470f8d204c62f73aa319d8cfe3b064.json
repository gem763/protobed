The Glazers have owned the club since 2005.\n\nWhile their position still stands, the recent choice of co-owner Kevin Glazer to put his 13 per cent stake in the Premier League club, worth \u00a3270million, on the New York Stock Exchange suggests it could changing.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWith one of the six Glazer siblings publicly testing the market in such fashion, certainly brings the Saudis back into the picture.\n\nUnited, who host Liverpool on Sunday, may be in crisis on the pitch - but the Saudis, headed by Crown Prince Salman, still want to invest in one of the globe's biggest football teams.\n\nHowever, Richard Glazer, who is not involved in the hands-on running of the club, may just be cashing in his assets.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThough, even if that is the case, should his surprise move be a profitable one, his four brothers and sister could follow suit.\n\nBefore the Glazer's sudden announcement this month, United's share price was around $15 and by close of play on Friday, it was close to $16 - clearly showing some interest from new investors.\n\nThat means United\u2019s present market value is $2.64b - or just over \u00a32b.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe current market value is a significant drop from their $3b valuation prior to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was given the managerial reins on a permanent basis. With share prices previously at the $20 mark.\n\nUnited's dreadful form on the pitch, combined with their loss of Champions League revenue, is being blamed for the dip.\n\nAnd, despite the evident problems under the Norwegian, United's brand name remains massive.\n\nA recent survey found one billion people worldwide have an interest in the club.\n\nAnd City experts predict the Saudis , or any other prospective buyers, would need to cough up at least $4b minimum to stand any chance of a successful takeover.\n\nA leading financial analyst said: \u201cIf United are worth $2.64b in terms of current share price, you\u2019d be looking paying at least $4billion to buy out the Glazers.\u201d\n\nIf the American owners want to listen to offers, that is.", "description": "United are preparing for another takeover bid as Saudi Royalty step up interest", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Harry Pratt", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20226314.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-PHOTO-Saudi-Arabias-Crown-Prince-Mohammed-bin-Salman-attends-a-meeting-with-US-Secretary-of.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
