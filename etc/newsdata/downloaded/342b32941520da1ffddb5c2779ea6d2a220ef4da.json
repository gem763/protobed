This Ukraine thing isn\u2019t going to end up producing a John Kasich presidential candidacy, is it?\n\nThen it really will be a national crisis.\n\nHe wants to know where the outrage is among Republicans over what Trump\u2019s accused is. Well, there\u2019s this guy:\n\nIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s as close as Senator Mitt gets to \u201coutrage.\u201d Pat Toomey allowed yesterday on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cit is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office, certainly, including a sitting president, to ask for assistance from a foreign country\u201d while stressing that we don\u2019t know the facts yet \u2014 even though Trump has now confirmed that he raised the Biden investigation in his July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nThat\u2019s about it from Senate Republicans so far. Some doubtless are lying low, hoping that the facts here turn out to be better than they seem. Others known to call out Trump in the past, like Ben Sasse, decided awhile back to trade their right to criticize him for his support in their upcoming Senate primaries.\n\nIn some cases, the answer to Kasich\u2019s \u201cWhere are the Republicans?\u201d question is \u201cLeaving Congress to get away from Trump\u201d:\n\nThree days later, [GOP Rep. Paul] Mitchell was awaiting a prime-time CNN appearance when he saw footage of Trump rallygoers chanting \u201csend her back,\u201d aimed at one of the congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Stunned, Mitchell said he scribbled question marks on a notepad to silently ask an aide: \u201cHow do I even respond to this on TV?\u201d But one of the final straws was the unwillingness of people in Trump\u2019s orbit to listen. Mitchell implored Vice President Pence, his chief of staff, Marc Short, and \u201cany human being that has any influence in the White House\u201d to arrange a one-on-one conversation between him and the president so he could express his concerns\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re here for a purpose \u2014 and it\u2019s not this petty, childish b\u2014\u2014t,\u201d Mitchell, 62, said in an interview in early September. Pence\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nTen days after the \u201csend her back\u201d incident Mitchell announced he was retiring, one of 18 Republicans so far this year to announce that they\u2019re leaving the House. If the Ukraine scandal metastasizes, that number will accelerate.\n\nThere\u2019s a third possible answer to Kasich\u2019s question, though: Where are the Democrats? Everyone understands that the congressional GOP is now a mix of Trump personality cultists and Trump skeptics who are terrified of wrecking their future in the party by criticizing him. Democrats have the opposite incentive, though \u2014 the more adversarial they are towards Trump, the more their base loves it. So why aren\u2019t they being more adversarial on the Ukraine matter? That\u2019s what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wanted to know yesterday, and it\u2019s what other Dems are whispering to the media about today:\n\n[I][nterviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers this weekend made clear that they believed the latest allegations had the potential to be singularly incriminating, with the potential to advance the impeachment drive just as it appeared to be losing steam. Not only do the allegations suggest that Mr. Trump was using the power of his office to extract political gains from a foreign power, they argued, but his administration is actively trying once again to prevent Congress from finding out what happened\u2026 Several first-term lawmakers who had opposed impeachment conferred privately over the weekend to discuss announcing support for an inquiry, potentially jointly, after a hearing scheduled for Thursday with the acting national intelligence director, according to Democratic officials familiar with the conversations. A handful of them declined to speak on the record over the weekend, with some still reluctant to go public and others looking for cues from Ms. Pelosi and their freshman colleagues\u2026 Strikingly, some traditionally cautious veteran Democrats said the party might have no choice but to move toward impeachment. They believe that Senate Republicans, who are clinging to their majority of 53 seats, would pay a political price for protecting Mr. Trump if they voted to exonerate him in the face of damning evidence of malfeasance and a House vote to impeach.\n\nSchumer is already trying to tighten the screws on McConnell over this, inviting Cocaine Mitch today to join him in asking the White House to release the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky and the whistleblower complaint. One key political mystery at the moment is what Democrats will do if the White House succeeds in withholding both documents. Can they possibly impeach him based on what the evidence is *alleged* to say, without seeing it firsthand themselves? If not, can they possibly *not* impeach him if he successfully stymies an investigation by withholding alleged evidence of wrongdoing? Imagine if they went ahead and impeached him and then the transcript and complaint came out and the evidence wasn\u2019t as damning as it was cracked up to be. Trump\u2019s instinct is to withhold information rather than supply it and risk being caught in a trap (e.g., refusing to sit for an interview with Mueller) so that\u2019s probably what he\u2019ll do here. Your move, Nancy.\n\nJohn Kasich calls out GOP for not pressuring President Trump to hand over the whistleblower complaint to the House Intel Committee and says he\u2019s very concerned. \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this we become like a banana republic and where are the Republicans? \"What are they \u2014 hiding?\u201d pic.twitter.com/WevF7yXZEk \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 23, 2019", "description": "Partisanship.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jk-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
