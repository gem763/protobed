On Oct. 17, 2019, the country's legalization of cannabis derivatives, including beverages, edibles, and vapes, will go into effect. Canada's current \"Cannabis 1.0\" recreational market legalized only cannabis flower, oils, plants, and seeds.\n\nDon't expect the Cannabis 2.0 market to take off immediately, though. Companies must file a notice with Health Canada 60 days in advance before beginning to market new cannabis products. This means that the first cannabis derivatives products will be available for sale in mid-December.\n\nDeloitte estimates that the Cannabis 2.0 market could be worth 2.7 billion in Canadian dollars (a little over US$2 billion). Which stocks are poised to profit the most in the expanded Canadian recreational pot market? Here's why Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC), Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB), and HEXO (NYSE: HEXO) could be the biggest winners.\n\nCannabis leaf in front of a Canadian flag More\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Canopy Growth\n\nCanopy Growth has been talking about the potential for cannabis-infused beverages at least since big alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands bought an initial 9.9% stake in the company back in 2017. In Canopy's fiscal 2020 first-quarter conference call in August, CEO Mark Zekulin reaffirmed the company's belief that cannabis beverages will \"expand the cannabis consumer category to reach a larger portion of the population.\" The company plans to market multiple cannabis beverages later this year, including zero and low-calorie drinks.\n\nBut don't think for a second that Canopy Growth's Cannabis 2.0 focus will be limited to beverages. Zekulin noted in the company's Q1 call that Canopy occupies a former Hershey chocolate factory. He said that Canopy will roll out a variety of cannabis edibles, particularly including chocolate products.\n\nThe company could also shine in the vapes market. Canopy has conducted significant market research into vaping to develop devices that it thinks will be differentiated from current vape products. The company plans to launch over 15 new vape-related products in December.\n\nMany investors have focused primarily on Canopy Growth's recent struggles, particularly its huge net loss in the last quarter. However, probably no company has dedicated as much time and money toward the forthcoming Cannabis 2.0 market as Canopy has. I expect that Canopy Growth and its stock will reap the rewards from this effort.\n\n2. Aurora Cannabis\n\nAurora Cannabis is taking a somewhat different approach to the Cannabis 2.0 market than Canopy Growth is. Although Aurora is developing cannabis-infused beverages, chief corporate officer Cam Battley said in the company's Q3 conference call in May that it anticipates \"a relatively low market share of these products\" and isn't rushing into the beverages market.\n\nThe company isn't hesitant about launching cannabis edibles, though. Battley stated that Aurora plans to roll out a variety of edibles products, including hard baked goods, chocolates, and mints. Aurora CEO Terry Booth mentioned that there could also be an opportunity for organic edibles and sugar-free edibles.\n\nIn the U.S., vape products have been huge winners. Battley thinks that vape products in the Canadian Cannabis 2.0 market will also be \"a terrific market segment that doesn't need a lot of market development.\" Aurora has partnered with Pax Labs to market its Pax Era vape devices in Canada.", "description": "Cannabis derivative products are on the way in Canada.
