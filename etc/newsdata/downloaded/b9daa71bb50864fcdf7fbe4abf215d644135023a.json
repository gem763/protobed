At the time, even Brexit hardliners were looking for reasons to support the deal. But the Attorney General spelt out in blunt terms that the UK had no legal way out of the hated backstop.\n\nReports of Mr Cox\u2019s threat come as Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom today insists in The Mail on Sunday there is \u2018cautious optimism\u2019 that a deal is within reach \u2013 despite Brussels refusing to hold talks with the UK this weekend.\n\nWriting opposite, Ms Leadsom says: \u2018If we do get a deal at the European Council on October 17 and 18, we will move at pace to get it through Parliament before October 31.\u2019\n\nBut last night, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte added to the sense of scepticism on the Continent, saying \u2018important questions remain\u2019 about Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals.\n\nSpeaking after a phone call with Mr Johnson, he said: \u2018There is a lot of work to be done ahead of October 17/18.\u2019 The European Commission said yesterday EU members had agreed that Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals \u2013 under which the backstop aimed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would be replaced by a system whereby Northern Ireland would stay in the EU single market for goods but leave the customs union \u2013 \u2018do not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\u2019. It added that the UK would be given \u2018another opportunity to present its proposals in detail\u2019 tomorrow.\n\nMr Cox (left) is understood to have conveyed the threat during a \u2018heated\u2019 exchange with the Prime Minister (right) over the Government\u2019s concession to a Scottish court last week that Mr Johnson would comply with the Commons\u2019 order to ask for a delay if no deal is agreed by October 19\n\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson will \u2018continue to hit the phones\u2019 over the coming days and \u2018remains open to meetings with EU leaders\u2019. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will travel to the Netherlands for talks later today. Mr Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator David Frost is expected to return to Brussels tomorrow and his chief of staff, Sir Edward Lister, will travel to Dublin to try to persuade the Irish Government to drop their opposition.\n\nNo 10 regards October 16 \u2013 the day before the start of the crunch EU summit \u2013 as the final deadline for the EU to lift its opposition, giving Mr Johnson just nine days to find common ground with Brussels.\n\nBut after Mr Cox\u2019s stand, Mr Johnson has spent this weekend holed up with advisers trying to thrash out which loophole could be used to obey the law while still sticking to his pledge that the UK will leave on October 31.\n\nGovernment lawyers are trying to find a form of words for the letter which would comply with the Act, yet not persuade the EU to grant a delay. Aides are also still looking at ways of trying to \u2018sabotage\u2019 the EU from within, such as by refusing to appoint a British EU commissioner, to force them to kick us out.\n\nDuring his encounter with Mr Johnson, Mr Cox is understood to have said the legal system would be destabilised if he did not comply with the so-called Benn Act, designed to force him to request an extension if no deal is done.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings told advisers the extension letter was \u2018Parliament\u2019s letter, not the Prime Minister\u2019s letter\u2019 \u2013 suggesting there were way of complying with the Benn Act but delivering Brexit on time.\n\nBut a source told this newspaper that the Attorney General \u2018thinks they can\u2019t get round the Act\u2019.\n\nMr Cox said last night that there was no \u2018row\u2019 when he met the Prime Minister. But asked if he had threatened to resign, he replied that he was \u2018not at liberty\u2019 to discuss any advice that he provided to the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Mail On Sunday COMMENT NOW is the moment of truth in the United Kingdom\u2019s long struggle to extricate itself from the European Union. For years many British people have suspected that the EU is not really interested in anything except more Europe. It is almost impossible to negotiate departure from a body which has no real understanding that a member nation might wish to regain its independence, or any real belief that a such a nation should have that right. Boris Johnson has put forward plans for a compromise which are sensible and thoughtful. He has taken account of the real worries of the Irish government and people about the revival of a new hard border with Northern Ireland. These plans have growing support from all sides at Westminster, and are a realistic basis for a lasting compromise. We shall now see what the EU\u2019s superficially emollient and smiling leaders are really made of, when the chance of a civilised, negotiated parting is placed before them.\n\nJunker raises hope of breakthrough\n\nBy Harry Cole\n\nChances of a Brexit breakthrough this month are low, but a glimmer of hope for Boris Johnson has emerged from Jean- Claude Juncker\u2019s inner circle.\n\nThe outgoing European Commission President has told his closest aides that cutting an 11th-hour deal with Britain would cement his reputation as the \u2018ultimate political fixer\u2019.\n\nJean- Claude Juncker has told his closest aides that cutting an 11th-hour deal with Britain would cement his reputation as the \u2018ultimate political fixer\n\nMr Juncker is due to step down on October 31, the day Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, meaning any delay \u2013 or a No Deal Brexit \u2013 would blight his legacy. EU sources say the outspoken Eurocrat made the remarks at a meeting of his most senior advisers last week.\n\nHowever, they came before the EU widely panned Boris Johnson\u2019s compromise offer, with hopes fading in London of a deal being cut before a possible General Election.\n\nA source close to Guy Verhofstadt, the head of the EU\u2019s Brexit Steering Group, said flatly last night: \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal does not have a chance. He seems to be gunning for no deal. Nothing is moving at all this weekend\u2019.\n\nA No10 source added: \u2018Even if Juncker wanted to do a deal, it is slipping out of his control. Appointing Michel Barnier, France\u2019s most unreasonable Frenchman, to lead the negotiations is coming home to roost.\u2019\n\nAnd yesterday, Britain\u2019s former EU Commissioner Lord Hill said that the major roadblock to a deal was Dublin and compromise before the end of the month was a \u2018stretch\u2019. The Brussels expert told the BBC: \u2018I spoke to an EU ambassador who said: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what the backstop is, we don\u2019t care about the backstop, we would be perfectly happy for the Irish to drop it, but so long as they want it, we\u2019re with the Irish,\u201d and that\u2019s the conundrum.\u2019\n\nOn Friday, No10 enforcer Dominic Cummings warned colleagues that if Europe shows no signs of compromise next week, then \u2018that\u2019s it, we\u2019re off\u2019.\n\nAnger as No10 halts US trade talks\n\nBy Glen Owen\n\nDowning Street has ordered Britain\u2019s trade negotiators to call a halt to talks with America over a post-EU deal \u2013 over fears that it might \u2018spook\u2019 Brussels and ruin the chance of a breakthrough in the Brexit impasse.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss says that the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia are all ready to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK post-Brexit\n\nOfficials at the Department for International Trade (DiT) have privately expressed their frustration that No 10 is not allowing them to close a deal with Washington in case it angers the EU in the run-up to the critical summit on October 17.\n\nThe DiT has hit back by arguing that securing deals with the US and other countries would help the talks by giving them \u2018leverage\u2019 for \u2018the purposes of EU negotiations\u2019.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss says that the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia are all ready to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK post-Brexit, describing them as \u2018very enthusiastic trading partners\u2019 who are \u2018very keen to get started\u2019. In America\u2019s case, it would be the largest free trade agreement the US has ever signed with another nation. Washington\u2019s major priority is to cut UK tariffs on steel imports, while Ms Truss is determined to secure access to the US\u2019s market for financial services.\n\nMs Truss said at last week\u2019s Tory conference: \u2018There are negotiations to go through first, but we are going to be tough negotiators. This is because we are in a very strong position, we\u2019re striking our first trade deals in 45 years, we\u2019re the fifth largest economy in the world. We have a lot of opportunities that those other nations want to access, though it\u2019s got to be in our interest to strike a deal.\u2019\n\nMs Truss travelled to New York last month to meet her opposite number, US trade boss Robert Lighthizer \u2013 and to insist the UK will not compromise on food standards or access to the NHS as part of the deal. London and Washington have provisionally agreed to aim for a deal to be struck by July 2020 \u2013 assuming Brexit has finally been secured before then.\n\nBack Boris's deal or Brexit will be the boxset that never ends\n\nBy Andrea Leadsom Business Secretary\n\nAfter spending more than two turbulent years as Leader of the House of Commons, I have developed a pretty good sense of the mood of the House.\n\nAnd the mood this week shifted to a tone of cautious optimism.\n\nThe reason for this seems clear to me.\n\nI hope Parliament can recognise that we are on the cusp of a breakthrough \u2013 and their backing makes all the difference, writes ANDREA LEADSOM\n\nAfter weeks of careful discussion, negotiation and compromise, the Prime Minister has provided a fair and reasonable offer to the EU. He has delivered on his promise to give them a proposal that addresses the problem of the backstop, but that protects the interests of the entire UK. The new deal will allow the United Kingdom to leave the EU on good and friendly terms. It meets the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 of taking back control of our money, laws and borders. It allows us to leave the customs union and the single market.\n\nAnd crucially, it protects the Irish peace process. Having recently met with some superb businesses in Belfast, to discuss Brexit readiness, I know how important it is for them to avoid friction at the border.\n\nThe offer is a compromise. It respects the integrity of the entire UK, but also of the EU\u2019s single market. Vitally, it requires democratic consent for the special arrangements in Northern Ireland and ensures flexibility for all parties to deal with the land border between the UK and the EU.\n\nWe have always been clear that we would prefer to leave the EU with a deal, with minimum disruption and with a good UK-EU relationship. This new deal offers that, while respecting the result of the referendum.\n\nThe proposal is our opportunity to strike a deal with the EU before we leave on October 31. We will now work with Brussels in the time remaining to iron out the details. We hope they come to the table in the same spirit we have \u2013 with optimism, compromise and mutual respect.\n\nIf we do get a deal at the European Council on the 17th and 18th of October, we will move at pace to get it through Parliament before October 31.\n\nIf the EU do not want to work with us, we will have to leave anyway, without a deal. But to be clear, the worst-case scenario isn\u2019t leaving the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is postponing yet again, and prolonging the uncertainty, with our hands tied by Parliament. Expensive for businesses and totally frustrating for those who just want us to get on with it.\n\nDelay is what Jeremy Corbyn wants. Having voted against a deal under the last Government, he then insisted he was so in favour of a deal that he was willing to delay leaving the EU.\n\nHe hampered our negotiating efforts in doing so, yet still we found a reasonable proposal \u2013 which he now refuses to accept. In fact, Corbyn rejected the deal so quickly \u2013 before the EU or Ireland had even had time to respond \u2013 that you might ask, with good reason, whether he\u2019s actually read it!\n\nThis Government will get Brexit done so Parliament can focus on our bold domestic agenda and deliver on the people\u2019s priorities.\n\nI remain optimistic. I have spoken to many people on all sides of the House who welcomed the Prime Minister\u2019s statement and his offer to meet with colleagues and discuss the proposal.\n\nBoris Johnson has proved his detractors wrong. They chose not to take him at his word when he said he would work hard to find a deal. Now we have a proposal that the EU must engage with, he needs the backing of all MPs for the sake of the country.\n\nI hope Parliament can recognise that we are on the cusp of a breakthrough \u2013 and their backing makes all the difference.\n\nThe public want to move on.\n\nBusinesses want to move on.\n\nParliament must move on.\n\nThere are many MPs who share the public\u2019s frustration \u2013 that Brexit is like the boxset that never ends.\n\nThey agree that it\u2019s time for the big finale, so we can move on to the next great series. And an increasing number agree that this is the sensible and workable proposal that will do just that.\n\nLet\u2019s get on with it!", "description": "Mr Cox is understood to have conveyed the threat during a 'heated' exchange with Mr Johnson over the Government's concession that the PM would ask for a delay if no deal is agreed by October 19.", "authors": ["Brendan Carlin And Glen Owen For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19342638-0-image-a-6_1570307882852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
