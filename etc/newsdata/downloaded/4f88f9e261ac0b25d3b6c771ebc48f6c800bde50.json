She went to a dermatologist who told her the bump was likely nothing to worry about, as the skin around it appeared healthy. But the doctor recommended Strupp see a gynecologist anyway, and she did. In August 2018, the bump was removed and sent for testing.\n\nGIRL, 7, WITH TERMINAL BRAIN TUMOR COMPLETING BUCKET LIST AFTER STRANGERS DONATE THOUSANDS\n\nSoon after, Strupp received news that would change her life. What she thought was an ingrown hair was actually stage 2 vulvar melanoma, a rare type of cancer that accounts for \u201cno more than two percent of melanomas among women,\u201d according to Cancer Network, which is a part of the medical journal Oncology.\n\n\u201cI thought it was just a little ingrown hair and since they didn\u2019t give me anything to worry about, I took my time to get it removed,\u201d Strupp said, according to Metro. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried at the time and was very busy with work. It took me time to see my gynecologist to take care of it.\u201d\n\nBut when she received the diagnosis, \u201cI was horrified, scared and paralyzed with fear. Never in my life did I hear about vulvar melanoma.\u201d\n\nStrupp required surgery to remove the cancer, which had spread to surrounding lymph nodes \u2014 meaning it had been upgraded to stage 3 vulvar melanoma, per Metro. Following surgery, doctors recommended she undergo 12 immunotherapy treatments throughout the course of a year.\n\nAccording to Metro, she suffered side effects such as rashes, migraines and extreme fatigue.\n\nSince beginning treatment, Strupp has taken to Instagram to share updates. In a July 17 post, Strupp announced her scans were clear but noted she had two treatments left. In a Sept. 10 post, she said she completed her immunotherapy treatments.\n\nStrupp said connecting with others battling cancer through social media has helped her find and build a community of support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to and spoken to people all around the world \u2014 Germany, Argentina, [and] England \u2014 and in the US. Not everyone has my specific melanoma \u2026 or some are starting their immunotherapy and want to know what it\u2019s like,\u201d she said. \u201cOr maybe they just want someone to connect with so they know when they explain their side effects, you can understand.\u201d\n\nStrupp is required to see a doctor every four to six months in order to ensure her cancer has not returned.\n\n\u201cCancer took so much away from me [but] I won\u2019t let it take me down and change me. I\u2019m not a cancer victim, I\u2019m defeating it,\u201d she said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAs for her message to others battling cancer: \u201cYou are not alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLean on your family, friends and loved ones. You will have stormy days, but the sun will shine the next day. It\u2019s OK to be scared and cry,\u201d she said. \u201cJust know there are others out there like you that are there to support, love and help you.\u201d", "description": "A Milwaukee, Wisc., woman was candid when detailing her battle with a rare cancer after noticing what she thought was a harmless ingrown hair on a personal part of her body.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
