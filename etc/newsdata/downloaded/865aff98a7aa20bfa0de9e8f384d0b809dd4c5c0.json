You cannot fight fire with fire. We do not want deaths. We do not want war.\u201d\n\nMr L\u00f3pez Obrador campaigned for the presidency on a platform of ending corruption and cracking down on Mexico\u2019s cartels.\n\nAccording to official reports, the government detained Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez on Thursday afternoon at a home in Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Sinaloa State. In response, members of the Sinaloa cartel mobilised, attacking the Mexican National Guard.\n\nVideos shared on social media showing cartel members riding in truck beds outfitted with machine guns and firing in the streets in broad daylight.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutgunned, the Mexican security forces released Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, but fighting between the cartel and the National Guard continued into the night. Roads were blocked and cars set aflame, according to witnesses.\n\nThe violence left at least eight dead and 21 injured. Some reports indicated that Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez might have been traded for the release of Mexican soldiers captured in the firefight.\n\nA lawyer for Guzm\u00e1n family confirmed to the Associated Press that Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was \u201calive and free\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the Sinaloa cartel has lost some of its influence since El Chapo was arrested and convicted in US court of money laundering and murder, the cartel remains powerful in Culiac\u00e1n. Analysts who spoke to the New York Times said the violence in Culiac\u00e1n could be an indicator that the cartel is splintering as different factions jockey for control now that El Chapo is no longer in control.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, has helped run the Sinaloa cartel along with his brothers since his father\u2019s 2016 arrest, is also wanted in the US on charges of drug trafficking.\n\nRead more\n\nWho is the Mexican drug baron and Sinaloa cartel kingpin El Chapo?", "description": "*/After a deadly firefight between Mexican security forces and members of the Sinaloa cartel, the country's president cancelled the arrest warrant for the son of drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and ending the police operation which was about to take him into custody.", "authors": ["Vittoria Elliott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dx0lnGze7kDkUbsJV.kxpw--~B/aD0zNjU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/53c84f08d2c0c664b59a0182fd79bb1f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
