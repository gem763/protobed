For the 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d film, Jack Nicholson lowered the nemesis\u2019 register, making him more menacing but still cartoonish.\n\nBoth voices informed Hamill\u2019s portrayal in the bleaker \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d in the early \u201990s. Hamill initially voiced other roles on the series; soon the producers asked him to take a crack at replacing Tim Curry, who wasn\u2019t quite right for this Joker.\n\nWhen Hamill received the audition script, his copy read: \u201cDon\u2019t think Nicholson.\u201d So he reached back to his Broadway experience as Mozart in \u201cAmadeus\u201d \u2014 the composer was said to have stunned the imperial court in Vienna with his donkey\u2019s bray of a laugh. Hamill tossed in notes from the Blue Meanies in the Beatles\u2019 film \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d and the 1930s \u201cDracula\u201d actor Dwight Frye, among other things, and won the role.\n\n\u201cI looked at this drawing, and he seemed to be all teeth, all teeth, all TEETH,\u201d Hamill said by phone from his Los Angeles home, drawing out the Blue Meanie creepiness of the line. \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be a \u2018Joker laugh\u2019 \u2014 I want there to be a palette of colors, sinister, intimidating, gleeful, insane, every emotion that you can think of. It\u2019s a large part of how he communicates.\u201d\n\nBesides that series, which ran from 1992 to 1995, Hamill has played the Joker in multiple spinoffs on television and in video games. With his arsenal of laughs \u2014 on the phone, he delightfully offered a low, chuckling \u201chmm-hmm-hmm-hmm,\u201d a softly whooping \u201choo hoo\u201d and what he called a \u201cbig, broad ah-hah-HA-HA-HA-HAH!\u201d \u2014 Hamill set the standard for the character\u2019s vocal depth and richness.", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s predecessors on TV and video say that cackle takes strenuous effort.
