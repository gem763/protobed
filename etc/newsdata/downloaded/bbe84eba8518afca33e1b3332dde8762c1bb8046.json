Liz Cheney of Wyoming was not as measured as McConnell\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing U.S. forces from northern Syria is a catastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens America\u2019s national security,\u201d the House Republican Conference chairwoman said in a statement, referencing the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. \u201cPulling out of northern Syria ignores that painful lesson, represents an abandonment of our Kurdish allies despite their vital contributions to the fight against ISIS, emboldens Iran and serves as an undeserved gift to the Ergodan regime, which has only continued its steady march toward Moscow.\u201d\n\nTURKEY ANNOUNCES INCURSION OF NORTHEAST SYRIA, US-BACKED KURDS HAVE VOWED 'ALL-OUT' WAR\n\nTrump vociferously defended his decision in a long series of tweets on Monday, saying the ISIS \u201cCaliphate\u201d has been defeated and lamenting that the U.S. was in the region years longer than planned. Reprising the rhetoric on foreign wars he has often used on the campaign trail, he described the fight as a regional conflict for Turkey and other countries to wage -- not America's problem.\n\n\u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTrump added in another tweet that if Erdogan's government did anything that \u201cI, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits,\u201d the U.S. would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s reassurances aside, the White House\u2019s move to withdraw troops and effectively green-light the Turkish invasion has been opposed even by some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies in Congress.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Monday morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it an \u201cimpulsive decision\u201d by Trump that would undo U.S. gains in the region and give ISIS fighters a \u201csecond lease on life.\u201d\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has had a mixed relationship with the president ever since the 2016 election, went on a tweetstorm himself on Monday in which he lambasted the decision and said it would be \u201cdisgraceful\u201d to abandon the Kurds.\n\n\u201cIt would also be DISGRACEFUL if we sat idly by while Turkey slaughters the Kurds, as public reports suggest that Turkish leader Erdogan explicitly told President Trump he intends to do. Kurds risked their lives\u2014for many years\u2014to fight alongside us,\u201d Cruz tweeted.\n\nHours after the White House announcement, Kurdish-led forces in Syria reported that American troops had started withdrawing from areas along Turkey's border. A video posted by a Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of U.S. armored vehicles apparently heading away from the border area of Tal Abyad.\n\nThe decision to give Ankara the green light was seen by the Kurdish fighters as a major shift in U.S. policy. Over 11,000 mostly Kurdish fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been killed fighting ISIS in Syria.\n\nAlong with congressional Republicans, the withdrawal of U.S. troops has been staunchly criticized by current and former government and military officials, with former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley calling it \u201ca big mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,\u201d Haley tweeted. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nOne U.S. commander who helped lead the anti-ISIS effort told Fox News the decision amounted to a propaganda victory for China and Russia, saying those countries could tell would-be U.S. partners that America will abandon them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNo one will ever partner with us again,\u201d the commander said.\n\nAs for Turkey's intentions with the Kurds, the senior military officer said: \u201cThey are going to slaughter those cats.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump vigorously defended on Monday his decision to withdraw\u00a0United States troops from northern Syria ahead of a planned invasion of the region by Turkey, even as his Republican allies in both the Senate and House vehemently criticized the move.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/07/694940094001_6092968412001_6092961424001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
