Sign up here.\n\nA Honduran woman says an ICE officer raped her for seven years, sometimes as often as four times a week, and threatened to deport her if she told anyone what was happening. Over the course of the alleged abuse, she says she also got pregnant three times.\n\nThe officer, who has not been employed by ICE for \u201cseveral years,\u201d according to a spokesperson, recruited the woman as an informant after discovering she was undocumented. Now, the woman has sued ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the former ICE officer, Wilfredo Rodriguez, and wants $10 million in damages. The suit also alleges the agency\u2019s culture allowed the abuse to happen and that ICE agents are allowed to \u201cintimidate and abuse undocumented individuals.\u201d\n\nAfter arresting her brother in 2006, Rodriguez discovered the woman had an outstanding deportation order and said he would help her if she agreed to act as an informant. She tipped him off to three Honduran men who had previously stabbed her husband, and in January 2007, he called the woman and told her to meet him at a motel off the highway.\n\nHe said he wanted to show her a picture of someone he needed her to find, according to the lawsuit. Instead, she says, he raped her and threatened her with his gun if she said anything.\n\nFrom that point on, Rodriguez raped the woman several times a week, according to the lawsuit. He allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and would \u201cforce [her] to endure and participate in abhorrent sexual behavior,\u201d all while threatening to deport her or hurt her family if she said anything.\n\nThe woman says the alleged abuse continued for seven years and that she got pregnant three times as a result of being raped by Rodriguez: in 2008, 2009, and 2013. She terminated each pregnancy.\n\nSometime between 2009 and 2010, Rodriguez\u2019s superiors became suspicious of his treatment of informants, according to the lawsuit. At one point, the woman was called in to the ICE office in Connecticut, where she says another agent told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to have any contact with officers outside the office or outside of regular business hours. Despite that, Rodriguez kept contacting her, according to the suit.\n\nIn 2014, Rodriguez called her while she was at work, which she says made her so stressed that she fell off a ladder and hurt her neck, back, ribs, and shoulders. She had to get surgery and used her recovery as an excuse not to see him.\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t tell anyone what happened to her until 2018, when her father fled Honduras and applied for asylum, claiming his daughter\u2019s work as an informant had put his life in danger there. When ICE agents asked her about her work with Rodriguez, she told them everything, according to the suit.\n\nCover image: (romkaz/iStock / Getty Images Plus)", "description": "She terminated each pregnancy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db0861362af2e008dc84591/lede/1571850862904-GettyImages-140471382.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.843956043956044xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
