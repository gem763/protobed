(Sara Faraj/MLive.com/The Flint Journal via AP)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the United Auto Workers union's strike that has crippled U.S. production at General Motors (all times local):\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nA United Auto Workers official says about seven to nine union picketers were arrested for blocking a roadway at a General Motors plant in Tennessee.\n\nLocal UAW Chairman Mike Herron said the arrests came Wednesday at the Spring Hill plant after authorities asked the protesters multiple times to get out of the road. Herron said he believes the protesters were afraid trucks might get into the plant.\n\nHerron said at a news conference that police and the sheriff's department have done a fantastic job and have been supportive during the ongoing strike.\n\nHe said arrests take the union off its message.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nThe strike by 49,000 United Auto Workers against General Motors is starting to affect production in other countries.\n\nCompany spokesman Dan Flores confirms that the 3-day-old strike has forced GM to place about 1,200 workers on temporary layoff at a Canadian factory that makes pickup trucks.\n\nThe plant in Oshawa, Ontario, near Toronto makes the previous generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups.\n\nThe Silverado is GM's top-selling vehicle in the U.S.\n\nThe plant also makes the Chevrolet Impala large car, and that production has not been affected.\n\nFlores says production continues at two other Canadian plants which make engines and the Chevrolet Equinox SUV.\n\nHe says parts shortages due to the strike have not affected production in Mexico.\n\n____\n\n12:40 p.m.\n\nUnion and company bargainers rested Tuesday night but returned to work Wednesday morning as a strike by United Auto Workers that brought 33 General Motors factories to a halt continued into its third day.\n\nProgress was reported as committees continued work on thorny issues such as wages, health insurance costs, use of temporary workers, and new work for plants slated to close.\n\nUAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the talks were moving slowly but progressing.\n\nMore than 49,000 workers walked off their jobs on Monday in a dispute over the union's quest to get a bigger share of GM's profits and the company's goal of cutting labor costs so they're closer to those at U.S. auto plants run by foreign companies.\n\nHealth care costs and giving temporary workers a clear path to permanent jobs were two major sticking points in talks toward a new four-year contract.\n\n____\n\n8 a.m.\n\nUnion and company bargainers are making progress toward a new contract as a strike by United Auto Workers brought 33 General Motors factories to a halt continued into its third day.\n\nCommittees working on thorny issues such as wages, health insurance costs, use of temporary workers, and new work for plants slated to close worked until early evening Tuesday and are scheduled to resume bargaining early Wednesday.\n\nUAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the talks were moving slowly but progressing.\n\nMore than 49,000 workers walked off their jobs on Monday in a dispute over the union's quest to get a bigger share of GM's profits and the company's goal of cutting labor costs so they're closer to those at U.S. auto plants run by foreign companies.\n\nHealth care costs and giving temporary workers a clear path to permanent jobs were two major sticking points in talks toward a new four-year contract.\n\n____", "description": "A United Auto Workers official says about seven to nine union picketers were arrested for blocking a roadway at a General Motors plant in Tennessee.
