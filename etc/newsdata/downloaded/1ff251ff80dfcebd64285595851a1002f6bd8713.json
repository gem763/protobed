As much as 85 per cent of the fund's portfolio by value sits in the key land-constrained and high-performing eastern seaboard markets of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\n\nIts existing land holdings have the capacity to develop over 650,000sq m of new core logistics facilities with an anticipated value on completion of $1.2 billion.\n\n\"Record infrastructure spending on road and rail, combined with rising e-commerce and companies seeking supply chain efficiencies through new highly automated facilities, is driving the demand for logistics premises, particularly in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane,\" Mr Mason said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"At the same time, supply of modern logistics facilities is low, pushing vacancy rates lower and rents higher.\"\n\nRecent acquisitions include retailer Metcash's regional distribution centre in Brisbane's Crestmead, the Coca-Cola production facility in Perth's Kewdale and Bombardier\u2019s Australian headquarters in Dandenong South, Melbourne.\n\nDeveloper and fund manager Charter Hall last year booked a bumper 25.5 per cent lift in operating earnings. The increase in the full-year operating result, to $220.7 million, betters the guidance issued most recently at the start of July of a 24 per cent increase and follows several earlier upgrades in profit expectations through the year.\n\nCPIF has been actively tweaking its portfolio. Last month it sold three assets, out of a pool of five it was offering, in South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory to the newly listed Investec Australia Property Fund for $81 million.", "description": "Local investors are underweight in logistics relative to their overseas counterparts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/89bc7fa41530035a2cc340b75bd20e4b4a68abd1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
