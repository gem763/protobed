He sealed the win against Humbert after 2 hours, 22 minutes with an easy volley winner at the net.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road to get back to this point,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t expect it to come so soon since I started playing again. It\u2019s been a big surprise to me and I\u2019m happy to be through to the final.\u201d\n\nWawrinka had an easier time once he recovered from a 2-0 deficit in the first set, needing just 65 minutes to beat Sinner.\n\nThe 34-year-old Wawrinka is looking for his first ATP title since the 2017 Geneva Open.\n\n\u201cStan\u2019s a brilliant player. We\u2019ve played against each other in some big matches in the past in big tournaments,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt was actually my match with him at the French Open in 2017 when my hip problems really started. It was a tough five-set match in the semis and my hip never really recovered from that, so it\u2019s cool to be back playing against him in a final.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andy Murray is back in an ATP tour final for the first time since March 2017 after beating Ugo Humbert 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the European Open semifinals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
