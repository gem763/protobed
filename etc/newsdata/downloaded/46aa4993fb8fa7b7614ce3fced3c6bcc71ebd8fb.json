Don't be rude and assume others are stupid. Change your approach otherwise people won't take you seriously!'\n\nA second argued: 'Lucy the vegan did not come across very well during that debate. I'm all for standing up in what you believe in but there's a right way to do it instead of shouting and being rude.'\n\nThe latest Tesco television ad campaign features Carl, a white working class single dad and Chloe discussing eating animals\n\nSpeaking about the advert, Lucy had insisted that the ad made her feel 'warm and fuzzy' and quizzed farmer Abi on whether it had any false information\n\nAbi wasn't a fan of the advert and felt it used language that 'demonized' meat consumption\n\nA third fumed: 'You have a serious attitude problem there was absolutely no need for your rudeness to holly and Phil and Abi you would get a lot more supporters if you came across more likable just a thought.\n\nHowever some users did agree with Lucy, and felt that she shouldn't be given a 'hard time' for promoting what she believes in and another telling viewers to 'educate themselves' by reading up on veganism online.\n\nOne said: 'Go Lucy #ThisMorning if they put an advert on the way they kill animals, maybe that's will change there minds.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Lucy Watson getting a hard time for showing compassion for farm animals, shows us how unfeeling & disconnected we are as a species. 'Oh but I love my dog' says the meat eater.'\n\nA third added: 'Supporting Lucy all the way! That farmer was chatting crap! Definitely not 98% of houses sating meat!\n\n'How stupid can people be! Read online and educate yourself!!'\n\nHowever some viewers agreed with the reality star with one insisting they were 'supporting her all the way'\n\nOne user claimed that the reality star was 'misinformed' about her facts while another branded her 'rude and condescending'.\n\nThe user said: 'Wow Lucy, you are misinformed about farming for someone who says they grew up on a farm... there are nearly 140000 farmers in the UK and c.800 'factory farms'. Please, get your facts right.\n\nAnother said: 'If being vegan makes you as rude and condescending as she was, then I'm having a steak! (I know a lot of vegetarians and vegans who aren't btw) '\n\nOne user claimed that the reality star was 'misinformed' about her facts while another branded her 'rude and condescending'\n\nA third argued: 'Lucy Watson is a very angry little woman whose family's fortune is based on restaurants serving meat. Vegans like her appear to be so militant and self righteous, sadly that attitude won't encourage many to subscribe to veganism.'", "description": "Lucy Watson, 28, was criticised by This Morning viewers after fans thought she was 'rude' to hosts\u00a0Holly Willoughby and\u00a0Phillip Schofield during a debate on Tesco's new vegan advert.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19783538-0-image-a-41_1571222909477.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
