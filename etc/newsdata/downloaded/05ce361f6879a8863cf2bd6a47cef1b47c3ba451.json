Attention from political leaders is not lost on Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of top pharmaceutical company Merck (MRK), who said on Thursday that the pharmaceutical industry \u201cis right in the crosshairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery person running for president has a plan to reduce pharmaceutical pricing,\u201d he adds, speaking to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer at the All Markets Summit. \u201cSome of them I think are legitimate plans, some of them will hurt innovation, which we don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nFrazier referred to a Gallup poll that found the pharmaceutical industry is the least popular sector. He did not specify which poll but was likely alluding to a survey released by Gallup last month, which found that 27% of Americans felt positively about the pharmaceutical industry and 58% felt negatively about it, a net 31-point negative rating that ranked it last among all industries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re below Congress, below bankers, below tobacco,\u201d Frazier says. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good place to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a good thing for an industry that exists to save people\u2019s lives,\u201d he adds.\n\nIncreased competition in the sector has also put companies under pressure, Frazier said.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 26: Kenneth C. Frazier (C), chairman and CEO of Merck & Co. Inc., testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on \"Drug Pricing in America: A Prescription for Change, Part II\" February 26, 2019 in Washington, DC. The committee heard testimony from a panel of pharmaceutical company CEOs on the reasons for rising costs of prescription drugs.

A significant portion of the company\u2019s recent success has stemmed from sales of Keytruda, a cancer drug.\n\nFrazier has worked at the firm for more than two decades, and became its chief executive in 2011. The company has reportedly begun to ready itself for his departure, launching a search for a successor that has focused on internal candidates.\n\nRepublican and Democratic leaders, including Trump and Pelosi, have criticized pharmaceutical companies like Merck for what they consider to be excessively high drug prices. In recent weeks, despite the launch of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, aides to Trump and Pelosi have continued to discuss a bipartisan bill that would limit the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nIn 2016, Frazier told the Senate Finance Committee that companies cannot \u201cunilaterally lower list prices without running into financial and operating disadvantages.\u201d\n\nFrazier entered a national political firestorm in August 2017, when he stepped down from a business advisory council for President Donald Trump, following remarks from Trump that appeared to draw equivalence between white supremacists and counter-protesters at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In response, Trump immediately criticized Frazier, saying the resignation would afford him \"more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the incident a few months later, Frazier told The New York Times, \u201cI think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\u201d\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\nRead more:\n\nPresident Trump's way of communicating is 'hurting civility': Ariel Investments Co-CEO Mellody Hobson\n\nFormer Cisco CEO John Chambers: 'The extremes are controlling a lot of politics'\n\nThe Property Brothers say these are two of the best cities for real estate investment\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "\u201cEvery person running for president has a plan to reduce pharmaceutical pricing,\u201d Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier says. \u201cSome of them I think are legitimate plans, some of them will hurt innovation, which we don\u2019t want.\u201d", "authors": ["Max Zahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zeppnMXBp9UzTYXEG0j69g--~B/aD0xMTI1O3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/52e37900-eacf-11e9-bffd-6f741fe2b209", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
