He has the power. He always hits 20, 30 homers every single year. So, I don\u2019t expect anything less. He\u2019s definitely been huge for us all year long.\u201d\n\nThe Brewers pulled even with the Chicago Cubs for the NL\u2019s second wild card and both trailed first-place St. Louis by two games in the NL Central.\n\nManager Craig Counsell likes how everybody is contributing during this late-season charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel like if we post a good record, a good game every day for these last 11-12, we\u2019ll find ourselves in a pretty good spot.\u201d\n\nMoustakas teed off on a 1-2 pitch from reliever Matt Strahm (5-9) in the bottom of the seventh after Hunter Renfroe\u2019s 32nd home run in the top of the inning tied the score at 1-1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment because we kind of lose the momentum a little bit with the game tied and everybody pitching so well,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cBut, he took it right back, I thought, and it\u2019s a huge spot.\u201d\n\nRenfroe, who had missed nine games with a sprained left ankle, connected off Matt Albers (8-5) and spoiled the six scoreless innings crafted by three Milwaukee pitchers.\n\nBrandon Woodruff started, struck out four and walked one in the first two innings. Gio Gonzalez allowed two hits and struck out four over the third, fourth and fifth. Brent Suter retired the side in order in the sixth, striking out two.\n\nDrew Pomeranz struck out the side in the eighth and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his second save in as many chances.\n\nBen Gamel scored on Trent Grisham\u2019s sacrifice fly in the eighth.\n\nPadres rookie right-hander Chris Paddack made his 26th start of the season and first against the Brewers. He allowed one hit, Cain\u2019s solo shot in the third, walked one and struck out nine in five innings.\n\nPaddack knew he made a mistake on the pitch to Cain.\n\n\u201cOne pitch I\u2019d take back was the Cain at-bat,\u201d Paddack said. \u201cI just kind of got away from myself. We were trying to stay stubborn, and I just made a mistake. I left that fastball right over the middle. He already saw six before that and it\u2019s hard to blow 94 (mph) by a veteran hitter like that.\u201d\n\nThe Padres matched a season-high with their sixth straight loss.\n\nManny Machado had an infield single and Paddack added a base hit.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPadres: LF Wil Myers was scratched and replaced by Nick Martini in left. No reason was given for the change, but Myers struck out pinch-hitting in the eighth. \u2026 C Francisco Mejia (right oblique strain) was reinstated from the 10-day injured list. He was available to pinch hit or catch.\n\nBrewers: Woodruff was reinstated from the 10-day injured list (left oblique strain) prior to the game. \u2026 C Manny Pi\u00f1a (mild concussion) was cleared to play by the doctors from MLB. He\u2019s been out since taking a foul tip off his mask Sept. 5th. \u2026 2B Keston Hiura (strained left hamstring) was back in the starting lineup. He had only pinch hit twice since being reinstated from the 10-day injured list Sept. 11th.\n\nMYERS UPDATE\n\nManager Andy Green said that Myers was scratched from the starting lineup because of an arm issue.\n\n\u201cHe was fine to hit, but his arm was hanging a little bit,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe\u2019s played through it the last three or four days and it was bothering him a quite a bit today. He thought he was gonna be able to go, but he wasn\u2019t really able to throw the baseball. So, we used him as a pinch-hitter today. Hopefully, he\u2019s back in there tomorrow.\u201d\n\nPOMERANZ FOR TWO\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to go back out there a second inning,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave it all I had the first inning (the 8th) and came back in. He (Counsell) said, \u2018Keep going.\u2019 My focus is getting outs. So, it was three more outs.\u201d\n\nSTAT FACTS\n\nIt was Renfroe\u2019s first home run since August 10 against Colorado and his first on the road since Aug. 1st at the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nPaddack allowed his first earned run since Aug. 29th, a solo home run by the San Francisco Giants Brandon Belt.\n\nThe Padres are 13-19 against the NL Central and 18-52 when scoring three or fewer runs.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-5, 4.06) makes his second career start against the Brewers. He\u2019s allowed no more than three earned runs in 10 of his 12 previous starts this season.\n\nBrewers: RHP Adrian Houser (6-6, 3.84 ERA) makes his second appearance and first start against the Padres this season. He tossed 3 1/3 scoreless innings in relief on June 19th at Petco Park.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Moustakas used one swing of the bat to give the Milwaukee Brewers' playoff push a big boost.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Totoraitis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/padres_brewers_baseball_83707_c0-148-1706-1142_s1770x1032.jpg?3bb4430d1ff0c71fe7aa679e772b3c766b2c16f4", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
