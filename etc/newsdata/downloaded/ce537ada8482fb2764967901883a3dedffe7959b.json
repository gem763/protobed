Given the time he missed, the team can be thankful they didn\u2019t listen to some fans and media who wanted to trade outfielder Michael A. Taylor earlier this year.\n\nRobles was in the starting lineup Saturday at Nationals Park, but Washington knows it can count on Taylor for strong defense and baserunning if needed off the bench. That seemed like a stretch back in June when Taylor \u2014 who had appeared in more than 100 major league games in three of the previous four seasons \u2014 was sent to Double-A Harrisburg for a spell.\n\nNow he\u2019s one of five outfielders on the Nationals\u2019 World Series roster.\n\n\u201cIt is great to be a part of this,\u201d Taylor said before Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cIt is an honor. I love playing the game of baseball. It is something I will remember for a long time.\u201d\n\nNationals assistant general manager Doug Harris revealed that Taylor preferred to go to Double-A instead of Triple-A Fresno due to his background with the Harrisburg staff. Harris gave credit to Harrisburg manager Matt LeCroy, a former Nationals\u2019 coach, and Senators hitting coach Brian Rupp for getting Taylor on track.\n\n\u201cI think we have done a very good job of seeing people through,\u201d Harris told The Washington Times during prior to Game 4 Saturday.\n\nTaylor, who hit nine home runs in 57 games with Harrisburg, belted a homer in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
