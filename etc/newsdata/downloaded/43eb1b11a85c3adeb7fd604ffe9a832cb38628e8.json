This was no fifth-dimensional chess move; it was the commander in chief saying the quiet, treasonous part out loud.\n\nSet aside that accepting such help is illegal\u2014after all, the laws are for the little people in Trump\u2019s Great America\u2014it was Peak Trump.\n\nTalking about Large Adult Son Don Jr. testifying before the Senate again about his infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian emissary promising dirt on Hillary Clinton (\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say, I love it!\u201d), Trump replied:\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d take it.\u201d\n\nIn Trump speak, that was, \u201cPlease send Biden oppo to Donnie@StableGenius.com asap!!\u201d Rest assured, Don\u2019s not calling the FBI, so bring it on!\n\nMr. \u201cNo Collusion\u201d on Wednesday welcomed collusion with and aid from any and all hostile foreign powers to ensure his re-election in 2020. Trump invited all comers to fuck America, good and hard, if it means he gets the goods\u2014again, I may point out\u2014on his Democratic opponent.\n\nTrump proved Wednesday exactly what we\u2019ve known about him for quite some time\u2014he combines treachery, stupidity, and villainy in equal measure. After his disgusting performance in the Oval Office on Wednesday, I\u2019d call Trump a political whore for foreign powers, but that would give whores a bad name.\n\nThis is nothing new. Let\u2019s not forget, Trump requested this kind of help in 2016. It wasn\u2019t a joke. It wasn\u2019t \u201cTrump being Trump.\u201d It was Trump on live television soliciting Russian intelligence service help in defeating Hillary. He received that help through the GRU\u2019s subsidiary WikiLeaks within hours of his ask.\n\nAll Vladimir Putin has received in return is an American president who lets the Russian leader run wild, who sides with a former KGB officer over American intelligence services at every turn, and who displays utter obeisance to the Russian leader. Kak skazat\u2019, \u201cReturn on investment\u201d?\n\nWe live in a world of counterfactuals, hypotheticals, and more tu quoque scenarios than a reasonable person can process. That said, I have to beg my Republican friends to imagine\u2014just for a moment\u2014what you\u2019d be doing if Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama said they would accept the help of a foreign power in a campaign and not report it to the FBI.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what you\u2019d do: You\u2019d lose your fucking shit.\n\nYou\u2019d spurt blood from your goddamn eyes.\n\nYou\u2019d corner the market on guillotine, tumbrel, and pitchfork stocks. A gibbet would appear in Lafayette Park.\n\nFox News producers and on-air talent would grind out weeks of videos until they collapsed, as sick and exhausted as they keep saying Trump\u2019s opponents must be. They\u2019d work like galley slaves, a nearly naked Lou Dobbs beating a massive kettle drum to keep them producing screeching agitporn.\n\nEntire forests would be leveled and pulped to write the condemnatory articles and books. The lights would dim on the Eastern Seaboard, and nuclear power plants would be brought online to support the massive surge of electricity needed to power a hundred thousand new servers hosting the hundred million articles and videos you\u2019d make condemning this outrageous act.\n\nYou\u2019d demand not only impeachment, but also drawing, quartering, and the wholesale razing of the villages of everyone involved. You\u2019d call anyone else doing this a traitor, a villain, and the worst person ever to hold the office of president.\n\nBut we all know what\u2019s going to happen to Trump, don\u2019t we? It\u2019s already happening:\n\nNot a goddamned thing.\n\nA few Republicans in the Senate will\u2014ever so briefly\u2014furrow their brows. Some will issue anodyne comments that if you squint and look really closely could be vaguely suggestive of something in the general vicinity of an elliptical criticism of Trump\u2019s invitation to foreign governments to fuck us.\n\nIn the House, the Clown Caucus will run around with their dicks out, as per normal, and bleat about Jim Comey or Chris Steele or Bruce Ohr or Peter Strzok or whatever imaginary Deep State conspiracy they\u2019re trying to froth into existence today. They\u2019ll race to Fox shows like Bonfire of the Hannity to bellow about witch hunts and reap millions from the boob donors on their email lists: Help me fight the Deep State and protect President Trump from Soros-Clinton-Hussein Obama Witch Hunt Sharia Lesbianism.\n\nBill Barr\u2019s Trump Family Legal Defense and Obstruction Center will do exactly fuck-all. Nothing, exactly nothing will be said or done about this outrage. A real attorney general would demand a private meeting in the Oval Office and would give President Fuckwit both barrels. A real attorney general would nut-punch a president who so obviously invites foreign intelligence services to compromise the so-called leader of the free world. Bill Barr is not a real attorney general. He is a family retainer for Trump Inc., a small man in a big job without the moral compass or legal sensibility God gave the common rat.\n\nTrump also threw Christopher Wray under the bus Wednesday, spitting \u201cThe FBI director is wrong\u201d for saying a person should call the FBI if a foreign government offers them information intended to sway our elections. But Wray won\u2019t quit. Neither will Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats or CIA Director Gina Haspel. No one will.\n\nThey tell themselves a pretty lie that their replacements will be worse and that they\u2019re the last ones standing between Trump, compromise, and chaos.\n\nThey\u2019re wrong. Every one of them is now an enabler at best or a co-conspirator at worst. These are fearful, honorless men and women serving the most honorless man ever to besmirch the office of the president.\n\nWhat is even more mind-boggling is that Trump uttered this line of utterly treasonous bile while sitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump solicited foreign help while he sat behind the desk where Obama was briefed on the raid that would capture and kill Osama bin Laden. The desk where George W. Bush spoke to the nation in the hours after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C.\n\nIt was the desk where George Herbert Walker Bush helped end the Cold War without firing a shot and where Reagan plotted the end of Soviet communism.\n\nIt was where JFK faced down Castro and Khrushchev as they tried to install nuclear weapons 90 miles south of Miami.\n\nTrump\u2019s ichor, his slimy amorality, his reek of greed and treason is an insult to the work, legacy, and memory of the men of both political parties who put America before their own egos, their own political fortunes. The sense of anger, outrage, and disgust on the part of Americans with the slightest sense of conscience is palpable and justified. That is directed not only at Trump but all those who serve and enable him, and dare call that public service.\n\nTrump took an oath\u2014the most sacred oath in our nation. You know it: \u201cI do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump confirmed for the world that the oath of office is like every other oath he\u2019s ever sworn, every wedding vow and promise he\u2019s made, and every contract he\u2019s ever signed. Trump views it\u2014and us\u2014as purely contingent, solely about his personal (and now) political benefit.\n\nIt holds up only so long as he\u2019s getting laid or getting paid.", "description": "On Wednesday, Trump confirmed he treats his oath to serve the United States faithfully with the same contempt he\u2019s given to his wedding vows and business contracts.", "authors": ["Rick Wilson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1560396568/190612-wilson-trump-tease_xapu2n", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
