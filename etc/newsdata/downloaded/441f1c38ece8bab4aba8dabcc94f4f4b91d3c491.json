Finance ministers will be very glad if this is finally settled and off the agenda. The fact the OECD has published this consultation document is an indicator it may have a certain level of broad support among Inclusive Framework members.\n\nCertainty would be welcome\n\nThere is much to do but business needs certainty and would generally accept the risk of an increased global tax liability in return for that certainty. It does not want an overly complex solution, as some of the earlier recommendations in this process suggested. The goal is to find a solution where there are no big winners and big losers in any reallocation of taxing rights.\n\nSo what are the key features of the plan?\n\nThe OECD document calls for public input on the scope for the Unified Approach, including whether to limit it to those businesses that are subject to country-by-country tax reporting rules (broadly, $1 billion global group turnover). Importantly for Australia, extractive industries and certain financial services may fall outside the scope of the Unified Approach, although this will doubtless be the subject of international debate.\n\nThe Unified Approach\u2019s most dramatic feature is that some of the \u201cresidual profit\u201d of a multinational would be able to be taxed in market jurisdictions, even where the multinational had no taxable presence there under current rules. This would work as follows:\n\nThe residual profit would be the profit remaining after applying a globally agreed deemed routine return on a multinational enterprise\u2019s activities.\n\nThe above calculation could occur by business-line, for multinational enterprises with segmented reporting.\n\nTaxing rights over a portion of the deemed residual profit would then be reallocated among market countries based on a simplified allocation key (for example, the value of sales).\n\nThe balance of the residual profit would continue to be taxed in the jurisdiction where it is generated (subject to a potential global minimum tax rule, about which the OECD intends to release a further consultation document next month).\n\nThe Unified Approach would also allow market jurisdictions to tax the return on so-called baseline distribution and marketing activities, where these are carried out by a subsidiary or physical permanent establishment of a multinational enterprise within the jurisdiction. The consultation document advocates using globally agreed fixed rates of return to calculate this taxable amount, perhaps on an industry basis, as a way of reducing transfer pricing disputes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe market jurisdiction would also have the right to tax the additional return, calculated under current transfer pricing rules, on any local \u201cbeyond-baseline\u201d activities.\n\nSo, where a multinational enterprise sells into market jurisdiction Z, Z would tax its share of residual profit based on the allocation key. If the enterprise carried out baseline activities through a physical presence there, Z could tax the return on those activities also, possibly according to a globally agreed formula. If the enterprise carried out beyond-baseline activities through that physical presence, Z could also tax the return on those activities, following current transfer pricing principles.\n\nPositive step towards consensus\n\nThe publication of the proposal for the Unified Approach is a positive step towards achieving international consensus. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming public consultation (closing date for submissions is November 12) will produce a wealth of constructive and practical input, in order that progress can accelerate from here.\n\nSuch acceleration is necessary if the goal of a consensus solution by the end of 2020 is to be achieved. Implementation would then take another two years.\n\nOf course, there are still obstacles but the prospect of failure is what gives this initiative impetus. An EU-wide digital tax for example, would be worse for many US companies than the OECD\u2019s proposals.\n\nIt is important for the global tax system that this plan succeeds.
