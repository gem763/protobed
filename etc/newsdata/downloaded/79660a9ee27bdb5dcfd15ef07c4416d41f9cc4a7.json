YPG fighters withdrew from this area under the terms of the ceasefire negotiated between the U.S. and Turkey last week.\n\nMost of the remaining 1,000 U.S. troops have redeployed to Iraq. A U.S contingent may remain in Deir ez-Zor to guard the region\u2019s oil supply but such a small presence would likely not have a meaningful strategic impact.\n\nBetween the lines: Despite fanfare in some quarters, the Russia-Turkey deal suffers from serious challenges.\n\nThe YPG is not party to the agreement and its fighters are unlikely to voluntarily abandon Syrian Kurds who live in these towns and villages within six days.\n\nIt's not clear that the Assad regime and Russia are in a position to directly compel their withdrawal (Damascus and Moscow are already in the midst of a campaign next door in Idlib province). Rather, Russia has warned the Kurds to pull out of the safe zone or risk being crushed by Turkey.\n\nDespite its assurances to President Trump, Turkey is still poised to press its invasion of northeast Syria. If it tries to fully clear the YPG from the border area, Turkey would once again employ its Syrian proxy militia, which has committed horrific abuses against Kurdish civilians in recent weeks.\n\nThe bottom line: Renewed conflict in northeast Syria is increasingly likely. Further violence could pave the way for ethnic cleansing, forcing hundreds of thousands of additional Kurdish civilians to flee their homes and letting Turkey resettle the safe zone mainly with Syrian Arab refugees.\n\nHardin Lang is vice president for programs and policy at Refugees International.", "description": "The Kurdish fighters are expected to withdraw but are not party to the agreement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/uMY81DQETENTPqa6ua1KBfhPmGI=/0x0:5760x3240/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571858446832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
