Nicola, who juggles work with looking after her daughter at their home in Ashford in Kent is a victim of the UK\u2019s growing gig economy \u2013 and she isn\u2019t alone.\n\nAs she says: \u201cI had to get out. I loved the people, loved caring, but there was never enough time. I didn\u2019t get paid for travel \u2013 or the extra time I spent with them because they are so lonely. I\u2019d get home two hours late and was always worried about money.\u201d\n\nNext month a new Ken Loach film, Sorry We Missed You, tells the story of people like Nicola. It follows the lives of a care worker and a courier driver, highlighting the damaging effects of these \u2018non-jobs\u2019, where zero hours and precarious agency contracts are now the norm.\n\nFellow care worker, Stevie Hookway, 30, from Barking in Essex, says she is depressed and in debt because of her job.\n\n\u201cYou never know how much you\u2019re getting paid. I\u2019ve had to choose which three bills to pay this month,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cYou only get paid for the time you spend in a client\u2019s house \u2013 not the hour it takes to get there on public transport. I\u2019m in rent arrears already and on top of work pressure, worrying about money is making me depressed.\u201d\n\nSadly Nicola and Stevie\u2019s stories are not unusual \u2013 with many British workers being forced to join this insecure gig economy.\n\nA staggering 4.7 million Brits, almost one in ten working-age adults are now working via a freelance platform. That\u2019s double the number from 2016, and 80 per cent are women.\n\nThe GMB union, one of those that represents British care workers, said its members were \u2018undervalued and underpaid\u2019.\n\nAnd a recent cross-party report into social care warns of a \u2018workforce crisis\u2019. When you hear what has happened to dedicated, compassionate staff like Nicola it\u2019s impossible to disagree.\n\nNew film exposes grim work reality\n\nFrom the team that brought you I, Daniel Blake comes Sorry We Missed You, a powerful exploration of the contemporary world of work.\n\nIn the fim, released in cinemas November 1, overworked contract nurse Abbie (Debbie Honeywood) cares for disabled and elderly people, often at the expense of tucking in her own children at night.\n\nThis raw tale shines a light on the injustice suffered by thousands of workers facing similar conditions, in the hope of change.", "description": "Poor pay and long shifts were too much for Nicola in an industry which features in new Ken Loach film 'Sorry We Missed You'", "authors": ["Claire Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560685.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Still-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
