Without worry, Dobnak and his girlfriend planned their wedding.\n\nNow he\u2019s getting married eight days after his first big league win.\n\nDobnak pitched 5 1/3 effective innings, and the Minnesota Twins beat the Kansas City Royals 4-3 on Friday night.\n\nThe Twins won for the sixth time in eight games to maintain their four-game lead over Cleveland in the AL Central. They reduced their magic number to clinch the division title to five with eight games to play.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m having the time of my life up here,\u201d Dobnak said.\n\nMarwin Gonzalez hit a two-run double for the Twins, and Miguel San\u00f3 had a run-scoring triple.\n\nKansas City has dropped seven of eight to fall to 56-99. It is one defeat away from its second consecutive 100-loss season and No. 6 in franchise history.\n\nThe Royals could give the majors four 100-loss teams in a single season for only the second time.\n\nDobnak (1-1) gave up one run and three hits in his fourth start and eighth major league appearance overall. He has surrendered two earned runs in 10 1/3 innings over his past two outings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pitched great for us,\u201d manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cHe certainly has earned that win, this year and big picture. He\u2019s certainly earned it.\u201d\n\nRoyals manager Ned Yost was impressed.\n\n\u201cI like the fact that he had run to his fastball,\u201d Yost said. \u201cHe had some sink to his fastball. He had some fastballs that were going two different ways. We thought he had a good slider. He had a real quick arm which had deception built in, especially on the slider.\u201d\n\nTrevor May struck out the side in his second save of the season.\n\nBaldelli said Dobnak will make one more appearance before leaving for his wedding in Williamsport, Maryland, on Sept. 28.\n\n\u201cThe best is yet to come, though, getting married,\u201d Dobnak said.\n\nSKOGLUND\u2019S OUTING\n\nEric Skoglund (0-2) gave up two runs and three hits in four innings for Kansas City.\n\nMinnesota jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first. Nelson Cruz hit a sacrifice fly, and San\u00f3 tripled home Jorge Polanco.\n\n\u201cI felt strong, honestly, from the beginning,\u201d Skoglund said. \u201cI walked the first hitter, unfortunately, and that grinds my gears a little. And then the second hitter got that little knock down the line. But other than that, I felt really strong.\u201d\n\nKansas City got one back on Alex Gordon\u2019s RBI double in the sixth, but Gonzalez responded with his two-run double in the bottom half.\n\nBUXTON UPDATE\n\nMinnesota outfielder Byron Buxton was back in the team\u2019s clubhouse after he had left shoulder surgery on Sept. 10.\n\nBuxton said the surgery was to repair the labrum and he\u2019ll be in recovery and rehab for four to six months. Buxton\u2019s left arm will be immobilized in a sling for six weeks. He hopes to be ready for the start of spring training next season.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit better than what they anticipated, which is a very good part,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things. Frustrating, but it\u2019s part of the process.\u201d\n\nBuxton got hurt when he collided with the center-field wall in Miami on Aug. 1.\n\n\u201cI think I just hit it at an awkward angle,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cI know I felt it when I dislocated it. But at the time, with the adrenaline pumping, you don\u2019t really think about it.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRoyals: DH Jorge Soler fouled a ball off the top of his left foot during an at-bat in the third inning and was checked out by trainers before staying in the game.\n\nTwins: 1B C.J. Cron started for the first time since Sept. 15. He is dealing with a bruised thumb. Baldelli said the team has \u201cbeen experimenting a little bit\u201d with some of the rehab work to allow Cron to return. Baldelli said Cron won\u2019t play every day but is feeling better.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals: Right-hander Glenn Sparkman (4-11, 6.02 ERA) will start against Minnesota for the fourth time this season.\n\nTwins: Right-hander Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos (13-8, 3.58 ERA) has given up just two runs in 14 1/3 innings over his last two starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two years ago, Randy Dobnak had no idea he would be pitching in the majors this September.
