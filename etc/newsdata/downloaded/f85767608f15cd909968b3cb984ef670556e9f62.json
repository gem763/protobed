(WEED.TO)(CGC) and Acreage Holdings Inc. (ACRG-U.CN)(ACRGF) are encouraged by growing support for cannabis reform in the United States, developments that could pave the way for Canopy becoming the largest player in the massive American market.\n\n\u201cMost large groups you talk to, whether Democrat or Republican, or American farmers, are in favour of state\u2019s rights progressing. I think that is a major step in the right direction,\u201d Canopy Growth chief executive officer Mark Zekulin told Yahoo Finance Canada in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really moved into the stage where there are a lot of details to work out, but we are past that principal question.\u201d\n\nCanopy Growth has a US$3.4-billion deal to buy 100 per cent of the shares of New York-based Acreage Holdings, a multi-state operator with dispensaries, cultivation sites and processing facilities across the U.S. The acquisition hinges on cannabis production and sales becoming federally legal in that country.\n\nThe District of Columbia and 11 states have adopted laws legalizing recreational cannabis. Illinois recently became the second most-populous state allow adult use.\n\nThe latest hope for broader cannabis reform came from the U.S. president last Friday. Asked by reporters if cannabis would be federally legalized while he is in office, Donald Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a very big subject and right now we are allowing states to make that decision. A lot of states are making that decision, but we\u2019re allowing states to make that decision.\u201d\n\nTrump has backed legalization of medical cannabis since his 2016 presidential campaign, and has previously said states should chart their own course on adult-use policy.\n\nSpeaking on a panel chat with Zekulin at the 2019 MJBizCon International Conference in Toronto on Thursday, Acreage Holdings CEO Kevin Murphy said Trump\u2019s latest remarks on cannabis are cause for optimism.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s signalling to the rest of his Republicans that you know what, it\u2019s basically okay to have a view around cannabis. The reason he is doing it is because in the United States 95 per cent of the country believes in medical cannabis, and 66 per cent believe in adult-use or recreational cannabis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur president clearly wants to be reelected in 2020. He wants to see his fellow Republicans get reelected. It\u2019s the popular thing at this point.\u201d\n\nZekulin said after 70-straight months of construction, Canopy is near the end of its Canadian infrastructure build-out and has \u201cnever been in a better place\u201d to shift attention to scaling operations in the U.S. and leverage its intellectual property in that market.\n\nMurphy said Canopy stands to benefit from Acreage\u2019s work on building popular brands free from the strict marketing restrictions in place in Canada.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that many of the brands worldwide have come from the U.S., I think that's probably the most important export,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe we can bring a lot of what we do here in the U.S. back to Canada. I think it\u2019s a two-way street.\u201d", "description": "The chief executives of Canopy Growth Corp. and Acreage Holdings Inc. are encouraged by growing support for cannabis reform in the United States, developments that could pave the way for Canopy becoming the largest player in the massive American market.", "authors": ["Jeff Lagerquist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4AmNxy_d4Bqj6cW5IF8Q6w--~B/aD0zMDI0O3c9NDAzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/2e3e6610-d016-11e9-bd62-e6051e802aa9", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
