The fact that a record number of Americans aren\u2019t making those payments is \u201cusually a sign of significant duress among low-income and working-class Americans,\u201d Long wrote.\n\n\u201cThe substantial and growing number of distressed borrowers suggests that not all Americans have benefitted from the strong labor market and warrants continued monitoring and analysis of this sector,\u201d Fed economists wrote in a blog post dissecting the report.\n\nA bonus just for you: Click here to claim 30 days of access to Business Insider PRIME\n\nThe data show that most of the borrowers whose auto loans have recently moved into delinquency are people younger than 30 years old and people with low credit scores. Eight percent of borrowers with credit scores below 620 \u2013 otherwise known as subprime \u2013 went from good standing to delinquent on their auto loans in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nAnd the data show that most delinquencies come from auto-finance lenders, rather than banks and credit unions.\n\nThe Fed found that half of outstanding loans from auto-finance companies are made to subprime borrowers, and 6.5% of those loans are more than 90 days overdue. That\u2019s compared with just 14% of outstanding loans from credit unions made to subprime borrowers, 0.7% of which are delinquent.\n\nThe delinquency figure represents a new high in the auto-loan market \u2013 more than 1 million more people are behind on auto-loan payments now than at the end of 2010. More people have auto loans now than in 2010, so while the overall rate of delinquency is down, the total number of people who have fallen at least 90 days behind their payments is higher.\n\nRead more: American household debt just hit a new record high\n\nThe Fed has been tracking the auto-loan industry for more than five years, the economists said in the blog post, and it\u2019s not the first time the group has sounded the alarm. In 2017, a quarterly report from the Fed highlighted the near doubling of the rate of delinquencies in subprime auto loans originated by auto-finance companies since 2011, Business Insider\u2019s Matt Turner reported.\n\nTurner also reported at the time that Wall Street was expressing concern over the subprime-auto-loan market as well. Meanwhile, Business Insider\u2019s Lauren Lyons Cole reported that Americans borrowed more money to buy cars than to attend college between 2016 and 2017.", "description": "Business Insider - Fed economists said the rise in the number of delinquent borrowers is \"surprising\" considering a strong labor market and economy..
