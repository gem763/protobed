The office also identified a white SUV as a vehicle of interest. The vehicle has a distinct light bar along the rear bumper, according to the video.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said it has footage from as many as nine cameras surrounding the area.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nSt. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said he believes as many as a dozen people were close by when the crash happened and asked for members of the public to come forward.\n\n\"We need your help,\" Cotter told reporters earlier this month, according to The Observer. \"So, if you know what had happened, if you were there -- frankly, if you\u2019re the person who was involved, we\u2019re asking you to come forward.\"\n\nTurgeon's family is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to prosecution.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nThe family said the young woman was in town for the Notre Dame vs. USC football game that weekend. It also created a memorial website called Forever Missed in her honor.\n\n\"A kind and loving individual, Hannah was loved by all who knew her. Hers was a young, happy life that was filled with friends and family, and with a bright future,\" the website said. \"Hannah always kept her family closest to her heart, always in touch. She connected with them frequently, whether flying home for family gatherings in southern California or joining in on family trips. Notre Dame football games were top of list, right up there with Hawaii.\"\n\nInvestigators said anyone with information should contact Michiana Crime Stoppers at 574-288-STOP or 800-342-STOP.", "description": "Officials with the St. Joseph County Prosecutor\u2019s office said they also obtained video showing the actual crash.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-gty-er-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
