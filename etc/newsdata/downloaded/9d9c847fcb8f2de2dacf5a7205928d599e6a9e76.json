It does need to be stamped out and dealt with wherever it raises its ugly head.\n\n\n\nSchools all over must and should be open to all the children of South Africa.\n\n\n\nBut to do away with the feeder system makes no sense at all. Schools are (always have been) built to accommodate kids from the area.\n\nIt makes sense, as that is where they live. To do away with that, means you have a situation where parents from all areas are now having to get their kids to school far away from home. This means more traffic every morning going in all directions - that makes no sense at all.\n\n\n\nI appreciate that some schools are better than others and therefore more desirable. I think this is the problem. We need to raise all government schools to an acceptable standard, making them all more desirable.\n\n\n\nIt is sad that apartheid spacial planning still dominates the landscape - but this is not the fault of the schools or the kids living close to said school.\n\n\n\nOur education system and disadvantaged schools need to be addressed and improved - and it is governments job to do this. They have had 25 years to attend to it, but are hamstrung by the union as well as their own ineptitude - not to mention corruption. Therefore it is their fault, and this situation needs to be placed on their doorstep - not on the doorstep of the kids living in that area.\n\nFor kids living in the southern suburbs to not be able to attend a school in their area, because kids from outside the area are being given the places based solely on race, is in itself racist. This cannot be the solution. The solution is to raise the level of schools in all areas, to acceptable levels, so that there is the option of a good school in the area of every kid in SA.", "description": "To do away with the feeder system makes no sense at all.
