It helps us realise we can consolidate success and continue playing our football even when down to 10 men.\u201d\n\nThe victory restored Inter\u2019s two-point lead over Juventus at the top of the table ahead of a meeting between the sides at San Siro next Sunday, while Sampdoria are rooted to the bottom of the table after taking three points from the opening six rounds.\n\nInter boss Conte made several changes to his side ahead of Barcelona\u2019s visit in the Champions League on Wednesday, resting Romelu Lukaku, Diego Godin and Nicolo Barella and giving Sanchez his full debut.\n\nIn a meeting of the top and bottom sides in the league, Inter got off to a fast start as Sensi\u2019s shot from distance took a big deflection off Sanchez on the way in and the goal was awarded to the midfielder despite the Chilean celebrating it as his own.\n\nSanchez needed only two more minutes to open his account for the club as he latched on to a mis-hit Sensi effort to slot home from close range.\n\nHowever, things took an ugly turn for the 30-year-old when he was shown a second yellow card for diving inside the box a minute into the second half, meaning he will be suspended for the clash with Juventus.\n\nThe incident spurred the home side into life and they were given hope when Jankto span in the box and fired a low shot into the bottom corner after 55 minutes.\n\nHowever, their rally was short-lived as Gagliardini pounced on an Emil Audero parry to bundle in a shot from close range and condemn Eusebio Di Francesco to his fifth defeat in six games as Sampdoria coach.\n\nAtalanta strengthened their grip on third place with a resounding 4-1 win at Sassuolo.\n\nGian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side put the result beyond doubt before halftime thanks to two goals from Alejandro Gomez and strikes from Robin Gosens and Duvan Zapata, while Gregoire Defrel netted a consolation for the visitors after the break.\n\nAtalanta occupy third place on 13 points but Napoli, Cagliari and Torino are behind them on nine points and can reduce the gap in Sunday\u2019s fixtures.", "description": "Alexis Sanchez scored and was sent off in his first start for Inter Milan as the Serie A leaders maintained their perfect record with a 3-1 win at Sampdoria on Saturday.
