The dossier\u2019s charges of Trump election conspiracy proved unfounded.\n\nMs. Powell is mounting a vigorous effort in federal court to dismiss the case against Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents in the Trump White House\u2019s early days. She accuses the Robert Mueller prosecution team of withholding evidence favorable to him.\n\nThe Mueller probe failed to establish an election conspiracy between Trump allies and Moscow.\n\nFlynn admitted to lying about discussions he had with the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions. He cooperated with the prosecution on a lobbying investigation unrelated to the 2016 election.\n\nMs. Powell said in her letter to Mr. Schiff that Flynn \u201cwill not appear before your committee on September 25, 2019 to be paraded, harassed or disparaged for doing so.\u201d\n\nShe accused Mr. Schiff of a \u201cdisregard for propriety, professionalism, prior practices and ethics in your theatrical demand.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
