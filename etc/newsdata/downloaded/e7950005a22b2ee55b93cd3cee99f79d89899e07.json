John Lewis, which has around 20 stores in covered shopping centres, said it had resorted to the action to try to get its landlords to help stop the service charge increases.\n\n\u201cAt a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centres,\u201d John Lewis said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOver the last three years we have seen an increase in service charges of 20% and these continued increases are simply not acceptable, particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs.\u201d\n\nJohn Lewis is seeking to get landlords to take on some of the service charge obligations during the fourth quarter, the most critical period of the year for retailers in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nThe retailer is contractually bound to pay the service charge under the terms of lease arrangements with landlords, and withholding payments could lead to legal action by property owners to recover unpaid bills. John Lewis\u2019s biggest landlords include Hammerson and Intu.\n\n\u201cWe are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers to grow footfall to our shops and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this,\u201d John Lewis said.\n\nEarlier this week, John Lewis Partnership, the parent company of John Lewis and Waitrose, announced a major restructure to merge management of its retail and supermarket operations to save \u00a3100m.", "description": "Retailer tells shopping centre landlords their service charge rises are unacceptable", "authors": ["Mark Sweney", "Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b3dcf4b82a9663ffd312bc7e5be4b010c8d500/0_110_3981_2388/master/3981.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85db0db96b6eb03a4a917f6f21efb73a", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
