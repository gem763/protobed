Luckily for dozens of people sitting in a nearby bar, the improvised car-bomb did not detonate \u2013 diesel is not particularly flammable \u2013 and they ran away, though it did not take long for police to track them down. Giligmann was arrested two days later trying to flee the country with her family, while Madani was arrested with two other members of the terrorist cell as they carried out a knife attack on a police officer, planned with the help of the group\u2019s mentor.\n\nThe jihadi women were inspired and loosely guided by Rachid Kassim, an Islamic State (ISIS, formerly ISIL) terrorist who had released a guide for prospective jihadists on how to commit attacks that included the gas cylinder method. Madani and Gilligan joined a Telegram channel operated by Kassim and sent him videos pledging allegiance to ISIS, as well as a video claiming responsibility for the Notre Dame attack before it failed.\n\nWhile the women admitted their complicity in the plot, each blamed the other for instigating the attack. Giligmann insisted she tried to sabotage the plot by using diesel instead of something more flammable. Madani only escaped a life sentence because of her relative youth, the prosecutor said \u2013 she was just 18 at the time of the attack, having been recruited herself by a prominent ISIS member she met online.\n\nAlso on rt.com 2 Paris police officers disarmed and suspended as department aims at radicalisation in its own ranks \u2013 reports\n\nGiligmann was initially lured into the cell by Madani, who posed online as a returned ISIS fighter looking for a bride to commit acts of terror with back in France. The pair exchanged over 4,000 messages on social media before they finally met, at which point Madani pretended to be the phantom fighter\u2019s sister. Madani was additionally sentenced to eight years in April for attempting to recruit for ISIS over the internet, using her fighter persona to urge others to commit attacks in France and Belgium or join the caliphate in Syria.\n\nTwo other members of the cell, Sarah Hervouet and Amel Sakaou, received 20 year sentences for assisting Madani in the attack on the police officer. Another, Samia Chalel, was sentenced to five years for helping to hide Madani. Kassim was sentenced to life in prison in absentia, though he is believed by US authorities to have been killed in a drone strike near Mosul, Iraq in 2017.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
