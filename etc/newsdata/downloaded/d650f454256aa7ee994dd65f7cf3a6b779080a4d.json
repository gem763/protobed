Mandatory Credit: Matt Roberts-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Former world number one Rory McIlroy will represent Ireland at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and not the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team.\n\nMcIlroy, ranked second, is one of the favorites to qualify. The top 15 ranked players when the qualification period ends in June 2020 automatically qualify, with a maximum of four per country, in a field that will include 60 golfers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to play the Olympics and call myself an Olympian,\u201d McIlroy told the Golf Channel ahead of this week\u2019s Zozo Championship in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cComing to such a golf-crazy country like Japan helps. It\u2019s a really good atmosphere and just being here this week and seeing the enthusiasm of the fans makes me look forward to coming back next year and playing the Olympics.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy opted out of the 2016 Rio Olympics when golf made its much-awaited return to the program due to concerns over the mosquito-borne Zika virus.\n\nThe 30-year-old is eligible to play for both Team Great Britain and Ireland but decided to play for the latter, the same country he represented at the amateur level.\n\n\u201cI think I made it more difficult for myself than I needed to,\u201d he said, explaining his decision.\n\n\u201cMy feelings towards it were more about what other people will think. Once I got that out of my head and decided to do what was best for me, it became easy.\n\n\u201cThe decision was that I was going to play golf for the country or nation that I\u2019ve always played golf for \u2014 through my junior and amateur days, and now into my professional career.\u201d", "description": "Former world number one Rory McIlroy will represent Ireland at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and not the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444199634&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1QN-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
