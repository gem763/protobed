Dick's Sporting Goods isn't the only one", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE CEO Ed Stack said rather than returning the firearms banned by the company to manufacturers, the chain \"sawed $5 million worth of rifles into scrap.\" USA TODAY\n\nInstead of returning firearms to their manufacturers, Dick's Sporting Goods destroyed $5 million worth of rifles as part of its tough stance on guns, CEO Ed Stack said.\n\nThe retailer is one of the companies that sell firearms and ammunition to pull some of those products from their shelves in the wake of mass shootings, declining sales and public pressure to do so.\n\nDick's took it a step further and turned the assault rifles into into scrap metal, Stack revealed in his new book.\n\n\"I said, 'You know what? If we really think these things should be off the street, then we need to destroy them,'\" he also told CBS News.\n\nHere's a look at steps some companies have taken to limit gun and ammo sales:\n\n'Need to destroy them': Dick's Sporting Goods destroyed $5 million worth of assault rifles, CEO Ed Stack says\n\nDick's Sporting Goods\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting in Florida left 17 dead in February 2018, Dick\u2019s banned sales of assault-style weapons, pulled high-capacity magazines from stores and halted the sale of firearms to anyone under 21.\n\nDick's had previously removed AR-15s from its stores after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. However, the company was still selling assault-style weapons at its 35 Field & Stream locations before its decision last year to halt those sales.\n\n\u201cWe found out we sold this kid a shotgun and I said, \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d Stack said on CBS of the then-19-year-old alleged Parkland shooter. \u201cEven though that\u2019s not the gun he used, it could have been.\u201d\n\nIn March, Dick's announced it was removing firearms from 125 of its stores amid slumping sales.\n\nWalmart\n\nIn 2015, Walmart halted sales of military-style rifles.\n\nThree years later, following the Parkland shooting, Walmart also prohibited sales of firearms and ammo to anyone under 21.\n\nThe retailer announced in September that it would stop selling handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition as well as handguns in Alaska, the one state where it still allowed such purchases.\n\nThe changes shrunk Walmart's ammunition market share from roughly 20% to between 6% and 9%, Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs said at the time. The retailer makes up about 2% of the gun market.\n\nWalmart also began asking customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores, even if states where the law permits it.\n\nThose moves followed a string of shootings in August, including one at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead.\n\n\"We just hope that customers will understand the rationale behind this, that it is not an attempt to question their legal rights,'' Bartlett said at the time,\n\nKroger\n\nKroger exited the gun business entirely in 2018 when it stopped selling firearms and ammunition at its Fred Meyer stores that sell both food and general merchandise.\n\nIn September, it also began asking customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores.\n\nL.L. Bean\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, L.L. Bean said it would no longer sell guns or ammo to anyone under 21. The company sells firearms for hunting at its flagship store in Maine.\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko, Charisse Jones and Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY; Alexander Coolidge, Cincinnati Enquirer; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/08/dicks-sporting-goods-walmart-kroger-gun-ammo-sales-limits/3908609002/", "description": "Dick's Sporting Goods\u00a0destroyed $5 million worth of rifles.
