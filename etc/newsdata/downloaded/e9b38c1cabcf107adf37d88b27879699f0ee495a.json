I wasn\u2019t Elton, I was Reg,\u2019 the singer explained referring to his birth name Reginald Kenneth Dwight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And Reg was still the same as he\u2019d been 15 years ago, hiding in his bedroom while his parents fought: insecure and body-conscious and self-loathing. I didn\u2019t want to go home to him at night. If I did, the misery could be all-consuming.\u2019\n\nElton is now happily married to David Furnish (Picture: Getty Images )\n\nAccording to Elton, he took a drug overdose one night while recording with his new band at Caribou studios but can\u2019t recall what pushed him to try and take his own life.\n\nHe revealed: \u2018I can\u2019t remember what exactly prompted me to do that, although it was probably some catastrophic love affair gone wrong.\u2019\n\nElton admits his relationships were intense but flippant as he\u2019d eventually grow \u2018bored\u2019 and move onto another romance.\n\n\u2018And after three or four months they\u2019d end up resenting it, I\u2019d end up getting bored with them, and it would end in tears. And then I\u2019d get someone else to get rid of them for me and start again,\u2019 he revealed.\n\nOf course, the singer is now happily married to husband David Furnish and the couple share two sons, Zachary, eight, and Elijah, six.\n\nAnother of Elton\u2019s suicide attempts in 1975 was depicted in his recent biopic, Rocketman, in which he was played by Taron Egerton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe: Elton John is out on 15 October.\n\nNeed support?
