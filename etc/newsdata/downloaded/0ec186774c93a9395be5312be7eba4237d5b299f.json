REUTERS\n\nHistory and hindsight may apply some inevitability to the result, but it would have been irresponsible to completely count Poirier out of this fight before it had begun; \u2018The Diamond\u2019 was cut with care and patience, defeating numerous dangerous opponents on his way to this, his first undisputed world title fight after eight years in the UFC, and he entered the main event in fine form.\n\nThe 30-year-old from Lafayette, Louisiana was riding a four-fight win streak, which included victories over Eddie Alvarez and Anthony Pettis (both former UFC lightweight champions), Justin Gaethje (a former World Series of Fighting lightweight champion) and UFC featherweight champion Max Holloway. Three of those four victories came by stoppage, and the other earned him the right to be called interim lightweight champion.\n\nAnd though form is temporary, Poirier possesses a rare class. He also possesses a rare versatility, exhibiting remarkable proficiency in various facets of fighting \u2013 he has achieved 12 wins by knockout, seven by submission and six by decision \u2013 demonstrating that the Louisianan is not limited to one road to victory.\n\nBut Nurmagomedov was a brutal roadblock on Saturday, halting the momentum that Poirier had built up over the past two years.\n\nSave for a promising moment at the start of the main event\u2019s second round, when Poirier propelled himself at Nurmagomedov with a series of staunch strikes and backed up the somewhat startled Russian, \u2018The Eagle\u2019 was never truly in trouble.\n\nNurmagomedov showed no signs of ring rust whatsoever, despite the contest marking his first since defeating Conor McGregor last October in Las Vegas.\n\nOn that night, the lasting image was of \u2018The Eagle\u2019 living up to his nickname and launching himself into the crowd to attack McGregor\u2019s teammate and jiu-jitsu coach, Dillon Danis, but on Saturday there was no such brawl, only brilliance from the champion.\n\nRepeated takedowns saw him control his challenger against the fence for the majority of the fight, wearing Poirier down with his weight and pressure. He used his impeccable technique to tie up Poirier on the ground, sapping his opponent\u2019s stamina while asserting his dominance, and when Poirier briefly wriggled free at the end of the first round, Nurmagomedov initiated a violent assault with fierce ground strikes.\n\nTo Poirier\u2019s credit, he never stopped working, and even managed to rise to his feet on several occasions. He also tried desperately to counter Nurmagomedov\u2019s takedowns with submissions \u2013 most notably a guillotine choke, though actually decapitating the Russian might be the only way of stopping him at this point.\n\nEither way, \u2018The Diamond\u2019s\u2019 defiance did little but delay the inevitable.\n\nHalfway through the third round \u2013 halfway through the fight \u2013 Poirier\u2019s spirit broke as Nurmagomedov finally synched in the rear naked choke that he had been seeking throughout the contest.\n\nAs he sunk in the submission \u2013 as \u2018The Eagle\u2019 sunk in his talons \u2013 Poirier almost visibly experienced the same epiphany that everyone else has when sharing the octagon with Nurmagomedov: he is unbeatable, and he is undisputed.", "description": "Diamonds may form under extreme pressure, but even for Dustin \u2018The Diamond\u2019 Poirier, the pressure of Khabib Nurmagomedov was too much on Saturday at UFC\u00a0242.
