REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne said that the couple, Australian Mark Firkin and British-Australian Jolie King who live in Perth, returned to Australia and all charges against them were dropped after weeks of \u201cvery sensitive negotiations\u201d with Iran.\n\nGlobal media had said they were detained over accusations of flying a drone without a permit.\n\nThe couple said in a statement issued through the foreign ministry that they were \u201cextremely happy and relieved to be safely back\u201d home.\n\n\u201cWhile the past few months have been very difficult, we know it has also been tough for those back home who have been worried for us,\u201d they said.\n\nTheir arrest came amid a standoff between Western powers and Iran after the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran and imposed sanctions on it, aiming to halt its oil exports.\n\nOn Saturday, Iran\u2019s official IRIB news agency reported that an Iranian university student who had been arrested in Australia on charges of exporting American military radar equipment to Iran to help the country\u2019s defence program has returned to the Islamic Republic after 13 months in detention.\n\nReza Dehbashi, a student at the University of Queensland, was facing extradition to the United States and was freed because of Iran\u2019s diplomatic efforts, according to IRIB.\n\nDehbashi was doing research on a machine used for detecting skin cancer and has denied all charges about the export of military equipment to Iran, IRIB reported.\n\nAnother British-Australian, identified earlier by her family as University of Melbourne academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, though, has not been released by Iran. She has been in detention in Tehran for a year.\n\nMoore-Gilbert\u2019s case was complex, Payne said.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing our discussions with the Iranian government,\u201d she added. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the charges upon which she was convicted and we will seek to have her returned to Australia.\u201d\n\nIn September, Iran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency quoted a judiciary spokesman as saying the three Australians had been detained for spying.\n\nFirkin and King said they would not comment further on their detention.\n\n\u201cWe know there are others who remain in detention in Iran, including a fellow Australian, and believe intense media coverage may not be helpful for efforts to bring them home,\u201d they said.", "description": "An Australian couple who spent more than three months in a prison in Tehran has been freed, Australia's foreign minister said on Saturday, and an Iranian news agency later reported that an Iranian student was released from detention in Australia.", "authors": ["Lidia Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437273417&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9402C", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
