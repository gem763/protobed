We haven't said anything about ether\u2014until now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.\u201d\n\nThe Commission has never declared unambiguously the regulatory status of the asset. Though in 2018 the Director of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bill Hinman, suggested that it was \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d and likely not an unregistered security, the comments today mark the first time a U.S. regulator has opined on the subject with any level of certainty.\n\nFears over whether the cryptocurrency constituted a security have been amplified over the past year, as regulators crack down on the sale of Ethereum-based tokens through so-called initial coin offerings, many of which breached the century-old Howey test. That test determines an asset is a security if, among other things, the value of the asset depends on the entrepreneurial efforts of a third party.\n\nBecause the original multimillion dollar Ethereum token sale was orchestrated by a select few, the currency\u2019s regulatory status has long been in question.\n\nBut Tarbert\u2019s comments are not conclusive on the matter of whether ether is a security. As Compound Finance General Counsel Jake Chervinsky pointed out on Twitter, \u201cThe CFTC calling ETH a commodity has nothing to do with securities laws at all. Securities are a type of commodity. Financial instruments can be one, both, or neither. Not to mention that the SEC already said ETH isn't a security last summer.\u201d\n\nPer Yahoo, Tarbert reportedly added that \u201cforked\u201d assets like Ethereum Classic should be granted the same regulatory status as the original assets. \u201cIt stands to reason that similarly assets should be treated similarly,\u201d said Tarbert, who joined the Commission in July, according to Yahoo. \u201cIf the underlying asset, the original digital asset, hasn\u2019t been determined to be a security and is therefore a commodity, most likely the forked asset will be the same.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year the Commission, which is regarded as being more tolerant toward cryptocurrencies, sought advice about virtual assets, including ether, from developers and entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The long-awaited verdict is in: Ethereum is (probably) a commodity, and the CFTC is open to futures trading.", "authors": ["Ben Munster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KpiApV8zaBAqZfnMPmTEYw--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/b254843ac4b9642409faec244f908f0c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
