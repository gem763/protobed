According to Variety, Adam Driver is in early stage talks for a lead role in The Last Duel, and the part is one previously thought to be played by Affleck. The plot concerns two friends who are French soldiers in the 14th century, and one returns from war to find that the other has raped his wife, who will be played by Jodie Comer. Previous reporting suggested that Affleck would play one of those soldiers, but word is now that he has transitioned to a supporting character, with Driver stepping into the bigger part. (Affleck\u2019s schedule apparently wouldn\u2019t allow for a lead commitment due to his work on the movie Deep Water, says Variety.)\n\nWhen the solider learns of his wife\u2019s assault he appeals to the crown for justice by duel. Language around the movie is skirting the rape and revenge aspect, with Last Duel being described as \u201can epic tale of betrayal and justice, told from three distinct points of view: two knights (Damon and Driver) whose bond is tested by treachery and a young woman (Comer) forced to navigate the brutal and oppressive culture of the era in order to survive.\u201d Affleck and Damon are writing the script with Nicole Holofcener. For all these potential attachments, Disney and Fox have not yet given the film an official green light. So, stay tuned.", "description": "Adam Driver is in talks to join Ridley Scott\u2019s film \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d which will star Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Jodie Comer, and is being co-written with Nicole Holofcener.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/22/22-adam-driver.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
