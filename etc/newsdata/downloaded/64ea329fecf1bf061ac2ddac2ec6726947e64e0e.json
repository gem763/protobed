That version of the show lasted for only about a year before returning to its more classic format.\n\nHill negotiated a buyout of her own $10 million contract more than a year ago and currently writes for The Atlantic. Prior to hosting \"SportsCenter\" together, Smith and Hill had co-hosted another ESPN show called \"Numbers Never Lie\" (which later was renamed \"His & Hers\") for more than five years.\n\nSmith did not divulge the exact financial terms of his ESPN exit, but he told the New York Post in an interview: \u201cI was ready for a new chapter. I was ready for a new challenge. I\u2019ve been at ESPN for 15 years. I\u2019ve worn pretty much every hat imaginable. Realistically, the opportunities that were available to me at this point, I don\u2019t know how much growth they truly represented, especially compared to this opportunity. I think what we are going to do for athletes and content creators throughout the industry when it comes to storytelling and when it comes to content development and distribution, it is going to be significant, impactful and disruptive.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS", "description": "ESPN host Michael Smith agrees to buyout of $10M contract.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Michael-Smith-GettyImages-813110784.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
