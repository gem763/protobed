Peng was allegedly paid between $10,000 and $20,000 to make the drops.\n\nThe government alleges that Peng, a tour guide and sight-seeing operator in San Francisco, would go into hotel rooms in Georgia and California and ask for a hotel key left for \"Ed.\"\n\nThen, the government alleges that once inside the room, the SD card was stored in a container similar to a \"cigarette pack\" placed by a double agent, someone who was really working for the United States.\n\nOnce Peng picked up the package, he would fly back to China with the SD card dropped off by a source.\n\n\"The confidential human source chose to report MSS's engagement with him to the FBI and chose to cooperate in this criminal investigation. As alleged in the complaint, the defendant in this case made the wrong choice, the defendant chose to work as a secret agent for the MSS's spy network,\" U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California David L. Anderson said at a press conference.\n\nKate Munsch/Reuters\n\nPeng and the Ministry of State Security handler would often speak in code on the phone -- such as referring to an upcoming trip to China as a trip with the \"educational company.\" In a drop in Georgia, Peng flew from California to make the drop and collected $20,000, according to the government.\n\n\"Peng was observed taking large sums of money from a hotel dresser drawer and removing a hidden disc from the dresser, which contained information intended for the Chinese government,\" Bennett said.\n\nPeng is due in court on Oct. 2.\n\nThe Justice Department has stepped up its enforcement of cases related to China.\n\nIn January, Chinese company Huawei and Skycom were charged with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, among other charges. Huawei and Huawei USA are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice related to a grand jury investigation in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nHuawei Chief Fiancial Officer Meng Wanzhou is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracies to commit bank and wire fraud, then-then-acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said at a news conference.\n\nEarlier this month, a Chinese woman was found guilty of trespassing at Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump's Florida club. She had several electronic devices, including one used to find hidden cameras, in her hotel room when she was arrested.", "description": "The DOJ alleges that a naturalized U.S. citizen was working with the Chinese government.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/david-anderson-rt-jef-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
