That\u2019s something we could work on. Breakdown work \u2013 we gave a couple of balls away. We\u2019ve got to be a bit better in our support play.\n\n\u201cI said that we are 15 points from three games; we are where we need to be and we haven\u2019t played to our best yet \u2013 which is good, because we\u2019ve got growth and that\u2019s what this competition is about. It\u2019s about growing, it\u2019s about building, it\u2019s about being right when you need to be right.\u201d\n\nWhy Gareth Southgate\u2019s lead?\n\nAt the 2018 Fifa World Cup, Southgate made eight changes to his starting England line-up for a match where Belgium manager Roberto Martinez also made nine changes, confirming that victory was not the top priority. England went on to lose 1-0, ensuring they avoided Brazil and France in the knockout stage.\n\nSomething similar could well happen on Saturday, with France also expected to make a number of changes having already qualified for the last eight, and whoever loses the match will be confirmed as Pool C runners up and likely face Wales in the quarter-finals, with the pool winners meeting Australia instead.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the semi-finals that could be Jones\u2019s focus, as if England do finish second, they would not be able to play the All Blacks until the World Cup final at the earliest, increasing the likelihood of another team knocking out the reigning world champions before they could face off with England.\n\nSo should Jones do it?\n\nOn the face of it, rotating the team with the desire to win it and top the pool seems to be best and most sensible option. England saw what could happen with Billy Vunipola on Saturday, who in his 12th consecutive start limped off at half-time with an ankle injury that England are confident will not be serious.\n\nHowever, it would be an unnecessary risk for the Australian to play his front-line lieutenants such as captain Owen Farrell, fly-half George Ford, centre Manu Tuilagi and lock Maro Itoje in case much worse happens. In fact, five of the squad have started every match so far in Japan in Ford, Joe Marler, Tom Curry, Billy Vunipola and Elliot Daly, and it would be a smart decision to give all of them a breather ahead of the knockout stages.\n\nIn Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, England have three players in desperate need of match minutes, who would greatly benefit from getting a full game under their belts, fitness permitting.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say they should throw the game though. First place in Pool C may well lead to a semi-final against the All Blacks, but if England should get to the latter stages of the competition, they must have a mentality of not being afraid to face \u2013 and beat \u2013 New Zealand.\n\nThe All Blacks joined England in the quarter-finals on Saturday with the largest win of the competition so far, a 71-9 win over Namibia with a heavily-rotated side, to put down a marker that they will not be relinquishing their grip on the Webb Ellis Cup. They also sent out something of a statement with their victory over South Africa at the start of the tournament, something England haven\u2019t really done yet and possibly will not do until the quarter-finals.\n\nThat\u2019s why victory over France matters. No one really fears England at the moment based on what they\u2019ve seen in Japan. Of course they are a good side that pose a threat to any other team, but the only challenge they\u2019ve truly faced so far came in the first 18 minutes of the Argentina game, when the opposition still had 15 players. If England were to rotate the side and still do a number on France, it would at least allow the squad to feed off that momentum, as right now, the jury remains out on Jones\u2019s side.", "description": "Eddie Jones appears prepared to follow in the footsteps of Gareth Southgate and rotate his England\u00a0side against France\u00a0even if it costs them the match, with defeat ensuring they avoid New Zealand until the Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/14/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
