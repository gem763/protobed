Instead, we\u2019ve spent the entirety of 2019 grinding up and down in a sine wave. I consider the horizontal I\u2019ve drawn below to be resistance of medium-strength importance.\n\nIWM Chart\n\nIn a very similar fashion, the Transports (the Dow 20) fund, , is approaching a level of somewhat important resistance, which is the price gap where that horizontal line is anchored.\n\nIYT Chart\n\nThe is going to be heavily influenced by some monster earnings report over the next two weeks. As with the DIA, it has had three distinct instances of approaching lifetime highs. At the moment, it is precariously perched on the trendline going all the way back to the March 2009 low.\n\nQQQ Chart\n\nOne constant ally on the NASDAQ which is starting to look a little shaky is the semiconductor fund, symbol . It had a clean breakout on Tuesday, but that fizzled the reset of the week, closing at the week\u2019s low.\n\nSMH Chart\n\nSo, overall, equities are poised for new highs but look quite vulnerable. One key deciding factor, I believe, is going to be the chart below \u2013 \u2013 the (bonds). If the selling in bonds has abated, and these can start to gather strength again, it\u2019ll drain the air right out of equity\u2019s tires.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Tim Knight covering: Dow Jones Industrial Average, Boeing Co, SPDR\u00ae Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, NASDAQ Composite.
