The Pope had wanted to work in the country as a missionary in his youth but the plan was abandoned following a lung operation.\n\nThe Shinto Buddhist country is home to some 450,000 Catholics and 510,000 Protestants.\n\n\"During the latter visit, the Holy Father will visit Tokyo, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima,\" said the statement, adding that an official schedule will be provided on a later date.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki were decimated after the US dropped atomic bombs at the end of Second World War in 1945.\n\nMore than 140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima, while the port city of Nagasaki suffered a death toll of 74,000 after the Americans dropped the atomic bombs.\n\nThe Pope has referenced the bombings in the past.\n\nIn January last year, he printed cards with a 1945 photo of victims of the Nagasaki bombing, inscribing the words \"the fruit of war\" in Italian on the card above his signature.\n\nThe photo, captured by American photographer Joe O'Donnell, showed a young boy standing ramrod straight carrying his dead younger brother on his back while waiting for his turn at a cremation site.\n\nSince Pope Francis' election five years ago, he has made two trips to Asia, visiting the Philippines and Sri Lanka in 2014, followed by Myanmar and Bangladesh last year.\n\nburs-dhc/je", "description": "Pope Francis will travel to Thailand in November, the Vatican said Friday, in a visit to Asia that will sweep in Japan and the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which were both decimated by atomic bombs in 1945.
