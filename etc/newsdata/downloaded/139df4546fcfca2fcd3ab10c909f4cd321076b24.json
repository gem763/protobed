Overnight, investors were worried that the Chinese delegation would leave after only one day of talks and even early in the morning, every one was unclear as to how the primary talks would go. The uncertainty was so high that market watchers resorted to dissecting the body language of everyone arriving. By the end of the NY session, the came roaring back after President Trump tweeted that he will meet \u201cwith the Vice Premier Friday at the White House.\u201d However in the same tweet, he left the market guessing by saying, \u201cThey want to make a deal, but do I?\u201d\n\nWith the outcome of the trade talks still unknown, there could be more fireworks in the next 24 hours. If President Trump agrees to a partial deal with China, will make a run for its 1-month highs, near 108.50. Other major currencies should benefit from risk-on flows as well with testing 1.1050 and heading toward .6850. If negotiations fail and China leaves with no agreement, we\u2019ll see Thursday\u2019s gains reverse quickly with USD/JPY and AUD/USD feeling the brunt of the pain. While it may not be wise to bet on a deal, President Trump\u2019s willingness to meet with Vice Premier Liu He is a sign that a positive outcome is likely. It would also effectively distract news agencies from the impeachment inquiry.\n\nA trade deal would also reduce the chance of further easing from the Federal Reserve this month. Price pressures are subdued according to the latest consumer price index, which showed inflationary pressures stagnating in September. CPI growth was unchanged although , prices ticked up slightly. Softer economic reports have little effect on the this week as the prospect of global growth hinges on the trade talks.\n\nMeanwhile, rose more than 2% against the US dollar after Prime Minister Johnson and Ireland\u2019s Varadkar said they \u201csee pathway\u201d to a Brexit deal. No details were provided but Sky News reported that Britain is proposing a limited free-trade agreement. The talks now move to Brussels were Brexit secretary Barclay will meet with the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Barnier. We\u2019re skeptical that the EU will find any agreement palatable but investors are latching onto any piece of good news as the price action reflects a great degree of optimism. Of course, sentiment could shift quickly if Germany or the EU casts doubt on a deal so it's unadvisable to rush into any major positions before a firm outcome is known.\n\ntraded above 1.10 for the first time in 2 weeks. Although Germany\u2019s and numbers missed expectations, the European Central Bank said a number of members opposed Quantitative Easing and felt that it should be the last resort. However with the region\u2019s largest economy headed for recession, we are skeptical of the durability of EUR/USD\u2019s rally. Investors and the ECB were hoping that the German government would support the economy with fiscal stimulus but based on Thursday\u2019s comments from German finance minister Scholz, who said the country already has an expansive policy and that stimulus may not come easily.\n\nAll three of the commodity currencies traded higher Thursday on trade-talk optimism but the will be the one to watch Friday. are scheduled for release and economists predict a significant slowdown in job growth. According to , Canadian companies shed jobs at the fastest pace since 2016. USD/CAD should rally on Friday\u2019s report but the forecasts are low, so the Canadian dollar\u2019s reaction will depend on the extent of the surprise.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD.
