Or was it a warning to the former secretary to keep her mouth shut? In a brief Q&A as he left the White House for Camp David, Trump told the press yesterday that Westerhout had done a good job, but that she had trusted the media a little too much to keep its word about \u201coff the record\u201d:\n\nPresident Trump on Madeleine Westerhout: \"She called me. She was very upset. She was very down.\" https://t.co/rzNoWG2d64 pic.twitter.com/lerlXjvd70 \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) August 31, 2019\n\n\u201cI guess she said some things. She called me. She was very upset. She was very down,\u201d Trump said. \u2026 Trump on Friday chastised the media, claiming they leaked the details of the off the record conversation and calling them \u201cdishonest.\u201d \u201cBut still, you don\u2019t say things like she said, which were just a little bit hurtful to some people,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, so good. Trump sounded as though he genuinely liked Westerhout and wished her well. This morning, however, Trump extended his remarks on her firing by noting that Westerhout had signed a non-disclosure agreement when she came to work for Trump at the White House. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll have to sue her to force Westerhout to abide by it, but \u2026.\n\nWhile Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it. She called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany, doing great! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2019\n\nNice career ya got there, this seems to hint, shame if anything \u2026 happened to it. Lest Westerhout miss the point or believe this to be an empty threat, Trump followed it up with this reminder:\n\n\u2026Yes, I am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements. Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one. I gave her every break, despite the fact that she was despised by everyone, and she went for some cheap money from a book. Numerous others also! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2019\n\nHad Trump just stopped at yesterday\u2019s statement on the White House lawn, he might have gotten credit for a moment of rare grace. His most ardent defenders might still claim that Trump\u2019s follow-up tweets are still complimentary to Westerhout, but come on, man. That\u2019s barely a tangent to what is clearly a threat to make Westerhout\u2019s life miserable if she decides to talk about what she knows, or especially if this unemployed 29-year-old woman needs \u201csome cheap money from a book.\u201d\n\nThat hardly sounds as though Trump \u201cfully understood and forgave\u201d Westerhout. At the same time, though, it\u2019s tough to blame Trump for being sore about what Westerhout leaked. This wasn\u2019t someone blowing the whistle on official misconduct; Westerhout passed along personal gossip that seemed designed to hurt the one daughter who has pointedly stayed out of the public eye since her father got elected. NDAs are not bulletproof, especially when it comes to public malfeasance, but gossiping about First Family dynamics shouldn\u2019t qualify as an exception to a signed agreement. In fact, that might be one of the more acceptable uses of an NDA.\n\nOne has to wonder, however, why Trump made this threat public. He could just as easily have had his attorneys send her a private reminder of the NDA while publicly offering sympathetic words over the predicament into which the big bad media put Westerhout. That might have given the impression that any information Westerhout has represents no big threat to Trump. Instead, by going public, Trump looks like a bully and is waving a big red flag about Westerhout\u2019s potential for damage to every media outlet and book publisher in America. He\u2019d better hope that Westerhout is, and remains, a \u201cvery good person.\u201d", "description": "Unlike Omarosa.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trump-westerhout.png"}
