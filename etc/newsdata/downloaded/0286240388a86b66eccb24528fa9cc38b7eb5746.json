The Houston Astros clinched their ticket to the ALCS. Here's everything you need to know heading into the league championship series. USA TODAY\n\nThe World Series is guaranteed two new representatives in the Fall Classic.\n\nThe defending champion Boston Red Sox failed to earn a postseason berth and the Los Angeles Dodgers were eliminated in Game 5 of the National League Division Series.\n\nHere are the four divisional series survivors \u2013 New York Yankees, Houston Astros, St. Louis Cardinals and Washington Nationals. Now it's down to the best-of-seven League Championship Series.\n\nThe Yankees and Cardinals are two of baseball's most iconic franchises, combining for 38 championships. The Astros have reached the World Series twice, winning in 2017 and the Nationals are one of two franchises who have yet to appear in the Fall Classic.\n\nSo we ask: What would make the most compelling and intriguing World Series?\n\nUSA TODAY Sports ranks the potential matchups based on sizzle and watchability:\n\nAaron Judge looks to lead the Yankees to the World Series. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n1. Yankees-Cardinals\n\nLikely dream matchup \u2013 at least for executives at Fox Sports, which will broadcast the World Series. The Yankees (27) and Cardinals (11) rank No. 1 and No. 2 for most World Series championships, respectively. They have combined to appear in 59 of the 114 contested Fall Classics, yet have only met five times. The Cardinals lead the series 3 games to 2, with the Bob Feller-led Cardinals winning their last matchup in 1964.\n\nAaron Judge and Paul Goldschmidt would headline this series once held by Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby and Joe DiMaggio and Stan Musial.\n\n2. Astros-Nationals\n\nA World Series pitching duel? It would be a battle of aces.\n\nThe Astros are stacked with two 2019 Cy Young candidates \u2013 Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole \u2013 and former winner Zack Greinke. The Nationals are loaded as well with Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin.\n\n3. Astros-Cardinals\n\nIn 2017, MLB punished the Cardinals for hacking the Astros\u2019 email system and scouting database. It's payback time. What better way for Astros general manager and president of baseball operations Jeff Luhnow to get back at his former employer.\n\nAnd let's not forget the two franchises were once rivals in the National League Central before the Astros moved to the American League West in 2013.\n\n4. Yankees-Nationals\n\nThere's not much history between the two franchises. In fact, they are quite the opposite when it comes to the history books. The Yankees have 27 championships to the Nationals none. Thanks to inter-league play, the two clubs have played each other 32 times, with the Yankees holding the edge 17-15.\n\nBut, wouldn't it be fun to watch Scherzer's intensity in the Bronx against Judge and Giancarlo Stanton?", "description": "What would make the most compelling and intriguing World Series?
