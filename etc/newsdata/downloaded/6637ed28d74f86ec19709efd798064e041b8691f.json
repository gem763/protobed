Nevertheless the game ended on a sour note for Guardiola as Fernandinho was sent off for a second yellow card and will be suspended for the Carabao Cup game against Southampton on Tuesday.\n\nChristian Pulisic celebrated his first start since August with a hat-trick as an improving Chelsea cruised past a potential banana skin on their visit to Burnley.\n\nPulisic's hat-trick and a goal from Willian put Chelsea 4-0 up by the hour before late goals from Jay Rodriguez and Dwight McNeil restored some respectability to the scoreline for the home team.\n\nMarcos Rashford and Anthony Martial both missed penalties, but atoned with goals from open play as Manchester United won 3-1 away to Norwich City.\n\nScott McTominay put United ahead after 20 minutes and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side led 3-0 before Onel Hernandez netted a late consolation for Norwich.\n\nArsenal were denied a late winning goal by the VAR, which ruled out Sokratis' late goal which would have made it 3-2 at home to Crystal Palace.\n\nRather than dwelling on the decision Arsenal would be better focusing on how the visitors were able to come back from goals from Sokratis and David Luiz after just nine minutes and take a point thanks to Luka Milivojevic and Jordan Ayew and also looking at Granit Xhaka's gestures to the home fans as he left the pitch after being substituted.\n\nA late own goal from defender Lucas Digne condemned Everton to a 3-2 defeat away to Brighton and keeps the pressure on coach Marco Silva.\n\nEverton had led 2-1 with just 10 minutes left thanks to an own goal in their favor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 74th minute goal, but Michael Keane was harshly adjudged to have fouled Aaron Connelly and Neal Maupay levelled from the spot.\n\nThe scene was then set for Digne's 93rd minute tragedy as he slid a cross into his own net to give Brighton three points that lift them above Everton in the table.\n\nWatford remain without a win this season as they were held 0-0 at home to Bournemouth and Watford have keeper Ben Foster to thank for a string of saves to give then a point which keeps them in touch with safety despite their dreadful start to the campaign.\n\nNewcastle edge out of the bottom three despite being held to a 1-1 draw by Wolves. Jamaal Lascelles put Newcastle ahead in the 37th minute, but Wolves took a point thanks to Jonny Castro's 72nd equalizer following an error from home keeper Martin Dubravka.\n\nNewcastle's afternoon got worse in the closing minutes when Sean Longstaff was sent off following a wild tackle on Ruben Neves.\n\nSheffield United remain unbeaten away from home on their return to the top-flight after Lys Mousset's third goal of the season cancelled out Robert Snodgrass' opener for West Ham.\n\nMeanwhile Friday night saw Leicester City make Premier League history as hat-tricks by Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy helped them to a 9-0 win away to Southampton, which is the biggest away victory in the history of the competition.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db64126a310cf3e97a328fd.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
