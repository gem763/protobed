Fresh off a stint on The Bachelor, during which Colton Underwood dumped her in an airplane hangar, Brown didn\u2019t have much money. (Contestants on the show do not get paid, and they have to buy their own wardrobes, which MONEY has previously reported can cost them thousands of dollars.)\n\nBrown\u2019s career was messy, too: She\u2019d initially wanted to be a broadcast journalist, but her time was consumed by her Miss Alabama USA duties and an interior design job.\n\nNow, though, she is finally getting her finances in order.\n\n\u201cI still need to hustle and make some money, but I\u2019m doing a lot better than $70,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe Bachelorette gig likely earned Brown about six figures, but 2019 has been a whirlwind for the former pageant queen nonetheless. Not only did she break hearts and famously hook up in a windmill during her season, but she broke off her engagement after learning fianc\u00e9 Jed Wyatt hadn\u2019t been honest about his romantic past. Single, living in Los Angeles and dedicated to rehearsing for DWTS, Brown said she\u2019s currently trying to boost her credit and determine her next steps.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to just move on my own to a new city and just see where life\u2019s going to take me,\u201d Brown told NPR in August. \u201cAnd I feel like it\u2019s going to be really good.\u201d\n\nBachelor Nation stars often take on second careers as influencers after their time on the show. Posting ads can be lucrative \u2014 according to Refinery29, a person with 1 million followers can earn $10,000 for each #sponsored post they make.\n\nHowever, Brown said she\u2019s wary of going down that path.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be selling SugarBearHair [gummies] and FabFitFun boxes,\u201d Brown told Marie Claire. \u201cIt\u2019s been sickening how much money I\u2019ve passed up\u2026 because I\u2019m not doing the low-hanging fruit.\u201d\n\nBrown isn\u2019t the first Bachelor/ette to work hard before and after spending time on the show. Travis Lane Stork, the season eight Bachelor, was an emergency room doctor in Colorado and went on to host the talk show The Doctors.
