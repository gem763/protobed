The letter also notes a Wall Street Journal report about Chao's failure to divest from the Vulcan Materials Company.\n\n\u201cSeveral reports indicate that you have used your official position to benefit Foremost Group, a shipping company owned by your father and sisters that is headquartered in New York and operates a fleet that transports materials to and from China,\" the letter read.\n\nChao has no formal role with Foremost Group. Her father founded the company, and her sister, Angela Chao, is CEO.\n\nPOLITICO has also reported on the amount of time Chao spent early in her tenure engaged in \"private meetings,\" as well as the access she granted to Kentucky officials, including tasking one of her inner circle with being a special liaison between Chao and Kentucky issues.", "description": "The committee sent Chao a letter asking her for all communications since President Donald Trump\u2018s inauguration between DOT and the Foremost Group.", "authors": ["Tanya Snyder"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/db/bb/02481b814822ac7cfab5bc0519d6/190916-elaine-chao-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
