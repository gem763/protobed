Majorities in both parties voted in the House last week to register their disapproval of the decision.\n\n\u201cThis week, 61 percent of Republicans say they support President Trump\u2019s decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria, compared to 56 percent who said the same last week,\u201d said Sinclair. \u201cThe president\u2019s [overall] standing among Republicans also remains strong, as 84 percent approve and 14 percent disapprove of his performance.\u201d\n\nBut while there is little public support overall for Trump\u2019s decision, he is trying to tap a vein of U.S. public opinion that is skeptical of the country\u2019s numerous military entanglements overseas. Two in three voters, 67 percent, agree that the U.S. is engaged in too many foreign conflicts, the poll shows.\n\nAt the same time, voters will support foreign intervention under certain circumstances. Nearly as many voters, 65 percent, say they agree with the statement, \u201cThe U.S. needs to be involved in foreign conflicts to support our allies, fight terrorism and maintain our foreign policy interests.\u201d\n\nThe Syria decision is only one front of Trump\u2019s fights with Congress in recent weeks. The new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows little change in voters\u2019 views of the impeachment inquiry in the House. In the new survey, 49 percent of voters support the inquiry, while 43 percent oppose it. That is virtually identical to last week, when 50 percent supported the inquiry and 42 percent opposed it.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s approval rating in the survey is 41 percent, while 56 percent of voters disapprove of his job performance. That is also statistically unchanged from last week, when 40 percent of voters approved of Trump and 57 percent disapproved.\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted Oct. 18-21, surveying 1,989 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\n\nMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents: Toplines: https://politi.co/31BQfvG | Crosstabs: https://politi.co/2p48nRL", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6d/7e/9bd3f8b4441ba815c1fe5c61d900/20191022-turkish-army-tank-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
