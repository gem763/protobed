While that boast is arguable in many cases, when it comes to autumn colour, the New World wins hands down.\n\nIn much of the northern hemisphere, leaves turn soft yellow and brown, with a splash of red here and there. But these are mere Roman candles compared to the pyrotechnics in North America. Photographs can\u2019t do justice to the startling scarlet, gold, purple and orange that blaze across hills and sweep into valleys. Views are beautiful for the first-timer \u2013 but just as memorable the 50th time around. Best of all, this annual show is absolutely free.\n\nThe shimmering hues follow the Appalachian Mountains from eastern Canada down to North Carolina, but the must-see region is New England. What makes it special are its russet-red barns and white farmhouses, steepled churches and village greens \u2013 all photogenic props for the pageant.", "description": "Paul Wade and Kathy Arnold tell you all you need to know about viewing the spectacular display of autumn colours in New England", "authors": ["Kathy Arnold", "Paul Wade", "Destination Expert"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/July/GettyImages-10029420-%25281%2529-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
