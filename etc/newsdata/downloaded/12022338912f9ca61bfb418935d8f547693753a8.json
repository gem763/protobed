I repeat, Blake Lively has popped. The baby is here.\n\nThe unnamed third child (we\u2019ll call it Blyan for now) joins the couple\u2019s two daughters James Reynolds, 4 and Inez Reynolds, 2.\n\nBlake has kept the whole pregnancy on the down low, she didn\u2019t even announce it until she was seen with a rather large bump at the Detective Pikachu premiere alongside hubby Ryan Reynolds in May. The Gossip Girl star then took to Instagram to announce that PokeMOM was \u201cout now\u201d.\n\nView this post on Instagram PokeMOM\u2026. Out now. A post shared by Blake Lively (@blakelively) on May 11, 2019 at 9:31am PDT\n\nConsidering how little we\u2019ve been updated during Blake\u2019s pregnancy, it\u2019s unsurprising to hear that bebe number 3 might\u2019ve actually been born nearly two months ago. Huge, I know. I could barely keep a secret quiet for two minutes, let alone something this big for nearly two months.\n\nThe couple is notoriously tight-lipped when it comes to their kids and family life, so we don\u2019t have any specifics when the Reynolds family officially became a party of five, but an anonymous source told Us Weekly that the baby is \u201cabout two months old.\u201d\n\nLively told Marie Claire back in 2016 that she was pretty keen on giving her kids a normal upbringing, which seems really difficult when your mum is Serena Van Der Woodsen and your dad is fucking Deadpool.\n\n\u201cRyan had a nice, normal upbringing, and we want our kids to have the same normal life that we had,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever want to rob them of what we had, because we\u2019d feel really selfish.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I love that they\u2019re just trying to live their lives in peace. A part of me wants to see every juicy detail of their personal lives, but I\u2019m also a huge fan of them focussing on raising their kids out of the public eye.\n\nBlake and Ryan haven\u2019t personally confirmed the birth, and we know literally nothing about the mystery bebe, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not losing my fucking mind over it. Neither of the a-list actors are too keen on posting photos of their kids on social media, so maybe we won\u2019t even get a baby pic. Who knows?\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to update you all as soon as we\u2019ve got some baby snaps or an official word from either of the parents, if that day ever comes. Maybe we\u2019ll get a going off to college pic in roughly 20 years.", "description": "Hollywood couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have welcomed their third baby into the world, apparently two months ago.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1146575761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
