home 30 years after Wall\u2019s fall", "language": "en", "text": "Glindenberg (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 For years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the mantra for millions of former East Germans was to \u201cGo West\u201d for better jobs and opportunities.\n\nBut three decades on, an increasing number are returning to their roots to seek a fresh start.\n\nWith new industries taking shape and offering a variety of career paths, better childcare options and relatively cheap housing, the former communist states are starting to look a lot more attractive to young families.\n\nTake the Hoffmanns for instance.\n\nPeggy, 29, had wanted to return to the office full-time after having two children, but in western Germany, she felt a stigma associated with working mums.\n\nUndeterred, she looked all over and finally found a job in insurance in the eastern city of Magdeburg last year.\n\nCrucially, another key piece of the puzzle fell into place quickly \u2014 a full-day childcare spot for her two sons rather than the half-day offers in the west.\n\n\u201cFor a woman who works, that\u2019s the dream,\u201d said Peggy, in her apartment in Glindenberg, a village in the suburbs of Magdeburg.\n\nDespite the initial reluctance of her husband Carsten, the family moved back to the couple\u2019s native state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n\n\u2013 Brain drain \u2013\n\nA decade ago, she had joined Carsten in Stuttgart, where he had gone for his studies, driven, he said, by a wish to \u201cdiscover something new\u201d.\n\nThe return \u201cwas very difficult for me in the beginning,\u201d said the 33-year-old, explaining that he had to give up a full-time job in the knowledge that wages in the east lagged behind those in the west.\n\nBut he, too, managed to find employment and without taking a pay cut.\n\nThe Hoffmanns are the kind of family that Saxony-Anhalt and the other former communist states badly need.\n\nWhile regional and federal governments have pumped hundreds of billions of euros (dollars) into reviving the east, companies drawn by subsidies and other favourable conditions complain that any investment plans are often hampered by the severe lack of skilled workers.\n\nThe east \u201clost about 1.2 million people between 1991 and 2017\u201d, said Nico Stawarz, researcher at the Federal Institute for Population Research in Wiesbaden.\n\nThe first exodus wave came right after reunification, when the communist-run industries collapsed.\n\nThe second wave happened in 2000, when unemployment shot up to almost 20 percent among the working-age population.\n\nAnd it was the young and well-educated who fled, leaving a fast-ageing population behind.\n\nThe researcher noted the difficulties of making up for such a dramatic brain drain, but said that the positive trend was that the outflow has stopped.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Better quality of life\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn a recent study, the institute noted that in 2017, for the first time, the number of arrivals in the east was higher than departures \u2014 even without taking Berlin into account which for years has seen this trend.\n\n\u201cWe see positive developments in the east,\u201d Stawarz said.\n\nThe economy is perking up, unemployment rates are falling and attractive urban centres with universities are gaining attention.\n\nEven though there are no global statistics, several reports document a rise in the returns of the so-called \u201cOssis\u201d (after the word Ost for East).\n\nMost are between 29 and 45 years old, having spent about a decade in the west, started a family and are returning \u201cfor a better quality of life\u201d, said Stawarz.\n\nAmong the pull factors are more comprehensive childcare, lower property prices and proximity to older relatives.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not at any price\u2019 \u2013\n\nLocal governments have also pulled out all the stops to attract the sons and daughters of the region back.\n\nSaxony state has set up an office called \u201cReturn, Saxons\u201d, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has its \u201cmv4you\u201d while Saxony-Anhalt has gone with a \u201cWelcome Centre\u201d to help ease their returns.\n\nNot to be outdone, the Christian Democrats in Thuringia are proposing to offer 5,000 euros ($5,500) as a bonus for returnees.\n\nJob fairs are also organised annually, particularly on December 27 \u2014 a strategic date as families typically return then to visit elderly relatives over Christmas.\n\nThe regions have no choice but to roll out the red carpet, said Kerstin Mogdans, who coordinates help for returnees at the \u201cWelcome Centre\u201d in Magdeburg, and who took care of the Hoffmanns.\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t move here at any price,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important for the companies to know that they need to present attractive offers.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wall in their heads\u2019 \u2013\n\nA year after their move, the Hoffmanns say they feel at home now.\n\nSoon, they\u2019ll move from their rental apartment to a house they bought in Glindenberg.\n\nEven if they felt at home in the west, they said they were sometimes surprised to hear people say during a conversation dismissively: \u201cYou are such an Ossi.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d said Peggy, \u201cBut we told ourselves, well the fact that this separation once existed is still in their heads,\u201d even among the generation born after the fall of the wall.\n\nIn fact, on returning to Saxony-Anhalt, they found themselves labelled \u201cWessis\u201d for Westerners.\n\n\u201cBut since then, we\u2019ve been able to dispel the misunderstanding,\u201d she said, with a broad smile.", "description": "Glindenberg (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 For years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in
