But Is He Hurting the Cause?", "language": "en", "text": "David Siders is a national political correspondent for POLITICO.\n\nDENVER\u2014Tom Sullivan, a Colorado state lawmaker whose son, Alex, was killed in the Aurora theater shooting in 2012, met Beto O\u2019Rourke one cloudless morning in September and, inside a glass-and-brick office building in downtown Denver, introduced him to several other people whose friends or relatives had been killed in mass shootings.\n\nThey were seated at a table in a third-floor conference room of the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association, beside a largely untouched basket of bagels and a box of Starbucks coffee. Jane Dougherty, whose sister Mary Sherlach was murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, brought up the moment, at a presidential debate in Houston the previous week, when O\u2019Rourke had said, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think I was jumping around in my family room, because my sister was murdered by an AR-15,\u201d Dougherty said.\n\nConi Sanders, whose father, Dave, was killed in the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School, where he was a teacher, said she had rushed toward the television in her living room, hurting her head on a door jamb before sitting down on the floor and watching in disbelief. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d Sanders said. Brandon Kellogg, a student at Columbine during the massacre, said that, sitting on his couch watching the debate that night, he cried.\n\nO\u2019Rourke swallowed.\n\nIn March, when the former Texas congressman entered the presidential race amid soaring expectations, his biggest liability was a perceived lack of solemnity. That perception was reinforced by a meandering road trip throughout the Southwest, a \u201cborn to be in it\u201d Vanity Fair cover story, and a penchant for standing on tables and chairs. Then, he sank in public opinion polls, watched his fundraising fall off and drifted throughout the early stages of the primary, overwhelmed by a field of more experienced competitors.\n\nBut now O\u2019Rourke, while still running far behind in the 2020 field, finds himself at the center of one of the Democratic primary\u2019s gravest and most divisive policy disputes. After the shooting massacre at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, in August, O\u2019Rourke proposed a mandatory buyback of all assault weapons\u2014a kind of eminent domain for guns. The proposal\u2014and the pressure it has put on his competitors to respond\u2014has amplified the gun control discussion in the 2020 primary and pushed it further to the left. And O\u2019Rourke\u2019s intense focus on the issue, including events like the one in Denver, has given his faltering campaign new meaning.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue to keep this issue front and center if we\u2019re going to make any progress on it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told me recently over pasta at Fish Nor Fowl, a restaurant in Pittsburgh\u2019s east end, during a campaign swing through Pennsylvania on the day he turned 47. \u201cAnd I have an opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nHow long O\u2019Rourke will have that opportunity is unclear. He is polling at 2 percent or 3 percent nationally in the primary. And, he told me, \u201cI cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I\u2019m not the nominee.\u201d\n\nBarring upheaval in the primary, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s focus on gun control will not make him president. More than that, he might be hurting his own crusade. His buyback proposal thrust him into conflict, not only with President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association, but with some of his party\u2019s leaders, who fear O\u2019Rourke will alienate moderate voters and hinder Democrats\u2019 ability to negotiate more modest gun reforms in Congress, especially if the Senate remains in Republican hands after the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal,\u201d Trump tweeted last month, and many Democrats on Capitol Hill agreed.\n\nO\u2019Rourke acknowledges that calling for a mandatory buyback \u201cmay be politically difficult\u201d and \u201cmight diminish our prospects in the next election, whether you\u2019re a member of Congress or whether you\u2019re a candidate for the presidency.\u201d But he also believes his critics are misreading shifts in public opinion. Near the end of the meeting in Denver, he pledged, \u201cI\u2019m in all the way.\u201d\n\nLonnie Phillips, whose daughter was killed in Aurora, told O\u2019Rourke that he had \u201cstepped in shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to come after you,\u201d Phillips said, while assuring O\u2019Rourke that he has \u201can army behind you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t back down,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n***\n\nO\u2019Rourke no longer owns a gun, but he grew up around them in West Texas. He told me his father, Pat, kept a handgun in his sock drawer and an inherited \u201carsenal\u201d of handguns, shotguns and rifles in a basement closet. O\u2019Rourke used to take a .22-caliber rifle into the desert to shoot bottles and cans, and he has gone hunting with friends.\n\nEarly in his near-miss Senate run against Ted Cruz last year, a friend advised O\u2019Rourke to \u201cmake sure that you\u2019re seen in church every Sunday, make sure that they get a picture of you wearing boots and carrying a gun around,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAnd I was just like, you know what, none of that is me. I don\u2019t go to church every Sunday. I don\u2019t carry a gun. I don\u2019t have a gun.\u201d\n\nDuring his Senate campaign, O\u2019Rourke supported renewed efforts to pass an assault weapons ban. But running in a Republican- and gun-rich state, he repeatedly said he had no desire to take weapons from people who already owned them. Early in his presidential run, O\u2019Rourke pursued a standard Democratic menu of gun reforms, including universal background checks and red-flag laws.\n\nThe idea of a mandatory buyback, he said, \u201cjust was not part of the dialogue. And it doesn\u2019t justify the position or make it OK \u2026 but that is, perhaps like a lot of people, where I was.\u201d\n\nThat changed after a gunman wielding an AK-47-style rifle killed 22 people in El Paso. On the morning of the shooting, O\u2019Rourke was speaking at a labor forum in Las Vegas and became shaken when the first reports of deaths came in. \u201cKeep that shit on the battlefield,\u201d he pleaded, before suspending his campaign and returning home to mourn the victims and meet with survivors.\n\nThen he asked himself, \u201cWhat is the most that we could possibly do?\u201d\n\nGathered around his dinner table one day, he said he told a clutch of advisers, \u201cI can\u2019t escape the conclusion that if we want to stop selling these, then we should also buy the 10 million or more that are out there off the streets. I said, \u2018Give me the best argument against this.\u2019 And the only real argument against it was a political argument.\u201d\n\nUntil the El Paso shooting, O\u2019Rourke told me, \u201cI never forced myself to answer the question, \u2018If it\u2019s important to stop selling these, then shouldn\u2019t we do something to address the fact that there are those weapons of war out on the streets or in people\u2019s homes that can and will be used against us?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how to say it other than, \u2018The reason I never asked myself that question is I just never entertained the possibility that it was possible.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke is now calling for a mandatory buyback for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback for handguns. The funding for the buybacks, he says, would come from increasing the excise tax on gun manufacturers and increasing fines on traffickers. People who do not sell back their assault weapons would be fined.\n\nThe proposal is similar to a policy advanced by one of his former competitors, California Congressman Eric Swalwell. Now it is O\u2019Rourke arguing, as Swalwell did with less notice, that Democrats have approached gun control negotiations all wrong, by allowing gun rights activists to frame the parameters of the debate. At a recent campaign event, former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, an early O\u2019Rourke supporter, told me, \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fearless way that my candidate is speaking the truth to people.\u201d Swalwell said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cHell yes\u201d answer \u201cgave me goosebumps.\u201d And David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, said on Twitter that O\u2019Rourke \u201cis really moving on this issue of banning assault weapons. Very, very powerful.\u201d\n\nAt his rallies, O\u2019Rourke still swivels from impeachment and climate change to immigration and jobs. He is not a single-issue candidate. But it is on gun control that he is distinguishing himself. He told me he \u201ccan certainly tell from the way that people have responded and their passion around gun violence, that this has resonated, and that they associate me with this issue.\u201d\n\nDuring an early October town hall at Casa del Mexicano, a cultural center in Los Angeles\u2019 Boyle Heights neighborhood, an elderly woman in the crowd winced when O\u2019Rourke described the impact of an AR-15 or an AK-47, saying, \u201cYou talk to the surgeons who treat the victims, and they say it just shreds to shit everything inside of your body.\u201d A high school student told O\u2019Rourke that \u201call of my friends are scared\u201d that they will be shot at school, and asked him, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d O\u2019Rourke, sweating through his shirt, his sleeves rolled up, told her, \u201cWe are not going to accept what is happening right now,\u201d and he suggested that young people would alter the politics surrounding the issue. A cheer went up when he repeated his \u201cHell, yes,\u201d refrain.\n\nFor the purposes of the election, an adviser to one of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s competitors told me, \u201cHe did the smart thing, which was to take the pure position.\u201d\n\nThe adviser added, \u201cI don\u2019t know quite what it\u2019s adding up to.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nFor a Democratic presidential candidate, taking a stand on gun control would appear to be advantageous.\n\nBulletproof backpacks hit the market, active shooter drills have become commonplace in schools, and gun policy ranks among Democratic voters\u2019 top concerns. Forty-five percent of Americans worry they or someone in their family will be victimized in a mass shooting, according to Gallup. In the midterm elections last year, Everytown for Gun Safety, the pro-gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, spent millions of dollars, and gun control advocates claimed a number of victories in congressional swing districts.\n\n\u201cThe myth that gun safety is the \u2018third rail\u2019 of American politics, I think, is buried,\u201d says John Feinblatt, Everytown\u2019s president. \u201cCandidates are now running on their gun safety credentials from Day 1. \u2026 That\u2019s just a seismic shift.\u201d\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released in August found that 60 percent of voters support a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons, and 82 percent favor requiring people to be licensed before purchasing a gun. Support for a mandatory assault weapon buyback program is more mixed\u201446 percent, according to Quinnipiac, or 52 percent according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. But support for a mandatory buyback soars among Democratic voters, reaching 71 percent in the Quinnipiac poll. Even in Texas, 49 percent of the state\u2019s voters support a mandatory buyback, according to a University of Texas, Tyler, poll released after the Houston debate.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who frequently cites the Texas poll, told me, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s without any money being spent to support that position. That\u2019s without\u2014with the exception of Eric Swalwell\u2014without a single national political figure advocating for or endorsing the idea. So that\u2019s just where people are.\u201d\n\nSenators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have expressed support for a mandatory gun buyback, but the vast majority of the Democratic candidates have not. The field\u2019s early front-runner, Vice President Joe Biden, came close to endorsing the idea over the summer, in a CNN interview, before his campaign clarified that Biden supports a voluntary\u2014not a mandatory\u2014buyback. He has since proposed giving people who own assault weapons or high-capacity magazines a choice: sell them back or register them.\n\nOther candidates don\u2019t just oppose buybacks; they also criticize O\u2019Rourke for advocating one. At a gun control forum in Las Vegas in early October, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said buybacks have had \u201cmixed results\u201d and questioned the utility of pursuing them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something now,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd we have a way sometimes as a party\u2014my party\u2014of getting caught just when we\u2019ve amassed the discipline and the force to get something done right away, a shiny object makes it harder for us to focus.\u201d\n\nWhen O\u2019Rourke appeared at the forum that same afternoon, he condemned Buttigieg\u2019s rhetoric. To \u201cthose who are worried about the polls and want to triangulate or talk to the consultants or listen to the focus groups\u2014and I\u2019m thinking about Mayor Pete on this one, who I think probably wants to get to the right place but is afraid of doing the right thing right now\u2014to those who need a weatherman, let me tell you that in this country, mandatory buybacks are supported by a majority of Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke told me, \u201cI think that the political leadership, including Democrats, has not caught up to where the people are on this.\u201d\n\nThe reaction to his \u201cHell, yes\u201d moment underscores his point. Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island said on Fox News after the debate that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cmessage doesn\u2019t help,\u201d while Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told CNN, \u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue that a lot of gun owners have is that they think Democrats want to take away their guns,\u201d says Mathew Littman, a former Biden speechwriter who now supports Harris and works on gun reform. \u201cSo, saying that you want to take away their guns may prove that they\u2019re right. And the problem with it is gun owners and non-gun owners agree on so many things that we could do\u2014universal background checks, red-flag laws. Why don\u2019t we start on the areas we agree upon?\u201d\n\nSure enough, Republicans pounced on O\u2019Rourke for his buyback plan. A GOP state representative in Texas tweeted, \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis,\u201d while the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, rejoiced that O\u2019Rourke \u201cwill never be a threat in Texas politics again.\u201d John Thomas, a Republican strategist, told me he is using O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks to raise money for congressional races in New York, California and Michigan.\n\n\u201cBeto has fundamentally shifted the messaging on guns in the Democratic primary going forward,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a second-tier candidate in the next debate, why wouldn\u2019t you go even a step further than that? Say, \u2018Yes, why stop there? We\u2019ve got to do the sin tax on guns, tax ammunition and guns, and give the proceeds to gun victims.\u2019\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke could have expected blowback from the right, but he was incredulous at the Democratic criticism of his plan. After Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader with a long record on gun control, brushed aside mandatory buybacks, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke,\u201d the candidate responded by telling reporters to \u201cask Chuck Schumer what he\u2019s been able to get done.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u201cSomebody told me\u2014I don\u2019t know if this is true\u2014that the average attention span nationally on gun violence after a horrific mass shooting is three weeks,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at our dinner in Pittsburgh. He said he does not sense that this time\u2014not for the electorate and, he added, \u201cNot for me.\u201d\n\nYet it is possible that national attention has already moved past O\u2019Rourke two months after the El Paso shooting and one month after the Houston debate. After the impeachment inquiry into Trump engulfed Washington, Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who had been in talks with the White House on gun control, acknowledged that the turmoil \u201cmay temporarily be the end of the road for a lot of legislative initiatives,\u201d including on guns. In the presidential campaign, the topic has reverted from its once-charged status to its usual, less prominent place among other priorities.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, like many congressional observers, was never optimistic for negotiations with Trump on gun control. Long before Democrats opened their impeachment inquiry, the Republican president spurned a universal background checks bill passed by the House. Talks between Democrats and the White House, O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cnever seemed on.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s own proposal has been criticized as politically impractical or potentially unconstitutional. When CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo told O\u2019Rourke last month that he doubted the legality of mandatory buybacks, O\u2019Rourke replied that under the Second Amendment, \u201cthe government does have a power to regulate those kinds of weapons that are extraordinarily unusual or deadly.\u201d He told Cuomo he is \u201cwilling to fight that one all the way to the end.\u201d\n\nThe measure O\u2019Rourke is proposing, he says, is not unlike laws banning any other illegal weapon or substance. \u201cWe don\u2019t go door to door to enforce any part of the criminal code,\u201d he told me, \u201cnor would we in this case.\u201d When asked whether penalties could include imprisonment, he said, \u201cA fine, certainly. I don\u2019t know about imprisonment. But it\u2019s something that I\u2019d like to listen to.\u201d\n\nIn its uncertainty\u2014surrounding the specifics of the legislation that O\u2019Rourke would support, as well as its prospect of passage\u2014O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal is not unlike plans advanced by Democrats on any number of issues, including health care and climate change. And politicians of both parties have long found political value in advancing agendas that are not immediately likely to pass.\n\nAlthough O\u2019Rourke\u2019s buybacks proposal has had little effect on his campaign\u2019s weak polling, it has allowed him to \u201cput a mark in the book on something relevant,\u201d says Doug Herman, a Democratic strategist. \u201cIt takes him out of the abyss and puts him on the trampoline to another office.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke, for now, rejects that possibility. When I pressed at our dinner in Pittsburgh whether any other political office might appeal to him\u2014if not a run for Senate, which he has consistently resisted, perhaps Texas governor, even mayor of El Paso\u2014O\u2019Rourke said no. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you all the reasons why,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t win the presidency, O\u2019Rourke said that \u201cin whatever way I can contribute, I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d\n\nHe recalled Lonnie Phillips telling him in Denver that if O\u2019Rourke stopped talking about gun control, he would be \u201cpissed,\u201d and Sean Whalen, a pediatric dentist whose patient was shot to death last year, warning him that \u201cif you lose this election or you don\u2019t get the nomination, if you walk away from this, I would be personally offended.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke told me, \u201cI\u2019m in this for the long haul.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: 2020", "description": "The candidate\u2019s proposal for a mandatory buyback has put him at the center of the gun control debate.
