But rowdy fans at Nationals Park were not alone. Leftists on Twitter also indulged themselves.\n\nThe list of those releasing Twitter venom is long.\n\nTrump was booed by a stadium full of baseball fans at Sunday night\u2019s World Series game in D.C. pic.twitter.com/6KIZRV0Odj \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 28, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s own fault that he was booed at the Nats game https://t.co/QCM2BRB9oy \u2014 Eugene Robinson (@Eugene_Robinson) October 28, 2019\n\nBack off, haters! Yes, Trump was booed at the World Series but only because Crooked Hillary filled the stadium with the 3 million paid illegal immigrants that registered & voted against him 2016. And the poor guy just realized that Matt Gaetz isn't Barron. \u2014 John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) October 28, 2019\n\nI thought a lot of people were exaggerating when they were tweeting about major media pundits defending Trump from being booed but actually\u2026it's so much worse.

It wasn\u2019t protesters crashing one of his hate rallies or official appearances, & it wasn\u2019t Twitter. What we heard last night was what the majority Americans feel & that should be acknowledged, not criticized #TrumpBooed #ImpeachmentTaskForce https://t.co/jXaDsCWkDD \u2014 Tara Dublin Rockstober (@taradublinrocks) October 28, 2019\n\nThe real problem is that Trump isn\u2019t being booed every waking moment of his life until his last tendril of sanity snaps like that guy in the Edgar Allen Poe story. \u2014 Amanda Marcotte (@AmandaMarcotte) October 28, 2019\n\nTheory: How angry someone is about Trump getting booed is directly proportional to their secret fear that they themselves probably deserve a robust booing. \u2014 Amanda Marcotte (@AmandaMarcotte) October 28, 2019\n\nTwitter\u2019s top focus isn\u2019t #Baghdadi killing or #CaliforniaFires, but #TrumpBooed by @Nationals fans. Re-upping my tweet after WH announced he was going. In a free society, an unpopular @potus will hear boos. Trump was only surprised bc/ his aides lacked the courage to warn him. https://t.co/qUWZOhr4Gy \u2014 Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) October 28, 2019\n\nThe whole World Series stadium booed Trump. This is why he doesn\u2019t make public appearances outside his walled garden cult rallies. It\u2019s time for every MAGAt out there to come down back to earth, turn off Fox News and realize they\u2019re not living in the reality. #TrumpBooed pic.twitter.com/vCKuyME11W \u2014 Max Howroute\u25ab\ufe0f (@howroute) October 28, 2019\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @WTHuston.", "description": "Liberals on Twitter went wild with delight after Nats fans booed President Donald Trump at Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AFP1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
