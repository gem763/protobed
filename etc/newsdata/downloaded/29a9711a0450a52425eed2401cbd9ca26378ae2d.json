Michael McCaul, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the Democrats\u2019 process \u201cundemocratic.\u201d\n\nHe said he spoke with Senate counsel who confirmed the senators would consider the fairness of House investigations in their impeachment trial, if it comes to that.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing today could jeopardize everything they are trying to achieve in the Senate,\u201d Mr. McCaul of Texas added.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely impeachment would fair well in the Senate either way.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber rules would require a trial, but Republican senators are unlikely to actually convict and remove President Trump.\n\nThough earlier this month, he vowed to kill the impeachment push in a campaign video posted to Facebook.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly slammed House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a \u201csham process\u201d and \u201ckangaroo court\u201d over the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cThey are rushing to judgment,\u201d Mr. McCaul said. \u201cThey know if they don\u2019t get it done now, it\u2019s not going to stick with the American people.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on allegations that the president and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to pressure Ukrainian leaders to open an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a Democratic presidential front-runner for 2020, and his son Hunter.\n\nThey\u2019ve demanded that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hold a full House vote to authorize the investigation and grant equal subpoena power to both parties, as was done in previous impeachment processes.\n\nAs it stands, Republicans have no subpoena power to call their own witnesses.\n\nIf they did, they\u2019d use it to look into the origins of the allegations and whether or not it was an orchestrated attempt to undermine Mr. Trump by calling in the whistleblower and other anonymous sources cited in the initial complaint, members told reporters.\n\nThey would also like to talk to former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, who was reportedly brought up behind closed doors on Monday and allegedly attempted to push back against Mr. Giuliani\u2019s involvement in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf Chairman Schiff decides to bring Mr. Bolton in, we\u2019ll have questions for him,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, said, referring to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
