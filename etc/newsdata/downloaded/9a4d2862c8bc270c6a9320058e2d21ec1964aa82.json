We noted that U.S. indices have respected key support levels along with , which paints a glimmer of hope we could be headed for a bout of risk-on. If so, it could provide the FTSE100 with a much-needed tailwind and help it break to a new cycle high.\n\nWe can see on the daily chart that yesterday\u2019s bullish candle closed just off the highs of a 3-week range. Moreover, Wednesday\u2019s low reaffirmed support around 7,200 before heading higher and is part of a 3-bar bullish reversal pattern at support (the morning star reversal). From here\u2019s we\u2019re looking for a break above 7,392.50 to confirm a breakout, although we\u2019re also mindful that interim resistance awaits around 7,461.30 so this should be taken into account for from a reward/risk perspective.\n\nFTSE 100 - Top 20 YTD Performers\n\nWith that said, there\u2019ll still be some stocks within the index which may sustain a better breakout, so we\u2019ve listed the top 20 performers YTD (year to date) and selected three stocks worth following.\n\nJD Sports Fashion Daily Chart\n\nJD Sports (LON: ) sits just off record highs following yesterday\u2019s range expansion day. That the pullback failed to even test the 38.2% retracement is a testament to the trend\u2019s strength, and momentum has only increased since breaking out of its basing pattern on Sept. 10. The retracement took form of a small bullish flag which is a continuation pattern in an uptrend. Furthermore, as daily volumes remain above average and OBV is at fresh highs ahead of price are encouraging signs for a bullish breakout.\n\nBulls could take a break above 730 as a sign the trend is set to resume\n\nBias remains bullish whilst prices hold above the 653.2 breakout level, which could allows traders to buy dips above support if prices fail to break/hold higher\n\nAVEVA Group Daily Chart\n\nAVEVA Group (LON: ) is currently trading within a bearish channel, although there are signs that it could be building up for a break higher to resume its longer-term bullish trend. The September low found support at the April high around 3460, which is near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level and above the 200-day eMA.\n\nYesterday\u2019s 2-bar reversal marks a potential higher low, so a base could now be forming ahead of a bullish breakout. Volume was also above average yesterday which is an encouraging sign for a break higher.\n\nBulls could use a break above 3,800 to signal a bullish breakout from the corrective channel. However, we\u2019d prefer to see any breakout be accompanied on higher than average volume and / or OBV breaking a cycle high.\n\nBears could seek short setups if the channel caps as resistance on lower timeframes. The 3460 lows become the next target, although a break beneath here and the 200-day eMA suggests we\u2019re in for a deeper correction on the daily timeframe.\n\nSegro PLC Daily Chart\n\nSegro (LON: ) trades in a clearly defined uptrend and the moving average are within bullish sequence and all pointing higher, to show momentum across multiple timeframes is bullish. Yesterday the stock broke and closed to a new cycle high above 800. Moreover, OBV (on balance volume) broke higher ahead of the breakout to show bullish demand was picking up.\n\nThe trend remains bullish above 759.8, so bulls could seek to buy dips above this structural level and keep an open, bullish target\n\nIntraday traders could see of 800 holds as support to consider long positions\n\nThe bullish bias is invalidated with a break beneath the 759.8 low.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: USD/JPY, FTSE 100, Segro Plc, AVEVA Group PLC.
