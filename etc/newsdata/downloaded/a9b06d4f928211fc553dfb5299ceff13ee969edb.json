Permanently anchored off the Asian mainland, bristling with nuclear weapons, a nuclear Japan would make China\u2019s security situation much more complex than it is now, and force China to revise both its nuclear doctrine and increase its nuclear arsenal.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, Japan has no intention of building nuclear weapons. In fact, it has a strong aversion to nukes, having been the only country to actually be on the receiving end of a nuclear strike on its cities. Japan\u2019s strategic situation would have to grow very dire for it to undertake such a drastic and expensive option.\n\nAt the same time, China has no interest in provoking Japan into building them. China\u2019s nuclear \u201cno first use\u201d policy is in part aimed at reassuring Japan that, unless it were attacked first with nuclear weapons, it will not use them in wartime. Japan has no nukes, therefore, if China holds to its word, Japan should be reassured. \u201cIf\u201d and \u201cshould\u201d being the operative words here.\n\nStill, it\u2019s an interesting proposition. Nuclear phobias and the lack of a pressing need aside, there\u2019s certainly no reason why Japan,the third largest economy in the world, couldn\u2019t build nukes.\n\nWhat would a Japanese nuclear deterrent look like? Let\u2019s examine the traditional nuclear triad of land-based ballistic missiles, strategic bombers and ballistic missile submarines and each leg of the triad\u2019s suitability for Japan\u2019s circumstance. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say Japan can choose just one leg to invest in.\n\nWe\u2019ll also set the number of nukes at roughly 300. Japan\u2019s high population density would mean that the destruction of just a handful of cities could kill or injure the majority of the country\u2019s civilian population. Against an adversary such as Russia or China, Japan must be able to inflict similar losses.\n\nLand-based missiles:\n\nJapan could invest in a small arsenal of land-based missiles, each carrying one or more nuclear warheads. The missiles could be stationed in hardened silos, like the American Minuteman III, or on mobile launchers like the Russian RS-24 Yars. A Japanese ICBM would be smaller, not needing the range and fuel to reach North America. The ability to reach all of China, European Russia and the Middle East would be sufficient.\n\nEventually, Japan might settle on a force of 100 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, each equipped with three 100 kiloton warheads. The missiles could be based in hardened silos in eastern Hokkaido, Japan\u2019s northernmost island, or moved around on mobile launchers.\n\nThis is the least survivable of the three ideas. Japan\u2019s close proximity to China means that in the event of a nuclear attack from the latter it would need to have a \u201claunch on warning\u201d doctrine to ensure the missiles survived. That would considerably increase the possibility of accidental nuclear war, as a hardware or software malfunction in Japan\u2019s early warning system could be incorrectly interpreted as an attack.\n\nGeography makes land basing even less attractive. Japan\u2019s high population density makes it impossible to find a location for 100 missile silos that would not would invite terrible collateral damage in the event of attack. Even basing them in remote places like the northern Island of Hokkaido would incur needless risk. Mobile launchers would be far too large and heavy to travel Japan\u2019s road network, unless a separate track were built somewhere. Even that would make their positioning more predictable.\n\nAnother option might be to exploit Japan\u2019s extensive rail network.\n\nStrategic bombers\n\nJapan could build a wing of stealthy bombers to deliver cruise missiles and nuclear gravity bombs. Such an aircraft could fly nuclear penetration missions against adversaries, knocking out enemy nuclear weapons, command and control and other counterforce targets. Nuclear bombers would give Japanese strategic warfare planners the flexibility to go after multiple targets or change the targets in mid-flight. Nuclear bombers can be recalled at any point in the mission.\n\nA bomber scheme could involve three squadrons of twenty-four bombers each, for a total of seventy-two jets, each the size of an FB-111 strike aircraft. Each bomber would carry four short-range attack missiles, each with a 100 kiloton yield, for a total of 288 nuclear weapons.", "description": "A geopolitical earthquake.", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JKyw7BScLB8VdkBl0cOkbQ--~B/aD04ODU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/0906790a47b3a589dae4bf712a976a86", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
