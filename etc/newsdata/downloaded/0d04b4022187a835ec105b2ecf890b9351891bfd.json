In a statement carried on Saudi state television on Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said it had destroyed a warehouse that the rebels, known as the Houthis, used to house drones and missiles. The Houthis maintained it was a detention center. \u201cWitnessing this massive damage, seeing the bodies lying among the rubble was a real shock,\u201d said Franz Rauchenstein, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yemen. \u201cPeople who are not taking active part in combat should not die in such a way.\u201d According to the group, also known as the ICRC, the multistory building that served as a detention facility collapsed from the airstrike. It held around 170 detainees, and 40 of them were being treated for injuries. \u201cThe rest are presumed killed, though no toll has been confirmed,\u201d the ICRC said.\n\nThe coalition airstrike on the prison is reminiscent of the airstrike on the migrant detention center in Libya earlier this summer. Both showed the same callous disregard for the lives of civilians, and both slaughtered dozens as part of a failed military campaign. In Yemen, the U.S. continues to support and arm the governments that commit such senseless slaughters of civilians. In this case, people who were already victims of Houthi abuses were killed for no reason, and it was more likely than not a weapon made in the U.S. that killed them. When the U.S. arms the Saudi government, this is how these weapons are used.\n\nAs Gregg Carlstrom observed, this latest massacre was a microcosm of the war:\n\nA microcosm of the atrocity that is the war in Yemen. The Houthis turned a college into a prison where they torture their critics. The Saudi-led coalition bombed it yesterday and killed at least 100 people. https://t.co/8m5Srsqnak \u2014 Gregg Carlstrom (@glcarlstrom) September 2, 2019\n\nThe AP reported on the strike as well:\n\nResidents said, however, that people arrested over being critical of the Houthis had been imprisoned in the detention center. They said at least seven airstrikes had hit the area.\n\nThis is the reality that Yemeni civilians have been living with for more than four years: wrongfully detained and abused by the Houthis, and then blown up by the Saudis. As long as the war is allowed to drag on, more innocent Yemeni lives will be taken in atrocities such as this one.\n\nMeanwhile, the war becomes ever more absurd as the UAE bombs the Hadi government\u2019s forces in the south:\n\nOn Thursday, Emirati jets bombed convoys of government forces, killing scores in a series of airstrikes to prevent them from retaking Aden. The Emirati strikes spurred popular anger against the U.A.E. Activists began an online petition collecting signatures to \u201ckick Emiratis out of Yemen,\u201d and members of the Yemeni government issued a statement demanding the president to end the U.A.E. role in Yemen.\n\nThe ostensible goal of the coalition since 2015 has been to restore the \u201clegitimate\u201d government to power, but that hasn\u2019t been the UAE\u2019s real goal for a long time. Now one member of the coalition bombs the government that the rest of the coalition backs. When the U.S. arms the Emirati government, those weapons are now much more likely to be used against the forces of the Yemeni government that Washington claims to support. The events of the last few days have demonstrated once again that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be supporting or arming the Saudis or the UAE, and our government should instead be doing everything to pressure both of these states to end their military operations in Yemen.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yemen-bombing.png", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
