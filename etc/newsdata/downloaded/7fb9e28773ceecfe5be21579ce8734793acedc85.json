Russia\u2019s Nikita Nagornyy and Artur Dalaloyan claimed gold and silver, respectively, while China\u2019s two entrants finished fourth and fifth among the 24-man field.\n\nAD\n\nMikulak, 26, a California native who won eight NCAA titles at Michigan, finished seventh \u2014 more than a full point out of bronze, which was claimed by Ukraine\u2019s Oleg Verniaiev. Fellow American Yul Moldauer, a 23-year-old who competed at gymnastics powerhouse Oklahoma, was 16th. In both cases, it represented a step backward from their placements at last year\u2019s championships in Doha, where Mikulak was fifth and Moldauer 12th.\n\nAD\n\nWith the 2020 Tokyo Olympics roughly nine months away, the gap between the U.S. men\u2019s gymnasts and the sport\u2019s standard-bearers appears to be growing rather than narrowing.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly what the Americans had hoped, but it is the hard truth as countries they\u2019d love to supplant keep raising the sport\u2019s difficulty. And it stands in sharp contrast to the U.S. women, who dominate the globe, led by five-time world all-around champion Simone Biles.\n\nAD\n\nThe performance deficit of U.S. men\u2019s gymnastics relative to the current world powers has several root factors, few of which can be remedied in the months remaining before Tokyo\u2019s Opening Ceremony.\n\nThe gap has been years in the making \u2014 both between the U.S. men and the U.S. women, and between the U.S. men and Russian and Chinese men, in particular.\n\nSince 2003, the U.S. women have won 19 medals in the world all-around competition: 10 golds (five claimed by Biles), six silvers and three bronze.\n\nAD\n\nIn the same time frame, American men have won two world all-around medals: Paul Hamm\u2019s gold in 2003, and Jonathan Horton\u2019s bronze in 2010.\n\nThree-time Olympic medalist Fabian Hambuchen of Germany, 31, who\u2019s still regarded as a maestro on the horizontal bar despite retiring after the 2016 Rio Games, notes that the chief gap between the U.S. men and the world\u2019s gymnastics powers is the difficulty of their skills.\n\nAD\n\nGymnastics scores reflect two components: one for difficulty (the D score); another for execution (the E score). The strategy for tallying the highest score typically boils down to a question of risk versus reward. A more difficult routine earns a higher D score, yet it\u2019s apt to incur deductions on the E score for any aspect of the execution that\u2019s less than perfect.\n\nIn Hambuchen\u2019s analysis, the U.S. men traditionally emphasize execution \u2014 doing what they do as well as they can \u2014 rather than stretch their limits and risk a sloppy performance.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an emphasis Hambuchen appreciates and admires \u2014 to a point.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. guys, they have a really good execution,\u201d said Hambuchen, who is serving as an analyst for German television. \u201cThey have a huge focus on that, especially when they\u2019re still in college. They\u2019re always trying to not do the highest D score they can; they try to be consistent and clean.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c. . . I am completely with the Americans on this point. But still, this is not college. This is world championships, so you need to raise your D score. The other teams are increasing their D score and just getting higher [marks].\u201d\n\nHorton, 33, who retired after the 2012 Olympics, watched Friday\u2019s competition via his home laptop and remarked on the medalists\u2019 staggering level of difficulty and style, which he characterized on social media as \u201coff the charts\u201d and the \u201cmost beautifully executed gymnastics of all time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHorton credited Japan\u2019s Kohei Uchimura, who counts six world all-around championships among his 21 world medals, along with two Olympic all-around golds, with proving that extremely difficult gymnastics can be done without sacrificing execution.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the current crop of Americans, Horton notes, only Mikulak comes close to the skill that the Russians and Chinese are showing in competition. In Friday\u2019s all-around, Mikulak\u2019s parallel bars routine had a D score of 6.400, the same as that of the gold and silver medalists, while his horizontal bar\u2019s D score (6.100) exceeded those of all three medalists.\n\nBut Mikulak has struggled, and did again Friday, to stage complete, medal-worthy performances across all six mandatory events in all-around competitions on the world stage.\n\nAgainst an all-American field at the U.S. championships, it has been a snap. Mikulak has won six of the past seven U.S. all-around titles, which speaks, in a sense, to the drop-off in skill behind him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. men\u2019s coach Mark Williams acknowledged Friday that Mikulak would benefit from being pushed more by domestic rivals. But there simply isn\u2019t a pool deep enough to do that.\n\nU.S. gymnasts such as Moldauer are plenty talented and capable of performing quality routines. But even if flawless, they can\u2019t score enough to challenge the world\u2019s best because their skills aren\u2019t difficult enough.\n\nHorton views this as \u201ca generational thing\u201d that he hopes and believes can be remedied by the 2024 Olympics, if the promising crop of juniors develops.\n\nStill, U.S. men\u2019s gymnastics faces deep-seated, systemic cultural challenges in closing the gap on Russia and China. It simply isn\u2019t as popular with boys in America as it is in Asia and throughout Europe.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI did gymnastics 28 years and quickly knew that gymnastics in the United States is not a premier sport,\u201d said Horton, a Houston native. \u201cIt is for women, but not for men. We don\u2019t get the best athletes; the best athletes in the U.S. go to play football, basketball and baseball.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one of the premier sports in China and Japan. In Russia, it\u2019s huge. They have such a higher level of respect for gymnastics, so they\u2019re getting the best athletes they can find.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "While women continue to dominate behind Simone Biles, American men are not executing difficult enough routines to compete.", "authors": ["Liz Clarke", "Sports Reporter Focusing On Tennis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LZTvT2AeiDbFVOq7NktUkm0FHwA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DA26KHMPAI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
