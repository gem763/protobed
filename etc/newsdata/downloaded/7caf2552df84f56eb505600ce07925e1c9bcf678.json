I\u2019m going to learn a lot from this match,\u201d a tearful Gauff said after the 6-3 6-0 defeat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the number one player in the world right now, so I know what I need to do to get to that level.\n\n\u201cAfter the match, I think she just proved that she\u2019s a true athlete. For me, the definition of an athlete is someone who on the court treats you like your worst enemy but off the court can be your best friend.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what she did tonight,\u201d added Gauff, who trained at the same Florida tennis centre as Osaka when they were younger.\n\nOsaka said she had the idea to invite Gauff into the interview when they were shaking hands at the net.\n\n\u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t see is that we go into the locker room and just cry and do press after,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be nice if she addressed the people who came and obviously cheered so hard for her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had an incredible week so I thought I\u2019d just make a positive statement out of it.\u201d\n\nWhile she was full of compassion after the match Osaka was all business on the court, avoiding Gauff\u2019s dangerous backhand and taking advantage of her shaky serving on a warm night in Flushing Meadows.\n\nOsaka predicted Gauff would become a threat to the game\u2019s top players when she builds some more power.\n\nGauff took the tennis world by storm at Wimbledon this year where she reached the fourth round and was given a wildcard to play at Flushing Meadows.\n\nAfter a memorable battle in the second round with Tina Babos on Thursday Gauff was unable to make much inroads against Osaka\u2019s powerful serve, converting two of five break point opportunities and issuing seven double faults.\n\nGauff\u2019s U.S. Open is not quite over, as she will team up with Catherine McNally to take on Kveta Peschke and Nicole Melichar in the second round of the women\u2019s doubles on Sunday.\n\nFor Osaka, a meeting with 13th seed Belinda Bencic awaits.", "description": "Coco Gauff's U.S. Open came to an abrupt end under the bright lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium on Saturday but the 15-year-old said she would leave New York a better player after falling to world number one Naomi Osaka.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425003110&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801CC-OZASP"}
