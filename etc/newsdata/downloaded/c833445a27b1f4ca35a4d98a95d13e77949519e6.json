We literally just got done with telling people to not eat Tide Pods, and now it\u2019s apparently ~cool~ and ~good~ to serve booze in them.\n\nThe little pouches of liquid have sent the booze-loving community into a bit of a tizzy, which is fair enough because they are, and I must stress this, fucking absurd.\n\nThe capsules themselves are made from seaweed (with the saltiness of seaweed removed) and come in 23ml serves, which is just under a standard dram of whisky you\u2019d cop in a bar.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by The Glenlivet (@theglenlivet) on Oct 3, 2019 at 9:49am PDT\n\nI have to give it to \u2019em, it\u2019s a pretty genius way of trying to cut down on waste going back to landfill, even if a glass whisky bottle is pretty much entirely recyclable.\n\nWhat gets me though is that the little Glenlivet pods mean you have to pop them in your mouth in one go, essentially blowing your head off with basically an entire finger of scotch in one hit.\n\nYou usually sip at a glass of scotch or a cocktail over a period of time, savouring the flavours and notes, huffing in the vapours, and really letting that liquid delight roll around your mouth, right?\n\nNot with these little bursts of booze. Instead, you chuck one in your gob, bite down, and let the whole near-shot of a Glenlivet scotch cocktail smack you sideways into next Tuesday.\n\nThey come in three different varieties at the moment (Citrus, Wood, and Spice) and are only available at London bar Tay\u0113r + Elementary, as part of London Cocktail Week. I\u2019m still genuinely very conflicted over whether I love or hate them.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely sent the wider scotch-appreciating community into a bit of a spin though. A bunch of them are traditionalists and prefer to keep their scotch on ice or neat, in a glass, while others find it practically blasphemous that you\u2019d use a single-malt scotch in a cocktail.\n\nOh and that people are 100% going to put the Glenlivet pods in their anoos and/or vajoot.\n\nGuys I don\u2019t know how to tell you this. Teens are gonna put these in their butts. \u2014 Sarah York ????
