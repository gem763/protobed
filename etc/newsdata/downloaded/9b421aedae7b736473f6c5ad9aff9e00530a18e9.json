As the game director for Blizzard\u2019s colorful team-based shooter Overwatch, Kaplan\u2019s fascination with the device naturally turned a bit more serious: he wondered what his own game would be like on the handheld console.\n\n\u201cLiterally the day the Switch came out, we were thinking about it,\u201d Kaplan tells The Verge. \u201cI remember immediately talking to people around the office saying, \u2018What would it take for us to be here?\u2019\u201d It took some time for that to happen. Blizzard started by porting Diablo III to the Switch late last year, and work on a portable version of Overwatch started a little over a year ago. The final version will be launching on Nintendo\u2019s tablet on October 15th.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure to do it right.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kaplan, the constantly changing nature of Overwatch made it a bit trickier to port, compared to the hack-and-slash RPG. \u201cIt was much easier to get Diablo on the device than it was to get Overwatch,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, like everything we do here, we wanted to make sure to do it right. It was just a long process of figuring out how to handle the development in a way that we felt like we would be very proud of the end product.\u201d\n\nAs with Diablo III on the Switch, Blizzard worked with developer Iron Galaxy Studios on the port, and according to producer Wes Yanagi, \u201cthe bulk of our efforts on the Switch were a lot of heavy optimization.\u201d For the most part, the new version of Overwatch will be the same as on other platforms, though it will run at 30 frames per second (both docked and undocked), compared to 60 fps on PS4 and Xbox One. But it also comes with some new features, including gyro-controlled aiming and the ability to navigate menus via the touchscreen. And, of course, there\u2019s the biggest bonus of all: portability.\n\nThe fact that the Switch is relatively underpowered means that it might not look as good as on other platforms. But those technical limitations shouldn\u2019t impact updates. \u201cOur goal is to keep all platforms in parity,\u201d says Yanagi. \u201cSo as far as we can, we\u2019re going to have all the same feature sets. Any kind of new heroes or events or anything like that should be out at the same time.\u201d Kaplan adds, \u201cNone of our platforms are considered lesser to us.\u201d\n\nSwitch Shooters It may not have the ideal control scheme or the most robust online service, but the Nintendo Switch is steadily becoming a solid place for online shooters. Nintendo\u2019s own Splatoon 2 is a platform highlight, and Epic has seen success with a Switch version of Fortnite. In fact, Kaplan says that Fortnite\u2019s expansion onto mobile was a welcome sign while the team at Blizzard was porting Overwatch. \u201cThat was very promising for us when we saw Fortnite,\u201d he says, \u201cand also just how good of a version of Fortnite it was on the Switch, and how much players loved playing it there.\u201d\n\nOne of the elements that\u2019s helped Overwatch stand out is its style and tone. As opposed to most multiplayer shooters, which are dark and gritty, Overwatch is bright and colorful, with a diverse, eccentric cast of characters to choose from. It\u2019s this same sensibility that Kaplan believes makes the game a good fit for Nintendo\u2019s portable console.\n\n\u201cNintendo games are typically very bright, very saturated, very hopeful; less realistic, more character-based,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen you think of the Nintendo ecosystem and the types of games that are really popular, we felt like there\u2019d be a one-to-one match with Nintendo players being attracted to Overwatch because of the aesthetic and the feel and the spirit of the game. It all felt like a great match to us.\u201d Additionally, Kaplan thinks the Switch version won\u2019t just catch on with brand-new players, but longtime ones, too. \u201cI think, in addition to that audience, there\u2019s another audience, which is the dedicated Overwatch fans who play on multiple platforms,\u201d he says.\n\nFor that latter group, in particular, Overwatch will be missing a key feature when it launches on the Switch: any form of cross-save or cross-progression. That\u2019s part of what has made Fortnite such a large, multiplatform success. The items you unlock in Epic\u2019s battle royale hit, either by earning or buying them, carry over from one device to the next, whether you\u2019re playing on your phone, PC, or console.\n\nUnfortunately, right now, there are no solid details about if or when that might be coming to Overwatch. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be super exciting to have that,\u201d Yanagi says of cross-progression. \u201cA lot of people are asking for it, and it\u2019s something that, as a player, I totally want to be able to do that. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re currently investigating, but we don\u2019t have any solid info right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of our platforms are considered lesser to us.\u201d\n\n2019 is shaping up to be a big year for Blizzard\u2019s shooter. The developer has introduced two new heroes to the game \u2014 Baptiste and Sigma \u2014 along with a creative Workshop mode and \u201crole queue\u201d feature so players can better focus on specific in-game team compositions. At the same time, the fledgling Overwatch League just wrapped its second season. It\u2019s clearly a very busy time for the three-year-old game, one that will only get more hectic when the Switch version debuts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely thrilling,\u201d Kaplan says of launching on the Switch. \u201cWe\u2019re a group of craftspeople. We like building stuff. But that\u2019s not rewarding in and of itself unless somebody enjoys it and wants to play it. And we\u2019re so lucky that three years after the initial launch of the game, we\u2019re going to get to welcome a whole new audience.\u201d", "description": "Blizzard\u2019s online team shooter Overwatch comes to the Nintendo Switch on October 15th, and game director Jeff Kaplan say it\u2019s a port the developer has been thinking of for some time.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2LLVpYHtcWrfxDRAtFecqOSu1M=/0x25:1255x682/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19254586/nintendo_switch_overwatch_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
