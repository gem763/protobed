Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 is being groomed to run as a third-party candidate to boost President Trump\u2019s reelection chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary, and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told former Obama adviser David Plouffe on the \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Ms. Stein, the 2016 Green Party presidential candidate. \u201cShe\u2019s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset \u2014 I mean, totally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be but I will guarantee they\u2019ll have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Gabbard has previously said she will not launch a third-party presidential bid if she doesn\u2019t win the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn Friday, the Hawaii Democrat hit back at Mrs. Clinton, calling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nMs. Gabbard said there\u2019s been a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to destroy her reputation since she entered the race.\n\n\u201cNow we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and\u2026powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s debate, the congresswoman also pushed back against the notion that she\u2019s a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I\u2019m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said. \u201cThis morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
