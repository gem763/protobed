The ability to transfer other rewards currencies like Amex Membership Rewards points and Chase Ultimate Rewards points to airline and hotel partners is what makes them so valuable, so this was a huge step toward making Capital One miles more flexible, and more useful.\n\nCapital One miles transfer to 15 airline programs, including Air Canada Aeroplan, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer, and Qantas Frequent Flyer. Most transfers are at a ratio of 2 Capital One miles to 1.5 airline miles, though a few partners have a lower 2:1 ratio.\n\nCapital One Qantas transfer bonus details\n\nOccasionally, Capital One (along with other credit card issuers) runs transfer bonuses that give cardholders extra airline miles when they move over rewards to a specific frequent flyer program. Currently, it's offering one such bonus for transfers to Australian airline Qantas' loyalty program.\n\nUntil October 31, when you transfer Capital One miles to Qantas, you'll receive a 33.3% bonus. This means that during the bonus period, the transfer rate for Qantas will effectively be 1:1. After the bonus ends, the transfer rate will go back to 2:1.5.\n\nQantas' Frequent Flyer program isn't known for offering especially generous mileage rates, but if you have a lot of Capital One miles and are eyeing a trip to Australia, this transfer bonus will certainly stretch your rewards further. Plus, you can also transfer Amex and Citi points to Qantas, so if you come up short with Capital One miles but have points from a card like the Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express or the Citi Prestige\u00ae Card, you could make up the difference.\n\nHow to earn Capital One miles\n\nYou can earn Capital One miles with four credit cards:\n\nMore credit card coverage", "description": "Until October 31, you can get a 33.3% mileage bonus when you transfer Capital One miles to the Qantas frequent flyer program.", "authors": ["Sarah Silbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c2d1ab5bd77302f1c6caf66-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
