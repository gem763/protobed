REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe central bank has already lowered borrowing costs twice this year, with a drawn out U.S.-China trade war taking a toll on the domestic economy and raising fears of a slowdown.\n\nOdds of a rate cut have ballooned to over 97% from about 40% a month earlier. Hopes of a rate cut and optimism around trade talks have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to record highs in the last two sessions.\n\nNearly half of the S&P 500 companies have posted quarterly results so far, of which 77.1% have beaten profit estimates. Still, analysts are expecting a 1.9% drop in third-quarter earnings, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nGeneral Electric Co (GE.N) gained 5.2% in premarket trading after the industrial conglomerate beat quarterly profit estimates and raised its cash forecast for the year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) dropped 1.3% after the chipmaker forecast fourth-quarter sales below expectations.\n\nBefore the Fed\u2019s policy decision, a Commerce Department\u2019s gross domestic product report is likely to indicate that the U.S. economy is losing speed, but not tipping into recession.\n\nThe data, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is likely to show U.S. economy slowed to 1.6% in the third quarter from 2% in the April-June period.\n\nAt 7:15 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 remained unchanged. S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 0.75 points, or 0.02% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 7.75 points, or 0.1%.\n\nAmong other stocks, Mattel Inc (MAT.O) surged nearly 20% after the toymaker reported a surprise jump in quarterly revenue on higher demand for newer models of its flagship Barbie brand and dolls based on Korean pop-sensation BTS.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) rose 2.8% as the company said 15 new tests found no asbestos in a bottle of baby powder that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says tested positive for trace amounts of asbestos. FDA said it stands by its finding.", "description": "U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Wednesday as investors digested a fresh batch of earnings reports ahead of a widely expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later in the day.", "authors": ["Arjun Panchadar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446510542&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0V2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
