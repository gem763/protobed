Over half of earnings made by FTSE 100 companies are recorded in dollar, so a weak pound makes sterling-denominated share prices look more attractive.\n\nBanking stocks rallied as investors reasoned that a hard Brexit was now less likely after the weekend\u2019s events in parliament. A hard Brexit is seen as damaging to the UK economy and therefore banks, who would likely suffer higher defaults on loans and mortgages if the economy suffered.\n\nBoris Johnson withdrew a vote on his Brexit deal in parliament on Saturday after MPs outflanked the Prime Minister, forcing him to write to the EU asking for an extension to the timetable. Johnson has vowed to bring his deal back to parliament for a vote this week.\n\nMichael Hewson, the chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, said in an email that the UK \u201cwill probably get a short [extension] if deal passed, a longer one if not.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Pound down as UK parliament in turmoil over Brexit deal\n\nThe \u201cdeal still looks like it may be passed and that means potential for further upside,\u201d Hewson wrote to Yahoo Finance UK. \u201cMarket [are] taking the optimistic view.\u201d\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), which is solely domestic focused, saw shares rally 2.1% at the open on Monday.

Centrica (CNA.L), which owns British Gas, rose by 2.6%, house builder Taylor Wimpey\u2019s (TW.L) stock price jumped by 2.7%, and Aviva (AV.L), the multi-national insurance company that makes around half its profit in the UK, was up by 2%.\n\nThe FTSE 250 (^FTMC) initially opened in the red by was up by 0.3% after around 30 minutes of trading.
