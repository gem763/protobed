The prime minister could get his \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his new Brexit deal. Or clever lawmakers could outflank him and pass an amendment requring more scrutiny of the pact\u2019s detail \u2014 and force Johnson to ask the Europeans for another delay, beyond the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson began his remarks by thanking lawmakers for gathering on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years, the first time in a generation.\n\nAD\n\nHe spoke about the toll of the Brexit debate. Since Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, he said, \u201cfriendships have been strained, families divided, and the attention of this house consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.\u201d\n\nJohnson said: \u201cBut I hope, Mr. Speaker, that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution.\u201d The prime minister called his deal \u201ca new and better way forward\u201d for Britain and Europe.\n\nThe British leader needs to win 320 votes in Parliament to pass his Brexit deal. Number crunchers on Saturday morning said it was too tight to call, but could see pathways for him to win the support he needs.\n\nAD\n\nIn one of his last outings as Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, once played a starring role in the Brexit drama, selecting which amendments can be voted on.\n\nAD\n\nOne such amendment could see Johnson being forced to ask Europe for a Brexit delay, regardless of whether he has support for his deal.\n\nThat amendment, from the Tory rebel Oliver Letwin, is designed to box Johnson in \u2014 so he cannot force Britain to leave the European Union until the British lawmakers have scrutinized and passed all necessary legislation for an orderly exit.\n\nAnalysts have called it \u201ccunningly crafted.\u201d It won\u2019t stop Brexit \u2014 it is not really intended to. But it could slow it down and might have broad support from those who don\u2019t completely trust the new prime minister. Johnson\u2019s allies have branded the amendment another sneaky attempt by an obstreperous Parliament to defy the will of the people and gum up the Brexit trajectory.\n\nUnderscoring how the country remains deeply divided on Brexit, thousands of protesters began spilling into London from across the county to demand a second referendum. For more than a year, polls have shown that if there were a countrywide \u201cdo over vote,\u201d Britons would, by a narrow margin, opt to stay in the E.U.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolling firm YouGov reported that 30 percent of Britons favour Johnson\u2019s deal, 17 percent want to get out without a deal to manage the transition and 38 percent want to remain remain in the E.U., with the final 15 percent unsure.\n\nJohnson was having none of that and was pressing lawmakers to get Britain out by the end of October, as he has promised many times, \u201cdo or die.\u201d\n\nOn the floor of the chamber, Johnson said Britain has long had a divided heart over Europe. It is skeptical, dubious and half-hearted about Europe\u2019s grand projects, for further integration, for more federalism on the continent, for a Europe-wide defense pact, for a unified economic policy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are skeptical about European integration,\u201d he said, \u201cBut passionate about Europe.\u201d\n\nJohnson warned those who sought an extenion: \u201cWe must abandon the delusion that this House can delay Brexit again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe prime minister said there\u2019s \u201cno appetite\u201d in Brussels for more delay.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said lawmakers should reject Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\n\u201cI also totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cBut we simply can\u2019t vote for a deal that is even worse than the one the House voted to reject three times.\u201d\n\nOne challenge for the prime minister: there has been scant time to scrutinize the Brexit deal Johnson struck with the E.U., which could be to his liking.\n\nAD\n\nEven some friendly lawmakers who support Brexit have complained they want to read the government\u2019s own economic analysis of the cost of Johnson\u2019s deal before they vote on it.\n\n\u201cHis strategy has been the same as Theresa May\u2019s strategy,\u201d said Simon Usherwood, a professor of politics at the University of Surrey. \u201cPresent a deal, and then bounce, bounce, bounce it straight through. Before you know it, you\u2019ve agreed something, and don\u2019t worry about the details.\u201d\n\nMay presented her withdrawal agreement to Parliament three times \u2014 and three times she was rejected.\n\nAD\n\nBut Johnson could have another factor working in his favor: \u201cBrexhaustion.\u201d In a sign of the times, Sky News on Friday launched its own completely Brexit-free news channel, hoping there is a market for people who want a break from Brexit but not the news.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s new Brexit deal offers a more distant relationship with the E.U. than the agreement struck by his predecessor. However, his plan would see Northern Ireland stay largely aligned to the E.U., even though it would leave the block with the rest of the U.K.\n\nThe Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party said the deal was not in the province\u2019s \u201clong-term interests.\u201d Its 10 lawmakers are expected to vote against the deal on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt was once said that no British prime minister could ever agree to such terms,\u201d DUP lawmaker Nigel Dodds said in Parliament. \u201cWill he now abide by that and reconsider the fact that we must leave as one nation together?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohn Major and Tony Blair said in videos published for the People\u2019s Vote campaign that Johnson\u2019s deal risked derailing peace in Northern Ireland. The two former prime ministers, who both backed \u201cremain\u201d in the E.U. referendum, played important roles in the Good Friday Agreement, the accord that helped to usher in peace in Northern Ireland after decades of sectarian violence.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame and an outrage frankly that Northern Ireland is treated like some disposable inconvenience to be bartered away,\u201d said Blair.\n\nOver the past 48 hours, there has been much wheeling and dealing and arm twisting. It\u2019s hard to know what methods of persuasion, if any, were used in hopes of winning support. There was speculation that Johnson could offer the 21 lawmakers he expelled from his party last month a way back in if they voted to support his deal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also offered new pledges on Friday night to protect workers\u2019 rights, which was seen as an attempt to woo more Labour lawmakers, especially those who are either Brexiteers or who represent Brexit-backing constituencies.\n\nLabour\u2019s Corbyn called those pledges \u201cempty promises.\u201d\n\nThis deal, Corbyn said, would \u201cabsolutely inevitably lead to a Trump trade deal, forcing the U.K. to diverge from the highest standards and expose our families once again to chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.\u201d\n\nIn an opinion piece in the Guardian newspaper, Melanie Onn, a Labour lawmaker from Grimsby, a pro-Brexit town populated by \u201cLabour-leavers,\u201d implored her colleagues \u201cto use this unique chance to help us move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk of letting this final shot at a deal slip through our fingers is too great,\u201d she wrote, in a piece authored with a Conservative Party lawmaker.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson is also hoping to bring on side the 28 hard line Brexiteers from his party who have previously been resistant to a Brexit deal. That group said Saturday morning that it had advised its members to vote for Johnson\u2019s agreement.", "description": "Getting out has been an agonizing process that has consumed and divided the U.K.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tEiodTU_ESbPedW5ZrYDbh-Tw-8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OMSDOIXSLYI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
