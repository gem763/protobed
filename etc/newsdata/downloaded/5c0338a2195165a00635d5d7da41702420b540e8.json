In response, Trump posted a tweet claiming to support reform and attacked Legend for not backing his plan last year. Then, the president took a shot at the EGOT winner\u2019s wife, Teigen, but without using her name:\n\n....musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n.....the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it...And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t lost on Teigen that Trump tagged Legend in his tweet, but not her. And she let him have it:\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nLuna, remember the night before your first day of school? When mommy was making your sign and the pussy ass bitch president had his 9th meltdown of the day pic.twitter.com/ZFZHJYrDPG \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch pic.twitter.com/9ZkV7bh4FA \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nMinutes later, Legend also fired back:\n\nImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody--ANYBODY--will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nYour country needs you, Melania \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nTeigen has been a constant critic of Trump and his policies, to the point of being blocked by him on Twitter.\n\nTeigen and Legend began trending almost immediately after Trump\u2019s attack. But the couple tried to get another term trending instead:\n\nLove HuffPost?
