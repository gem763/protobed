He said it wasn\u2019t clear that Grisham\u2019s letter about Acosta applied at events others than formal press conferences \u2014 nor was it evident how one would apply the vague principles Grisham touted.\n\n\u201c\u2019White House events\u2019 appear to vary greatly in character. Thus, without any contextual guideposts, \u2018professionalism,\u2019 standing alone, remains too murky to provide fair notice here,\u201d Contreras wrote in a 24-page opinion. \u201cWhat is deemed \u2018professional\u2019 behavior in the context of a state dinner may be very different from what is considered \u2018professional\u2019 behavior during a performance by James Brown.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Mr. Karem\u2019s conduct, including threatening to escalate a verbal confrontation into a physical one to the point that a Secret Service agent intervened, clearly breached well-understood norms of professional conduct. The Press Secretary must have the ability to deter such unacceptable conduct.\u201c\n\nContreras noted that the event \u2014 presidential remarks to a group of attendees at summit of social media influencers supportive of President Donald Trump \u2014 was hardly a solemn one at which Karem\u2019s behavior was wildly outside the norm.\n\n\u201cThis event was also one where jocular insults had been flying from all directions,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThere is no indication in the record that other offenders were reprimanded, or even told to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking into account all of the evidence in the present record, the Court cannot conclude that Karem\u2019s behavior was clearly proscribed by the Acosta Letter\u2019s standard, or even by any widely understood standard of \u2018professionalism\u2019 or \u2018decorum\u2019 within the context of such an unruly event,\u201d the judge added.\n\nThe judge stressed that his ruling is not a final one on Karem\u2019s suit and that while his credential will be restored for now, it is possible the 30-day suspension could be upheld in the future.\n\nAt the Rose Garden event in July, Karem and Gorka traded insults, which were caught on video and quickly went viral. Karem was heard saying, \u201cThis is a group of people who are eager for demonic possession.\u201d In turn, Gorka was heard saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not a journalist \u2014 you\u2019re a punk!\u201d\n\n", "description": "The judge says the standards for conduct at the event were not clear.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6b/0b/53c44fe9412cbd395e32d8861b24/20190903-brian-karem-gty-773.jpg"}
