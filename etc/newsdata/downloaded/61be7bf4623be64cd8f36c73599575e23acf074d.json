(AP) - Orange, yellow, white and purple carrots of all shapes and sizes were harvested this week as part of a research trial to test carrots\u2019 genetic resistance to disease.\n\nThe Skagit Valley Herald reports plant pathologist Lindsey du Toit said 220 breeding lines of carrots were planted in a research plot this summer at the Washington State University Mount Vernon Research Center.\n\nShe said the goal is to find varieties with the best nutrition and flavor, and that are genetically resistant to disease.\n\nVolunteers helped harvest the carrots and sort them based on the severity of fungus growing on them. The fungus was added to the soil earlier in the growing season to expose the carrots to disease.\n\nShe said the research could help organic carrot growers in Skagit County.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Skagit Valley Herald, http://www.skagitvalleyherald.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Orange, yellow, white and purple carrots of all shapes and sizes were harvested this week as part of a research trial to test carrots' genetic resistance to disease.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
