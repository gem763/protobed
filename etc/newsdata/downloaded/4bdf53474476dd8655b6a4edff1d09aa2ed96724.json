My husband and I had had some casual, preliminary conversations about growing vegetables this summer, but we hadn\u2019t made an official plan when I came home with half a dozen seedlings and no idea what I was doing with them.\n\nAs city dwellers, we don\u2019t have a backyard. We have a roof deck and a bricked-in courtyard out back. I snuggled a few of the seedlings in with a lemon-basil plant, then purchased bags of soil and pots. I put the soil in the pots, put the plants in the soil, put the pots on the roof and hoped for the best. As the family\u2019s early riser, my husband agreed to do the watering, prompting me to quote my favorite Onion headline: \u201cHaving a Gardener Is a Wonderful Hobby.\u201d He was skeptical. I talked a good game, but in truth, I wasn\u2019t optimistic, either.\n\nBut the tomato plants began to grow, going from six-inch-high delicate collections of leaves to vigorous, bushy, knee-high plants. And then, one morning my husband reported that he\u2019d seen tiny tomatoes, a cluster of eight. I went outside, and there they were, the largest ones the size of gumballs, the smallest ones no bigger than peas. We were so thrilled, you would have thought we\u2019d won the lottery.", "description": "Who knew how much emotion could be invested in a tiny urban garden?", "authors": ["Jennifer Weiner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/opinion/28weiner1/28weiner1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
