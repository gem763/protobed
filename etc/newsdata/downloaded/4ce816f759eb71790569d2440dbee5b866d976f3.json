Her mother, who lives in Portage la Prairie, went to pick Taylor up at the hospital's urgent care department, but Taylor refused to return home with her.\n\n\"[Hospital] staff said, 'well, she's an adult, she can do what she wants,'\" Darseen Pryor, Taylor's mother, told CBC News earlier this week. \"So she left on foot and I followed in the vehicle \u2026 until she scaled the fence on Pembina Highway into the [University of Manitoba].\"\n\nTaylor disappeared into the trees and field of the former Southwood golf course, her mother said.\n\nThe family organized a search for the 21-year-old, who they said had been struggling with depression and anxiety, which continued through Friday and into Saturday morning.\n\nLate Saturday morning, a heavy police presence was seen in an area just off Pembina Highway, between Markham Road and Southpark Drive, but police have not confirmed whether that was connected with the discovery of Taylor's body.\n\nPolice confirmed in a news release Saturday afternoon that Taylor's body had been found. They said they do not suspect foul play in her death, but did not release any other details.", "description": "Police say the body of Taylor Pryor, 21, has been found.
