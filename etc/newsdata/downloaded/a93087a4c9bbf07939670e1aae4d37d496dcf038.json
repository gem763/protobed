But, as we\u2019ve seen, the tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides \u2014 including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,\u201d said Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cBy making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies,\u201d Mr. Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Democratic caucus, said in a statement.\n\nThe ACCESS Act current has co-sponsors on each side of the aisle \u2014 Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat \u2014 giving it bipartisan backing from the start amid social media companies facing scrutiny on Capitol Hill from all angles.\n\n\u201cYour data is your property. Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry,\u201d Mr. Hawley said.\n\nMr. Blumenthal agreed.\n\n\u201cThe bipartisan ACCESS Act would empower consumers to finally stand up to Big Tech and move their data to services that respect their rights,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill was introduced the same day it was announced that attorneys general for 47 states and U.S. territories will participate in an antitrust probe of Facebook being led by New York state\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\n\u201cAs we continue our investigation, we will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook\u2019s actions stifled competition and put users at risk,\u201d said New York State Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nMore recently, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, was met with related concerns while appearing Wednesday in front of House Financial Services Committee during a hearing held mainly about his company plans to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra.\n\n\u201cYou have opened up a serious discussion about whether Facebook should be broken up,\u201d Rep. Maxine Waters, California Democrat and the chairwoman of the committee, told Mr. Zuckerberg during the hearing.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg, 35, has previously rejected calls to regulate Facebook, which currently boasts more than 2 billion daily active users between its several apps and services.\n\n\u201cI understand the concerns that people have about how tech platforms have centralized power,\u201d he said at an event last week at Georgetown University. \u201cBut I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
