Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.\n\nFacebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying \u201ca range of publishers for access to all of their content.\u201d\n\nDuring a discussion between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and News Corp.\u2019s Robert Thomson at the Paley Media Center in New York, Zuckerberg said there\u2019s not \u201cany kind of one\u201d metric guiding how Facebook will pay the publishers. (News Corp. is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who also owns FOX Business).\n\n\u201cBut in general, we value things like the amount of content that people are producing that is high quality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scale of the number of people who are basically subscribers or readers of that content.\u201d\n\nNews executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories \u2014 mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The company unveiled the \u201cNews Tab,\u201d a separate section in Facebook\u2019s main app that\u2019s dedicated entirely to sharing headlines.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/Mark-Zuckerberg-Reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
