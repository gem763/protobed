That weighed on stocks like Lam Research Corp., which fell 5.3%, and KLA Corp., down 2.1%.\n\nBut the sector has still outperformed this year. Even with Friday's drop, Micron is up 36% since the start of 2019, while Lam Research has climbed 69% and KLA is up 77%. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor exchange-traded fund has gained 34%, handily beating the 18% rise in the S&P 500 over that period.\n\nSemiconductors are a famously cyclical industry, driven by fluctuating demand for the chips used in everything from computers to iPhones and smartwatches. That cycle is at a low point: Global semiconductor sales fell 16% in July from a year ago, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. But many analysts expect a rebound.\n\n\"We are optimistic around 2020,\" Wedbush said in a research note Friday, projecting that demand for memory chips would pick up next year with growing adoption of new 5G smartphones and the rollout of new gaming consoles.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war caused volatile trading in recent months in chip maker stocks, which often have complex supply chains extending to China. High-level trade talks are set to resume next month, which has fueled some optimism that a resolution could be near.\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 16:53 ET (20:53 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
