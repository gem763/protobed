It looks like it could all happen a lot quicker than that.\n\nHis company has been fired as manager of the flagship Woodford Equity Income Fund. It faces the same fate at Woodford Patient Capital Trust, his other main vehicle. Mr Woodford, once the UK\u2019s most formidable stock picker, looks finished as a force in retail funds.\n\nThe structure he devised has been his downfall. The EIF, characterised by this column as a \u201cdoom loop\u201d before its suspension in June, piled risk upon risk. The open-ended fund, worth \u00a310.2 billion ($19.3 billion) at peak, offered daily redemption and specialised in \u201cconviction\u201d stakes in blue chips and illiquid stocks.\n\nWhen Mr Woodford\u2019s muddled bets serially failed, retail investors lured by fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown stampeded for the exit. Short sellers, positioned like hungry bears on a salmon river, exploited their opportunity.\n\nNo other fund manager of Mr Woodford\u2019s calibre can boast of being sacked with the backing, however indirectly, of Andrew Bailey, boss of the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nLink Services, the business with the previously low-profile role of authorised corporate director of the EIF, consulted closely with the FCA on its plan to ditch Woodford Investment Management. Neither of them, it appears, told Mr Woodford until the last moment.", "description": "The former manager of Woodford Equity Income Fund could easily reinvent himself, running family and client money privately.
