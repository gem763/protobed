(Okay, scratch the \u201cremembers and loves\u201d part.) \u201cI don\u2019t know what their inspiration was,\u201d Big Mouth\u2019s resident composer, Mark Rivers, told Vulture. \u201cI didn\u2019t remember the movie at all. I had to go rent and watch it get myself up to speed about what I was supposed to write.\u201d\n\nDisclosure, as the Big Mouth kids explain through song in the episode\u2019s opening number, is a movie in which Demi Moore plays Michael Douglas\u2019s boss, invites him into her office and gives him oral sex, and then accuses him of sexual harassment after he decides not to have \u201cfull sex\u201d with her. The conceit of parodying a movie-turned-musical, Rivers points out, stretches from The Simpsons\u2019 Planet of the Apes musical through Bobs Burgers\u2019 Working Girl and Die Hard mash-up, but musicalizing Disclosure gave Big Mouth the opportunity to pluck something out of relative obscurity and poke fun of its problematic sexual politics. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be weird and inappropriate,\u201d the kids sing in the opening number. \u201cWe\u2019re making a musical of the movie Disclosure!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like a shitty Me Too backlash take, way before shitty Me Too backlashes were on the map,\u201d Rivers said. To that end, Disclosure the Movie: The Musical! also positions the school\u2019s drama teacher, Terry Lizer (Rob Huebel), as a reactionary man with shitty Me Too backlash takes of his own: Lizer gripes about how men are threatened and how Disclosure speaks to these times, while the more reasonable kids feel confused and angry at both the movie\u2019s politics and the way Terry pressures Lola (Nick Kroll) into giving him foot massages.\n\nAs is usually the case in Big Mouth\u2019s musical numbers, the show\u2019s writers came to Rivers with the premises and contexts of the songs they wanted, then gave him the freedom to fill in everything else. The episode opens with a toe-tapping \u201cputting on a show\u201d number that Rivers described as more challenging than the typical song, given that he had to set up the episode\u2019s premise and \u201cwrite to each character to get their voices properly.\u201d Jessi (Jessi Klein), for instance, sings for the part of Michael Douglas\u2019s wife and dismisses her lines with \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d, Gina (Gina Rodriguez) and Ali (Ali Wong) both complain that they\u2019re cast as racially stereotyped background characters, while Matthew (Andrew Rannells) makes a big entrance announcing, \u201cYour leading man is here,\u201d though because he\u2019s gay, doesn\u2019t actually get cast as the leading man.\n\nBy this point, Rivers said, he\u2019s also learned how to write to the voice actors\u2019 strengths. \u201cNick Kroll and I have about the same vocal range, so if I can sing it, he can sing it,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThen you get to people like Maya Rudolph and Andrew Rannells and the sky\u2019s the limit. Jenny Slate, also a really good singer, though you\u2019d never know it if she\u2019s hidden behind the Missy voice.\u201d\n\nMissy, Slate\u2019s nerdy character who gets cast in the musical\u2019s Demi Moore part, cuts loose later in the episode by performing an imitation \u201cWhatever Lola Wants\u201d number, in which she sings, \u201cAnd when things get rough and tumble, onto my back I shall not flop / \u2019cause an aggressive woman likes to be on top.\u201d The song then triggers the introduction of Missy\u2019s own hormone monster, voiced by Thandie Newton. \u201cEven within the Missy character, she can deliver,\u201d Rivers said.\n\nIn addition to writing the show\u2019s music, Rivers supervises most musical performances in the recording studio, which means coaxing songs out of people who are often better known as comedians. \u201cYou get a lot of apologizing before they\u2019ve done anything,\u201d he said, which means his job involves a lot of reminders that if the singing is funny, it\u2019s helping the character. He pointed to John Mulaney\u2019s performance of \u201cTotally Gay\u201d in season one as a good example: \u201cHe\u2019s on pitch enough, but the squeaky voice of the character coming through is what really makes it work.\u201d\n\nIn terms of writing the songs, Rivers says he typically works within the specific constraints that Big Mouth\u2019s writers give him for what they need, a challenge which he enjoys. He was also happy, he added, that they asked him to work in a variety of genres this season. In addition to the Broadway-style show tunes of Disclosure the Movie: The Musical!, he also created a 1980s metal song about Florida and a song where a Canadian magician (voiced by Martin Short) explains various definitions of sexualities. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely worked on shows where people didn\u2019t know what they want and you\u2019re scrambling to find it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s rarely the case with these guys. They know what they want and that was a huge relief.\u201d", "description": "Big Mouth composer Mark Rivers explains the backstory of the show\u2019s very unlikely musical parody.
