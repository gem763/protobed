And it makes it even harder when the team has been struggling.\n\n\u201cI hoped I could have had a positive impact on the side so it made it even tougher to be sat out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an impatient patient but I did the right things. I hated the time off because I wasn\u2019t doing what I wanted to be doing but that made me pretty relentless with my rehab. Being impatient and disliking being away from the action so much probably got me a few weeks ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nPope\u2019s dislocation came within days of Kent and England\u2019s Sam Billings suffering the same injury in remarkably similar circumstances. Billings has returned with a similar hunger for runs \u2013 scoring three centuries in his three most recent innings \u2013 and the pair had the opportunity to share horror stories while waiting to go under the knife.\n\n\u201cEveryone says we look alike and could actually be the same person,\u201d says Pope, laughing. \u201cHe was the last person I saw before I got wheeled in to have the operation. (The dislocation) was pretty painful. I remember diving and landing. The pain was incredible and then I felt my arm and the bone wasn\u2019t where it used to be. I hobbled off the pitch and sat on the physio\u2019s bench trying to get as much of the oxygen as I could to numb the pain.\n\n\u201cLuckily enough the doctor was there. The shoulder was out for 20 minutes and I had a few firm words with him and told him to get it back in as I was in that much pain. He managed to pop it back in, which made the journey to the hospital a little less painful. I had broken my arm being a bit of an idiot as a youngster on a trampoline but this was worse.\u201d\n\nAt least there was plenty of cricket to keep Pope entertained as he recovered. He was at the Oval for the start of England\u2019s World Cup campaign against South Africa but watched the final against New Zealand on his own, having his nerves shredded in splendid isolation.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t write what happened,\u201d says Pope. \u201cI just watched it in my flat, I was pretty nervous. I couldn\u2019t really enjoy it with anyone, I had to watch it on my own. It\u2019s so good for the game. I was walking down the road and saw cricket on big screens. I\u2019ve seen kids playing on the street, which I don\u2019t think you would have seen at the start of the summer.\n\n\u201cIt has been pretty amazing. I remember watching the 2005 series as a youngster but the number of my mates who haven\u2019t followed cricket before but now think they know it all is amazing. It\u2019s great to see. The crowds we\u2019ve had at the Oval too have been incredible. They\u2019re normally huge at the Oval but we\u2019ve been selling out (T20) games on a Tuesday night as well. It\u2019s a great time to be involved with the sport.\u201d\n\nAnd with a renewed emphasis on Test cricket, Pope looks set to assume a far more central role.", "description": "Back in April, Surrey could reasonably have anticipated this being a week of celebration \u2013 with the county bringing home a second successive County Championship title.\u00a0 As it was, they welcomed Nottinghamshire to the Oval, with an over-riding sense of relief that only one team will be relegated from cricket\u2019s top flight this season.
