It is the perfect breakfast. It fills you up, it keeps you warm. It\u2019s quick to make and, tastewise, it can go in many directions. You can add nuts and dried fruit, honey and cream, banana and Nutella; or you can go savoury, with seeds, cheese, harissa, bacon, soft-boiled eggs or spring onions.\n\nBut porridge does not stop with oats, which is good news for anyone scarred by a childhood of lumpen grey gloop. The world over, you find cereal grains and starchy plants chopped, ground, rolled or otherwise processed and boiled in water (or milk, or stock) until they release their starches and thicken into something creamy. Technically even risotto and congee qualify as types of porridge. (A political analyst called Abigail Pile ushered in 2019 by writing a 1,250-word essay on how to stir your porridge. She took cues from the traditional risotto method \u2013 use water, don\u2019t stop stirring and get yourself one of those wooden rods that the Scots call spurtles.)\n\nTo cater to gluten-free and other alternative diets, supermarkets now stock an impressive array of grains. The following list of alternatives to oats shouldn\u2019t have you scouring the shelves in your local health shop, or emptying your wallet. There\u2019s a reason you find porridge the world over: it\u2019s cheap. So buy a bunch of grains to try, and stock up on toppings. Mornings are about to get interesting.\n\nRye\n\nJust as porridge oats are simply steamed and rolled grains, rye and other cereal kernels, not to mention an array of seeds, can be flattened into flakes. Rye doesn\u2019t result in as creamy a porridge as oats do, so chef Anna Jones suggests a 50/50 ratio of rye flakes and oats. She also recommends soaking the flakes overnight, then straining and toasting them in a dry pan for a bit before boiling. Her flavouring of choice for rye is cocoa powder and almond butter, with a pear compote on the side. It\u2019s a combo that is hard to beat, but blueberries, banana or other fresh fruit would be tasty, too.\n\nAlex Hely-Hutchinson, meanwhile, who founded the London porridge restaurant 26 Grains, ranks the Danish \u00f8llebr\u00f8d \u2013 made from stale rye bread \u2013 as one of the best. You soak the bread in beer (porter or stout works well) overnight, then cook the lot until it\u2019s nice and soft. It\u2019s often flavoured with citrus zest and juice, honey, cinnamon, raisins and a pinch of salt. Hely-Hutchinson plumps for pears, coconut yoghurt, cardamon and maple syrup. \u201cFilling and delicious and completely different from any porridge I\u2019ve ever tasted,\u201d she says.\n\nBuckwheat\n\nAlso known as kasha, buckwheat groats are not a cereal but the triangular seeds of a pretty, white-flowering knotweed. Soaked overnight, then toasted in a pan and simmered in water for half an hour, they make a mean bowlful: nutty, full-bodied, wholesome. The Ukrainian food writer Olia Hercules grew up eating them slathered with melted butter and sugar. You can add a cinnamon stick to the cooking water (or milk) or sprinkle the finished dish with the spice instead, along with any garnish, from fresh fruit to cacao nibs and nuts. And if you make a big batch, it will keep in the fridge for a few days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Southern grits with sausages and biscuits. Photograph: curveadams/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCornmeal\n\nSouthern grits, South African pap, Jamaican porridge, polenta: there are countless uses for cornmeal. While Nigerian fufu and Zimbabwean sadza, say, are less spoonable porridge than grabbable starch with which to eat a meaty stew, the basic idea of cooking ground maize down for breakfast works a treat, too. Choose a finer cornmeal for something smooth, or coarse for more texture, whisk it into boiling water (or a combination of water and whichever milk you like), add spice, sweeten to taste (Jamaican tradition calls for condensed milk) and don\u2019t stop stirring. Beautiful served with a blob of butter, a dash of cold milk or a helping of fruit compote.\n\nMillet\n\nThis small-grained cereal is a staple on the Chinese table, from breakfast to dinner. It is boiled until tender in water, and sweetened \u2013 or salted \u2013 as you like. Maggie Zhu, who runs the website Omnivore\u2019s Cookbook, suggests a savoury take with pickled vegetables and fermented tofu. Some sticky pork on the side would not go amiss.\n\nFor a sweet brekkie, though, Erin Alderson at Naturally Ella cracks her millet first in a coffee grinder or blender, then fries it in a knob of butter before boiling it in a mixture of milk and water. She serves it with roasted strawberries sweetened with maple syrup and cardamom.\n\nRice\n\nLike millet, savoury rice porridge is commonplace throughout Asia \u2013 from okayu in Japan to Chinese congee and Thai khao tom \u2013 mostly because it is an excellent way to use up leftover rice. Very broadly, you simmer the rice in stock (fish, or chicken, but veggie would work, too), season with something salty (depending on the cuisine, that will be soy, fish sauce etc) and serve variously with pork, chicken, shrimp, greens, pickles or soft-boiled eggs and a garnish of some kind (sesame seeds, spring onion, fried garlic and ginger, chopped peanuts or coriander).\n\nBut rice makes great sweet porridge, too, like the Swedish Christmas favourite risgrynsgrr\u00f6t. Short-grain pudding rice is cooked in milk and water with a cinnamon stick, sweetened with sugar and served with butter.\n\nQuinoa\n\nQuinoa is prized as a porridge base for its high protein content. The food writer Sara Buenfeld cooks hers with water, a dash of vanilla essence and creamed coconut, then stirs in coconut yogurt and chia seeds. To serve, she adds more coconut yogurt, fresh berries and flaked almonds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Semolina with strawberry compote. Photograph: Ildi.Food/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nSemolina\n\nHoney and Co\u2019s Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich say this is their favourite \u2013 richly flavoured with vanilla and cream, and topped with strawberry compote infused with black peppercorns and bay, plus a spoonful of yoghurt.\n\nAmaranth\n\nAnother pseudocereal, from another flowering beauty. These seeds are small and round, and cook down into something much tamer than buckwheat could ever manage. The New York Times\u2019s Martha Rose Shulman does this with a mixture of milk and water, brown sugar, maple syrup and a pinch of salt. Which, you will note, is the sort of technique that works for every other porridge base here, oats included. In other words, if you like bogstandard oats, none of these \u2013 however unknown to you \u2013 should prove anything less than pure comfort.", "description": "Sweet or savoury, with cornmeal, quinoa, rice or millet, this warming breakfast lends itself to so many variations", "authors": ["Dale Berning Sawa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396a68f973c7d895c1e1d11e903015afc5114129/0_1877_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1d3d83f75c51928bf4c7d9b321a8666"}
