(Reuters) - Joe Biden, courting donors at a fundraiser in California on Thursday, began his remarks by reading directly from a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that President Donald Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden makes a statement during an event in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Bastiaan Slabbers/File Photo\n\nAs Trump faces an impeachment inquiry over his demands that his Ukrainian counterpart investigate Biden, his top Democratic rival is striving to turn the growing political crisis to his advantage, raking in donations and taking to national television to make his case to voters that he is the Democrat best able to beat Trump next year.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday alleged that Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in next year\u2019s election for his own political benefit, but that the White House also tried to \u201clock down\u201d evidence about that conduct.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\u201d Biden told a few dozen guests gathered by a backyard swimming pool to hear the candidate at the fundraiser in San Marino, California.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine flap comes at a crucial moment for the former vice president.\n\nThe Democratic favourite throughout much of the race, Biden has seen his support erode in recent weeks, with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren emerging as the candidate with the greatest momentum and drawing close to Biden in several national polls.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that Biden used his influence as vice president to kill an investigation of a Ukrainian energy company of which his son Hunter was a board member.\n\nThe controversy has allowed Biden to portray himself as Trump\u2019s top target, bolstering his long-standing argument that he is the candidate the president fears most.\n\n\u201cTrump is afraid of facing Joe next fall,\u201d one text sent to supporters read. \u201cChip in now to defend Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign enjoyed its best week of fundraising since early in the race, aides said, without providing specific figures.\n\n\u201cThe reason I am being attacked is that most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,\u201d Biden told a crowd at another fundraiser in Baltimore earlier this week. \u201cI am not at all surprised I have become the object of his affection and attention.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, Biden had delivered a blistering indictment of Trump in a nationally televised speech and he appeared on Wednesday on a late-night network talk show. For the moment, at least, Warren and the other 17 candidates running for the Democratic nomination have been rendered afterthoughts.\n\nBiden\u2019s calendar has been packed with previously scheduled fundraising events all week. On Friday, he will hold a campaign event in the early primary state of Nevada.\n\nRick Tyler, a Republican strategist who worked for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump\u2019s outreach to Ukraine \u201creinforces Biden\u2019s strongest underlying message, which is that he is the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump and even Donald Trump thinks so \u2013 and the lengths Trump will go to eliminate him now because he sees him as the biggest threat.\u201d\n\nTOLL AND TRIAL\n\nTrump and his allies have signalled, however, that they plan to continue accusing Biden of wrongdoing\n\nTrump has pushed that narrative this week even as the impeachment inquiry moves forward, and a pro-Trump group, Great America PAC, is backing it up with an ad blitz.\n\n\u201cThis is a Joe Biden scandal that Democrats and their media allies are trying to remake into a Donald Trump problem,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump re-election campaign.\n\nThe focus on Ukraine and Biden could take a toll on the Biden campaign, said Rodell Mollineau, a former Democratic top aide to U.S. Senate leadership.\n\n\u201cIt looks like his numbers were sliding a bit before, and I don\u2019t think this helps,\u201d Mollineau said. \u201cAnd because he\u2019s in a primary, he doesn\u2019t have the whole Democratic machine rallying to his defence.\u201d\n\nSince Biden entered the race in April, Trump routinely has derided him as \u201csleepy\u201d and \u201cnot very bright\u201d and publicly dismissed him as a threat.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s campaign has long viewed Biden as a danger because of his capacity to attract the kind of union and working-class voters in the Midwest who also are drawn to Trump. It has sought to weaken his candidacy at several turns, with the president\u2019s phone call with Ukraine only the most recent example.\n\nThe campaign realized early on that with his moderate voting record, it would be harder to paint Biden as a \u201csocialist\u201d in the manner of Warren or U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a Republican strategist close to the Trump campaign said.\n\nInstead, it has gone after issues such as trade with China and Biden\u2019s foreign policy record as No. 2 to former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Ukraine matter is yet more evidence that Biden remains the opponent that Trump would still rather avoid, Biden\u2019s campaign said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so transparent,\u201d one Biden aide told Reuters, \u201cit\u2019s laughable.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden, courting donors at a fundraiser in California on Thursday, began his remarks by reading directly from a whistleblower's complaint that President Donald Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Ginger Gibson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434343195&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q01O", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
