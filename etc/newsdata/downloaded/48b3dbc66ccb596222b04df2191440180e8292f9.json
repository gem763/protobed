Lady Gaga\u2019s Beauty Line Launches Today", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Courtesy of Haus Laboratories\n\nPrime Day 2019, also known as your one chance to reserve Mother Monster\u2019s baby beauty products, seems like decades ago, but today is the day: Lady Gaga\u2019s inclusive beauty line, Haus Laboratories, is officially live and up for grabs.\n\nIf you\u2019re a procrastinator who didn\u2019t pre-order your stuff on Prime Day, you\u2019ll be happy to know that in addition to the six collections and individual products that were unveiled earlier this summer, the brand is debuting three even newer products today: Liquid Eye-Lie-Ner, an extremely black \u201cMatter Than Matte\u201d liner; Armor Wingtips, reusable stickers in the shape of eye liner flicks that make you look like you\u2019re really good at liner; and No.1 Face Masque Armor, another, more intricate face sticker that will make you look like you do calligraphy as a side hustle.\n\nWhile these eye-focused launches are inspired by Gaga\u2019s bold looks (like her signature black liner that she\u2019d mattify with black shadow back in the day) they were all made with ease and convenience in mind. \u201cOne of the first tours where I actually worked with Gaga all the time was the Jazz Tony Bennett tour, and she wanted all this quick-change makeup,\u201d says Sarah Tanno, Gaga\u2019s longtime makeup artist and global artistry director of Haus Laboratories. \u201cShe wanted me to do an eyeliner change in 30 seconds, with a wig being put on, while trying to change mics, while I\u2019m standing over to the side thinking I\u2019m just going to poke this girl in the eye.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Tanno called up Phyllis Cohen from Face Lace (which recently starred in Euphoria) to come up with face stickers that quickly created things like skinny brows, a removable Super Bowl half-time show look, and now Armor Masques, Gaga\u2019s gift to you. \u201cIt was really important to Gaga to bring these tricks and things she\u2019s fallen in love with to consumers in a different way,\u201d Tanno explains. But both she and Gaga just want you to do you whether you\u2019re on a stage or not. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is a bunch of people trying to go look like Lady Gaga. That\u2019s not the point of this brand. We want you to use these tools that we\u2019ve created for you to express yourself in whatever way that is, whether that\u2019s wearing very little making or building a persona for the day. Beauty has really helped Gaga in that way.\u201d\n\nSo draw all over your eyes or don\u2019t. But if you do, allow Gaga to make it way easier and more enjoyable with free two-day shipping and stickers you can quickly slap on.\n\nHAUS LABORATORIES by Lady Gaga: EYE ARMOR KIT, Liquid Eyeliner and Wingtip Stickers $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nHAUS LABORATORIES by Lady Gaga: ARMOR MASQUE NO. 1, Face Masque Armor Sticker $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Lady Gaga\u2019s beauty line Haus Laboratories officially launches today and brand brought three new products with it to celebrate: a matte liquid eyeliner, eyeliner stickers and a face mask sticker, all available on Amazon.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/16/16-LG_EYE-ARMOR.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
