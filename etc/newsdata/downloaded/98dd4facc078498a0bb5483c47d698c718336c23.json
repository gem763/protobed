Oil edges higher but on track for big weekly loss By Roslan Khasawneh\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Oil futures edged higher on\n\nFriday but were on track for a large weekly loss on fears that\n\nslower global economic growth will hurt fuel demand, while Saudi\n\nArabia said it has fully restored oil output after recent\n\nattacks.\n\nBrent crude oil futures rose 8 cents, or 0.1%, to\n\n$57.79 a barrel by 0138 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate\n\n(WTI) crude futures rose 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $52.57 a\n\nbarrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent futures were down 6.7%, marking its\n\nlargest weekly loss since December, while WTI was down 6%, its\n\nbiggest decline since July.\n\nWeak U.S. services sector and jobs growth data on Thursday\n\nadded to worries about global oil demand and exacerbated fears\n\nthat a protracted U.S.-China trade war could push the global\n\neconomy into a recession. \"Concerns about global oil demand are rising, and next\n\nweek's U.S.-China trade talks, the significant X factor, will be\n\nparticularly important, given the sharp drop in the oil price\n\nover the last week,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market\n\nstrategist at AxiTrader.\n\nSaudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman\n\nalso said on Thursday the world's top crude oil exporter has\n\nfully restored oil output after attacks on its facilities last\n\nmonth that knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\n\"The mood wasn't helped by news that Saudi Arabia has\n\nmanaged a speedy recovery from the recent attacks,\" ANZ Bank\n\nsaid in a note on Friday.\n\nHowever, recent data showing a slowdown in U.S. shale output\n\nand drilling activity could lend some support. \"Continued falls in drilling activity has seen monthly\n\ngrowth in U.S. shale oil output fall, from 150 thousand barrels\n\nper day (kbpd) to only 50 kbpd,\" said ANZ.\n\n\"This is likely to linger well into 2020.\"\n\n\n\nOil edges higher but on track for big weekly loss", "description": "Oil edges higher but on track for big weekly loss", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5T0D5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
