Strasburg, who pitched the Nationals to a 6-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday at Nationals Park, has been as good but seldom better than in his past eight starts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg furthered his case with 10 strikeouts, including three of Bryce Harper (all swinging), to set a new career high of 251. Strasburg threw only 92 pitches and left after six innings, perhaps a tip the Nats want to keep him fresh for Tuesday. In the dugout, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, Gerardo Parra and Victor Robles engulfed him in a goofy group hug.\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong between a three-time Cy Young Award winner and a fully mature Strasburg, who had a 0.00 ERA in the 2017 playoffs. I\u2019d, gulp, go with Strasburg.\n\nAssuming Corbin doesn\u2019t start, should he be the first pitcher out of the bullpen in such a season-on-the-line game? Wouldn\u2019t the left-hander be effective against a Milwaukee Brewers lineup stacked with left-handed hitters? For a day, Corbin would also give the Nats a second lefty to complement Sean Doolittle in the relief corps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStephen Strasburg makes his final case to start National League wild-card game\n\nMy preference for Tuesday \u2014 as Pitching Plan A \u2014 would be Strasburg to Corbin to NLDS. If necessary, add Doolittle, who looked like the best version of \u201cObi-Sean\u201d on Wednesday with six swing-and-misses on high fastballs in one inning.\n\nAssuming Milwaukee doesn\u2019t end up passing the St. Louis Cardinals to win the NL Central, no one would be foolish enough to look past a Brewers team that has won 18 of its past 20 games, even without star Christian Yelich for the past 10 of them. But, if Corbin worked in relief, the Nationals\u2019 rotation for the Dodgers would line up excellently with everyone on ideal rest. Scherzer could pitch Game 1 and S\u00e1nchez (10-2, 3.45 ERA in his past 21 starts) Game 2. Corbin could start Game 3 at Nationals Park, where he is 8-1 with a 1.93 ERA, followed by Strasburg in Game 4 and then Scherzer if there is a Game 5 back in L.A.\n\nNext dilemma: If Scherzer gets the start in the wild-card game, which would certainly provide Max Theater, should Kurt Suzuki, the \u201cRBI machine\u201d who usually catches him but who has a somewhat sore elbow, still be behind the plate? Why not recently hot Yan Gomes (.867 on-base-plus-slugging percentage over the past 30 days) no matter who pitches?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat should the Nats\u2019 lineup \u2014 especially the right side of the infield \u2014 look like in such a vital game? How can you possibly keep Howie Kendrick, batting .345, or Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, who has 37 RBI in his 36 games with the Nats, out of the lineup?\n\nTo be honest, this isn\u2019t a fair question. Kendrick has the highest batting average in MLB in September and has hit everything on the screws for weeks. If he doesn\u2019t start Tuesday, it\u2019s grounds to impeach. On Thursday, Cabrera had a sacrifice fly, walk, double off the top of the right field wall and a homer to center.\n\nTeams that go deep into October often have an \u201cX factor\u201d that no one, including the team itself, expected. An extra piece just falls in their laps thanks to someone else\u2019s gaffe or just fate. To pick up a 33-year-old switch-hitter in August with 1,644 career hits who can play every infield position \u2014 and is red hot, hitting .320 with a .934 OPS with the Nats \u2014 is close to baseball lunacy. To pick him up for free, off the street, with Texas paying his salary, just doesn\u2019t happen. But it did. Ride it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera evolved to become the utility player the Nationals need\n\nHowever, common decency requires consideration for second baseman Brian Dozier, who won a Gold Glove in 2016, and first baseman Matt Adams, because both have 20 homers. Adams also has 56 RBI in only 301 at-bats. What about Ryan Zimmerman, the original \u201cFace of the Franchise,\u201d who has looked spry since returning from injury with an .815 OPS \u2014 his career norm \u2014 for the past month?\n\nSorry, no room Tuesday. But stay tuned \u2014 October can be a long month.\n\nFinally, in a bullpen that recently had no one who could credibly be called a \u201ccloser,\u201d who should have that role now that the Nats appear to have two men suitable for the job? Daniel Hudson has a 1.57 ERA in 22 games with the Nationals, including two saves in a doubleheader Tuesday and another on Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nDoolittle, in back-to-back scoreless innings Tuesday and Wednesday, looked like his old rising-fastball self but perhaps with some newly added polish on and confidence in his slider and change-up. Does one set up the other? Or should Dave Martinez navigate the last six outs by matchup?\n\nAD\n\nBy now, that common thread in all these \u201cdilemmas\u201d should be obvious. In all these tough decisions, the Nats have nothing but good to wonderful options. And the reason is simple. This team is in 99 percent perfect health, something that almost never happens as October arrives. And the whole roster is flat-out loaded.\n\nSometimes that Nationals power is disguised behind platoons or quasi-platoons where players rotate through various positions. That\u2019s why few people notice, and even fewer analyze, how the Nats can be the No. 2 scoring team in the NL, barely behind the famous Dodgers and a hair ahead of the stacked Atlanta Braves.\n\nAD\n\nTeams with depth, especially veteran depth that can be injury-prone, seldom reach the final weekend of a season with all of their options intact. And a team with a huge weakness, such as the Nats\u2019 5.69 ERA bullpen, seldom arrives at this stage looking \u2014 for the first time \u2014 like it might become functional if it could get deep into October when a multitude of days off make almost every reliever better.\n\nAD\n\nState of the race: Nationals maintain lead to host wild-card game\n\nIn fact, they are so healthy and so deep that, if the Nats face Milwaukee, they may be uniquely suited to combat a team with a bullpen so deep that the Brewers can, in a wild-card game, start playing matchups as if the third inning is the seventh. Look for the Nats to carry 15 or 16 position players to match moves.\n\n\u201cIt feels good that, all of a sudden, guys are swinging the bats a lot better,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cOur pitching\u2019s doing good. Our bullpen\u2019s pitching better. Everything seems to be clicking right now. So we\u2019re in a good place right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDon\u2019t race to find the nearest sports book. Wild-card games are incredibly intense and utterly unpredictable \u2014 a fog of war field of battle waiting for an unexpected hero who could be the third pinch hitter off the bench. Even if the Nats advance, the Houston Astros and Dodgers are even more loaded \u2014 on paper.\n\nAD\n\nBut, for the past 108 games \u2014 two-thirds of a season \u2014 the Nats have played at a 106-win pace and outscored foes at a rate appropriate to a 110-win team. Nobody, not the best in either league, is much better than the Nats right now.\n\nWhen the playoffs are about to start, \u201cright now\u201d may be the most essential phrase in the game. It doesn\u2019t matter what your club looked like in spring or summer. What does it look like at this instant?\n\nThe Nats have been doing many things right for more than four months. If they can get past Tuesday, an enormous if, they may have world enough and time to show they can keep doing it for quite a bit longer.\n\nAD", "description": "Manager Dave Martinez has a number of tough decisions to make before Tuesday, and there are few bad choices.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jIikVYhv7ceanMlQ0Gx46aD_SEQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLB6TOXAWII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
