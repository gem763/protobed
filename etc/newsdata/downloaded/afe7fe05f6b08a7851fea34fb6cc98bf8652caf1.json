There was talk about higher silver prices, as much as $100. per ounce and more, yet, only a few months later, silver was down to $10 an ounce, which amounted to a decline of nearly 80% from its peak.\n\nAt today\u2019s price of $17.50 per ounce, however, silver needs to increase by almost 500% to reach the $100 mark and it needs to be at least $163 just to match its January 1980 high. Think about that. Even if it manages to reach the vaunted $100 price, silver will still be 40% cheaper than it was 50 years ago.\n\nThe next time you hear that silver\u2019s big day is just around the corner, ask yourself what has changed. Silver\u2019s fundamentals are not much different today than they have been for the past half-century, and silver\u2019s price history doesn\u2019t indicate anything that supports or justifies projections of $100 per ounce and higher.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Lorimer Wilson covering: .
