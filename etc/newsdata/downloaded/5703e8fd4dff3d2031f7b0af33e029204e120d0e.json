This is the fourth time in school history that Memphis has started 5-0. The Tigers also won its first five games in 1938, 1961 and 2015.\n\nMemphis is 5\u00bd-point favorites to get the win that moves them to 6-0. Kenneth Gainwell has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s most productive running backs since taking over for an injured Patrick Taylor Jr. early this season. Gainwell has run for 620 yards and averages 124 yards rushing per game to rank sixth among all Football Bowl Subdivision players.\n\nGainwell averages 151.8 all-purpose yards per game, which ranks fourth nationally.\n\n\u201cTheir commitment to the run sets up every thing that they do,\u201d Carey said. \u201cThey certainly have dynamic playmakers. Everything is set up with that run game.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers are plenty potent on offense. Brady White has thrown three touchdown passes in each of Memphis\u2018 last three games and ranks seventh among all FBS players in passing efficiency (184.95) and 13th in completion percentage (.717).\n\n\u201cYou turn on the film and you see really good football players, really well coached, dynamic and explosive,\u201d Carey said.\n\nThe AAC West is setting up for quite a finish with the Tigers, SMU, Tulane and Navy all off to good starts. Houston also is still in the mix.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re jumping into conference play, I think anybody and everybody across the country sees the quality of the American Conference and the teams we have in it,\u201d Memphis coach Mike Norvell said. \u201cThis week we\u2019re going to play one of the best of them.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know about Temple\u2019s matchup with Memphis:\n\nTEMPLE DEFENSE\n\nTemple ranks second among all FBS teams in red-zone defense and fourth in third-down conversion percentage defense. Temple is allowing teams to convert just 24.4% of their third-down situations.\n\nTemple defensive tackle Ifeanyi Maijeh has 30 tackles, 8\u00bd tackles for loss and five sacks to lead the Owls in all three categories. He\u2019s tied for the AAC lead in sacks per game and tackles for loss per game. Maijeh has recorded at least two tackles for loss in four of Temple\u2019s first five games.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the best defenses in the country,\u201d Norvell said. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely talented, they\u2019ve got great length, experience. Their three linebackers, they can play anywhere in the country.\n\n100-YARD STREAK\n\nMemphis\u2018 Kenneth Gainwell has exceeded the 100-yard mark in three straight games, including a 209-yard performance last week in a 52-33 victory over Louisiana-Monroe.\n\nThe impressive freshman could face his toughest test in finding those 100 yards against a Temple defense that ranks second in the AAC in run defense, yielding 3.2 yards per carry and 125.6 yards rushing per game. Memphis also lost running backs Darrell Henderson and Tony Pollard to the NFL draft and had counted on Taylor, who rushed for over 1,100 yards last year, to carry the running back. But once he was injured in the season opener, Gainwell made the most of his chance in the spotlight. Gainwell is on pace to deliver the fourth 1,000-yard single-season rushing performance in the last three years for Memphis. That comes after Memphis didn\u2019t have a single 1,000-yard rusher from 2010-16.\n\nTOUGH SKED\n\nThis game begins a demanding stretch for Temple, which visits No. 21 SMU and hosts Central Florida the next two weeks. Temple has won its last seven games at the Linc.\n\nBOWL BID\n\nMemphis is trying to become the fourth team in program history to start 6-0 and clinch its earliest bowl bid in history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Temple wants to go 2-for-2 in knocking off Top 25 teams at home.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/memphis_temple_preview_football_71401_c0-225-5408-3379_s1200x700.jpg?061f4a8c6faa2ee2976b4d6e3c331f3267d676c7", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
