You know, we were working on guns, gun safety.\"\n\nCanada, the United States and Mexico signed the agreement last year to replace the trillion-dollar North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and it must now be ratified.\n\nLighthizer later said was confident USMCA would come up for a vote because it is an extremely good agreement and \u201cif it did not pass it would be a catastrophe for our economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the legislation should be modified to address Democrats' concerns, including reservations about the enforceability of the labor and environment provisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMEXICO, CANADA LEADERS URGE RATIFICATION\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the deal should be passed by the U.S. Congress quickly, not left until closer to the November 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"It's better if this gets resolved soon. It's in the interest of all three nations,\" Lopez Obrador told journalists at a daily media briefing.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \"We've always been focused on the ratification of the USMCA in a way that tries to go beyond the partisan differences in the United States.\"\n\n\"Our focus remains on ensuring that this deal ... goes forward and that\u2019s what we are going to remain focused on,\" said Trudeau.\n\nMexico's peso <MXN=> slipped as much as 0.9% versus the dollar to an almost three-week low, and the benchmark Mexican stock index <.MXX> fell as much 1.24%, with banks citing the impeachment inquiry as sapping investor appetite for risk.
