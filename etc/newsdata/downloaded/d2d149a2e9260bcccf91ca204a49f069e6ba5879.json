I\u2019m doing it for myself to prove to myself at 51 I can still do new things. I want to set that example for my daughters and it\u2019s all about that and learning how to dance.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Michelle revealed she was also visiting the chiropractor before another eight hours of rehearsals for Strictly", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642878.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_JS196139116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
