The planned multi-billion-dollar transfer \u2014 which has been strongly denounced by Democrats \u2014 is expected to defund more than 120 construction projects that the military was hoping to conduct over the next years.\n\nDocuments obtained by CBS News show the reprogramming request by the White House will divert funds that the Pentagon had previously designated for a diverse set of projects in the U.S. and around the world, from a missile facility in Alaska and an engineering center at the U.S. Army Academy at West Point, to a hangar at a U.S. Air Force Base in Japan and a veterinary facility for working dogs at the U.S. Navy Base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nFunds for the construction of schools at military bases and facilities will be transferred to finance the construction of border barriers, including a $62,634,000 grant for a middle school at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and a $56,048,000 grant for an elementary school for children of U.S. troops stationed in Wiesbaden, Germany.\n\nIn this June 29, 2017 photo made available by the U.S. Air Force, an F-15 fighter plane taxis back to the hangar at Kadena Air Base, Japan.

In the U.S., the largest grant affected would be $88,960,000 funds to extend the pier at the U.S. Navy base in Bangor, Washington.\n\nMost of the affected projects were slated to receive the grants in 2020 or 2021 and some had previously been cancelled. On Wednesday, a Pentagon official told CBS News the department will look to offset the transfer by asking Congress for more money to fund the affected projects. The official said the projects will not be delayed if additional funds are approved by lawmakers but cautioned that there is no guarantee that will occur.\n\nU.S. troops gather on the USS Wasp where U.S. President Donald Trump will deliver Memorial Day remarks to the troops, at the U.S. Military Base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, Tuesday, May 28, 2019. Eugene Hoshiko / AP\n\nThe decision to transfer $3.6 billion from the military to finance the construction of border barriers, along with Secretary of Defense Mike Esper's authorization on Tuesday, have been widely criticized by Democrats, who have accused the administration of politicizing resources for U.S. service members.\n\n\"The American people cannot be asked to foot the bill a second time for projects that this administration has decided are less important than a vanity wall that will do nothing to end the humanitarian crisis on the southern border or protect our national security,\" Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Dick Durbin of Illinois wrote in a joint statement. \"The President promised that Mexico would pay for his wall, not the military and their families.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has said it will mount a legal challenge to try to stop the $3.6 billion transfer, which represents the second move by administration to divert billions in military funds for construction along the southern border. The administration has already been using some of the $2.5 billion funds it diverted from the Pentagon earlier this year, since the Supreme Court said it could do so while a legal challenge to that transfer proceeds in court.\n\nTo justify both transfers, the administration has relied on the controversial national emergency declaration the president made in February after the Democratic-led House refused to approve his multi-billion-dollar demand for border wall funding.\n\nDavid Martin and Rebecca Kaplan contributed reporting.", "description": "The administration is planning to divert military funds allocated to build shooting ranges, missile launching pads and even schools for children at military bases in the U.S. and abroad", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/6672a46c-e408-4e64-8964-097aad7ae347/thumbnail/1200x630/ad8ba51b096fb328c9401faed92ff2a4/ap-19148240699940.jpg"}
