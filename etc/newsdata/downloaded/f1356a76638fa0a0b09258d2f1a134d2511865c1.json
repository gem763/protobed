There's a sense that there's always more going on than meets the eye.\"\n\nLondon Transport Museum has been running tours of some of the sealed-off stations across the city sporadically since the 1970s.\n\nHowever Hidden London, the museum's exclusive program of tours and events at disused stations and secret sites, wasn't launched until 2015.\n\nIt began with tours of Charing Cross station, Clapham South, Down Street and Aldwych, before adding eight others, including the Clapham South deep-level shelter in south London and the abandoned tunnels of Euston in central London.\n\n\"We accumulated so much new information while researching the tours that we weren't able to fit everything in,\" explains Holloway. \"That's where the book was borne out of.\"\n\nPhotographers Toby Madden and Andy Davies captured some of the eeriest parts of the underground world, such as the sealed tunnels located under the Thames and derelict passenger walkways, for the project, which will also form part of an upcoming exhibition at the London Transport Museum.\n\nBeautifully preserved\n\nThe booking office at Aldwych station, which closed in 1917.

Also, it still has all the offices and facilities placed there for the duration of World War II.\"\n\nThe design and architecture on display at the disused stations is captivating, particularly the Edwardian ticket hall tiling design at the non-operational York Road station, located between King's Cross and Caledonian Road, and the original ticket office at Aldwych.\n\nThe reasons behind the closures of the stations, or in some cases, sections of the stations, vary.\n\nSome were shut to make way for sites more equipped for elevators, others were terminated to help speed up the network as London's population grew and the tube got busier, while others closed so they could be turned into ventilation shafts.\n\nRelated content London's underground mail rail to open to visitors\n\nOff limits\n\nThe sealed tunnel entrance that leads from King William Street station.

People have to have their wits about them.\n\n\"We're going behind the scenes of one of the busiest networks in the world, so we have to be adequately prepared for any scenario.\"\n\nIn fact, some of the stations featured in the book are still almost completely inaccessible for this very reason.\n\nKing William Street, the oldest, disused deep tube station in London, remains out of bounds as it only has a single entry and exit point.\n\n\"When taking people into a disused space, we always ensure there's a secondary exit point,\" explains Holloway. \"You have to provide an adequate escape route.\"\n\nHowever, the team at Transport for London are intent on adding more disused areas to their programe, with the old part of Moorgate station in the City of London next on the horizon.\n\n\"It's the lure of the unknown that makes it so appealing,\" says Holloway. \"The visceralness of being able to go into completely unique spaces.", "description": "A new book from the London Transport Museum uncovers the secret world of London's abandoned stations and underground structures.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190918122454-abandoned-london-underground-tz-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
