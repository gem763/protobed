(Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nMovie critic\n\nRating: (2 stars)\n\nFrom the hysterical levels of overpraise, concern-trolling and general hype that have greeted \u201cJoker,\u201d casual observers might assume that it\u2019s either genius, right-wing propaganda or some diabolically potent combination thereof. The truth is, it\u2019s just a movie \u2014 a fine movie, not a great movie, a movie that will please the specific subculture of fans it aims to service, while those who have survived this long without caring about comic-book movies can go on not caring.\n\nA grim, shallow, distractingly derivative homage to 1970s movies at their grittiest, \u201cJoker\u201d continues the dubious darker-is-deeper tradition that Christopher Nolan helped codify with his \u201cBatman\u201d films. Here, director Todd Phillips \u2014 best known for raunchy bro-downs such as \u201cThe Hangover\u201d \u2014 takes the tonal atmosphere to an even more grisly, nihilistic level, throwing out cinematic references as fast as he can look up Martin Scorsese\u2019s filmography. \u201cJoker\u201d is a flagrantly seedy movie, one that constantly evokes the garbage, vermin and social apathy that New York was known for at its worst. Welcome to Gotham City, where the weak are killed and eaten.\n\nAnd no one is weaker than Arthur Fleck, an aspiring stand-up comedian whose day job is working as a clown, either entertaining kids in the hospital or sign-waving on crowded city streets. Portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in a florid, Pagliacci-like turn as sad-clown-turned-mad-clown, Arthur is a pathetic man-child who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy), jotting down idle thoughts and bad puns in his joke journal (\u201cI just hope my death makes more cents than my life\u201d) and nursing a deluded ambition to appear on a late-night show hosted by a comic named Murray Franklin. The fact that Franklin is played by Robert De Niro is just one of many nods to Scorsese, in this case to the brilliant \u201cKing of Comedy.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoaquin Phoenix stars in \u201cJoker.\u201d (Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nIn that film, of course, De Niro played the unhinged fan; now, he\u2019s assuming the chair occupied by Jerry Lewis in that film. The reversal is clever, but maybe too clever by half, as \u201cJoker\u201d doubles down on the movie quotes, invoking \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cModern Times\u201d and the entire \u201970s canon of grimy urban classics. (Apparently Gotham has its version of Steven Sondheim, too.) Although Phillips can be commended for borrowing from the best, the hat-tips become exhausting, as \u201cJoker\u201d begins to feel less like an original film (it\u2019s the first production that Warner Bros. is releasing on its label of stand-alone films inspired by DC Comics), and more like a funhouse reflection of images and themes we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nAnd, yes, it\u2019s a reflection of our own modern times, albeit not a particularly insightful one. Drawing on such notorious historical figures as John Wayne Gacy and \u201csubway vigilante\u201d Bernard Goetz, Phoenix creates a character who epitomizes the self-pity, entitlement and rage that have infected a small but disproportionately vocal (and psychotically violent) cohort of American society. He doesn\u2019t start out as a miscreant \u2014 it takes him being victimized by a wanton mugging to set him on that path \u2014 but by the time \u201cJoker\u201d reaches its anarchic, blood-spattered climax, he\u2019s become the avatar of a populist movement of like-minded losers, who instead of wielding torches and pitchforks don green fright wigs and red noses.\n\nAs an origin story, \u201cJoker\u201d is vivid and convincing (and offers a tantalizingly fateful encounter connecting Arthur to the wider universe), but mostly it serves as a canvas for Phoenix, who goes to strenuous lengths to deliver a performance of operatic bombast. Alarmingly emaciated, affecting a maniacal laugh that Arthur barks out when he\u2019s scared or angry or confused, he delivers a self-consciously larger-than-life performance in a role that simply doesn\u2019t warrant the gravitas afforded to it by fans and filmmakers alike. \u201cJoker\u201d is, finally, so monotonously grandiose and full of its own pretensions that it winds up feeling puny and predictable. Like the anti-hero at its center, it's a movie trying so hard to be capital-b Big that it can\u2019t help looking small.", "description": "\u201cJoker\u201d continues the dubious darker-is-deeper tradition of the recent Batman films.", "authors": ["Ann Hornaday", "Movie Critic", "October At Pm", "Ann Hornaday Is The Washington Post'S Chief Film Critic.
