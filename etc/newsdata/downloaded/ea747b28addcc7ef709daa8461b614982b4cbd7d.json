Meanwhile, the president has continued to deny any such quid pro quo deal, instead insisting that he was pushing the country to address its corruption problems.\n\nRegardless, Trump still passed the blame on to the former Texas governor while at a meeting with House Republicans last week, according to an Axios news report. Perry did not deny encouraging Trump to take the phone call with the Ukrainian president, however, he did tell the Associated Press that he was under the impression that the conversation between the two leaders would revolve around \u201cenergy security and economic development\u201d and not Joe Biden or potential money for military aid.\n\nPrior to the recent impeachment investigation, Perry had been keeping a low profile while heading the Department of Energy. The 69-year-old Texas native refuted claims in Politico on Monday that he would be leaving his post at the end of November.\n\nDon\u2019t count on Perry cooperating with the Democrats subpoena, however, as White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Democrats claiming the impeachment investigation was unconstitutional while telling lawmakers that the White House will not comply with their requests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Energy Secretary Rick Perry received a subpoena today over his role in President Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/1bea26de-rick-perry-ap1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
