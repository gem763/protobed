It should come as no surprise to most that residents in parts of New York City and Los Angeles have the highest rents in the nation. However, the extent to which they do is truly staggering: Out of the 50 zip codes that made the list, 46 are in New York and California.\n\nTo discover these hotspots, the renters\u2019 listing service ranked zip codes with the most expensive rents in more than 130 major U.S. markets using Yardi Matrix data. This study used the actual rent charged in apartment buildings with 50 or more rentals units \u2014 totaling about 15 million apartments.\n\nGraphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nIf you live in Manhattan\u2019s 10282, in Battery Park City, you\u2019ve got the highest rent in the nation, paying an average monthly rent of $6,211, and that\u2019s up 12% year-over-year. It\u2019s the third year in a row that the swanky Manhattan neighborhood took the top spot. \u201cThe river-side neighborhood is seeing a tremendous increase in demand after getting a slew of high-end restaurants and big-name luxury retailers in the past few years,\u201d the study found. Spots 2 and 3 are also in the Big Apple.\n\nAccording to the data, East Harlem\u2019s 10029 zip code was the biggest mover compared to last year\u2019s list. It climbed 26 spots, while zip code 10018, in NYC\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood, plunged 18 positions.\n\nThe most expensive zip code outside of Manhattan is 90024, in Westwood, LA, which ranked fourth, with an average rent of $4,944. Boston is the only city outside of California and New York to make the top 50 list, with four zip codes on the list.
