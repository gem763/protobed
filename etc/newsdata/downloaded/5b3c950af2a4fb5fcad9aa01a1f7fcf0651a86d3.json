But it declined to release any other information the families had sought, which could have further complicated already-tense relations between Washington and Riyadh.\n\nThe decision, revealed in a Thursday court filing, marks the latest turn in a long battle between the families and the FBI to get access to an unredacted copy of the report and other information. The families sought the document as part of a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia that accuses its government of helping coordinate the 2001 attacks.\n\nVictims\u2019 families had for months urged the government to provide the full report, telling President Trump in a letter recently that it would help them \u201cfinally learn the full truth and obtain justice from Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe FBI, citing the \u201cexceptional nature of the case\u201d said it would only provide the name of the one Saudi official that the families had wanted most to obtain, but no other information. The name of the official won\u2019t be made public, but would be given privately to lawyers for the victims\u2019 families, according to the filing.\n\nJames Kreindler, an attorney for the families, said they intend to file a motion to lift the protective order, and would continue to fight for more information. He said the name that was revealed wasn\u2019t a surprise but declined to characterize the person further.\n\nThe families celebrated the decision. \u201cThis was a key document, but by no means the only evidence we have been pursuing and securing from the FBI,\u201d the families said in a statement, describing it as a \u201cbig victory and good result.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official played down the significance of the information, saying that the document\u2019s reference to the Saudi official at issue referred to an \u201cinvestigative theory being pursued by the FBI at that time\u201d and \u201cdoes not represent an objective statement of fact.\u201d\n\nThe official said the FBI was shielding additional information to protect classified information related to \u201congoing investigations\u201d and to protect its source and methods. Attorney General William Barr asserted the state secrets privilege to keep the other information secret, saying there was a \u201creasonable danger\u201d that releasing it would \u201crisk significant harm to national security.\u201d\n\nNearly 3,000 people were killed when terrorists crashed hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and, after passengers resisted, a field in Pennsylvania.\n\nSaudi Arabia has denied official complicity in the attacks. While 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, official U.S. government reviews haven't made public any concrete evidence of Riyadh\u2019s involvement.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s decision comes amid broader tensions between Washington and Riyadh, through which Mr. Trump has largely stood by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe document at issue consists of a four-page 2012 summary of an FBI inquiry into three people who may have assisted two of the hijackers in California in finding housing, obtaining driver\u2019s licenses and other matters.\n\nTwo of the people, Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi, were linked to the Saudi government, according to FBI and congressional documents. The third person, whose name is redacted, is described in the summary as having tasked the other two with assisting the hijackers.\n\nLast year, lawyers for the families subpoenaed the FBI for an unredacted copy in the belief that the third person was potentially a senior Saudi official who exercised authority over both of the men.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s allies had also urged him to release the information. Days after the October 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.), a close ally of the president, met in Washington with Prince Khalid bin Salman, younger brother of Prince Mohammed. Mr. Gaetz called on him to produce documents in the court case and \u201cmake right the loss of the 9/11 families,\u201d Mr. Gaetz said.\n\nAt the time the prince, known as KBS, was serving as Saudi ambassador to the U.S., but he was recalled to the kingdom amid outrage over the killing. The CIA said in a secret assessment last year that it had medium-to-high confidence that Prince Mohammed probably ordered Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nThat has put Mr. Trump in a bind given his desire to maintain ties with the Saudi government, which he has said is an important ally and supports the U.S. defense industry with billions in arms purchases.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s official involvement in the planning of the 9/11 attacks is the subject of some dispute. The 9/11 Commission said in its 2004 report it didn\u2019t find evidence that Mr. al-Thumairy had provided assistance.\n\nIt also said it had seen \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that Mr. al-Bayoumi \u201cbelieved in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist groups.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the 9/11 commission revisited the issue and assessed more recent evidence regarding Messrs. al-Thumairy and al-Bayoumi, and said it didn\u2019t find the new information enough to change the original findings. It said there was an \u201congoing internal debate\u201d within the FBI about the potential significance of some of the information, and encouraged FBI leadership to continue the investigation accordingly.\n\nAttorneys for the victims\u2019 families argued that the two men had provided support to two hijackers in a \u201chighly coordinated, state-run-and-initiated covert operation,\u201d and filed affidavits written by former FBI officials over the past two years supporting their position.\n\nThe alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, opened the door in July to helping victims of the attacks in their lawsuit against Saudi Arabia if the U.S. government spares him the death penalty at a Guantanamo Bay military commission.\n\n\u2014 Alex Leary contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration turned over a key piece of new information to lawyers for 9/11 victims\u2019 families, a move that could cast light on long-disputed reports of Saudi government involvement in the attacks.", "authors": ["Sadie Gurman", "Aruna Viswanatha", "Sadie.Gurman Wsj.Com", "Aruna.Viswanatha Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106584/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
