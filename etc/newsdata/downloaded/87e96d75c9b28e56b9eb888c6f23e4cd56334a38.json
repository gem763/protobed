Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY\u2019s editor-in-chief, said the reporting was as ambitious as it was unprecedented.\n\n\u201cThe story at times is overwhelming, but so is what is taking place at our border,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cAs journalists, we say all the time, 'show, don't tell.' Our goal was to transport our readers to scenes of the crisis, not just tell them what happened.\"\n\nWith concurrent reporting from four countries, eight states and across the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, \u201cThe Migrants\u201d reveals a system on the brink of collapse. It witnesses families facing death, and traces the influx to its roots, the decades-old challenges in Central American countries that are now exacerbated by new American policies.\n\n\u201cThe Migrants\u201d distinguishes itself from previous coverage of immigration, both in its timing and its scope. What's happening in immigration in America is not happening in single moments \u2013 it\u2019s happening all the time, a torrent of movement and conflict that the USA TODAY NETWORK is uniquely poised to capture.\n\n\u201cThis project crosses both physical and language barriers to share stories that will help people understand the breadth of this crisis and encourage discussions about its consequences and solutions,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cI am so proud of the team of journalists who remained committed to working so hard on this project well beyond the week-long effort on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe reporting effort meant deploying more than two dozen journalists across the continent. For a week, they watched migrants prepare to leave Central America; crossed rivers and waited at military checkpoints in Mexico; found desperation in shelters in Mexico City and at the border; followed Border Patrol agents as they found families and children in the backcountry; and traveled by bus and plane with families who had been released to make their own way into the United States.\n\nFrom June 24 to 30, the teams from across the USA TODAY NETWORK traveled more than 20,000 miles, including to the highlands of Guatemala, the National Palace in Mexico City, both sides of the border from California to Texas, immigration courts in Los Angeles and the lawmaking chambers of Washington, D.C.\n\nField reporting is the centerpiece of a project that also draws on years of data and policy expertise. \u201cThe Migrants\u201d reveals that the crisis is much broader and violent than has been previously reported; it is resulting in deaths, trauma, violence, crime and previously untold costs. Reporters reveal how much local tax money American cities now spend caring for migrants the federal government abandons. And they trace the roots of the surge, in part, to a crackdown on the heroin trade.\n\n\u201cThe Migrants\u201d, with its unique combination of investigative reporting and real-world narrative, leverages some of the same journalistic talent behind USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning project \u201cThe Wall: Untold Stories, Unintended Consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wall,\u201d which examined Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, won the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting. \u201cThe Wall\u201d was led by The Arizona Republic and other newsrooms along the border where journalists have personal connections and decades of experience covering the topic. Journalists from local news sites and USA TODAY collaborated on \u201cThe Migrants,\u201d combining their expertise and deep experience in covering immigration issues to deliver a report that should resonate with national and international audiences.\n\nThe full findings of the report, including a documentary video with in-depth interviews, can be found at themigrants.usatoday.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/10/04/usa-today-network-publishes-comprehensive-project-immigration-the-migrants-following-its-unprecedent/3867930002/", "description": "Nearly 30 journalists spent seven days reporting from key locations at the center of America's migrant crisis for \"The Migrants\" project.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
