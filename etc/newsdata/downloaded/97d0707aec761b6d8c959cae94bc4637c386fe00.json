He's still in the hospital. All campaign events canceled until further notice. There are now obvious questions about whether a 78-year-old can endure months of exhausting campaigning.\n\nEarlier this week, he held seven back-to-back events in New Hampshire. Tuesday night, the chest pains began. Another obvious question is whether voters will accept him as a potential president.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe other front runner is Joe Biden and he may be the first casualty of impeachment. He is collateral damage. All the attention given to the Ukraine core has brought back the questions about Hunter Biden and the money he received in Ukraine and China. This is already showing up in the latest polls.\n\nA plurality of voters believes Mr. Trump's allegations against Biden, and Biden has slipped to second place in some key states. It all happened so quickly, didn't it? But as of now, it's Elizabeth Warren's nomination to lose. That's my opinion.\n\nNext question. Could she win a presidential election? My opinion, no \u2014 for two reasons.\n\nFirst: policy. I just don't believe America will elect a president, someone who wants to destroy our economic system. Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. Her proposals would destroy capitalism and, with it, the prosperity we enjoy today.\n\nSecond: her demeanor. The way she comes across. Anger is Sen. Warren's frequent theme. Hating capitalism, the rich, the billionaires, Wall Street, it plays well to socialists, but on your screens, every day for four years, anger is not so attractive. You've got to be good on TV to win these days.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nYes, of course, it's very early, but there's not much time left for moderate Democrats to make much of a showing. Far-left Warren is now very likely to be the nominee and, outside California and New York, Democrats \u2014 again, my opinion \u2014 should be very worried.", "description": "FOX Business' Stuart Varney gives his take on how the presidential nomination is Elizabeth Warren's to lose.", "authors": ["Stuart Varney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/74d073fe-elizabeth-warren-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
