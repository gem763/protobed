Now he will be living just up the road from the playground (above) frequented by children of the same age\n\nDespite pleas from the father of the young boy who Hill abused, the WA parole board allowed him to walk free after serving the minimum period of his sentence.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the parole board cited that Hill would be facing seven strict conditions once out in the community.\n\nThese include having no contact with the victim or his ex-boyfriend Lindner, as well as not being in the presence of any boy under 18 without supervision.\n\nThey also cited that Hill had taken a number of steps to rehabilitate himself behind bars, including completing a sex offenders program.\n\nWhile Hill will be monitored until the end of his parole period, he is not regarded as a high-risk offender and so will not be under close surveillance.\n\nBut the victim's father claimed in a letter to the parole board that this was not good enough.\n\nHill will be forced to abide by seven strict conditions, but the victim's father and WA politician Peter Katsambanis (pictured) believe he should be put under closer watch\n\n'He's a child rapist, he's part of a two man sex ring, he does the minimum jail and they put him back to swing into our community and everyone just has to get on with it,' the father said.\n\nWA state politician Peter Katsambanis is among those calling for Hill to be put under closer watch, saying it was important to protect young and vulnerable children.\n\n'He is supposedly not to have any contact with children under 18, yet here he is,' Mr Katsambanis said.\n\n'He can look out his window and see these children.'", "description": "Peter Wallace Hill (pictured) walked free from prison earlier this month, two years after he was jailed for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy in southern Western Australia in 2017.", "authors": ["Josh Hanrahan For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19855184-0-image-a-55_1571342497378.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
