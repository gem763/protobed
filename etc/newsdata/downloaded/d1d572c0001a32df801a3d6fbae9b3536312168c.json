After all, we get to use a lot of services and platforms on the Internet for free, and they need to support themselves somehow. The problem arises though when the ads are all up in your face.\n\nMirriad\n\nTake for instance the ever-present ad banners on a lot of websites. They're the sole reason the people that make ad blockers even have a product to sell. And then of course are also the autoplay videos, and unskippable ads between YouTube clips. A lot of people don't mind ads, they get that it's unavoidable. But to actually make your ad unavoidable is really distasteful.\n\nWhich is why there's a tweet that's been going viral since yesterday, that people are sharing because they're both amazed and, in some cases, appalled. It shows what looks like ads being digitally inserted into TV movies and series, the same way you would visual effects. And that's struck up a bit of a conversation.\n\nWow! Worth watching this. China's largest video platform #Tencentvideo (97M paying China subscribers) will begin inserting extra ads into movies/series that didn't exist in the original. #computervision pic.twitter.com/qltsQz9jdF \u2014 Matthew Brennan (@mbrennanchina) October 15, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 2.8 K SHARES\n\nThe tweet, which was posted by Chinese tech expert Matthew Brennan, is actually demo footage from a UK-based firm Mirriad. They call themselves a \"computer vision and AI-powered platform company\". It's basically a fancy way of saying they use AI techniques to forward their marketing campaigns for clients.\n\nThis particular technique being demonstrated here is actually similar to how the infamous deepfakes works, except instead of switching faces it's adding in branding.\n\nMirriad\n\nThe AI here has two purposes. First, it uses market research data to determine what scenes brand placement can appear in without looking out of place, how big it should be, what prominence can be given to it, and so on. For instance, the AI might determine that the best placement in one scene is a mini billboard in the back of the store, and for another that it should be a browser ad on a laptop in the coffee shop.\n\nThe computer vision part of the program then helps insert the ad placement in a natural way, blending it in with the scene so it's not jarring. And according to Mirriad, case studies show this system really works for their clients. Which is why they've just signed a deal with Tencent, China's largest content broadcaster for online.\n\nThe thing is, you may have actually been exposed to this technology before without even realising it. You see, one of Mirriad's case studies for this system was with a Star Plus show called 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai'. It's likely the ad wasn't implemented on TV, but rather if you watched it through Hotstar.\n\nMirriad\n\nHonestly, I'm personally a little torn on this sort of advertising. Logistically, it's way better than current methods, because it means you won't have to deal with frequent interruptions of your shows to be forced to watch a video ad. However, maybe that's better than being jarred out of your immersion by odd placements.\n\nIt all depends on how good the AI really is. After all, seeing an ad for Freshwrapp when you're watching a futuristic show could be really off-putting. But it's possible this algorithm could learn enough over time to avoid doing things like that. In which case, though this seems distasteful now, it could eventually turn out to be the lesser evil.\n\nMirriad\n\nAnd what will happen to ad blockers? Well who knows, maybe they'll fall by the wayside as people feel less of a need to block advertisements. Then again, maybe they'll find a way to bypass even these kinds of in-video ads.\n\nIn which case we may be setting ourselves up for a dystopian future where a super smart AI takes over the world, because technically that would be an AI fighting another AI, and both getting smarter because of each other. In the meantime though, it's still pretty cool to watch it being done.", "description": "We hate ads, but they\u2019re a necessary part of our online experience.
