Here are the 5 credit cards I always keep in my wallet to optimize my spending.", "language": "en", "text": "Author Ariana Arghandewal. Courtesy of Ariana Arghandewal\n\nBefore I got involved in the points and miles hobby, I had just one credit card, issued by Capital One. It earned just 1% cash back on everything \u2014 nothing to write home about.\n\nFast-forward seven years, and I have more than a dozen credit cards, helping me earn more than 1 million points each year to help fund incredible travel experiences. Regardless of how many cards I pick up over the years, there are five that I'll always keep in my wallet to maximize my rewards.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\nThe Chase Freedom Unlimited has a lot going for it. For starters, it earns 1.5% cash back on everything. If you have another Ultimate Rewards-earning credit card (such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card), you can convert your cash-back earnings to Ultimate Rewards points. Effectively, this card earns 1.5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent, which is incredibly valuable. These points can be transferred 1:1 to partners like Hyatt, United Airlines, Southwest, JetBlue, and more.\n\nSince most credit cards only earn 1 point per dollar spent on non-bonus purchases, the Chase Freedom Unlimited's elevated earning rate makes it my go-to card for most spending that isn't eligible for category bonuses. The card also has no annual fee, which makes it a long-term keeper.\n\nRead more: Chase Freedom Unlimited card review\n\nHilton Honors American Express Aspire card\n\nIn my opinion, the Hilton Honors Aspire card from American Express is the best hotel credit card. It offers plenty of benefits like top-tier Hilton Diamond status, up to a $250 airline fee credit each year, up to a $250 Hilton resort credit each year, a $100 Hilton on-property credit on two-night stays, and Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership. Basically, this card gets me upgraded travel and saves me hundreds of dollars every year, making it easily worth the $450 annual fee.\n\nI carry the Hilton Honors Aspire card around mostly for the 7 points per dollar it earns at US restaurants. As someone who dines out quite a bit and has an out-of-control coffee habit, those 7 points really add up to significant rewards.\n\nRead more: My 5 favorite credit cards for earning rewards on dining out, no matter how much you spend\n\nOccasionally, I get to charge large food purchases to this card at work and get reimbursed. It all adds up significantly and makes those top-tier 95,000-points-per-night Hilton hotel awards much more attainable.\n\nAs a bonus, spending $60,000 on this card in a calendar year gets me a free weekend night certificate. Huge win!\n\nRead more: Hilton Honors Aspire Amex card review \u2014 why it's worth the $450 annual fee\n\nFidelity Rewards Visa\n\nThe Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature Card earns 2% cash back on all spending and carries no annual fee. I treat this card like my travel savings account and use the rewards during times when redeeming miles doesn't make sense. Sometimes airfare is too cheap to justify an award redemption, so I dip into my Fidelity account for the cash I save for these types of scenarios.\n\nSometimes I also use the cash-back rewards for Airbnb stays, tour packages, spa passes, or any travel activity that I can't redeem points and miles for. People really underestimate the value and flexibility of a 2% cash-back card. It's an important part of my points and miles strategy and I always carry this card with me for a solid return on my everyday spending.\n\nRead more: The best cash-back credit cards\n\nChase Ink Plus\n\nThe Ink Plus Business card from Chase is no longer available to new applicants, but it remains one of my go-to credit cards. The card earns 5x points on the first $50,000 spent at office supply store, which is a big spending category for me. It's why the Chase Ink Plus will always have a place in my wallet.\n\nIf you're looking for an equivalent card, the Ink Business Cash Credit Card is a great alternative. It earns 5% cash back at office supply stores (5% on combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable, and, phone services each anniversary year, then 1%) and carries no annual fee.\n\nKorean Air SkyPass Visa Signature Card\n\nYou may be scratching your heads at this one, but the Korean Air SkyPass program is an incredibly valuable rewards program. I frequently save up points to travel to Europe, and Korean Air's 80,000-mile business-class tickets are a bargain. Compare that to the 115,000-plus points most other rewards programs charge for round-trip tickets to the same destinations.\n\nSo even though the Korean SkyPass card only earns 1 mile per dollar spent on non-bonus spending, those miles go further than with other rewards programs. The Korean SkyPass Visa Signature is mostly a back-up card, but I always feel good about charging non-bonus category spending to the card.", "description": "I have more than a dozen credit cards that help me earn more than a million points each year, but just five of them are my top picks for daily spend.", "authors": ["Ariana Arghandewal"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cbaf64b6507518148824a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
