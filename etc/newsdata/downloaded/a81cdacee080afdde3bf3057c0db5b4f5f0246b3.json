The husband and wife team saved for three years before opening their first store, originally called Fashion 21. From the beginning, they centered the business on affordable, of-the-moment clothing, much of which came from wholesale closeouts that allowed the retailer to get its merchandise directly from the manufacturers at a lower cost.\n\nThat first year, it made $700,000 in sales. At its peak, in 2015, revenue exceeded $4 billion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cForever 21 gives hope and inspiration to people who come here with almost nothing,\u201d Do Won told the Los Angeles Times in 2010. \u201cAnd that is a reward that humbles me: the fact that immigrants coming to America, much like I did, can come into a Forever 21 and know that all of this was started by a simple Korean immigrant with a dream.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe company expanded rapidly from there, opening locations in dozens of countries. The stores also got bigger; the average Forever 21 store is 38,000 square feet, according to the company\u2019s website. Over time, the family-owned company also expanded beyond its core customers \u2014 teenagers and women in their 20s \u2014 by moving into men\u2019s and kids\u2019 clothing, makeup, and home decor.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when literally everything in my closet was Forever 21,\u201d said Kasey Meredith, a 25-year-old brands reporter who started shopping at Forever 21 in middle school. \u201cNow every time I go in the store, I have heart palpitations because it\u2019s so overwhelming. It\u2019s like an assault on your senses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nForever 21\u2032s aggressive expansion in the past decade coincided with seismic shifts in retail, largely brought on by Amazon. The store always faced competition from such fast-fashion rivals as H&M and Zara, but the rise of e-commerce unleashed a wave of new competitors and imitators also geared toward hip and cheap. Just 16 percent of Forever 21\u2032s sales came from e-commerce last year. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nThe company has also taken heat for the environmental and labor costs of its fast, disposable products, and that has especially hurt it as young people who make up the bedrock of its customers increasingly seek out more sustainable options.\n\n\u201cA couple of years ago, I became very conscious of how much I was consuming. I would buy seven shirts and I would give them all away after a few wears,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cNow I buy something that\u2019s higher-quality, that\u2019s not just a little Band-Aid that causes so much environmental destruction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nForever 21 has received $350 million for restructuring, which it will use to sustain normal business as it tries to \u201cright size its store base and return to the basics that allowed the company to thrive and grow,\u201d the retailer said in a news release.\n\nBut analysts said the retailer needs to take broader action if it wants to win back consumers.\n\n\u201cSlimming down the operation and reducing costs is only one part of the battle,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients. \u201cThe long-term survival of Forever 21 relies on the chain creating a sustainable and differentiated brand. This is something that will be very difficult to accomplish in a crowded and competitive sector.\n\nAD", "description": "The fast-fashion retailer will exit markets in Asia and Europe as it tries to refocus on its core business.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry", "Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tcOhwkbXKC5FUuC-v6gfqKPYbuc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I4UVOEHDJ4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
