Trump bans independent-\u00adminded journalists from press conferences, Johnson has blacklisted Channel 4 from approved interviewees.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nMost worrying of all, both are using a tried and tested formula of making voters who don\u2019t agree with them \u00addisappear from the electoral roll by aggressively pursuing a strategy of voter suppression.\n\nWe pride ourselves in having high turnouts in UK elections.\n\nBut America has seen a tightening of the screws on who goes to the polls.\n\nThe US experience shows that voters most dissuaded by extra requirements in elections are the most vulnerable.\n\nNo wonder Boris has ripped off the policy for himself.\n\nAfter suspending Parliament when it became an inconvenience, he now wishes to erase voters to stop them \u00adopposing him.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nForty different charities, including Operation Black Vote, the NUS, Age UK and Stonewall have warned against disenfranchising those who are already less likely to vote by insisting on \u00adpunitive ID requirements.\n\nThese are primarily poor, disabled and ethnically diverse people.\n\nThere are 3.5 million people who don\u2019t have any photo ID, such as a passport or driving licence. The Electoral Reform Society warns that innocent voters will be denied a say under these draconian proposals.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s a sledgehammer to crack a nut because the last election threw up only a tiny number of cases of malpractice out of millions of votes cast.\n\nNever mind Johnson being the only PM to have an indeterminate number of offspring. He is unique in being the first to have illegally suspended Parliament by lying to our 93-year-old monarch, who I\u2019m sure was not amused.\n\nWith impeachment proceedings hanging over Trump, a big fan of the Congress-bypassing executive order, the parallels abound.\n\nBoth bumbling blonds appear to have only a weak relationship with the truth and scant respect for womankind, be it \u201cgrabbing \u2019em by the pussy\u201d or pouring red wine down the sofa of a younger trade-in while still married to another woman.\n\nI will do all I can to halt these plans and turf out the Tories.\n\nBut first things first. We need to rule out no-deal now.", "description": "The Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton says unelected Prime Minister is as scared of scrutiny as his US counterpart", "authors": ["Rupa Huq", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20376477.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-President-Trump-meets-with-British-Prime-Minister-Johnson-on-sidelines-of-UN-General-Assembly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
