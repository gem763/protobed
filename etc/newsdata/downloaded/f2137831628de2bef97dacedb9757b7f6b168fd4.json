We need to talk about things.\u201d\n\nBut the \u2018keeper did not want to single out individual players for criticism.\n\n\u201cWe have to do it (talk) in private, I won\u2019t say anything here. There are things we can improve. It\u2019s an internal issue and I don\u2019t want to speak about it here,\u201d the German said. \u201cI would like to talk to my teammates on the field first.\u201d\n\nComing off a 3-0 win at Eibar in the Spanish league, Barcelona appeared in control when Lionel Messi scored just three minutes after kickoff but then found itself outhustled by Slavia.\n\nTer Stegen had to make a save with his leg to deny Jaroslav Zeleny. Moments later Ter Stegen leapt and stretched to palm Peter Olayinka\u2019s dipping shot over the bar.\n\nTer Stegen couldn\u2019t stop Jan Boril\u2019s equalizer from inside the area five minutes into the second half that was well deserved for the hosts. Messi then floated a cross to Luis Su\u00e1rez, who knocked the ball off Olayinka and into the net in the 57th to take the tougher-than-expected victory.\n\n\u201cThey leveled the score on their first attack of the second half,\u201d Ter Stegen said. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen. He was too alone. We didn\u2019t come (out for the second half) at 100%.\n\n\u201cPersonally I always want to be there if I can help the team play ever better. We saw some counterattacks when we were not well-positioned. Those things happen and that\u2019s why I am there.\u201d\n\nBarcelona has a three-point lead in a tough Group F which includes Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund. But that can\u2019t gloss over another subpar showing for Barcelona on the road.\n\nIn their Champions League opener at Dortmund, Ter Stegen stopped Marco Reus\u2019 penalty and made several other saves for Barcelona in a 0-0 draw. At home, he also blocked a point-blank header from Inter forward Lautaro Mart\u00ednez that would have doubled the Italian club\u2019s lead, before Barcelona rallied for a 2-1 win in their second match in Europe\u2019s top club competition.\n\n\u201cHe has been key in our Champions League matches,\u201d Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said.\n\nBarcelona also leads the Spanish league but it has done better at home than away, where it has two wins on the road after stumbling in its first three away fixtures.\n\nTer Stegen has excelled as Barcelona\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper after making the occasional mistake following his move from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in 2014. With impressive saves, a cool-under-fire attitude, and also crisp passing, he has helped Barcelona to win one Champions League and four Spanish league titles.\n\nThe 27-year-old keeper\u2019s consistently strong performances have even let him challenge veteran Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who has held the position for a decade.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is getting tired of coming to the rescue of his teammates.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
