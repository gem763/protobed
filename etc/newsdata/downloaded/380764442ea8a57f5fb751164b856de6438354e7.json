Including for the first time in Brisbane and Perth. While other upstart addresses are set to join the exclusive club too.\n\nLocations soon to hit the $2 million median are spread right across the country. (They can be seen in the graphic below.)\n\nIt is another indication of a resurgent property market.\n\n\u201cA suburb with a $1 million median used to be considered a premium suburb, but this is no longer the case in Sydney,\u201d REA Group chief economist Nerida Conisbee said.\n\n\u201cIn Sydney, even $2 million is unlikely to get you into a premium suburb. with Rosebery, a previously industrial suburb close to Sydney airport likely to hit that level over the next couple of years, perhaps earlier.\n\n\u201cBrisbane isn\u2019t too far from having its first $2 million suburb with Teneriffe about to hit that level. Unlike Rosebery, Teneriffe is one of Brisbane\u2019s best suburbs. The premium market in Perth continues to pick up \u2014 Swanbourne has increased by 17.4 per cent over the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cIf the premium market recovery continues in Perth, it is likely to hit $2 million over a similar time frame to Rosebery.\n\nSydney\u2019s new upstart suburbs\n\nRosebery\u2019s evolution from an industrial suburb to one much more liveable, has allowed it to blossom as a desirable location, said Simon Cohen, a buyer\u2019s agent from Cohen Handler.\n\n\u201cRosebery has been gentrified and it\u2019s become a very nice place to live,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of young families have moved into the area.\n\n\u201cKogarah Bay has also really grown as a suburb. It\u2019s waterfront locations is one of its big drawcards. It\u2019s very close to the hospital (St George Hospital) and as such a lot of doctors like to call it home.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago houses in Mount Druitt started getting $1 million and they are popular for similar reasons to Kogarah Bay \u2014 the access to amenities, they are near a Westfield or a hospital. Areas like that always have that good growth.\u201d\n\nMr Cohen\u2019s counterpart in Brisbane, Jordan Navybox said Teneriffe was the most desired suburb in Brisbane.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the top of the list for our buyers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right by the river and close to the city. There are some incredible new builds there in terms of boutique residential homes.\n\n\u201cIn the late 1990s houses were going for $300,000 to $400,000. Now they are going up to 10 times that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very highly sought after and there is very little stock. There is a lot of interest whenever a property comes up for sale. People have come to us, to help them buy after looking for two years. On average it\u2019s a four to six week buying process for us but the average process for Teneriffe is longer than other suburbs.\n\nPortsea on the comeback\n\n\u201cPortsea has been a millionaire\u2019s playground since Adam was a boy,\u201d said seller\u2019s agent\n\nRob Curtain from Peninsula Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\nBut after something of a lull and a loss of status to neighbouring Sorrento, it is enjoying a resurgence.\n\n\u201cPortsea has definitely picked up in the last 18 months,\u201d Mr Curtain continued.\n\n\u201cAbout 10 years ago people started moving to Sorrento, but now they are saying it is overpopulated, it is overly busy and they want to come back.\n\n\u201cPortsea has larger blocks of land than Sorrento, so you can get those bigger sales. But there are also less houses, which means less turnover.\n\n\u201cYou have both the ocean and the bay beaches. So you have the best of both worlds. It\u2019s also at the end of the road, the southern end of the peninsula. So it\u2019s quieter.\u201d\n\nMr Curtain currently has a five bedroom house on 2,733 sq m on Elizabeth Rd, Portsea for sale.\n\n\u201cPreviously it was for sale with another agent at 2.5, that was too much. It will sell in the low 2s, we have had a lot of interest.\u201d\n\nThe jewel in Perth\u2019s crown\n\nPrices in the Perth property market have slumped 19 per cent since the city\u2019s peak in March 2014. That is the deepest fall of any capital city except Darwin, where prices have slumped 28 per cent since their June 2014 peak.\n\nMORE: V8 Supercar star\u2019s home up for sale\n\nThe Aussie suburbs Hong Kong buyers are targeting\n\nHowever there are signs the premium end of the Perth market may help to pull it up, mirroring what is occurring in the Sydney market.\n\nThe exclusive suburb of Swanbourne has almost made up that 19 per cent fall over the last 12 months. As such it is set to become the first Perth suburb to boast a $2 million median house price.\n\n\u201cThere has always been consistent demand for premium addresses in Perth,\u201d sales agent Pam Herron from The Agency said.", "description": "It\u2019s no longer enough to be a millionaire to own property in the suburbs.
