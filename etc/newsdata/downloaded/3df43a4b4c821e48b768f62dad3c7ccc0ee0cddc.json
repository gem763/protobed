They battled. The intensity grows as we get deeper into October, just the intent and the certainty on the approaches, the focus on the pitches continues to just raise across the board. So you have to respond to that.\u201d\n\nCole must raise his level again now that Washington batters are more familiar with the array of siders, curves, changeups and fastball pitches he will use to try and baffle them.\n\n\u201cI expect them to be good and they are really good,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThere are always challenges involved in that. Anticipate having to respond to some things and hopefully we respond well.\u201d\n\nCole hasn\u2019t changed his basic strategy from a season in which he went 20-5.\n\n\u201cMy game plan isn\u2019t to go in and strike out 13-14 guys a game. My game plan is to try to execute the pitches,\u201d Cole said.\n\n\u201cIf I execute them at a high level and pick the right ones at the right times, my stuff allows me to get swing and miss. If you\u2019re a team, that doesn\u2019t do that, maybe you just swing and miss less.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals were patient in the first two games, young slugger Juan Soto saying he would wait until Cole threw a fastball to make a swing.\n\n\u201cI would expect him to be looking for a fastball after the first at-bat,\u201d Cole said.\n\nCole, a free agent after the Series, is expected to command the top deal ever signed by a major league pitcher, currently $217 million by David Price, and he might pass teammate Zack Greinke\u2019s record for annual value at $34.4 million, especially with the big-spending New York Yankees in the hunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about anything past the next few days,\u201d Cole said.\n\nWhether on Sunday or in a possible seventh-game appearance, Cole plans to exhaust himself in hopes of getting the Astros a second crown in three seasons.\n\n\u201cI hope I go home with nothing left in the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m absolutely dog tired by the time I get home.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Mad Max\u2019 set to battle \u2013\n\nHis Washington counterpart, Scherzer, struck out seven and walked three over five innings, surrendering two runs on five hits in winning the opener.\n\nThe 35-year-old right-hander nicknamed \u201cMad Max\u201d is a three-time Cy Young Award winner as best pitcher and led the National League in strikeouts from 2016-2018.\n\n\u201cAfter the first game, he sat down and mapped out his game plan for the next game. He\u2019s all in,\u201d Nats manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nPatient Houston hitters forced Scherzer to throw 112 pitches over five innings and figure to test him once again.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t chase,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to attack the strike zone. We need to be aggressive, but aggressive in the strike zone.\u201d\n\nScherzer is ready for whatever Houston batters bring in only their second meeting with Scherzer in more than two years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only advantage is I don\u2019t face the Houston Astros that much. I could execute better and give their hitters a little bit different look.\n\n\u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s always going to be a battle.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Houston ace pitcher Gerrit Cole tries to avenge his only loss since May when he faces a rematch against Washington\u2019s Max", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/a114c5_washington-pitcher-max-scherzer-start-game-world-series-host-nationals-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
