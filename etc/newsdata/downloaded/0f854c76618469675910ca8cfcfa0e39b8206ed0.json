Not one, but three!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she played through like a champion.\u201d\n\nFitting how the year Elena Delle Donne won her first WNBA title, she was not only playing hurt, but more hurt than the public ever knew.\n\nDelle Donne injured her back last week in Game 2 of the WNBA Finals and missed most of the game. With four days off before Game 3, she was able to return for the Washington Mystics and play the remainder of the series.\n\nBut the team said her diagnosis was \u201ca small disk herniation,\u201d not three of them.\n\nDelle Donne has played in three WNBA Finals and has never been 100% healthy for any of them. In 2014, playing for the Chicago Sky, she suffered a back injury in the first round and was not herself throughout the final series. Last year with Washington, it was a bone bruise in her knee suffered in the semis that hindered her in the finals.\n\nAfter falling short both years, Delle Donne lifted the championship trophy for the first time when the Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun in Game 5 Thursday, 89-78.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve contemplated long hours over why, every time I get to a finals, something happens,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s because I pissed the basketball gods off years ago when I decided to step away. So I\u2019m hoping this ends this little drama that I\u2019ve been having in the finals.\u201d\n\nShe was referring to the year she walked away from a basketball scholarship at the University of Connecticut to attend the University of Delaware \u2014 and played volleyball for one season before returning to hoops.\n\nDelle Donne transferred to Delaware to be closer to her family. She requested a trade from Chicago to Washington for the same reason. Delle Donne\u2019s sister, Lizzie, suffers from cerebral palsy, autism, blindness and deafness. The league MVP has always called her sister an inspiration, and that\u2019s especially relevant when she\u2019s had to fight through injuries.\n\n\u201cAnother reason I can battle through issues \u2014 she\u2019s been dealt the worst cards possible with her disabilities, and every day she gets up, she smiles, she laughs, she loves,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI was talking to her all game long. Trying to have them miss free throws, I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, Liz, give me a little something.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t know it. She doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m a basketball player. But she\u2019s been my biggest motivator, and she\u2019s brought me here and she\u2019s brought me to this moment.\u201d\n\nWhile Delle Donne\u2019s big sister motivated her, she in turn motivated her teammates with her ability to grind through her pain in the most important series of their careers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important because when you\u2019re talking about playing for the players to the left and to the right of you and being a leader on this team and being one of the captains and pushing through to win us a championship, that\u2019s a huge testament to both her and Ariel [Atkins] in this last series,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cAgain, thank you, Della.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
