A six-time Pro Bowler with Tampa Bay and fixture in the community, the Buccaneers didn\u2019t want to pay the $13 million salary McCoy had been due for this season, so he was gone.\n\nAfter parting ways with McCoy, the Bucs signed Ndamukong Suh, older than McCoy and not exactly known for his charitable works, to a one-year contract with a max value of $10 million.\n\nOn Sunday in London, the two players were on the same field.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMcCoy off to strong start\n\nMcCoy had 1.5 sacks in the first half of the game for Carolina, taking down his former teammate Jameis Winston.\n\nThough they are his first sacks of the season for the Panthers, he\u2019s still doing more for his new team \u2013 and in fewer snaps \u2013 than Suh is doing for the Buccaneers.\n\nMcCoy has been starting and playing roughly two-thirds of the defensive snaps for Carolina; Suh has been on the field for over three-quarters of Tampa Bay\u2019s defensive snaps and has yet to record a sack. Suh did have a fumble recovery for a touchdown on September 29 against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Panthers led 17-7 at the half at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nUpdate: McCoy got another sack of Winston in the fourth quarter, giving him 2.5; it was his most productive game since 2013, when he had three sacks of another NFC South foe, Atlanta\u2019s Matt Ryan.\n\nCarolina's Gerald McCoy had 1.5 first-half sacks against his former team, Tampa Bay.
