Captain Gareth Rees and Rod Snow were ejected after a fight-filled loss to South Africa in 1995. Flanker Dan Baugh was red-carded at the 1999 tournament for stamping in a game against Namibia.", "description": "Canadian forward Josh Larsen has been handed a three-match ban in the wake of his red card against South Africa at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316293.1570723368!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/larsen-josh-101019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
