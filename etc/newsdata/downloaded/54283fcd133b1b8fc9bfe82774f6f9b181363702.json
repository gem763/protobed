Humans have mixed faunas and floras globally, lopped branches from the tree of life, and greatly increased the abundance of selected species. Even if we avoid another mass extinction, we have already deflected future biological history. Human-caused changes to Earth systems are also no blip. Industrially generated CO2 already in the atmosphere (about a trillion tons, and rising) will likely eliminate the next glacial phase altogether, changing ocean chemistry and climate history for hundreds of thousands of years to come. Human shaping of landscapes is even more durable. The subterranean roots of cities\u2014subway tunnels, pilings, millions of boreholes\u2014are buried deep below the reach of erosion and set to last far longer than dinosaur bones. Even eroded material does not vanish mysteriously from the planet\u2014it simply accumulates elsewhere to form distinctive, preservable strata rich in concrete, plastics fragments, metal alloys, composite materials, synthetic organic pollutants, and other geochemical fingerprints of industrial civilization. Radioisotopes from atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons may decay with time, but do not disappear. They reconfigure to new isotopes that will show a permanent, discernible spike. The Anthropocene already has a far more striking set of durable sedimentary markers than many other geological epochs.\n\nBrannen insists that \u201cthe idea of the Anthropocene inflates our own importance by promising eternal geological life to our creations.\u201d But the Anthropocene promises nothing of this kind\u2014it merely recognizes reality. Its essence comes not from Ozymandias but from Faulkner: \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d The Anthropocene epoch is not hubris: It\u2019s simply a recognition of the geologically long shadow cast by what we have already done. That recognition is the first step in learning to mold the planetary future thoughtfully rather than accidentally. That\u2019s certainly no joke\u2014a point upon which Brannen might agree.\n\nScott Wing, Jan Zalasiewicz, Colin Waters, John McNeill, Will Steffen, Erle Ellis, Naomi Oreskes, Michael Wagreich, Daniel DeB.
