The broadcaster RT\u00c9 quoted an Irish government source saying Johnson\u2019s deal, as reported on Tuesday evening, would not be acceptable to Dublin.\n\nHowever, DUP sources have confirmed that the party is largely \u201ccontent\u201d with the proposals, which are believed to still include a lot of elements of the backstop \u2013 a major concession for the party.\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nOne central element of the proposals is expected to be a \u201cStormont lock,\u201d giving local parties a say on any future proposals to keep the region aligned to EU rules and maintain an invisible border with the Republic of Ireland if Britain decided to diverge from European standards on goods and food.\n\nAlso crucial is the reestablishment of a newly empowered British-Irish ministerial council which was set up under the Belfast/Good Friday agreement but has not sat for three years. The restored council would give representatives from Stormont and the Irish parliament oversight on the future regulatory regime on the island of Ireland.\n\nIn his speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister will outline what he will call a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d, which Downing Street says has been drawn up after 70 hours of discussions with other EU member states.\n\nHe will insist that if the EU27 fails to engage with his proposals, he will press ahead with a no-deal Brexit at the end of October.\n\nBrussels has warned there will be a cold reception if the offer resembles draft proposals leaked on Monday, which would involve customs clearance sites five to 10 miles from the Irish border \u2013 later denied by Johnson.\n\nOne EU source said: \u201cPerhaps they realise if it\u2019s anything that looks like what was floated in this leak, it is going to go down like a bucket of sick.\u201d\n\nNo 10 briefed EU capitals on Tuesday on its controversial proposals and the plans are due to be published in full on Wednesday\n\nNorthern Ireland would not stay in the EU\u2019s customs territory, as Johnson explained on Tuesday in a round of media interviews, meaning there would be two borders for four years.\n\nJohnson told the BBC: \u201cIf the EU is going to insist on customs checks as we come out as it is, then we will have to accept that reality. And there will have to be a system, for customs checks away from the border. Now, we think those checks can be absolutely minimal and non-intrusive and won\u2019t involve new infrastructure.\u201d\n\nToday at the Conservative party conference Read more\n\nThe move by the UK to align with full EU regulations on goods for a period of four years has been privately welcomed by the EU member states.\n\nThe four-year time limit will dismay the Irish government, however. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has repeatedly said such a time limit would be no better for Ireland than a no-deal today, given the uncertainty that would be created for the north-south economy.\n\nThe UK\u2019s insistence that Northern Ireland will not stay in the EU\u2019s customs territory, and that extra customs checks and controls would be required on the island of Ireland, is another major red line crossed for Dublin.\n\nOne source said the British-Irish council would be a \u201cbig part of moving along\u201d the part of the backstop that was unattractive to the DUP \u2013 a regulatory barrier down the Irish Sea. It also would be a \u201cdouble lock\u201d on any move by Northern Ireland to diverge from EU rules applying in the republic.\n\n\u201cWe need a mechanism so that the future relationship is not just left to London and Brussels,\u201d said one insider. \u201cA north-south ministerial council allows us to work things out between us.\u201d\n\nThe proposals \u201cdeal with a lot of the issues the backstop was designed to deal with,\u201d said a source close to the secret talks. \u201cEveryone wants a deal. The DUP wants a deal, Dublin wants a deal, we want a deal. We are hopeful. It doesn\u2019t mean we have the cake, but we are hoping we have the ingredients for one.\u201d\n\nHowever, the proposals risk a legal challenge in Ireland as the Withdrawal Act 2019 bars any new infrastructure including customs checks on the border that did not exist before Brexit.\n\nJohnson will tell the conference that even remainers now want to \u201cmove on\u201d \u2013 a finding from recent focus groups. \u201cVoters are desperate for us to focus on their other priorities,\u201d he will say.\n\nCabinet ministers are bullish about the prospects of securing a deal before the 17 October European council \u2013 but sketchy about the details.\n\nOne told the Guardian they feared any bid to circumvent the Benn Act forbidding him leaving on Halloween without a deal would ultimately result in the supreme court forcing Johnson\u2019s hand, but that by determinedly dubbing it the \u201csurrender bill\u201d, he had driven home the message that any delay would not be his fault.\n\nHowever, Johnson will insist again on Wednesday that he will not budge from the Halloween deadline. \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done on 31 October so in 2020 our country can move on,\u201d he will say.\n\nThe government has also opened up communications channels to Labour MPs in recent days in the hope that some who fear the consequences of a second referendum could yet support a Brexit agreement.\n\nAt a DUP reception, the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, put on a show of unity with Johnson whose speech was greeted with chants of \u201cBoris, Boris\u201d and \u201cno surrender\u201d.\n\nShe said the return of devolution to Northern Ireland was \u201ccritically important\u201d and added: \u201cI know a lot of people out there who want to get on with their lives, who are sick, sore and tired of listening to Brexit. They want to get Brexit done \u2026 we want to see an agreement reached.\u201d\n\nAfter his speech, Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend this is going to be easy. This is not a walk in the park but we have made huge progress and I hope very much that in the course of the next two days we are going to get there.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson faces moment of truth for Brexit deal Read more\n\nHe said that after getting Brexit done, he wanted to put Jeremy Corbyn into a \u201cfigurative rocket\u201d and \u201cput him into orbit where he belongs\u201d, with one audience member heckling with a violent suggestion that the Labour leader should face a \u201cnoose\u201d.\n\nAs well as outlining his plans for a Brexit deal, Johnson will draw up battle lines for the general election \u2013 including seeking to bracket Labour with the Scottish National party, a move the Tories used successfully against Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour party in 2015.\n\nJohnson has also been keen to change the subject to domestic policy. There were some suggestions in Manchester that he could unveil a headline-grabbing tax cut on Wednesday to distract attention from the details of the backstop plan.", "description": "Boris Johnson agrees pact with Northern Irish party as details emerge of \u2018two borders\u2019 plan", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Lisa O'Carroll", "Heather Stewart", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627c213f9ab892a178eeda257280105c4af20a7c/0_57_2961_1777/master/2961.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3d9b7f0c5932d9484d0f019e5e3069a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
