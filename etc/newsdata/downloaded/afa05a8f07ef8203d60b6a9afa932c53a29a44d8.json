These skills can lead to better behavior on the playground, better focus in the classroom and the ability to resolve conflicts in constructive ways.\n\nParents are critical in developing and modeling these skills for their children, but many adults were never taught the basics of emotional intelligence. Instead, they may have inherited a legacy of unhealthy coping strategies, such as yelling, suppression or avoidance, and now they are at risk of passing those emotional patterns down to their children, says psychologist Marc Brackett, founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrackett says thinking about our emotions doesn\u2019t mean obsessing over every mood or slight. Rather, it means you have the tools to get through difficult moments, to learn from them and to move beyond them in healthy ways. The good news, he says, is these skills can be taught, and it\u2019s never too late to learn them.\n\nIn Brackett\u2019s new book, \u201cPermission to Feel: Unlocking the Power of Emotions to Help Our Kids, Ourselves and Our Society Thrive,\u201d he outlines the RULER approach (Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling, Expressing and Regulating emotions), a strategy developed by researchers at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. This method has been implemented at more than 2,000 schools and has helped thousands of families identify their emotions and respond to those feelings in healthy, productive ways. Here he breaks down five steps parents can take to practice these skills at home.\n\nRecognize emotions. Emotional intelligence begins by learning how to accurately recognize emotions in ourselves and others. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re picking your son up from school and you notice he is pouting and his energy is low, says Brackett. Just noticing that he\u2019s in this emotional state \u2014 and being aware of how you\u2019re reacting to it \u2014 is the first step. Brackett and his colleague Robin Stern have developed a Mood Meter App that includes hundreds of \u201cfeelings\u201d words and strategies to help kids and adults recognize emotions and cope with them in healthy ways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnderstand the source. Next, try to get to the underlying cause of the emotion without jumping to assumptions, says Brackett. Like a detective, ask questions that go deeper than what\u2019s being said: \u201cWhy do you think you felt that way?\u201d Listen for clues and look for common patterns. For example, if a child is complaining that something is unfair, then he is likely feeling anger. If a child is struggling with unmet expectations, then she is likely dealing with disappointment.\n\nLabel them accurately. Brackett says neuroscience supports the notion that \u201cif you can name it, you can tame it.\u201d Possessing a nuanced and specific vocabulary around emotions, what researchers call \u201cemotional granularity,\u201d has been found to be its own form of regulation. Prompt children to move beyond simple labels like sad or mad. Are they annoyed, disappointed or frustrated instead? Being able to accurately describe how we are feeling is an important way to get our needs met, says Brackett.\n\nExpress them. There\u2019s a bias in our society toward displaying positive emotions and suppressing negative ones. Ask yourself if you\u2019re regularly expressing a full range of emotions, even tough ones like frustration and guilt, in front of your children, says Brackett. When parents are honest about their feelings (within reason), it gives children permission to express their emotions freely, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegulate responses. Emotion regulation is the most challenging of the five steps and the most cognitively demanding. For parents of young children, Brackett suggests introducing \u201cpositive self-talk\u201d as a useful coping strategy in difficult moments. For example, when feeling frustrated, a parent might say out loud, \u201cDaddy can do this! First, I\u2019m going to take a breath to calm down.\u201d For teens, teaching them how to reframe negative situations through a more positive lens can be a helpful strategy (\u201cMaybe she was short with you because she\u2019s stressed out about the tryouts?\u201d).\n\nAs parents know, it\u2019s not what we say but what we do that matters most. Even mild-mannered adults can struggle to keep emotions in check when they are tired or overwhelmed. When emotions are running high, Brackett suggests parents take a \u201cmeta-moment.\u201d That involves hitting the pause button, taking a breath to slow down our fight-or-flight response, and then asking: How would my \u201cbest self\u201d respond in this situation? In other words, how would an ideal parent \u2014 one who is kind, warm and patient \u2014 respond right now? A useful exercise for defining your best self is to fast-forward 20 years and think about how you want your kids to remember you, says Brackett. Then ask yourself if you\u2019re earning that reputation at home.\n\n\u201cResponding through the lens of our best self helps us to choose more helpful strategies,\u201d says Brackett. In fact, he adds: \u201cJust thinking about our reputations can prompt us to behave in better ways than we might otherwise.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBest-self exercises work for kids too. Children can think of adjectives or even an image of who their best self is in the classroom, on the playground or with their siblings, and then parents can remind them of that when needed. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to be our best selves all the time, but it\u2019s something we can aspire to.\n\nJennifer Breheny Wallace is a freelance writer and the mother of three children.
