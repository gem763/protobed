Democrats should stop calling him one.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nPresident Trump is a horrendous racist. And it\u2019s time for Democrats to stop calling him one.\n\nCounterintuitive? Yes. But substantial evidence shows that labeling Trump \u201cracist\u201d backfires against Democrats. It energizes his supporters without providing any additional motivation to Democrats, and it drives soft partisans \u2014 voters who could be up for grabs in 2020 \u2014 into Trump\u2019s arms.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean letting Trump off the hook for being the racist he obviously is; I\u2019ve been using the term for four years because it objectively describes him. But this means talking about his racism in a different way:\n\nSay that he tears America apart by race and threatens our democracy.\n\nSay that he pits Americans against each other by color and religion to distract from his cruelty.\n\nSay that he enables and encourages white supremacists.\n\nDemocrats have a moral obligation to call out Trump\u2019s racist campaign. But they can\u2019t cry \u201cracist\u201d and assume that\u2019s the end of the argument.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018racist\u2019 itself has taken on this new meaning,\u201d says Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina, author of the 2019 book \u201cWhite Identity Politics.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s become a politicized term. . . . Crying racism is seen as crying wolf.\u201d In research done during the 2016 campaign, Jardina found out that when voters were read a statement saying some people oppose Trump \u201cbecause he supports racism,\u201d voters with high levels of racial resentment became overwhelmingly more supportive of Trump. Interestingly, the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d doesn\u2019t backfire the way \u201cracist\u201d does.\n\nLabeling Trump racist \u201ctends to make more racially resentful whites angry,\u201d Jardina tells me. \u201cThey hold more strongly the attitudes they have about racial policies, including doubling down on their support for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n[Sign up to receive Opinions pieces in your inbox six days a week]\n\nThese findings were confirmed in polling done by an alliance of progressive groups last month studying possible Democratic responses to Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of criminals and drug smugglers. The research found that a response calling Trump racist decreased overall support for Democrats relative to Trump. A response saying Trump uses fear to divide by race worked substantially better. The competing messages produced no major differences among Democrats and independents, but the racism response played much worse among white, non-college-educated voters and soft partisans. The racism response was especially damaging to Democrats after voters were shown an anti-immigration video with Trumpian themes. (Disclosure: My wife is a partner at the firm that conducted the polling.)\n\nThe problem with the specific term \u201cracist\u201d can be seen in yet another study done by a trio of Harvard University researchers. Writing last month on The Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog, which is written by academics, they reported that Republicans were two to three times more likely to reject the label \u201cracist\u201d for racially charged attitudes than Democrats (and most independents). Most Republicans don\u2019t regard flying the Confederate battle flag as racist for example, and a third of Republicans reject the notion that it\u2019s racist to use \u201ca word about a racial group some see as offensive.\u201d More than 80 percent of Republicans say voting for Trump is not racist.\n\nIf Democrats tell them otherwise, they\u2019ll only dig in deeper.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say Democrats should avoid the subject of racism. To the contrary, ignoring it could depress core Democratic voters, particularly non-white voters. \u201cPeople of color really want to see somebody go after Trump,\u201d says Christopher Sebastian Parker, a University of Washington specialist in race and politics. The key to making the attack on Trump resonate for independent voters is to make it more than name-calling. \u201cIf you say his racism is a threat to democracy and our lives as Americans, that will turn them against him,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt cannot be divorced from something more substantive: him as a threat to American identity or a threat to American institutions.\u201d\n\nSome of the Democratic presidential candidates in Thursday night\u2019s debate in Houston got it right; others fell into the \u201cracist\u201d trap.\n\nFormer congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.) was effective in saying he would \u201ccall out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker (N.J.) used the term but at least gave it context: \u201cWe know Donald Trump\u2019s a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists. The question isn\u2019t who isn\u2019t a racist. It\u2019s who is and isn\u2019t doing something about racism.\u201d\n\nBut South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg probably invited backlash when he was asked whether the people who support Trump and his immigration policy are racists. \u201cAnyone who supports this is supporting racism,\u201d he said.\n\nI agree with him. But for Democrats to talk that way is counterproductive.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Research shows the term could hurt the chances of defeating him in 2020.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
