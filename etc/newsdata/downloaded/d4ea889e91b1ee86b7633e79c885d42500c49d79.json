Stepman just wrote a book, entitled, The War on History: The Conspiracy to Rewrite America\u2019s Past (Regnery, 2019).\n\nThe book includes this quote from Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 Columbus Day celebration: \u201cChristopher Columbus\u2026.is justly admired as a brilliant navigator, a fearless man of action, a visionary who opened the eyes of an older world to an entirely new one.\u201d It would be hard to imagine hearing a politician today pay such a tribute.\n\nStepman writes, \u201cColumbus was the unwitting conduit for the creation of a future American Republic, and for that, he deserves our respect and veneration.\u201d\n\nI had the privilege of doing a TV-interview with Stepman recently. We talked about the \u201cwar on history\u201d and the \u201ccancel culture.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccancel culture\u201d holds up yesterday\u2019s heroes by today\u2019s criterion and then writes them off as unredeemable villains.\n\nVirtually no hero of yesterday is worthy by today\u2019s standards. And, of course, today\u2019s heroes will likewise be canceled one day. The revolution always consumes its own.\n\nStepman has been writing on this theme of modern iconoclasm of our heroes for awhile. A few years ago, he wrote about how radicals wanted to tear down a statue of Abraham Lincoln\u2026the slaveholder. What?!?\n\nA group of students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison demanded that the on-campus statue of Lincoln be torn down because he supposedly owned slaves. The protester-in-chief who is a native-American was quoted as saying: \u201cEveryone thinks of Lincoln as the great, you know, freer of slaves, but let\u2019s be real: He owned slaves, and as natives, we want people to know that he ordered the execution of native men\u2026Just to have him here at the top of Bascom is just really belittling.\u201d\n\nLincoln, of course, owned no slaves; his presidency freed the slaves. Regarding the claim of \u201cexecution of native men,\u201d Lincoln indeed ordered the execution of 38 Dakota leaders\u2014only after they committed criminal atrocities, massacring 490 settlers, including women and children.\n\nI see this attack on Lincoln as part of the \u201ccancel culture.\u201d I asked Jarrett, \u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of the cancel culture?\u201d\n\nHe replied, \u201cIn an era in which \u2018my truth,\u2019 is prioritized over \u2018THE truth,\u2019 cancel culture is used to silence those who disagree. It is based on a movement with much fervor and no forgiveness, intolerance in the name of tolerance.\u201d\n\nI then asked him, \u201cIf we continue down this road of \u2018cancel culture,\u2019 where will it all end?\u201d\n\nStepman responded, \u201cIt doesn't end if we don't reverse course. Cancel culture is meant to silence anyone who disagrees, who is on the \u2018wrong side of history,\u2019 as they perpetually redefine that. That mentality, if it becomes the norm, can't exist side by side with a culture that supports free speech.\u201d\n\nI also asked him, \u201cWhy does history matter?\u201d He answered, \u201cHistory matters because it puts our lives and times in context, it teaches us how other human beings dealt with the flawed and imperfect world they lived in. It teaches us about human nature. If we erase our history we will soon have no past and no future.\u201d\n\nI spoke recently with Dennis Prager, founder of PragerU, on this same theme of the importance of history. He told me, \u201cThe American past is [being] erased, except for the isolated awful moments. Kids today are learning how bad America was, but they\u2019re not learning that every country had slavery, every country killed indigenous people, because everybody who made a country often killed the people who were living there. I\u2019m not excusing it, I\u2019m just noting a fact. Where America differed is in its goodness. Badness is universal, goodness is relatively unique.\u201d\n\nStepman concludes in his book on the war against history, \u201cIf our country cherishes its past as it looks to its future, it will produce more Americans who deserve to be celebrated as greats\u2026.But if our country foolishly commits to erasing its history, it will have no future worthy of its past.\u201d\n\nI think Christopher Columbus would agree.", "description": "With another Columbus Day recently over, it is obvious that .10/16/2019 16:51:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Jerry Newcombe", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/281/8ff84c2c-064a-461c-90f9-dbf8b528b0c6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
