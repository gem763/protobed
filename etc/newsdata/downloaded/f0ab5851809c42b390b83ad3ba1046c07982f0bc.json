What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma. Getty 8/14 Adwoa Aboah @adwoaaboah British model Adwoa Aboah is no stranger to the crippling effect of depression having suffered from it herself. This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard. Blanchard was very vocal in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shootings earlier this year, talking with activists and highlighting their plight on social media.

Getty\n\nOne of this week\u2019s \u201cexclusives\u201d involved the retelling of events that took place in New Zealand more than 30 years ago. A family was devastated when a man shot two of his children and then turned the gun on himself. His wife remarried and her son is the England cricketing star Ben Stokes.\n\nBy any stretch of the imagination, retelling this story has no bearing on Stokes\u2019 career, and can only cause immense upset to his close family. He wasn\u2019t even born when it happened. Why do we need to know anything about his mother\u2019s past?\n\nStokes reacted furiously on Twitter, calling The Sun \u201cimmoral and heartless\u201d, stating: \u201cI will not allow my public profile to be used as an excuse to invade the rights of my parents, my wife, my children or other family members.\u201d His posts were viewed and liked by hundred of thousands of followers, and supported by leading sportsmen and women.\n\nThe Sun justified its story, saying they published after being approached by the killer\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage, that the events were in the public domain and reported extensively at the time. Stokes\u2019 version is rather different: he says a reporter turned up at his parents\u2019 house in in New Zealand \u201cout of the blue\u201d and the story contained inaccuracies which have caused even more distress.\n\nStokes has discovered, just like Meghan Markle did, that some people cannot be trusted not to blab and flog photos and stories about events which took place many decades ago, drawn in by silky-tongued reporters and sometimes the offer of large sums of money.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex has had to contend with a continuous drip of revelations about every aspect of her life prior to meeting Prince Harry. As she was a well known actress you might say she ought to have been prepared for the high level of interest in her past. But all the stuff about her mum and dad\u2019s relationship, and the drivel spouted by her half sister and brothers, is of no consequence.\n\nNewspapers can\u2019t justify it being \u201cin the public interest\u201d because it has no relevance to what she\u2019s doing right now, which is being a member of the royal family and trying (in her own way) to support good causes. This tittle-tattle has been bought simply because millions of us read it.\n\nBen Stokes was charged with affray in 2017 after an fight outside a nightclub. There was much speculation then about his \u201ctemperament\u201d. He was found not guilty and acquitted. Was The Sun story an attempt to try and dredge up something revelatory about his (imagined) temperament after a summer when he has played so well?\n\nWhatever the intent, it has failed spectacularly.\n\nAs for the second exercise in muckraking, Welsh rugby star Gareth Thomas revealed he co-operated with the Sunday Mirror to reveal he was HIV positive because a reporter (not from these publications) had gone to his parents earlier and informed them of his diagnosis. Thomas, who came out in 2009, said of the matter: \u201cI can never have that moment back to sit down with them and explain to them why their son is going to be OK and is going to be able to live through this and live a normal, healthy life.\u201d\n\nThomas is the first UK sports star to disclose he is HIV positive, and the reaction has been hugely supportive, but he made it clear this information would have stayed private if he had not been threatened. He said, \u201cit has got nothing to do with anyone else.\u201d\n\nHis story has seen traffic to the Terrence Higgins Trust website soar, with three times as many requests for HIV self-testing kits. This is to be applauded. Yet the original reporter (who Thomas calls \u201cevil\u201d) turned the rugby star into a poster boy for HIV testing. It is a role he has risen to with pride \u2013 but did he have a choice?\n\nIt should be everyone\u2019s right, no matter what their sexuality, to keep their medical status private and disclose that information as they see fit.\n\nI support Aids charities and the excellent work they do, but Thomas has been catapulted into a role he didn\u2019t plan for. The reason why other sporting stars have not come out and HIV positive ones have stayed silent, is because they are exercising their right to privacy. Being diagnosed HIV positive is no longer a death sentence and it\u2019s important to eradicate the misinformation and stigma attached to the condition. But each person has the right to deal with it in their own way.\n\nThe tabloid press routinely use sexuality and medical history obtained through coercion and blackmail to force well known people to open up for our entertainment \u2013 just to feed our appetite for nastiness.\n\nBy splashing Gareth\u2019s story on the front page, the Sunday Mirror could be accused of emphasising his \u201cdifferentness\u201d. Of course it was done with his cooperation \u2013 but he had no choice after that reporter knocked on his mum\u2019s front door.\n\nIn short, he was blackmailed.\n\nFleet Street long ago perfected the art of uncovering secrets that the public will pay to read.
