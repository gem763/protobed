Although it's normal to not see everything eye to eye, if you find yourself constantly annoyed about what your partner says or does \u2014 and feel the need to tell them so \u2014 it could mean you're accidentally sabotaging your relationship.\n\n\"Controlling people usually have issues with trust, and so they want to control whoever is in their lives as a way to protect themselves, but they actually set themselves up for people to betray or leave them because the pressures of being with them are too demanding or demeaning,\" Sherrie Campbell, a psychologist and marriage and family therapist, previously told Insider.\n\nMasking your criticisms as \"jokes\" can also be a sign that you're resentful, not helpful, Lisa Marie Bobby, a psychologist and marriage and family therapist, previously told Insider.\n\nYou hide how you feel when you're upset with your partner\n\nWhile constantly critiquing inconsequential issues like cucumber-slicing technique is problematic, so too is keeping mum about things that really matter, like your emotions when your partner says or does something that upsets you.\n\nBottling up your emotions likely means the problem will happen again, creating pent-up negative feelings and even resentment. Even if you think your partner knows you well enough to pick up on how you're feeling, it's not their job to play psychic medium, relationship coach David Bennett of Double Trust Dating previously told Insider.\n\n\"In strong relationships, partners are honest and assertive about expressing their needs,\" Bennett said.\n\nRead more: How to prevent wedding-planning stress from ruining the big day, according to a therapist devoted to anxious brides\n\nThe next time you don't feel quite right about something in your relationship, speak up about it rather than waiting for your partner to come to you.\n\nYou spend every waking moment with your partner\n\nSpending every minute together could be a sign you're too codependent.

After they do that, ask, \"How are things going? Are you where you want to be? Are you satisfied?\"\n\nYou can't part ways with your cell phone\n\nYour phone addiction could be ruining your relationship.

One of those times is when you're on a date with your partner.\n\nA July 2014 study in the journal Environment and Behavior found that couples who had conversations in the absence of their cell phones reported those talks being \"significantly superior\" compared to conversations they had when their phones were present.
