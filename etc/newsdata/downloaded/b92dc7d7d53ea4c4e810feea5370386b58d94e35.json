REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nThe umbrella indigenous organization CONAIE said demonstrations would continue until President Lenin Moreno withdraws last week\u2019s measure to eliminate fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cMore than 20,000 of us will be arriving in Quito to demand that the government overturn the decree,\u201d CONAIE President Jaime Vargas told a news conference, saying the mobilization would coincide with a national strike planned for Wednesday.\n\nMoreno, 66, who has abandoned his predecessor and one-time mentor Rafael Correa\u2019s leftist policies, says he will neither tolerate disorder nor overturn the fuel price hike that is part of a liberal economic reform package.\n\nInterior Minister Paula Romo told local Radio Quito detentions had risen to 477 since Thursday, mainly for vandalism, including the destruction of a dozen ambulances.\n\nIndigenous and workers\u2019 movements again blocked roads on Monday, from the Andean highlands to the Pacific coast, with stones, tires and burning branches.\n\nThe northern entry to Quito was paralyzed.\n\nPolice erected barricades around the presidential palace, closing off the downtown area while Moreno presided over a government security council meeting to assess the crisis.\n\nMORENO: \u2018I WANT TO TALK\u2019\n\nThe government says two dozen policemen have been injured in clashes with protesters, while a man died when he was hit by a car and an ambulance could not reach him through the barricades.\n\nIt said scores of indigenous protesters looted the warehouses of dairy company Parmalat Ecuador in Cotopaxi province on Monday, injuring some workers there. \u201cWe condemn aggression and looting, and any action that risks human life and public and private property,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nFlower and broccoli farms were also attacked in Cotopaxi, officials said, accusing Correa supporters of being behind the trouble.\n\nAs well as the detainees for unrest, authorities have also rounded up about 20 shopkeepers for raising food prices illegally in a knock-on effect of higher fuel costs.\n\nA state of emergency is in place.\n\nAlthough he enjoys the support of business and the military, Moreno\u2019s popularity has sunk to under 30%, compared with 70% after his 2017 election.\n\nIndigenous-led protests brought down three presidents in the years before Correa\u2019s rule.\n\nIn a national address on Sunday night, Moreno reiterated calls for dialogue. \u201cI want to talk with the indigenous brothers, with whom we share causes,\u201d he said, adding that resources would be set aside to help the poor and compensate for price rises.\n\nThe government is struggling with a large foreign debt and fiscal deficit and earlier this year reached a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund that hinges on belt-tightening reforms.\n\nSlideshow (39 Images)\n\nAs well as ending fuel subsidies, the government is trimming the state work force and planning some privatizations.
