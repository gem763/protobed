Some are celibate, because the future for children is too horrible to contemplate.\n\nThey feel betrayed by government, society and parents too stupid, and probably too late, to rescue the world from climate change. Many young people really do feel that they are the last generation \u2014 so thoroughly have they been brainwashed by the climate hoax.\n\nAn antidote to climate hysteria, that should be required reading in every high school, is \u201cWrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions\u201d by Myron Ebell and Steven Milloy (Competitive Enterprise Institute: Sept. 18, 2019). According to the authors, \u201cModern doomsayers have been predicting climate and environmental disasters since the 1960s. They continue to do so today. None of the apocalyptic predictions with due dates as of today have come true.\u201d\n\nFor example:\n\nIn 1968, Stanford University Professor Paul Ehrlich\u2019s book \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d started widespread panic among liberal scientists and the media that it was \u201calready too late\u201d to avoid worldwide famine by 1975.\n\nTo avert the overpopulation crisis, Mr. Ehrlich advised in 1967 that:\n\n\u201cThe United States is already too big, that birth control may have to be accomplished by making it involuntary and by putting sterilizing agents into staple foods and drinking water, and that the Roman Catholic Church should be pressured into going along.\u201d\n\nIn 1969, a New York Times headline predicted \u201cEveryone Will Disappear In A Cloud Of Blue Steam By 1989\u201d because of an alleged scientific consensus over impending apocalypse from environmental pollution.\n\nIn 1970, environmentalists predicted, in another newspaper headline \u201cAmerica Subject To Water Rationing By 1974 And Food Rationing By 1980.\u201d\n\nIn 1970, scientists working for NASA and the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research warned of an impending New Ice Age by the year 2000.\n\nA 1974 Time magazine headline warned of \u201cAnother Ice Age?\u201d and the U.K.\u2019s The Guardian science reporter headlined \u201cSpace Satellites Show New Ice Age Coming Fast.\u201d Brown University\u2019s Department of Geology warned of an imminent New Ice Age in a letter to President Nixon.\n\nIn 1988, environmental scientists predicted disappearance of the Maldive Islands: \u201cA gradual rise in average sea level is threatening to completely cover this Indian Ocean nation of 1196 small islands within the next 30 years.\u201d\n\nIn 1989, U.N. environmental experts told the Associated Press \u201cRising Seas Could Obliterate Nations\u201d by the year 2000. Part of New York City was supposed to be submerged by 2019.\n\nIn 2004, climate hoaxers predicted Britain would be like Siberia by 2020.\n\nAnd so it continues. See RealClimateScience for more fair and balanced climate reporting, and to discover there is no \u201cscientific consensus\u201d about an impending climate doomsday.\n\nEven if there is a slight uptick toward \u201cglobal warming\u201d of the Earth\u2019s climate, that would likely be good news.\n\nHistorically, warming periods in climate have been associated with greater food production, population increase, and the rise of civilizations, as during Europe\u2019s Renaissance and the flourishing of Native American cultures such as the Aztecs, Inca and Mississippians.\n\nIf you are determined to be a \u201cclimate nut\u201d then worry about a New Ice Age \u2014 the most credible climate boogeyman. After all, the old Ice Age was only 11,000 years ago \u2014 the blink of an eye in geological time \u2014 and lasted nearly 2 million years.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t think becoming a green socialist will save you from the next Ice Age. If catastrophic climate warming or cooling happens, there is nothing we can do about it.\n\nClimate change, when it happens, is driven by titanic natural forces far beyond mankind\u2019s puny control \u2014 like changing radiance of the sun or titanic volcanism over an area the size of Siberia lasting centuries that alters oceanic and atmospheric dynamics.\n\nDuring the last Ice Age, much of North America was buried under an ice sheet 3 miles high.\n\nBanning lawnmowers will not stop the next Ice Age, which is not expected for another 40,000-50,000 years anyway.\n\nYoung and old terrified of climate apocalypse would better spend their time and energy on projects really beneficial to humanity and the environment:\n\n\u2022 Elect Republicans to run Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore and other major cities that under decades of Democratic stewardship have been transformed from national treasures into environmental cesspools of poverty, drug addiction, violence and urban decay.\n\n\u2022 Support President Trump\u2019s EMP Executive Order to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures from solar or manmade electromagnetic pulses that can cause mass starvation, disease and societal collapse.\n\n\u2022 Support President Trump\u2019s modernization of U.S. nuclear forces.\n\nDeterring nuclear war should be environmental mission No. 1. To reduce fear of climate change, maybe we should reintroduce \u201cduck and cover\u201d exercises in kindergarten.\n\n\u2022 Peter Vincent Pry is executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security and served as chief of staff on the congressional EMP Commission.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
