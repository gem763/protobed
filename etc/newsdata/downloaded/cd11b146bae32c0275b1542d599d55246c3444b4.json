(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nActing director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire will not comply with a House Intelligence Committee subpoena ordering him to provide the panel with a whistleblower\u2019s report of \u201cserious misconduct,\u201d escalating a standoff with the panel\u2019s chairman over a complaint he says could involve the White House.\n\nPanel Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) issued a subpoena to Maguire last week, ordering him to provide the complaint to the committee or, failing that, to testify publicly Thursday about why it was being withheld. Maguire\u2019s general counsel, Jason Klitenic, informed Schiff in a Tuesday letter obtained by The Washington Post that the director was \u201cnot available on such short notice\u201d and that the hearing \u201cwould not be a productive exercise\u201d while the office is deliberating about how to handle the panel\u2019s demands.\n\nThe intelligence panel has detailed little about the complaint publicly, except to reveal that while the whistleblower works in the intelligence community, the case \u201cconcerns conduct by someone outside of the Intelligence Community,\u201d as Schiff stated in a letter to Maguire last week accompanying the subpoena. In that letter, Schiff also pointed out that Maguire\u2019s office refused to state whether White House officials and lawyers were involved in the decision not to transfer the complaint.\n\n[Trump\u2019s acting intelligence chief told to turn over whistleblower complaint or face public questioning by Congress]\n\nSchiff has charged that Maguire is violating the law by withholding the complaint from Congress. By statute, he has argued, the complaint should have been transmitted to the intelligence panel within seven days because the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general had determined that it was \u201cboth credible and urgent.\u201d\n\nBut Klitenic has pushed back against Schiff\u2019s reading of the whistleblower law as it applies to the current case. In a Sept. 13 response to the panel obtained by The Post, Klitenic argued that \u201cthere were serious concerns about whether the complaint met the statutory definition of an \u2018urgent concern.\u2019 \u201d Those concerns, he explained, led to consultation with the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cBased on those consultations, we determined that the allegations did not fall within the statutory definition of an \u2018urgent concern\u2019 and that the statute did not require the complaint to be transmitted to the intelligence committees,\u201d Klitenic wrote.\n\n\u201cThe information within the present complaint is different from that involved in any past cases of which we are aware,\u201d Klitenic continued, adding that \u201cbecause the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by people outside the intelligence community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees.\u201d\n\nSuch disclosures have piqued Schiff\u2019s suspicions, however, about why Maguire is loath to give the panel either the complaint or a fuller, public reckoning \u2014 and \u201cwhether the White House or Attorney General\u201d William P. Barr are ordering him not to comply with their demands, the congressman said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re determined to make sure that the whistleblower is able to provide his complaint to Congress, or her complaint to Congress, and that this urgent matter is addressed,\u201d Schiff said Tuesday. \u201c[Maguire] has yet to provide the complaint in response to the Committee\u2019s subpoena, so I expect him to appear on Thursday, under subpoena if necessary.\u201d", "description": "House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff said he expected acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire \u201cto come in voluntarily\u201d Thursday for testimony. But Maguire\u2019s general counsel told Schiff the director was \u201cnot available on such short notice.\u201d", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "September At Pm", "Karoun Demirjian Is A Congressional Reporter Covering National Security", "Including Defense", "Foreign Policy", "Intelligence", "Matters Concerning The Judiciary.
