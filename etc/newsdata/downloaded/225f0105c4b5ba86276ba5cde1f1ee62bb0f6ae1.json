Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., as a hearing on the Trump administration's housing plans turned to the subject of disaster relief funds for Puerto Rico.\n\nThe dispute centered on HUD missing a deadline to give Puerto Rico instructions on how to apply for $8.3 billion in aid to prevent damage from future natural disasters. A bill signed by President Trump in June gave HUD a 90-day deadline to provide those rules, Newsweek reported. Ten jurisdictions included in the bill got the directions they needed, with Puerto Rico being the only one left out.\n\nCarson was grilled by the congresswoman on the apparent decision to withhold funding over concerns about the government's management.\n\n\u201cLast week, your chief financial officer and your principal deputy assistant secretary for community planning and development admitted before Congress that HUD intentionally missed a legally required deadline that would have made congressionally appropriated funds available to Puerto Rico,\" Velazquez told Carson. \"Let me ask you, where specifically in federal law is HUD empowered to unilaterally withhold ... funds that have been appropriated by Congress?\u201d\n\nCALIFORNIA LAUNCHES AMERICA'S FIRST STATEWIDE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM\n\n\u201cCongress has specifically mandated that the Secretary of HUD make sure that funds that are allocated or provided for certain jurisdictions have the resources and the capacity to manage them,\" Carson responded.\n\nVelazquez then cut off Carson and told him he was not answering her question before asking it again. Carson attempted to speak but Velazquez interrupted him another time.\n\n\u201cReclaiming my time,\" she said, \"since you are not going to answer my question.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeemed like an answer to me,\u201d Carson shot back. \u201cAre you looking for an answer or a soundbite?\u201d\n\nVelazquez, after explaining that the HUD inspector general had not recommended that the funds be withheld, insinuated that the Trump administration withheld the money from Puerto Rico out of spite.\n\nBEN CARSON CLEARED AS HUD INSPECTOR GENERAL FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT IN FURNITURE CONTROVERSY\n\n\u201cI wonder if this was politically motivated,\u201d she said. \u201cDid anyone at the White House, including the president or the chief of staff, ask you to withhold money that was supposed to go to Puerto Rico?\u201d\n\nCarson responded: \u201cInterestingly, a lot of what we do is dictated by common sense. ... If you have a jurisdiction in which there are three changes of government within a month and which has historically had difficulty with financial management, to put an unprecedented amount of money in there without the appropriate controls is irresponsible.\u201d\n\nVelazquez then accused Carson and the Trump administration more generally of having contempt toward the U.S. territory that was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\nTrump has long clashed with Puerto Rican leaders and had called former governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 a \"terrible governor\" before he resigned in August. Trump said in July that Puerto Rico has \"grossly incompetent leadership.\"\n\nVelazquez said Tuesday that the disaster relief issue \u201cspeaks to this administration\u2019s disregard for Puerto Rico,\" asking HUD to send to Congress \"every communication related to Puerto Rico.\"\n\n\u201cAnd you know what sir, we\u2019re going to find out what motivated for you to withhold this money for the people of Puerto Rico. If this was about corruption, as you claimed in the press, so deal with your own corruption when you have FEMA officials who were arrested in Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCarson responded: \u201cWe have nothing to hide so I\u2019d be glad for you to get that information.\"\n\n\u201cOne way or another we\u2019re going to know the truth,\" Velazquez said before finishing her questioning.\n\nThe exchange prompted ranking member Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., to admonish Velazquez for her treatment of Carson -- before the congresswoman responded that alleged corruption in Puerto Rico is not a good enough reason for withholding funds when many other locations around the country received disaster relief funds without issue.\n\nThe exchange forced Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., to use her gavel to get Velazquez and McHenry to allow the hearing to continue.", "description": "Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson clashed Tuesday with Rep.\u00a0Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., as a hearing on\u00a0the Trump administration's housing plans turned to the subject of disaster relief funds for Puerto Rico.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096787905001_6096788015001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
