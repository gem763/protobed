Climate change kills. \u201c\n\n\u201cThree thousand Puerto Ricans did not open their eyes this morning because of a president that was too concerned about looking good rather than doing good,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cTwo hurricanes not one had hit Puerto Rico,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cTimes were hard. There was no food, no electricity. No water, no medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp was not getting there,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe were dying and President Trump was killing us with his bureaucracy and his inefficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know he said he couldn\u2019t get help to Puerto Rico because we are an island surrounded by water, lots and lots of water,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cOcean water. That is a quote by the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nCongress authorized about $43 billion in relief for the island but only one third of it has been delivered. Democrats blame the Trump administration, but federal officials blame corruption and financial irregularities in the Puerto Rican government.\n\nThe number of dead from the hurricane ranges from 64 to 2,975, depending on the source.\n\nCruz made the remarks at the Sanders\u2019 event where Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) formally endorsed the senator. Before her own election to Congress, Ocasio-Cortez worked for Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Puerto Rican Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz said on Saturday thousands of Puerto Ricans died because of Donald Trump's response to Hurricane Maria.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-868989880-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
