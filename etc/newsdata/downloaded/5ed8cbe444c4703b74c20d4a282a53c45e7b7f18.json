That explains all the nods from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fellow Tories while the queen was reading it. When all the pomp and circumstance was over, the heckling resumed. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn proceeded to tear apart the speech in the House of Commons.\n\n\"The prime minister promised us this queen\u2019s speech would dazzle us,\" Corbyn said. \"Upon closer inspection, Mr. Speaker, it is nothing more than fool\u2019s gold.\"\n\n\u201cThis legislative program is a propaganda exercise that cannot disguise that this government has failed on Brexit for over three years,\" he added.\n\nIn his response, Johnson asked why Corbyn had not yet agreed to a new general election. The latter replied simply that he \"doesn't trust\" the Conservatives and that he wants to wait until the uncertainty of a no deal Brexit has subsided.\n\n\"We may only be weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s Speech of a Labour government,\" Corbyn grinned.\n\nThe Labour leader also noted that they want a second Brexit referendum before a new election.\n\nJohnson has maintained that Britain is leaving the EU on Halloween, but if the UK doesn't agree to a deal with the bloc by the end of Tuesday, they may be looking at another delay.\n\nYou can read the Queen's speech in its entirety here.", "description": ".10/15/2019 11:00:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/b573e4ba-a6d0-47d5-b63c-ab49ca35ee73.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
