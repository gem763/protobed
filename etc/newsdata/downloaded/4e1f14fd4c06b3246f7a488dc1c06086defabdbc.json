Howell of Washington cited a 1974 federal appeals court decision in Haldeman v. Sirica that upheld that congressional impeachment proceedings are excepted from normal grand jury secrecy rules.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn carrying out the weighty constitutional duty of determining whether impeachment of the President is warranted, Congress need not redo the nearly two years of effort spent on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, nor risk being misled by witnesses, who may have provided information to the grand jury and the Special Counsel that varies from what they tell\u201d the House, Howell wrote.\n\nShe found that a House impeachment investigation and Senate trial qualify under a grand jury material exemption that permits prosecutors to share information \u201cpreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt a hearing this month, Howell called \u201cextreme\u201d the arguments presented by Trump administration lawyers who opposed the House request for Mueller grand jury materials.\n\nJustice Department attorneys had said that despite legal rulings during the impeachment inquiry into President Richard M. Nixon, in hindsight, courts in 1974 should not have given Congress materials from the Watergate grand jury.\n\nAD\n\nThey said the Haldeman decision relied on an \u201cambiguous\u201d interpretation of law that no longer is valid. The case was brought by Nixon\u2019s former chief of staff, who was challenging his prosecution spun off from the legal case against Nixon for the burglary \u2014 and subsequent coverup \u2014 of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex. Nixon resigned as the 37th president before he was formally impeached.\n\nAD\n\nHowell is a 2010 appointee of President Barack Obama.\n\nThe House lawsuit preceded the September disclosure of President Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian government officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry on the Ukrainian interactions focuses on an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nAD\n\nHouse General Counsel Douglas N. Letter argued in court that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in announcing the official impeachment inquiry, did not limit it to Ukraine but included an \u201cumbrella\u201d of pending investigations by six House committees.\n\nAD", "description": "Committee request predated impeachment inquiry but sought the Russia probe information in \u2018umbrella\u2019 investigation", "authors": ["Spencer S.
