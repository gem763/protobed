He would go on to become the first foreign-born man to achieve the status of a samurai warrior, and is the subject of two forthcoming Hollywood films.\n\nKnown as Yasuke, the man was a warrior who reached the rank of samurai under the rule of Oda Nobunaga - a powerful 16th Century Japanese feudal lord who was the first of the three unifiers of Japan.\n\nIn 1579, his arrival in Kyoto, the capital at the time, caused such a sensation that people climbed over one another to get a glimpse of him with some being crushed to death, according to historian Lawrence Winkler.\n\nWithin a year, Yasuke had joined the upper echelons of Japan's warrior class, the samurai. Before long, he was speaking Japanese fluently and riding alongside Nobunaga in battle.\n\n\"His height was 6 shaku 2 sun (roughly 6 feet, 2 inches (1.88m)... he was black, and his skin was like charcoal,\" a fellow samurai, Matsudaira Ietada, described him in his diary in 1579.\n\nThe average height of a Japanese man in 1900 was 157.9m (5 feet 2 inches) so Yasuke would have towered over most Japanese people in the 16th Century.\n\nMaking of a warrior\n\nThere are no records of Yasuke's date or country of birth. Most historians say he came from Mozambique but some have suggested other countries such as Ethiopia or Nigeria.\n\nWhat is known, however, is that Yasuke arrived in Japan with an Italian Jesuit named Alessandro Valignano on an inspection tour, and appears in recorded history only between 1579 and 1582.\n\nSome experts say he was a slave, but it is hard to say.\n\nFloyd Webb and Deborah DeSnoo, filmmakers working on a documentary film on Yasuke, believe assertions that he was a slave to be speculative at best.\n\n\"It would have been impossible for Yasuke to rise to the rank of a samurai in just a year without a warrior background,\" Ms DeSnoo says.\n\nSamurais often began their training in childhood.\n\nFriendship with the warlord\n\nYasuke met Nobunaga shortly after his arrival in Japan and he piqued his interest, the filmmakers say, by being a talented conversationalist.\n\nYasuke already spoke some Japanese and the two men got on well, according to academic Thomas Lockey, who has written a book on Yasuke.\n\nAccording to Mr Lockey, Yasuke entertained Nobunaga with tales from Africa and India, where Mr Lockey believes Yasuke had spent some time before going to Japan.\n\nMr Webb believes that because of his command of the Japanese language, Yasuke would have been viewed favourably.\n\n\"He was unlike the Jesuits, who had a religious agenda for the soul of Japan,\" Mr Webb says.\n\nThere are reports that Nobunaga instructed his nephew to give Yasuke a sum of money at the very first meeting.\n\nImage copyright Iwasaki Shoten Image caption Yasuke fighting alongside Oda Nobunaga in Kurusu Yoshio's children's book Kuro-suke\n\nFrench-Ivorian writer Serge Bile was so intrigued by Yasuke's extraordinary rise that he wrote a book about the warrior.\n\n\"It's part of the mystery surrounding this character. That's why he fascinates me,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe African warrior and the Japanese warlord had a lot in common.\n\nNobunaga was a great fan of the martial arts and spent a lot of time practising them. He was also an eccentric person, who according to Mr Webb, often dressed in Western-style clothes and sought the company of highly disciplined and intelligent people.\n\n\"[Yasuke] carried the warrior spirit,\" Mr Webb says. He understood the cultural language of Japan and loved to dance and perform Utenzi - a historic form of Swahili narrative poetry celebrating heroic deeds, Mr Webb adds. This suggests Yasuke could have come from Mozambique, as some historians believe, given that Swahili is still spoken in some northern parts of the country.\n\nSimilarly, Nobunaga was a lover of Noh Drama - a form of classical Japanese musical drama - and it is widely reported that he was a patron of the arts.\n\nNobunaga grew fond of Yasuke and treated him like family - the African was among a very select group of people allowed to dine with him.\n\n\"Nobunaga praised Yasuke's strength and stature, describing his might as that of 10 men,\" Ms DeSnoo says.\n\nThe legend lives on\n\nWhen Nobunaga bestowed the rank of samurai on Yasuke the idea of a non-Japanese samurai was something unheard of. Later, other foreigners would also obtain the title.\n\nAs the first foreign-born samurai, Yasuke fought important battles alongside Oda Nobunaga.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption French-Ivorian writer Serge Bil\u00e9 has long been fascinated with Yasuke\n\nHe was also there on the fateful night one of Nobunaga's generals, Akechi Mitsuhide, turned against him and set the warlord's palace alight, trapping Nobunaga in one of the rooms. Nobunaga ended his own life by performing seppuku, a ritual suicide.\n\nBefore he killed himself, he asked Yasuke to decapitate him and take his head and sword to his son, according to historian Thomas Lockley. It was a sign of great trust.\n\nThe legend of Yasuke comes to an end shortly after this, in 1582. The fall of Nobunaga at the hands of a treacherous general resulted in the exile of the first black samurai, possibly back to a Jesuit mission in Kyoto.\n\nThough his fate and the last years of his life remain unknown, Yasuke has lived on in the imaginations of many Japanese who grew up with the award-winning children's book Kuro-suke (kuro meaning \"black\" in Japanese) by Kurusu Yoshio.\n\nThe book, which dramatises Yasuke's life, ends with a bittersweet note: after Nobunaga kills himself, Kuro-suke (Yasuke) is taken to a temple where he dreams of his parents in Africa and weeps.\n\nEntertainment industry newspaper Variety reported in May that Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman is set to play Yasuke in a forthcoming feature film.\n\nIt will be the second Hollywood film being developed on the life of Yasuke.\n\nIn 2017, Hollywood studio Lionsgate announced it was developing a film on the life of the black samurai.\n\nNearly 500 years later, his unusual life continues to awe and inspire people.", "description": "Yasuke was entrusted with decapitating his Japanese lord - a huge honour 500 years ago.", "authors": ["Naima Mohamud", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B3B8/production/_109180064_b43690ea-223b-4407-92fb-c3d72830c195.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
