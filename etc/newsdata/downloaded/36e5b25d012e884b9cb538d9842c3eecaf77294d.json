The city\u2019s current library system blocks card holders when they owe a fine of $10 or more.\n\nThe new system begins Tuesday.\n\nLightfoot framed the policy change as her latest attempt to help people who have the hardest time paying off their fines.\n\nWe\u2019re not as concerned about the economics, Lightfoot said of the new policy. \u201cThis is about educating folks, giving them access to learning, having a safe space where people can come and learn.\n\nLibrary officials said one in every three library card holders in the library\u2019s South District is banned from withdrawing items. Only one of every six library card users in the North District is also locked out.\n\nOne in five of those blocked cards belongs to a child under the age of 14.\n\nWith this new system, books that are checked out will automatically renew up to 15 times, unless a hold is placed on them, according to a Chicago Public Library news release. Misplaced items will be tagged as \u201clost\u201d in the system and accounts will be charged for replacement costs, if items are not turned in a week after due date. The charge will be cleared when the items are returned.\n\nThe elimination of library fines follows similar changes to fines and fees related to tickets and city vehicle stickers.\n\n\u201cThe bold reforms we\u2019re taking to make the Chicago Public Library system fine-free and forgive city sticker debt will end the regressive practices disproportionately impacting those who can least afford it, ensure every Chicagoan can utilize our city\u2019s services and resources, and eliminate the cycles of debt and generational poverty because of a few mistakes,\u201d Lightfoot said in a news release.\n\nDetroit and Phoenix announced similar plans this month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chicago is about to become the largest city in the country to eliminate overdue fees for library books and other items in an effort to remove barriers that deter youth and low-income patrons.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/chicago_schools_qa_10887_c0-152-2312-1500_s1770x1032.jpg?409b0d629acf3f21694f0aa2545ff0e94394e86d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
