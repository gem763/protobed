I think he's carried himself very well,\" said the left-back, via Goal.com .\n\n\"I'll be looking forward to facing him on Sunday. Obviously, I hope to come out on top.\"\n\nLiverpool go to Old Trafford on a remarkable run of eight successive Premier League victories this season, and 17 across both the start of this campaign and the end of 2018/19.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nBut Jurgen Klopp is yet to taste victory at the home of the Reds' great rivals, and Robertson wants to put that right.\n\n\"I think what makes the fixture so special is that it's historic,\" continued the Scot.\n\n\"There have been such great battles down the years.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"And they've always had top teams who have always fought against each other for everything on the pitch.\n\n\"It's always like that. And it's genuinely a different atmosphere when you play against them. It's one game that we always look forward to.\n\n\"Since I've been a Liverpool player, we've not managed to get a result at Old Trafford. So hopefully that changes on Sunday.\"", "description": "The Scotland teammates will lock horns at Old Trafford on Sunday", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638772.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
