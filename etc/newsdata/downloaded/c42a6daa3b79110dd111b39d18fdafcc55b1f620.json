Xavier Elizondo said: 'Everybody's going to eat here. If we can hit this by Wednesday, you know what I mean? Christmas is a week after that.'\n\nJurors also heard he later told the informant, Jeffrey Owens, he had been forced to 'do this on the straight' after spotting cameras in the property, adding: 'It would have been a good Christmas for everybody.'\n\nElizondo is said to have been concerned the money and cameras planted by the FBI were actually drug dealers recording devices, the court heard.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty, along with his colleague Officer David Salgado, to conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges alleging they paid informants to lie to judges for search warrants.\n\nChicago police Sgt. Xavier Elizondo arrives for his trial in Chicago on Tuesday. He has pleaded not guilty, along with his colleague Officer David Salgado, to conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges alleging they paid informants to lie to judges for search warrants\n\nChicago Police Officer David Salgado uses his attorney Michael Petro's suit jacket to shield himself from the camera while exiting the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse\n\nIn one recording played to Chicago court on Thursday Elizondo said: 'Like, you know, we're businessmen, let's do some business.\n\n'Everybody's going to eat here. If we can hit this by Wednesday, you know what I mean? Christmas is a week after that.'\n\nA month later Elizondo and Salgado are said to have stolen $4,200 in another FBI sting.\n\nJurors in the officers' corruption trial also heard from judge Mauricio Araujo on Wednesday. The 54-year-old judge said to have reviewed and approved many of the officer's drug-related search warrants.\n\nOne warrant he approved was that of an FBI sting, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nAraujo, who has not been charged with criminal wrongdoing, told the court he would have not approved the warrant if he thought the information was not accurate.\n\nHe said: 'I'm authorizing officers to go into someone's home, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment without a (valid) warrant.'\n\nSalgado, using a jacket to shield himself, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges alleging he paid informants to lie to judges for search warrants\n\nAraujo, who said he signed off on around three search warrants a day, told the FBI 'the warrants speak for themselves' when confronted in 2018, The Chicago Tribune reports.\n\nOf Salgado Araujo testified: 'He would ask me if I was available, and I would say yes.'\n\nHe is said to have been 'friendly' with Salgado, attending a wake for his mother and going to his bachelor party in Colombia.\n\nElizondo is also accused of attempting to destroy evidence, while Salgado also faces lying to the FBI allegations.\n\nBoth men have been on paid desk duty since January 2018.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Sean Franzblau called them 'corrupt police officers who betrayed their badges' and tried to hide their crimes when the FBI caught up to them.\n\nFranzblau contended that after becoming suspicious they were being watched, Elizondo was heard on a wiretapped telephone call telling Salgado to get rid of stolen drug money the FBI had planted.\n\nOpening statements in the criminal trial of Sgt. Xavier Elizondo, 47, and Officer David Salgado. 39, began Tuesday at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse (pictured) in Chicago\n\n'Just make sure whatever you have in your house isn't there no more, you know what I mean?' Elizondo was purported to have said in a January 2018 call, according to Franzblau.\n\nAn FBI raid on Salgado's home the next day determined both Elizondo and Salgado erased call records from their phones.\n\nElizondo's attorney, Michael Clancy, said there is no evidence his client stole anything through searches conducted by his team.\n\nClancy asserted Elizondo is an effective crime fighter who gamed informants as good police officers do.\n\n'Law enforcement is allowed to play these games to fight crime,' Clancy said. 'They're policing out there. This isn't some money grab.'\n\nSalgado's attorney, Michael Petro, questioned the credibility of prosecution witnesses, noting informants have admitted to lying under oath and were either paid for cooperating with federal prosecutors or given immunity.\n\n'Money and freedom provide people with a motive to lie,' Petro said. 'They slant their testimony.'\n\nThe investigation into Elizondo, 47, and Salgado, 39, began in November 2017 after a source for the FBI told agents that an informant for Elizondo's team told him about receiving money and drugs from the officers in exchange for information.\n\nThe informant allegedly began working for Elizondo's team after he was targeted in a raid that did not result in criminal charges.\n\nIf convicted, Elizondo and Salgado face a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for the embezzlement charge and five years for the conspiracy charge.\n\nMaking a false statement to the FBI carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.", "description": "In recordings played to the court, inset, Sgt.
