We first came here at the end of 2011 \u2013 and got engaged.\n\n\n\nWe loved it, and after we were married, there was only one choice for the honeymoon. We returned at the end of 2012 as Mr and Mrs Humes. Then, at the end of last year, we were back again, and this time as a trio, with our seven-month-old daughter Alaia-Mai. So what is it we like so much about the Maldives that has attracted us three times in three years?\n\n\n\nTotally tranquil: Rochelle and Marvin relax on Kanifushi\n\nA big thing for us, both being in the public eye, is that you can be sure of privacy. It's also somewhere you feel very safe. Another draw is that everybody who works there treats you so warmly. Returning this time with Alaia-Mai, we really noticed how great people in the Maldives are with children. They all really wanted to make our visit a great experience.\n\n\n\nHaving been there twice before, we didn't have any anxieties about taking Alaia-Mai, even though she was very young \u2013 and she enjoyed every minute of our time there because she got so much fuss! We flew out on the day after Boxing Day as I can't bear that lull between Christmas and New Year. The break was tricky to organise because Marvin had just finished an especially busy time with the JLS farewell tour, and was lined up to take over as co-presenter of the new series of BBC1's The Voice as soon as we got back.\n\n\n\nParadise found: The main pool on the ocean at Atmosphere resort\n\nThankfully, getting to the Maldives is surprisingly easy. We flew direct with British Airways to the islands' capital, Male, and then boarded a seaplane to take us to the new Atmosphere resort at Kanifushi. I'm actually really scared of flying \u2013 I can get petrified, and was dreading the seaplane experience. But, funnily enough, I liked mal' plane. One definite plus was that the landing on the sea was a much more gentle experience than touching down on a runway in a big jet. We didn't really know what to expect from Atmosphere as it's a brand new resort \u2013 but being in the Maldives, I knew that we were in for a treat.\n\n\n\nAnd Kanifushi didn't disappoint. What we most wanted to do once we'd arrived was to put up our feet up and switch off. The Maldives are definitely the place for this: there's pure tranquillity everywhere. Every view looks like something from a picture postcard or an illustration from a travel magazine, and I've never seen water so blue. While we were looking to enjoy some relaxing time, it's certainly not just a 'fly-and-flop' place.\n\n\n\nQuenching an island thirst: Rochelle tweets a photo home\n\nYou can have a very active holiday if you want to. A host of water sports are available \u2013 Marvin loves scuba-diving here \u2013 and you can take excursions to see dolphins out at sea or head out to look at some more of the islands that make up the Maldives. There was one activity we were most looking forward to: the resort's New Year's Eve party. We knew from previous experience that they know how to throw a good party in the Maldives. Sure enough, the celebration at Kanifushi was fantastic.\n\n\n\nWe had a fine dinner on the beach followed by fireworks, then live music and a great DJ set. Did we get up and sing? No \u2013 but maybe if we'd had a few more mojitos...\n\nFor children older than Alaia-Mai, the resort has a great kids' club where they put on all sorts of fantastic things, such as fashion shows and treasure hunts, tennis, volleyball and football. And, of course, there's PlayStation on tap. Meals at the resort are incredible.\n\n\n\nEverything is always very fresh and healthy. Marvin and I love fresh fish and great fruit and there was always a lot of both available here. And there's an amazing variety of eating places to choose from. Just Veg is the first vegetarian restaurant in the Maldives and serves cuisine from the Mediterranean, Arabic and Indian regions. Teppanyaki Grill claims to offer 'an authentic Teppanyaki experience', so diners share a table surrounding a large hotplate. The Spice is the main restaurant offering a varied menu of different cuisines, and all fabulous.\n\n\n\nBeach baby: Daughter Alaia-Mai has fun on the beach\n\nOur favourite food is Japanese, so we ate a lot of sushi. The main restaurant had a big barbecue every night with fresh fish and meats, which was also great. In the Maldives, informality is the watchword, and that was just what we needed as in our working lives we have to be so busy. When I'm going to be on stage, for example,\n\n\n\nI spend so much time having to get all dressed up. So the laid-back style of the Maldives came as a welcome break. We've been back in Britain for only a few months and already we're dreaming of our next trip \u2013 counting the days until we can get back to the Maldives for another blissful family holiday. We can't wait.\n\n", "description": "The Saturdays singer Rochelle Hume and her pop star husband reveal why they are so besotted by the Indian Ocean\u2019s stunning islands.", "authors": ["Rochelle Humes"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/01/article-2550086-1B06BA1A00000578-857_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-02-01"}
