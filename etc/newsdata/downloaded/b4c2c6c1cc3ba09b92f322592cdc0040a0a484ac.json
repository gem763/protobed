If passed, the text would become official party policy.\n\nThe change would extend the right to vote in general elections to anyone with residency rights in the UK, regardless of their nationality. Currently only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are allowed to vote in general elections. Other foreign nationals living in Britain can vote only in local elections and European elections.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In the 2016 referendum, only people with the right to vote in UK general elections were allowed to vote.\n\nIt would also be likely to deliver millions more votes for pro-EU and pro-immigration parties in future general elections.\n\nThe move has been co-ordinated by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and is expected to be approved by conference delegates when it is put to a vote on Monday.\n\nA statement accompanying the motion, signed by Labour MPs, trade unionists and representatives of EU citizens in the UK, said it was \"fundamentally wrong\" that millions of people living in the UK are currently denied the right to vote.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We must not allow working class people to be divided on the basis of where they are from.\n\n\"But speaking out on behalf of migrants is not enough. As representatives and activists of the labour movement, we understand that people only ever win justice and beat prejudice when they have a voice of their own. At minimum, this means having the right to vote.\"\n\nIt added: \u201cMillions of people who have made their home here cannot vote here. It is fundamentally wrong that so many millions of people are denied a vote in decisions which affect them deeply.\n\n\u201cSo at this Labour Party conference and beyond, we will support moves to extend equal rights to vote to all UK residents. And we will support moves to put this extension of the franchise into Labour\u2019s next general election manifesto.\"", "description": "Labour is set to commit to giving\u00a0full voting rights to foreign nationals living in the UK in a move that could have a seismic impact on a future Brexit referendum.", "authors": ["Benjamin Kentish"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/11/jeremy-corbyn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
