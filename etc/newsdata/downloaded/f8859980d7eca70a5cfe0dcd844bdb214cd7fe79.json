Since the administration took on this fight, China has countered each tariff announcement with one of their own. It\u2019s a move from their vantage point that gets a free pass in the U.S. press, which continues to portray this battle as something Trump started.\n\nOn the contrary, it\u2019s something he aims to win. However, my greatest fear from day one is what would constitute a victory, and whether he would allow President Xi a way to save face or not. I appreciate the firmness of President Trump's resolve, but with so many forces rooting against him, any signs of panic or anger will become media fodder.\n\nUsually, the media vs Trump is just another day, but when it involves big market selloffs and excuses to toss around the \"R\" word, it becomes dangerous. I don't care about big businesses whining after shipping off millions of American jobs, but there are powerful forces that understand that a sustained market selloff can make a lot of bad stuff a reality.\n\nFor now, President Trump has raised the stakes again.\n\nTariffs on existing $250 billion in Chinese exports will climb to 30% from 25% on October 1, 2019\n\nTariffs on proposed $300 billion in Chinese exports will start September 1, 2019, at 15% instead of 10%\n\nOn Friday, only nine stocks were higher in the S&P 500. In other words, there was no place to hide. Remember the fundamentals of 99 stocks? It did not change on Friday or even in the past four weeks. This is where individual investors want to make sure they do not react in anger or panic, even as the market tumbles on more uncertainty.\n\nPresident Trump cannot blink. However, he can walk back some of the actions and articulate with the American public about the game plan from here.\n\nAmericans, especially those that don\u2019t worship at the altar \u2013 and the country should only be about big businesses making unlimited profits - are behind in this fight.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s former vice minister at the Ministry of Commerce spoke overnight, saying China awaits a fair and equal trade deal. If that\u2019s true, they will begin to negotiate in good faith and avoid the wrath of Trump.\n\nI\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t learned that yet. They need to come up with something quickly to show they are serious.\n\nApproach\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 3 1 Technology Utilities Cash 2 0 3\n\nHey, Business Roundtable (BRT), I heard you\u2019ve changed. If that\u2019s true, I would like to see it. Here\u2019s my letter.\n\nDear Business Roundtable,\n\nYour recent shift in the \u201cpurpose of a corporation\u201d sent shockwaves through the business world that was also met with skepticism and outright disbelief.\n\nBy shifting from the bedrock position established since 1977, the sole purpose of a business is to make profits, there is a tacit admission that you have let down society in many ways. You now say the commitment is to a free market economy that serves all Americans in the goal of more inclusive prosperity.\n\nThese are the new goals beyond fatter bottom lines.\n\nDelivering value to our customer\n\nInvesting in our employees - we foster diversity, inclusion, dignity, and respect\n\nDealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers\n\nSupporting the communities in which we work -we respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses\n\nIf you are serious about these commitments, then why isn\u2019t there a greater effort to push for real fair and free trade with China? China\u2019s actions counter everything that the new \u201cwoke\u201d Business Roundtable says it stands for:\n\nWorld\u2019s greatest polluter (not even close)\n\nWar on religious freedom, including putting one million Muslims in reeducation \u201ccamps\u201d\n\nNo freedom of the press\n\nNo due process\n\nRampant theft of American intellectual property\n\nDebt diplomacy and militaristic ambitions\n\nI appreciate the goal of moving forward without the constant relitigating of the past holding back further evolution. However, this means action and putting your money where your mouth is.\n\nMillions of American manufacturing jobs were shipped overseas.\n\nMillions of American manufacturing and farming jobs have gone to immigrants seduced into illegally entering America by providing them an income significantly higher than what they can earn in their home nations while paying too little for Americans to move away from financial assistance programs.\n\nIf your answer to these issues is to argue for the status quo and suggest any changes would mean higher prices for consumers, you are being disingenuous, and your statement is a farce. The moment is now, and businesses are going to have to do more than get rid of plastic straws.\n\nOtherwise, it is only about fatter profits, not American dignity or respect.\n\nCharles V.
