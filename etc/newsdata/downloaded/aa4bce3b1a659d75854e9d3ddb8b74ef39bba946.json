But the 52-year-old entered the year on shaky footing and the season got out of hand quickly.\n\nOffensive line coach Bill Callahan, 63, was expected to be named interim head coach later Monday.\n\nThe Redskins are 0-5 and have lost 11 of their last 12 dating back to last season, when quarterback Alex Smith suffered a season-ending broken leg.\n\nGruden\u2019s removal had been rumored for weeks as losses piled up and Washington got off to its worst start since 2001.\n\nAsked about his status following Sunday\u2019s loss, Gruden said he had not been told anything and would show up to work as long as his key worked.\n\nGruden finished with a record of 35-49-1. The Redskins made the playoffs just once in that span, last making it during the 2015 season.\n\nGruden finished with a record of 35-49-1 from 2014 through Sunday. The Redskins made the playoffs just once in that span, last making it during the 2015 season.\n\nInternally, the Redskins had hoped a retooled offense and a young, talented defense would carry them in 2019, but that quickly proved not to be the case.\n\nGruden knew 2019 would be a make-or-break year. In May, he joked with reporters that if he didn\u2019t make the playoffs this season, he\u2019d be out of a job.\n\nWith his future uncertain, Gruden seemed determined to go about his final months doing things his way.\n\nWhen the Redskins took Dwayne Haskins with the 15th overall pick in April, Gruden said the rookie needed development before being ready to play in the NFL.\n\nThere were pre-draft reports that Gruden preferred Duke\u2019s Daniel Jones, a more experienced starter, or wanted the Redskins to use the 15th pick on a different position entirely.\n\nAs the season began, Gruden immediately incited controversy. For the season-opener, he benched running back Adrian Peterson, making the 34-year-old inactive after second-year back Derrius Guice had won the starting the job. The move was unpopular in the team\u2019s locker room, especially among the team\u2019s veterans.\n\nThree weeks later, Gruden came under fire for his handling of Haskins.\n\nDown 14 points to the New York Giants, Gruden turned to the rookie in a moment of desperation and hope that Haskins could provide a spark. But Haskins struggled, throwing three interceptions in the 24-3 loss.\n\nAfter the game, Gruden re-opened the team\u2019s quarterback competition \u2014 and refused to call Haskins the future of the franchise. \u201cHe\u2019s got to earn that right first,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside the organization, with the Redskins 0-4, experts and fans tore into Gruden. ESPN analyst Louis Riddick blasted the coach for playing Haskins against the Giants, suggesting the Ohio State product was being set up for failure. ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith said Gruden had \u201ccompletely quit\u201d on the Redskins.\n\nBut Gruden stuck to his convictions \u2014 taking jabs at his critics along the way.\n\n\u201cNo matter what we do with (Haskins), we\u2019re going to be wrong, so it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cMy view is that I\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s best for him and what\u2019s best for this football team and what I think is best.\u201d\n\nFinally, Gruden announced Friday the Redskins would start Colt McCoy \u2014 not Haskins \u2014 against the Patriots.\n\nThat decision, too, was seen as an act of lashing out. By not turning to the rookie, Gruden went with the quarterback he had favored over his six seasons as coach. Like Gruden, McCoy arrived to Washington in 2014 and knew the offense inside and out. If Gruden was going to go down, he\u2019d do it with his preferred quarterback.\n\nMcCoy wasn\u2019t enough to save his job and the Redskins again looked disorganized in Sunday\u2019s loss.\n\nMonday\u2019s firing didn\u2019t come as a surprise, but it was startling to Gruden struggle this season with the dysfunction surrounding the organization.\n\nThroughout his first five years, the 52-year-old routinely navigated obstacles \u2014 from quarterback controversies to off the field incidents to a plethora of injuries.\n\nOver the course of 2017 and 2018, the Redskins had a combined 49 players on injured reserve, a league-high. Gruden kept his composure through it all and his players responded by playing with effort, even if they were overmatched.\n\nGruden\u2019s easy-going demeanor, though, drew criticism, including from a few players.\n\nFormer safety D.J. Swearinger ripped the Redskins for, in his view, not practicing hard enough during the week. But other players generally appreciated Gruden\u2019s approach, calling him a player\u2019s coach who could also get serious when needed.\n\nIn 2014, Washington hired Gruden following a fractious season with former coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback Robert Griffin III. Gruden was chosen in hopes he would revive Griffin\u2019s career, given his success with Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton the year prior.\n\nGruden, though, did not mesh with Griffin. The Redskins finished 4-12 in 2014 and the following season, Gruden turned to Kirk Cousins as the team\u2019s full-time starter. With Cousins at the helm, Washington made the playoffs in 2015 \u2014 going 9-7 en route to winning the NFC East.\n\nBut the success was short-lived. The Redskins slipped back to the pack, and off-the-field drama involving Cousins\u2019 contract led to the quarterback\u2019s departure in the 2018 offseason.\n\nThe Redskins replaced Cousins with Smith, a reliable veteran who helped Washington get off to a 6-3 start before breaking his leg against the Houston Texans.\n\nSince Smith\u2019s injury, the Redskins have played five quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cYou would love to have some continuity (quarterback), some consistency there,\u201d Gruden said last week. \u201cUnfortunately, we have not had that luxury here in a while.\u201d\n\nIf the Redskins do find that luxury, if Haskins does establish himself as the franchise\u2019s savior, Gruden won\u2019t be around to see it.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
