Rookie defensive end Nick Bosa collected three sacks and had an interception in the win. Arik Armstead had two sacks for the 49ers.\n\n\u201cWhenever your moves are working really good, it\u2019s just a good feeling,\u201d Bosa told reporters. \u201cOnce you get a sack, really it just lets you calm down. I mean, two of those sacks could have been [DeForest] Buckner\u2019s easily. We\u2019ve kind of gone back and forth giving each other sacks this year, so I\u2019m lucky to have two interior guys who close the pocket so well.\u201d\n\nTevin Coleman had 118 yards from scrimmage and four touchdowns in the win. Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen threw three interceptions.\n\nWHATTA MAN! @nbsmallerbear with the INT #GoNiners pic.twitter.com/ZvQBocybYD\u2014 San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201c[Tevin] can fly, man,\u201d 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo said. \u201cWe had a trap play and he was one-on-one with the safety and he just burned him with pure speed. He did everything today. Tevin was awesome.\u201d\n\nGaroppolo found Emmanuel Sanders for a 4-yard touchdown pass on the game\u2019s opening drive. The Panthers got on the scoreboard with a 41-yard field goal from Joey Slye later in the first quarter. Coleman increased the 49ers\u2019 lead to 14-3 with a 19-yard rushing score at the end of the opening frame.\n\nGaroppolo hit Coleman with a 10-yard touchdown pass for a 21-3 advantage with 12:48 remaining in the first half. Coleman scored his third touchdown of the game on a 48-yard run two minutes before halftime, giving San Francisco a 27-3 edge.\n\nThe Panthers got to Garoppolo for a safety and got a Christian McCaffrey rushing score in the third quarter before the 49ers returned to the end zone. Deebo Samuel gave the 49ers a 34-13 edge with a 20-yard rushing score midway through the third quarter.\n\nColeman scored his final touchdown on a 1-yard run with 32 seconds remaining in the third frame. The 49ers got a 20-yard field goal from Robbie Gould before Raheem Mostert scored the game\u2019s final touchdown with a 41-yard run in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIn the NFL, you never expect to just blow someone out like that, especially a good team like that,\u201d 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cThey\u2019re a real good team. They\u2019re a team who will be around at the end of the year. They can run the ball. They play really good on defense.\n\n\u201cOur team was just ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers face the Arizona Cardinals at 8:20 p.m. EDT Thursday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.
