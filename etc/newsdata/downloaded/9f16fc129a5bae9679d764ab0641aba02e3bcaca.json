Suzuki led for virtually the entire race, held in torrid conditions, as he won in a time of four hours 04:20 minutes.\n\nChina\u2019s Liang Rui won the women\u2019s race in four hours 23.26 minutes ahead of compatriot Li Maocuo with Eleonora Anna Giorgi of Italy in third.\n\nThe races began at 11.30 p.m. to avoid the worst of the Doha heat but conditions were still stifling with high humidity.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was hell ... very, very hot ... it was very bad,\u201d Vieira told Reuters. \u201cHow did I cope? Just a lot of ice and cold water.\u201d\n\nVieira, who said that he intended to compete in his final world championship in two years\u2019 time, added that the late hour was also a challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning - that\u2019s the time to leave a nightclub. I usually go to sleep at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening,\u201d said Vieira, who added to the bronze medal he won in Moscow in 2013 in the 20 kilometres.\n\n\u201cI feel great ... it\u2019s not every day that you win a medal, especially at the age of 43. (The secret) is to train every day with pleasure, and do what I enjoy doing - which is athletics. Just that.\u201d\n\nApart from the late hour and the brutal weather, the race was held in a somewhat surreal atmosphere with almost no spectators apart from the athletes\u2019 team mates, officials and reporters.\n\nThe races consisted of 25 loops of Doha\u2019s waterfront highway although the athletes only got small glimpses of the sea because of advertising hoardings and floodlight towers along the length of the course.\n\nThe IAAF, the governing body of athletics, said it took extra precautions such as increasing refreshment points and a stronger presence of medical staff.\n\nDefending champion and world record holder Yohann Diniz was an early casualty, the Frenchman saying he \u201cstarted to suffocate quickly\u201d after dropping out.\n\nSuzuki quickly broke away and led for nearly the entire four hours. At one point, he was more than three minutes clear but began to look shaky with seven kilometres to go and slowed to near walking pace at the refreshment stations.\n\nChina\u2019s Niu Wenbin cut his lead to around 90 seconds on the last lap but was himself overhauled by Vieira and Dunfee.\n\nDunfee described the conditions as \u201ccarnage\u201d but not dangerous. \u201cFrom a safety point of view, it was fine, the eight stations were plenty, medical was amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nLiang comfortably won the women\u2019s race as she finished more than three minutes ahead of her nearest rival.\n\n\u201cBefore the start, I knew it was going to be hot. My coach told me to start slowly and use the ice,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it helped a lot.\u201d", "description": "Japan's Yusuke Suzuki won the world championship 50 kilometres race walk on Sunday while 43-year-old Joao Vieira defied conditions he described as \"hell\" to become the oldest man to win a medal in any event.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435065033&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S024-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
