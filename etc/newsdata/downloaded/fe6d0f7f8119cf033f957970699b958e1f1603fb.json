However, it warned that strong sun and high temperatures were expected to return to the region over coming days, raising the risk of fires ahead.\n\nNo plans to withdraw troops\n\nArmed forces commander Williams Kaliman said there was no immediate plan to withdraw about 5,000 troops that had been sent to battle the worst fires Bolivia has had over the last two decades.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nCritics say deforestation, caused by the government's policy of increasing farming, is to blame for the disaster.\n\nThe government says it has spent more than $20m in its effort to douse the flames. Complaints about the government's handling of the crisis have dented the popularity of Bolivia's leftist president, Evo Morales.\n\nIn neighbouring Brazil, the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest receded in September amid improved weather conditions and containment efforts by the country's military.", "description": "Storms help the military contain blazes in the Bolivian Amazon region of Chiquitania.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/040f07604f2e4deeb3e2ba8ad3f3da01_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
