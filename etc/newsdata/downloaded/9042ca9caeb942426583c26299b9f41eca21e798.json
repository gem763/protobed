Thank you.\n\nBut in terms of events that are not funny at all, we move along to the United Nations where, on Thursday, a resolution was proposed in the Security Council condemning Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. Its principal sponsor was the European Union. Then, this happened. From the EUObserver:\n\nEU envoys to the UN Security Council (UNSC), from Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Poland, and the UK spoke to press in New York after the US and Russia blocked an EU-drafted UN resolution on the conflict. The German ambassador, Jurgen Schulz, read out the EU statement anyway. \"We call upon Turkey to cease the unilateral military action,\" Schulz said, as the Turkish military bombarded Kurdish positions in northern Syria and Kurdish artillery fired on Turkish towns on the other side of the border. The Turkish offensive would create \"fertile ground for the resurgence of Da'esh\" in a \"significant threat to regional, international, and European security\", Schulz added, referring to an Islamist militant group that is sometimes known as Isis. It would also \"exacerbate civilian suffering and provoke further displacements which will further increase the number of refugees,\" he said.\n\nThis country joined with Vladimir Putin's thuggish, failing petro-kleptocracy to veto a UN resolution that would have condemned the slaughter of the people who helped the West defeat ISIS in Syria. That we engage in any joint international activity with that murderous regime is disgraceful enough, but it's made worse by the fact that our own president* is so deep in Putin's pocket that he's probably got a polonium-laced breath mint stuck to his head.\n\n\n\nAnd what of the president*? Well, he jetted off to Minneapolis to hold another one of his noisy wankfests in which he a) mocked Hunter Biden for doing about one-tenth of what his useless spalpeens do before breakfast every morning; b) did a truly terrible imitation of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page achieving orgasm, and I can't tell you how little I wanted to type that; Serge Gainsbourg, the president* ain't, and c) remarked that Joe Biden was only vice president because he knew how to \"kiss Barack Obama's ass.\" The president* of the United States said that. And his crowd went apeshit bananas in reply.\n\nMy goodness -- Trump is now diving into conspiracy theories about Ilhan Omar's marital status he read on a right-wing blog. Completely unhinged. pic.twitter.com/kjy3qCwK5i \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 11, 2019\n\nHe also whipped up the goobers with a slanderous attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar. This is going to be the worst, most racist presidential campaign since 1868, and I don't think the elite political press is ready for it. For example, here's the NYT's lede on the president*'s latest episode of public insanity.\n\nA fired-up President Trump lashed out against Democrats at a combative campaign rally on Thursday night, deriding them as \u201cvery sick and deranged people\u201d who were only investigating him for abuse of power in order to \u201cerase your vote.\u201d\n\n\"Fired-up.\" \"Combative.\"\n\nThe Hill called the rally \"feisty.\"\n\nIt's right in front of their eyes, all of it. The company's name is Fraud Guarantee, for the love of Christ.\n\nRespond to this post on the Esquire Politics Facebook page here.\n\nFrom Esquire\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "At last night's wankfest in Minneapolos, the president* whipped up the goobers with a slanderous attack on Rep.
