He was 95.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s current leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, announced the death on Twitter, but did not disclose the cause. Mr. Mugabe, who had displayed physical decline over recent years, had been receiving hospital treatment in Singapore since April, Mnangagwa said last month.\n\nMr. Mugabe was forced to resign as Zimbabwe\u2019s leader days after the army staged a coup in November 2017. At the time, he was world\u2019s oldest head of state and one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving leaders.\n\nMnangagwa, who formerly served as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s vice president, is a wily and resilient veteran of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence war who once led the feared internal security service. Nicknamed \u201cThe Crocodile\u201d for his quick-to-strike survival skills, Mnangagwa replaced the ailing Mr. Mugabe in the 2017 coup, then was narrowly elected president last year.\n\nIt is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe's founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe (1/2) \u2014 President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) September 6, 2019\n\nMr. Mugabe\u2019s fall marked the end of one of the last surviving \u201cBig Men\u201d of the continent, the onetime revolutionary leaders who inherited the security apparatus of their former colonial rulers and used an iron fist to enrich themselves and repress their citizens.\n\nMr. Mugabe emerged from the bush in 1980 and took power in what was once white-minority-ruled Southern Rhodesia after a protracted civil war. He pledged pragmatism and reconciliation. But after a promising start, the country once known as the breadbasket of southern Africa descended into a nightmare of widespread unemployment, hyperinflation, hunger and disease.\n\n\n\nFormer South African president Nelson Mandela, left, walks with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare on Dec. 13, 1998.

(Rob Cooper/AP)\n\nMr. Mugabe and his cronies unleashed gangs of armed thugs to beat up, torture and kill their political foes, while suffocating Zimbabwe\u2019s fledgling democratic institutions. The regime used food aid as a way to reward supporters and starve opponents. Epidemics of AIDS and cholera ravaged rural areas, and the country\u2019s once-thriving commercial farms were gutted.\n\nCities swelled with hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the countryside. In 2005, Mr. Mugabe pitilessly carried out Operation Drive Out Trash, an urban beautification effort that made hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers homeless.\n\nCars waited in line for days outside filling stations, rationing left most people with electricity only every other day, and residents went shopping with suitcases filled with almost worthless currency, its value falling by the hour.\n\n[Mugabe resigns under military pressure after 37 years as Zimbabwe\u2019s leader]\n\nMr. Mugabe blamed those ills and more on a long list of enemies, foreign and domestic, while portraying himself as a beleaguered African hero. He conjured a paranoid vision of a major conspiracy, led by white farmers and businessmen and their black political puppets and funded by evil governments in London and Washington.\n\nBut Mr. Mugabe\u2019s downfall came not at the hands of foreign enemies but from his once-loyal generals. They rebelled against his attempt to install his mercurial wife, Grace Mugabe, as his successor, and placed him under house arrest. Thousands marched in the streets to support Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ouster, while his former allies in the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) expelled him from his role as party chairman, an ignominious collapse for the only elected leader Zimbabwe had ever known.\n\nAs he steered his country over a cliff, many observers puzzled over how a leader once considered principled, intelligent and incorruptible could have descended so far and so quickly. But the seeds of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ruinous reign were there almost from the start.\n\nA rebel rises to power\n\nThe son of a carpenter, Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born on Feb. 21, 1924, in the village of Kutama in what was then the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.\n\nHe was educated in Jesuit missionary schools and in 1951 graduated from South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare, Nelson Mandela\u2019s alma mater and the incubator for a generation of activists who led the struggle against white-minority regimes throughout southern Africa. (Mr. Mugabe later earned several other degrees, some while in prison.)\n\nHe returned to Rhodesia in 1960 and joined the Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union, the dominant black liberation movement led by Joshua Nkomo. But stifled by Nkomo\u2019s autocratic leadership, Mr. Mugabe and a group of insurgents walked out three years later to form the rival ZANU-PF.\n\n\n\nRobert Mugabe during a meeting with President Jimmy Carter in the Oval Office on Aug. 27, 1980. (Barry Thumma/AP)\n\nRhodesia\u2019s white-minority government under Prime Minister Ian Smith defied the winds of change that swept across Africa in the early 1960s and unilaterally declared its independence from Britain in 1965, locking up thousands of political opponents. Mr. Mugabe spent more than 10 years in prison without trial. While he was incarcerated, his young son died in 1966 of a form of malaria, and he was denied permission to attend the funeral.\n\nIn 1972, the conflict between Smith\u2019s government and the black opposition erupted into a full-scale civil war in which more than 30,000 people died. When Mr. Mugabe was released in 1974 in one of several abortive peace efforts, he joined his comrades in the bush. A self-declared Marxist, Mr. Mugabe was considered a shy, somewhat bookish intellectual, in marked contrast with his hardened comrades.\n\nLike many liberation movements, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s was a hothouse of suspicion and betrayal. Many members died under mysterious circumstances, sometimes at the hands of white assassins, other times by the long knives of their comrades. As leader, Mr. Mugabe rode the back of a tiger; had he ever fallen off, he, too, in all likelihood would have been devoured.\n\n[One year after Mugabe\u2019s historic ouster, Zimbabwe looks much the same]\n\nHe developed a sharp contempt for the British government, which was unable to bring Smith\u2019s regime to heel; for the Soviet Union, which backed his rival, Nkomo, during the liberation struggle; and for the West in general, whose sanctions campaign against Rhodesia was halfhearted and ineffective.\n\nSmith\u2019s putative allies in South Africa, fearing that the conflict was destabilizing the region, finally forced his government into peace talks. Mr. Mugabe emerged from exile and won a decisive majority in the country\u2019s first free election in 1980, the year the country became known as Zimbabwe.\n\nHe came to power \u2014 as prime minister and, starting in 1987, as president \u2014 initially pledging to bury old animosities.\n\n\u201cIf yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds you to me and me to you,\u201d he solemnly told his countrymen on April 18, 1980. Still, even in those early days, he warned that \u201cthe open hand of reconciliation, if rejected, could turn into a clenched fist.\u201d\n\nDevolution of a nation\n\nParanoia was one legacy of the war. Mr. Mugabe, as elected leader, characterized political opponents as \u201cenemies,\u201d freely used detention without trial and other emergency powers that he inherited from the white regime, and intimidated opponents in his drive for a one-party state.\n\nEach year, he sent several thousand soldiers \u2014 spearheaded by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade \u2014 into southwestern Matabeleland, Nkomo\u2019s ethnic and political stronghold, ostensibly to root out armed dissidents. The main victims of these campaigns, which killed several thousand people, were minority Ndebeles.\n\nNkomo eventually submitted, folding his party into Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ruling organization in return for an end to the brutal attacks against his followers.\n\nMr. Mugabe struggled at times to placate various blocs within his power base, the country\u2019s Shona-speaking majority. Divisions within these blocs were geographic and tribal as well as ideological. Mr. Mugabe worked to hold together a consensus in part through dispensing jobs and patronage to his allies and targeting common enemies, real and imagined.\n\nHe singled out Zimbabwe\u2019s small gay community, among other groups, denouncing homosexuals as \u201clower than dogs and pigs\u201d and ordering the expulsion of a gay organization from the Zimbabwe International Book Fair in 1995. He claimed that homosexuality had been unknown in Africa before European colonization and blamed it for the AIDS crisis when, in fact, heterosexual activity was the main cause of AIDS in Africa.\n\n\n\nRobert Mugabe and wife Grace leave the Kutama Catholic Church in Zimbabwe on Aug. 17, 1996, after exchanging their wedding vows. (Howard Burditt/Reuters)\n\nAfter his first wife, the former Sally Hayfron, died in 1992, Mr. Mugabe married his secretary and longtime mistress, Grace Marufu, 41 years his junior. She set a new standard for conspicuous consumption, acquiring the derogatory nickname \u201cGucci Grace\u201d and shattering his reputation for personal honesty. More than one flight of the state-owned Air Zimbabwe was canceled at the last minute so that she and her entourage could fly to Europe for a shopping spree.\n\nMr. Mugabe had three children with Marufu. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nAlthough much of black-ruled Africa suffered bankruptcy and famine, Zimbabwe retained a modest measure of prosperity. Zimbabwe\u2019s farmers not only fed the country\u2019s own rapidly expanding population \u2014 now more than 16 million \u2014 but exported corn and other food to its hungry neighbors. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government instituted health and education programs that lowered the infant mortality rate and increased the number of high school and university graduates.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s uneasy stability began to crumble in the late 1990s as inflation, unemployment and the AIDS epidemic ate away at the country\u2019s social and economic gains. Faced with rising discontent, Mr. Mugabe targeted one of the country\u2019s most visible minority groups: the 4,500 white commercial farmers.\n\nMr. Mugabe dispatched thousands of unemployed war veterans and street thugs to harass the owners and seize their property. The government instituted a \u201cland reform\u201d policy that turned over the most successful farms to the political elite.\n\nProductivity plummeted \u2014 production of corn, Zimbabwe\u2019s main staple, fell by two-thirds \u2014 and the country swung from being a net food exporter to a basket case within a few years. Nearly 1 million black farmworkers and their families lost their jobs and homes, according to a 2008 study by Zimbabwean economists for the U.N. Development Program.\n\nMr. Mugabe\u2019s unbroken string of electoral success ended in February 2000 when voters rejected a draft constitution that would have legitimized his vastly increased power. Four months later, a new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, won 57 of the 120 elected seats in parliament, capturing urban centers throughout the country and falling just short of a majority.\n\nThe government responded with a wave of repression, rounding up opposition leaders and attacking urban demonstrators, while in the countryside armed gangs destroyed the homes and food supplies of opponents.\n\nMr. Mugabe branded his foes as traitors and saboteurs, shut down independent media outlets and undermined the country\u2019s independent judiciary. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was beaten, arrested and charged with plotting to kill Mr. Mugabe \u2014 only later to be acquitted.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s economic and political misery deepened. Basic public services, such as water and sanitation, public schools and hospitals, collapsed, and by 2008 the rate of inflation exceeded 10 million percent. Even many of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s former allies called on him to step down. He was outpolled by Tsvangirai in the 2008 presidential election but refused to cede power.\n\nMr. Mugabe won a sixth term as president after Tsvangirai dropped out of the runoff contest because of threats against his life. But conditions continued to deteriorate so rapidly that Mr. Mugabe was finally forced to accept a power-sharing arrangement with his rival. The aging president retained full control of the security forces and other instruments of state repression.\n\n\n\nRobert Mugabe at the opening ceremony of a United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen on Dec. 15, 2009. (Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)\n\nAs his megalomania and isolation grew, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s rhetoric became more extravagant and bizarre. He accused \u201cgay gangsters\u201d in British Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s government of fomenting political violence. He compared Blair and President George W. Bush to Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler and accused them of waging \u201ca relentless campaign of destabilizing and vilifying my country.\u201d\n\nThe economy plummeted so far that Mr. Mugabe was forced to accept some reforms. Inflation stabilized, average annual growth rates rebounded and the European Union lifted its 12-year-old sanctions while maintaining a travel ban on Robert and Grace Mugabe. Tsvangiriai\u2019s opposition party splintered, paving the way for Mr. Mugabe\u2019s landslide electoral victory in 2013 and an end of power sharing.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s international isolation continued. In 2014, President Barack Obama excluded him and Sudanese leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir \u2014 the latter pursued by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges \u2014 from a 2014 summit in Washington of 50 African leaders. Nonetheless, many Africans applauded Mr. Mugabe\u2019s defiance and viewed him as a champion in the struggle against neocolonialism, and the next year, Mr. Mugabe began his one-year ceremonial role as chairman of the African Union, a body representing many of the continent\u2019s governments.\n\nBack in sole control, Mr. Mugabe sought to clear out potential rivals to Grace Mugabe succeeding him as leader of Zimbabwe. He ousted two successive vice presidents, including Mnangagwa in early November 2017, while naming his wife as head of ZANU-PF\u2019s influential women\u2019s league.\n\nGrace Mugabe\u2019s unstable behavior had increasingly alienated her from party elders. In the summer of 2017, a 20-year-old South African model accused her of beating her with an electrical cord. Grace Mugabe escaped prosecution in South Africa by invoking diplomatic immunity.\n\nFor the generals and the security establishment, Mnangagwa\u2019s ouster \u2014 a government spokesman accused him of \u201cdisloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability\u201d \u2014 appeared to be the last straw. A week later, the army made its move, confining Mugabe to his home in the northern Harare suburbs.\n\nEven while seeking to orchestrate the struggle for succession, Mr. Mugabe had been in steep physical decline for several years. Cameras caught him stumbling down the steps of a dais in February 2015, while later that year he read to parliament the State of the Nation address he had given to the same chamber a few weeks earlier.\n\nBut he clung tenaciously to power even after his ouster from leadership. On the same day the ruling committee of ZANU-PF voted for his dismissal, he gave a rambling and disjointed television address to the nation in which he conceded that changes were needed but initially refused to announce his resignation, prolonging the leadership crisis. He announced his resignation after lawmakers began impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nProud, obstinate and self-righteous to the end, Mr. Mugabe never accepted responsibility for the damage he caused his country. For all his intelligence and cunning, critics said, he never made the jump from running a liberation movement to governing a nation. Instead, he turned one of Africa\u2019s most promising national experiments into one of its most embarrassing failures.\n\nFrankel was The Washington Post\u2019s southern Africa bureau chief, based in Harare.\n\nRead more:\n\nOne year after Mugabe\u2019s historic ouster, Zimbabwe looks much the same\n\nMugabe resigns under military pressure after 37 years as Zimbabwe\u2019s leader", "description": "The champion of the black liberation struggle in Africa rose to political power, then let his nation fall into ruin over a 37-year iron-fisted rule.", "authors": ["Glenn Frankel", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LM3WLFGAYvQbnJyxe0EZIO-PmXY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VBSE4VWQNII6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
