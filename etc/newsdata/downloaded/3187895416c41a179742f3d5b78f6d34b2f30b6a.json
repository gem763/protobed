Futures let traders bet on whether an underlying market such as oil, gold, stocks or currencies will rise or fall.\n\nThe new futures are part of a venture called Bakkt (pronounced \u201cbacked\u201d), whose ultimate goal is to make cryptocurrencies sufficiently transparent and regulated for individuals to use in retail purchases. Bitcoin has failed to gain traction as a tool for payment, in part because of its extreme volatility. If successful, ICE\u2019s futures could make it easier for merchants to protect themselves from swings in bitcoin prices.\n\nInvestors in Bakkt include ICE, Microsoft Corp. \u2019s venture-capital arm and Boston Consulting Group. In addition, Starbucks Corp. has teamed up with Bakkt to develop ways to let customers convert digital assets into dollars for use at its coffee shops.\n\nWith the launch, Atlanta-based ICE is challenging its longtime rival, CME Group Inc., which introduced its own bitcoin futures in December 2017. More than $200 million worth of CME\u2019s bitcoin futures change hands on an average day. Chicago-based CME said Friday that it would expand into bitcoin options early next year.\n\nHistorically, exchanges have struggled to attract trading in new futures contracts after similar contracts have taken off elsewhere. But ICE is betting that a novel contract design will draw businesses to its futures.\n\nTraders who hold the ICE futures until they expire will either be paid in bitcoin or deliver bitcoin to Bakkt to settle their bets. Such a process, called physical delivery, is used in such markets as cattle, metals and cocoa futures, but it is new to bitcoin. Many traders argue that physical delivery ensures a tight link between futures prices and the price of the underlying market.\n\nCME\u2019s bitcoin futures are settled with payments in U.S. dollars, and traders who deal with them don\u2019t have to handle actual digital coins.\n\nBitcoin has more than doubled in value since the beginning of the year and was trading at $10,145 on Friday afternoon. Its rebound is a surprise to many after the collapse of a speculative bubble in bitcoin that peaked in late 2017.\n\n\u201cThe launch of physically settled futures from Bakkt has been one of the main narratives behind the monster bitcoin rally during the first half of the year,\u201d said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at brokerage firm eToro.\n\nSunday\u2019s debut comes after months of delays. Bakkt initially planned to go live last November, but the rollout was repeatedly pushed back as ICE struggled to get regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nOne potential problem for Bakkt is that only a handful of clearing firms, which allow traders to access the futures markets, were expected to support the new contract initially. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for instance, doesn\u2019t plan to clear ICE\u2019s bitcoin futures, according to a person familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking. Goldman is one of the biggest clearing firms in the futures markets, and it clears CME\u2019s contract for some clients.\n\nIn an original WSJ documentary, markets reporter Steven Russolillo ventures to Japan and Hong Kong to explore the universe of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin miners create new units of the digital currency, and they could use ICE\u2019s contract to protect themselves against the risk of bitcoin\u2019s losing value, much as oil producers use futures to hedge crude prices.\n\nBakkt Chief Executive Kelly Loeffler said in an interview that there was substantial interest in ICE\u2019s bitcoin futures among clearing firms, and she expected the number of firms clearing the contract to grow over time.\n\nExpectations for the launch are high largely because of the reputation of ICE and its CEO, Jeffrey Sprecher. Since founding ICE in 2000, Mr. Sprecher has built it into an exchange empire worth around $52 billion by making investments in new technologies. A hallmark has been acquiring futures markets with old-fashioned trading floors and turning them electronic.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you think the bitcoin-futures market will affect U.S. investing?
