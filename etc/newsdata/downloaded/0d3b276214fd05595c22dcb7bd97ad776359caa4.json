The only runner he allowed was Cavan Biggio on a one-out walk in the first inning.\n\nVerlander had previously thrown two no-hitters in the majors, both while with the Detroit Tigers. He pitched a no-hitter at Toronto in 2011 and also accomplished the feat against Milwaukee in 2007.\n\nMLB Stats (@MLBStats) .@JustinVerlander is the first pitcher ever to throw TWO no-hitters in the same road stadium (Rogers Centre). pic.twitter.com/9Iqw2hSOzx\n\nThe Astros-Blue Jays game was scoreless entering the top of the ninth, but Houston plated a pair of runs to ensure Verlander would be credited with the no-hitter.\n\nThe 36-year-old Verlander leads the majors in strikeouts and innings. He tops the AL in ERA and is tied for first in the majors with 17 wins.\n\nVerlander was ejected from his previous start shortly after a close call on a pitch against Tampa Bay.\n\nHe becomes the sixth pitcher in baseball history to throw at least three career no-hitters, joining Nolan Ryan (seven), Sandy Koufax (four), Bob Feller (three), Cy Young (three) and Larry Corcoran (three).\n\n\u201cSome of the guys I\u2019ve idolized,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nAnd it came after a series of near-misses over the years.\n\nVerlander lost a no-hit try in the eighth inning late in 2011, had bids broken in the ninth in 2012 and 2015 and had another attempt spoiled last May in the seventh by Jose Abreu of the White Sox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come so close to the third one so many times,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nOn this afternoon, he brought it home. Verlander threw a season-high 120 pitches, mixing a fastball that reached the upper 90s mph with a sharp curve.\n\nVerlander retired the last 26 hitters in a row. But he still needed help because the game was scoreless going into the last inning \u2013 according to baseball rules, Verlander had to pitch a complete game to get credit for a no-hitter.\n\nThat\u2019s when Canadian-born rookie Abraham Toro stepped up for the AL West leaders. The Astros newcomer hit a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning off Ken Giles that cleared the way for Verlander to complete the no-hitter.\n\nToro made a routine play on Bo Bichette\u2019s grounder to third base for the last out.\n\nVerlander joked the 22-year-old Toro, playing just his eighth game in the majors, was in for quite a nice reward.\n\nThis was the fourth no-hitter in the majors this year. The last one was by the Astros, too, a combined effort from Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini and Chris Devenski against Seattle on 3 August.\n\nOakland\u2019s Mike Fiers and a tandem effort by Taylor Cole and Felix Pena of the Angels accounted for this year\u2019s other gems.\n\nWith the crowd of 24,104 getting to its feet to begin the ninth, Verlander retired Brandon Drury on an easy grounder and struck out Reese McGuire.\n\nAfter that second out, catcher Robinson Chirinos went to the mound for a quick visit with Verlander. The count went full on Bichette, who fouled off a pitch before hitting a bouncer to Toro.\n\nVerlander took a couple hops toward first as he watched Toro field the ball, saw the throw on target and then began the celebration in the middle of the diamond.\n\nNot bad for an ace who was ejected in his previous start. Verlander was tossed last Tuesday at home shortly after a close pitch didn\u2019t go his way against Tampa Bay.\n\nIt was Verlander\u2019s ninth career shutout. This was the 13th no-hitter for the Astros, including one by Ryan.\n\nThe Blue Jays were no-hit for the sixth time. Before Sunday, the last to do it was Seattle\u2019s James Paxton, who became the first Canadian pitcher to throw a big league no-hitter north of the border when he beat the Blue Jays on 8 May 2018.", "description": "Houston right-hander Justin Verlander threw his third career no-hitter, and first with the Astros, on Sunday against the Toronto Blue Jays", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc86c697cf5d5014dc2615474ca0168c25ce6040/0_95_4212_2528/master/4212.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c1e31900bf5800e0a6e6257183c0987b"}
