And, so the questions that he's gonna get and the annoying, nonsense questions about some stuff that happened in a game that's already been done, sure he'll get an apology for that.\"\n\nSherman's apology came after video surfaced seemingly showing Mayfield shaking his hand during the pregame coin toss:\n\nThe 49ers went on to trounce the Browns 31-3. Mayfield struggled to the tune of just 100 passing yards and two interceptions, one of which was secured by Sherman.\n\nSherman added: \"I'll probably reach out to him via text or social media to actually get a hold of him and talk to him ... on the phone. ... He definitely deserves an apology, and that's my bad on that.\"\n\nMonday's game was one of the toughest of Mayfield's career to this point, and this season has been a struggle for him overall.\n\nOn the heels of a strong rookie campaign that saw him throw for 3,725 yards, 27 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, Mayfield has completed just 55.9 percent of his passes for 1,247 yards, four touchdowns and eight picks through five games this season.\n\nThe Browns are also off to a disappointing 2-3 start after many picked them to win the AFC North prior to the season.\n\nCleveland is just one game behind the Baltimore Ravens for first in the AFC North, however, and it holds the tiebreaker over the Ravens after beating them 40-25 in Week 4.\n\nMeanwhile, the 49ers are off to a 4-0 start for the first time since 1990, and Sherman once again looks like an elite corner with two interceptions through four games.", "description": "San Francisco 49ers cornerback  Richard Sherman  expressed remorse Wednesday for saying Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield didn't shake his hand prior to Monday night's game between the Niners and Browns...", "authors": ["Mike"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/247/hi-res-c45278b1fa33c91280ce16f199c7f8bc_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
