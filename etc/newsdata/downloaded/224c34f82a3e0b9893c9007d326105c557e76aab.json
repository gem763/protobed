The U.S. is poised to follow Europe's and Vestager's lead\" \u2014 Senior U.S. tech executive\n\nDuring her current mandate at the Commission, Vestager deployed an approach that was as much political as it was regulatory, putting herself forward as a personable, elephant-knitting everywoman in a series of well-placed media profiles. Her deftness in harnessing the public's growing wariness toward Big Tech and communicating complicated policy in terms people can understand brought her renown beyond the boundaries of the Brussels bubble.\n\nHer emphasis on public diplomacy is likely to serve her well. Where the EU was once alone in its regulatory pushback against Silicon Valley, other countries, mostly notably the United States, have started to follow suit.\n\nSeveral tech executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of ongoing cases with the Commission, admitted that Vestager had successfully changed the narrative, in Europe and elsewhere, about Big Tech, and that other politicians like U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and U.S. President Donald Trump are tapping into similarly grievances in their own fights with these firms.\n\n\"Vestager was the beginning of the techlash,\" said a senior U.S. tech executive, whose company has had repeated dealings with both U.S. and European regulatory authorities. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of ongoing regulatory cases on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The U.S. is poised to follow Europe's and Vestager's lead.\"\n\nTrack record under threat\n\nInsiders expect the Dane to push that advantage as she champions a series of digital legislative proposals planned from early 2020.\n\nThose include efforts to introduce an EU-wide digital tax (in case a global push through the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development fails), place further restrictions on how tech companies can use people's data and chart a new approach to regulating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe have to improve on cybersecurity,\" said von der Leyen when she announced Vestager's new remit. \"We have to work hard on technological sovereignty.\"\n\nWhether the Dane can make a long-lasting impact remains an open question. What\u2019s clear is that she\u2019ll be trying.\n\nTo help her navigate her new role, she appointed Kim J\u00f8rgensen, a fellow Dane and former ambassador to the EU as her head of Cabinet. Vestager will also have an expanded staff \u2014 drawn from both Europe's competition body and the Commission's Secretariat-General \u2014 to handle the ongoing antitrust cases and her wider digital priorities. More senior appointments to her team are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nHer biggest challenge is in the nature of the new part of her brief: charting Europe's digital course.\n\nAs Europe's competition chief, Vestager could afford to be a one-person show, endowed with rare-in-Brussels executive power to enforce antitrust rules and set the region's muscled response to Silicon Valley.\n\nHer new role, though, will require the Dane to work with a wide variety of often-unruly, if not uncooperative, political actors \u2014 MEPs, national governments, industry groups \u2014 a task that will test her ability strike deals and shepherd legislation through the dark woods of EU policymaking.\n\nHer dual role as the region's digital chief and competition czar will also require to balance Europe's digital industrial strategy with its antitrust efforts, potentially putting one side of her operation in conflict with the other. It's a problem she has admitted may arise, but she has said will not affect the Commission's day-to-day oversight of the digital world.\n\n\"It'll be a challenge for Vestager and her team to change their mindset,\" said Linda Griffin, chair of the European Tech Alliance, a trade body whose members include Spotify and Zalando, the German e-commerce giant. \"When you focus on competition, you focus on Big Tech and reducing consumer harm. But she's got to be able to reach out to entrepreneurs to understand what they need.\"\n\nThe competition chief could also face trouble in court.\n\nIn addition to the legal challenge by Ireland and Apple to Vestager's \u20ac13 billion tax ruling, Google has appealed it antitrust fines \u2014 cases that will also be heard during the upcoming Commission.\n\nIf those rulings go against Vestager's original decisions \u2014 high-profile announcements that provided her with global cache to target other tech giants \u2014 it will likely erode her international authority and make it even more difficult for her to revamp the EU's antitrust rules for the digital age.\n\n\"She's been high-profile, but not had a meaningful impact,\" said Stoller of Open Markets Institute. \"I want to see her change something for good.\"", "description": "In new job, EU competition chief\u2019s biggest challenge is her own legacy.", "authors": ["Mark Scott", "Simon Van Dorpe"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/vestager_crop-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
