Admittedly, he had been out of sorts during the match, committing 35 unforced errors in just 25 games as Wawrinka established a 6-4, 7-5, 2-1 lead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut Djokovic had still been competitive, even if he was far from his best. And although he received some medical attention from the trainer at the end of the second set, there was little sign that he was on the point of retirement.\n\nThe contest ended after a double-fault \u2013 Djokovic\u2019s fifth of the match \u2013 which handed Wawrinka an early break of serve in the third set. Djokovic then walked around the net to embrace his opponent. As he left, he gave a sarcastic thumbs-up to his critics in the crowd.\n\nAfterwards, Djokovic confirmed that the left shoulder that had played up during his second-round match against Juan Ignacio Londero \u2013 and which he had claimed was \u201calmost pain-free\u201d when he faced Denis Kudla on Friday \u2013 had flared up again with a vengeance.\n\nDjokovic received treatment for his injured shoulder during the match Credit: USA TODAY Sports\n\nAsked how he had decided when it was time to draw the line, Djokovic replied \u201cYou just know when you know, I guess. When you feel like you're not able to hit the shot anymore.\n\n\u201cThe pain was constant for weeks now,\u201d he added. \u201cSome days higher; some days with less intensity and obviously taking different stuff to kill the pain instantly. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.\u201d\n\nAs for the disappointing reaction of the crowd, Djokovic initially mumbled \u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201d Later in the interview, though, he addressed the subject more thoughtfully.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cLook, I'm not being offended [or] mistreated by anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't really pay too much attention on that. I like to respect others. I hope that others can respect me and my decision. \u201cI'm sorry for the crowd. Obviously they came to see a full match, and just wasn't to be. A lot of people didn't know what's happening, so you cannot blame them\u201d\n\nBecause of its position towards the end of the season, the US Open has thrown up more unexpected winners than other majors, often turning into something of a demolition derby for bashed-up players with a litany of physical complaints.\n\nThis may explain why the last man to defend this title was Roger Federer in 2008. Now many pundits are predicting a final between Federer and Rafael Nadal, who have never faced each other at this tournament before.\n\nBut when one French reporter suggested as much on Twitter, Wawrinka replied at once with a pointed post of his own. \u201cCool to know the final already,\u201d he said. \u201cAre the rest of us going home?\u201d\n\nWawrinka thus progressed to his second major quarter-final of the season. At the French Open in early June, he was beaten by Federer in four entertaining sets. Here he will play Daniil Medvedev, the provocative Russian, who again baited the crowd on Louis Armstong Stadium after beating German qualifier Dominik Koepfer.\n\nFaced with hoots and jeers from the fans, Medvedev told them \"I was painful in my abductor before the match. I thought I'm not going to play. I was painful in my shoulder. I took as much painkillers as I could. And you guys, being against me, you gave me so much energy to win.
