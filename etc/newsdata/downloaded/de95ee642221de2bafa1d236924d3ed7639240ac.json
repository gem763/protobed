Hoye II, an African-American pastor and pro-life activist, was sentenced to 30 days in jail. His \u201ccrime\u201d was standing on a public sidewalk outside an abortion clinic and holding a sign that read: \u201cGod loves you and your baby. Let us help you.\u201d Hoye was arrested because Oakland\u2019s city council in December 2007 passed a law termed the \u201cBubble Ordinance\u201d to protect \u201caccess to reproductive health care facilities.\u201d The ordinance prohibits protesters from approaching within eight feet of women within a 100-foot range of reproductive health clinics if they are \u201cobstructing access\u201d and do not have consent. Eventually, two higher courts exonerated Hoye, one overturning his criminal conviction, another judging that enforcement of the \u201cbubble law\u201d was unconstitutional.\n\nHoye\u2019s story is told in Black and Pro-Life in America: The Incarceration and Exoneration of Walter B. Hoye II, written by Robert W. Artigo and released by a Catholic publisher. A quick search of prominent media shows why that latter one is the case: neither Hoye nor the National Black Pro-Life Coalition, of which he is a member, receive much mainstream media coverage. Neither The Washington Post nor The New York Times nor CNN, among others, reported Hoye\u2019s tale. One will find little if any left-leaning media acknowledgment that there is a black pro-life movement in America, one that includes Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nConsider these stats. There have been more than 50 million abortions in the United States since Roe v. Wade in 1973. The abortion rate for black women is almost four times that of white women. More than 19 million black babies have been aborted since Roe. Broad support for abortion among black leaders like Jesse Jackson, Reverend Al Sharpton, and Maxine Waters is thus self-defeating. It is one of the only identifiable examples in human history of a community\u2019s political leadership supporting a policy that resulted in fewer members of that community, and thus less political power.\n\nPerhaps if the liberal mainstream media\u2014which claims to be deeply concerned with the welfare of the black community\u2014provided a bit more balanced reporting on abortion, and especially its critics, this wouldn\u2019t be so. Since Hoye was arrested, the annual number of abortions in the District has hovered between 1,200 and 2,900, consistently above the national average. This only compounds the black community\u2019s suffering in the midst of a gentrification trend that unduly affects black residents with deep roots in D.C. Yet if the focus of WaPo\u2018s coverage is to be believed, persecution of the LGBTQ community is a more important story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor this reason, among others, we need to become more familiar with stories like that of Hoye. It it is demonstrative, says Artigo, of an American political and legal system \u201cwhich has often failed to fulfill its promise of faith, equal, unbiased treatment toward all, particularly toward black Americans.\u201d The more Americans know that pro-life activism is not limited to a monolithic, largely white evangelical/Catholic alliance, the more they understand it includes members of all races and religious (as well as non-religious) communities, the closer we will come to making it once more illegal.\n\nKelley Beaucar Vlahos, Executive Editor of TAC: Annalena McAfee once said her crossover from newspapers to adult fiction was \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d but she needn\u2019t have worried: Her 2011 debut The Spoiler, sets her thirty-years in the news business off to extraordinary advantage. They say \u201cwrite what you know\u201d\u2014and as we like to boast, journalists know a little about a lot. In The Spoiler, McAfee is able to pour a career of acquired knowledge and her intimate experience in the dizzying world of the London press into a sophisticated satire set on the threshold of the online media revolution.\n\nI came across the book at a sale and was intrigued by the jacket: McAfee had served as the arts and literary editor of the Financial Times and founded and edited the Guardian Review. The Spoiler takes place in 1997, about the time I was leaving newspapers for online reporting, albeit here on the East Coast. She captures the milieu perfectly\u2014the very point at which daily news had already shifted fully into an unabashed tabloid excess, but only a moment before it lurches garrulously onto the World Wide Web.The venality, the sex, drugs, day and night drinking, and especially the cynicism is on full display in this Upstairs, Downstairs treatment of the biz. It\u2019s actually quite arch, but a fun \u201cromp\u201d nonetheless (though as a non-Brit, the speculative resemblances to real characters was sadly, lost on me).\n\nThe sordidly funny tale involves (Dis?)Honor Tait, a 79-year-old Martha Gellhorn character whose decades of war correspondence have placed her in the pantheon of elite, upstanding journalists, but has left her wholly unprepared for the indignities of growing old. Alternately, we meet Tamara Sim (pleton?), an unsympathetic Bridget Jones, who toils away in \u201clists\u201d and celebrity ambushes (i.e. \u201cTop Best Soap Opera Shags\u201d) for the bottom-feeder celebrity gossip/TV listings section of The Monitor. She\u2019s resourceful, young, and willing to cut any corner to break into a full-time gig. She gets her chance, seemingly, with a commission to interview Tait for the much more prestigious Sunday section.\n\nThis set-up also allows McAfee to flex on her other natural source of practical perception: being a woman who has toiled in both lanes, as young and hungry and, if not even close to Miss Havisham territory (she was 59 when she wrote Spoiler and is happily married to British author Ian McEwan), a retired sage amidst an industry that is quite indistinguishable from the one she came up in.\n\nThere is nothing more refreshing (and alarming) than a strong female writer facing age head-on. Margaret Atwood has exhibited this uncanny ability to chart with clear-eyed humor and honesty the twisted humor of time on a woman\u2019s body and self-possession. In Blind Assassin, and then more recently in Stone Mattress, she\u2019s masterful. McAfee\u2019s ability to toggle between Tait\u2019s isolation and regret, and Sim\u2019s naivet\u00e9 and desperation, is a pleasure to read. Her seeming knowledge of both worlds: the intellectual fatuousness of Tait\u2019s heady salons and Sim\u2019s seedy environs, filled with tawdry extra-marital affairs, deadbeats, and parasites, is impressive.\n\nThere is a plot here, and suspense as well. The main characters are alternately sympathetic, pathetic, and cruel. They are headed to an explosive collision. The fun is in how they get there, and wondering who will win out\u2013age or youth, or neither.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tac-bookshelf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
