They go into this one just above the bottom three, such has been their recent fall with the pressure coming on all sides on Silva.\n\nAfter another summer splurge on new players, the Toffees were supposed to threaten breaking into the top six, but that ambition appears wildly misplaced on this evidence and the away fans made their feelings patently clear at the final whistle.\n\nA red card for captain Seamus Coleman before the hour mark hindered their chances, but it was a familiar failing on set-pieces that cost them the game.\n\nJeff Hendrick had already tested Jordan Pickford in the first half with a volley after ghosting unmarked to meet Ashley Westwood\u2019s corner beyond the far post.", "description": "The dark clouds show no sign of dissipating over Everton and manager Marco Silva as the 10-man Toffees fell to a fourth straight Premier League defeat for the first time since January 2015.", "authors": ["Adam Lanigan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212087306_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqq0hXPkI_GX3QDYmEw99JfLEu4odvKfIxFVccPQZWyAc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
