They met at kindergarten three years ago and have been inseparable ever since.\n\nTo display their love, they decided to tie the knot in an unofficial ceremony (don\u2019t worry, this wedding is not actually legally binding, as that would be wrong) at a community college in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair wore full on bride and groom attire and dragged in seven of their closest friends and family members to act as bridesmaids and groomsmen for the photos.\n\nFrankie\u2019s mum Nicole, 38, said: \u2018After they met, Frankie came home and told us all about Aubrey.\n\n\u2018He always referred to her as his best friend in the whole world.\n\nAfter sharing pizza the kids danced and posed for photos (Picture: Dana Lee Photography LLC / Mercury Press)\n\n\u2018One day, Frankie started referring to Aubrey as his girlfriend.\n\n\u2018He was so matter of fact about it, it was incredibly sweet.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll end up getting married when they\u2019re older, but for now we just want them to have fun and experience all the amazing adventures life will bring.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s exactly what this shoot was about \u2013 making precious memories.\u2019\n\nOn their first Valentine\u2019s Day together, Frankie went out and bought a toy unicorn, one fake rose and one real rose for Aubrey. When asked why, the young romantic explained to his mum that the real rose would die one day, but Aubrey would be able to keep the fake one forever.\n\nAfter unofficially tying the knot, it was time for cake (Picture: Dana Lee Photography LLC / Mercury Press)\n\nThree years after they met, Frankie, who is from a Catholic family, had his first Holy Communion in May.\n\nHe was having his photos taken by professional snapper Dana Smith for the celebration when he asked whether she\u2019d be able to take photos of him and Aubrey all dressed up when they were older.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDana and Nicole fell in love with the idea and, together with Aubrey\u2019s mum Amanda, came up with the idea of a mock wedding.\n\nThe kids enjoyed pizzas together before getting into position for the photos.\n\nAfter posing for pictures they enjoyed their own wedding cake.\n\nThere was one tradition that had to be kept though: the wedding cake.\n\nAubrey\u2019s mum Amanda, 35, a registered nurse and mum-of-two, said: \u2018We just wanted the children to have fun and while some of the snaps were staged, most were just taken while they played together.\n\n\u2018They absolutely loved spending the day playing dress up.\u2019\n\nMORE: Quiz: What should you dress up as for Halloween?\n\nMORE: What it\u2019s like to get in trouble at work because of social media\n\nMORE: Dying man marries love of his life in wedding ceremony with every detail donated\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Frankie Miller, nine, and his 'girlfriend' Aubrey Butterly, eight, have stubbornly declared that they will one day get married for real.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88948260_1570893841.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
