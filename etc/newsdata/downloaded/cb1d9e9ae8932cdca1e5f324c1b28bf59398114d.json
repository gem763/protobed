I want to be my own thing, the ultimate bimbo and my own gender.\"", "description": "Adult entertainer James Holt, from Manchester, has fillers every month to create a more feminine look", "authors": ["Alyce Collins", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "James Holt"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561218.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cash-Pig-Bimbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
