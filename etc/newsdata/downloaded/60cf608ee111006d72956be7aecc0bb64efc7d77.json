He has requested a jury trial and judgment to be determined.\n\nThe libel suit stems from a case brought against Mr. Jones in Connecticut by lawyers for relatives of victims killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Mr. Jones previously referred to the massacre as a \u201choax,\u201d leading attorneys for the victims\u2019 relatives to sue him for defamation.\n\nMr. Jones, 45, said in June that lawyers representing plaintiffs in the Sandy Hook case found child porn in emails that his attorneys had shared during the pretrial discovery phase. Federal investigators have since concluded that the emails had been sent to Infowars and were not opened prior to being provided to the plaintiffs, Mr. Barnes wrote in the complaint.\n\nThe Young Turks and Ms. Wu each said on social media that Mr. Jones sent the child porn. They were subsequently asked to retract the remarks and were sued when they refused, according to Ms. Barnes.\n\n\u201cDefendants knowingly falsely accused Jones of a federal felony of the most public infamy: possessing & transmitting child pornography directly to the families of the victims of a school shooting. Defendants knew Jones never possessed it, never transmitted it, was not even the party providing the email discovery, and nothing was ever sent to Sandy Hook victim families,\u201d Mr. Barnes wrote in the complaint.\n\nMs. Wu indicated in a statement posted on Twitter that she plans to fight the lawsuit, tweeting: \u201cIf the Sandy Hook parents can stand up to Alex Jones, I can too.\u201d\n\nThe Young Turks did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment.\n\nMr. Jones, a radio host and internet publisher based in Austin, Texas, achieved notoriety in 2018 after being banned from several major internet platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, amid complaints about his comments involving Sandy Hook and other subjects. He famously interviewed President Trump on his talk show in 2015 and has frequently collaborated with Roger Stone, Mr. Trump\u2019s indicted former election campaign adviser.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
