The wrongdoing was concentrated at EOH Mthombo, it added. An EOH spokesperson told ITWeb that EOH Mthombo will be closed within two years following the revelations.\n\nAccording to Terra Analytics' website, it \"was founded to enhance decision-making through advanced data visualisation\" and it works towards solving \"earth science problems\".\n\nThe deal is still subject to certain conditions. It is not, however, subject to the approval of EOH shareholders.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Business Insider reported that under a new plan put to shareholders by EOH, non-executive directors were set to get fee increases of 40% for specialised meetings and a minimum of 20% more for ordinary meetings. The extra fees were required to clean up \"legacy governance issues\", according to the company.\n\nCompiled by Marelise van der Merwe", "description": "EOH Mthombo is disposing of its 100% interest in the Data World Group to help settle its debts following an investigation into suspicious transactions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6880/48ec4b6445804daeb26d85ca8a01718a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
