Though the changes have been abandoned by the government, the unrest has continued, expanding into demands for greater democracy.\n\nThe shooting of Tsang Chi-kin, who was attacking an officer with a pole, was captured on video and shared online.\n\n\"My chest is hurting, I need to go to hospital,\" the 18-year-old said. The government said he was in a stable condition.\n\nAlthough people have been shot with rubber bullets in previous protests, this was the first injury from a live round.\n\nMr Lo said firing the bullet was \"lawful and reasonable\" as the officer thought his and colleagues' lives were under threat.", "description": "One protester was shot in the chest, and more than 180 people were arrested during battles with police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ptg3l.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
