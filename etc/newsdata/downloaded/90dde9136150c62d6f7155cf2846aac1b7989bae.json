The sophomore session\u2019s international box office is estimated at $123.7M in 79 markets. That reps a 29% drop from opening, and brings the offshore tally to $351.2M after only 12 days in release. Globally, the Todd Phillips-directed origins story danced past the half-billion mark with $543.9M through Sunday.\n\nIn Europe, the Joaquin Phoenix-starrer has already surpassed the lifetime cumes of Logan, Justice League and Wonder Woman. In Asia, Arthur Fleck has flown by Logan, The Dark Knight and It Chapter Two. And, in Latin America, the run is currently on par with Batman V Superman, and over Justice League (+15%), Wonder Woman (+62%) and Venom (+68%) while also more than double The Dark Knight.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nNew openers included France which was a $10.3M start from 630 screens and with a 71% share of the Top 5 films. This is the biggest opening of 2019 for WB in the market and the 2nd best ever for DC (behind The Dark Knight Rises). Likewise, Germany hit similar benchmarks with $9.3M from 912 screens.\n\nThe top hubs so far are the UK ($36.9M), Mexico ($28.9M), Korea ($28M), Russia ($20.4M) and Brazil ($18M).\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount/Skydance\u2019s Gemini Man added $31.1M in 58 markets after a small early rollout last session. Including the 53 new openings this weekend, the offshore cume is $39M in 85% of the international footprint. The high-frame-rate pic from Ang Lee saw 26% of its grosses come in 3D+ and reps Lee\u2019s best launch result in 25 markets. Globally, the Will Smith-starrer is at $59.5M.\n\nFaced with the zeitgeist-y Joker, Gemini Man came in largely at No. 2s or lower in its debuts this session. Mexico and Russia led with $2.7M each. France, which bowed last weekend, saw a decent hold and leads all play at $5.1M.\n\nWhile Smith proved again he can be a big draw overseas with this summer\u2019s surprise Aladdin success, the fact that the technologically envelope-pushing Gemini Man is more story-based than action-driven is a hindrance in some offshore markets and the high frame rate is still jarring for some audiences. As Anthony has noted, we\u2019re told the movie would need to gross $275M worldwide to reach break-even, which would occur two years after all material ancillary markets play out. That isn\u2019t looking likely. However, risk was spread with financing between Paramount (35%), Skydance (35%), Alibaba (5%) and Fosun (25%).\n\nStill to come are markets that lean into Lee and Smith including China, Taiwan and Japan. We understand Smith, who has been very active on social with the film, is due to visit China and Japan. In China, where 25% flows back to the production, there will be some competition as Gemini will share screens with Disney\u2019s Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil next weekend. There are school/national holidays in a number offshore markets this week so we\u2019ll see how Gemini Man holds and expands.\n\nAlso of note, DreamWorks Animation/Pearl Studios\u2019 Abominable trekked across the $100M global mark, despite an underperformance in China and with France still to come.\n\nFocus/Carnival\u2019s Downton Abbey hit a new milestone, breaking the $150M barrier worldwide while the UK topped $30M. This is ahead of releases (via Universal) in Italy, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan.\n\nBreakdowns on the films above and more have been updated below.\n\nHOLDOVERS/EXPANSIONS\n\nJOKER\n\nAfter breaking out last weekend in serious fashion, Warner Bros/Village Roadshow/Bron Studios\u2019 Joker saw a mere 29% drop in holdover markets. It has grabbed the zeitgeist and become a must-see after its Venice Golden Lion win which helped position the not-quite-a-superhero-movie as an awards-season hybrid. Curiosity is out there.\n\nThe sophomore session was worth $123.7M on on 24,149 screens in 79 markets. That takes the overseas cume to $351.2M through Sunday and after only 12 days in release. Globally, this well-priced pic is now at $543.9M.\n\nJoker is not expected to see a China release, though social media there is giving it high scores. How high it goes overall will depend on the continued offshore play. Its must-see factor thwarted Gemini Man internationally as well as domestically. Upcoming next weekend is Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil which targets a different demo but will also take some screens.", "description": "UPDATE,writethru: After arriving with a massive jolt last weekend, Warner Bros/Village Roadshow/Bron Studios\u2019 Joker maintained a serious grip on audiences this frame.
