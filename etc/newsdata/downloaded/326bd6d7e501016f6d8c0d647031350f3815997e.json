Caroline Nokes, the former immigration minister, has also had the whip restored\n\nRichard Benyon (left) intends to stand down at the next election. Stephen Hammond had floated the possibility of standing as an independent\n\nBoth Margot James and Steve Brine had the Tory whip restored this evening\n\nRichard Harrington, the former business minister, said he will step down at the next election. Ed Vaizey, a former culture minister, intends to stand again\n\nAt least four of the rebels who have had the whip restored have said they will step down at the next election: Mr Burt, Sir Nicholas, Mr Harrington and Mr Benyon.\n\nBut for the others who want to continue their political career, this evening's decision represent a welcome development and massively increases their hopes of re-election.\n\nSome had signalled that they would fight as independent candidates but now they will be able to campaign under the official Conservative banner.\n\nA Conservative spokesman said following this evening's meeting: 'They are Conservative members of Parliament with the Tory whip.\n\n'They have had the whip restored and they will be treated as Conservative members of Parliament.'\n\nThe spokesman said the decision to readmit the 10 rebels had been made following 'discussions between the chief whip and individual MPs'.\n\nThe decision to restore the whip to the 10 rebels raises major questions about what will happen to the remaining 11 who as it stands will not be able to contest the next election as Tory candidates.\n\nThose 11 are: Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond, Guto Bebb, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Sir Oliver Letwin, Anne Milton, Antoinette Sandbach and Rory Stewart.\n\nMr Gyimah is no longer in the equation because he has defected to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Stewart has said he intends to quit Westminster in order to contest the 2020 London mayoral election as an independent candidate.\n\nA number of the 11 - including Ms Greening, Mr Clarke and Sir Oliver - have said they intend to stand down.\n\nBut for the others who do want to retain their status as an MP there are still major question marks about their respective futures.\n\nPhilip Hammond and Dominic Grieve are among the 11 former Tory rebels who have not had the party whip restored\n\nSir Oliver Letwin who has led rebel MP efforts to stop a No Deal Brexit has not had the whip restored\n\nGuto Bebb will step down at the next election as will Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor\n\nJustine Greening, a former education seretary and MP for Putney, is stepping down but David Gauke wants to stand again. Neither have had the Tory whip restored\n\nSam Gyimah was one of the original 21 Tory rebels but he has now defected and joined the Lib Dems\n\nAntoinette Sandbach, pictured left, and Anne Milton, pictured right, have both been kept out in the cold by Mr Johnson\n\nRory Stewart is stepping down as an MP to contest the London mayoral election in 2020 as an independent candidate\n\nThe original decision to expel the 21 Tory MPs following a crunch vote at the start of September sparked a political firestorm.\n\nMr Johnson faced intense pressure from his own backbenches as senior Conservative figures demanded that the MPs be given the whip back.\n\nMany were particularly concerned at the expulsion of Sir Nicholas as they asked what had happened to the Conservative Party if it no longer had room for the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\nThe decision to readmit the 10 rebels could also cause some political embarrassment to Mr Johnson during the imminent general election campaign given that some have been publicly critical of his leadership.\n\nFor example, Ms James, the MP for Stourbridge, recently suggested the Conservatives were not fit to run the country.\n\nIn a September 4 interview with a local paper discussing the Tory and Labour electoral chances she said: \u2018At the moment I don\u2019t think either party is fit to win an overall majority and govern the country.\n\n\u2018The public would be taking a great risk on either of them in their current state.'", "description": "Boris Johnson has restored the Tory whip to 10 of the 21 former Conservative rebels who were expelled after backing a bid to block a No Deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20344738-0-image-a-105_1572380112982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
