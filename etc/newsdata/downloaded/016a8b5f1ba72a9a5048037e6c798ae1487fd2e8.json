El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, half of the infamous British cell of ISIS executioners known by the Western captives as \u201cThe Beatles,\u201d had been taken from a Kurdish prison into U.S. custody, President Trump announced on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey are the worst of the worst!\u201d\n\nElsheikh and Kotey, who have reportedly been moved to Iraq, allegedly belonged to an ISIS cell that beheaded seven American, British and Japanese prisoners and a group of Syrian soldiers, filming the killings for ISIS propaganda. They\u2019ve been stripped of their British citizenship and could face the death penalty if found guilty in a U.S. court.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement came after Turkey launched its ground and air offensive into Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria Wednesday, sparking an exodus of thousands of Kurdish civilians who fled the border region. Fighting was heaviest around the towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain, with at least 16 Kurds killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said Thursday.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Ministry of Defense said the operation had achieved its targets to date. \u201cOperation continues successfully as planned,\" it tweeted Thursday morning.\n\nREAD: Turkey\u2019s offensive against the Kurds is underway and already deadly\n\nTrump has faced a fierce backlash for effectively greenlighting the Turkish invasion. Critics slammed the move as a shameless betrayal of the Kurds, a key ground partner in the fight against ISIS, which also raised serious concerns that the estimated 80,000 ISIS fighters and their families in Kurdish custody could break free amid the renewed conflict.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly urged European nations to repatriate and prosecute imprisoned ISIS fighters, initially said the continued detention of the ISIS detainees would be Turkey\u2019s responsibility.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s pullout from northern Syria is a disaster for the Kurds and a gift to ISIS\n\nBut on Wednesday, he acknowledged they could go free amid the invasion, and appeared to wash his hands of the situation.\n\nAsked at a press conference if he was concerned about ISIS fighters fleeing Kurdish custody, Trump said: \u201cWell they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That's where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Wednesday that one of the prisons where ISIS detainees were being held was hit by a Turkish air strike, while the Guardian reported that ISIS women in the sprawling Al-Hawl camp were hopeful that ISIS sleeper cells would launch an attack to break them out in the coming days. The terror group has repeatedly broken its members out of jails in the past.\n\nSpeaking to the press Wednesday, Trump also downplayed the U.S. relationship with the Kurds, who have played a key role in defeating ISIS on the ground, losing 11,000 soldiers in the fight.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are fighting for their land,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example... But they were there to help us with their land, and that\u2019s a different thing.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWith all of that being said we like the Kurds.\u201d\n\nCover: In this photo taken from the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria, in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, smoke billows from targets inside Syria during bombardment by Turkish forces Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019.
