Jim Himes James (Jim) Andres HimesDemocrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Intelligence watchdog huddles with members as impeachment push grows Five notable moments from the whistleblower complaint hearing MORE (D-Conn.), a member of the Intelligence panel, said Democrats are getting plenty of help from the president himself as they pursue their impeachment probe. He pointed to Trump\u2019s entreaty Thursday for both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cEvery day that goes by the president further implicates himself. Yesterday, publicly, he asked the Chinese for help,\u201d Himes said. \u201cThe more we learn, the more we learn that everything that was in that whistleblower's complaint has corroboration.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, called for more details from Schiff following a New York Times report this week saying the whistleblower reached out to a member of Schiff\u2019s staff before filing the complaint. The staffer suggested the whistleblower find a lawyer and meet with an inspector general to file a complaint.\n\n\u201cThe only way that we will be able to get that information is from the [Intelligence Committee] majority themselves. They are fact witnesses in the same investigation that they are now running,\u201d said Rep.

Peter Welch Peter Francis WelchDemocrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Intelligence watchdog huddles with members as impeachment push grows Senators call for more automakers to join emissions deal with California MORE (D-Vt.), another member of the Intelligence Committee, also pushed back against the GOP\u2019s process criticisms \u2014 but from a different angle. The identity and credibility of the whistleblower is essentially insignificant, he argued, if the allegations the source proffered have already been confirmed by the White House\u2019s own public summary of the Zelensky call.\n\n\u201cThe questions that a lot of my Republican colleagues had went to the credibility of the whistleblower and a lot of the process things. But that's all been bypassed by the fact that the White House released the readout of the ... conversation,\u201d Welch said.\n\n\u201cThe credibility of the whistleblower and the IG report have been solidly confirmed in the readout of the discussion between our president and the president of Ukraine,\u201d he added.\n\nThe briefing with the inspector general marked the end of a whirlwind week for the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt also came a day after Trump openly encouraged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThey should investigate the Bidens,\u201d Trump said of the Ukrainian government while speaking to reporters Thursday. \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans have remained silent or defended Trump\u2019s public comments.

It\u2019s unclear when the other officials requested for depositions, including Sondland, might appear.\n\nOn Wednesday, the three committees released a draft subpoena that was formally issued Friday for the White House to hand over documents related to Trump\u2019s calls with the Ukrainian president, efforts to conceal those calls and the discussions about withholding aid to Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, the committees sent a letter to Vice President Pence requesting documents related to his involvement in Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nDemocrats seized on the text messages provided by Volker as evidence that Trump administration officials pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and made it a condition for a White House visit.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House - assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker wrote in one message.\n\nLater on, Taylor is shown expressing alarm over withheld U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn an exchange on Sept. 9, Taylor said: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nSondland replied that he believed Taylor was \"incorrect about President Trump's intentions.\"\n\n\"The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign,\" Sondland said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, escalated his attacks on Schiff on Friday evening by tweeting a video that opens with an image of Pinocchio.\n\n\u201cLYIN\u2019 SHIFTY SCHIFF!\u201d Trump wrote.", "description": "Democrats claimed to find new momentum Friday in their impeachment inquiry into President Trump after the top watchdog of the nation's intelligence community briefed lawmakers on his investigation into allegations that Trump sought foreign help to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/atkinsonmichael_100419gn7_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
