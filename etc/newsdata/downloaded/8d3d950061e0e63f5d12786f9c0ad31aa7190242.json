But the morning after winning the world heptathlon title \u2013 and smashing Jessica Ennis-Hill\u2019s British record in the process \u2013 she had a confession to make: there was a moment when she nearly gave up on the event.\n\nWho could have blamed her? For so long the 26-year-old was the bridesmaid but never the bride at a world championships or Olympic Games. And she had so many setbacks, injuries and plunges into sinkholes of self-doubt while competing in the heptathlon that after the Rio Games in 2016 \u2013 where poor shot put and javelin performances cost her a medal \u2013 she wondered whether she should just stick to the long jump or high jump.\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson says she \u2018tore everything up\u2019 to win world title Read more\n\n\u201cIt was probably in the moment at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI was fed up of not doing a victory lap because I was injured and knowing that my body could not respond, or feeling it couldn\u2019t make it through, or that my performances were not up to scratch to compete.\n\n\u201c I changed my life after that competition. I didn\u2019t want to give up on something I truly believed.\u201d\n\nJohnson-Thompson estimated she had barely an hour\u2019s sleep after winning gold as she tried to process how she had managed to not only become the first person to lower the colours of Belgium\u2019s Olympic champion Nafi Thiam since May 2016 \u2013 but beat her by more than 300 points while setting four personal bests.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s relief, going into my fourth world championships that something bad hasn\u2019t happened again,\u201d she added, smiling. \u201cI knew I was in good shape, but in the past I\u2019ve been in good shape and it hasn\u2019t always come off. It was just about not letting myself get carried away until the last minute.\u201d\n\nIt was only afterwards, when she crossed the line and hugged her mum, Tracey, that so many bottled-up emotions began to flow.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to cry but it was definitely good tears,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve cried enough now to last me a career. From now it\u2019s just going to be smiles, hopefully.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jessica Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson at the Rio Games in 2016.

She had little grasp of the language or culture but knew she was moving to a world-renowned group run by Bertrand Valcin, that includes Kevin Mayer, the 2017 decathlon world champion. It took her a while to settle in, and she still has only a smattering of French, but she is comfortable cycling to training and getting to the beach more easily after training now Montpellier has embraced Uber. More importantly she has become a more rounded and less injury-prone athlete.\n\n\u201cI used to want certain scores,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted two metres in the high jump, seven metres in the long jump, 7,000 points in the heptathlon. I was going after them and getting close to them but it wasn\u2019t helping me in a heptathlon as a whole. I feel moving to France made me a better athlete. I levelled out almost, didn\u2019t get many PBs but my heptathlon PB was going up.\n\n\u201cThis year I had no injuries and with confidence and continuous training I was able to get PBs.\u201d\n\nThe other great change was how Johnson-Thompson handled the pressures of competition. Once upon a time she carried the apprehensions of someone about to go on a white-knuckle ride for the first time. In Doha, though, she seemed to relish going head-to-head with Thiam, who is widely recognised as the greatest female athlete in any sport.\n\n\u201cBertrand\u2019s demeanour in competition is very calming,\u201d Johnson-Thompson said. \u201cI feel like our personalities match really quite well. It\u2019s just week-in, week-out, doing good things in training, going through all the different events each week. Bruno [Gajer], my running coach, is also really good to have around. It\u2019s just the combination of everything.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Mayer\u2019s words came to mind during the third event \u2013 the shot put \u2013 after two poor throws left her needing to produce on her final attempt. \u201cHe\u2019s a great competitor and he\u2019s helped me,\u201d said Johnson-Thompson. \u201cHe talked with me about third attempts because a lot of stuff was done on third attempts for his world record.\n\nDina Asher-Smith sets sights on being all-time great after Doha 200m triumph Read more\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve had two bad attempts in the shot put in the past I\u2019ve thought: \u2018This is the level I\u2019m at today\u2019 and it\u2019s stayed that way. But it\u2019s knowing you can change at any point.\u201d In Doha she threw a PB of 13.86m with her final attempt.\n\nEven her imposter syndrome, a feeling of self-doubt, seems to be behind her. \u201cIn the long jump I was scared for my first attempt but I\u2019m able to switch off a bit.\u201d\n\nNot everything, though, has changed drastically since her move to France. Her mum still brings home-cooked meals to stick in the freezer as well as FaceTiming her in Liverpool to help make her own meals in Montpellier.\n\nJohnson-Thompson\u2019s best friend is the Killing Eve star Jodie Comer, whom she met at St Julie\u2019s Catholic High School in Liverpool. When asked if she had been helped by her friend recently winning an Emmy, she smiled, before saying: \u201cNot in the heptathlon, no.\u201d But when pressed, she added: \u201cJodie is smashing life completely. She\u2019s an incredible actress and I\u2019m so happy she\u2019s getting recognition. But in order to do heptathlon I had to focus on me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jodie Comer at Ascot last year.

Soak it all up. You\u2019re the best \u2026 it\u2019s actually official (always has been).\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson-Thompson stands on top of the world, she expects Thiam, who had an elbow injury for much of this year, to come back hard at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. \u201cShe\u2019s always on the brink of something special,\u201d admitted Johnson-Thompson. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to step up. She\u2019s proved she can get 7,000 points and I expect her to do that next year. This is the best position I\u2019ve been in \u2013 gold medal, injury-free, national record but I know what it\u2019s like to finish second,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou want to prove yourself and it will be a dangerous Nafi I will be competing against next year.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming sense, though, is that Johnson-Thompson is ready for that next stage, ready to get back up for whatever their compelling rivalry can throw at her in Tokyo.", "description": "The heptathlete has suffered more than her fair share of injuries and major championships heartbreak but it all came right in Doha to spectacular effect", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1218e411f635bdbadc9ae06ab0dc14628f9eb37/0_24_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6cdfecb94589e6bb9215fb0114d5a024", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
