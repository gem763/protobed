Given how popular these warm-weather finds were, we couldn\u2019t wait to see what Amazon had in store for the fall.\n\nWe recently discovered a $35 teddy coat with 1,000 reviews, but we were eager to find a dress we could wear on repeat all autumn long. We think we\u2019ve finally found it.\n\nThe $25 R.Vivimos Tie-Waist Sweater Dress has a 4.4-star rating and more than 300 reviews, making it one of the early standout fashion finds for fall. It\u2019s made of a cotton, polyester and spandex blend and is available in sizes S through XL and in 11 fall-friendly colors like olive green and ruby red. This long-sleeve dress has an A-line silhouette that you cinch at the waist with faux tie-front sleeves, so it\u2019s a flattering shape and warm enough to pair with ankle booties on breezy early-fall days.\n\nThe dress can easily be dressed down with knee-high boots and a denim jacket for pumpkin picking or jazzed up with sheer tights and high-heel booties for a holiday party.\n\nAmazon This tie-waist dress comes in 11 fall-friendly colors.", "description": "Many of its 300-plus reviews say it's the perfect outfit for holiday parties.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8151453b0000c49fd66ac7.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
