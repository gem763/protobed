The Nasdaq Composite was down 118.36 points, or 1.46%, at 7,994.11.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 hit a two-week low.\n\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy sector down 1.8%, tracking a drop in oil prices.\n\nOnly the defensive consumer staples and utilities sectors were higher.\n\nVideo streaming platform Netflix Inc dropped 4% to a near nine-month low after Pivotal Research cut its price target.\n\nNike Inc fell 0.9%, ahead of the world's largest sportswear maker's first-quarter results after the bell.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.20-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 31 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 36 new highs and 83 new lows.
