(He\u2019s also suing a few other tabloids like The Sun and and the Daily Mirror for separate reasons.) It\u2019s all an effort to protect Meghan from intense and oftentimes unfair scrutiny. But even though Harry was reportedly advised to wait until after his latest tour to release the letter, he did it anyway. So now, he\u2019s allegedly in hot water with other members of the royal family and the royal household.\n\nAccording to Daily Express royal correspondent Richard Palmer, \u201cNobody in the Royal Family or the Royal Household is supporting Harry and Meghan at the moment.\u201d Palmer went even further and tweeted, \u201cEven the couple\u2019s aides seem embarrassed by their actions. William, who dropped his brother like a ton of hot bricks earlier this year, and Charles have distanced themselves.\u201d\n\nNobody in the Royal Family or the Royal Household is supporting Harry and Meghan at the moment. Even the couple\u2019s aides seem embarrassed by their actions. William, who dropped his brother like a ton of hot bricks earlier this year, and Charles have distanced themselves. \u2014 Richard Palmer (@RoyalReporter) October 7, 2019\n\nPalmer also called Harry\u2019s letter \u201cinflammatory\u201d and said he and Meghan \u201cappear out on a limb\u201d at the moment.\n\nObviously, if that changes it will be a story but at the moment the Sussexes appear out on a limb. Whatever the merits of their various legal actions, they didn\u2019t inform their family that Harry was going to release that inflammatory statement. \u2014 Richard Palmer (@RoyalReporter) October 8, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Harry chose to release the letter when he did, but there are theories that it all comes down to a new provision that will soon change where media cases are held in court. Allegedly, Harry wanted to file the suit before the location changed from a division that\u2019s more sympathetic to high-profile privacy issues (Chancery Division) to a division that\u2019s typically sympathetic to publishers (Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court).\n\nUltimately, the royals have declined to comment on the matter, and we\u2019ll all just have to wait and see how this shakes out.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It has everything to do with that lawsuit letter.", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qw.Ifn32LhuUJ1881TX3Sw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/ff9774bf18e85dc3827a247053a74a51", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
