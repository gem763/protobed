He said he\u2019d cross the street if he saw \u201ca black kid in a hoodie\u201d late at night. He praised former Clippers owner Donald Sterling years after Sterling\u2019s racist and sexist practices had come to light.\n\nNow we\u2019re hearing Cuban \u2013 in a page straight from Sterling\u2019s playbook \u2013 heckled his own player during games.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLamar Odom had a miserable 2011-12 season in Dallas. He handled personal issues by abusing drugs, played poorly and even later apologized to Cuban. In his new book, Odom details Cuban\u2019s profane heckles.\n\nOdom said Cuban also once went beyond verbal degradation.\n\nOdom, via D Magazine:\n\nDuring one homestand, I was having possibly the worst game of the season. Head coach Rick Carlisle subbed me out, and I looked for a seat near the coaches, but none were available. So I went down to the only open seat at the end of the bench. Right next to Cuban. Cuban extended his right foot and kicked my shin. \u201cCome on, motherf[\u2014]er!\u201d he shouted. I was stunned. This wasn\u2019t a tap. I felt it. That was the last straw. It was painfully clear he did not respect me as a man.\n\nThis might get brushed off because it was so long ago and because Odom has become gossip-page fodder. Reality-TV stars generally don\u2019t get taken seriously.\n\nBut the NBA should investigate Odom\u2019s claim.\n\nLook at the wrath Warriors minority Mark Stevens (rightfully) received for pushing Kyle Lowry during the NBA Finals. We now recognize that as inexcusable, and this sounds even worse.\n\nMaybe Cuban remembers the story differently. He deserves a chance to defend himself.\n\nBut this should receive deeper attention.", "description": "The NBA should investigate Odom's claim.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u58vSFMXuwgNw6D5nCITuA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTExODg7aD02Njg-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HEbamC17R5k9lvcHGXcpMQ--~B/aD0zMzQ7dz01OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/8376d41910187eb931fbbdc749964821", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
