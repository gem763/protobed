Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union was stopped from discussing the administration\u2019s Ukraine dealings ahead of a scheduled closed-door hearing Tuesday morning.\n\nThe move marks the first test for Democrats as they seek to compel witness testimony about whether President Trump sought to withhold military aid in exchange for Ukraine leaders investigating political rival Joseph R. Biden.\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly threatened to bring obstruction of justice as an impeachment article if the White House blocks key testimony.\n\nThe White House decision to block Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony came only hours before he was set to appear.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairmen Adam B. Schiff said it was hard to overstate the importance of Mr. Sondland as a witness.\n\n\u201cWe will consider this act today \u2026 as well as the withholding of the ambassador\u2019s documents as well as efforts to discourage or have the effect of discouraging other state department witnesses from coming forward and testifying to be further acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\nMr. Schiff also accused the State Department of withholding from Congress relevant text messages that Mr. Sondland has stored on a personal device.\n\nRepublicans, however, see it differently. They accused Democrats of running an \u201cunfair process,\u201d saying Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine who testified last week, was treated poorly.\n\n\u201cThat treatment is the reason why the administration and the State Department said we are not going to subject Ambassador Sondland to the same treatment,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican.\n\nIn a pair of tweets, Mr. Trump said he would \u201clove\u201d to have Mr. Sondland testify, but doesn\u2019t trust Democrats to give him a fair shake.\n\n\u201cWould love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and a great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for public to see,\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nMr. Trump also chided the media, saying they failed to report on a Tweet sent earlier this week from Mr. Sondland. In the tweet, Mr. Sondland said Democrats were \u201cincorrect\u201d about the president\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear: no quid pro qous of any kind,\u201d Mr. Sondland tweeted.\n\nRobert Luskin, the attorney representing Mr. Sondland, said in a statement that as a State Department employee, his client had to comply with the administration\u2019s directive.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today,\u201d Mr. Luskin said. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States and he stands ready to answer the committee\u2019s questions fully and truthfully.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump directed the ambassador to take the lead in building the relationship between Ukraine and the United States. In that capacity, Mr. Sondland reported directly to the president.\n\nText messages turned over to Congress last week revealed that Mr. Sondland and another official wrote a statement they wanted Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky to release that would have committed to an investigation of Mr. Biden and the Ukrainian business dealings of his son, Hunter.\n\nBoth diplomats discussed the statement with Rudolph W. Giluliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
