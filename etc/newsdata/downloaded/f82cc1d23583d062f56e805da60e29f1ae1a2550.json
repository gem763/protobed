Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threw her support behind Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., last week.\n\nIn some ways it was a team player move, even an establishment move.\n\nMarkey is a 73-year-old incumbent, and AOC\u2019s announcement was part of an effort by Markey to roll out as many endorsements as possible, to demonstrate that the party is with him and not with his 38-year-old challenger, Rep. Joe Kennedy III.\n\nFurthermore, Markey\u2019s pressure campaign leaned most heavily on the argument that a run by Kennedy \u2014 who plans to announce his candidacy this coming Saturday \u2014 would be harmful to the party.\n\nHowever, Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t throw in with Markey to minimize intraparty friction. She endorsed Markey for ideological reasons. He was her chief partner in the Senate\u2019s push for her climate change legislation, the Green New Deal, and Kennedy was not an immediate supporter of that initiative. AOC called Markey a \u201cproud and strong progressive champion.\u201d\n\nStephen O\u2019Hanlon, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, a climate change activist group, argued that it \u201cmakes sense that he is one of the first people Rep. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed.\u201d\n\n\u201cEd Markey has been a powerful champion for progressive ideas for decades and has been one of the foremost leaders fighting for the Green New Deal,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon told Yahoo News.\n\nNonetheless, Ocasio-Cortez came to power by defeating an incumbent Democrat and has been aligned with progressives who believe challenging Democratic officeholders in primary elections is central to reforming the party.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez issued another endorsement, this time of a challenger to an incumbent congressman: activist Marie Newman, who is running against eight-term Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill. A spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment about internal deliberations over the sequencing of her endorsements.\n\nBut backing a primary challenger over an incumbent was more \u201con brand\u201d \u2014 as one Democratic activist put it \u2014 for AOC.\n\nHer endorsement of Newman was also ideological. Lipinski is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. But it wasn\u2019t that provocative a move either. Newman has also been endorsed already by other Democrats. In 2018, when she ran against Lipinski and narrowly lost, she was backed by two Illinois Democrats: Rep. Jan Schakowsky and then-Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez. This year, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have both endorsed Newman.\n\nMarie Newman and Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill.

The 29-year-old celebrity lawmaker made it to Washington by defeating a powerful incumbent, 11-term Rep. Joe Crowley. Yet now her endorsements could be seen as part of her evolution from upstart anti-establishment firebrand to D.C. legislator, a shift she appeared to acknowledge in an interview published on Wednesday in the New York Times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about being an activist,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the Times. \u201cIt forces you to grow. So it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t endorse activists, but it also requires an assessment for a capacity of growth and how you navigate a space like this.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez entered Congress closely aligned with the Justice Democrats, a group that made challenging incumbent lawmakers part of its core purpose.\n\n\u201cWe at Justice Democrats have a chance to really transform the Democratic Party. Running in competitive primary elections in Democratic-held seats is important,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a videotaped conversation with Ocasio-Cortez, released at the beginning of this year.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep doing Democrat vs. Democrat primaries ... because it\u2019s a way to move the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction and make Democrats more accountable to their base and not just corporate donors,\u201d Justice Democrats spokesman Waleed Shahid said at that time.", "description": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appears to be playing more of an insider game in some of her recent endorsements.
