Twenty-five SAA planes, 12 Comair and seven Mango Airlines planes were taken out of service, but have since then returned to operations.\n\nSEE MORE: Ops back to normal says OR Tambo after grounding of Comair and SAA planes\n\nThe five issues unpacked\n\nOne was related to an issue where aircraft were released from maintenance by off by unqualified staff at SAAT, while the other was related to maintenance on black boxes and their voice recorders that weren't done in line with international regulations.\n\nThe other three were more administrative in nature, related to a lack of information released on aircraft and the failure to implement previous findings which were easy to rectify.\n\nSACAA sought assurance that the issue wasn't replicated on other aircraft and required evidence from the airlines affected. While the evidence was being investigated, the airlines opted to ground the planes affected by the findings as a safety measure.\n\nTransport minister Fikile Mbalula continued to maintain that it was not a crisis, and that it happens more often than people think.\n\n\"SAAT is itself an internationally rated business, but our role as the Department of Transport is to regulate and monitor,\" says Mbalula.\n\n\"SAAT services many airlines including those that compete with SAA and other international airlines that come to South Africa, its track record is blemish-free in this aspect and our work is to assist but verify that they continue to make South Africa proud. When SAA made the pronouncements it did about certain concerns on parts used by SAAT, as regulator, SACCA was duty-bound to act.\"\n\n\"It is against this backdrop that the SACAA engaged with the affected airlines to solicit assurance that the rest of the fleet does not display the same deficiencies.\"\n\nREAD: 'Woke up at 4am, just to get slapped with a 5-hour flight delay' - Twitter reacts to devastating flight delays\n\nCommitment to safety\n\nKhoza reiterated this, adding that they are \"not being dramatic\" when they find issues at airports and with airlines, adding that this incident only became such a big issue because it happened on a much bigger scale than usual and created a lot more inconvenience.\n\n\"We are in the business of safety and security, and that involves passengers' lives and cannot be taken likely. The CAA doesn\u2019t have any friends that they negotiate with, we don\u2019t discuss if there\u2019s an imminent danger \u2013 we act. We are firm, we are fair and we act without fear or favour.\"\n\nFundi Sithebe, COO at Airports Company South Africa reiterated the commitment to safety, stating that they had minimised disruptions effectively through pro-active management.\n\nA key reason that led to the panic around the grounding was a lack of communication, according to the minister, which the department will ensure is more effective and clear in the future.\n\nMbalula also highlighted South Africa's safety record of zero fatal accidents concerning airlines and other scheduled commercial operations.\n\n\"The number of aircraft accidents can be used as one of the basic barometers that can indicate the presence or otherwise of the effective administration of civil aviation safety and security oversight in a country.\"", "description": "A press conference was held at OR Tambo International Airport with the Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, SACAA and Acsa to give an update on the state of aviation in South Africa on Thursday.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago - Gabi Zietsman"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4248/e5c11bf10e2b4d90a907400730655e9d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
