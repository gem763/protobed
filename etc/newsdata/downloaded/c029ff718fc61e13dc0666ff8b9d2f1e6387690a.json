It\u2019s not as though there aren\u2019t any problems with Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, Turner declares, much of which is \u201cnot okay\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The problem, Turner continues, is that \u201cnot okay\u201d doesn\u2019t rise to the level of impeachment, and the complainant doesn\u2019t appear to have much more, especially any direct knowledge of the events he alleges. That\u2019s why, Turner alleges, chair Adam Schiff and other Democrats are stuck with \u201cmaking things up\u201d:\n\nWhile critical of hearing and whistleblower's complaint, GOP Rep. Mike Turner says Pres. Trump's conversation with Ukraine \"is not okay.\" \"That conversation is not okay, and I think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the transcript.\" https://t.co/fUBRdsHDCG pic.twitter.com/Rzbgyh6mbb \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 26, 2019\n\nTURNER: Now, I\u2019ve read the complaint and I\u2019ve read the transcript of the conversation with the president and the president of the Ukraine. Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the president, this is not okay. That conversation is not okay, and I think it\u2019s disappointing to the American public when they read the transcript. I can say what else it is not: it is not what\u2019s in the complaint. We now have the complaint and the transcript, and people can read that the allegations in the complaint are not the allegations of the subject matter of this conversation. What else it\u2019s not: it\u2019s not the conversation that was in the chairman\u2019s opening statement. While the chairman was speaking, I actually had someone text me, \u201cIs he just making this up?\u201d And yes, yes, he was, because sometimes fiction is better than the actual words in the text.\n\nWhat did Schiff make up? Here\u2019s the portion of his opening statement in which Schiff seems to be referencing the reporting on the conversation prior to the release of the transcript, rather than the transcript itself:\n\nRep. Schiff re-writes the call transcript for added drama: \"I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good, I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it, on this and on that, I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people\" pic.twitter.com/1rV7BpEN6o \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 26, 2019\n\nSchiff tried to claim that he was offering \u201cthe essence\u201d of what was being said, but to call that a stretch is quite an understatement. That turned some heads, and not just Turners\u2019:\n\nAdam Schiff just made up what President Trump said during his call with Ukrainian President Zelensky \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 26, 2019\n\nAdam Schiff is now doing a fictional retelling of the transcript. This is bizarre. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 26, 2019\n\nTurner continued to rebuke Schiff for hijacking an important oversight committee with a specific purpose all year to pursue impeachment. That project is \u201can assault on the electorate,\u201d Turner declared, part of Democrats two-year-plus project to negate the results of a legitimate election:\n\nTURNER: Luckily, the American public are smart, and they have the transcript. They\u2019ve read the conversation. They know when someone\u2019s just making it up. Now, we\u2019ve seen this movie before; we\u2019ve been here all year on litigating impeachment long before the July 25th conversation happened between the president and the president of the Ukraine. And we\u2019ve heard the clicks of the camera in this Intelligence Committee\u2019s room, where we\u2019ve not been focusing on the issues of national security threats but instead of the calls for impeachment, which is really an assault on the electorate, not just this president.\n\nWhat was Schiff\u2019s response to this? Clown nose on, dudes!\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff (CA) admits that his blatant fabrication of quotes from Trump's Ukraine call was \"wrong\" after he got called out Schiff claims it was a \"parody\" Impeachment is a politically polarizing event and Schiff thinks it's just a big joke Absolutely unreal pic.twitter.com/YqcQscCKYt \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 26, 2019\n\nWell, it\u2019s good to know that Schiff considers himself a comedian now. The rest of us reached that conclusion months ago.\n\nOtherwise, the House Intelligence Committee hearing featuring Joseph Maguire\u2019s testimony is turning out to be something of a snoozer. Analysts have complained on Twitter that the panel members seem much more interested in process than in the central claim of the whistleblower \u2014 that Donald Trump abused his office for personal political gain. That, of course, could be because the provenance of that claim involves second- and third-hand information from a complaint based in large part (but not entirely) on a phone call whose transcript has already been published.\n\nBesides, Maguire was called to testify about the process more than the specifics of the complaint. Schiff hauled him before the committee to answer for his initial refusal to produce the complaint and the whistleblower to the committee, which Maguire explained involved potential questions of executive privilege and intel community jurisdiction. The White House never did make a privilege claim, Maguire has testified, which allowed him to finally produce the complaint and make the whistleblower available \u2014 although Maguire also acknowledged that the situation was unprecedented, in his experience.\n\nIt may not be the sexiest conversation in the world, but it\u2019s a necessary one, especially \u2014 as Maguire points out \u2014 we don\u2019t really have anything in this complaint except unsubstantiated gossip. As for a cover-up, Maguire sums up the situation well when answering Eric Swalwell:\n\nActing DNI Maguire: \"How the White House, the executive office of the president and the national security council conduct their business is their business.\" Rep. Swalwell: \"Well, it's actually your business to protect America's secrets, is that right?\" \"It's all of ours.\" pic.twitter.com/9GN3OkTVMm \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 26, 2019\n\nMAGUIRE: Congressman, there is an allegation of a cover-up. I\u2019m sure an investigation and before this committee might lend credence or disprove that. But right now, all we have is an allegation with second-hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge of whether or not that is true and accurate.\n\nPerhaps everyone should stop leaping to conclusions, and maybe avoid making things up as a springboard for that purpose too.", "description": "\" ... really an assault on the electorate, not just this president.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/turner.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
