(AP) - Jadeveon Clowney spent Monday exactly where he wanted to end up.\n\nHe was no longer in Houston. He was in Seattle, the place former teammate Duane Brown helped convince him would be the best landing spot for the pass rusher.\n\nClowney had successfully taken back control of his career, and combined with some deft maneuvering by the Seahawks, found a new place to call home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over, the whole process of being traded and everything,\u201d Clowney said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I can be a part of this team here now and get going on a new journey.\u201d\n\nClowney went through his first practice in Seattle on Monday, two days after the agreement was reached for his trade from the Texans. Clowney held out of training camp in Houston unhappy with his contract situation after the Texans used the franchise tag on him for the upcoming season.\n\nEventually his patience in staying away from the Texans paid off. He was sent to Seattle in exchange for a 2020 third-round pick, two players, and an agreement with the Seahawks they would not use the franchise tag on him after next season.\n\nIt may just turn out to be a one-year rental for the Seahawks, but still could be a win for all parties. Seattle landed the elite pass rusher it needed to help answer the biggest question for a team that should be a contender in the NFC. Clowney got the freedom to become a free agent after next season and decide if Seattle is where he wants to stay or see what else is available on the open market.\n\n\u201cHis excitement about coming here and being part of this team and ready to take advantage of this opportunity to show where he belongs. He\u2019s not going to let this go by now,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cHe wants to show us that we\u2019ve got to have him here. That\u2019s thrilling for us to hear. We\u2019ll see what goes down in the long haul.\u201d\n\nDespite missing all of training camp and preseason, Clowney said he expects to play in Sunday\u2019s season opener against Cincinnati. His first practice with Seattle was simply learning the basics of the defensive scheme, but Clowney believes his offseason conditioning and the work he did during his holdout should allow him to play in Week 1.\n\nThe Seahawks could end up with both of their new defensive ends being available. Ziggy Ansah returned to practice last week and is on track to be ready to go against the Bengals.\n\n\u201cThose guys are like bookends. They\u2019re exactly what you\u2019re looking for on the edge,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll be able to see these guys come together and be a factor and play off one another and complement each other.\u201d\n\nAnother important factor in Clowney landing in Seattle was Brown. The veteran offensive tackle\u2019s voice is respected inside the Seahawks facility, and it was his conversations with Carroll and other staff members that alleviated any concerns Seattle may have had about bringing Clowney to Seattle.\n\nIt also worked in the other direction, with Clowney asking Brown what Seattle was like.\n\n\u201cWithout question Duane helped us through the process helping us know who we\u2019re dealing with, the player he used to practice against, and capabilities, potential, habits, background, family. I mean we really had a lot of insights because of Duane,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nFrom a scheme standpoint, Clowney sounded thrilled to be no longer playing in a 3-4 defensive alignment. In Seattle\u2019s 4-3, he\u2019ll rarely - if ever - be asked to drop into coverage. Or as Clowney described, \u201cwhen you\u2019re going forward, you don\u2019t think about a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best thing about this defense is you\u2019ve got guys behind you that can make all the plays,\u201d Clowney said. \u201cSo the guys up front just get moving and get going and cause havoc. That\u2019s what I like about this.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Seattle continued to reshuffling its roster by re-signing WR Jaron Brown and FB Nick Bellore on Monday. The Seahawks placed TE Ed Dickson on injured reserve with a knee injury and released backup LB Austin Calitro. The move with Calitro was a surprise after he started five games last season and played multiple positions. But it was a spot where Seattle had a glut of players after keeping seven LBs on its initial 53-man roster, including rookies Cody Barton and Ben Burr-Kirven, and Shaquem Griffin. \u2026 Seattle finished off its 10-player practice squad by signing LB Jachai Polite, G Kyle Fuller, CB Ryan Neal and G Kahlil McKenzie. Polite was a third-round pick of the New York Jets, but was cut over the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jadeveon Clowney spent Monday exactly where he wanted to end up.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": ""}
