Klimkin, who was Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister in August when he learned of the Trump administration\u2019s suspension of military aid by reading a news article.\n\nThe blocking of military aid to Ukraine is now at the center of questions about whether President Donald Trump manipulated foreign policy to pressure the Ukrainian government to take action that would hurt Joe Biden, the former vice president and a top rival in the campaign for the presidency.\n\nTrump acknowledged Sunday that he used a July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to accuse Biden of corruption.\n\nBiden oversaw U.S. policy toward Ukraine in the Obama administration when his son served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. Allies of Trump have pointed to a conflict of interest, and asked Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s request in 2016 that Ukraine\u2019s president at the time, Petro O. Poroshenko, dismiss a prosecutor who had investigated the gas company.\n\nBy the time of that July 25 call, the administration had already suspended the aid, a decision reached in early July, according to a former U.S. official.\n\nBut the news would not reach the Ukranian officials until much later, and then through nonofficial channels. For years, Ukranian officials had coordinated with the Pentagon, the State Department and members of Congress on military aid.\n\nKlimkin said he received no formal notice through U.S. diplomatic channels of the halt in aid, although he noted the suspension came as the ministry was transitioning to a new administration. He left the ministry on Aug. 29.\n\nU.S. military assistance for Ukraine had flowed unobstructed into the country since 2014, the year Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a war in two eastern provinces. The aid had always arrived in carefully choreographed shipments planned months in advance.\n\nIf the United States harbored concerns about any misuse of the aid by Ukraine, the senior officials said they had never heard about them.\n\nKlimkin said U.S. officials had always provided the aid along with encouragement to overhaul the army and military industries to root out corruption.\n\nBut Klimkin said that aid was not conditional on those issues, and that he had heard no expressions of concern on those fronts from the United States in 2019.\n\n\u201cI never heard a discussion about meeting these conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any indication that something could have gone wrong.\u201d\n\nAfter a bipartisan outcry in Congress, the White House agreed to restore the aid in mid-September.\n\nIf the decision to suspend the aid was tied to a request by Trump for a politically motivated investigation, that \u201crepresents a fundamental challenge and problem for Ukraine,\u201d Klimkin said, possibly threatening what had been bipartisan support in Congress for military assistance to the country.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the only ones who will be happy about that are the people sitting in the Kremlin,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview on Ukrainian television on Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s current foreign minister, Vadym V. Prystaiko, said Trump had not pressured Zelenskiy in the telephone call.\n\n\u201cThere was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist,\u201d he said. \u201cThis conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, including those requiring serious answers.\u201d\n\nAnother official who learned of the hold on aid like a bolt from the blue was Oleh Shevchuk, who was deputy minister of defense in charge of logistics and oversaw the aid shipments until this month. He also said he learned of it through media reports.\n\nEverything had been arriving smoothly, he said. Even as the news of the suspension came out, he said, Ukraine was receiving containers of medical supplies in Odessa, a Black Sea port. The Ukrainian military was expecting 33 Humvees equipped as ambulances, water purifying equipment and so-called containerized housing units, or mobile homes for soldiers. The Ukrainian military still expects these items, he said.\n\nIn fact, the hold came and went so quickly he noticed no change in the shipments and U.S. officials never informed him of any planned delays, Shevchuk said. \u201cWe got more this year than last year,\u201d he said.", "description": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Senior Ukrainian officials said they were blindsided over the summer when they heard the United States would withhold security assistance to the country.\"It was a total surprise,\" said Pavlo A.
