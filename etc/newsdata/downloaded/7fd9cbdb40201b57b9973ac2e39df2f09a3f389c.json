It will change you, it will outlive you\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Contemporary art is the actor\u2019s passion. As he curates a festival in Margate to celebrate the Turner prize, he discusses his collection, his podcast - and advising James Corden on what to buy\n\nCor, Russell Tovey\u2019s apartment is gorgeous! A New York-style warehouse-style place, with wooden floors, big windows at front and back, two light-filled bedrooms and enough space in the living-dining-hanging-out area for an army of cool cats to swing. But it\u2019s not the flat itself that dazzles, fabulous though it is. It\u2019s the art.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you notice it. On every wall there are canvases \u2013 huge, brightly coloured abstracts, delicate etchings, cartoon-like figures in spray paint and oils. Sculptures nestle in alcoves or stand proud on tables. One piece \u2013 a chair in the guest bedroom by Jessi Reaves \u2013 is only recognisable as art because it\u2019s so tatty when compared to the rest of the furnishings. (\u201cMost of my friends hate that one,\u201d Tovey laughs. \u201cThey think it looks like it was found in a skip.\u201d) How much art does he own? He counts up in his head: \u201cAbout 250 pieces,\u201d he says. A lot of it is in storage.\n\nWell known as an actor \u2013 one of the original History Boys, Being Human and most recently, the amazing Years and Years \u2013 Tovey has another, less-documented life. He is an absolute, stone-cold art buff: a self-taught specialist, a taste-making collector, an art \u201cgeek\u201d. Geek is the word he usually uses about himself when on Talk Art, the podcast he hosts with gallery director Robert Diament; though he could equally call himself an enthusiast. He adores contemporary art, and his passion, over the years, has led him to expertise. He hosts special in-house tours in his apartment for high-up people such as patrons of the Royal Academy and is a guest curator for Margate NOW, an art festival created to celebrate this year\u2019s Turner prize being held in the town.\n\nFrom 28 September until 13 October Margate is being taken over by art: as well as the Turner prize, there will be performances and screenings, pieces placed in unexpected places, work that only lasts a few days, and other works that have been months in the making. Five hundred artists and performers making more than 60 events in total, most involving Margate citizens. Yuri Suzuki, a local artist, has created 12 horns representing 12 sections of Kent that will broadcast songs and tales sung and told by locals. Open School East has been busy working with Margate kids, as has 1927, a theatre company. Tovey \u2013 who recently bought a flat in Margate \u2013 is excited. \u201cCulture automatically raises the status of a place and raises its quality,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd culture is something that brings people together. That\u2019s the whole point, because it\u2019s about humans communicating with other humans about what it is to be alive.\u201d\n\nI am interested in all this of course but I am far more intrigued by Tovey\u2019s flat. Can we look around? Tovey gives me an info-packed tour. It\u2019s noticeable that he mostly chooses to highlight the female artists in his collection. The first piece he ever bought, with his cheque from the film version of The History Boys, was a Tracey Emin etching, and he has always made a point of buying women\u2019s art: Phyllida Barlow, Rebecca Warren, Rose Wylie, who he worships. He has a lot by older artists, including the 90-year-old Venezuelan Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, who works in Venice, California; Carmen Herrera, who is 104; Etel Adnan, from Beirut, in her 90s. He likes supporting female artists because he feels they have a tougher time than their male counterparts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Orlando by Toyin Ojih Odutola Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York\n\nWe spend some time admiring a gorgeous work by African American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola, who, says Tovey, \u201ccreates this fantasy of these fantastical Nigerian families in images that you would normally see in white depictions of royal families. And these families have been joined by their gay sons. So it\u2019s really imagining something that probably is never possible in Nigeria, but every one of these characters has their own story and their own place within these families.\u201d\n\nHe has a couple of Joyce Pensatos on display. A few months ago, he and Diament interviewed Pensato, maker of scary-drip versions of classic cartoon figures and comic book heroes. She died of pancreatic cancer in June, aged 77. Tovey had collected her art for a while, and they\u2019d become friends: she requested that her last interview be for Tovey\u2019s podcast.\n\nIn just over a year, they\u2019ve made 30-plus Talk Art programmes including lively interviews with artists \u2013 Ryan Gander and Rose Wylie \u2013 or art-friendly people (often actors) such as Zawe Ashton and Lena Dunham, and art world heavyweights \u2013 the Serpentine\u2019s Hans Ulrich Obrist, gallery owner Sadie Coles and the director of Turner Contemporary, Victoria Pomery. The podcasts are gossipy and fun, engaging and well researched. The point, says Tovey, is to make a podcast about serious art that is approachable, that anyone can listen to.\n\nTour done, we settle down for a chat at Tovey\u2019s big kitchen table. As we talk, I am struck by how different he is to most actors I\u2019ve met. Not only because of his passion for art, but because of his steady self-confidence. Most actors are insecure (understandable, given their profession), and deliberately sparkle for interviewers. Tovey is charming, friendly company, but he\u2019s also robust. Not desperate to make me like him (though I do). The main feeling I get from him is determination.\n\nI tell him he seems like the kind of person that has an idea and then absolutely commits to following it through. \u201cI am,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mum says that I\u2019m blinkered, and if I want something I get it. I think it comes from enthusiasm and I\u2019ve never apologised for being enthusiastic. When I want to know about something \u2013 ie art \u2013 I want to know everything. I have to know everything about it.\u201d\n\nThe Sensation exhibition blew my mind. It felt like something had shifted. It was my Woodstock moment\n\nWhen he was a kid, growing up in Billericay and Romford, Essex, Tovey used to collect stuff. Rocks, minerals, fossils, coins, stamps, phone cards. One day he realised he had to streamline his life, so he got rid: sold his coins to one of the coin shops opposite the British Museum, put the phone cards on eBay. He was good at art himself \u2013 he still draws, mostly cute cartoons of himself for his boyfriend, Steve Brockman, or of their three dogs \u2013 and he was \u201cvisually stimulated\u201d as a child, buying comics featuring Ren and Stimpy, Beavis and Butthead, Rocko\u2019s Modern Life, and watching Rugrats. It wasn\u2019t such a big leap from those to Roy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Mel Ramos, Patrick Caulfield. But the big \u201caha\u201d moment was when he went to see the YBA Sensation show, in 1997, when he\u2019d just turned 16 (he\u2019s nearly 38 now). \u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like something had shifted. People say, ooh, the swinging 60s, and I\u2019m always like: \u2018OK, cool\u2019\u2026 Sensation was my Woodstock moment.\u201d\n\nHe went back home in a daze, and, when required by his sixth form college, Barking College, to make a speech as part of an assignment, he did one about the importance of contemporary art. He got a pig\u2019s ear from a pet shop and put it in a tank of water to explain Damien Hirst (he called it Sow Memory). He found a bit of glass and passed it round his class, asking everyone what it made them think of. \u201cThat was my Duchamp, my ready-made.\u201d He got a distinction. \u201cBut that was the only award I got. They chucked me out after a year.\u201d\n\nThey chucked him out because he didn\u2019t take up a role in the college play; having been working as an actor since he was 11, he\u2019d landed some paid work and did that instead. Soon after, he started at the National Theatre, and got a life-changing part in Alan Bennett\u2019s The History Boys. He made friends with Emin when the play was up for a South Bank award. At the party afterwards, they got on so well that she subsequently asked him to be her plus one at various dos. \u201cIt was during her miaowing phase,\u201d he recalls. Now Emin has moved into her imperial era, they remain excellent friends.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tovey with T\u2019Nia Miller in Years and Years. Photograph: BBC/Red Productions/Guy Farrow\n\nIn fact, she gave him a discount on that first ever art purchase; he got together the money but was then shocked that he had to find 17.5% more (the VAT rate back then). Now, he\u2019s savvy enough to buy much of his art in the US, so he only pays 5% import tax, as opposed to 20% VAT. He started buying work over there when he was cast in a big HBO series, Looking, in 2013, and in later US-based series such as Quantico.\n\nHow does he find the art he likes? Initially, he says, he used art advisers; but not for long. Advisers are usually there to find the work that will make the buyer the most money, and that\u2019s not why Tovey is buying art. He wants to support emerging artists, to look after work he considers important. He has ideals. \u201cContemporary art, especially, is all about the moment. The artist is trying to tell their story. So I feel like if you buy art, you\u2019re part of the dialogue about history, and you\u2019re contributing a little bit, by looking after it, to all these stories that are going to live for ever. Art is for everyone and outlives you.\u201d\n\nSo now he finds the art himself. If he sees something he likes in a gallery, he will email: \u201cI always say, I\u2019m a London-based actor and collector, because some artists like being collected by an actor.\u201d He occasionally buys in auctions: \u201cI love it. But if you don\u2019t win, you do feel like you\u2019re being told off by the gavel.\u201d And he uses social media.\n\n\u201cThe magic of Instagram,\u201d he says. \u201cWith emerging artists, if you post a picture of their work or you comment on it, if you \u2018at\u2019 them, they normally contact you. Or you can direct message them and be like: \u2018Hey!\u2019 I\u2019ve done this so many times where I\u2019ve been in the States. I say: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 And they\u2019re like: \u2018In Brooklyn\u2019, and I say: \u2018Can I come do a studio visit?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A visitor poses with artist Joyce Pensato\u2019s Mickey for Micky at the 2014 Frieze Fair in London. Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters\n\nHe understands and cultivates his own taste: \u201cI oscillate between figurative, cartoony abstraction and geometric abstractions.\u201d (Is there anything he doesn\u2019t like? He thinks: \u201cGerhard Richter\u2019s squidgy paintings. I just fucking hate them. They make me really angry. I think they\u2019re shit.\u201d)\n\nThese days, friends ask him to be their art advisers. James Corden, another of the first History Boys, has been in touch, asking for advice: \u201cJames messaged me the other day, and I\u2019ve got him buying work. He\u2019s got loads of money now, so he\u2019s like: \u2018What should I do?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Buy art!\u2019 So he\u2019s running stuff by me and I\u2019m like: \u2018No, don\u2019t do that, how about this?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Tovey\u2019s researching art, disappearing into internet wormholes. It\u2019s how he relaxes. He re-educates himself constantly. He used to have a problem with video and sound-based work, partly because he looked at art as a collector. But now he\u2019s into it. \u201cMy medium of choice has always been painting, works on paper and sculpture. I saw video and sound art as not so important. But now I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d Because it\u2019s all about connecting and experience. And being immersive. And what\u2019s more immersive than that?\u201d\n\nCan he understand that some people find art difficult? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you just have not to be intimidated by it. Go to a museum, you\u2019re going to see a thousand works of art. And if you find one you like and spend time in front of it, on some low level, molecularly, it will change you. That moment of culture.\u201d\n\nHe gets cross about bad art, as he does about all bad culture. He has a little rant about rubbish plays: \u201cImagine someone going to see a play for the first time, and they\u2019ve saved up their money, and they get dressed up, and they get a train to London. And they have lunch before, all excited\u2026 and it\u2019s crap. And afterwards, they don\u2019t want to badmouth the play, they just assume that because they saw it on stage, it\u2019s got to be good. But fundamentally, inside them, they know it\u2019s not. That makes me sad.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tovey with Jamie Parker in The History Boys at the National Theatre in 2004. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nThis leads us, naturally, to his acting career. Tovey has a film to promote. The Good Liar, out on 8 November, stars Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren and is \u201ca con-rom romcom\u201d. Tovey plays Mirren\u2019s son and he loved doing the film, adored Mirren (he calls her Dame Heaven Mirren) and the director Bill Condon. He\u2019s quite proud because it\u2019s a big film, \u201cmy first proper one\u201d. I think of him as thoroughly established, but he still feels he\u2019s known more for his TV and theatre work than the \u201cculty\u201d films he\u2019s been in, such as The History Boys and The Pass. This seems, to him, to be a move into a bigger film world.\n\nHe works hard, and he moves easily between all his worlds: podcast host, theatre/TV/film actor, presenter, art collector and curator. He\u2019s even written a TV comedy drama. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to diversify now, you don\u2019t have to stay in your lane. Like [singer] Jessie Ware, her podcast [Table Manners] has completely changed her life.\u201d In all areas, he\u2019s acquired devoted fans, some sweet (he tells me that he cried this morning over some fan art of his character in Years and Years, Daniel, and his boyfriend Victor), some rude (he gets sent dick pics via social media).\n\nAnd what of the future? Long term, he has two art-style ambitions. He wants to get to a financial point where he can buy a little flat and support an emerging artist to come to London for three months and live rent-free. And he wants to have a foundation, a Tovey Foundation, which shows his collection in rotation. This would be in Margate or London, \u201canywhere, really. It could be in Essex, maybe Billericay, make it a destination.\u201d \u201cThis art,\u201d he says, \u201cI own it but it isn\u2019t mine. I feel like it\u2019s everybody\u2019s. I love sharing it. I do walks and talks around my flat like it\u2019s a museum, and I love showing off to my friends\u2026 but that\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s for everyone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nWhy the arts can lead the revival of Britain\u2019s towns | Nicholas Serota Read more\n\nMore short term, in previous interviews, he\u2019s talked about wanting to have a baby before he\u2019s 40. Next year, he\u2019s going to be in New York for the whole year, rehearsing and performing in Joe Mantello\u2019s production of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, alongside Eddie Izzard, and he plans to use that time to set some baby wheels in motion. \u201cI\u2019ll really be putting the feelers out on how we\u2019re going to make this work,\u201d he says. I\u2019m so sure that he will make it happen that I offer congratulations. \u201cThanks,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not happened yet!\u201d\n\nWhere does his confidence come from? His parents, he says, always told him he could do anything, and he\u2019s worked hard to take advantage of his opportunities. He\u2019s had therapy when he has felt he needed to and he has followed his passions. He tells his young relatives to work out what they want to do, and pursue that with energy. He told his nephew the other day that if he wanted to go to art school, he would pay for it, \u201cand I shook his hand\u201d.\n\nI feel like cheering. What a positive force Russell Tovey is.\n\n\u201cThe thing is though, I\u2019m getting the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like when people say to me: \u2018God, you work hard.\u2019 If you\u2019re getting the opportunity to do or have something you love, then you\u2019re going to work hard, aren\u2019t you, because work is more fun than fun. Because there\u2019s people who don\u2019t know what they want to do, or they build walls to stop themselves doing what they want to do. And that\u2019s awful. Isn\u2019t it the best gift to know what you want to do with your life?\u201d\n\nMargate NOW runs from 28 Sep\u201313 Oct.
