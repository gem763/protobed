JTG has grown from a small team in a barn to a two-car team with more than 100 employees, and I\u2019m looking forward to joining the family. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity, and ready to go win races with the ultimate goal of making the Playoffs and competing for a championship.\u201d\n\nStenhouse joins JTG Daugherty Racing after a decade of racing with Roush Fenway. He earned two Xfinity Series titles for the team before moving up to the Cup Series full-time in 2013.\n\nIn 251 Cup starts, Stenhouse has two wins. Those came at Daytona and Talladega. He failed to make the playoffs the last two seasons.\n\nTad Geschickter shared some insight into why he went with Stenhouse on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio\u2019s \u201cSiriusXM Speedway\u201d Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe looked at the whole field of people that were available and accomplished enough to run at the Cup level,\u201d Geschickter said. \u201cReally narrowed it down to two. At the end it\u2019s Ricky\u2019s resume and experience and to see it alongside Ryan, whose still learning his craft at the Cup level, we just thought it made sense to have that veteran experience that\u2019s won races be part of the program as Ryan continues to develop into that winning presence.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Stenhouse led 32 laps in the race at Talladega, his most laps led this season.\n\n\u201c(The deal was) definitely pretty much done at that point, but it sure made me feel good about the decision if there were any worries,\u201d Geschickter said. \u201cRicky\u2019s just fast everywhere. He\u2019s a tremendous talent. I think we\u2019re blessed to get him. We\u2019re going to miss Chris. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll miss a step here.\u201d\n\nGeschickter was asked by SiriusXM if Stenhouse\u2019s reputation for being involved in wrecks as a result of aggressive racing was discussed during the negotiation process.\n\n\u201cI did not know him well until I met him a couple of weeks ago and talked a lot obviously over the last couple of weeks,\u201d Geschickter said. \u201cHe\u2019s breath of fresh air. You can talk pretty frankly with him, he talks frankly back to you. We certainly had that discussion. But as we discussed it, I\u2019d rather go to the bit than go to the whip. He wants it badly. We\u2019re kind of excited to have that dynamic in here. Ryan\u2019s the same way, by the way. he want\u2019s it badly.\u201d\n\nICYMI: @JTGRacing Co-owner Tad Geschickter explained to @DGodfatherMoody why his team chose @StenhouseJr to fill the hole left by Chris Buescher in 2020. #NASCAR #SXMSpeedway pic.twitter.com/KXRK4Q4DqF \u2014 SiriusXM NASCAR Radio (Ch. 90) (@SiriusXMNASCAR) October 16, 2019\n\n\n\n", "description": "Ricky Stenhouse Jr. will take the place of Chris Buescher, who will replace him at Roush Fenway Racing.", "authors": ["Daniel Mcfadin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1eQV9j0lyGOiUI7WOKXQDg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMDg0MTY4MzM2NjczMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_cIet0omdZQpLYtICdhQ6A--~B/aD01NjM7dz05OTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d5578936addf79d33975806c0983f2d7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
