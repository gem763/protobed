The AG has no role in President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Barr did not ask the president to intercede with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for the purpose of seeking assistance with the ongoing Durham probe of the Russia investigation. Despite the president\u2019s reference to Barr in the July 25 Zelensky phone call, Barr did not communicate with Trump about Ukraine before the call. Barr did not follow up with the Ukrainians, nor did he discuss Ukraine with the president or the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing mentioned on a phone call is not a basis for recusal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, it is commonplace for the Justice Department to seek assistance from foreign governments in gathering evidence or providing access to witnesses, in both the investigative and the trial phases of criminal cases. With respect to Ukraine specifically, the United States has had a treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters for nearly 20 years. President Clinton directed that the treaty be signed in 1998 and ratified it in early 2001 with Senate consent.\n\nThat is, if Attorney General Barr had explicitly asked President Trump to seek Ukraine\u2019s assistance, that would have been completely appropriate and routine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn point of fact, the AG made no such request. Had he done so, though, he would have been properly functioning as attorney general in a Justice Department investigation. There would not be a scintilla of basis for recusal even if Barr had had the \u201crole\u201d that Feinstein wrongly claims he had.\n\nThird, we come to Feinstein\u2019s claim about Barr\u2019s role in the president\u2019s purported effort to \u201cundermine the Russia investigation.\u201d This brings us back to what I warned about three weeks ago. The Democrats have been laying the groundwork for the argument that they pounded away at this weekend: The Barr/Durham investigation is not a legitimate Justice Department investigation; it is a political initiative of the Trump 2020 campaign. It\u2019s not true, but that\u2019s their story and they\u2019re sticking to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou have to admire the Democrats\u2019 chutzpah. Consider: They know full well that the GOP-controlled Senate is not going to remove the president from power if the Democratic-controlled House impeaches him. And they are still so worried about being punished by voters for overplaying their hand that they won\u2019t take an accountable vote to have the House as an institution \u2014 the institution constitutionally vested with impeachment power \u2014 conduct the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d that the Democrats are pursuing. Their impeachment gambit, with its secret hearings and strategic leaks, is blatantly political. Yet even as they engage in precisely the political abuse of impeachment power that the Framers feared, they loudly claim it is the Justice Department that is abusively politicizing its powers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best defense is a good offense, but they shouldn\u2019t get away with it.\n\nWe do not know to what extent, if any, Ukraine factors into the Barr/Durham investigation. As I recount in Ball of Collusion, there is public reporting that the Obama administration used its considerable influence over Ukraine \u2014 which included financial aid that Kyiv desperately needed \u2014 to affect Ukraine\u2019s law-enforcement investigations. This reportedly included pushing Ukrainian investigators and prosecutors to investigate Paul Manafort, who was affiliated with the Trump campaign for several months (four of them as its chairman). It is sheer speculation, however, that this alleged episode forms any part of the Justice Department\u2019s look at the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nEven if we assume that it does, though, Ukraine still provides no basis for the attorney general to recuse himself. This is not a Jeff Sessions situation. Barr\u2019s predecessor, AG Sessions, recused himself from the Russia investigation (which became the Mueller investigation) because it presented a fact pattern in which Sessions had been an active participant: The FBI and DOJ were conducting a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s purported \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia, under circumstances in which Sessions had been a top delegate of the Trump campaign and had had contacts with Russian officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine is nothing like that. Again, we do not know if the reported Ukrainian activities are part of Durham\u2019s probe, but Barr was not a government official in 2016. He had no part in the Obama administration\u2019s dealings with Ukrainian officials. Moreover, as outlined above, he also had no role in President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine; but even if he had had such a role, the Trump\u2013Zelensky negotiations are not the focus of the Justice Department\u2019s probe of the Russia investigation\u2019s origins.\n\nOf course, if Congress, in its oversight capacity or even if it seeks to impeach the president, decides to explore the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, it is undeniably within Congress\u2019s power to do so. Nevertheless, the fact that Congress chooses to examine the executive branch\u2019s activities is not a basis for the relevant executive-branch officials to be disqualified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Feinstein\u2019s claim, on behalf of Judiciary Committee Democrats, that Attorney General Barr should recuse himself is nonsense, both factually and legally.
