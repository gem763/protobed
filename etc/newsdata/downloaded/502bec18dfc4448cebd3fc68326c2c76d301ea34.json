( WDC ) broke out on the upside today. How should we play it?\n\nIn this daily bar chart of WDC, below, we can see a potential base pattern going back to October. Declines to the $35 area have been bought in December, January and June. Rallies to around the $55-$60 area have capped advances in April, July and August.\n\nToday's move higher changes things and gives us an uptrend from the June low. WDC is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line. A bullish golden cross of the 50-day and 200-day averages can be seen at the beginning of August.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line looks like it can make a new high for the move up today continuing the rise from January. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing to the upside from above the zero line for a fresh go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of WDC, below, we can see a potential double bottom pattern. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line also shows a double bottom but it hasn't risen above the March and April levels. The MACD oscillator is bullish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of WDC, below, we can see the recent upside breakout and a potential price target of $78.\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders who can afford to risk a close below $55 could probe the long side of WDC here, looking for a rally to the $75-$80 area.", "description": "Here's how I'd play it....WDC", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Western Digital Has Made An Upside Breakout", "Here'S How I'D Play It.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jonathan Heller", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/2ae57768-20c8-11e9-82b4-272dcce25539.jpg"}
