It is up to the EU to decide whether to extend Britain\u2019s Oct. 31 deadline for its departure.\n\nAdam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said Brexit was driving a general risk-off tone.\n\n\u201cThings could change very quickly today, depending on the EU response,\u201d Cole said, adding he did not see much downside risk now that a no-deal Brexit was off the table.\n\nMorten Lund, a senior strategist at Nordea, said markets were reacting to the likelihood of a UK election.\n\nThe Japanese yen rose to 108.25 per dollar JPY=EBS, its strongest since Oct. 15, before settling at 108.465, up marginally on the day.

That left the pound more than 1 cent off Monday's five-and-a-half-month high.\n\nAustralia's dollar dropped 0.2% to $0.6840 AUD=D3 as risk aversion knocked a currency considered a barometer for investors' mood.\n\nScandinavian currencies were being watched ahead of central bank meetings in Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe Swedish crown was little changed against the euro at 10.743 crowns per euro EURSEK=D3, while the Norwegian crown continued losses that saw it reach a record low against the euro last week EURNOK=D3.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British five pound banknotes are seen in this picture illustration taken November 14, 2017.
