Last month, the FAANG stocks lost 0.2 per cent of their value.\n\n\u201c[Growth] valuations, from the fundamentals, are really, really stretched and at some point there\u2019s going to be a reversal,\u201d Ms Grassi said.\n\n\u201cIt's the timing that\u2019s the difficult part of it. There is still room to capitalise on growth but it's been going on for quite some time so I think it's legitimate for this to be on everyone's mind and to be considering the risk.\u201d\n\nMs Grassi\u2019s Global Research Enhanced Index Fund still appears on course to capitalise on that growth \u2013 it holds a large exposure to tech stocks such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nValuation spreads\n\n\u201cWe are fundamentally based as an approach and wherever we look, valuation spreads are really wide, which is typically a sign of opportunities. The more open the spread, the more likely we are able to capitalise.\u201d\n\nGlobal market strategist Kerry Craig said the bond market would have to reverse course more substantially for value stocks to advance further.\n\n\u201cI think you have to consider some of the factors around why value would do so well [in September] and basically it was bond yields picked up,\u201d he said. The US 10-year Treasury yield started the month at 1.50 per cent and rose as high as 1.9 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen does value do good? When you have a yield curve that\u2019s steepening but that\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening at the moment,\" Mr Craig said.\n\nHe said investors would need to have a stronger conviction that growth and inflation were going to improve in order to trigger a bond sell-off.\n\n\u201cTo get there, we need the trade war to go away and that\u2019s probably not going to happen.\u201d\n\nFed rate cuts\n\nOn Thursday, the relationship between the US and China soured further, following a report in the South China Morning Post that suggested no progress had been made during high-level talks this week, and that Chinese vice-premier Liu He would be leaving Washington earlier than expected.\n\nMr Craig said expectations of the Federal Reserve continuing to cut rates were also weighing on value stocks.\n\n\u201cThe markets are pricing in a lot of rate cuts from the Fed and sure, they might cut again just once this year but if they cut again, that\u2019s not mid-cycle easing, that\u2019s a rate-cutting cycle and what does that tell you about the economy? It\u2019s not great.\n\n\u201dYou do need some of those big factors to go away and you need bond yields to move higher because that\u2019s when value becomes more persistent and from a top-down perspective, that\u2019s what we\u2019d really need to see to say that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJPMorgan Asset Management is cool about higher risk investments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Bob Michele, global head of fixed income at JPMorgan making the point he\u2019s moving away from high yield and concentrating more on higher quality bonds as we enter the next six to 12 months,\u201d Ms Grassi said.\n\n\u201cOverall, as a group, we feel we are more concerned than we were before. But these moments of uncertainty where we have all these factors at play, effectively for us, they can be opportunities.\n\n\u201cSo when there is uncertainty, you must stay grounded and take the opportunities to go into the market, buy the dips and capitalise when markets are becoming more volatile.\u201d", "description": "JPMorgan believes value is becoming one of the best equity market opportunities globally, so watch out for a sharp rotation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2590acda2aa9a7e36093db82a876d491c884a9ef", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
