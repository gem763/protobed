A court official has predicted that at the start of the process he would likely appeal against last week's ruling that he should stand trial.\n\nThat would potentially drag out a case that is already more than 20 years old.\n\nZuma is expected to appear alongside representatives of Thales, which is accused of paying the bribes. Both Zuma and Thales deny the charges.\n\nThere is also doubt over whether the court will be able to start proceedings straight away.\n\n\"I just don't see how the trial is going to start tomorrow. It takes a whole year to prepare for a trial of this magnitude,\" Johannesburg-based lawyer Tyrone Maseko told AFP.\n\n\"They are not ready for a trial,\" said Maseko, adding that Zuma faces many charges and that a final indictment needs to be defined.\n\nZuma faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering related to the 1990s arms deal struck when he was deputy president to the country's second black president Thabo Mbeki.\n\nHis former financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who allegedly facilitated Thales' payments, was in 2005 found guilty of fraud and corruption and was sentenced to 15 years behind bars.\n\nBut, shortly after Zuma became president in 2009, Shaik was released on medical parole.\n\nAnalysts have warned that if Zuma goes on trial, he will drag down with him many leaders of Nelson Mandela's ANC, which has governed the country since the end of apartheid in 1994.\n\n'The king of corrupt people'\n\nZuma has also been accused of overseeing the mass looting of state assets during his nine-year presidency.\n\nHigh on the list of alleged benefactors is the wealthy Indian-born Gupta business family, who were accused of unfairly obtaining lucrative government contracts and even influencing Zuma's ministerial appointments.\n\nThe country's former anti-corruption watchdog head Thuli Madonsela accused Zuma of being an integral player who opened the doors for individuals and private companies to loot state resources.\n\nAfter duelling with Madonsela in the courts, Zuma was ordered to appoint a commission of inquiry into the corruption scandal - commonly known as \"state capture\". It has been hearing testimonies since August last year.\n\nZuma appeared at the inquiry in July, putting on a defiant performance and denying all wrongdoing.\n\n\"I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people,\" he said, adding that he had been the victim of \"character assassination over 20 years\".\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa, who took over from Zuma, has vowed to tackle deep-seated corruption but faces opposition from senior powerful ANC members, many of whom remain Zuma allies.", "description": "Former President Jacob Zuma faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering related to 1990s arms deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/3a942ef26ab54d9bb44f7a01f2879ea5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
