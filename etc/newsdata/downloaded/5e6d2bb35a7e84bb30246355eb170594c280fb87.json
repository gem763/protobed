Well, thanks to our great readers, we have some solid tips about proper etiquette and safety in the country, as well as advice about all the wonderful locations you can visit. Here's some of the highlights.\n\n\u201cThe standard tourist spots are the Qutab Minar, Red Fort, and Humayun\u2019s Tomb. The amazing places to visit that aren\u2019t on the usual tourist circuit: Agrasen ki Baoli, a medieval stepwell that\u2019s surrounded by apartment buildings, Lodhi Garden (a park which has picnics, runners, and Sultanate era tombs all together), and the Hauz Khas District Park (tombs, lake, picnics, runners; and rabbit and deer enclosures to the side).\u201d \u2014 delhiexile\n\n\u201cIf you opt to wear Indian clothing (which is fun to wear \u2014 so colourful and sometimes even sparkly! \u2014 and way easier to tolerate in the heat), have an experienced sari wearer help you wrap yourself up so you don\u2019t resemble a rainbow burrito. Also, the blouse and petticoat are the UNDERWEAR for the sari \u2014 they aren\u2019t garments by themselves, so don\u2019t treat them as separates.\u201d \u2014 TheYellowLentil\n\n\u201cI would also recommend visiting the Hauz Khas Village for a fun afternoon \u2014 it has a great park with some ruins which you can explore, and right outside are a few streets with a very cool vibe as well as some great pubs/places to get a drink or a bite. Cars are not allowed into the area and you have to get out of your car/cab right outside the \u2018village\u2019 and walk 10 mins in.\u201d \u2014 shubhangam\n\n\u201cEach state has a bhavan (literal meaning house) allocated to them. Some of these houses run a canteen which serves dinner for a cheap price. It\u2019s a good option to explore a variety of authentic Indian cuisine without visiting different parts of the country. There is a big difference, cooking style and flavour wise, between restaurant food and what people eat at their home. The canteen food is closer to the latter.\u201d \u2014 mmm\n\n\u201cThis was weird, but if you give paper money that isn\u2019t perfectly defect free, the person taking it might not accept it.\u201d \u2014 Stephen\n\n\u201cI would try to go to Rajouri Garden and some of the other old school bazaars; these are way more fun than the malls that now seem to be everywhere.\u201d \u2014 Rishi\n\n\u201cEverywhere you look, New Delhi is in a non-stop rush. The Gurudawara is a great spot to a take a step back and relax for a bit both mentally and physically. Sit inside the temple and listen to kirtan (devotional music) as well as take a walk around the temple, the pool, and the surrounding areas. Sit and enjoy langar which is a free meal given to any and all who are in the temple. You may receive karah parshad, which is a made of wheat, clarified butter, and sugar.\u201d \u2014 JS1323", "description": "Thinking about travelling to Delhi, India's capital, in the near future?
