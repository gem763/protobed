You\u2019re with these people more than anyone else, and in a very vulnerable way. Everyone\u2019s doing it to reach this one goal, and everything\u2019s stripped away.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for ego or personal achievements. Everyone has to be on board. Having all of that, it\u2019s tough to lose someone. Jill, being the leader of our team, all she\u2019s led us through, all the wins, the ups and downs, the different lineups and formations and doubts, and to accomplish our goal, it\u2019s something really special.\u201d\n\nEllis choked up speaking of her five-year run as coach, saying it got to her just before the team took the field before 33,027 fans at Soldier Field.\n\n\u201cWhen you get in the moment, you kind of push through, but when I was high-fiving the players on the way out onto the field I got kind of choked up,\u201d Ellis said, barely finishing the sentence. \u201cThey\u2019re a good group.\u201d\n\nEllis, 53, picked up her American-record 106th win Thursday night against South Korea. She was honored before the game with a jersey signed by the team and 132 written on the back, signifying the number of games she coached in a career that began with two stints as interim coach in 2012 and 2014. Her two world coach of the year honors came in 2015 and this year following the back-to-back American victories in the Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\n\u201cMy legacy, that\u2019s someone else\u2019s narrative to write,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me writing my legacy or what I hope it to be. I\u2019ve tried to always give everything I have to this job and with passion. I feel good about that. \u201cThe best part of this job is building relationships. I\u2019m not going to remember games so much as I\u2019m going to remember all these people who helped me get where I am.\u201d\n\nCaptain Carli Lloyd scored in the 37th minute and saw a potential winning goal ruled offside in the 93rd minute to climax a furious final stage.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to send Jill out with another win,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, tough year for everybody but those last few minutes were exciting. We\u2019ve won a ton with her.\u201d\n\nJi So-yun scored for South Korea.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ellis choked up speaking of her five-year run as coach, saying it got to her just before the team took the field before 33,027 fans at Soldier Field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/South_Korea_US_Soccer_99617.jpg-5ae45_c0-0-4000-2332_s1770x1032.jpg?6fa6f1358e32f79a7430670803768e97648eaf7e", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
