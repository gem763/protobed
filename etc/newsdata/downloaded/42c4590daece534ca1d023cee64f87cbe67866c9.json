Mitt Romney (R-Utah) a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d and even taking aim at steadfast ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nThose that stick by Trump, meanwhile, will get special attention.\n\nAfter Sen. Ron Johnson defended Trump in The Wall Street Journal and on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u2014 even echoing Trump-backed conspiracy theories that left some Republicans scratching their heads \u2014 the Wisconsin Republican received a call from the president that very day.\n\nThe senator wouldn\u2019t divulge the contents of the call, but it\u2019s safe to say Trump was pleased. He later tweeted an endorsement of Johnson and condemnation of NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd.\n\n\u201cHe monitors most things very carefully, as you know. And I think that this is no exception. He watches a lot of TV, and we have a lot of members who are on, making statements in the media. And I think he pays attention to what they say,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said. \u201cHis operating style is to be engaged with what other people are saying.\u201d\n\nAnd as Republicans twist amid the fast-moving Ukraine scandal and the president\u2019s unpopular decision to withdraw from Syria, what\u2019s become clear is no one wants to be on Team Romney.\n\nRomney uncorked Trump\u2019s fury for expressing concern over Trump\u2019s calls for China and Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden: The president called him a \u201cfool.\u201d The moment was instructive: No other Republican joined Romney in condemning Trump\u2019s behavior so fiercely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have other senators coming up and saying, 'How can I join you in receiving the wrath of the White House?'\u201d Romney said in an interview.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s loudest defenders on impeachment can\u2019t escape the president.\n\nGraham\u2019s on-again, off-again criticisms of the president\u2019s Syria policy became too much for Trump, with the president publicly dismissing the senator on Wednesday and telling him to concentrate on his job running the Judiciary Committee.\n\nAnd with Trump still popular among the party base, Republicans are trying to engineer a partisan impeachment vote for the president.\n\nGraham visited House Republicans on Wednesday to talk about his experience as a manager during the Clinton impeachment trial and emphasized what he sees as flaws in House Democrats\u2019 process so far.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in for the ride of your lives. Get ready for it,\u201d Graham told members, according to Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.). \u201cKeep fighting, keep doing what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019re in for a rough fight.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans also discussed impeachment at length on Wednesday, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prepping his caucus to finish a trial soon as Christmas.\n\nThe thinking in the GOP is if House Republicans stick together, Senate Republicans will as well. And then Trump will get party unity.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an almost-partisan vote in the House, it\u2019ll be an almost-partisan vote in the Senate,\u201d said one Senate Republican familiar with party strategy.\n\nThose making even the slightest break with the president are choosing their words wisely, pairing any criticism of Trump with attacks on Democrats.\n\nA growing number of senators are taking the line that Trump\u2019s efforts to recruit foreign governments to dig up dirt on political opponents were not necessarily proper, but that the House is overreaching and is the real bad actor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation \u2014 I look at it and go: Is it wise or not? ... Should he have allowed other people to have those dialogues? Probably,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the latest Republican to take this measured approach. \u201cIs it impeachable? No.\u201d\n\nIt appears to be working, at least if the goal is to stay in the president\u2019s good graces. Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) mildly took issue with the president\u2019s mention of Biden in his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; neither has experienced a mean tweet or an angry call from the president.\n\n\u201cObviously you would have disagreements with somebody,\u201d Cornyn said after delivering a lengthy floor speech criticizing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process on Wednesday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of a test of a relationship \u2014 if you can have honest disagreements and still have the relationship survive.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Cornyn sent out a fundraising solicitation that made clear he and Trump are on fine terms: \u201cIf you can't stand the thought of seeing President Trump run out of office for no reason, CHIP IN NOW TO DEFEND HIM.\u201d\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Sen.
