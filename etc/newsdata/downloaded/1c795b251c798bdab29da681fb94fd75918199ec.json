The searches are customizable to allow people to search for a particular type of treatment or to find a provider that takes their insurance, such as Medicaid.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cToo often people will just type into a search bar, need treatment,\u201d Conway said on a call with reporters. \u201cFor years, if not decades, there has been an insufficient response to such a search.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the last major overhaul of the treatment search website hosted by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was in 2002, and this update will make the system much easier to use.\n\nThe website will show thousands of medical providers, which officials said are regulated and certified at the state level.\n\n\u201cIf treatment options are not readily accessible and available then opportunity may be lost,\u201d said Elinore McCance-Katz, the head of SAMHSA.\n\nMore than 70,000 people died of a drug overdose in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "description": "The White House on Wednesday launched a website aimed at making it easier for people to find addiction treatment, with a particular focus on fighting the opioid epidemic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/prescriptiondrugspills_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
