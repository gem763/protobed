Asked how troubling they find the allegations against the former vice-president, 32 per cent said not at all \u2013 while only 19 per cent said they found the claims \u201cextremely\u201d troubling.\n\nIn turn, the majority of respondents - 38 per cent - said they found Mr Trump\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian president extremely troubling, compared to 26 per cent who said the situation was not troubling at all.\n\nMeanwhile 66 per cent said it was not appropriate for the president to ask foreign leaders to investigate his rivals \u2013 compared to 25 per cent who said such actions would be appropriate.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
