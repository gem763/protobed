Accompanied by another congressman from the Palmetto state, Laurence M. Keitt, Brooks waited until Sumner was almost alone on the floor of the Senate and then approached him. He called Sumner\u2019s speech a \u201clibel on South Carolina,\u201d and then raised a thick gold-capped cane over Sumner\u2019s head and began to strike him. Brooks continued to deliver blows to Sumner\u2019s head until his stout cane broke and Sumner collapsed in a pool of blood on the floor. When several senators came to Sumner\u2019s defense, Keitt brandished a pistol in their face and warned them to keep away. Sumner barely escaped with his life and was incapacitated for a full three years.\n\nBrooks, however, became a hero to his fellow fire-breathing white South Carolinians. Dozens sent him new canes, one inscribed with the legend \u201cHit him again!\u201d He died a few months later, after surviving an effort to expel him from the House. But his legacy lived on. As South Carolinians opened the first volleys of the Civil War three years later, wags up north talked of \u201cPoor South Carolina\u2013too small to be a country, too large to be an insane asylum.\u201d\n\nJudged against the Brooks and Keitt standard, South Carolina Congressman Addison Graves (\u201cJoe\u201d) Wilson\u2019s disruption of President Obama\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress last week with the words \u201cYou lie!\u201d looks pretty pale. On the other hand, the flow of support he received from the array of birthers, tenthers, and deathers who now call the G.O.P. home seemed predictable. More than any development in recent memory, it demonstrated the inversion of the Republican Party. No longer is it a party that identifies with Lincoln and Sumner. The G.O.P. of 2009 is led by forty- and fifty-something white men with romantic (and delusional) longings for the antebellum south. Take Joe Wilson.\n\nIn 2003, Wilson attacked Strom Thurmond\u2019s natural biracial daughter, Essie Mae Washington-Williams, saying her public acknowledgement of her parentage shortly after Thurmond\u2019s death was \u201ca smear\u201d designed to \u201cdiminish Thurmond\u2019s legacy.\u201d Wilson launched his political career working as an aide to Senator Thurmond and has continuously held the staunch segregationist as a hero.\n\nNow Max Blumenthal probes more deeply into Wilson\u2019s relationship with a radical Neoconfederate organization entitled the Sons of Confederate Veterans, SCV for short:\n\nWho are the SCV?\u2026 By 2006\u2026 the SCV had been substantially taken over by an organized cadre of white supremacists who sought to turn the nation\u2019s oldest Southern historical society into what the veteran white supremacy activist Kirk Lyons called \u201ca modern, 21st century Christian war machine capable of uniting the Confederate community and leading it to ultimate victory,\u201d had seized much of the SCV\u2019s leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an extensive list of SCV officials who belonged to \u201chate groups.\u201d Lyons, a key member of this new leadership, had harbored dreams of creating a seemingly benign front group for a more sophisticated version of the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cI have great respect for the Klan historically, but, sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive,\u201d Lyons told a German neo-Nazi magazine in 1992. \u201cIt would be good if the Klan followed the advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: \u2018Become invisible. Hang the robes and hoods in the cupboard and become an underground organization.\u2019\u201d With the SCV, Lyons discovered he didn\u2019t have to go underground after all. Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV, the organization\u2019s political newsletter, The Southern Mercury, was transformed into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying members of the SCV until it folded in 2008, the Mercury published articles describing blacks as genetically inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as \u201ca childlike people,\u201d and warned that if Obama runs for re-election, race riots of an \u201cexceedingly violent nature\u201d would immediately ensue, leaving \u201centire sections of some of our cities in ruins.\u201d\n\nNo doubt about it. Preston Brooks would approve. And so, evidently, does Joe Wilson.", "description": "", "authors": ["Scott Horton", "Donna Edwards", "Mary Anne Franks", "David Law", "Lawrence Lessig", "Louis Michael Seidman", "Adam Wilson", "Andrew Cockburn", "Alejandro Varela", "Kenneth E.
