That magnificent Salford, on a fraction of the budget of the big guns, made the Grand Final was a miracle in itself. Regardless of the valiant defeat, those who had made the shortest of journeys would paint the dirty old town red on Saturday night - and they had every right to.\n\nMorgan Knowles scored St Helens' first try in their Betfred Super League Grand Final against Salford Red Devils\n\nZeb Taia scored his side's second try shortly after as St Helens made a flying start to the encounter at Old Trafford\n\nMark Percival effectively sealed victory for St Helens when he ran onto his own brilliant weighted pass and crossed the tryline\n\nAt Old Trafford, just four miles from home, the other Red Devils finally met their match in Justin Holbrook's brilliant Saints. The best team in the competition took hold of a gripping contest from the off and refused to let it out of their grasp, despite Salford's brave efforts. Those who follow the men wearing the famous red 'v' will have been sick of reading all about their opponents in the build up. Quite rightly, the glory is theirs. The honour, however, belongs to the defeated underdog.\n\nThis was Salford's first visit to the big show. Put simply, this does not happen. Rugby league has its traditional powerhouses. Since the Grand Final was introduced in 1998, just seven different teams have appeared. It is now eight. Each year, Salford battle against relegation. At a meeting before the season started, Super League officials urged staff at the cash-strapped club to aim for 11th out of 12. They were trying to be helpful, trying to help ensure that Salford, still reeling from the departure of former owner Marwan Koukash and his money, survived.\n\nBut they were having none of it at the AJ Bell Stadium. Not this year, not this team. Assembled for around half the price of the top sides in the competition, the self-titled misfits have defied the odds week after week.\n\nLuke Thompson was the pick of the players on show at Old Trafford as the prop helped to power St Helens to victory\n\nLachlan Coote's kicking remained ice cold throughout, with three his three conversions adding gloss to the final scoreline\n\nTommy Makinson (left) is congratulated by team-mate Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook (right) after kicking a late drop goal\n\nThat said, not all of them expected to be here. Second rower Josh Jones had to put back his wedding to Sunday. He may well be walking up the aisle with a fuzzy head. He will certainly be sore - as will man of the match Luke Thompson. The prop was immense for the victors.\n\nSalford's feat over the course of a historic season is hard to compare. Rugby league is not football. You cannot grab a goal on the break, sit back and defend it. Over 80, brutal minutes, the best team tends to win. That is what happened here.\n\nSt Helens finished top of the table by 16 points. They are widely recognised as the best outfit in Super League by some distance. But on the big stage in recent years, a reputation for choking has stalked them. They had not won the Grand Final since 2014. In August, they lost the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley to an injury-ravaged Warrington side that had no right to get anywhere near them. They clearly had no intention of allowing that to happen again. Tries from Morgan Knowles, Zeb Taia and a wonderful solo effort from Mark Percival along with some fine kicking from Lachlan Coote, ensured that it did not. Saints were as relentless as they were clinical.\n\nDefeated Salford coach Ian Watson was understandably proud of a team that were 150/1 outsiders at the start of the season for good reason.\n\n'I've just told them that they need to be really proud of themselves,' he said. 'The adventure they have been on to create the buzz in the city when United are people's number one team and you've got City with every kid wanting to play for both of them. For them to create that buzz - it's credit to them and the backroom staff. It's been amazing, bigger than simply getting to a Grand Final. The boys have got people to fall in love with their rugby team again.'\n\nWhile there was no doubting that Saints were worthy champions, Salford could feel aggrieved at a couple of decisions from referee Chris Kendall that did not go their way.\n\nJustin Holbrook's side were far too good for a Salford side who were 150/1 outsiders at the start of the Super League season\n\nWatson, however, had no interest in criticism. 'I'll just jump back to Saints being the best team,' he said. 'Perhaps there are things to look at but they deserve their win.'\n\nSalford, whose only try came from winger Jake Bibby, will now lose some of their best players including star man Jackson Hastings, who will join big guns Wigan. Watson believes the money generated from their final run, along with increased crowds can help put them on an even keel \u2013 and ensure the kit washers get paid.\n\n'We've been clearing debts, trying to get on a level playing field,' he explained. 'Local businesses, even the local launderette.'\n\nDeparting Saints coach Holbrook will reflect on a job well done as he reclines on his seat on the flight back to Australia.\n\n'I'm just satisfied and so happy that we've finally got what we worked so hard for,' he said. 'I've loved it here. It's been a great three years and the players deserve this trophy more than anyone. We had to deliver and we did. We know we've fallen in the past, I know how much this means to our town.'\n\nIf Salford's former resident LS Lowry was still alive he may well have painted a scene from outside Old Trafford. The day they were all going to the match. It was just a shame for almost everyone outside St Helens that they did not win it.\n\nSt Helens players celebrate at the end of the game after securing a deserved victory over a plucky Salford side on Saturday\n\n\n\n", "description": "St Helens won the Super League Grand final with a dominant 23-6 victory over Salford Red Devils at Old Trafford on Saturday.
