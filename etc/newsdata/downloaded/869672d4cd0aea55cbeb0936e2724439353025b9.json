In the streaming era, no such metric exists.\n\nAnd although Nielsen has begun putting out ratings for some streaming properties like Netflix, the streamers don't rely on them. Netflix famously called Nielsen's estimates \"inaccurate\" when they were first debuted in 2017.\n\nCase-in-point: Hulu, which currently owns the streaming rights for Seinfeld, reportedly paid $130 million for the rights to stream the show domestically over 6 years starting in 2015 (Amazon currently has the international rights). Netflix, meanwhile, reportedly paid more than $500 million for the global streaming rights for Seinfeld over 5 years starting in 2021.\n\nYes, but: There is some consensus among analysts that older shows, sometimes dubbed \"catalog content\" by industry professionals, help reduce subscriber \"churn,\" or subscriber losses.\n\nThe idea is that while investing in new content may be an effective way to draw a subscriber in, the way to keep them from canceling their subscriptions once they've finished new content is to give them access to deep libraries of old classics.\n\nEven for streamers like Netflix that have already spent years building big libraries of original and licensed content, catalog content is critical\u2014 hence Netflix's big investment in Seinfeld.\n\nWhat to watch: Streamers will eventually need to invest in their own versions of what will one day be considered catalog content. Netflix and Hulu have been able to do this with a few popular original series like \"Orange is the New Black\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"\n\nGo deeper: Streaming's cancel culture problem", "description": "There is some consensus among industry analysts that older shows help with subscriber retention.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ie1xGRoKZjq4Z1TDvxCjaz-sdUw=/0x52:3000x1740/1920x1080/2019/09/22/1569175760428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
