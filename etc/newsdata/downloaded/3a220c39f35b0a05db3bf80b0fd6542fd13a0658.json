French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said, \u201cPresident Trump doesn\u2019t seem to have opposed the operation the Turks are carrying out today, even though much firmer positions are being asserted today.\u201d\n\nIt is important for U.S. troops and for the U.S. public to hear the Pentagon\u2019s civilian leader explain military policies. And Esper, to his credit, isn\u2019t hiding from the media. But the contortions he\u2019s performing to justify the president\u2019s decisions are painful to watch: \u201cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cand U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President Erdo\u011fan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation.\u201d\n\nBoth the president and Esper make it sound as though there were no alternatives to either fighting a two-front war against both Syria and Turkey or completely withdrawing U.S. forces. This is the kind of straw man that made Republicans scoff at President Barack Obama and his acolytes, when they suggested they had to either abandon Iraq or avoid Syria. There is a wider range of choices available than doing nothing or landing an invasion force at Normandy, to use Trump\u2019s favorite test of allied worth.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kori Schake", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive What-Trump-Should-Have-Said-Erdogan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
