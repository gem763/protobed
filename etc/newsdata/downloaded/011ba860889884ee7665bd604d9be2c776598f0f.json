Should I call the police?'\n\n'I was starting to think wasn't being heard, that my original ''no'' like, how else can I say no?'\n\nWhen confronted by A Current Affair, Singh initially denied it was him who asked Ms Horrigan for sexual favours, but eventually he admitted to his comments.\n\nSingh acknowledged his comments were inappropriate, and offered an apology to Ms Horrigan.\n\n'I don't know to be honest... like I have no words to say, I would just like to say sorry,' he said.\n\nUber refunded Ms Horrigan's fare, but she said their response to her complaint was disappointing.\n\n'I will be reviewing whether this partner will continue to have access to the app. We will do our best to not pair you with this driver in the future,' the ride share company told Ms Horrigan.\n\n'It was just as if it was no big deal, as if I left my phone in the back of the car or something,' she said.\n\nUber confirmed they removed Singh as a driver and cut off his access to the app, but the company failed to tell Ms Horrigan of his dismissal.\n\nSingh now works as a taxi driver, and claims he won't make inappropriate comments to his customers in the future.", "description": "An Uber driver was recorded asking a young woman if she wanted to become 'friends with benefits' instead of paying her fare.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/11/19735450-0-image-a-25_1571135039726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
