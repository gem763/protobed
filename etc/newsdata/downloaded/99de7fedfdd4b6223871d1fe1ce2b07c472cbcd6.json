If it\u2019s passed and then the final vote is pulled- those two things still happen anyway. Benn has a midnight deadline whatever \u2013 and govt bringing leg on Monday. \u2014 Anushka Asthana (@AnushkaAsthana) October 19, 2019\n\nBREAKING: If Letwin passes No 10 will pull the vote pic.twitter.com/RyvdxtV3MT \u2014 Tim Shipman (@ShippersUnbound) October 19, 2019\n\nBut his plan to get Parliament to approve his Brexit deal with the European Union has been thrown into doubt.\n\nLawmakers will first vote on whether to withhold approval until legislation to implement the agreement has been passed. That would bring another law into play that would force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay from the European Union.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow said would he would allow a vote on an amendment that essentially puts the vote on the deal off until another day.\n\nThose behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the UK could leave the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31 because the law is not in place.\n\nIf Letwin amendment renders today\u2019s vote meaningless, Number 10 will go even harder on the message that this is an obstructionist parliament that only backs \u2018dither and delay\u2019 \u2014 James Forsyth (@JGForsyth) October 19, 2019\n\nHear Letwin was calling Lord Pannick from No10 when he went in there for talks. Senior Tory: \u2018This isn't Letwin's amendment, it's Pannick's amendment, Pannick is the organ grinder \u2013 Letwin's just the useful idiot.' \u2014 Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) October 19, 2019", "description": "(AP) -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Parliament that his new Brexit deal can heal the rift in British politics and unite warring factions.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Sir-Oliver-Letwin-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
