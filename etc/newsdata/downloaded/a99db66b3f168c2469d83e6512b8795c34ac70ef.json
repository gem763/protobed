REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nChopra, 37, a former Miss World who became a star in both Hollywood and Bollywood, and Jonas, 26, topped People\u2019s annual best dressed list in an eclectic slate that included actor Billy Porter and tennis champion Serena Williams along with style-setting veterans such as Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and Celine Dion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever that we have had a man or a couple on the Top 10 list, let alone as the best dressed. But it really felt like these two deserved it,\u201d People\u2019s style and beauty director, Andrea Lavinthal, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe combination of the two of them is so exciting to watch. (Jonas) is not exactly someone who just wears a black tuxedo and stands next to her on the red carpet. You can tell that he enjoys fashion as much as she does,\u201d Lavinthal added.\n\nChopra, who became the first Indian to headline a U.S. television drama series as the star of \u201cQuantico,\u201d married the younger of the three Jonas Brothers musicians in New Delhi in December 2018, becoming one of the most sought-after celebrity couples in the world.\n\nLavinthal praised Chopra and Jonas for embracing different styles and designers but always looking good.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do matchy-matchy but they still look like they go together,\u201d she said. \u201cEven walking down the street in New York City, they are not in jeans and a T-shirt or casual pants. She is in a head to toe look, and so is he.\u201d\n\nPorter, the Emmy-nominated star of TV series \u201cPose\u201d about New York\u2019s LGBTQ ballroom culture in the 1980s, was deemed the \u201cDisruptor\u201d on People\u2019s Top 10 best dressed list.\n\nPorter, 49, turned heads when he walked the Oscar red carpet in February in a black velvet tuxedo ball gown, and at the Met Gala in May dressed as an glittering Egyptian sun god with gold wings.\n\nLavinthal said Porter\u2019s appearances \u201cnever felt they were just for the sake of being outrageous or costumey. It was really the start of a conversation about what is considered gender appropriate.\u201d\n\nPeople magazine\u2019s 20-page style feature in this week\u2019s magazine hits U.S. newsstands on Friday.\n\nThe full list can be seen here. here", "description": "Actress Priyanka Chopra and her pop star husband Nick Jonas were named the best dressed of 2019 by People magazine on Wednesday, marking the first time in the celebrity magazine's history that a couple has shared top style honors.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426140462&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8312B"}
