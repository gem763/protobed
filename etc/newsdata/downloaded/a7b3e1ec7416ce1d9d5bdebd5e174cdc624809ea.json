Last month a senior fellow at the CEI published an op-ed in the Atlantic arguing against the antitrust probe launched by 50 state attorneys general into Google.\n\nAnother organization named on the list is the right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation. Google's involvement with the Heritage Foundation came under heavy fire earlier this year when it announced the appointment of Kay Coles James, the foundation's president, to its AI ethics council which collapsed after a week.\n\nKay Coles James sits next to Donald Trump during a meeting of conservative leaders in January.

Over a thousand employees signed a petition to have James ousted, and the following week Google disbanded the council entirely.\n\nA Google spokesperson told the Guardian that just because Google donates to climate change denying groups, \"[it] does not mean we endorse the organizations' entire agenda.\"\n\n\"We're hardly alone among companies that contribute to organizations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,\" the spokesperson said. The company declined to tell The Guardian how much it had donated to these groups.\n\nGoogle was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.", "description": "Google donates to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which was reportedly key to President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Accord.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cd2ddd0021b4c09ea4e02f5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
