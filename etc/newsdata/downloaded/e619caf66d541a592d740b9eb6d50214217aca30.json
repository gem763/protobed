Although in-game purchases have so far been slower than cash cow Fire Emblem Heroes.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Mario Kart Tour is a disgrace that Nintendo should be ashamed of \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\nMORE: Mario Kart Tour review \u2013 a race for your money\n\nMORE: Mario Kart Tour has \u00a34.99 monthly subscription and no multiplayer", "description": "The next big update for Mario Kart Tour has added new tracks, characters, and car parts - as well as the worst microtransactions so far.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_1-8daa_1570634353.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
