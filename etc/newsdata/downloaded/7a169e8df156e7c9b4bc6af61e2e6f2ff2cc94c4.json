The tweets \"target\" and \"harass\" the whistleblower, as well as others involved in the complaint and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Harris wrote.\n\nHarris also cited Mr. Trump's tweet insinuating a \"civil war\" could erupt if the impeachment process continues, and another in which he called the impeachment process \"a COUP.\" \"Hey, @jack. Time to do something about this,\" she wrote.\n\n\"These are blatant threats,\" Harris wrote in her letter to Dorsey. \"We need a civil society, not a civil war. These tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety, all while making blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger.\"\n\nTwitter told CBS News it has received the letter and intends to respond.\n\nTwitter's user agreement prohibits content that promotes violence against an identifiable target, and states it will remove users from the platform when applicable. \"We have a zero-tolerance policy against violent threats,\" the platform said.\n\nTwitter has long struggled with how to handle hate speech and the spread of disinformation on the platform, especially when it comes to political figures. In June, the platform said it would continue to allow politicians and government officials to violate certain rules, considering the debate to be in the interests of the public. However, Twitter said it may put a notice on those tweets and not elevate them in the algorithm.\n\nAs for Harris's request, \"It's going nowhere,\" according to Wired editor-in-chief and CBS News contributor Nick Thompson. He told CBSN, \"I mean, this is \u2014 Twitter's not going to ban Donald Trump. They've created an exemption for him.\"\n\n\"They're not gonna ban Donald Trump,\" he continued. \"This debate has been had \u2014 Twitter's had it internally. They're not gonna do it. Kamala Harris knows that. She's just saying this to get attention and get us to talk about it.\"\n\nHarris's letter cited a number of users who have been suspended or banned by Twitter for harassment and disinformation in the past, including InfoWars host Alex Jones, \"Pharma Bro\" Martin Shkreli and actor James Woods.\n\n\"No user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter's user agreement, not even the President of the United States,\" she wrote.", "description": "President Trump has used Twitter to attack those involved in the whistleblower complaint against him", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/85780dfa-8d18-4cfe-bdbf-0a739ddacd5f/thumbnail/1200x630/1d0661444dbb15d2ffa9c5505b5bd378/trump-kamala-twitter.jpg"}
