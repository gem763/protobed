That was mainly due to the RSI bull div and the ADX rollover. I mentioned that final confirmation would come from a break of the 4-hour Lucid SAR, which just occurred. Now all systems are a go,\u201d he explained in a tweet from yesterday.\n\nIn yesterday's podcast I explained why I think that $BTC is ready for a bounce.

Wrong below 7800. Partially based on the chart and partially based on the data set below,\u201d he explained while pointing to the tweet seen below that shows the major gains BTC typically incurs after the CME futures expire.\n\nExpecting upside on $BTC towards 9k.
