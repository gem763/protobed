He said the Trump family property was chosen after White House teams scouted a dozen properties as potential sites.\n\nMulvaney downplayed questions about the appearance of a conflict of interest for the president, insisting that there would be no profit and that the resort was \"far and away the best choice.\"\n\n\"I get the criticisms. So does [Trump]\u2026 but no, there\u2019s no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form,\" Mulvaney said. \"If you think it's going to help his brand, that's great, but I would suggest that he doesn't need much help promoting his brand.\"\n\nTrump was the one who encouraged Doral be considered, Mulvaney said, which further inflamed criticism.\n\nThe announcement immediately drew backlash. Critics viewed it as a blatant violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prevents elected officials from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign governments.\n\nDemocrats quickly sought details of the contract for Doral, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pledged to add the use of the Trump property for the G-7 to an ongoing Emoluments Clause lawsuit against the president.\n\n\"This is corruption, plain and simple,\" tweeted Sen.

Multiple current and former administration officials have cooperated with House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry into the president, and Republicans have come out in force to criticize Trump over his foreign policy in Syria.\n\nTwo of the most damaging revelations came during Mulvaney's Thursday presser: That Doral would host the G-7 and the admission that aid for Ukraine was tied to an investigation into Democrats involved in the 2016 election lead-up. Both have since been undercut or reversed over the course of 60 hours as the White House seeks to do damage control.\n\nIn another contradiction of Mulvaney, Trump floated Camp David as a potential new host site. The Maryland retreat hosted the last G-7 in the United States in 2012, though Mulvaney told reporters Thursday that he heard those involved in that event \"thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7.\"\n\nMulvaney said the White House had considered a dozen sites, which included spots in California, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.\n\nThe final four sites included Doral, two spots in Utah and one in Hawaii, according to Mulvaney.", "description": "President Trump on Saturday said\u00a0he would no longer host next year's Group of Seven (G-7) summit at his Doral resort after intense backlash from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and some Republican lawmakers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101219getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
