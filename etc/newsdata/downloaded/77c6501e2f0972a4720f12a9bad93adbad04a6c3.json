The main take-away is that American teens are not getting enough sleep, which damages their mental and physical health, education, and even ability to drive safely.\n\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, teenagers need at least nine and a half hours of sleep every night. However, the National Sleep Foundation\u2019s 2014 Sleep in America Poll reports that less than half of American children get at least nine hours of sleep each night, and 58 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds regularly sleep fewer than seven hours each night. Since poll respondents tend to overestimate the number of hours they sleep, actual nightly sleep totals are likely lower than these self-reported averages.\n\nChronic sleep loss contributes to higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and obesity. Long-term deprivation has also been shown to be a factor in lower test scores, decreased attention span, tardiness, concentration, and overall academic achievement.\n\nThis information is becoming more widely known, but many parents acknowledge that their kids still don\u2019t get enough sleep. The National Sleep Foundation reports that while 90 percent of parents place \u201cgreat value\u201d on sleep, one quarter of those same parents report that their children regularly get an hour less than what\u2019s recommended.\n\nMoving bedtimes earlier is not going to fix the problem, particularly for adolescents. Teens stay up later not because they don\u2019t want to go to sleep, but because they can\u2019t. Due to the delayed release of melatonin in the adolescent brain and a lack of \u201csleep drive\u201d in response to fatigue, teens do not feel sleepy until much later at night than young children or adults and have difficulty falling asleep, even when they are tired.\n\nThat\u2019s why the American Academy of Pediatrics is focusing on school start times. \u201cAlthough many changes over the course of adolescence can affect the quality and quantity of sleep, one of the most salient and, arguably, most malleable is that of school start times,\u201d it says.\n\nIn the handful of districts where start times have been delayed by one hour, students did not shift their bedtimes later, resulting in a net gain of one extra hour of sleep on school nights. Those children arrived at school more rested and, according to the report, experienced \u201cless daytime sleepiness, less tardiness, fewer attention/concentration difficulties, and better academic performance compared with middle school students at earlier-starting schools.\u201d", "description": "A new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0says delaying the day may help teens get more rest.", "authors": ["Jessica Lahey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/08/6156719075_c075821d86_o/facebook.jpg?1522687065", "published_at": "2014-08-25"}
