Plus, a Canadian far-right outlet and its power to radicalise via YouTube.\n\nCovering the return of Egypt's protesters\n\nCompared with the days of Tahrir Square, the numbers seem insignificant; a few hundred protesters scattered across Egypt calling for an end to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's rule.\n\nBut those demonstrators were the first visible signs of political unrest there in six years.\n\nThe protests were called for by a former military contractor, Mohamed Ali. He has been posting videos online telling tales of rampant corruption and implicating the president himself.\n\nAli's videos have spurred other Egyptians to post their own stories of corruption, including military personnel, which has analysts theorising the real threat to the president may come from within.\n\nDespite this, Egyptian media outlets, known for doing the government's bidding, initially tried to ignore the story - now, they are trying to make it go away.\n\nContributors:\n\nAmr Khalifa - analyst and political columnist\n\nHussein Baoumi - Egypt researcher, Amnesty International\n\nProfessor Dalia Fahmy - associate professor of Political Science, Long Island University\n\nIbrahim Halawi - teaching fellow in International Relations, Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nOn our radar\n\nRichard Gizbert speaks to producer Tariq Nafi about the hate directed at 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in the news and online.\n\nThe right perspective? YouTube, radicalisation and Rebel Media\n\nMuslim invaders; feminists out to destroy our way of life; a coming white genocide - these are among the online obsessions of the far-right.\n\nThey have been weaponised and monetised by some skilful provocateurs on YouTube, producing viral content that is capable of not only radicalising the views of those who watch it, but of driving some to acts of violence.\n\nAmong the best-known practitioners of the art are The Rebel Media, a small Canadian outlet whose contributors have included names like Hopkins, Robinson, and Gorka - people known for peddling some toxic tropes at home and happy to be granted an outlet offshore.\n\nThe Listening Post's Flo Philips goes down the far-right rabbit hole and into the YouTube outlets radicalising their viewers.\n\nContributors:\n\nMichael Coren - columnist and broadcaster\n\nJonathan Goldsbie - editor, Canadaland\n\nAmira Elghawaby - board member, Canadian Anti-Hate Network\n\nJared Holt - investigative reporter, Right Wing Watch\n\nCaleb Cain - former Rebel Media viewer\n\nSource: Al Jazeera News", "description": "Viral videos revealing rampant corruption trigger protests in Egypt.
