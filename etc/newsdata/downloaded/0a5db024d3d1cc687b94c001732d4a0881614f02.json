Jesse Marlow\n\nAndrew Robb-chaired Global Brands Australia is still in the midst of a pre-IPO fundraising round. But those on the receiving end of its increasingly frantic pitches are getting the impression that it's not going very well.\n\nSince August, fundraiser Gobarralong Capital has been approaching those on Robb's extensive rolodex with the arresting information that the former trade minister wanted Gobarralong to \"reach out on his behalf with his latest pre-IPO investment opportunity\".\n\nWhich is how the sausage gets made. But not, usually, with quite this level of persistence. Would-be investors were told the business needed \"firm commitments\" in August. Then, they were contacted again, and told the round would close September 13. But even this week, some were still getting chased up about the opportunity, now closing this Friday! Robb himself is happy to take calls, would-be investors were assured earlier this week. He's given up his $900,000 gig consulting with Landbridge, so presumably he's got the time.\n\nOf course, even with Robb on board, everyone knows that the harder they have to work to get you to invest, the less likely you are to want to.\n\nGlobal Brands is trying to raise $7.5 million at 15\u00a2 a share, mostly to pay for its purchase of the Celebrity Slim business and inventory (reportedly being finalised this Saturday). The remainder will fund working capital and costs associated with its IPO, planned for later this year. As well as the weight-loss shakes, Global Brands also owns a number of beauty brands including Li'Tya, Earth Spa, and Sacred Energies, the last of which, to quote the website, draws upon \"ancient elements and understandings of traditional Chinese medicines, intertwining them with even older ancient indigenous Aboriginal teachings and medicines\".", "description": "Those on the receiving end of Global Brands Australia's increasingly frantic pitches are getting the impression that it's not going very well.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1a78a60617e4e214ed2bd655ba4536db5e21e827", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
