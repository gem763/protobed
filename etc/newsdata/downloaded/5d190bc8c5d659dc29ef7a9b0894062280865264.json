Security forces said at least 40 of its members were injured in the clashes. Protesters were also injured.\n\nPolice showed restraint as they were pelted with stones for several hours, firing volleys of tear gas only after protesters broke through the first security barrier near the government house. Police chased protesters through the streets of Beirut\u2019s commercial district through the night.\n\nThe protests could plunge Lebanon into a political crisis with unpredictable repercussions for the economy which has been in steady decline. Some of the protesters said they would stay in the streets until the government resigns.\n\n\u201cThe government is trying to help Lebanese citizens avoid a collapse,\u201d Interior Minister Raya al-Hassan, who ruled out the possibility of a Cabinet resignation, told the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV. \u201cIf another government is formed it will take the same measures.\u201d\n\nProtesters closed major intersections with burning tires and garbage containers, causing traffic jams. As the protests escalated, the minister of education declared that public and private schools and universities would close Friday.\n\nYears of regional turmoil \u2014 worsened by an influx of 1.5 million Syrian refugees since 2011 \u2014 are catching up with the small Arab country. Lebanon has the third-highest debt level in the world, currently standing at about $86 billion, or 150% of its gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cWe refuse what\u2019s happening in Lebanon... The failure of our government to do at least the minimum ... has given us no other choice than to take the streets,\u201d said writer and director Lucien Bourjeily.\n\n\u201cThey are putting more and more taxes on us even though we can\u2019t take any more taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the motorcade of Education Minister Akram Chehayeb padded through downtown Beirut, protesters punched and kicked the cars. One bodyguard jumped out of an SUV and fired an automatic rifle into the air. Chehayeb rushed out of his car and pushed the guard away and prevented him from shooting again. No one was hurt in the incident.\n\nProtesters also closed roads in other parts of Lebanon, including the northern city of Tripoli, Tyre in the south and Baalbek in the northeast.\n\nThe government is discussing the 2020 budget, and new taxes have been proposed, including on tobacco, gasoline and some social media telecommunication software such as WhatsApp.\n\nTelecommunications Minister Mohamed Choucair appeared on TV after the protests began and said Prime Minister Saad Hariri has asked him to drop the proposed tax on WhatsApp.\n\nAs protests continued, demonstrators clashed briefly with riot police outside the government headquarters, an Ottoman-era compound known as the Grand Serial.\n\n\u201cWe have no jobs, we have money and we have no future,\u201d one protester screamed.\n\nInternational donors have been demanding that Lebanon implement economic changes in order to get loans and grants pledged at the CEDRE economic conference in Paris in April 2018. International donors pledged $11 billion for Lebanon but they sought to ensure the money is well spent in the corruption-plagued country.\n\nDespite tens of billions of dollars spent since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon still has crumbling infrastructure including daily electricity cuts, trash piles in the streets and often sporadic, limited water supplies from the state-owned water company.\n\nThere are concerns over the country\u2019s financial stability as well. Earlier this month, the local currency reached 1,650 Lebanese pounds to the dollar at exchange shops after it had been stable at 1,500 since 1997.", "description": "Lebanese security forces fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters in Beirut early Friday after they tried to push through security barriers around...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT572_beirut_ZG_20191017205718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
