REUTERS/Eric Vidal\n\nProtests over an end to fuel subsidies have erupted across the country, prompting President Lenin Moreno to accuse Correa, his predecessor and one-time mentor, of trying to overthrow him with help from Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\u201cThey are such liars ... They say I am so powerful that with an iPhone from Brussels I could lead the protests,\u201d he told Reuters, holding up his mobile telephone. \u201cPeople couldn\u2019t take it anymore, that\u2019s the reality,\u201d he said, referring to austerity measures brought in by Moreno with support from the IMF.\n\nMoreno has abandoned the leftist policies of Correa\u2019s time as president from 2007 to 2017, a rare period of stability for a country accustomed to political turmoil but which ended in corruption allegations and a rise in Ecuador\u2019s external debt.\n\nThousands of indigenous protesters have marched into the capital for a sixth day after Moreno announced a measure to eliminate fuel subsidies to reduce the fiscal deficit. A national strike is planned for Wednesday.\n\nIn a defiant national television address on Monday evening, Moreno, who has left the capital Quito, said he would not back down on the fuel price hike in the face of what he called a \u201cdestabilization plan\u201d orchestrated by Correa and Maduro.\n\nCorrea, who lives with his wife in a small town south of Brussels, has fiercely criticized Moreno, including with a video circulating on social media where he sings \u201cEcuadoreans, to the streets ... Goodbye, Lenin!\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that view on Tuesday, saying that \u201cthe government has already fallen\u201d and that he did not expect Moreno, who is in the southern port city of Guayaquil, to be able to return to Quito to govern while the protests continue.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they announce early elections,\u201d he said, calling on Ecuadoreans to exercise the right to resist what he called government oppression.\n\nSitting in an empty office with an Ecuadorean flag and his official photograph as president, Correa said he would be ready to return, possibly as a candidate for vice president, if new elections were called.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, I will go back. I would have to be a candidate for something, for example, vice president,\u201d said Correa, who said he earns a living in Brussels partly consulting for the Venezuela government and interviews for Russia\u2019s RT channel, which is backed by the Russian state.\n\n\u201cFrom there, we would need a constituent assembly,\u201d he said, although he declined to give details about any future government policies. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my plan, I am obliged to do this.\u201d\n\nMULTIPLE CORRUPTION CHARGES\n\nHe denied any direct links to Venezuela\u2019s Maduro, who France, the United States and several Latin American nations accuse of installing a dictatorship as a political and economic crisis deepens in Venezuela.\n\nBut he also accused the United States and the European Union of hypocrisy for imposing economic sanctions on the Maduro government, which stands accused of rights abuses.\n\n\u201cThey have a criminal blockade (against Venezuela). They must lift it.\u201d\n\nCorrea, who said he was working on five different books, defended his decision to live in his wife\u2019s native Belgium after leaving office in 2017. He said that it was right that after 26 years living as a couple in Ecuador, they spend time in Belgium.\n\nBut he also acknowledged he faced 29 different charges against him, from corruption to misuse of power, in Ecuador, and that he would not go back unless the political situation changed because he said he would not be given a fair hearing.\n\n\u201cI have to prepare my legal case. They have asked Interpol to raise a red alert and capture me, I had to hire a lawyer ... it is an enormous task. In the last few years, I\u2019ve worked just to pay lawyers.\u201d", "description": "Ecuador's former president Rafael Correa denied on Tuesday he was orchestrating a coup against the government from his self-imposed exile in Belgium, after being accused of stoking the worst unrest in years in the Andean oil producer.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438486481&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970XN", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
