In the memoir, written for HarperCollins, Moore reportedly addresses everything from her \u201ctumultuous relationship\u201d with her mother to her three marriages \u2014 to Freddy Moore, Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\u201cThere is a part of this that is like giving birth and I\u2019m like \u2018It\u2019s done. So, whatever it\u2019ll be.\u2019 I\u2019m just excited and open for the journey,\u201d she said.\n\nBut in her latest film, \u201cCoporate Animals,\u201d Moore goes on a different kind of journey, playing arrogant Incredible Edibles CEO Lucy. When her team heads off on a corporate team building retreat, things take a turn when the group rapels down into a cave to explore it and gets sealed in. Because the rest of the cast was assembled when Moore stepped into the lead role \u2014 replacing another actress \u2014 she suggested the group tackle some team building activities of their own off-set. First up, meeting Hindu spiritual leader Amma, who has hugged millions of people worldwide.\n\n\u201cI think that was the most surprising experience stepping in,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know everybody. Another actress was originally going to do this and got ill and then I stepped in. So, I was really behind the curve. And the fact that everyone jumped in and was game with the first event, which was actually going in and meeting Amma, the hugging saint, was awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody came. I thought for sure somebody would go, ah no, but everybody came,\u201d she continued, with a laugh. \u201cIt was awesome, and we really chose to spend all of our time off together. We\u2019re still on a text thread that we all connect on.\u201d\n\nDan Bakkedahl (who plays Moore\u2019s employee Billy) echoed those sentiments, saying the best part of filming was getting to know Moore and participating in those activities. \u201cShe was incredible. Really. She couldn\u2019t have been more personable and friendly,\u201d he told Variety. \u201cWe all had lunch together and dinner together. We went to a meditation retreat, like all sorts of just crazy team building stuff. She\u2019s a real team player. So there was team building out like in real life. She was like, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re all in here together. Let\u2019s get to know each other and appreciate one another.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the camaraderie continued after shooting wrapped. \u201cWhen we got back\u2026we all went to her house for lunch one day. There was no occasion. It was just \u2018Come to my house and let\u2019s have lunch.\u2019 It was great.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorporate Animals\u201d is in theaters on Friday.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
