When contacted by the Crimson and other news outlets, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Michael McCarthy offered only the following vague explanation for Ajjawi\u2019s deportation: \u201cThis individual was deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection.\u201d\n\nAmid the ongoing waves of heartbreaking deportation stories made public in the past two years, Ajjawi\u2019s story stands out for several reasons\u2014the fact of Ajjawi being a Harvard-admitted student chief among them.\n\nMatt Segal, legal director at the ACLU of Massachusetts, pointed to the beliefs underpinning Trump\u2019s chilling anti-immigrant rhetoric. \u201cThis story, if accurate, would confirm our worst fears about current immigration policy and border searches: that they will be used not to improve America\u2019s security, but instead to impose Trump\u2019s ideology,\u201d Segal wrote in a statement to TNR.\n\nSarang Sekhavat, the Federal Policy Director at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA) echoed the ACLU\u2019s sentiments. \u201cThat this happened to Mr. Ajjawi is deeply disappointing but not surprising and is a natural extension of the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies that President Trump has espoused since the launch of his campaign,\u201d Sekhavat wrote in a statement. \u201cBoston has many world-renowned educational institutions that not only provide a first class education to people from all over the world, but also serve as a form of soft power to increase our nation\u2019s standing and reputation in parts of the world that would otherwise have little contact with all that the US has to offer. The actions taken by this administration and amplified by individual officials without oversight create a chilling-effect on those who would otherwise seek out American institutions to further their education and pose a significant threat to global development and American standing.\u201d\n\nAs pointed out by both MIRA and the ACLU, Ajjawi\u2019s case represents the collision of a number of federal immigration policies, not all of which can be directly pinned on Trump\u2019s executive actions and racist rhetoric. The idea that immigration officials were able to stop Ajjawi, comb through his personal electronics\u2014the Crimson story infers he provided them permission\u2014and deport him because of messages he never posted himself is straight out of the Patriot Act playbook. And in some respects, President Barack Obama and the prior enabling Congresses must share some of the blame, as well. Still, there exists a sense of dark irony and disconnect between Trump\u2019s core message of \u201cThey\u2019re not sending their best\u201d and Ajjawi\u2019s story.", "description": "Trump's anti-immigration policies were introduced with talk of \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" but that was just a pretext to come after the rest.", "authors": ["Nick Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/599f5d59eb5c9c9b907d7b01bb08be52203cfed3.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
