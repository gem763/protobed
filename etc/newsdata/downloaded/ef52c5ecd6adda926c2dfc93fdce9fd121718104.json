a non-alcoholic drink popular in the Middle East - sit on a table next to cans of juice.\n\nSupplies including mugs and water bottles are strewn across tables and floors and one message on a whiteboard reads: 'Clean up after yourself... lazy!'.\n\nIn another part of the camp there is what appears to be a takeaway menu, with chicken dishes, kebabs and a kind of pizza on offer for six dollars each.\n\nAt one point the cameraman holds up a Bible labelled 'Military Challenge Edition' with the name of an infantry regiment on the front.\n\nLeft behind: Drinks bottles, plastic bags and a microwave and fridge have been abandoned by U.S. forces in this tent after they left for the Iraqi border\n\nShelter: Two chairs sit in the doorway of a small building next to a tent at the base in northern Syria where U.S. forces had been deployed\n\nThere is also a laundry room with two neat rows of washing machines, one of which is apparently broken.\n\nSatellite dishes, a large TV inside a tent and a pile of DVDs indicate a connection to the outside world, but the soldiers there were warned to be careful.\n\n'Phones and WiFi are not secure - do not disclose operational information, pictures or locations,' one printed note reads.\n\nAmerican troops were ordered out of Syria on October 6 in what Donald Trump says was a mission to bring U.S. forces home from 'endless wars' in the Middle East.\n\nSince then, Syrian and Russian forces have already entered the town of Manbij.\n\nTrump's decision has turned the international spotlight on Syria once again after Turkey used the opportunity to launch an offensive against Kurdish fighters.\n\nThe U.S. has indicated that some of its withdrawn troops may stay in western Iraq to continue the fight against ISIS.\n\nBut Iraq appeared to throw those plans into disarray yesterday by saying the Americans had no permission to stay there.\n\nDebris: A mess has been left on this table, with items of rubbish on the tabletop and several office chairs around the side\n\nAccommodation: These appear to be the some military living quarters at the Syrian camp, with beds arranged in two rows in a tent\n\nAmerican forces have permission from the Kurdish regional government to transit through Iraq but have no approval to stay there, a statement said yesterday.\n\nU.S. forces have withdrawn from several bases in Syria, including from the key town of Manbij and another close to Kobane close to the Turkish border.\n\nThere is a U.S. base in the autonomous region and a withdrawing convoy crossed the Tigris River at a border post on Monday.\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked U.S. troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq after Washington pulled the plug on their support.\n\nAmerican troops were even pelted with potatoes as they passed through a Syrian town on their way to Iraq on Monday.\n\nA US military vehicle flying the Kurdish flag can be seen arriving in Iraqi Kurdistan after its withdrawal from northern Syria\n\nThis map shows where American forces are crossing into Iraq after Donald Trump ordered them out of Syria - opening the way to Turkey's operation in northern Syria\n\nFootage posted to Twitter showed a vehicle bearing the American flag struggling to make its way forward as several locals stand in front of it.\n\nThe Pentagon is now considering keeping a small U.S. force in north-eastern Syria to protect oilfields.\n\nThe United States currently has 5,200 troops posted in Iraq, deployed as part of a Washington-led coalition against the ISIS jihadists.\n\nThe U.S. presence at several bases across Iraq is already controversial, with numerous political groups and pro-Iran Shiite armed groups demanding their expulsion.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters in Syria are dominated by the YPG, a militia which Turkey regards as a terrorist group.\n\nSince the Turkish offensive began on October 9, at least 114 civilians have been killed and some 300,000 people have been displaced.", "description": "The camp near Manbij in northern Syria was equipped with armchairs, fridges and satellite dishes, as well as books and a collection of DVDs and video games, all of which were left behind.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20081952-0-image-a-16_1571831842336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
