I had to face a police interview, I believed I was about to lose my job, I was told I'd been charged ... I was just hit with an AVO, I admitted to my wife I'd had an affair,\" Mr Clements said.\n\nMr Huang also provided an unnamed right-wing union with $10,000 in cash to help them avoid \"an election challenge\".\n\nMr Clements thought Mr Huang wanted \"friendship (and) proximity to power\" from his relationship with him and other political figures.\n\nHe revealed former NSW Labor upper house MP Ernest Wong contacted him in July 2017 and the pair then met at a Starbucks in Chinatown.\n\n\"At the end of the conversation, he told me there was an investigation from the Electoral Commission and it was alleged I had been handed an Audi bag, he said Aldi I understand now, by Mr Huang,\" Mr Clements said.\n\n\"He said 'Your name has come up ... because (NSW Labor community relations director) Kenrick Cheah has said Mr Huang attended your office, gave you an Audi bag full of cash' - obviously he said Aldi - 'you took the bag, gave it to Kenrick and said, count it.\"\n\nMr Clements claimed he replied: \"Why the f*** would Kenrick say that?\" and strongly denied Mr Cheah's version of events.", "description": "Former NSW Labor general secretary Jamie Clements has resumed giving evidence at an anti-corruption inquiry after admitting Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
