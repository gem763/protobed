The subpoenas came hours after the two men were arrested for campaign finance violations.\n\nThree House committees subpoenaed Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman for documents they have so far refused to provide. The panels have also subpoenaed Giuliani.\n\nParnas and Fruman were involved in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to urge Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden and his family. That effort was also discussed by Trump in a July call with Ukraine\u2019s president and is at the heart of the impeachment probe.\n\nThe men were arrested on a four-count indictment, including charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records.", "description": "The subpoenas came just hours after the two men were arrested for campaign finance violations.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ392_giulia_ZG_20190512160832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
