On Friday, before the attack cut Saudi oil production by half, CEF data was indicating a drop of 11 cents for 95 octane and 25 cents for 93 octane petrol.\n\nIt expects the price of diesel to increase by 13 cents a litre.\n\nThe AA added that more changes were likely before month-end, saying the drone strikes had made forecasting the international oil price more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "An attack on a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia means that a predicted drop in the petrol price for October will be lower than anticipated based on mid-month data, according to the Automobile Association.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8131/cd2710b18ac947c2b677b4f110b9177e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
