Being impartial, I\u2019m making this decision on who I believe the public would like to see through to next week.\n\n\"Based on that reason the person I\u2019m sending home is, unfortunately, Olivia.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nFurious X Factor viewers took to Twitter after the controversial result was announced.\n\nOne viewer said: \"IS HE SERIOUS?! This show we\u2019ve heard before but is more likely now to be a fix, especially now with agents of these celebrities involved.\"\n\n\"What the HELL?! Olivia was amazing she should not be going home first..I\u2019m sorry but what was Simon thinking???,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Can't blame Olivia for being in tears really I would be aswel if I got sent home over a guy who can't even hold a note\"\n\n\"What a load of rubbish so you finish off the best singers and let the worse one remain .... fix or what!,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEven saved celebrity Martin admitted that Olivia was a much better singer than him.\n\nOn whether he expected to be saved, he said: \"I didn\u2019t and Olivia is a wonderful vocalist. 10 times what I am. It's really tough. We knew when we came into this it was going to be hard.\"\n\nRicki was given the boot straight away after failing to impress the voting public at home.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGiving her reaction, she said: \"I guess I have to stick to my day job. It's been such an amazing experience. So surreal for me.\n\n\"And to be embraced by this audience, who grew up with me, Louis who are up with me, I love that he said that.\n\n\"It's been an amazing experience and thank you for welcoming me.\"\n\n*The X Factor: Celebrity airs Saturday on ITV at 8.20pm", "description": "X Factor: Celebrity viewers are outraged after Simon Cowell went home the Love Actually star over Martin Bashir", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733569.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-X-Factor-Olivia-leaves.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
