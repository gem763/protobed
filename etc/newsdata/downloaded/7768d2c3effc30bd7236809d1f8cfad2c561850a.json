Metropolitan Court, pleading no contest to disorderly conduct for the incident that took place in April.\n\nAccording to ESPN, which cited court documents, Jones received a 90-day deferred sentence, during which time he must avoid legal trouble and can\u2019t consume alcohol or drugs. Jones also is under unsupervised probation, can\u2019t return to the strip club and must pay court fees. His no contest plea isn\u2019t considered admission of guilt in the state of New Mexico.\n\nJones, 32, originally pleaded not guilty to a charge of battery after being accused of roughhousing with the alleged victim and then slapping on her vagina during a visit to TD\u2019s Eubank Showclub in April.\n\nAlbuquerque police were called to the alleged victim\u2019s house on April 19 and spoke to her about what transpired. CBS Albuquerque affiliate KRQE obtained bodycam footage from the responding officers who took her statement, which led to a warrant being issued for Jones\u2019 arrest.\n\nJones didn\u2019t become aware of his arrest until July. At the time, Jones downplayed the situation on Twitter, claiming he was \u201cdefinitely not in any trouble.\u201d\n\nSince returning from his most recent U.S. Anti-Doping Agency suspension last year, Jones has fought three times in the past nine months. He won the vacant UFC light heavyweight title last December in a rematch with Alexander Gustafsson, and has since defended his belt twice this year with wins over Anthony Smith and Thiago Santos.\n\nJones had expressed his desire to fight once more before 2019 ended, but that appears unlikely.", "description": "Jon Jones pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct after a cocktail waitress claimed he slapped her vagina in April.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/jon-jones-post-ufc-235-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
