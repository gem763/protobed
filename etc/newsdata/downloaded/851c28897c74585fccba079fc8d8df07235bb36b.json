Stay on the A40 for another hour, however, and you\u2019ll find yourself in an uncrowded and utterly enchanting alternative.\n\nYou won\u2019t find Instagrammers, selfie sticks, Jeremy Clarkson or a branch of Soho House in the Forest of Dean. Instead it offers simple pleasures: cosy cabins without Wi-Fi, hearty food in unfussy pubs, and long walks through ancient woodland \u2013 with the chance of spotting skittish deer and even wild boar.\n\nWild boar in England?\n\nThe Forest of Dean has become something of a rewilding trailblazer. Last month 18 pine martens were released at a secret location in the forest, and the cute porkers \u2013 hunted to extinction across the UK in the 13th century \u2013 reestablished themselves in the region around 20 years ago. Today it has Britain\u2019s largest wild boar population (around 1,500), giving walkers a fair chance of a sighting.", "description": "", "authors": ["Oliver Smith", "Digital Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/forest-yat-luke-stackpoole-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
