Shares surged more than 30% and have outpaced the broader market\u2019s 21% gain in the same time period. Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect VF Corp to report adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share on $3.42 billion of revenue during its second quarter.\n\nShoes and backpack of Vans are seen in a shop window in Sao Paulo, Brazil. REUTERS/Rahel Patrasso More\n\nOne thing that analysts are watching for when VF Corp reports earnings is how the company fared during the later-than-normal start to back-to-school season this year. The late start likely led to muted demand for the retailer, specifically its Vans brand. VF Corp\u2019s Vans and The North Face brands have been the strongest performers over recent quarters.\n\nSecond-quarter financial results follow a blowout first quarter for VF Corp. The stock surged and hit all-time highs after a beat and raise quarter for the company. During the first quarter, both Vans and The North Face grew by double digits internationally and in China. Margins also expanded by 120 basis points during VF Corp\u2019s Q1. The North Face sales grew 24% in the U.S. Following first-quarter results, CEO Steven Rendle said that the American consumer was pretty healthy and said that the company had a lot of confidence in the higher fiscal-year targets.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahoo Finance\u2019s parent company, Verizon, will also be releasing third-quarter results. Verizon\u2019s wireless revenue is expected to have grown 2% during the most recent quarter. Analysts are expecting that postpaid average revenue per user rose 0.3% during Q3, even despite the price cuts on unlimited plans. Verizon is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share on $32.75 billion, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. 5G won\u2019t be factored into Verizon\u2019s sales growth for a while, but the conference call is likely to focus on 5G.\n\nVerizon shares are up a modest 12% this year and have underperformed its peers. The Communications Services sector ETF, XLC, rose 21% in the same time period.\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
