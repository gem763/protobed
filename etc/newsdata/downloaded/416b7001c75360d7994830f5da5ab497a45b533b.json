He also points out the success of the sport in television ratings and an increase in minor league gates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to draw 68-plus million people at the big league level,\u201d Manfred said, \u201canother 41 million in minor league baseball \u2014 they\u2019re actually going to be up. I\u2019ll take 110 million people going to see the sport live. That\u2019s a really, really awesome number in an environment where people have more and more and more alternatives to consume.\u201d\n\nWhat team drew the most fans this season?
