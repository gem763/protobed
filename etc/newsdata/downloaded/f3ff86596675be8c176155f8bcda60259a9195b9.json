The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) indicates that staying in a customs union leaves the nation \u00a370bn worse off or \u00a3700 per person per year by 2030.\n\nWhile the Tories may claim the end of austerity, Labour MPs know that the country is on its knees. For many families in deprived areas, such as Bolton, Crewe or Gateshead, \u00a3700 is the difference between heating and eating.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The Customs Union isn\u2019t a good outcome, but it\u2019s better for the people of this country than a last-minute scrapping of the deal in favour of fantasy. Boris Johnson either doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t care, that you can\u2019t have an implementation period without a deal. He either doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t care, that he said leaving without a deal was \u201cinsane\u201d, but now advocates for that outcome.\n\nHe does know, but doesn\u2019t care (or admit), that he made false claims in 2016 about the likelihood of Turkey joining the EU.\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has traded on his inability to manage his own hair, let alone a country. But in the beauty contest of a Tory leadership election, where a privileged few compete for the approval of a right-wing selectorate, he\u2019s odds-on to win. Faced with 100,000 Tory members, the path to victory will be whoever can offer the boldest pledges for a hard Brexit. There will be every incentive for these budding leaders to distance themselves from Theresa May and her deal; and no incentive to signal a willingness to compromise.\n\nHis fans speak for themselves. Steve Bannon praises him in the same breath as Tommy Robinson. Donald Trump thinks he has the \u201cright attitude\u201d to be prime minister. Dominic Raab has called Johnson a \u201cnatural born winner\u201d.\n\nOn the face of it, it\u2019s good that Brexit is now being treated as an issue that requires compromise. For too long, the prime minister has played a losing game of \"her way or the highway\". But Labour shouldn\u2019t forget that these are desperate times for the Tory party and it will do anything to survive.\n\nConference policy, as an expression of the wishes of Labour members like me, must remain a red line. If people opt to leave on a compromise deal after a confirmatory referendum, it would be an unwise politician who chooses to go against that mandate. Even Boris Johnson will find it impossible, having spent years talking about the will of the people.\n\nBy supporting a final say on Brexit, Labour keeps the support of young people. It gives the British public the ability to choose their own future. It allows every person in the UK to have their say on the direction their country is going in. The country wants it. Nine out of ten Labour MPs have voted for it. Nine out of ten constituencies now back it. And 72% of the membership is in favour.\n\nCorbyn is the leader that brought democracy back to the party. He must now bring Brexit back to the people.\n\nCathleen Clark is a campaign coordinator at Our Future, Our Choice, and a member of Momentum.", "description": "I never thought, as a member of Momentum, that I would be helping to launch a Boris Johnson leadership campaign.
