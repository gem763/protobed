If Netflix had a reason to permanently change their business model, they would. They have the data that shows this is what consumers want.\u201d\n\nNow, the world\u2019s leading streaming service, with 60 million U.S. subscribers and a total of 139 million subscribers worldwide, is temporarily shifting their business model for the network\u2019s upcoming reality show, a hip-hop competition titled \u201cRhythm + Flow.\u201d Netflix\u2019s will present the series by breaking it up into three batches, which will air over the course of three weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix\u2019s rival Amazon has streamed live events like the NFL while Hulu has not always utilized the binge approach either.\n\nHulu uses a weekly approach, where several episodes are made available to start, with the remainder of the season spaced out weekly. Disney and Apple\u2019s upcoming streaming services are reportedly set to follow that same model.\n\nNetflix says this is a one-off move due to the nature of the competition programs which rely on secrecy as contestants are whittled down to determine the winner of the show.\n\nNetflix\u2019s original content shows like \u201cOrange is the New Black\" and \u201cStranger Things\u201d have proven to be massive successes for the streaming service using the all-at-once distribution system. Said Rayburn, \u201cNetflix knows what\u2019s best for their business,\" he said. \u201cThey have a responsibility to shareholders and consumers alike so that the business can survive. If the binge-watching model did that much damage to their bottom line, they would change it.\u201d\n\nThe entertainment business has traditionally been the victim of business has fluctuations. \"It\u2019s not the first time Netflix hasn\u2019t reached a goal in a quarter, and people will point to their competition. \u2018Oh, their competitors are eating away at Netflix,' yet Disney and Apple\u2019s streaming services haven\u2019t even launched yet,\u201d said Rayburn.\n\nDisney and Apple will be entering the steaming service market beginning in November, and HBO Max set to launch in spring of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile. Netflix's \"Rhythm + Flow is set to debut on Oct. 9, with the likes of Cardi B, Chance the Rapper and T.I. to serve as judges for the competition.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Netflix's business model has always relied on \"binge-watching\" distribution, but a new hip hop competition reality show will break that mold and air over the course of several weeks.
