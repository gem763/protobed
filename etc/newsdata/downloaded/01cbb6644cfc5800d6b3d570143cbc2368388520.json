Frank Knight ranks ultra-high net worth individuals as those worth more than $US30 million. It predicts the Australian cohort will grow by a whopping 20%, and it is real estate which will drive the boost.\n\nThat\u2019s because on average the super-rich own three residential properties each, with more than a third of their wealth derived from it, according to Frank Knight. One in six will buy another one by the year\u2019s end, with the price of these luxury properties to grow 2% by the end of the year, and 3% in 2020.\n\nBased partly on that property growth, it also projects that in five years, there will be 3,675 Australians who fit the bill of ultra-high net worth. By its estimates, 1,054 will call Sydney home, while 626 live in Melbourne and 385 in Perth. Similarly, it estimates there will be a 14% increase in Australian billionaires, bring the national total to 49.\n\nUnless you\u2019re one of them, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be calling one a neighbour anytime soon. The exclusivity of the luxury market is helped by the fact that it\u2019s absurdly expensive to the average person.\n\nIn Sydney, $US1 million ($1.49 million) on average buys just 52 square metres of prime real estate, according to the report. That might be staggering but at least it\u2019s better than 31 square metres in New York and London and 46 in Paris.\n\nIt\u2019s of little comfort for those just trying to buy any sort of property.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
