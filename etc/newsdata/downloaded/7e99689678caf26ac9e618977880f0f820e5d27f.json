He was detained for seven months before Swiss authorities extradited him to face criminal charges in Uruguay rather than the United States. He was kept under house arrest in his home country.\n\nA U.S. Department of Justice indictment published in 2015 said Figueredo obtained American citizenship nine years earlier after having \u201cfalsely stated that he had severe dementia\u201d to avoid an English language test.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former FIFA vice president Eugenio Figueredo has been banned for life for bribery that was exposed by a sprawling American federal investigation of corruption in international soccer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
