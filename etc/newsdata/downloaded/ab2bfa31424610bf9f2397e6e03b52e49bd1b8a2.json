According to VW, the Beetle was the first era, the Golf was the second, and the electric ID lineup represents the third.\n\nMore two-dimensional than before, the new logo has a far simpler appearance. The overall shape with the stacked V and W remains, but the font and circular surround is different.\n\n\n\nVW says the new logo represents a \"friendlier\" attitude for the company. It will be accompanied by other changes to the marketing strategy, such as a woman's voice stating the brand name in a so-called \u201csound logo\u201d for the first time.\n\nThe logo will first appear on the ID. 3 electric car and will roll out to the rest of the VW lineup by mid-2020, VW said.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The ID.3 EV will get the \"friendlier\" new logo first, but other VWs will have it by mid-2020.", "authors": ["Joey Capparella"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7BMxbQsSjh119joBy47OmA--~B/aD02NDI7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/bf39666ab92366e312e5b7a85c6a9418", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
