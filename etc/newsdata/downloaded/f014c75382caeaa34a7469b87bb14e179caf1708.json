Here\u2019s what to do", "language": "en", "text": "Following my post on what to do if your watchOS update is stuck, I've been receiving questions about what to do when your iPhone is stuck trying to install iOS 13. Don't worry, there is a fix!\n\nCommon symptoms are when the update screen seems stuck on \"Estimated Time Remaining,\" \"Update Requested,\" or \"Verifying Update,\" or \"Preparing to Update.\"\n\nRead more: Call and battery problems plague iOS 13.1.2\n\nThere first \"fix\" is patience. Just wait.\n\nGo for a cup of tea or coffee, watch a movie, or just go for a walk (none of these things need an iPhone in hand to do\u2026 honestly!).\n\nMost of the time just waiting fixes these problems.\n\nAnother \"fix\" is to move to a spot with stronger Wi-Fi or cellular signal. This can be quite effective when the download just doesn't want to come in.\n\nNeither of those work?\n\nTime to get a bit more hands-on and delete the download and redownload it.\n\nGo to Settings > General > iPhone Storage (or iPad Storage) and find iOS 13 in the listing. Tap on it and select Delete Update, and then confirm the deletion.\n\nAfterwards, I recommend rebooting your device (reboot instructions here), and then go to Settings > General > Software Update to redownload the update.", "description": "iOS 13 update screen stuck on \u201cEstimated Time Remaining,\u201d \u201cUpdate Requested,\u201d or \u201cVerifying Update,\u201d or \u201cPreparing to Update\u201d?
