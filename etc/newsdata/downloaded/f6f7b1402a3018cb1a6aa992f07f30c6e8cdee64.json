Gray zone activities are an astute object for concept development, as they \u201ccreep up on their goals gradually,\u201d rather than involving decisive moves, as Michael Mazarr has argued. In response, Mazarr contends, gray zone operations will \u201ccall for a greater emphasis on innovation\u201d as these operations take different forms and intensities and thus require varied responses. This coincides with the general need to devote more attention to concepts development that drives the use of new naval technologies such as unmanned systems.\n\nApplying Unmanned Systems to Gulf Security\n\nMaritime stability in the Arabian Sea has deteriorated significantly over the past couple of weeks. In response to the Iranian seizure of the Stena Imperio, a Swedish oil tanker under British flag, London reached out to different European capitals in view of establishing a maritime protection mission escorting commercial vessels through the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Unmanned systems could counter Iran's aggression.", "authors": ["Heiko Borchert"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qhJW2Dfna0sAcVaSdnCsrA--~B/aD05Njk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/2f46c727cb28b373a7fe0534d4d811e8", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
