But Yahoo Finance calculated that his plan could cost $863 billion, just shy of the U.S. Social Security Administration\u2019s annual budget. Dispersed over a decade, it could amount to $86.3 billion per year \u2014 about 60% more than the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) $52.7 billion 2019 budget (Annualized Continuing Resolution), not to mention other expenses for the department. And a $33.6 billion budget increase seems unlikely, as the 2020 HUD budget proposal came in at $44.1 billion in March \u2014 well below HUD\u2019s current budget.\n\nBennet, who is a ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure as part of his term on the Senate\u2019s Committee on Finance, said under his plan 4 million affordable housing units would be created, preserved or refurbished in the U.S. via government funding.\n\nAssuming all the units are refurbished instead of built from the ground up \u2014 new construction would double the cost \u2014 this piece of the plan would cost $324 billion, at $81,000 per unit, according to HUD estimates. The person familiar with Bennet\u2019s campaign said that costs is inflated and that the preservation of units costs just a few thousand dollars per unit.\n\n\u201cMichael's plan is a comprehensive approach to both building more affordable homes and helping families access them, and it will be paid for by reexamining tax policies that currently subsidize high-income homeowners at the expense of people living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d a campaign spokesperson said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

On top of that, he calls for about $40.6 billion in incentives to fund housing innovation ideas like a competitive grant to reduce exclusionary housing, a grant competition for homebuilders to rethink \u201cradically low-cost housing,\u201d Capital Magnet Fund grants and a pilot program to create housing budgets.\n\nBennet\u2019s plan also calls for $20 billion to revitalize downtown areas over 10 years and an ambitious $7.5 billion per year program to \u201cend all forms of\u201d homelessness by 2028.\n\n\"A home is a platform for stability and upward mobility in America, but for too many families, owning a home is out of reach and the high cost of paying rent has pushed them to a breaking point,\" said Bennet in an emailed statement. \"As a former superintendent, I know how important it is for kids to have a stable home so they can show up to school ready to learn and succeed. Slogans like national rent control won\u2019t solve the problem. We need to build more homes near good jobs and good schools and ensure people can actually afford them. That\u2019s the bottom line for creating opportunity for all Americans.\"\n\nSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
