He was looking for \"extremely talented\" software developers to \"help pioneer commerce on the internet.\"\n\n\n\nThe entrepreneur in question was Jeff Bezos, who was taking his first steps toward building Amazon. Bezos is now the wealthiest man in modern history, and Amazon has grown into such a dominant force that the Federal Trade Commission has started questioning its rivals about whether they feel crushed by the company.\n\nBezos nostalgically posted an image of the job ad on Instagram on Friday, saying it \"felt like yesterday.\"\n\nHere's the text of the job ad:\n\nWell-capitalised start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet. You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible. You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent. Top-notch communication skills are essential. Familiarity with web servers and HTML would be helpful but is not necessary. Expect talented, motivated, intense, and interesting co-workers. Must be willing to relocate to the Seattle area (we will help cover moving costs). Your compensation will include meaningful equity ownership.
