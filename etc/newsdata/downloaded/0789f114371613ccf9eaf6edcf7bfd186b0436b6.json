After years of reading almost exclusively men, I\u2019m now addicted to sharp female writers like Levy who write about what it is to be a woman. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever tire of the excitement of recognising how I see the world in a book.\n\nThe book that changed my life\n\nWhere There\u2019s a Will There\u2019s a Way or, All I Really Need to Know I Learned from Shakespeare by Laurie Maguire. Part literary analysis, part self-help book, reading this made me realise I was in an abusive relationship \u2013 which was the first step to getting out.\n\nThe book I wish I\u2019d written\n\nThis is cheating a bit as it\u2019s not out yet, but Helen Lewis\u2019s forthcoming Difficult Women. I always love her writing \u2013 an enviable mix of effortlessly erudite and funny \u2013 and this book addresses one of the great unacknowledged blocks to female liberation: the tyranny of niceness. No one ever changed the world by being nice.\n\nThe book that had the greatest influence on me\n\nI\u2019m going to choose a writer rather than a book: Cordelia Fine. Reading Delusions of Gender and Testosterone Rex made me feel that science writing could be fun, accessible and have a sense of humour. And, crucially, that it could be about women.\n\nThe book I think is most underrated\n\nI\u2019m not sure how underrated it is, but it definitely isn\u2019t read enough any more: A Literature of Their Own by Elaine Showalter. If nothing else it\u2019s worth reading for a look at the reviews of George Eliot\u2019s books before \u2013 and after \u2013 critics knew she was a woman.\n\nThe book that changed my mind\n\nFeminism and Linguistic Theory by Deborah Cameron. I didn\u2019t grow up a feminist. In fact I thought feminism was stupid and feminists were embarrassing. This book changed all that.\n\nThe last book that made me cry\n\nLike all Margaret Atwood\u2019s novels, The Blind Assassin breaks your heart through a thousand acute observations of the female experience. Specifically in this novel, the tragedy of how women\u2019s lives are disfigured by male violence.\n\nThe last book that made me laugh\n\nDon\u2019t Hold My Head Down by Lucy-Anne Holmes. A hilarious, poignant and much-needed book about sex. I can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed out loud so much reading a book. Every young woman (and man) should read it.\n\nThe book I couldn\u2019t finish\n\nUlysses by James Joyce. I don\u2019t feel I need to explain myself.\n\nThe book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read\n\nThere\u2019s no point feeling ashamed of unread books. There are so many brilliant books, you could never hope to read them all. So just take pleasure in the books you have had time to read. That said, the teetering to-read pile in my bedroom does make me feel guilty every day.\n\nThe book I give as a gift\n\nThe Wife by Meg Wolitzer. Hard to talk about it without giving away the plot, but this. It is one for all those wives who were thanked in the acknowledgments of their great husband\u2019s great works\u2026\n\nThe book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for\n\nThis seems a little premature given I\u2019ve only written two books, but I suppose Invisible Women is the one I\u2019m most proud of. I hope it effects the change women so desperately need.\n\nMy earliest reading memory\n\nI can\u2019t remember a time when I wasn\u2019t reading. I was definitely one of those head-in-a-book kids. I remember reading Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles when I was far too young to understand what was going on. I think I thought it was just a tragic love story (to be fair I think Hardy probably thought that too).\n\nMy comfort read\n\nWhen I want to read a book that is like getting into a warm bath I invariably reach for Nancy Mitford\u2019s The Pursuit of Love, and cheer Linda on as she muddles her way through life, love and a series of terrible men.\n\n\u2022 Invisible Women (Chatto & Windus) won the 2019 Royal Society science book prize this week.", "description": "The journalist and campaigner on the book that made her realise she was in an abusive relationship and the comforts of Nancy Mitford", "authors": ["Caroline Criado Perez"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54062ddd30a919f77226a45748e5fd59e4972d00/0_598_2329_1397/master/2329.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e891a50bced7f0e5440cf17d6b26a9d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
