Or, as Zach Galifianakis puts it, \u201cHow do you beat a dead horse properly?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween Two Ferns: The Movie,\u201d premiering on Netflix Friday, brings back the celebrity-interview spoof that racked up millions of views since the first of its 22 episodes hit the internet in 2008.\n\nThe film is a mockumentary about \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis,\u201d an Emmy award-winning video series for the website Funny or Die. Mr. Galifianakis reprises his role as a public-access TV show host who asks famous people obnoxious questions.\n\nIn the movie Mr. Galifianakis spars with actual Funny or Die co-founder Will Ferrell, who tells the actor that if he interviews 10 celebrities in two weeks he will get his own network talk show. Eager to be taken seriously, Mr. Galifianakis embarks on a road trip with his crew in search of Hollywood stars while a filmmaker documents their quest.\n\nActors in the film and the show don\u2019t get questions ahead of time, said Mr. Galifianakis and the movie\u2019s director, Scott Aukerman. The humor relies on the guests\u2019 real-time reactions and the audience\u2019s uncertainty about what those A-listers are actually thinking.\n\n\u201cThere have been a couple of times where we found out later that they were annoyed,\u201d Mr. Aukerman said of past guests. \u201cSometimes people just get put onto publicity things and they arrive thinking it\u2019s a real interview.\u201d\n\nOver the 88-minute movie, Mr. Galifianakis assumes the pose of a self-serious journalist. To Matthew McConaughey : \u201cI notice that you\u2019re wearing a shirt. Is everything OK?\u201d To Brie Larson: \u201cI read online that you\u2019re very private and decline to answer questions that make you feel uncomfortable. Is that true and how old were you when you got your first period?\u201d To Jon Hamm: \u201c Bradley Cooper directed, co-wrote and starred in \u2018A Star is Born.\u2019 Are you hoping that will open doors for other hot idiots?\u201d\n\nThe 49-year-old actor who broke out in the 2009 hit \u201cThe Hangover\u201d said he probably will retire the web series after the movie. The show drew headlines with appearances by President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Galifianakis, whose comedy \u201cBaskets\u201d about the travails of a rodeo clown just wrapped up its fourth and final season on FX, recently reflected on the fawning nature of celebrity coverage, the times he can\u2019t keep a straight face and the \u201cFerns\u201d interview that still baffles him. Here, an edited transcript:\n\nWhat do you think of entertainment news?\n\nThe celebrity culture called Hollywood\u2014there\u2019s no culture in it. There\u2019s nothing really to grab onto except rich, privileged people on yachts photographing themselves. People think Hollywood is just a giant playground. It\u2019s work. Every journalist thinks we\u2019re all pranking each other while we\u2019re working. Look man, I\u2019m almost 50, I don\u2019t prank. With \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d I think there was some kind of deep-seated want in me to capitalize on the humor that can be found in these caste systems that Hollywood has set up.\n\nHave any actors ever gotten insulted for real by your questions?\n\nThere was one where I went up to the director and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done with the interview,\u201d because I could sense some real animosity. But I may have misread it because I ended up going to dinner with that guest that night. I think that person was such a great actor that they fooled me.\n\nWho makes a better guest, a serious actor or a funny one?\n\nThe serious actor is really fertile ground. The more serious the person is, the better it is for me.\n\nIs it hard to insult you?\n\nWe write a lot of the insults for the guests to do to me. I don\u2019t think it would work if they didn\u2019t lob them back. I particularly don\u2019t mind being made fun of as long as it\u2019s clever and funny and not necessarily from a hurtful place.\n\nWhat\u2019s your strategy for keeping a straight face?\n\nSometimes I do break. Sometimes I can\u2019t get questions out because they\u2019re so mean or so ridiculous. Sometimes I\u2019m nervous and that helps. I don\u2019t know most of the people I interview. I always say, \u201cHey, if I say anything that is hurtful\u2014I do not want to hurt anyone.\u201d Even when I say that they\u2019re sometimes a little shocked at certain questions.\n\nWould you want to interview anyone from the 2020 presidential campaign?\n\nI would like the Truth to come on. Like, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of the term \u201cHollywood liberal\u201d?\n\nHollywood is liberal for the porno industry and in its haircuts, but everything else, it\u2019s not that liberal.\n\nHow has Hollywood changed over the years?\n\nThese days, people are being hired by their Twitter followers rather than their talent and that\u2019s somebody I don\u2019t want to work with. I once went to a reshoot of something a few years ago and there was a Bentley in the parking lot. I was like, \u201cWho\u2019s driving a Bentley around here?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, they cast some Instagram star because he has a lot of followers.\u201d And I looked him up and it\u2019s nothing but a guy with guns and boobs. I don\u2019t know if he ended up in the movie but that bro culture of Hollywood is alive and kicking.\n\nThat bro culture is associated with \u201cThe Hangover,\u201d but your character brought something different\u2014we empathized with him.\n\nListen, if you\u2019re going to play weird, you\u2019ve got to make them lovable.\n\nWrite to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com", "description": "The host of the Emmy-award winning fake talk show that\u2019s now a movie discusses the art of insulting big stars.", "authors": ["Ellen Gamerman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106985/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
