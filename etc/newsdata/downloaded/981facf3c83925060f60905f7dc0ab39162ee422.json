However, while the trend since May has been good, FY 19 still stands out as the highest number of apprehensions since 2007. From the Washington Examiner:\n\nBorder Patrol agents working along the United States-Mexico border took into custody approximately 851,000 people in the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal 2019, marking the highest number of arrests since 2007, according to federal data exclusively obtained by the Washington Examiner. But the 40,000 people taken into custody in September is less than one-third of the 132,000 arrests made in May at the height of a surge of illegal immigrants\u2026 The biggest change in fiscal 2019 compared to the Border Patrol\u2019s previous 95 years was the number of families who arrived. In 2015, fewer than 80,000 people who arrived with a family member were among those apprehended by the Border Patrol. As of Aug. 31, more than 450,000 people who arrived with a family member were taken into custody.\n\nThis is the fourth month in a row that the number of apprehensions have declined. CNN notes that the usual seasonal patters of migration have shifted in recent years:\n\nHistorically, apprehension numbers have risen in the spring and dropped in the fall and winter. However, in recent years, there have been severe lows and highs, not fitting into a seasonal pattern.\n\nIn FY15 and FY17, apprehensions were higher in September than in May. In FY 18 they were only slightly lower in September than the peak in May. All that to say, this substantial 65 percent decline was not at all a given. It\u2019s the result of an effort by the Trump administration to deal with a problem that at times threatened to overwhelm the border patrol.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, back in March when Kevin McAleenan was sounding the alarm in his testimony before Congress, Sen. Blumenthal was doing his best to discount there way any emergency at the border:\n\nDuring a Senate oversight hearing this month, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asserted that border crossings \u201care still at a historic low compared to other times in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cNo, senator, they\u2019re not,\u201d CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan responded. \u201cWe\u2019re on pace for over 700,000 crossings this year \u2014 that\u2019s closer to historic highs than historic lows.\u201d After Blumenthal suggested the numbers were a fluke, McAleenan said: \u201cWe have to confront what\u2019s happened in these five months. . . . This is new, different and potentially worsening.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip of this exchange below. You\u2019ll see that Blumenthal keeps arguing that the projection of 700,000 apprehensions in FY19 could be wrong. It turns out he was right about that. The estimate was 150,000 apprehensions too low.", "description": "\"...approximately 851,000 people in the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal 2019\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crossing-the-Rio-Grande.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
