The attacks cut daily world oil supply by 5%.\n\nsettled down $4.47, or 6.5%, at $64.55.\n\nBoth WTI and jumped more than 14% each in Monday\u2019s session.\n\nSaudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told a news conference in Riyadh that the kingdom will have the ability to produce 11 million barrels per day by Sept. 30 and 12 million bpd by end November, Bloomberg reported.\n\nSaudi Arabia produced 9.85 million bpd in August. The last time it produced as much as 11 million bpd was nearly a year ago, in November 2018.\n\nThe Abqaiq facility, which had 4.9 million bpd of output before the attacks, has also had about 2 million bpd restored, Nasir Ameen, chief executive of national oil company Saudi Aramco said, according to the report. Full production was expected to return by end of September.\n\nSome oil market participants were skeptical of the kingdom\u2019s assessment of its ability to rebound so strongly from the attacks, which Yemen-based Houthi rebels claim to have carried out using drones, while U.S. officials suspected projectiles fired by Iran.\n\nA few were of the opinion that the Saudi government was eager to give its oil industry a quick clean bill of health in order not to disrupt the impending IPO of Aramco.\n\n\u201cThe IPO is all-important to the Saudis and they can\u2019t let it sink now,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. \u201cAlso, this attack is a huge embarrassment for them and they need to put up a brave face against the Houthis and the Iranians.\u201d", "description": "Oil Dives as Saudis Output to Rebound Strongly From Attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6807X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
