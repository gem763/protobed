Prosecutors also allege the pair petitioned U.S. politicians, including a congressman, to have the ambassador to Ukraine removed from her post.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski, offered a glimpse into the \u201cvoluminous\u201d evidence that prosecutors have recovered so far on the two men who have become figures in the Trump impeachment proceedings, through \u201cdozens of search warrants,\u201d property searches, and subpoenas. The information includes emails and social media accounts and financial records from more than 50 bank accounts.\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine Henchmen Arrested Over Trump Group Donation\n\nDuring the hearing, Parnas\u2019 attorney, Edward MacMahon, told the judge that his client was told to invoke executive privilege in a letter that was submitted on Parnas\u2019 behalf by John Dowd, a former lawyer for the president, to a congressional committee conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAsked by Judge Paul Oetken if Parnas has worked for the president, MacMahon said no, but that \u201che worked for Mr. Giuliani.\u201d MacMahon said that his concern stems from Parnas having used Giuliani as his lawyer for both personal and business dealings and that Giuliani also works for Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are issues that we need to be very sensitive to,\u201d MacMahon said, not going into detail what those issues are. He continued, adding that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow who is looking at all this evidence. If information gets out that we determine it is all privileged, we\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d MacMahon said in court.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t invoke [executive privilege], only the President of the United States and the government can,\u201d MacMahon said, telling the judge that he doesn\u2019t know how to proceed if the issue arises. \u201cI just wanted to raise the issue with you.\u201d\n\nProsecutors, seemingly shocked by the executive privilege claim, told the judge that while \u201cthis is the first time that we\u2019ve heard of this... we\u2019re happy to have a conversation.\u201d Donaleski, added that the government has already set up a \u201cfilter team,\u201d a separate team of prosecutors within their investigation, who ensure that possibly sensitive information does not get exposed.\n\nThe judge instructed the two sides to discuss the issues over the coming weeks. Parnas and Fruman are scheduled to return to court on Dec. 2.\n\nFlanked by his wife and attorneys, Parnas spoke briefly to the scrum of reporters outside the courthouse saying that he is looking forward to defending himself \u201cvigorously in court.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany false things have been said about me and my family in the press and media recently,\u201d he said, before adding that he is \u201ccertain that in time the truth will be revealed, and I will be vindicated. In the end, I put my faith in God. Thank you.\u201d\n\nHis defense attorney, Joseph Bondy, reiterated the sentiment, saying that his team \u201clooks forward to defending Mr. Parnas in the court based upon the evidence and not a smear campaign that\u2019s been driven by self-serving and misleading leaks apparently from the highest levels of our government.\u201d\n\nProsecutors are also looking into Giuliani\u2019s business dealings as part of their investigation, sources have told The Daily Beast and other news organizations.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested two weeks ago at Washington\u2019s Dulles airport as they were preparing to board a flight to Frankfurt, Germany, holding one-way tickets. When prosecutors learned that the two were leaving the country, they moved quickly to secure the indictments, which were issued a day before the two were apprehended.\n\nThe two have both been released on $1 million bail and are relegated to house arrest while they await trial. Their movements have been restricted to New York, where the trial is scheduled to take place and the Miami area where they both live.", "description": "REUTERSLev Parnas, a Soviet-born business associate with ties to Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, raised the issue of executive privilege during a court proceeding Wednesday, arguing it could apply to some of the evidence gathered in his campaign-finance case in New York.The issue", "authors": ["Pervaiz Shallwani", "Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QUsNfUDvxTLKu1gSGptGhQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/acb2d4e79e101f8e7f32d340f0d7b0dc", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
