It takes only 10 minutes to throw it together in the morning and 10 minutes to finish it in the evening. If you plan to be away for eight hours or more, set the cook time for four hours, then set the slow cooker to auto-switch to warm for the remaining time. (This prevents overcooking.) If you\u2019ll be home when the soup is done and can remove it from the heat, it\u2019s best to cook the chicken for five to six hours. Add only the tortellini you will eat right away. Leftover tortellini will get mushy.", "description": "This satisfying soup is an excellent one-pot dinner to come home to after a long day It takes only 10 minutes to throw it together in the morning and 10 minutes to finish it in the evening If you plan to be away for eight hours or more, set the cook time for four hours, then set the slow cooker to auto-switch to warm for the remaining time", "authors": ["Sarah Digregorio", "Mark Bittman", "Colu Henry", "Pierre Franey", "Tejal Rao", "Lidey Heuck", "Nigella Lawson", "Sam Sifton", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell", "Ali Slagle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/sd-slow-cooker-chicken-tortellini-soup/merlin_161003151_306c755b-5a1d-4d1d-8431-6c9c610cd181-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
