His needs come first. He tells me I am sick and mad in the head.'\n\nGriggs faces a life sentence when he comes back before the court\n\nAlso in an affidavit from the time, Mrs Griggs said: 'During the course of our marriage my husband was bombastic and bullying.\n\n'He has threatened to get me sorted. I took that to mean he will do me harm or will arrange for some other to do me harm.'\n\nFollowing the verdict today, Detective Chief Inspector Kaye Braybrook said: 'Andrew Griggs provided varying accounts of what happened on the evening he last saw Debbie alive, contradicting himself on the time she left the house and the amount of money she took with him.\n\n'He also claimed Debbie's mother asked him to delay reporting her disappearance to the police, which she strongly denied.\n\n'These discrepancies and other holes in Andrew's evidence left us and the jury in no doubt that he had something serious to hide \u2013 namely that he had murdered his wife and disposed of her body.'\n\nMrs Grigg's white Peugeot 309 had been parked in a residential street about a mile away from their home\n\nThe inner lining of the boot was missing and a small trace of her blood was found inside\n\nDCI Baybrook added: 'He has proven himself to be a callous and manipulative individual who has gone to great lengths to destroy his wife's reputation. For 20 years he has heartlessly carried on with his life while Debbie's family and friends have struggled to come to terms with their loss, and having never had the chance to bury her body and say their proper goodbyes.\n\n'Tragically Debbie's mother died just weeks before Andrew was charged with her murder, without ever knowing what happened to her daughter.\n\n'Only Andrew knows how he killed Debbie and what he did with her body, and I appeal to him to have the courage to speak up and enable those who continue to grieve her loss to have some form of closure. It is not too late for him to do the right thing.'", "description": "Mother-of-three Debbie Griggs, of Deal, Kent, disappeared without a trace on May 5, 1999.
