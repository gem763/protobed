So why get more bloated and put extra oxygen into your system? Cutting out fizzy water (and saying no to Champagne, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be offered it) makes everyone more comfortable.\n\nFlying doctor Ben MacFarlane has revealed his top ten tips for staying safe, happy and healthy on holiday. He suggests not chewing gum or drinking fizzy water on planes to avoid excessive gas\n\n2: Forget about chewing gum to stop your ears hurting at take-off or landing. Chewing makes us swallow more air \u2013 just like fizzy water. It\u2019s also a choke-risk in turbulence or bumpy landings. Wiggling your lower jaw and doing some big fake yawns sorts your ears out more safely.\n\n3: Want an extra cup of tea or G&T on a plane? Don\u2019t ask for it until an hour after the meal trays have been cleared away. That\u2019s the magic hour when cabin crew get to eat their own meals. They\u2019ll answer call bells or serve you in the galley. But their smiles won\u2019t be real. And you might not want to know where the slice of lemon was just before it hit your drink.\n\n4: The moment you get into your hotel room unplug the phone (or at least turn the ringer off). That\u2019s what cabin crew friends do. Because no-one wants a wrong number at 3am.\n\n5: Check the bedside alarm clock is showing the right time, because if you\u2019ve got a plane to catch then 7am is not a good time to find out it\u2019s actually 9am \u2013 as I found out to my cost years ago.\n\n6: Never go to sleep without checking the last person who stayed in your room hasn\u2019t left the alarm set to go off at dawn. Unwanted wake-up calls can ruin the best of holidays.\n\n7: Never sleep naked, because only one thing is worse than being woken up at 2am by a hotel fire alarm and having to stumble down the stairs to the car park. And that\u2019s doing it naked because you\u2019re panicking too much to find your clothes. Top travel tip? Sleep in shorts and a t-shirt and you sleep more soundly.\n\nIn his Ben MacFarlane reveals what life is like as a flying doctor\n\n8: Make pickpockets work for their money. Tie the two metal zip tags of your backpack or handbag together with a discrete black shoelace. It won\u2019t stop a determined thief, but it can buy you a split second to see what they\u2019re trying to do. It also stops over-stuffed bags falling open in crowded airports and busy streets.\n\n9: The paper wallet that\u2019s got your hotel room number on and the key card inside? Leave it behind when you go out. Have that lifted from your pocket and the thief knows three things - where you\u2019re staying, what room you\u2019re in and that you\u2019re out. So don\u2019t expect your valuables to be there on your return.\n\n10: Never be too embarrassed to wear a seat belt in a car, taxi or coach. One simple medical fact is worth remembering. The people who survive crashes are the ones who wore their seatbelts. So buckle up. Don\u2019t risk dying of embarrassment.\n\nHoliday SOS: Lifesaving Adventures of a Travelling Doctor by Ben MacFarlane is out now in paperback and e-book on Amazon.", "description": "Ben MacFarlane brings ill or injured holidaymakers back to the UK after a crisis abroad and spends most of his time on planes and in hotels.
