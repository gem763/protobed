The Shanghai Composite Index stood 0.8% higher by midafternoon.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose about 0.5%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index and Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 were little changed.\n\nIn Europe, stocks posted mild gains, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.1% in opening trade. Germany\u2019s DAX rose 0.3%, and the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 0.5%.\n\nThe rises came after U.S. stocks Friday also posted small gains following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that lifted investor hopes for an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nData released at the weekend showed that Chinese imports fell for a fourth- straight month in August, as a drop-off in exports to the U.S. steepened, highlighting the impact of the two countries\u2019 prolonged trade spat.\n\nLarry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group, said the central bank move was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d The lower reserve requirements would have a limited impact on the economy and policy makers are set to do more in the coming months, he said in a note.\n\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Sept. 4, 2019.

Yields rise when prices fall.\n\nEuropean government bond yields rose across the board. The Italian 10-year yield rose to 0.908% from 0.885% Friday. The German 10-year bund was yielding minus 0.616%, up from minus 0.634% before the weekend.\n\nIn currencies, the British pound was down 0.3% against the U.S. dollar at $1.2245. The pound last week fell briefly below $1.20 amid U.K. political turbulence, before recovering slightly amid signs that a no-deal Brexit would be avoided. The queen is expected to sign a bill that would prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a break from the European Union without a deal in place.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude oil rose 0.9% to $62.06 a barrel after Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman appointed Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, an experienced oil official and son of the country\u2019s king, as head of the powerful energy ministry. Prince Abdulaziz is expected to continue OPEC\u2019s efforts to bolster energy prices by cutting production.\n\n\u2014Phillip Waller contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Joanne Chiu at joanne.chiu@wsj.com", "description": "Global markets edged up on Monday after China late Friday undertook stimulus measures as data showed its economy has been pressured by trade tensions with the U.S.", "authors": ["Caitlin Ostroff", "Joanne Chiu", "Caitlin.Ostroff Wsj.Com", "Joanne.Chiu Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105181/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
