But this secure feeling is a relatively recent development.\n\nEveryone over 30 has lived a portion of their life a victim of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. I grew up with frequent \u201cduck and cover\u201d drills in school where we dived under our desks in practice for a potential atomic bomb attack. Russia deployed the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7, in 1959.\n\nThe subsequent nuclear arms race inflicted constant stress on the people of the Western world and those behind the Iron Curtain. My 24-year Air Force career focused on deterring the USSR from annihilating my country.\n\nThe United States and its allies ultimately won that four-decade world war when they outspent and outlasted the Soviets with vast numbers of nuclear warheads and missiles. The hammer and sickle flag over the Soviet Union was retired permanently on Christmas Day, 1991. Since then, Russia has been relegated to nuisance-nation status throughout most of the world.\n\nThe average American today doesn\u2019t lose much sleep over Russia. Many believe that America\u2019s Cold War adversary wouldn\u2019t dare challenge them. And even if they did, Americans assume their military would be able to protect them. However, a new study from Princeton University reveals just how tragically misguided that assessment is.\n\nTensions between the two nations are increasing as both are squaring off yet again over nuclear proliferation. According to Princeton, Russia remains a dire threat to America. Over the past two years, the study concludes, a nuclear war between the United States and Russia has become \u201cdramatically\u201d more plausible. If escalated to the point of no return, a nuclear conflict would absolutely devastate the United States. Within the first few hours alone, the study estimates 34 million people would perish.\n\nSince Russia has become increasingly volatile as of late, America must rethink its strategy. On Sept. 17, 2019, Russia joined with China to conduct large-scale military exercises. This is a move experts believe is meant to convey the nation\u2019s growing military influence as well as an anti-Western, anti-American sentiment. The question is: What can the United States do about it?\n\nFirst, America must not underestimate the threat. Russia maintains the largest nuclear stockpile in the world and is no longer the fragmented entity it was following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained that Russia has closely studied American military strategy and is in the process of developing the technology and tactics to counteract our nation\u2019s inherent military advantages.\n\nRussia is advancing in the capability to target and destroy U.S. satellites in space \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll stop there. Russia is seeking every opportunity to capitalize on America\u2019s military weaknesses. It stands to reason, then, that the United States should be looking to plug each hole before it can be exploited. One huge strategic deficiency is our reliance on Russia for an essential national security tool: Rockets.\n\nCurrently, the United States is wholly dependent on Russian rocket engines to transport cargo and conduct critical national security-related missions to and from space. Russia\u2019s RD-180 rocket engine remains the U.S. Air Force\u2019s pre-eminent propulsion system \u2014 a reality that leaves our country extremely vulnerable.\n\nBy continuing to use the RD-180 engine without any viable domestic alternatives, America is essentially acquiescing control of its space program to Vladimir Putin. Given the growing tension between the two nations, this dependency cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nFortunately, the Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to solve this crisis. The National Security Space Launch program, or NSSL, is an initiative established specifically to eliminate our nation\u2019s dependence on Russia\u2019s rockets. Under the program, the Air Force is scheduled to contract two domestic launch providers to create reliable alternatives to the RD-180. If the program continues on schedule, the United States will phase out the RD-180 rocket engine by 2022 and seamlessly integrate its domestic replacement.\n\nHowever, as is always the case in Washington, partisan politics threatens to take its toll on America\u2019s national security interests. Some members of the House of Representatives have threatened to derail the NSSL program by saddling it with unnecessary modifications and new requirements that will delay the program. The Pentagon has stood fast in opposition to changes to the NSSL, knowing that any delays from Congress could be catastrophic for national security.\n\nThe United States must end its reliance on RD-180 rockets and any other national security instruments manufactured by its adversary. Likewise, the United States must analyze other vulnerabilities within its armed forces and prevent Russia\u2019s exploitation of them. Failure to view Russia as the United States\u2019 greatest national security threat risks America\u2019s pre-eminence on the world stage, or worse, its very survival.\n\n\u2022 Terry Thompson, a freelance author and a retired U.S. Air Force colonel, was a war planner at the Pentagon and wing commander at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
