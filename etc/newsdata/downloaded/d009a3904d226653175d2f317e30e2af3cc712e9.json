I don\u2019t mean your mother\u2019s womb, or Ohio. I mean, where did people come from? Where did the Earth and the sky and the universe come from? Maybe it was an explosion of tiny atoms, or the machinations of a celestial being. Or maybe we were all created in Liv Tyler\u2019s West Village brownstone.\n\n\u201cThis is actually where everyone was a baby. They all started out here as a baby,\u201d Tyler says in last week\u2019s Architectural Digest video tour of her home, wearing a witchy black Givenchy ensemble, and gesturing elegantly around the \u201cchildren\u2019s floor\u201d \u2014 the series of richly textured gray-blue rooms from whence we all came.\n\n\u201cIt looks like everything\u2019s always been here, but actually it wasn\u2019t,\u201d the Creator says wistfully at one point, after struggling momentarily to slide open a pair of pocket doors. In the beginning, you see, \u201cthere was nothing here.\u201d And then there was light, and firmament, and baby pianos (\u201cWe have four kids, haha\u201d) and collections of typewriters, and landlines shaped like lips (\u201cThey don\u2019t make cellphones like that, do they?\u201d). Amen.\n\nLiv Tyler for Architectural Digest is every drunk gay man who has tried to recreate JACKIE. pic.twitter.com/pfHgfOeKaT \u2014 Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) September 5, 2019\n\nTyler\u2019s world \u2014 our world \u2014 is one of knickknacks (\u201cI have this crazy crystal\u201d), and creeping vines (\u201cIt grew into my neighbor\u2019s house, and actually, they\u2019re my friends\u201d), and windows people knock on instead of using the doorbell. It\u2019s a place of charm, chaos, and \u2014 at times \u2014 darkness.\n\nShe who has the power to Create also has the power to Destroy, as Tyler reminds us when she brings us upstairs, to the attic where we will all eventually end up when our time on this precious, floating brownstone comes to a close. Holding up a perfectly preserved Arwen doll from her former life, Tyler says, \u201cI\u2019ve never shown this to her [Ed note: her daughter, and also us] before because it\u2019s rotting away in my attic, in the dust.\u201d A chilling glimpse at our futures.\n\nAt the end of the of 11-minute video, Tyler saw everything she had made, and, behold, it was very good. To see where we all came from, or to teach your children, watch the full video here.\n\nStay in touch.
