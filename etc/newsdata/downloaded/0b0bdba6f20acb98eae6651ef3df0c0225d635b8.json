Darn. Wholesome. Plus the entire plot centres around Woody and Bo Peep reuniting (see, there was a theme to all of this), so watching it during your own reunion would be perfect timing.\n\nIt\u2019ll also be good to take notes, because there may or may not be a particular scene where certain characters have to leave one another (perhaps forever).\n\nAnd for almost spoiling the movie just that second, here\u2019s a little gift from me to you:\n\n#ToyStory4 | Bring it home Join your favourite friends on an adventure of a lifetime ???? Destination = home! #ToyStory4 available on Digital October 1, and Blu-Ray\u2122 & DVD October 9. Posted by Walt Disney Studios on Monday, 9 September 2019\n\nSee that? The Bo Peep to your Woody could be coming to see you so very soon, so get cracking on your comp answer.\n\nDisney and Pixar\u2019s Toy Story 4 is out on Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital on October 9.", "description": "We're sure they'd love to bloody see you.", "authors": ["Louis Costello"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-06-at-10.43.54-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
