Got a chance more than anything to get rested up. ... It was good, and on to a really good, really good Utah team.\"\n\nThe Utes are coming off a 35-0 victory against California, the first time they shut out a conference opponent since joining the Pac-12 in 2011.\n\nWith quarterback Tyler Huntley hobbled by a lower left leg injury, the Utes turned to record-setting Zack Moss, who rushed for 115 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAfter becoming Utah's career leader in yards rushing two weeks ago, Moss increased his total to 33 rushing touchdowns and surpassed Del Rodgers, who set the previous mark of 31 from 1978-81. Moss also reached 100 yards rushing for the 15th time, breaking the school record he shared with Devontae Booker and John White IV.\n\n\"It all feels really good, especially when it comes with winning,\" said Moss, who also had three catches for 89 yards.\n\nMoss said he drew inspiration from Huntley, who had been questionable to play.\n\n\"It makes you want to go harder,\" Moss said. \"I mean, the guy's a warrior. He worked so hard to get ready to play in this game.\"\n\nHuntley threw for 214 yards and a touchdown on 11-of-17 passing in guiding the Utes to a 28-0 halftime lead. He sat out the second half.\n\n\"The offensive line was more determined to protect him and keep the hits off him,\" Utes coach Kyle Whittingham said. \"His toughness rubbed off on the rest of the team.\"\n\nJust as tough was the defense, which held the Golden Bears to 33 yards of total offense in the first half.\n\nThe Utes have allowed only 10 points over their past 3 1/2 games, the lone touchdown coming in the final minute of a 52-7 victory at Oregon State.\n\n\"We know what we're after,\" said Utes defensive back Terrell Burgess, who had a team-high six tackles against Cal. \"We're just trying to make sure we make this season special.\"\n\nOne key Saturday could come on third down.\n\nUtah is allowing opponents to move the chains on just 26.3 percent of third-down attempts, which ranks third in the nation and first in the Pac-12.\n\nThe Huskies, who led the conference in third-down conversion percentage last season, are last in the Pac-12 this year -- and 106th nationally -- at 35.4 percent.\n\n\"We just have to hold each other accountable, and it starts with the leaders of the team,\" Washington senior center Nick Harris told the Seattle Times. \"We've just got to make sure everybody's mind is still set (on winning). We have to have some pride and some dignity.\n\n\"Even though (a Pac-12 title) might not be an option anymore, we've still got a lot of football to play. So we've got to hold each other accountable in that department, and we've just got to make sure we attack every week the same.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Two weeks ago, Washington took a 35-31 home loss to then-No. 12 Oregon.After a bye week, the Huskies (5-3, 2-3 Pac-12) will play host to No. 9 Utah  (7-1,...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
