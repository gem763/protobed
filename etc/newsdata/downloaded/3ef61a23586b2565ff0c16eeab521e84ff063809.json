I and we hope wherever you are, you're OK.\"\n\n\"For the last 100 years or thereabouts, we have been working on a thing called 'Everyday Life,'\" the letter continues. \"In the classifieds, you might write 'double album for sale, one very careful owner.' One half is called 'Sunrise,' the other 'Sunset.' It comes out (Nov. 22). It is sort of how we feel about things. We send much love to you from hibernation.\"\n\nMore: Gwyneth Paltrow gets cozy with ex Chris Martin's girlfriend Dakota Johnson over dinner\n\nChris Martin of Coldplay (Photo: Brent N.
