While he was the only leader of his hemisphere in attendance, other heads of state also took part in the 2,000-strong foreign delegation. Bolsonaro met with one of them, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, shortly after the ceremony.\n\n\u201cIn meeting with world leaders and businesspeople on this occasion, we also brought the new Brazil to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky,\u201d Bolsonaro wrote. Zelensky appears in the video meeting with Bolsonaro, as well, though neither side offered details on what was discussed at that meeting.\n\n\u00c9 uma satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o ser o \u00fanico l\u00edder do continente americano presente na cerim\u00f4nia de entroniza\u00e7\u00e3o do novo imperador Japon\u00eas, Naruhito.

Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) October 22, 2019\n\nJust as Brazil seeking more trade with Japan, Zelensky told reporters Kyiv is hoping for more Brazilian investment in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cBrazil is our main trading partner in Latin America. I welcome the expansion of Brazilian companies in Ukraine and Ukrainian ones in Brazil,\u201d Zelensky said. He added that his administration was seeking to remove the government from business and de-nationalize companies brought into the state fold by past presidents. Bolsonaro also reportedly agreed to visit Ukraine next year and invited Zelensky to visit Brazil at his convenience.\n\nZelensky and Bolsonaro joined presidents Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, among others, as the heads of state in attendance. Several Latin American nations, including Colombia and Uruguay, send their foreign ministers. The United States sent Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. Embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also attended the ceremony in Tokyo.\n\nNaruhito officially became emperor six months ago following the abdication of his father, Akihito. He acquired the formal powers in a short ceremony at the time, but had not yet performed the extended traditional Sokuirei-Seiden-no-Gi ceremony. According to Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun, Naruhito\u2019s extended ceremony featured a proclamation that a new emperor has arisen to the world. Japan has used the same ceremony to receive an emperor for nearly 2,000 years.\n\n\"Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!\" Japan's Emperor Naruhito proclaims his ascension to the throne in an elaborate ceremony that dates back nearly 2,000 years. He is Japan\u2019s first new emperor in 30 years, inheriting the throne from his father who stepped down due to poor health. pic.twitter.com/uE52XBW3MJ \u2014 DW News (@dwnews) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cI pledge hereby that I shall act according to the Constitution and fulfill my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people of Japan, while always wishing for the happiness of the people and the peace of the world, turning my thoughts to the people and standing by them,\u201d Naruhito said on Tuesday in completing the ceremony to ascend to the Chrysanthemum throne.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Bolsonaro is expected to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Brazilians living in Japan. He planned his Japanese itinerary to ensure at least one night on Monday to explore Tokyo, where he was allowed some time to roam freely as few locals identified him as the Brazilian head of state, reportedly stopping at the Meiji Shinto shrine. Bolsonaro admitted to reporters that he was wary of the raw fish typical in a Japanese diet and ended up at a Tokyo diner for his evening meal on Monday. One of his goals in meeting with Abe will be to enhance trade ties with Japan, encouraging the prime minister to consider importing Brazilian beef and pork. Bolsonaro reportedly joked that he would not eat meat in Japan until the government agreed to import Brazilian meat.\n\nThe banquet following Naruhito\u2019s coronation reportedly featured alternative \u201cWestern\u201d dishes for dignitaries not open to exploring traditional Japanese food. The Japanese dinner included \u201cgrilled young seabream, salt steamed abalone, and a soup of Japanese spiny lobster and \u2018matsutake\u2019 mushrooms.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil attended the enthronement of Japanese Emperor Naruhito as the only head of state from the Americas.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177531143-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
