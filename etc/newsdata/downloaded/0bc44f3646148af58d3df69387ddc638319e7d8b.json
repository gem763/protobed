Here's a Glossary of Some Common Terms", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI was using magic last night when someone messaged to ask if I needed to be picked up from school.\u201d No, that\u2019s not a line from Harry Potter. It\u2019s the kind of thing a Hong Kong protestor might say after a clash with police.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protestors have their own argot. Cantonese, Hong Kong\u2019s lingua franca, is complicated enough with its nine tones. But even a native speaker might not understand a conversation between protestors, who have created between them a unique vocabulary.\n\nAlthough many would accuse them of making light of violent unrest, the use of slang \u201ckeeps people sane,\u201d argues Wee Lian Hee, a language professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cIf [protestors] talk formally all the time, I suspect the movement would soon become tiresome,\u201d he tells TIME.\n\nThe recent withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill, initially the trigger of the demonstrations, has done little to pacify public anger. Protestors continue to take to the streets, communicating in a jargon that reveals much about how they see each other, the authorities, and their actions.\n\n\u624b\u8db3 Sau Zuk (\u201cHands and Feet\u201d)\n\nProtestors refer to each other as \u201chands and feet.\u201d The term conveys the idea of unity: when the hands and feet of a protestor are injured, other protestors feel his or her pain.\n\n\u767c\u5922 Faht Moong (\u201cDreaming\u201d)\n\n\u201cI dreamed that I threw a petrol bomb last night,\u201d a protestor might say \u2014 except he wasn\u2019t actually dreaming. Many use the word to avoid directly stating that they were involved in unlawful activity.\n\nRiot police stand off against demonstrators inside New Town Plaza shopping mall, operated by Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., during a protest in the Shatin district of Hong Kong, China, on Sunday, July 14, 2019. | Paul Yeung/Bloomberg via Getty Images More\n\n\u884c\u8857 Hahng Gaai (\u201cShopping\u201d)\n\nSimilar to \u201cdreaming,\u201d the term \u201cshopping\u201d (literally to stroll around, or walk the streets) is used euphemistically to mean one was out at a protest. With clashes between police and protestors often occurring in busy retail districts that are home to glitzy malls, the \u201cshopping\u201d metaphor is oddly apt.\n\nVandalized turnstiles stand inside Tung Chung station, operated by MTR Corp,. during a protest in Hong Kong, China, on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019. | Paul Yeung/Bloomberg via Getty Images More\n\n\u9ee8\u9435 Daung Teet (\u201cCommunist Party Rail\u201d)\n\nEver since it started shuttering train stations closest to protest sites, the city\u2019s subway operator has been accused by protestors of siding with the police, who in turn are seen as an arm of the Beijing-backed government. Protesters have responded by vandalizing stations, destroying equipment such as ticket machines, and referring to the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) with this derogatory term, which rhymes with the actual name of the MTR in Cantonese.", "description": "Hong Kong's protestors communicate in a jargon that reveals much about how they see each other, the authorities, and their actions.", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WYUUA_Dhb4V838C0G4X0PA--~B/aD0yODI1O3c9NDI0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/f8f69210f1f60a176f09982b9bdd9bf9", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
