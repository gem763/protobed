Some analysts suggest the ECB will start buying euro zone equities, not just government bonds, in a new wave of quantitative easing.\n\nBy 1040 GMT, the euro was steady against the dollar at $1.10335. It slipped to $1.10155 overnight, its weakest since Sept. 4.\n\nHedge funds have added more short euro positions, taking the amount of contracts to $6.74 billion in the week to Sept. 3, the highest in a month, though positions were not as big as in April. EURNETUSD=\n\n\"The default is to be negative euro into ECB,\" said Kenneth Broux, head of corporate research at Societe Generale (PA: ).\n\n\"Resuming bond purchases won't do anything\" to the euro zone economy because \"the monetary policy in Europe has stopped being effective,\" Broux said. \"The ECB has done all it can.\"\n\nThe , which tracks the U.S. currency against six other currencies , was flat at 98.33. The dollar was also confined to a narrow range against the yen as traders weighed the prospect of U.S. rate cuts against their demand for safe-haven assets. Dollar/yen was last up 0.1% at 107.02 .\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the U.S. economic expansion, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday in Zurich, bolstering expectations for a rate cut at the Fed's meeting on Sept. 18. sterling turned positive to reach a six-week high of $1.2385 GBP=D3 after better-than-expected British economic data and because some banks have revised down their no-deal Brexit expectations.\n\nTraders waited to see whether the British parliament would vote to hold an early general election before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. If a snap election were held and the Conservative Party won, it could scrap recent legislation to extend Britain's exit from the European Union for a third time.\n\nAgainst the euro, sterling was up 0.6% at 89.17, having hit earlier a six-week high of 90.13.
