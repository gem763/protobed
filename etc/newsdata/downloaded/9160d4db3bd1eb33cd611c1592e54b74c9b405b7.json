My daughter,\u201d she said, her voice, for a few seconds, louder than the drone of propellers that muffles most other sounds at the rescue centre on Nassau in the Bahamas.\n\nRussell, a housekeeper from Great Abaco island, had stayed inside her home when Hurricane Dorian pounded the northern islands of the Bahamas over the weekend. But after hours inside, her downstairs flooded, the roof flew off and she was left with no other option but to run.\n\nShe left her home, clutching her six-year-old grandson Chrishon with both arms close to her chest.\n\n\u201cAs I was running the wind was picking me up and licking me down,\u201d she told the Guardian. Somehow she made it across the street to a neighbour\u2019s home, still standing. \u201cI lifted my hands up and I said: Lord, help me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chrishanti Darishon hugs her son Chrishon in Nassau, Bahamas, after he arrived from Abaco where he rode out Hurricane Dorian with his grandmother.

She reached a shelter, and slept for three nights in a small room with 12 other people.\n\n\u201cI thought no one was coming to rescue us,\u201d said Chrishon, his bright yellow T-shirt still daubed with three large dirt stains.\n\nBut on Wednesday afternoon the two were evacuated by jet plane, and reunited with family in Nassau.\n\nThe reality of her situation was only just dawning on the 46-year-old grandmother: \u201cI have nothing left. Absolutely nothing. Only the clothes that I have on my body right now,\u201d she said.\n\nMarsh Harbour before and after Marsh Harbour in Great Abaco, photographed before and after Hurricane Dorian struck.

About 20 relief organizations have mobilized on the Bahamas, including the US Coast Guard and the Royal Marines who have run emergency evacuations for critically ill people since Tuesday.\n\nBut with the airports in the northern islands either still closed or completely destroyed, delivering aid and continuing evacuations has been slow.\n\nA steady stream of evacuees from the Abaco Islands streamed into the rescue centre at a private airstrip in Nassau throughout Wednesday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gary Smith, 69, a retired customs official, after arriving in Nassau Bahamas from Abaco.

In the Bahamas, 90% of the population professes a religion, the vast majority aligned with the Protestant faith.\n\nSmith said he evacuated with his wife as the eye of Dorian passed over his home, its roof already blown away.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast, some water was beating in, and we had to get sandbags \u2013 by the time I tried to get back into the room I couldn\u2019t even get in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019ve been on this Earth, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.
