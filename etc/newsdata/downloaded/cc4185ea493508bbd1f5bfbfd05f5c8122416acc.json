Senator Mike Rounds?\u2026\n\nVeering from the Teleprompter script to vent his hatred for renewable energy technology, Trump said energy saving light bulbs are no good because they make him \u201clook orange.\u201d\n\nHe acted out an extended imaginary scene in which an annoyed wife asks someone called \u201cCharlie\u201d why their television no longer shows the Democratic debate. Switching voice to the husband, he replied: \u201cDarling, the wind isn\u2019t blowing, the goddamn windmill stopped.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
