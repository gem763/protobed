The agreement also allowed 230 poker machines and 40 gaming tables.\n\nThe project was set back in February after it was discovered aluminium panels the centre were made of the same material used in the fatal Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017.\n\nThe building was expected to be opened in 2020.\n\nImages from the aftermath of the blaze show the roof was torn apart and charred pieces of construction material littered all over the floor.\n\nPictures from inside the casino show the extent of the damage as large chunks of the roof had been destroyed and the sky can be seen from the interior.\n\nCharred pieces of the roof and insulation material fell onto the ground and covered the floor.\n\nThe basement of the building was completed flooded and images show water completely covering the floor and nearly submerging nearby construction equipment.\n\nImages from the aftermath of the blaze show the roof was torn apart and charred pieces of construction material littered all over the floor\n\nFirefighters were required to enter small cranes that lifted them up to the roof in order to fight the fire.\n\nAdditional crews were called in from outside the region to help fight the fire.\n\nHundreds of nearby workers were forced to evacuate the area while emergency crews attempted to bring the fire under control.\n\nThe roads surrounding the fire were blocked off, forcing traffic to a standstill.\n\nPedestrians were forced to shield their faces as the thick black smoke covered the city after police issued a warning stating the smoke may have been toxic.\n\nAbout three hours after the fire started, one person suffered serious injuries from smoke inhalation and was rushed to Auckland City Hospital.\n\nDave Woon, Assistant Area Commander for Fire and Emergency NZ Auckland told reporters when the fire started, it was moving quickly and was a 'very challenging fire to fight'.\n\n'It is a large fire involving gas cylinders that started around the roof and guttering area and there is insulation on fire that appears to be straw making it a very challenging fire to extinguish,' Mr Woon said.\n\nThe basement of the building was completed flooded and images show water completely covering the floor and nearly submerging nearby construction equipment\n\nConcerns were raised about the water in the basement may be contaminated as it would need to be pumped into the Manakau Harbour.\n\nWater quality tests were conducted and they concluded contamination levels were low enough for it to be pumped into the harbour.\n\nAfter about 1.8million litres of water were funnelled into the harbour, it was declared safe enough to be diverted into the city's wastewater system on Thursday.\n\nCouncil staff responsible for removing the water said it may take 4-6 days for it to be pumped out and could potentially have human health and ecological impacts.\n\nFire and Emergency NZ said the largest parts of the fire had been extinguished and an investigation has begun.\n\n'No more smoke, no more big flames, but there is still work to do. Firefighters continue to work through the overhaul phase by pulling bits of iron and roofing materials out and damping down hotspots,' FENZ said.\n\n'We have reduced to one aerial and six appliances. A large crane will be placed on Nelson street tomorrow morning. We hope to have this removed by Monday. The investigation has commenced. Barring unexpected developments, this will be our last update.'\n\nThough firefighters continue to battle the blaze three days after it started, the convention centre was reopened on Thursday", "description": "The raging fire on the roof of the under-construction SkyCity convention centre in Auckland, New Zealand broke out on Tuesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Thomas Duff For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/03/20162336-0-image-a-16_1571969671199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
