Consider the genteel poverty of protagonists in novels by chroniclers of class such as Edith Wharton, Louisa May Alcott, and Jane Austen. Regardless of their reduced circumstances, these characters would have been shocked by the idea that they should be responsible for sweeping, let alone mopping, their own floors. In perhaps literature\u2019s most extreme example, even the eternally optimistic but penniless Micawber family from Charles Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield can\u2019t imagine giving up its servant.\n\nThis situation remained the status quo for so long because it relied on a cheap and abundant supply of labor from unskilled workers, most of them easily exploited women and children who had few, if any, other options, and no employee protections. A 2013 Mother Jones examination of the history of domestic workers reports that, according to the 1870 census, \u201c52 percent of employed women worked in \u2018domestic and personal service.\u2019\u201d From 1870 through the mid-1900s, that percentage only increased. According to the Encyclopedia of Chicago,\n\ndomestic service represented the leading occupation of women in Chicago and the nation. \u2026 domestic work attracted few native-born women because of the long hours, low status, lack of freedom, and close supervision. Consequently, domestic servants often came from the ranks of the most desperate members of the community, either those too poor to pay for housing or those excluded from other vocations.\n\nIn 1912, a \u201chired girl\u201d with 33 years of experience anonymously published a narrative of the trials of her line of work, in what was the era\u2019s equivalent of the hit novel The Help:\n\nThere is often no Sunday out until after four and no evening out until after eight. Foreign girls do not go into housework for this reason. They prefer the fixed hours of factory and shop work. Ladies are sometimes not honest in money matters concerning the girls they employ. I have known many nice girls to work for little money\u2014two dollars and a half or three dollars a week\u2014and one week out of every five or six the lady would forget, or pretend to forget, to pay for. If the girl has given no written receipt for her wages, she sometimes has no proof of what is due her.\n\nAfter the Great Migration brought multitudes of African Americans from the rural south to the urban north in the early 20th century, black women took over the bulk of these exploitative jobs. Only during the Great Depression, and then temporarily, did this dynamic shift, according to the National Women\u2019s History Museum:\n\nUnemployment was especially severe among African-American women. Many African American women lost their positions as domestic servants to white women who entered the market during the Depression. In urban areas, they were forced to convene on city corners in \u201cslave markets,\u201d hoping to be hired for very low-paid day labor.\n\nBy 1970, appliances, ready-made food, and other technologies had reduced both the amount and the rigor of household work and rendered domestic help a luxury. By the 1980s, household help was played for laughs on sitcoms such as \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel Air\u201d and \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201d It was a running joke on \u201cThe Gilmore Girls\u201d that Lorelei Gilmore\u2019s wealthy mother Emily couldn\u2019t keep a maid. By then, only women of Emily\u2019s class were expected to have one.", "description": "The absence of maids\u2014exploited, largely invisible workers who decades ago made keeping a house in order look much easier\u2014is one of the biggest reasons today\u2019s middle-class families feel stretched for time.", "authors": ["Ester Bloom"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/09/Jill_Esmond_and_Laurence_Olivier_1932/facebook.jpg?1522838731", "published_at": "2015-09-23"}
