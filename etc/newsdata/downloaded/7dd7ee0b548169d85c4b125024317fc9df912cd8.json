However, he warned: \u201cThis is a big assumption as talks could easily fail again if both parties don\u2019t find a compromise.\u201d\n\nHong Kong and Seoul each edged up 0.1 percent while Tokyo went into the break 0.5 percent higher with Singapore jumping more than one percent.\n\nSydney was flat, while there were gains in Taipei but Shanghai slipped 0.4 percent.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if we\u2019ve pretty much hit the bottom in some sectors and we should actually be near an inflection point,\u201d Margie Patel at Wells Fargo Asset Management told Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Fed cutting rates pretty much all of this year. It takes a while for that to feed into the economy. I think the worst is pretty much behind us.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sterling capped \u2013\n\nWhile the earnings season is in full swing, investors are also keeping tabs on the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting this week, which could see it cut borrowing costs once again.\n\nBut OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley said: \u201cPart of the overnight rally on Wall Street was also driven by the almost 100 percent expectation, that the (Fed policy board) will cut rates.\n\n\u201cYet here we are with record, or near-record, highs in US stocks, an interim trade deal on the horizon, mostly peachy US earnings, and US data that is overall, still well on the bright side.\u201d\n\nAlso in focus are events in London where Boris Johnson will try on Tuesday to pass a bill that would allow him to call a general election in December.\n\nHaving failed to get the two-thirds majority in parliament to take Britain to the polls, the prime minister will now put forward a second plan to legislate for a poll on December 12, which would require only a simple majority to pass.\n\nJohnson is confident he can win a majority at the national vote that will allow him to push through his stalled Brexit deal.\n\nThe move comes after European leaders granted another three-month extension to the Brexit deadline, just days before Britain was about to crash out of the bloc without a deal.\n\nSterling rallied on the EU decision, though analysts pointed out that the continued uncertainty was keeping a lid on the currency for now.\n\n\u201cAlthough a hard Brexit looks almost impossible now, electoral uncertainty will make pound rallies past $1.3000 nearly as unlikely in the near-term,\u201d said Halley.\n\nOil prices were flat after Monday\u2019s big losses that were sparked by reports of another pick-up in US stockpiles that indicate weakening demand, which offset the upbeat vibe caused by the trade talks.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 0230 GMT \u2013\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 0.5 percent at 22,975.13 (break)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.1 percent at 26,905.92\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: DOWN 0.4 percent at 2,967.95\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2847 from $1.2859 at 2100 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 86.39 pence from 86.29 pence\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 108.98 yen from 108.95 yen\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1094 from $1.1099\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN eight cents at $55.73 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP one cent at $61.58 per barrel\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.5 percent at 27.090.72 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.1 percent at 7,332.28 (close)", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Asian markets mostly rose Tuesday, taking up the baton after a record close on Wall Street, with investors filled with a renewed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/d9dd93_boris-johnson-try-on-tuesday-get-westminster-mps-his-bid-election-in-asian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
