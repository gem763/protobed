The project will comprise three-bedroom apartments ranging from 170sq m up to 260sq m in size, with an average price selling price at about $18,000 per sq m.\n\nMr Mills said he aimed to get 50 per cent presales on the project, which will have an end value between $35 million and $40 million, before starting construction by the start of the next financial year. Construction time would be about 18 months, he said.\n\nThey have to do it on commercial terms \u2013 with a gross profit margin of about 25 per cent \u2013 to unlock bank financing, but said in the current market where developers were holding off new projects and defect concerns made buyers wary about off-the-plan purchases, people would be reassured by his fixed-price contract method that did not cut costs.\n\nQuality was often cut out of design-and-construct contracts, Mr Mills said.\n\n\"Important assets like a 7-star NatHERS energy rating and so on are lost because they add to the cost,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis project is being funded by CBA, his firm's long-term bank, but the attraction of such developments to investors was clear from the fact that four non-bank lenders had offered to finance the same project, Mr Mills said.\n\nMr Angelini, the managing partner of consultancy Stannards, said future projects would likely offer an above-bank return on funds invested as well as a stake in the development profit.\n\n\"Everybody's chasing returns greater than 5 per cent,\" he said. \"In this model the high net worth person receives a premium to bank funding, ensuring a very handsome return on otherwise low yielding funds.\"", "description": "Rob Mills, who has a long record of designing premium homes, wants to marry investors' demand for yield with buyers' wish for good-quality apartments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5464%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/02438da8bf4eca122d5800c4c60718652fa6d65f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
