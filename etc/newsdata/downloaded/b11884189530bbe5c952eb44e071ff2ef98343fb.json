After his mysterious disappearance in the playoffs last season, and news of an arthritic knee, the negative coverage of the Los Angeles Rams running back was practically everywhere.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThen on Thursday, Rams coach Sean McVay said Gurley won\u2019t even be on a play count to start the season. Oh.\n\nSean McVay said Todd Gurley won\u2019t be limited\n\nLindsay Thiry of ESPN reported that McVay said Gurley won\u2019t be limited against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Gurley is as good as new. McVay could be throwing off the Panthers in their preparation. Gurley could be on that plan, then his knee acts up again. One statement by McVay doesn\u2019t erase all the other pessimistic news of the offseason.\n\nBut for anyone who drafted Gurley in their fantasy drafts, it\u2019s pretty good news.\n\nRams invested in backup running backs\n\nGurley was one of the NFL\u2019s true workhorse backs before late last season. In the playoffs, he was suddenly splitting time nearly equally with C.J. Anderson. Even in the Super Bowl against the Patriots, Gurley was far from a full-time player.\n\nGurley has knee injuries in his past, though he\u2019s just 25 years old. The Rams matched Detroit\u2019s restricted free agent offer sheet for Malcolm Brown and moved up to draft Darrell Henderson in the third round. They invested in the backs behind Gurley, a sign they didn\u2019t know what to expect from their star. Whatever McVay said this week, we\u2019ll need to see what the actual plan is for Gurley when the Rams kick off the season.\n\nOf all the players in Week 1, Gurley has to be one of the most mysterious.\n\nLos Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley was limited late last season by knee issues.
