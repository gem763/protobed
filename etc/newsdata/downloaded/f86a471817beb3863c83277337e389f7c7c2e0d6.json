In dramatic testimony on Monday, she roped in some of Trump's top advisers as witnesses to the unfolding controversy.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, a senior State Department official, George Kent, appeared on Capitol Hill to testify about his knowledge of the episode despite an attempt by administration lawyers to block him, according to a source working on the impeachment inquiry. The House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena for his testimony Tuesday morning, and Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, complied.\n\nIt's the latest evidence that the White House\u2019s stonewalling against congressional requests for documents and testimony is crumbling \u2014 and Democrats are feeling a new sense of momentum.\n\n\"Thank you to patriots like @realDonaldTrump appointee Fiona Hill who chose to ignore the obstruction from Trump and gave testimony to Congress today,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). \"The truth will keep coming out. And Trump cannot stop it.\"\n\nIn closed-door testimony described by a source in the room, Hill detailed increasing alarm among White House officials over the shadow diplomacy efforts of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who mounted a months-long campaign to dirty Biden on unfounded charges.\n\nShe said she shared her concerns with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton who encouraged her to report her concerns about Giuliani's efforts to a National Security Council lawyer \u2014 which she did twice. Hill also connected Giuliani's efforts to Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, indicating that Bolton characterized their efforts on Ukraine as a \"drug deal.\"\n\nAccording to a source in the room Monday, Hill said Bolton compared Giuliani to \"a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\"\n\nAnd the flood of damaging information surely isn't over.\n\nAs lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, a growing number of witnesses this week will describe their own role in the controversy, even as the White House has vowed not to engage with House Democrats\u2019 \u201cillegitimate\u201d impeachment effort. The Democratic Caucus is also set to meet Tuesday night after a two-week recess to discuss the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael McKinley, who abruptly resigned last week as a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, intends to testify before lawmakers.\n\nOn Thursday comes Gordon Sondland, the EU ambassador whose text messages revealed by lawmakers indicated he was aware of efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden. Sondland is reportedly ready to deflect any blame onto Trump about whether there was any quid pro quo.\n\nCongressional investigators on Friday will hear from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, who oversees Russia- and Ukraine-related matters at the Pentagon.\n\nDespite the series of breakthroughs, Democrats will still face resistance from the White House to some of their high-level requests.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump's budget office planned to comply with a Tuesday subpoena deadline for documents, a senior administration official did not say, instead pointing to a White House letter last week that deemed the House impeachment probe \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nBut Hill's account underscores how the president's once-impenetrable barrier to meaningful testimony in Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry has been blown apart.\n\n\"The walls are closing in. The details we are learning about the shadow foreign policy operation Trump has been running to benefit himself personally are stunning,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \"Why have a democracy, if we allow this to happen without consequence?\"\n\nThough Hill's testimony was the most damning to date, she wasn't the first to put a crack in Trump's wall.\n\nEarlier this month, former Ambassador Kurt Volker provided text messages between himself and other diplomats in which they described concerns that Trump was using a potential White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and possibly even military aid, as a cudgel to force the besieged country to probe Biden. Volker testified for nine hours to lawmakers and aides behind closed doors. Trump has forcefully denied any sort of \"quid pro quo\" occurred.", "description": "Donald Trump's impeachment blockade has collapsed.
