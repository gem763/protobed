I'm slightly chuckling, slightly gutted that (caddie) Johnny Long Socks, John McLaren, isn't here with me. But this is an incredibly prestigious trophy, it's got a lot of history to it on the European Tour, so I'm over the moon.\"\n\nCasey birdied Nos. 16 and 17 but parred the last hole to give Ritthammer and MacIntyre hope of a potential playoff. Ritthammer's birdie attempt was just short and MacIntyre's eagle attempt slid by the hole.\n\nCasey, a four-time Ryder Cup player, is the third successive English player to win the tournament after 2017 winner Jordan Smith and Richard McEvoy in 2018.\n\nHome favorite Ritthammer, Scottish rookie MacIntyre and Austria's Matthias Schwab finished at 13 under in a three-way tie for second, one ahead of Bernd Wiesberger.\n\nCasey led after opening with a 66 at Green Eagle Golf Courses on Thursday, shot a second round 73 but fought back Saturday with a 69.", "description": "Ryder Cup star Paul Casey carded a 6-under 66 to win the European Open by one shot on Sunday for his first European Tour title in five years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-Paul-Casey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
