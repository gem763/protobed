Fox News knows of no federal investigation of his rival for any violations of any American law. If it is determined that the president made that request to help his campaign for reelection, President Trump may have violated federal law. It is illegal to ask a foreign national or foreign country for any political assistance. To our knowledge, no president before President Trump in American history has publicly asked an adversary in to investigate a rival.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAs for the Biden campaign, last night the former vice president said what he did in Ukraine was fully transparent and was carried out in front of the whole world. There is no known evidence to support President Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories about Biden\u2019s activities, as we have reported here repeatedly.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cToday, the president did exactly what he\u2019s accused of doing. This time on live television. And this time, he asked the totalitarian government of China to investigate his will ahead of trade talks scheduled for next week.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of Fox News Channel's \"Shepard Smith Reporting,\"\u00a0anchor\u00a0Shepard Smith suggested President Donald Trump\u00a0asking China to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden as illegal. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/FiredShep1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
