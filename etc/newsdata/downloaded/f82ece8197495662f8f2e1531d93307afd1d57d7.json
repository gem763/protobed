An inverted yield curve has preceded past recessions.\n\nA recession could throw a wrench into the aforementioned investing play comparing stock yields to bond yields.\n\n\u201cThe worst case scenario is that we get a deep recession and companies have to cut their dividends,\u201d Colas added. \u201cThat happened after the financial crisis, when the companies of the S&P 500 cut dividends by an aggregate of 25%. If the same were to happen again now, the real yield on the S&P would be 1.5% - which is still the same as Treasuries.\u201d\n\nFor context, Yahoo Finance analysis shows American Express (AXP), Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Nike (NKE) and Disney (DIS) are the only components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) that yielded a smaller percentage than the 10-year Treasury.\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
