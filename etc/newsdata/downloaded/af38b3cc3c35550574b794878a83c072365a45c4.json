So far in Anglo-Australian encounters at World Cups we have one victory apiece in the final, two England quarter-final wins and two Aussie pool wins. That is some back story as we build to Saturday.\n\nI'm confident of an England victory as long as their mindset is exactly right after a two-week lay-off. They can't afford a sloppy opening 10-15 minutes but one of the distinguishing features of this team under Eddie Jones has been their fast points-scoring starts. More of the same, please.\n\nFor me, England have been efficiently ticking over in third gear, waiting to really pick up speed in the knockout stages. I had them down to produce something special in the France match, but alas that never took place so now they must waste no time engaging top gear.\n\nI am confident England can beat Australia as long as their mindset is exactly right from the off\n\nThere are a stack of quality players queuing up to do that \u2014 Jamie George, Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola (if fit), Owen Farrell, Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Elliot Daly. So far they have been good, from this moment onwards they must be great.\n\nAnd disciplined. England have been brilliant in that department but must keep going. Australia are all over the place with their reckless, wild tackling and cards in every game. Make that a big point of difference.\n\nAs for Australia, their legendary former skipper George Gregan nailed it on Saturday when he insisted they need to 'flick a switch'. That's exactly what they did against New Zealand in the Rugby Championship and the result was a record Wallaby win over the All Blacks.\n\nExcept for their second half against Wales, when they upped the tempo and intensity and nearly salvaged the game, the Aussies have been one-paced and predictable throughout this tournament.\n\nIt's because their midfield isn't functioning. They travelled with two specialist No 10s \u2014 Christian Lealiifano and Bernard Foley \u2014and have also turned to strong-running inside centre Matt Toomua at fly-half.\n\nAustralia have been one-paced and predictable throughout the World Cup so far\n\nAs Australia also selected an old-fashioned blockbuster at 12 in Samu Kerevi, the result is no balance or fluency in the midfield, no real creativity or variety with which to launch some dangerous runners.\n\nCoach Michael Cheika has to address this, it's taking the wind out of Australia's sails. It's doubly mystifying when such a gifted playmaker like Kurtley Beale seems to have become a fringe figure. This is the country who gave us the Ella/Lynagh combo back in the day. They virtually invented the twin playmaker concept as far as modern-day Test rugby is concerned.\n\nCheika's selection in midfield is the key to Australia mounting a serious challenge and the other factor is that none of those four players mentioned is a front-line, Test rugby goal-kicker other than Foley, who seems to be a little off form.\n\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines it could be quite an entertaining week if Jones and Cheika decide to lock horns verbally. Neither is a shrinking violet and both have their own sweet way with words. If you can't have a bit of banter before an England v Australia World Cup quarter-final, when can you?\n\nWhat I would say, with my coaching hat on, is work out exactly what you want to say, what little quip or wind-up you want to employ, before the press conference. Make sure you hit the bullseye rather than ad lib something you think might be clever but rebounds a little. Let battle commence on that one.\n\nPrediction: England\n\nIRELAND VS NEW ZEALAND\n\nIts going to be tight. New Zealand look in good shape but this is probably not their preferred quarter-final, having lost two of their last three matches with Ireland. Ireland started the tournament well but stumbled big time against Japan before recovering against Russia and Samoa. It was also encouraging to see Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray back in the groove against Samoa. I sincerely hope Bundee Aki doesn't get a ban \u2014 his red card was very unlucky and he deserves to be available for this huge match.\n\nPrediction: New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand look in good shape so far but Ireland is probably not their preferred quarter-final\n\nWALES VS FRANCE\n\nWales, other than a clunky first half against Uruguay on Sunday, have been very impressive and this is probably their dream quarter-final against a side they have defeated in seven of their last eight meetings. They will also be hugely motivated, still, by their World Cup semi-final defeat by France in 2011.\n\nWales have been firing in all the important areas \u2014 scrum, line-out, restarts \u2014 and Justin Tipuric and Aaron Wainwright have been outstanding in the back row.\n\nAs for their backs, it's been a thrill to watch Jonathan Davies, Gareth Davies and the try-scoring flair of Josh Adams, the man whose talent finally blossomed in the Premiership having been virtually discarded by the Welsh system. If ever there is an argument for allowing players to develop in other countries and to be selected when they are playing overseas, it is Adams. Italy and Argentina, take note.\n\nWales have been very impressive and playing France is probably their dream quarter-final\n\nThere are a couple of injury worries. Davies came off with a knock in the Fiji game and he is the key man behind the scrum, and Biggar is going through concussion protocols after also going off against Fiji. Biggar is an influential player but Wales will lose little if Rhys Patchell is required.\n\nFrance are difficult to read. If they replicate the first 40 minutes of their opening game against the Pumas with Antoine Dupont, Damien Penaud and Romain Ntamack flying, France will take Wales all the way. But the trouble is they haven't come close since and in fact could easily have lost to Tonga. They badly needed that cancelled game with England to find themselves again.\n\nWales are better coached and fitter, and although I am expecting France to perform strongly, it will be in vain.\n\nPrediction: Wales\n\nJAPAN VS SOUTH AFRICA\n\nI have been blown away by the excellence, pace and energy of Japan and they have done themselves and their country proud with their 'bullet rugby' \u2014 the basics done perfectly at incredible pace. But I believe their World Cup ends here. A quarter-final was their stated goal so Sunday was probably their final. They are unbelievably fit so can go again against the Boks, but emotionally I fear not. South Africa won't be caught by surprise after the shock 2015 loss in Brighton.\n\nPrediction: South Africa", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: This game will be massive.
