The outrage over their role as protector of al-Qaeda before and after the 9/11 attacks has given way to a sense of inevitability that the Taliban will not be crushed out of existence, and a realization that a peaceful Afghanistan requires them to be integrated into the political system.\n\nBut why invite them to Camp David \u2014 in the same week as the 18th anniversary of 9/11? That\u2019s a question being asked by both Democrats and Republicans after Trump revealed the plans over the weekend:\n\nThe Trump administration is facing bipartisan backlash after a plan to secretly host members of the Taliban at Camp David just days before 9/11. There are new revelations there was internal discord within the administration over the idea. @kwelkernbc has the latest. pic.twitter.com/1FNhCFrfRh \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 9, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump is facing backlash after announcing he planned to hold a secret meeting with the Taliban at Camp David this weekend but canceled it over attacks overseas that left 12 dead, including one American. Republican and Democratic leaders sharply criticized the president over two main concerns: bringing members of the Taliban to the U.S.\u2014specifically to Camp David, a presidential retreat for presidents used for administrations, and the timing of the meeting \u2014 just days before the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSome of this comes from Trump antagonists, such as Eric Swalwell and Justin Amash, who asked on Twitter, \u201cHow about we end the war without inviting the Taliban to dinner on the week of 9/11?\u201d However, Liz Cheney isn\u2019t exactly a Never Trumper, and she ripped the idea as well. Cheney did try to couch it in praise for Trump in changing his mind:\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, one of most powerful House Republicans whose father was vice president during the 9/11 attacks, said \u201cno member of the Taliban should set foot\u201d at Camp David. \u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d said Cheney, R-Wyoming, on Sunday. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) was less gracious:\n\nNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop. https://t.co/pagnRFuFtc \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) September 8, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post sees this as a food fight between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton. Bolton won this round, their sources claim, but Pompeo\u2019s winning the overall war, so to speak. Even with the cancellation of the Camp David meeting, Trump still plans to move forward on troop drawdowns, and the Camp David meeting was Trump\u2019s idea to get more concessions:\n\nBut others said that Trump was likely to move ahead with the planned initial withdrawal, regardless of the apparent collapse of negotiations. One official familiar with White House deliberations cast Trump\u2019s cancellation of the meeting \u2014 which the president said was in response to the death on Thursday of a U.S. soldier in a Taliban attack, one of 16 killed since the beginning of this year \u2014 as part of a broader victory for Bolton. Trump was the main person pushing for the Camp David meeting, according to a senior administration official who, like others who discussed the sensitive issue, spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Comparing the initiative to Trump\u2019s personal meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and his stated desire to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, this official said Trump thinks his personal style can persuade anyone, and that he has seen the possibility of a substantial Afghan withdrawal as a major plus for his reelection campaign. While many in the administration have questioned the Taliban talks, Pompeo and Bolton have been at loggerheads over this issue and others, with Bolton, a well-known hawk, charging that Pompeo was trying to \u201cbox him out\u201d of decision-making on Afghanistan. Bolton had expressed his reservations about the deal at the time Khalilzad briefed Trump on its terms in late August, according to the official familiar with White House deliberations.\n\nTrump\u2019s meetings with Kim and proposed meeting with Rouhani are controversial for arguably giving rogue state leaders more credibility as statesmen. At least those cases involved actual state leaders, however, and the need to head off nuclear proliferation in the hands of rogues. The Taliban are neither state leaders nor nuclear threats. Why would the president of the US meet with them at all? It\u2019s not diplomatically proportionate no matter where it takes place.\n\nHosting the Taliban at Camp David is not just diplomatically puzzling, it\u2019s politically nutty. Americans might be tired of fighting in a tribal war in which the Taliban/Pashtun cannot be defeated, but that doesn\u2019t mean Americans have forgotten 9/11 and the Taliban\u2019s role in it. The best analogy to 9/11 is Pearl Harbor, and the war that started came to an end with a surrender by Japan on an American carrier off their shoreline, negotiated by our military. We didn\u2019t invite Hirohito to Camp David for discussions. It\u2019s true that Camp David has been used as the venue for peace negotiations in the past, but not with an antagonist who helped facilitate the murder of 3,000 American civilians with attacks on our largest city and our capital.\n\nAnd scheduling it for the week of 9/11? That\u2019s so tone-deaf that it calls into question the competency of everyone involved in it. A Trump-Taliban summit at Camp David is a dumb idea on any date but especially this week. It\u2019s getting bipartisan backlash because it deserves bipartisan backlash. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s enough to convince the White House to take that page out of the playbook.", "description": "\"How about we end the war without inviting the Taliban to dinner on the week of 9/11?\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TrumpShrug.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
