However, the research group says the textbook suffers from liberal bias, pointing out that it:\n\n\u2981 Mentions Democratic presidents more frequently than Republican presidents.\n\n\u2981 Reduces President Nixon\u2019s tenure to the Watergate scandal and downplays his \u201csignificant legislative achievements,\u201d such as establishing the Environmental Protection Agency and opening U.S. relations with China.\n\n\u2981 Includes \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d and \u201cBeatniks\u201d in a section titled \u201cMakers of America,\u201d along with \u201cScientists\u201d and \u201cSuburbanites.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the American Pageant is a thoroughly unreliable narrator of U.S. history,\u201d says the report, which was written by Mr. Oliver, a former board member for National Review.\n\nThe report also notes an anti-Trump bias, saying the text refers to President Trump as a \u201cNew York City real estate mogul and reality-television personality\u201d who \u201cbullied, belittled, and bamboozled sixteen rivals to snag \u2014 some said hi-jack \u2014 the Republican nomination.\u201d\n\nThe report also objects to the textbook\u2019s language, which says Mr. Trump has a \u201ccavalier disregard for the facts\u201d and is a \u201cprince of plutocrats.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the textbook\u2019s publisher, Cengage, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJames Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, said in an email that the importance of textbooks is \u201coften overstated.\u201d\n\n\u201cA textbook is only a part of a student\u2019s education in history,\u201d Mr. Grossman wrote. \u201c[A]nd it\u2019s usually less important than the teacher.\u201d\n\nMr. Grossman wrote that the textbook\u2019s authors \u2014 David M. Kennedy, a former history professor from Stanford University, and Lizabeth Cohen, an American Studies professor at Harvard University \u2014 strive for \u201ccomprehensive coverage and synthesis of current scholarship.\u201d He also noted that texts reflect, inevitably, the authors\u2019 perspectives \u201cto some degree.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cengage\u2019s website, the American history textbook \u201cenjoys a reputation as one of the most popular, effective and entertaining resources for learning about American history.\u201d Cengage also touts the textbook\u2019s \u201ctrademark wit.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Research Institute\u2019s analysis focuses on characterizations of presidents, pointing out that while the text calls Democrat Woodrow Wilson a \u201clover of peace,\u201d while Republican Herbert Hoover is described as \u201cshy, standoffish, and stiff.\u201d Democrat Harry S. Truman is to have had a \u201cdown home authenticity,\u201d but Republican Theodore Roosevelt was an \u201cimperialistic busybody.\u201d\n\nWhile allegations of bias are rampant within liberal-leaning academia, historians generally have stood by their work. In 2018, many conservative media pounced on a tweet by a Minnesota high school student complaining that the book, \u201cBy the People: A History of the United States\u201d \u2014 harbored anti-Trump sentiments.\n\nIn a post to HistoryNewsNetwork.org, the book\u2019s author, historian James Fraser, wrote that the student was quoting from a passage detailing Hillary Clinton campaign supporters\u2019 critique of candidate Trump and deliberately omitted that Mr. Fraser had included Trump supporters\u2019 critique of Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\u201cI worry we could be entering a time in which students in some districts will read pro-Trump books and students in other districts will read anti-Trump books. We need to find ways to talk to each other across deep and real divides,\u201d Mr. Fraser wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
