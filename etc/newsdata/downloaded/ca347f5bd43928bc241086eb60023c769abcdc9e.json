Today, our expert pain series looks at back pain, which blights the lives of more than eight million Britons.\n\nUnderstanding your back pain begins with understanding your spine, a stack of 24 individual and nine fused bones, the vertebrae, supported by muscles and ligaments that help you stand, twist and bend.\n\nIn between each of the top 24 vertebrae is a cushioning disc. Its outer layer, the annulus fibrosus, is a tough ring, \u2018not unlike a car tyre\u2019, says Lee Breakwell, a consultant spinal surgeon at Sheffield NHS Foundation Trust. \u2018It\u2019s tough and semi-rigid but allows some movement.\u2019\n\nThe inner part, the nucleus pulposus, \u2018is like a jellybean full of rubbery protein\u2019, he adds. Down the back of the spine and behind these discs, running through space at the rear of each vertebrae, is the spinal cord, the bundle of nerves from which smaller branches of nerves connect all parts of the body to the brain.\n\nThe lowest five vertebrae of the spine, the lumbar vertebrae, is where the back is most flexible. But it is also where the most common form of back pain \u2014 lower back pain \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe cause can be anything from a simple muscle sprain to a series of abnormalities in the spine putting pressure on nerves. Just how and where that pain manifests depends on which nerve is being pinched or trapped, and by what. In most cases, however, the cause will remain a mystery.\n\nPain is the most common reason for a GP appointment and an estimated third to a half of all Britons live with daily pain\n\nWHAT TYPE OF PAIN DO YOU HAVE?\n\nMYSTERY LOWER BACK ACHE\n\nThe vast majority of lower back pain is \u2018non-specific\u2019 \u2014 the cause is unknown. This is because with so many muscles, ligaments, nerves and moving parts, the spine is an \u2018immensely complex structure that frequently keeps its secrets\u2019, says Laura Finucane, a consultant physiotherapist at NHS Sussex Musculoskeletal Partnership.\n\nThere could be a minor mechanical problem with one of the back bones or one of the cushioning discs that has put sudden pressure on a nerve. More likely, the pain has been triggered by lifting something heavy or otherwise sustaining an injury to one of the muscles in the back.\n\nOr it could just be down to bad posture, says Tim Allardyce, a physiotherapist and osteopath at the Surrey Physio clinic in Croydon. \u2018If you sit in a chair all day your back gets very stiff. Getting up and moving every half an hour might be enough to correct symptoms.\u2019\n\nFortunately lower back pain can disappear as quickly as it arrives. The NHS says 90 per cent of cases settle within six weeks.\n\nWhen to see a physio or doctor Up to 30 per cent of GP appointments are for musculoskeletal problems. Yet there\u2019s very little a GP can do for lower back pain apart from prescribe painkillers or refer you on, says Chris Mercer, a consultant physiotherapist at Western Sussex Hospitals Trust. That\u2019s why the NHS has been trialling specialist \u2018first contact practitioner\u2019 care at GP surgeries where you can book straight in with physiotherapists, osteopaths and chiropractors. Tens of thousands of people have already been treated this way. Up to 30 per cent of GP appointments are for musculoskeletal problems The NHS says pilot schemes show that faster treatment means faster recovery, with seven in ten patients discharged after only a single consultation, having been shown how to manage their condition. The trials have also seen a 12 per cent reduction in the prescription of pain medicine and a 21 per cent fall in referrals to hospital orthopaedic clinics.\n\nThe key to a speedy recovery, says Laura Finucane, is to keep active and get a good night\u2019s sleep. Anti-inflammatory painkillers, like ibuprofen, can help.\n\nOnly if a patient has the telltale symptoms of sciatica lower back pain accompanied by pain, tingling or numbness in the bottom, backs of the legs and feet, is it time for an MRI scan, says Mr Breakwell (see box on next page for scans and X-rays).\n\nDealing with back pain is a question of far more than massage or any other form of physical manipulation. \u2018This has to be done in combination with other measures, taking into account all aspects of a patient\u2019s life,\u2019 says Laura Finucane.\n\nA physiotherapist will also talk to the patient about their exercise, lifestyle, posture and sleep habits. \u2018Not sleeping well definitely ramps up your pain levels,\u2019 says Laura Finucane. Key risk factors associated with back pain are depression, being overweight and smoking. Posture is important, and patients are taught to sit correctly \u2014 avoiding hunching up.\n\nLosing weight can also help: a review of international studies published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2010 found that being overweight significantly increased the risk of back pain. Extra weight increases the load on the spine, while chronic inflammation associated with obesity may also trigger pain.\n\nAlthough many people with back pain are afraid to be active for fear of further damage, countless studies have shown exercise to be key to getting better.\n\nColin Natali, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with 16 years of NHS experience, who now works privately at the Schoen Clinic in Chelsea, London, has put a series of free videos of suitable exercises on YouTube (search \u2018uFixu\u2019).\n\nSurgery is possible, although rarely advised. The procedure is called a fusion, in which two vertebrae are joined with a bone graft. Screws or rods are used to hold the vertebrae together while they are fusing. This prevents the bones moving and causing pain by impinging on nearby nerves or muscles.\n\n\u2018This is about the only surgical intervention for back pain,\u2019 says consultant spinal surgeon Lee Breakwell. \u2018Unfortunately it works only about 50 per cent of the time and there is a high rate of reoperation, so we advise against it.\u2019\n\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends the operation is done only as part of a research trial. However, a study published in the journal BMJ Open last year found 4,500 spinal fusion operations are performed on the NHS every year.\n\nWellness journal tip - from Drs Chris & Xand van Tulleken To lose weight, cut 250 calories from your \u2018daily energy expenditure\u2019. Type the phrase into a search engine for a calculator to work yours out.\n\nARTHRITIC BONES\n\nFacet joint degeneration, normally caused by arthritis, is thought to be responsible for anything between 15 and 45 per cent of cases of lower back pain.\n\nEach vertebra has a pair of bony wings protruding at the rear that meet those of the vertebra below. These facet joints, and the cartilage that cushions them, can suffer wear and tear, leading to stiffness, localised pain and, if nerves are trapped, sciatica (pain running from the back, through the buttocks and down one or both legs).\n\nThe treatment is an injection of a combination of anaesthetic and steroids. Injected directly into the joint, this can reduce or stop the pain for weeks or even months \u2014long enough to allow the patient to follow an exercise programme that will bring longer-term relief.\n\nAlternatively, the injection may be given directly into the nerves supplying the joint. This too will relieve pain temporarily. However, the main purpose of these so-called \u2018medial branch blocks\u2019 is to see if the patient is a suitable case for radiofrequency denervation, in which an electric current is used to heat up and desensitise the nerves.\n\nStudies show this works for only about 60 per cent of people, who experience a reduction in their pain of between 50 and 80 per cent. The effect can last for anything from a few weeks to a couple of years.\n\nRed flags: five signs it is serious Very occasionally \u2014 in just 1.5 per cent of cases \u2014 back pain is a sign of something very serious. \u2018Severe back pain, pain down both legs, numbness at the bottom and genitals and difficulty passing urine could be cauda equina syndrome,\u2019 says Lee Breakwell, a consultant spinal surgeon in Sheffield. This is the compression of nerves in the spine that feed the legs, bladder, bowels and sexual organs. Mercifully rare, it can cause impotence, incontinence and paralysis \u2014 so should you suspect it, head straight to A&E. Sudden back pain over the age of 50 could be a compression fracture of the spine: This is usually caused by osteoporosis, an age-related weakening of the bones to which women are four times as prone. Back pain with fever could signal infection in the tissue surrounding the vertebrae, the discs or the dural sac that covers the spinal cord, which can result from an operation or occur spontaneously in patients who are diabetic, obese or have suppressed immunity. Pain with chronic tiredness could be myeloma \u2014 a rare blood cancer that can cause a spinal fracture that compresses nerves. Most patients learn they have it after being referred for spinal surgery. Very rarely, back pain can be a sign of a cancer returning and spreading to the spine.\n\nSLIPPED DISC\n\nIn medical parlance this is a prolapsed or herniated disc, but it adds up to the same thing \u2014 pressure on a nerve that can cause anything from mild pain to excruciating sciatica, which radiates down into the buttocks and legs.\n\nAs we grow older, the outer shell of the discs that separate our vertebrae ages too and starts to stiffen and crack. Eventually, the gel-like inner tissue may be squeezed out.\n\nIn itself, this isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, says Mr Breakwell. \u2018It\u2019s like your hair going grey as you age.\u2019 A degenerated disc may not cause pain \u2014 though common, \u2018slipped\u2019 discs account for only 5 per cent of lower back problems. What\u2019s more, a prolapsed disc will frequently repair itself.\n\nDon't take to your bed \u2018The idea that moving will make your back pain worse is a myth that endures,\u2019 says Lauren Connors, of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. \u2018It\u2019s true that some movements can be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s well established that returning to movement as soon as you\u2019re able to is better for recovery than bed rest.\u2019 In fact, taking to your bed makes matters worse as it quickly weakens the muscles and ligaments that support the spine. \u2018Often patients with back pain have tight muscles because they avoid certain movements,\u2019 adds Laura Finucane, a consultant physiotherapist at the NHS Sussex MSK Partnership. \u2018As a result they get stiffer and tighter, which all contributes to their back pain\u2019. Indeed, in the vast majority of cases of lower back pain, \u2018behaviours such as limping, protective muscle guarding and grimacing, are more reflective of fear and distress\u2019 than of injury, according to a major review in the journal Pain Management Today in 2014. Taking to your bed makes back pain worse as it quickly weakens the muscles and ligaments that support the spine Avoiding movement can leave patients \u2018feeling helpless and disabled\u2019 \u2014 and such \u2018catastrophic thinking\u2019 can make back pain worse. This is why modern treatment focuses on getting patients to exercise and make lifestyle changes. NICE guidance recommends patients with back pain be encouraged to continue with normal activities and even be referred to exercise programmes, including aerobics classes. \u2018Manual therapy\u2019, such as spinal manipulation or massage should be considered, \u2018but only as part of a treatment package including exercise\u2019.\n\nSciatica, which can be agonising, is one of the more obvious manifestations of a slipped disc.\n\nThe good news, says the Cochrane research group, is that 90 per cent of sciatica cases resolve with conservative management \u2014 including pain relief and lifestyle changes.\n\nSurgery is a last resort, says Mr Breakwell: \u2018Only if the pain is disabling, is surgery an option.\u2019\n\nThe operation is called a discectomy, in which the part of the disc that has bulged out is cut away. Studies have shown that this can give \u2018considerable\u2019 relief of pain in up to 90 per cent of patients.\n\nSQUEEZED NERVES\n\nA condition called stenosis may be responsible for lower back pain or sciatica.\n\nStenosis refers to any restriction of the spaces in the spine through which the nerves run, which can be caused by age-related bony growth or a thickening of the ligaments and other tissues to the point where they impinge on the nerves.\n\nAgain, exercise and physiotherapy are the first lines of defence.\n\nPatients who don\u2019t respond to conservative management may be offered epidural injections \u2014 a combination of local anaesthetic and steroids, a synthetic version of hormones produced by the adrenal glands, is injected into the spine.\n\nThe anaesthetic suppresses the pain and the steroids reduce inflammation, leaving the nerve numbed for up to three months.\n\n\u2018It gives the body time to heal and gives the patient a window to rehabilitate and get moving again,\u2019 says osteopath Tim Allardyce.\n\nThese injections work in about two-thirds of cases. Only if this fails is a sciatica sufferer likely to be offered surgery.\n\nIn an operation called a lumbar laminectomy, a section of bone at the back of a vertebra, the lamina, may be removed to relieve pressure. If necessary, a discectomy may also be performed to remove part of a slipped disc that is pressing on a nerve. A U.S. study in the journal Spine in 2012 compared the outcomes of hundreds of patients with sciatica who underwent any kind of decompression surgery with those who did not.\n\nAfter four years those who\u2019d had an operation reported \u2018substantially greater improvement in pain and function\u2019.\n\nSLIPPED VERTEBRA\n\nKnown as spondylolisthesis, this is when a vertebra slips out of position. \u2018It sounds alarming, but many people are walking around without knowing they have it,\u2019 says physiotherapist Laura Finucane.\n\nThere are four \u2018grades\u2019, relating to how far the vertebra has moved out of position, but even people with grade 4 may suffer no symptoms. Others may have lower back pain that\u2019s worse when standing, sciatica or curvature of the spine.\n\nSpondylolisthesis can be caused by degenerative changes to the spine in later life, or by trauma. Gymnasts or fast bowlers in cricket are particularly prone.\n\nIn many cases it can be managed with painkillers, exercise and physiotherapy, says Laura Finucane. If surgery is needed, it will involve fusing vertebrae.\n\nTo scan or not to scan\n\nWhile many patients seek an MRI scan, chances are spinal abnormalities they pick up won\u2019t be the cause of the pain\n\nMany patients seek an MRI scan, believing it will identify the cause of their pain.\n\nBut while a scan might pick up spinal abnormalities, chances are these won\u2019t be the cause of the pain. Most people\u2019s spines over the age of 40 show signs of degeneration, so a scan is highly likely to produce red herrings.\n\n\u2018I tell my patients that having a scan on your back is a bit like having a survey done on a house,\u2019 says physiotherapist Laura Finucane.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to throw up all sorts of things but actually those things probably aren\u2019t going to cause problems.\u2019\n\nMultiple studies have shown that if you scan a group of 50 to 60-year-olds who don\u2019t have back pain, half of the scans show abnormalities.\n\n\u2018So if you then scan 100 people who have got pain, how do you know the findings on their scans are relevant, when someone else who doesn\u2019t have pain has the same abnormalities?\u2019 asks consultant spinal surgeon Lee Breakwell.\n\nAre you seeing the right surgeon? Make sure you ask your surgeon how many of the operations they have done and what the results have been, advises consultant surgeon Lee Breakwell. He\u2019s one of a growing number of surgeons who contribute to the British Spine Registry, set up in 2012. \u2018The long-term aim of the Spine Registry is to improve patient care through a better understanding of the results of spinal surgery,\u2019 says David Bell of the British Association of Spinal Surgeons and a consultant spinal neurosurgeon at King\u2019s College Hospital, London. The association hopes to have 90 per cent of spinal operations recorded on the registry within the next three years, but currently only 25 per cent are. Patients can search by consultant or hospital name under \u2018neurosurgery\u2019 on the My NHS website, which shows how many spinal surgeries have been done by each hospital and each surgeon. The higher the number of operations carried out in any year, the more experienced that surgeon or hospital is.\n\nWhat a scan reveals and how much pain a patient is in \u2018have absolutely no correlation\u2019, confirms Arun Bhaskar, a consultant in pain medicine at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and president of The British Pain Society.\n\n\u2018You can have a pristine-looking spine yet have severe pain, or a spine that looks like it was run over by a train several times but you have no pain,\u2019 he says.\n\nThe consensus is that scans should not be used as an investigative tool, but only to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nIn fact, as well as rarely being necessary, MRI scans can make things worse because, as Laura Finucane explains, \u2018you end up worrying the patient unnecessarily\u2019.\n\n\u2018They think something terrible is happening to their back and then you see a downward spiral \u2014 they stop moving, lose flexibility and muscle tone and that can only add to their pain,\u2019 she says.\n\nA study of 246 patients with back pain and sciatica, published in the American Journal of Neuroradiology in 2008, found those given their MRI results did not improve as well as those not given them.\n\nX-rays are no more beneficial. In 2001 a study in The British Medical Journal of 421 patients who\u2019d had back pain for ten weeks or more showed conclusively that use of X-rays \u2018is not associated with improved patient functioning, severity of pain, or overall health status\u2019.\n\nHowever, it was \u2018associated with an increase in doctor work- load\u2019.\n\nWhat's the best pain relief?\n\nPainkillers should be a short-term proposition, says Arun Bhaskar, a consultant in pain medicine at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and president of The British Pain Society \u2014 and even then only as part of a programme designed to get you mobile again.\n\nThe drugs typically prescribed for back pain \u2014 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and prescription-only diclofenac and naproxen \u2014 can cause side-effects such as heartburn and even stomach ulcers, while long-term use of opioid drugs, such as codeine, can lead to addiction.\n\n\u2018If you go to your GP or to A&E with severe back pain, once they have ruled out something nasty, you are likely to be given some simple painkillers and, after a couple of days, you\u2019re on your way,\u2019 says Dr Bhaskar. \u2018You have to stay active. We see patients who are capable of walking without any aids, yet they were given a crutch temporarily five years ago and they are still using it.\u2019\n\nWhat about supplements? Dr Arun Bhaskar is relaxed when patients choose alternative remedies, such as \u2018natural\u2019 painkillers. \u2018The evidence base for a lot of these is very poor,\u2019 the pain medicine expert says. \u2018But if someone tells me it is helping them, and I\u2019m satisfied that it\u2019s not causing them harm, then I\u2019m OK with it.\u2019 A 2014 review by the Cochrane research group found that a large proportion of people with chronic lower back pain resort to complementary medicine. After reviewing 14 trials, the authors concluded that there was evidence, though often thin, for the effectiveness of six herbal treatments for lower back pain: Solidago chilensis (Brazilian arnica) in a gel. Capsicum frutescens (a chilli used in Tabasco sauce) in a topical cream or plaster.\n\nHarpagophytum procumbens (devil\u2019s claw root extract) as daily tablets. Salix alba (white willow bark) in a capsule. Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) used as an ointment. Lavender oil applied under pressure.\n\nLong-term, NSAIDs are not good for the stomach lining or the kidneys, and can increase the risk of stroke and heart disease. They also can\u2019t be taken with some other medicines. This is why the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the drugs should be given for lower back pain only \u2018at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period\u2019.\n\nShould that fail, \u2018then we are talking about opioids\u2019, says Dr Bhaskar. This may begin with weak opioids, such as codeine, possibly combined with paracetamol, available as co-codamol or co-dydramol.\n\nOpioids can cause constipation. More serious side-effects include addiction and problems with withdrawal.\n\nYet some studies have found that opioids are not even as effective for back pain as NSAIDs or paracetamol.\n\nMany patients Dr Bhaskar sees \u2018expect their problems to be fixed through medication, injections or surgery, and that belief flies in the face of what we recommend: that people with back pain need to be more active, more mobile, and look after their health\u2019, he says.\n\n\u2018In fact, studies suggest the incidence of back pain is higher in the desk-bound than people working with heavy objects.\u2019\n\nIf you find you aren\u2019t coping well with your pain, ask your GP for a referral to a pain clinic.\n\nPain specialists have other weapons in their armoury to use against back pain. These include:\n\nLumbar epidural: An injection into the epidural space at the back of the spine, through which the spinal cord runs. It combines an anaesthetic to numb pain and corticosteroids to reduce swelling. The injections are approved for severe sciatica, or \u2018radicular\u2019 pain \u2014 where pain from a trapped nerve radiates down the leg \u2014 when other treatments haven\u2019t worked.\n\nThe effects can last for up to a few months, during which time, it\u2019s important to keep exercising and working on your core stability to support your spine properly, says Dr Bhaskar.\n\nMedial branch block: These are diagnostic injections, used to determine whether long-term or recurring back pain is being caused by inflammation, injury or wear and tear \u2014 but they can also help pain.\n\nUsing X-rays or CT scans for guidance, a combination of local anaesthetic and steroids is injected close to one or more of the small \u2018medial branch\u2019 nerves that carry pain messages from the facet joints to the brain. If the patient\u2019s pain disappears, the guilty nerve has been found.\n\nThere are many options for helping to ease back pain - but painkillers should be a short-term proposition\n\nThis can also relieve pain for up to three months, and a study in the journal Spine in 2008 found that in half of cases this injection eased back pain for good.\n\nFacet joint injection: Similar to a medial branch block, except the local anaesthetic and steroid are injected directly into one of the joints.\n\nRadiofrequency denervation: This treatment can be offered for chronic lower back pain when other treatment hasn\u2019t worked, but a medial branch block has shown the source of pain is most likely to be a facet joint medial branch nerve.\n\nSpecial needles, guided by X-ray, are inserted alongside the nerve. A small electric current is passed through them, creating heat which destroys the ability of the nerve to transmit pain.\n\nStudies suggest this works in 60 per cent of cases, lasting for anything from a few months to a few years. NICE recommends it when back pain has lasted for longer than 12 weeks, despite treatment, and the source of pain is thought to be one of the medial branch nerves.", "description": "Pain is the most common reason for a GP appointment.Today, our expert pain series looks at back pain, which blights the lives of more than eight million Britons.", "authors": ["Jonathan Gornall For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/01/19182676-0-image-a-15_1569977767288.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
