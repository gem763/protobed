Banks can be \u201chighly prescriptive\u201d, he said, adding that the banks would be likely to say the same about the regulators.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of common sense by banks in their application of \u2018responsible lending rules,\u201d he added.\n\nSeparately, borrowers and mortgage brokers regularly complain that forensic analysis of applicants\u2019 spending and income had delayed loan applications.\n\nMr Samuel also said an online calculator recommended by the Productivity Commission will allow consumers to compare home loan rates. APRA, ASIC and Treasury in are discussions to try and have it up and running by next year.\n\nExisting comparison site providers claim they offer more than 7000 variations on hundreds of mortgages, compared to about 4000 mortgages and comparison being proposed by the regulators\u2019 scheme.\n\nMr Samuel said it was important to ensure there was no repeat of the problem that hit iSelect, which was criticised by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission for failing to disclose that it featured recommendations based upon business relationships.\n\nMr Samuel is a former chairman of the ACCC.\n\nComparison websites earn income from research, commission for directing borrowers to lender and advertising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut major website chiefs deny their recommendations are influenced by remuneration.\n\nSteve Mickenbecker, group executive for Canstar, said it offers 4000 home loans from 113 lenders.\n\n\u201cWe rate on value comparing the price and features of products and services to determine what represents overall value for consumers not just the cheapest option.\n\n\"We go to great lengths to carefully avoid any potential conflicts of interest between our commercial and research divisions,\u201d Mr Mickenbecker said.\n\nFinder\u2019s co-founder and director Frank Restuccia said: \u201cWe recognise that sometimes too much choice can lead to decision paralysis, so we curate leading offers in each category to help Australians make better decisions.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re constantly reviewing the site to make sure we\u2019re offering a great service and as rates and offers shift, we update our site accordingly.\u201d\n\nPaul Marshall, chief executive of RateCity, said he was \u201cnot confident\u201d an official comparison website could do any better.", "description": "Graeme Samuel has blamed problems with \u00a0mortgage competition on a combination of borrowers\u2019 \u201cinertia and apathy\" and said websites comparing home loan rates were freely available.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4441%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_165/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e01087d369085707c5f804e755bb1bb7391fe71b", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
