That\u2019s certainly what we expected when we first heard about John Wick Hex, but it\u2019s absolutely nothing like that. In actual fact it\u2019s a turn-based strategy game with terrible graphics\u2026 and one of the best games we\u2019ve played all year.\n\nJohn Wick Hex is the creation of British indie developer Mike Bithell, who\u2019s best known for experimental puzzle platformer Thomas Was Alone and the almost equally abstract Metal Gear-inspired Volume. It\u2019s hard to think of anyone less obvious to make a game about John Wick, but as he explained to us when we met him in June, the games division of film company Lionsgate were specifically looking for a developer to create something unusual and daring. And they certainly got that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you ask, unlike Cyberpunk 2077, Keanu Reeves is not in the game and the in-game character barely looks anything like him. Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick (Charon, the concierge), do provide voiceovers though, with the story framed in flashback as they\u2019re held captive to a new villain called Hex. Thankfully, the game doesn\u2019t delve too much into the film series\u2019 silly lore though and instead focuses on its renowned fight choreography.\n\nBithell may not have been able to involve Keanu Reeves but he did work extensively with the movies\u2019 director and fight team, and despite what you might think when you hear the phrase \u2018turn-based strategy\u2019 this is an impressively accurate recreation of how the fights work in the films. Bithell\u2019s initial idea was to make something along the lines of XCOM but when someone at Lionsgate pointed out that John Hex doesn\u2019t take turns an entirely new concept was devised where the whole game is broken down into steps that take a few tenths of a second each.\n\nTechnically the game isn\u2019t turn-based at all, as everything happens at the same time, as indicated by a timeline at the top of the screen that looks and works similar to the sort of thing you might see in video editing software. The game doesn\u2019t feature hexes either, or at least not in the traditional strategy sense, as instead a pattern of dots, reminiscent of Chinese chequers (which we\u2019ve just found out is actually German), is overlaid on the top-down view of your surroundings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou move by stepping from one point to another, the time taken to do so indicated on the timeline. Anything else you do is also shown, from picking up a weapon to firing your gun, and the same is true for any visible enemies \u2013 so that you can see what they\u2019re about to do as soon as they commit to the action. What follows is a glorious ballet of death, as you time your moves, including dodges, parries, and reloads, so that you\u2019re always in the right place at the right time to kill your enemies and avoid injury yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s a thick fog of war that hangs over every map, so you can\u2019t see anything unless it\u2019s in your direct line of sight, and so cover is more important in terms of you staying out of an enemy\u2019s eyeline than it is providing any protection to you. You have a focus bar, that is used up by dodging or more advanced melee combat, and that can only be replenished by pausing for a moment to reorientation yourself \u2013 which, along with applying a bandage or reloading, wastes precious seconds.\n\nDespite what you might fear none of this is very difficult to get the hang of and if anything the first hour or so seems worryingly easy. But then the game starts to take things seriously and you find yourself having to consider every single action with the upmost care. Although there\u2019s no mechanical similarity, John Wick Hex is reminiscent of Into The Breach in that every move counts and no matter how well you\u2019re doing a single mistake can mean almost instant failure.\n\nJohn Wick Hex (PC) \u2013 hopefully there\u2019ll be a console version later\n\nBy the time the game starts to get really hard you\u2019re absolutely sold on the whole idea and rather than other strategy games we ended up comparing it to the likes of Bayonetta or Devil May Cry, in terms of the balletic action you\u2019re orchestrating. With very few random elements you know that every time you lose it\u2019s entirely your fault and almost always because you\u2019re not paying proper attention to the timeline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we often found that\u2019s not because we forgot about it, so much as we were so caught up in the action we were taking moves too quickly, with the pace and urgency of an action game \u2013 even though you can sit there all day and ponder your next move if you really want to. We never did that, but we did learn to appreciate the challenge so much that we actively enjoyed being low on health and trying to complete a level without ever being hit (there are no saves mid-game).\n\nJohn Wick Hex is a fantastically enjoyable and impressively original game, but it\u2019s not without its faults. Although most of those are limited to its, frankly terrible, presentation. The graphics are awful, not only in terms of detail and animation, but in the way they can make it difficult to understand what\u2019s going on as you try to zoom in and rotate the camera to work out where everyone is and what they\u2019re doing.\n\nAnd while new enemy types and weapons are introduced as the game goes on, and there\u2019s a small number of buffs you can buy between missions, the gameplay doesn\u2019t really evolve that much over the course of the story. There are no civilians in locations such as a nightclub, that clearly had them in the films, and it\u2019s never clear whether sound is important. But these are minor niggles and a side effect of the obviously low budget. And even then the game still manages a few neat touches, such as the rain effects and the distant ping of a metal detector as an unseen enemy moves through it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this was a big budget game no doubt the graphics would have been vastly superior but there\u2019s no way anyone would have risked all that money on such an odd idea. But that risk has certainly paid off with John Wick Hex, which is not only one of the best movie tie-ins we\u2019ve ever played but one of the most original and enjoyable strategy games of the generation.\n\nJohn Wick Hex review summary In Short: One of the best movie adaptations of all time and an impressively original strategy game that manages to rival even the best action titles in terms of tension and adrenaline rush. Pros: Fantastically original gameplay that also manages to replicate the action of John Wick extremely accurately. Very accessible, even for strategy novices, and yet highly flexible combat. Cons: Ultra low-tech presentation can sometimes make it difficult to work out what\u2019s going and looks terrible in terms of the visuals. Gameplay doesn\u2019t evolve much as it continues.
