USA TODAY\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Amari Cooper was ready to confess his sin.\n\nThe \u201cworst three words in football,\u201d he called them.\n\nHe was describing his mindset on Dak Prescott\u2019s first interception, a play-action throw to Cooper down the middle of the field that ricocheted off the Cowboys receiver\u2019s hands before Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander snagged it and returned the pick 37 yards.\n\nCooper had thought to himself on the play: I got it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking, and those are the worst three words in football,\u201d Cooper said, eschewing praise for his career-high 226 receiving yards as he lamented the interception he felt he should have caught. \u201cI feel like I had it. It was an easy catch. Took my eyes off it because I was focused on the touchdown and I dropped it, and it created a turnover.\u201d\n\nDak Prescott to Amari Cooper intercepted by Jaire Alexander, who returns it 37 yards. Green Bay capitalizes.\n\n\n\nPackers 7, Cowboys 0pic.twitter.com/ia4EIR571u \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 6, 2019\n\nIt was the first of three turnovers the Cowboys would surrender in a 34-24 loss to Green Bay at home. It yielded the first of 31 straight points the Packers would score before the Cowboys took a ball home.\n\nThe Cowboys had several bright spots in their second-straight week coming up short, from the 563 yards of offense they compiled to a fourth quarter in which they outgained the Packers 146 yards to 14 and 12 first downs to three. But the offense that clicked near game\u2019s end and the defense that silenced Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones late failed to make those marks in three quarters that yielded a 31-3 deficit until 2:09 remained in the third.\n\n\u201cIt is a reality check,\u201d Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to win games in this league if we keep shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d\n\nMore: Cowboys owner Jerry Jones jokes about Jason Garrett's 'abusive language' penalty\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 5 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nIn the Cowboys' consecutive losses, Prescott has now accounted for five interceptions. The Cowboys run defense, meanwhile, allowed Aaron Jones to rush for four touchdowns \u2014 the most to any back in franchise history.\n\nA 21-point comeback in the last 18 minutes of the game \u2014 which could have been greater, as a penalty negated Brett Maher\u2019s made 28-yard field goal before he missed from 33 \u2060\u2014 left players and management with hope that the strengths that propelled the Cowboys team to 3-0 last month weren\u2019t a fluke.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my man,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones thought to himself as Prescott scrambled left for 14 yards, 2:45 to play, the Cowboys trailing by 10. \u201cThat\u2019s the competitor in him. \u2026 I thought, \u2018Boy, you have to kill him to get the competitor out of him.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut that approach and the roster's talent aren't enough to win games, Prescott said his team realized as the Packers outplayed them.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re a good team, and I\u2019m not taking that away or saying we\u2019re not,\u201d the quarterback said. \u201cI know we\u2019re a really, really good team. And we\u2019re confident in the players we have and confident in what we can do.\n\n\u201cBut sometimes, you have to know that it\u2019s the work that gets the wins. It\u2019s not the talent. It\u2019s not the camaraderie. It\u2019s the work.\u201d\n\nMore: Sky is suddenly the limit for Packers' offense after breakout win vs. Cowboys\n\nMore: Packers' defense brings heat on Cowboys' Ezekeil Elliott, Dak Prescott after focusing on fundamentals\n\nThat message permeated throughout a surprisingly steady losing locker room.\n\nSure, Jones, coaches and players were all disappointed that the performance for most of the game fell short of what they needed to win. But they left the field motivated by their comeback attempt and inspired by teammates\u2019 accountability for the slew of miscues.\n\nTake Cooper honing in on the interception he tipped rather than his receiving output.\n\n\u201cAmari saying that, I think, is an example of guys in the locker room,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cA lot of guys on our team look in the mirror before they point fingers.\n\n\u201cAs long as we have those type of guys on our team, we\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d\n\nIn all likelihood, reversing their fortunes will take a more consistent performance throughout games. It will take surer tackling with running threats like Le\u2019Veon Bell, Sony Michel and Todd Gurley ahead on the schedule. It will take much better ball security from Prescott, who Jones insisted is \u201crenowned for his ability to protect the ball,\u201d though he added \u201cthe turnover thing alone really puts you behind the eight ball.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cthe best thing for me tonight,\u201d Jones continued, is that \u201cour team didn\u2019t understand right at the end of the game, in the last two minutes, three minutes, that they couldn\u2019t win this game. \u2026 We\u2019ve got a spirit that really is encouraging.\u201d\n\nNow the Cowboys must implement that spirit, and those inconsistent bursts of competitiveness, across all four quarters of each game. Before visiting the Jets next week, they\u2019ll look in the mirror to do just that, players said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily have to have our backs against the wall to play like we did [late],\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out whatever it is, find out the way or whatever it is to start the game like that.\n\n\u201cWhen we find that, it\u2019s going to be dangerous.\u201d\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
