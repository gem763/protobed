REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French energy major Total said on Wednesday that record production growth in the third quarter help keep its cash flow steady, as adjusted net profit tumbled due to lower oil and gas prices.\n\nProduction rose 8.4% to a record output in a quarter at over 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with the same period last year. Total said it was on track to hit 9% output growth this year.\n\n\u201cThe group continues to achieve solid results despite a third-quarter environment compared to a year ago that was marked by an 18% decrease in the Brent price to $62 per barrel and gas prices that fell by about 55% in Europe and Asia,\u201d Total\u2019s CEO Patrick Pouyanne, said in a statement.\n\nTotal\u2019s debt-adjusted cash flow fell 2% to $7.4 billion, while adjusted net profit slumped 24% to $3.02 billion compared with the same quarter in 2018.", "description": "French energy major Total said on Wednesday that record production growth in the third quarter help keep its cash flow steady, as adjusted net profit tumbled due to lower oil and gas prices.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446443562&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0EC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
