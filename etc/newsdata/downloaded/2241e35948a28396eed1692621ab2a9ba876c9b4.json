The device records data about the testicles' temperature; the time of use; as well as the type of activity (sleep, sitting work, physical activity) by sending it to a mobile application in the phone.\n\nIn November, at the TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin conference, Dorota Partyka, Project Manager Cooltec, said the device was currently undergoing medical trial testing.\n\nCosting between R4,300 and R5,700, Partyka recommends it should be worn for 12-16 hours for up 3-4 weeks to see results.\n\nThe data can then be analyzed by an andrologist to increase the effectiveness of the treatment process offering a non-invasive alternative to infertility treatment.\n\n\n\nInfertility has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a social disease.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "It's to help with one of the main causes of male infertility.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8340/5c209835dff34a478584e50bbe504be9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-04"}
