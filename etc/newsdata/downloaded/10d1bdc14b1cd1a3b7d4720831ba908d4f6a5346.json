It\u2019s vice versa \u2014 \u2018Come on, I will take this penalty kick, nobody else!\u2019 Auba gave the chance to Pepe. His instinct was, \u2018Let\u2019s score and let\u2019s go forward together.\u2019 He takes care about his team-mates.\n\n\u2018Since he joined Arsenal, he played where he was asked and needed, and so he helped especially Lacazette to adapt to the Premier League.\n\n\u2018Maybe this attitude costs him to play for clubs like Real Madrid or Barcelona but maybe they made a mistake not to go for him. I like his mindset. It is good for a team\u2019s atmosphere.\u2019\n\nMORE: Why Unai Emery is not selecting Mesut Ozil for Arsenal\n\nMORE: Raul Sanllehi backs Unai Emery decision to axe Mesut Ozil from Arsenal squad", "description": "Arsenal's former head of recruitment Sven Mislintat believes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's selfless attitude ultimately will cost him the opportunity to play for either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
