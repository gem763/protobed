'Necrotising' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. There are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year, but 20 to 25 percent of victims die.\n\nShe was only released from Kettering General Hospital yesterday, and must return every 24 hours to get antibiotics.\n\nA spokesman for Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it was 'very sorry' to hear about Ms Gurney's experience.\n\nThe trust told the Sun it will be in contact with Ms Gurney, and is keen to discuss 'how her infection might have been caused'.\n\nIt is not the first time this month that a new mother has claimed to have caught the same bacterial infection after having a C-section.\n\nKrista Parise, 32, from New York, last week claimed she was left just 24 hours away from death after having the emergency procedure.\n\nDoctors found she had contracted a bacterial infection during her emergency C-section, which then led to the life-threatening NF.\n\nShe was allowed home two days after giving birth to Sal. However, she woke up the following day with a fever.\n\nHer gynaecologist sent her away - but her fever only became worse. Ms Parise then developed an excruciating pain in her stomach, which was 'hot to touch'.\n\nIt became so bad that the Mercedes saleswoman struggled to walk, which left her bed-bound and in need of her mother's help to care for Sal.\n\nMs Parise developed pus-filled blisters on her scar, which she claimed smelled 'so bad' that she thought it came from 'the homeless people'.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape.\n\nAs the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.\n\nSymptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea.\n\nSufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue.\n\nAmputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg, doctors say.", "description": "Claire Gurney, from Kettering in Northamptonshire, said her stomach became hard and black just two days after giving birth.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19599744-0-image-a-37_1570812840552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
