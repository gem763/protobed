I would rather be English!", "language": "en", "text": "If France's players heed the call for another mid-tournament mutiny, they have a blueprint to follow, \u2014 Thierry Dusautoir and his squad staged a textbook coup eight years ago.\n\nThe 37-year-old former flanker is the all-time Gallic World Cup icon.\n\nHe captained his country at the 2011 and 2015 showpiece events, and put together a majestic performance against the All Blacks in 2007, when his try and a record 38 tackles inspired France to victory over the favourites in an epic quarter-final.\n\nWith the France squad in turmoil again, Thierry Dusautoir revealed all about his side's coup\n\nIn 2011 there was a mutiny under coach Marc Lievremont (left) by Dusautoir and Co\n\nFour years later, he led France to the World Cup final, where they lost by just a point to hosts New Zealand in Auckland. Dusautoir was man of the match and scored his team's only try.\n\nHe was subsequently named World Player of the Year.\n\nHis experiences in 2011 have echoes now, ahead of the latest instalment of 'Le Crunch' on Saturday. Then, there was division and disharmony in the France squad \u2014 and there are rumours that history is repeating itself, with captain Guilhem Guirado reportedly out of favour with head coach Jacques Brunel.\n\nThen, France lost to Tonga in the pool stage. Here, they narrowly avoided a shock against the same Pacific Island opponents last Sunday.\n\nThe rebellion which saw head coach Marc Lievremont become marginalised in New Zealand eight years ago has become part of rugby folklore.\n\nThe flanker led his side heroically and they almost beat New Zealand in the World Cup final\n\nDusautoir revealed what really happened, saying: 'The day after the game against Tonga, the guys organised, how should I say it\u2026 'beer therapy'.\n\n'We were in Wellington and the beer therapy was on the top floor of the hotel. It was not about the alcohol though, we just needed to say what we were really thinking.\n\n'We hadn't been one big group of 30 players \u2014 we had been lots of little groups, criticising each other. So everybody said, 'Right, we've got to get our s*** together'.\n\n'It could have been a disaster but, for us, it was a solution. When we started to talk like this, it was quite hard, but you need these things to come out.\n\n'We decided, from that moment on, we have to be in charge. We said we are not just going to do what the coach tells us to do, we are going to do what we want to.\n\n'Different players took charge of the scrum, the lineout, the defence and the attack. We decided how we wanted to play and put all our energy into this.\n\n'It was very simple and easy to understand, so we could focus on the fight. We didn't have much time. Only six days. I was in charge of the defence with David Ellis (the English coach). We built up something together.'\n\n'Beer therapy' helped the France squad heal their internal wounds and they reached the final\n\nFrance certainly did build up something. A week after losing to Tonga, they knocked England out of the World Cup, with a shock 19-12 victory at Eden Park.\n\n'Everyone said we were going to lose,' said Dusautoir. 'But we are French! We played a great game. We had nothing to lose and when you have nothing to lose, you are dangerous as a team.'\n\nThat result was a launchpad. With a bond forged by their beer therapy and their momentous coup, France beat 14-man Wales in the last four to earn a place in the final against the All Blacks, who were struggling with the burden of host-nation expectation.\n\nOnce again, Dusautoir and his side were written off. So, amid a mood of us-against-the-world defiance, France decided to antagonise New Zealand, by advancing towards the Haka before kick-off. The captain made his men aware of what they were letting themselves in for, by ignoring the modern convention of standing respectfully still to accept the challenge.\n\n'At first, I didn't want to do this,' said Dusautoir. 'I didn't want to just do something for the cameras. We had to be all-in, because after this, there will be trouble! You have to be ready to pay the price.\n\n'The night before the final, I spoke to the official who is with you during the World Cup (team liaison officer). He was half Kiwi and half French. I asked him how we could respond to the Haka.\n\nDusautoir and Dave Ellis (right) worked out a simple game plan for the defence\n\nFrance responded to the haka in an arrow formation and showed unity before the game\n\n'He told me in the army they have an arrow formation, which means you are going to go through the enemy. He said, 'You have to move forward when they do the Haka'. I said we would do it.\n\n'So, when the All Blacks did their Haka, we stood in the shape of an arrow and I was at the point of the arrow. When I made the first step forward, the other players moved up so we were in a line. The message was, \"We are ready for you. Maybe you are going to win, but you're going to have a hard day\".'\n\nIt was a message which resonated that night, as France outplayed the All Blacks and would have fully deserved to win the final, only to be edged out. It also demonstrated the positive side of the national rugby stereotype \u2014 the unpredictability which Dusautoir regards as a curse. You know the age-old cliche. Nobody knows what to expect from the French. They veer between triumph and disaster, sometimes in quick succession, with no obvious explanation.\n\nThey deliver epic miracles and miserable surrenders. Why? It's still a mystery \u2014 and a frustration to Dusautoir. 'This is being French,' he said. 'I hate this part of us. I would like to be an English guy this way. What we know about the English is that they will play at their best level.\n\nThe ex-captain understands as well as anyone the infuriating unpredictability of the French\n\nThe World Cup evaded the French but it was typically Gallic to perform against the odds\n\n'We take the level of our opponent, so if we play a small team, we play small rugby. If we play a big team, we play big rugby. When no one expects us to play well, we give our best because that is just in our nature.'\n\nThere it is, that familiar stereotype. Just when France are expected to fall flat, they could touch the stars \u2014 to shunt England down into second place in Pool C and condemn them to a quarter-final against Wales. Eddie Jones and his players must be on guard for the danger of France delivering that 'big rugby' they are capable of.\n\nDusautoir will relish the next clash with the cross-Channel foes. He admires the English, even if he has sometimes allowed himself to engage in the 'theatre' of the rivalry. 'We love being enemies on the pitch and the public likes it too,' he said. 'Sport is about emotion and when you build up this kind of rivalry, it becomes emotional, win or lose.\n\n'I don't hate the English. I would say that I let myself play my role in the theatre, the show, when it was France against England. But I've always had respect for English players.'\n\nDusautoir also admires English rugby's ability to promote young, homegrown talent for the good of the national team \u2014 a system which he laments the absence of in France. He pointedly notes the work done by Jones's predecessor to create a platform for recent prosperity.\n\nDusautoir (right) and Les Bleus upset England before beating Wales in the semi-final\n\nThe 37-year-old thinks Stuart Lancaster laid the foundations upon which England are thriving\n\n'England didn't have the results they wanted in 2015, but they had moved forward,' he said.\n\n'Stuart Lancaster did a great job. I remember people were saying, \"He's not a good coach\", but I'm not so sure. It's true that Eddie Jones is a top coach, but he has enjoyed Lancaster's work, too. Look at all these guys who are playing now. They are here because England started to build again when Lancaster was coach.'\n\nOn Saturday, Dusautoir is adamant that England are clear favourites. But as he knows, the French rugby stereotype often chases logic out of town.\n\n'If I look at it in an objective way, France have no chance to win against England,' he said.\n\n'If I look at the metrics, there is no chance. But it is not just about metrics. When you are a French team, you are against England and everyone says you will lose, crazy things can happen.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: If France's players heed the call for another mid-tournament mutiny, they have a blueprint to follow.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19463944-0-image-a-22_1570571140010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
