But some e-cigarette users are also trying to quit \u2014 including those who use Juul, the sleek but highly concentrated nicotine vape pen popular among teens.\n\nHouse lawmakers in July questioned Juul Labs co-founder James Monsees over the company\u2019s role in what the previous Food and Drug Administration commissioner dubbed an \u201cepidemic of addiction\u201d among teenagers. \u201cWe never wanted any non-nicotine user, and certainly nobody underage, to ever use Juul products,\u201d Monsees said. \u201cYet the data clearly shows a significant number of underage Americans are doing so. This is a serious problem. Our company has no higher priority than fighting it.\u201d\n\nApproximately 1.5% of high-school students used e-cigarettes in 2011, but that percentage rose to 20.8% in 2018, according to the CDC.\n\nNow health officials have linked a vaping-related lung illness sweeping the country to three deaths and a reported 450 suspected or confirmed cases, according to NBC News. The New York State Department of Health also announced Thursday that it had found high levels of the supplement vitamin E acetate, in cannabis-containing vape products submitted for testing.\n\n\u201cWhile this investigation is ongoing, people should consider not using e-cigarette products,\u201d the CDC said Friday. \u201cPeople who do use e-cigarette products should monitor themselves for symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever) and promptly seek medical attention for any health concerns.\u201d\n\nTeens also testified in a hearing that a Juul representative had once claimed to ninth-grade students that the USB-shaped device was \u201ctotally safe.\u201d The e-cigarette company called the presentation part of a \u201cshort-lived Education and Youth Prevention Program\u201d discontinued last September \u201cafter its purpose \u2014 to educate youth on the dangers of nicotine addiction \u2014 was clearly misconstrued.\u201d\n\nCost is also an issue\n\nE-cigarettes are not cheap. Dave Dobbins, the chief operating officer of Truth Initiative, an anti-tobacco nonprofit, says his organization has heard from plenty of kids who say they spend $50 a month on Juul pods, and has even heard of monthly tabs running into the hundreds. Because online buyers must be 21 or older, teens often buy the product \u2014 whose 5% nicotine pods sell for $15.99 per four-pack \u2014 at inflated resale rates. One pod is supposed to last around 200 puffs.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working part-time at a pizza place, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Dobbins said. \u201cOne of the things we talk about with kids is, \u2018Is this really where you want to spend your money?\u2019\u201d\n\nTeen use has soared\n\nSome 1.5% of high-school students used e-cigarettes in 2011, but that percentage rose to 20.8% in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and increased from 0.6% to 4.9% among middle schoolers over the same period. High schoolers\u2019 e-cigarette use shot up by 78% between 2017 and 2018 alone, while middle-schoolers\u2019 use increased 48% \u2014 a trend likely due to \u201cthe recent popularity of e-cigarettes shaped like a USB flash drive, such as JUUL,\u201d the CDC suggested.\n\nJuul, whose pods come in flavors like mango and mint and can contain roughly one pack of cigarettes\u2019 worth of nicotine, became a teen favorite in part because of its range of appealing flavors and the ease of using it without parents\u2019 knowledge, said Donna Shelley, a professor of population health and medicine at the NYU School of Medicine.\n\nThe ease of delivery, amount of nicotine per pod, and frequency with which young people can now use the product \u201call add up to a product that is leading to a new epidemic of nicotine addiction among youth,\u201d Shelley told MarketWatch.\n\nThere\u2019s concern that e-cigarettes, which are not FDA-approved as a smoking-cessation aid, could serve as a gateway to cigarette smoking.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201csuper discreet,\u201d Dobbins said. \u201cYou can use it all the time: in school, in your bedroom, in the middle of the night, when you wake up.\u201d\n\nJuul Labs did not return a MarketWatch request for comment on the product\u2019s addictiveness, particularly among teens.\n\nE-cigarettes are \u201cabsolutely less harmful than combustible tobacco,\u201d Shelley said, and there\u2019s increasing evidence that they can help people quit smoking cigarettes. (Results have been mixed.)\n\nBut there\u2019s still concern that e-cigarettes, which are not FDA-approved as a smoking-cessation aid, could serve as a gateway to cigarette smoking, Shelley said. A JAMA Network Open study published in February concluded that \u201ce-cigarette use is associated with increased risk for cigarette initiation and use, particularly among low-risk youths.\u201d Cigarette smoking is, of course, the top risk factor for lung cancer.\n\n\u201cUsing nicotine in adolescence can harm the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control,\u201d the CDC adds. \u201cEach time a new memory is created or a new skill is learned, stronger connections \u2014 or synapses \u2014 are built between brain cells. Young people\u2019s brains build synapses faster than adult brains. Nicotine changes the way these synapses are formed.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to kick your e-cigarette or Juul habit, you\u2019re not alone: Research shows that a majority of e-cigarette users want to quit.\n\nSome 63% of Juul users in a 2018 Truth Initiative study were unaware that the product always contained nicotine, according to a 2018 study.\n\nHere are strategies that can help, according to experts:\n\nGet informed. Some 63% of Juul users in a 2018 Truth Initiative study were unaware that the product always contained nicotine. On the flip side, a JAMA Network Open study this year found that the share of U.S. adults perceiving e-cigarettes to be just as harmful as or more harmful than cigarettes rose \u201csubstantially\u201d between 2012 and 2017.\n\nFind a support system. If you\u2019re a light user, quitting cold turkey and/or quitting with a support group could be the best option, Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told MarketWatch. For heavier users, however, it may not be so easy.\n\nGet access to an online community in which people support one another, share tips and success stories, and acknowledge that quitting can take multiple attempts, Dobbins added. This kinship among users who are trying to quit together \u201cgives a sense of community and bolsters your ability to quit,\u201d he said.\n\nQuit by text. The Truth Initiative\u2019s free text-message tool launched this year as a resource for young e-cigarette and Juul users trying to quit. (Text DITCHJUUL to 88709.) The program, which uses input from young adults who have quit or tried to quit using e-cigarettes, gives age-appropriate tips and support leading up to a target quit date, providing an \u201cinstant boost\u201d whenever the user texts \u201cCRAVE,\u201d \u201cSLIP\u201d or \u201cSTRESS.\u201d The tool also integrates with the Truth Initiative\u2019s digital quit programs This Is Quitting and BecomeAnEx.\n\nIf you\u2019re a moderate user, try nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) like nicotine gum, lozenges or skin patches, Glantz said. But while many NRTs can be obtained over the counter, Glantz warns they should still be used in conjunction with counseling, as research suggests they aren\u2019t effective on their own. \u201cThe studies very consistently show that the counseling is crucial,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emotional-support part of this is very, very important.\u201d You can access those resources through SmokeFree.gov or state quitlines, many of which offer free NRT, he said.\n\nFor a more severe addiction, see your health-care provider. They may recommend a prescription medication like varenicline (brand name Chantix PFE, +0.44% ) or bupropion (brand names Zyban GSK, -0.02% , Wellbutrin or Aplenzin BHC, +2.12% ) to help you quit, Glantz said. \u201cThose are more potent prescription drugs that are appropriate for people who are more seriously addicted,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to start with those.\u201d Medications should also be used alongside counseling. And as always with such drugs, read the potential side effects carefully.\n\nWork to change your behaviors. People come up with their own plans, but many have the same overarching themes, Shelley said, including trying to make the act unpalatable and making sure they have alternative behaviors that are satisfying and fulfill that need.\n\nStrategies might include chewing on gum, cinnamon sticks or candy to keep your mouth busy; learning to anticipate which people, situations and emotions trigger use; working to wait out the ebb and flow of cravings; and creating a plan for the tough times, Shelley said.\n\n\u201cSome of it is really just having something to put in your mouth,\u201d she said. \u201cOther times it\u2019s more about having someone to talk to or positive thinking.\u201d Another tip: Keep e-cigarettes out of your home and try to steer clear of people who use them, Shelley added, though the latter could be difficult if they\u2019re popular among your peer group.\n\nDon\u2019t lose hope. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, even if you don\u2019t succeed on the first try, to keep trying,\u201d Glantz said. \u201cA lot of people relapse, and you just need to keep trying until you succeed.\u201d", "description": "\u2018While this investigation is ongoing, people should consider not using e-cigarette products,\u2019 the CDC said Friday.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO271_juul_ZG_20190726171829.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
