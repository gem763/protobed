The charges against Nissan, Ghosn and Greg Kelly, the other ex-Nissan executive charged with financial crimes, don\u2019t offer specifics, and their trial isn\u2019t due to start until next year. Ghosn also faces charges in Japan related to money flows in the Middle East.\n\nIn the SEC settlement, Nissan was fined $15 million over the allegations, while Ghosn, 65, was hit with a $1 million penalty, the SEC said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe are pleased to have resolved this matter in the U.S. with no findings or admission of wrongdoing,\u201d Ghosn\u2019s defense team said, adding that they will \u201cvigorously fight the criminal case in Japan and pursue his claims against Nissan around the world.\u201d\n\nNissan, based in Yokohama, said in a statement that it cooperated fully with the SEC.\n\nEven so, the SEC\u2019s complaint offers the clearest picture yet of some of the alleged methods used by Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan to hide compensation and payments made to the fallen auto titan. Here are some of key details:\n\nDisclosure Rules Changes\n\nBecause of an impending change in Japan\u2019s disclosure rules in 2009 for corporate directors, \u201cGhosn became concerned about criticism that might result in the Japanese and French media if his total compensation became publicly known,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nEvery year from 2011, a senior employee \u201cwould prepare for Ghosn\u2019s approval a document summarizing Ghosn\u2019s total fixed compensation, his paid compensation that was being disclosed, and his remaining compensation that was not paid and was not being disclosed,\u201d the complaint said. About $94 million of Ghosn\u2019s undisclosed compensation was determined in this manner, the agency said.\n\nPayout Methods\n\nIn order to pay out the undisclosed compensation, \u201cGhosn and his subordinates sought multiple ways to pay his undisclosed compensation through Nissan-related entities without disclosure,\u201d the complaint said. While they considered paying this out using Nissan subsidiaries, they instead decided to postpone the payments for a later undisclosed date, according to the agency.\n\nThe total remuneration, paid remuneration and postponed remuneration were tracked each year in a spreadsheet, according to the SEC. A Nissan employee \u201cshowed or provided to Ghosn the reports he prepared each fiscal year to set Ghosn\u2019s total, paid, and postponed compensation, as well as the spreadsheets he maintained and updated each year that tracked the same information,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nNew Payout Plan\n\nAnother plan to pay out the undisclosed compensation emerged in 2013, when Ghosn and his subordinates sought to use Nissan\u2019s long-term incentive plan to release cash to the former chief executive officer, according to the SEC. Although Ghosn hadn\u2019t participated previously in the incentive plan, an employee of the automaker prepared backdated letters that granted Ghosn compensation under the plan for the amount of undisclosed agreed-upon compensation.\n\n\u201cThe backdated LTIP award letters were intended to ensure Ghosn would receive payment on the postponed compensation that had been omitted from Nissan\u2019s director compensation disclosures,\u201d the complaint said. The funding for the plan\u2019s payments came from a pool of money called the CEO Reserve, and in order for the chief financial officer to sign off on the payments, he was \u201cfalsely told that the LTIP awards were a broad-based grant to numerous Nissan participants rather than that the vast majority was for Ghosn and included exchange rate protection on the inflated retirement allowance,\u201d the document said.\n\nBoosted Retirement\n\nSeparately, Ghosn used another method to increase his compensation: boosting his retirement allowance by more than $50 million, according to the SEC. Ghosn and his subordinates backdated retirement award letters in order to increase his compensation, and then sought to make the changes in accounting record, the agency said. Because the increase in retirement would have to be made public, they decided to make the changes by saying it was miscalculation, the SEC said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nissan Motor Co. and Carlos Ghosn offers a rare glimpse into the steps that were taken to make sure more than $140 million paid to the ex-chairman wasn\u2019t disclosed publicly.That\u2019s because many of the claims against Nissan and", "authors": ["Reed Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vHSIrpt_VvbLZvAFFeMKZA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/afecec9fbc08ff7c9955108d2ec128d7"}
