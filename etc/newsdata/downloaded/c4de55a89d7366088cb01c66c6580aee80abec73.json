She's told him all these things and that he needs to forgive himself and all of that but it's all been caught up in the death.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"He has to now unpick all of that and take all the meaning and the messages from what she was saying to him and actually apply them.\n\n\n\n\"But the trauma and the shock of it, you kind of get away from that as quickly as possible. So there will be, but it will take a bit of time to implement it.\"\n\n\n\n*Sinead's final scenes air on Coronation Street for half an hour on Thursday 24 October and Friday 25 October for an hour", "description": "Daniel Osbourne will be caught passionately kissing Bethany Platt just days before wife Sinead Tinker's death, leaving his family disgusted", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Pa", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580906.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Coronation-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
