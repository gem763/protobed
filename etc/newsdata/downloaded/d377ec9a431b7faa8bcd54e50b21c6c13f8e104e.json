I was in a bad mood, days overdue on my health-insurance payment and months overdue on breaking up with someone. Reasons why my life was a mess kept coming at me, like the flying saucers in Asteroids, the only video game I\u2019ve ever played. I was 43 and a half, and I was panicking about my life as if I were stoned. I wasn\u2019t.\n\nI hadn\u2019t heard anyone coming because in addition to freaking out, I was listening to \u201cErotic City\u201d at full volume. I whirled around. I was looking at one of the handsomest men I\u2019d ever seen, certainly the handsomest man who\u2019d ever gone out of his way to get my attention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the extremely handsome man said. \u201cI kept shouting your name, but you didn\u2019t hear me, so I ran to catch up with you!\u201d\n\nHis name was Tor. I had met him briefly years before, and when I had recently been introduced to his cousin, I told her, \u201cOh, yeah, I know your cousin. He\u2019s hot.\u201d This had obviously made its way back to him, as I must have intended. We stood in the street and talked. Then we stood on the steps of the coffee place I was about to enter and talked, then we went inside and talked in the vestibule. Later, he told me that I seemed like I felt cornered, which is proof that you can\u2019t always tell whether someone is interested in you. What I was actually thinking was, \u201cWOW,\u201d but also, \u201cSo young.\u201d I thought, This would be perfect, but it will never happen.\n\nBut it did happen. Tor wrote me an instant message on Facebook, and a few minutes into our chat, I called the other guy and broke up with him. \u201cI met someone else,\u201d I said, even though I had done literally nothing more.\n\nHe was 33. I almost died of happiness every time I saw him. I couldn\u2019t believe a person this attractive and this smart and this nice existed and that we actually liked each other. I realized that I had never really liked 95 percent of the people I had dated. Though I didn\u2019t believe in soul mates and still don\u2019t, I finally understood what people meant when they talked about really loving someone and feeling close to them. I had always thought of men as these sort of things that, if you were straight and wanted to have sex, you just sort of had to contend with. Tor was like an actual person.\n\nBut also an actual young person. People say age is just a number, yet this truth glosses over the fact that number refers, rather crucially, to the number of years one has been alive. I became hyperaware that I was, whether I liked it or not, a cougar, and I began to see other cougars everywhere: an acquaintance whose boyfriend was 14 years younger, a writer I knew slightly whose husband was 18 years younger \u2026 My mother told me that one of her grandmothers had been was 15 years older than her grandfather. Then there were (at the time) my famous sisters in cougarhood and their cubs: Sam Taylor-Johnson and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (24 years apart); J.Lo and Casper Smart (17 years); Gabrille Union and Dwyane Wade (ten years); Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon (ten years). A month into our relationship, Tor turned 34, and it actually seemed significant to me that for six months, we\u2019d be less than a decade apart. Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore\u2019s (15 years) divorce became final after we\u2019d been together for six months or so, and when I read the announcement on \u201cPage Six,\u201d I felt physically ill. It seemed like scientific proof we would break up too.\n\nIt\u2019s considered an older man\u2019s right to date younger women and also just an inevitable result of biology. No one gives a shit about a man going out with a woman who is ten years younger. But a woman who goes out with a man ten years younger would be described as having \u201cscored\u201d or \u201cgotten her hands on him.\u201d It\u2019s odd, because there\u2019s admiration in people\u2019s reactions to a woman dating young: The cougar is courageous; it takes the best of what\u2019s available, which of course means young flesh. There\u2019s something inherently feminist about being a cougar in America, where feminism is just agreeing on whatever the patriarchy sees as valuable and then simply making those things the property of women rather than of men.\n\nThe cougar is also sad, because to get what it wants, it must hunt. No one hunts the cougar.\n\nWhile not everyone commented on our age difference, most people did. \u201cRobbing the cradle!\u201d they liked to say, or \u201cBagged yourself a young stud there.\u201d Excuse me, I wanted to say, who tapped whom on the shoulder? I was supposed to laugh, but zero percent of me felt like \u201cYou know it, bitch, high five\u201d about this situation, so I would just stare at people or make a noise that I hoped sounded like laughter and not a welp. They would not have wanted to hear my potential responses, which included: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure this is all hilarious to you insofar as you even care, but, FYI, I have never before in my life felt so loved or loved another person who deserved it so much, and I am so afraid of losing it I feel like I am going to be sick all the time,\u201d or \u201cThank you for your clever observations regarding the number of years between the birthdates of me and the man I love,\u201d or \u201cAs much as this is joyful relationship, there is a corresponding misery because while everything about us tells me we should be together, the pressure of social norms makes it extremely unlikely, and if you looked into my eyes right now instead of at your phone, you\u2019d see how desperately sad I am.\u201d\n\nObviously there was the matter of children. When people weren\u2019t commenting on me, a fucking old hag, being so lucky to go out with a smooth-skinned erection machine, they were making assumptions about my reproductive capabilities. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t want kids?\u201d people said to my face, which \u2014 who can blame them, since I said it to my own face a lot.\n\nAlso, their assumptions were right. Right before I met Tor, my gynecologist was like, \u201cHey, it\u2019s a good time in life to see where your hormones are at,\u201d and he ran a test and then showed me a whole bunch of numbers. One of those numbers was really low. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked the doctor. \u201cOh, that basically shows how fertile you are,\u201d he said breezily. My number was like one. \u201cWhat\u2019s normal?\u201d I asked. Normal seemed to be somewhere around 40. I had never wanted children. Intellectually, I knew that children drive men and women apart as much as they keep them together. But knowing this actual number, knowing I was officially unable to have children, I felt a panicked need to be able to provide them.\n\nI fantasized that the next time someone said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t he want kids?,\u201d I would say, \u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d Then I would pause and add, \u201cYour partner seems to not want to be with someone interesting or intelligent, and no one asks them about that.\u201d\n\nBut sarcasm and quick wit has never spared anyone from constant anxiety about having their heart broken. Actually saying these things would not have made me happy. Every day I thought, You need to talk about this, but we almost never did. It just seemed like a surefire way to blow up the relationship, to say to him, \u201cYou know I\u2019m old, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking 45,\u201d my best friend said about all of this, blowing out smoke in annoyance. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t know you can\u2019t get pregnant, well, he\u2019s so stupid that if you ever break up because he suddenly wants a baby, you\u2019ll be glad to get rid of him.\u201d I laughed, but I knew I would never be glad to get rid of him.\n\nI am embarrassed to tell you the number of times I would close my eyes and wish, \u201cWhen I open my eyes, Tor and I will be the same age.\u201d I mean, I did it at least five times a day. Tor didn\u2019t seem super into kids, but every time he played with one and enjoyed it, I would think, Okay, this is it. He is going to come to me and say \u201cI love you, but,\u201d and then I will have to spend the rest of my life living in this tiny town watching his life grow while mine retracts. Just like Demi Moore, except without that new young guy she got after Ashton \u2014 the Australian pearl heir, who had a real pearl embedded in his penis.\n\nWorse than wishing that Tor was 50 was wishing that I was 35. I wanted to be 35 so badly that the mere thought of it would make me sob. Once, when I was 36, I cried in a dressing room because I noticed how fast my muscle tone was going. At the time, I thought I was so old, so ugly, so almost dead already. Now, 35-year-old women seemed like children to me. Tor had several women friends this age, all with young kids. I wanted to be friends with them, but they all terrified me. I felt they were all looking at me weird. When greeting us, grazing their children\u2019s heads with their soft lips and saying, \u201cSay hi to Tor and Sarah,\u201d I felt they were all thinking, How can our wonderful friend in the prime of his life throw it all away for this crazy bitch whose Instagram is just her talking to an old dog? Of course, this was all entirely projection.\n\nFor all the annoyance I felt at being called a \u201ccradle robber,\u201d my own views on the subject were as harsh and judgmental as anyone\u2019s. I was a lifelong feminist who had always kept up with the reading, but it all seemed pretty useless to me in this situation. There were probably other representations of femininity around me at the time, but the only ones I ever saw were young moms, and I thought, I can\u2019t be either of those things.\n\nA couple of years ago, just as we were about to move in together, Tor said he wasn\u2019t sure it was what we wanted. Here it is, I thought, the end I feared, and even worse than I imagined. But it didn\u2019t end, because there are 140,000 therapists in Nevada City, California, and we couldn\u2019t break up until we tried all of them. Imagine my astonishment when I discovered that I had wasted five years thinking that we would break up over our age difference when in fact we were about to break up over something else entirely, which was that Tor felt like in some weird way we weren\u2019t actually all that close.\n\nIn the end, some lady who didn\u2019t actually seem all that impressive on first meeting had us do this weird thing where we held hands and told each other nice things. The other therapists had just whipped us up into frenzied fighting, and we would break up in the car on the way home and agree to get back together, if only for dinner, and then, okay, fine, until the next session. But this holding hands\u2013calm discussion thing did the trick. It\u2019s called attachment therapy, and I\u2019m not going to say that it works and I am definitely not going to get into an argument about it, but it worked for us and we only went like eight times.\n\nI just have one more thing to say: You don\u2019t have to love yourself before someone else can. That\u2019s bullshit. But you do probably have to be able to admit what you really feel at your core, because otherwise, the person you\u2019re with won\u2019t really feel free to do the same. I had thought that telling Tor how I really felt \u2014 not just about my aging body, but my aging mind, the extent to which I felt defeated and sad about life, the disappointment I had that felt permanent \u2014 he would go in search of sunnier skies. But he didn\u2019t. I guess this was actually just all so interesting he just wanted to hear more.\n\nNow he is 40 and I am almost 50. We have been together for almost seven years, and we are happy, and anxieties I had about our being years apart seem like a distant and, given the times, quaint dream. It used to be when I woke up in the morning, I would think, Poor me, I have met this perfect person, but he is just too young, how much time do we have? Now I think, How much time do we have, all of us?! I used to think that there was nothing more emotionally painful than longing to be younger. Now that I long for young people to be able to grow old, I realize I\u2019m only beginning to understand what longing really is.\n\nStay in touch.
