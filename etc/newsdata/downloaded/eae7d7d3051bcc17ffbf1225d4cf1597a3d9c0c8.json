He's the author of Crazy Rich, a biography of the Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder and Band-Aid Dynasty.\n\nAn Idaho woman has won a $40.3million lawsuit against pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson after becoming gravely ill with cancer from using the company's iconic Johnson's Baby Powder.\n\nNancy Cabibi, 71, was diagnosed in 2017 with mesothelioma, a malignant tumor and a fatal form of cancer, after her body tissue showed the presence of two forms of asbestos that, according to court papers, were known contaminants of baby powder.\n\nHer lawsuit is one of more than 14,000 alleging the baby powder caused mesothelioma and ovarian cancer - and has resulted in the company paying more than $50million in damages, according to reports.\n\nFirst introduced by the fledgling Johnson & Johnson company in 1882, the product was said to have been a mix of talc with some plasters powder.\n\nOver time, some 200 ingredients from around the world were combined to give an estimated 60 per cent of all babies born in America a distinctive aroma.\n\nBaby powder would be linked in research to the love of a mother, and the bond between her and her baby.\n\nBut little did anyone know that the symbol that helped sell the product that made the Johnson family enormously wealthy \u2013 a cute baby girl on the virginal white container \u2013 had a life as troubled as the product she was innocently promoting.\n\nJohnson's Baby Powder became a household staple after it was first introduced by the fledgling company in 1882. The product is now at the center of thousands of lawsuits from consumers who claim it has cancer-causing ingredients\n\nJohnson heiress Mary Lea Johnson Richards (pictured right in 1986) was the first baby to be featured on the baby powder label. She would later grow up to sue her father to get more money out of the Johnson family trust\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant has paid out more than $50million in damages in lawsuits over cancer claims\n\nThat baby's name was Mary Lea Johnson, the first infant to appear on the baby powder package.\n\nMary Lea was born in 1926 to blue-eyed, titian-haired society girl Ruth Dill Johnson, the first of the three wives of J. Seward Johnson, a playboy and one of the early barons of the then family-owned company.\n\nJohn Seward Johnson, the father of Mary Lea, was one of the early barons of the then family-owned company\n\nTheir union would be tumultuous as so many marriages throughout the Johnson dynasty generations -- riddled with divorces, tragedies, and scandals.\n\nIn 2017, one of the Johnson family heirs, Robert Wood 'Woody' Johnson IV, who owned the New York Jets with brother Chris, was chosen by President Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.\n\nHis daughter, Casey Johnson led a scandalous 'poor little rich girl' Hollywood life before tragically dying in 2010 at age 30.\n\nBut decades before Casey made headlines, Mary Lea Johnson would become one of the most troubled, vitriolic, and scandalous of Seward and Ruth's brood.\n\nThe year she was born, her father gave her mother her wedding gift: a spectacular mansion in Highland Park, New Jersey, called Merriewold that Seward had built at the enormous pre-Depression cost of $350,000.\n\nIt was a home littered with secret passages, and with the zodiac signs of Seward, Ruth and Mary Lea \u2013 Leo, Libra, and Cancer - over the breakfast room fireplace.\n\nHowever, nothing was merry about life in Merriwold, as I documented in my 2013 biography, Crazy Rich: Power, Scandal, and Tragedy Inside the Johnson & Johnson Dynasty.\n\nMary Lea, the beautiful baby face on the Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder container, would make a startling and very public accusation about her father: That over a period of years when she was a child and a teenager growing up in the house, he had sexually molested her, igniting a horrific family feud.\n\nThere would be those who would claim that Mary Lea had an agenda to sully her father after his death.\n\nWhat greater revenge than accusing him after he died of molesting her.\n\nThe two had gotten into a heated dispute after she sued him in the 1960s in an effort to get more money out of the Johnson family trust.\n\nHe angrily responded, declaring: 'You are turning out to be a troublemaker beyond my imagination.'\n\nJohnson's Baby Powder would be linked in research to the love of a mother, and the bond between her and her baby\n\nOver time, some 200 ingredients from around the world were combined to give an estimated 60 per cent of all babies born in America a distinctive aroma. Pictured above are early ads for the product\n\nI had interviewed Mary Lea's sons from her first turbulent marriage and they disbelieved her story, suggesting that their mother was 'delusional,' or that her third husband, the flamboyant, publicity-hungry gay movie producer Marty Richards, had 'sold her' on making up the story.\n\nMary Lea's brother, Seward Johnson, Jr., a noted sculptor, questioned her claim, but he also stated that he 'felt very badly' for her.\n\nMary Lea got a supporter in the unlikely figure of Judy Garland's daughter, Liza Minnelli, who was upset about her account of her father's alleged incest, and Liza began soliciting funds for a group battling child abuse.\n\nDuring her life, the once healthy, pink-cheeked baby on the baby powder package, had abused alcohol and drugs, as did other members of the famous, infamous and wealthy family.\n\nDuring the New York City summer of 1977, when the '44-Caliber Killer' known as 'Son of Sam' was on the loose and the city was hit by a power failure that blacked out all of five boroughs, Mary Lea was in the banner tabloid headlines once again.\n\nThis time the 50-year-old Johnson & Johnson heiress had claimed to the Bronx District Attorney Mario Merola, 'My husband's plotting to kill me.'\n\nMary Lea had accused her second husband, Vincent D'Arc, a prominent Upper East Side child psychiatrist, of hiring a hit man to kill her so he could cash in on the $20million that she had bequeathed to him in one of her many wills.\n\nD'Arc was treating her troubled teenage son, Seward Ryan, from her first marriage,\n\nFollowing his death in 1983, Seward Johnson's six children, John Seward II, Elaine, Jennifer, Mary Lea, James, and Diana were engaged in a bitter battle over his estate against his widow\n\nToday: Johnson family heir Robert Wood 'Woody' Johnson IV (left) was Trump's pick to be the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He owned the New York Jets with brother Chris (right) - who took over operations after he became a diplomat\n\nWoody Johnson's daughter was socialite Casey Johnson led a scandalous 'poor little rich girl' Hollywood life before tragically dying in 2010 at age 30\n\nThe alleged hit man, according to Mary Lea, was her own chauffeur and a handyman \u2013 a struggling actor who was said to have been Robert De Niro's double in Godfather Part II.\n\nIf he carried out the hit, he was to get paid $200,000. Mary Lea further claimed that her husband had gone to the chauffeur because the two 'were lovers.'\n\nDespite the accusations, her husband was never charged. He told a reporter at the time, 'My wife is very na\u00efve. She has so much money she's like a Howard Hughes, and those around her will tell her anything she wants to hear. All they want is her money.'\n\nHe would also claim that his life was also being threatened, and once received 'a voodoo doll stuck with pins.' He would assert that Mary Lea's story was attributed to 'a menopausal problem.'\n\nIncluded in Mary Lea's various allegations was that D'Arc had 'repeatedly requested' that the baby powder heiress 'engage in sexual intercourse with various men' of his choosing, and in his presence, and that her husband also pursued 'an open, notorious, continuous course of deviant homosexual intercourse' with her handyman, a tall ex-Marine with a pompadour hairdo.\n\nMary Lea grew up in spectacular mansion in Highland Park, New Jersey, called Merriewold that Seward had built at the enormous pre-Depression cost of $350,000\n\nMary Lea was married to Hollywood movie producer Marty Richards, who was openly gay, until her death. Johnson family members and her own sons believed he was there for her money\n\nOne of Mary Lea's sons told me that the case 'ushered in the start of an era in my mother's life where she traveled with bodyguards. My mother was never a picture of mental stability and she took on the role of a hunted victim.'\n\nIn 1978, Mary Lea married the gay movie and theatrical entrepreneur Marty Richards who, one of her sons told me, 'went from a smalltime casting agent to being a big-time producer overnight with her financial backing.'\n\nHe also owned a 14-room, 9,000 sq ft duplex apartment in Manhattan with a private bathroom that had a tile ceiling with his initials in gold leaf like a monogram, 'probably six feet high,' so he could lie in the tub (that could hold four people at a time) and look up at his monogram.\n\nThe apartment was lavishly decorated and compared by visitors to Versailles.\n\nRichards once told a magazine writer, 'I never walked around in a tutu. The only difference was I liked guys.'\n\nBut the fact that he was gay never fazed Mary Lea. She felt he really cared for her, while others, including Johnson family members and her own sons believed he was there for her money.\n\nStill, Richards claimed that he and Mary Lea 'had a totally normal sexual relationship' and that she made him feel 'handsome and virile.'\n\nLike Nancy Cabibi, who recently won the $40.3million award in her lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, Mary Lea was diagnosed with her own liver cancer in 1990, and required immediate liver transplant surgery.\n\nTwo weeks after the surgery and just days before she would turn 64-years-old, Mary Lea Johnson Richards died.\n\nHer death ignited fierce battles over her Johnson & Johnson money involving tens upon tens of millions of dollars, all of it inherited from the riches of the sales of such products as baby powder and Band-Aids.", "description": "New York Times bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer details the scandals, divorces and tragedies throughout the Johnson generations dating back to the 1900s in his book, Crazy Rich.", "authors": ["Jerry Oppenheimer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19543850-0-image-a-25_1570717884036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
