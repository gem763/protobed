Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) threatened to drop out of next Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, claiming that the whole electoral process is rigged against her.\n\nGabbard, whose poll numbers have lingered around 1 percentage point since she entered the race in January, accused the Democratic National Committee and \u201ccorporate media\u201d of \u201ctrying to hijack the election process\u201d in a video she tweeted on Thursday.\n\nGabbard\u2019s announcement cribbed much of the language Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used in 2016 when he lobbed similar accusations against the Democratic Party and the media, and Gabbard even mentioned the senator by name.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders,\u201d she said, before rattling off a list of vague grievances, which she claimed have her considering dropping out of next week\u2019s debate.\n\nThe fourth-term U.S. representative accused unnamed people of using \u201cpolling and other arbitrary methods\u201d to disempower voters in early voting states.\n\nBut Gabbard didn\u2019t specify what, exactly, the DNC or media has done to corrupt the election process. And her following statement \u2015 that the debates were meant to \u201centertain, rather than inform or enlighten\u201d \u2015 comes as she struggled to convince audiences that she could do either of the three.\n\nGabbard failed to meet the polling threshold to qualify for September\u2019s Democratic debate, and many of her policies \u2015 particularly in the realm of international diplomacy \u2015 have come under fire from her fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls and members of the party.\n\nGabbard has previously expressed seemingly tolerant views of Bashar al-Assad, the authoritarian Syrian president. And reports detailing support she has received from pro-Russia voices online have discomforted many in the party wary of the Kremlin after Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections.", "description": "The fourth-term representative from Hawaii released a video vaguely accusing the media and the Democratic Party of conspiring against her.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f69d6210000b908acc55b.jpeg?cache=fsqvqoay5g&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
