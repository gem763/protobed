Now They're United In The Fight For Justice.", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK \u2015 On a mild fall evening, two strangers bound together by unimaginable tragedy at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve met for the first time in Manhattan.\n\nAshley Carr and Alissa Charles-Findley never wanted the spotlight. But their families were thrust into it when Texas police officers, in separate incidents roughly a year apart, opened fire on their siblings in their own homes.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, each woman, like so many other members of Black families who have been victimized by systemic police brutality, would join the frontlines of a national movement they had once supported from a distance.\n\nHours after their first meeting, Carr and Charles-Findley stood beside each other in Foley Square as keynote speakers at a National Day of Outrage protest against police violence, led by Until Freedom, a social justice organization. It was Carr\u2019s first rally, but the words flowed easily.\n\n\u201cThis is something that could happen to anybody,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cWhen does this stop? When are we able to just live, to be productive citizens like we were told to be?\u201d\n\nHayley Miller/HuffPost Tamika Mallory, center, speaks during a National Day of Outrage protest in Foley Square.\n\nFor Carr, the loss of her little sister Atatiana Jefferson was still so raw. It was just 15 days earlier that she was fatally shot through a bedroom window in her home by Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean, who was responding to a wellness check request on her home from a neighbor.\n\nJefferson had been playing video games at home with her 8-year-old nephew, Zion, when she heard something outside and went to investigate, her family says. Zion watched as his 28-year-old aunt moved toward the window and peered outside before being shot and collapsing to the floor.\n\nTen days earlier, former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of murdering Charles-Findley\u2019s little brother Botham Jean in his own home. He was eating ice cream and watching TV on his couch when Guyger, off-duty but wearing her uniform, came through his door and shot him. She thought she was in her own apartment, which was one floor below, and believed the 26-year-old was an intruder. Both Dean and Guyger are white.\n\nWhen does this stop? When are we able to just live? Ashley Carr, sister of Atatiana Jefferson\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since her brother was killed, but Charles-Findley says she\u2019s still processing what happened and sometimes calls his house to see if he\u2019ll pick up. When she saw the news about Jefferson\u2019s death, she felt like she was \u201cdreaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so similar to what happened to my brother,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201dI was the one who received the call from the hospital so I imagined what [Jefferson\u2019s family members] were going through. I felt it. It really hurt to see that.\u201d\n\nShe said she felt compelled to meet Carr on Monday to offer her support and let her know that she\u2019s not alone.\n\nFamily Handout Botham Jean, left, and Atatiana Jefferson, right, were both killed by police in their own homes.\n\nThough some view the Jean and Jefferson cases as anomalies, the attorney representing the victims\u2019 families, Lee Merritt, recognizes them as part of a horrifying, long-standing pattern of police brutality against Black people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always held out that Botham\u2019s case was not really unique,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s different than the dozens of other wrongful death cases where the suspect is unarmed or non-violent and the police officer perceives a threat where there is none and uses deadly force.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who has represented dozens of victims and their families in high-profile police brutality cases, described both Jean and Jefferson as extraordinary people.\n\nHayley Miller/HuffPost People hold signs in New York City's Foley Square during the protest.\n\nJean was a successful accountant and a dedicated member of his church\u2019s choir. Jefferson was a first-generation high school graduate who went on to earn a biology degree at Xavier University in Louisiana. She recently moved into her mother\u2019s house to help support her financially and physically.\n\n\u201cYou could write a book about her that was just about her life and it would still be a page turner ... beyond how she was killed,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThe same is true for Botham.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking to the crowd in Foley Square on Monday, Carr remembered her sister\u2019s selflessness and drive and questioned how Black people can feel safe when they are gunned down by police in their own homes.\n\n\u201cWe did not come from money,\u201d she said. \u201cWe struggled to get where we are. ... So to prevail and still push through and get a degree in biology \u2014 it was just like, \u2018Oh my God, you can do this. You do not have to be a statistic of your environment.\u2019 But for you to still get killed, it\u2019s like what else can you do?\u201d\n\nHayley Miller/HuffPost Ashley Carr speaks about her sister during the protest.\n\nThe majority of police brutality cases end without charges or convictions against the officers, though in recent years, several \u2015 including Guyger \u2015 have been held accountable by juries. Still, some members of Jean\u2019s family believe the 10-year prison sentence Guyger received is too light.\n\nFort Worth\u2019s police chief said he intended to fire Dean, the officer who killed Jefferson, days after the shooting, but Dean resigned first. Police are investigating the incident, but haven\u2019t yet charged him with a crime.\n\nCarr said she believes her sister\u2019s case is \u201copen and shut\u201d and should lead to a murder conviction for Dean. She\u2019s happy to have Charles-Findley and Jean\u2019s family in her life as the litigation involving her sister\u2019s death begins to unfold.\n\n\u201cLife is not a crystal stair,\u201d she said, quoting the poet Langston Hughes when asked how her family is holding up. \u201cEven though we\u2019re facing adversity and facing craziness and facing something that we\u2019ve never thought we would face, we\u2019re going to keep climbing, we\u2019re going to keep marching, we\u2019re going to keep making sure that my sister has justice.\u201d", "description": "The families of Botham Jean and Atatiana Jefferson were drawn together by tragedies that have become all too familiar in the United States.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db85e79210000aa3634b5e9.jpeg?cache=0iprnkfmrn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
