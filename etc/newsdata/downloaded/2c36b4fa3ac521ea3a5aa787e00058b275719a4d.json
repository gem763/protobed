She apparently lied on the applications because she believed it would improve her son\u2019s chances of admittance.\n\nProsecutors sought a four-month prison term for Klapper while her attorneys sought one year of supervised release, CNN reported.\n\n\u201cMs. Klapper thereby not only corrupted the standardized testing system, but also specifically victimized the real minority applicants already fighting for admission to elite schools,\u201d U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said. \u201cWe respectfully disagree that a three-week sentence is a sufficient sanction for this misconduct.\u201d\n\nFifty-one people have been charged in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal, including actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. They\u2019re accused of paying more than $25 million collectively to Singer to promote their children as fake athletes with scholarships or to cheat on the SAT. So far, more than 23 people, including parents, coaches and Singer have pleaded guilty to felonies.\n\nHuffman reported to a prison in California on Tuesday to serve her 14-day sentence.", "description": "Oct. 16 (UPI) \u2014 A California woman received a three-week prison sentence Wednesday for paying a $15,000 bribe to get her son into college, the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
