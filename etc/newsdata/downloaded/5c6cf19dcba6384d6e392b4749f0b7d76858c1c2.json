[partner-box]\u201cWe will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, very importantly,\u201d Trump said on May 9. It\u2019s natural Trump would want to make this claim. Polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that such protections, which prohibit individual insurance plans from charging people more based on their medical history, are a top priority for Americans and among the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) With that context, we decided to put a microscope to the president\u2019s claim. We asked White House staff to point us to the policies or proposals on which Trump\u2019s statement was based. They declined to provide specifics but reiterated the president\u2019s assertion. [khn_slabs slabs=\"790331\" view=\"inline\"] [khn_slabs slabs=\"790331\" view=\"inline\"] Texas V. Azar, And A Health Policy Vacuum Interviews with four separate experts, though, suggested that the administration\u2019s stance on a pending lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act runs counter to Trump\u2019s claim. The case, known as Texas v. Azar, comes from a group of Republican attorneys general who argue that the entire health law should be struck because the 2017 tax bill gutted Obamacare\u2019s requirement to have insurance, often called the individual mandate. In December, a Texas judge agreed. The case is now before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. And, most relevant here, the Department of Justice \u2014 that is, the Trump administration\u2019s legal arm \u2014 has refused to defend the ACA in these proceedings. It\u2019s highly unusual for an administration to decline to defend a federal law in court. \u201cThis is a case when the department can make strong arguments in defense of the statute. Refusing to defend in those circumstances is almost unprecedented,\u201d said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan. [khn_slabs slabs=\"950560\"] [khn_slabs slabs=\"950560\"] Initially, the Trump administration\u2019s position on the lawsuit focused on the individual mandate, arguing that without it the ACA\u2019s preexisting condition protections should be struck down, too. In filing a brief to the appellate court, though, the DOJ joined the plaintiffs to argue the law should be scrapped entirely. This outcome would also eliminate the law\u2019s protections for people with preexisting health conditions. In that context, \u201cthere is real cause for skepticism\u201d about Trump\u2019s assertion, said Wendy Netter Epstein, a law professor at DePaul University. The most generous assessment came from Jonathan Adler, a health law expert at Case Western Reserve University. Adler has supported previous Obamacare challenges, but he argued that this one is legally unsound. He agreed that the White House\u2019s actual actions are \u201cat odds with the president\u2019s promise.\u201d But, Adler said, the structure of Trump\u2019s claim \u2014 promising what his administration \u201cwill\u201d do, rather than commenting on what it has done \u2014 leaves open the possibility of taking other steps to keep preexisting condition protections in place. That\u2019s true, other experts acknowledged. So far, the White House has postponed a legislative push until after the 2020 election \u2014 leaving a vacuum if the courts do wipe out the health law. And, the GOP bills the White House has supported to date \u2014 including the so-called Graham-Cassidy legislation first proposed in 2017, which the administration again endorsed in its 2019 budget proposal \u2014 would fall short, multiple experts said. Unlike the ACA, Graham-Cassidy allows states to redefine which core benefits \u2014 a list that includes protections for people with health problems \u2014 insurance plans must cover, which would make those specific protections optional. (For more on Graham-Cassidy, here\u2019s another PolitiFact check from last fall.) Plus, experts said, even if the White House had a plan, the odds of it gaining passage are slim with a divided Congress. That makes safeguarding the ACA in court \u201cthe only show in town\u201d if the administration is serious about protecting consumers who have preexisting conditions, Bagley said. There\u2019s one loophole that conservatives \u2014 the White House included \u2014 might lean on, suggested Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute. It relies on what people mean when they talk about \u201cprotections.\u201d Some experts also point out that the administration has issued regulations that run contrary to Trump\u2019s claim. In particular, it recently issued a rule loosening restrictions on the length of so-called short-term health plans, which supporters said would bring a more affordable option to the individual insurance market. But these plans, which, because of the rule change, can last a year instead of three months, are considered bare-bones and are not required to provide preexisting condition protections. Our Ruling Trump said his administration will \u201calways protect patients with preexisting conditions.\u201d But the White House\u2019s policy trajectory does exactly the opposite. The DOJ\u2019s stance, which reflects a policy in place at the same moment the president made this claim, would eliminate the only law guaranteeing that people with preexisting conditions both receive health coverage and do not have to pay more for it. And on the regulatory front, the administration has advanced a health insurance option that is not required to include these protections. Furthermore, the administration has not put forth any plan that might keep those guarantees in place. Every replacement health bill it has endorsed has offered protections less generous than those offered by the ACA. And it has taken further steps that could make it harder for people with preexisting conditions to get affordable coverage.
