That's what we're looking to do.\"\n\nHe said successes in the 12 trial areas could be quickly rolled out to other branches.\n\nMr Rowse continued: \"We believe in the future that branches will be a lot more about education - about helping people with those things that are the most important in their life - whether it's: 'I'm opening my first account' or: 'I'm going off to university'... or: 'I'm starting a business'...\n\n\"We're really working with the local community to find out what it is that they want.\"\n\nBarclays said \"pop-up\" banking facilities to help communities will also appear at 300 locations by the end of 2021.\n\nBank branch and ATM closures generally have sparked fears about people's ability to continue to access cash.\n\nThe Post Office, which has around 11,500 branches, offers banking services on behalf of many banks, but some commentators in the access-to-cash debate have argued that this should not be seen as a direct replacement for banks' own branches.\n\nSome other banks and building societies have also recently announced initiatives to boost access to cash or keep branches open.\n\nIn March, Nationwide Building Society pledged that every town and city with a branch will still have one in May 2021.\n\nIn February, Lloyds Banking Group, in partnership with Visa, announced a pilot scheme to boost the number of retailers offering cashback.\n\nHere are the 12 pilot areas where Barclays is looking at how customer demand in branches could be increased:\n\nYarm, Pickering and Guiseley in Yorkshire, Barnard Castle in County Durham, Wombourne and Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, Risca and Tredegar in South Wales, Shenfield and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Esher in Surrey and Biggin Hill in London.\n\nBranches that will be 'saved'\n\nLast in town branches:\n\nAlderley Edge\n\nBargoed\n\nBarnard Castle\n\nBarnoldswick\n\nBiggin Hill\n\nBilbrook\n\nBuilth Wells\n\nBurnham-on-Crouch\n\nCadishead\n\nCarnforth\n\nChalfont St Peter\n\nCockermouth\n\nCuffley\n\nDrayton, Norwich\n\nDunmow\n\nEsher\n\nFlitwick\n\nGuiseley\n\nHaxby\n\nHemsworth\n\nHeywood\n\nHiston\n\nHolmes Chapel\n\nHoyland, Nether\n\nKidsgrove\n\nKnowle\n\nLlandeilo\n\nPickering\n\nRadlett\n\nRisca\n\nSaltburn-by-the-Sea\n\nShenfield\n\nSouth Woodham Ferrers\n\nSouthwick\n\nSt Ives\n\nTredegar\n\nTreorchy\n\nWadebridge\n\nWatton\n\nWest Mersea\n\nWhickham\n\nWoburn Sands\n\nWombourne\n\nWroxham\n\nYarm\n\nYstrad Mynach\n\nManningtree\n\nLlangollen\n\nBentham\n\nKeswick\n\nHarleston\n\nSouthwold\n\nBedale\n\nLeyburn\n\nFramlingham\n\nOundle\n\nKirkby Stephen\n\nSeahouses\n\nLeiston\n\nHaltwhistle\n\nStanhope\n\nMiddleton-in-Teesdale\n\n\n\nRemote branches\n\nBideford\n\nBrecon\n\nBrigg\n\nCaernarfon\n\nCamborne\n\nChipping Norton\n\nCranleigh\n\nDaventry\n\nDeal\n\nDevizes\n\nDriffield\n\nEasingwold\n\nFalmouth\n\nGainsborough\n\nHeathfield\n\nHelmsley\n\nHelston\n\nHorncastle\n\nKirkby Lonsdale\n\nLampeter\n\nLaunceston\n\nLeek\n\nMalton\n\nMarket Drayton\n\nMildenhall\n\nMonmouth\n\nPocklington\n\nPorthmadog\n\nPrudhoe\n\nPwllheli\n\nRichmond, North Yorkshire\n\nSettle\n\nShaftesbury\n\nSheerness\n\nSleaford\n\nStow-on-the-Wold\n\nTenby\n\nThirsk\n\nTowcester\n\nUlverston\n\nWelshpool\n\nWhitby\n\nWorkington", "description": "Barclays Bank reveals it will not shut remote branches or the 'last bank in town' - with 100 to be saved", "authors": ["Vicky Shaw", "Image", "Plymouthherald.Co.Uk", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11592210.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Barclays-profits.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
