In terms of permission, I don\u2019t expect people to ask to be in Liverpool on their day off,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. He hasn\u2019t broken the club code about being out.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t committed a crime, but I think he has been naive to be out before a Champions League game.\n\n\u201cHe has admitted that. I like Ross, I have had no problems with him and he has admitted he made a mistake. I will take that at face value and move on.\u201d\n\nLampard also spoke on the international futures of youngsters Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori, both of whom may be eligible for England.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is for their families and themselves to decide.\u201d\n\nTurning his attention to Wednesday evening\u2019s game against Lille, Lampard highlighted the importance of a win, particularly following defeat to Valencia in the opening group game.\n\n\u201cWe have to be honest, I didn\u2019t think Valencia was the worst game for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have got a result. With Lille they have a lot of threats, speed and quality. It is not the be-all and end-all, we have to see it in the big picture, but it\u2019s a game we have to be ready for.\u201d\n\nThe Chelsea boss provided an update on the fitness of N\u2019Golo Kante, too.\n\n\u201cHe has trained and got through it okay,\u201d Lampard added. \u201cIt\u2019s one that we have to assess. We are positive.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t relate to the Europa League. The fallout of that meant he has had a broken pre-season. He has had a few niggles, some bad luck. Everyone is working to getting him fit.\u201d", "description": "Frank Lampard has defended Ross Barkley after the Chelsea midfielder was involved in a late night row with a taxi driver.
