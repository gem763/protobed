However, while the 36-year-old enjoyed personal success with both clubs, Neymar has endured contrasting experiences.\n\nDuring his time in Spain, Neymar firmly established himself as one of the world's top players, forming a symbiotic relationship with both Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.\n\nThe strike trio, known as \"MSN,\" managed an astonishing 364 goals and 173 assists collectively between 2014 and 2017, helping Barcelona win nine major trophies, including a historic treble in their first season together.\n\nSince moving to Paris in 2017, however, even though he's still lifted trophies and formed another elite attacking triad alongside Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani, things haven't been quite the same.\n\nThe Brazilian's time in the French capital has been marred by a number of incidents on and off the field, which have included lashing out at a fan in the French Cup final defeat the Rennes, insulting officials in the Champions League, and even being accused of rape by a woman who was eventually charged with fraud, extortion, and slander by Brazilian police.\n\nRead more: The woman who accused Neymar of raping her has been charged with fraud, extortion and slander by Brazilian police\n\nSaid incidents have resulted in a high profile fallout with the powers that be at PSG, including sporting director Leonardo, who told Le Parisian that Neymar was free to leave the club during the summer if there was \"an offer that suits everyone.\"\n\nBarcelona came calling, doing \"everything possible\" to try and re-sign its former star, according to club CEO Oscar Grau, but it wasn't to be.\n\nHowever, Alves believes it won't be long before his ex-teammate finds himself back at Camp Nou, where he is truly happy.\n\n\"Regarding Neymar, I still think his happiness is in Barcelona,\" Alves told Business Insider.\n\n\"I believe he'd find happiness in continuing the success he had there a couple of years ago. When you are happy somewhere you try to go back to the place you were happy, and I think that's what he tried to do.\n\n\"I'm sure if in the future he wishes to go back he will be able to.\"\n\nAlves believes Neymar will return to Barcelona in the future. Getty/Shaun Botterill\n\nAlves left PSG in June as a free agent following two successful seasons in France before choosing to return to his home country, Brazil, in August and sign for his boyhood club, Sao Paulo FC.\n\nThe veteran defender was given a heroes welcome upon signing, with an estimated 40,000 fans turning up to see the 36-year-old presented as a Sao Paulo player, according to AS.\n\nAnd he quickly cemented his icon status at the Estadio do Morumbi when he the scored the only goal of the game on his debut in a 1-0 win over Ceara SC.\n\nThings haven't gone so smoothly since \u2014 Alexi \"Cuca\" Stival's side has won just two of its last six games \u2014 but Alves, who recently partnered with The Players' Tribune to create a new video series documenting his return to Brazil, insists he's thrilled to be home and living out his childhood dream.\n\nRead more: The 12 highest-paid soccer players in the world\n\n\"It's a unique sensation. It feels like I'm wanted by the people, and I'm reminded of my childhood dream which has turned out so much greater than what I imagined,\" he told Business Insider. \"I will enjoy this opportunity to write another chapter in my life.\n\n\"I believe that in life, you have to conquer your dreams. The dreams are bigger than all possibilities, bigger than how much you will get \u2013 it's the opportunity to bring the dream alive. I can say now that I realized all my dreams to play for Barcelona and now S\u00e3o Paulo. Now I'm here to try to write another winning chapter in my career.\"\n\nAlves is the most decorated soccer play of all time, according to The Guardian, having won 43 major honours throughout his career in spells with Bahia, Sevilla, Barcelona, Juventus, PSG, and his country.", "description": "Dani Alves told Business Insider he believes Neymar can be happy again if he returns to Barcelona after a difficult spell at Paris Saint Germain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b57622e22af283e3e4899?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
