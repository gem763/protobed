Here are Playbook\u2019s lasting impressions from a wild week:\n\n\u2014 Banks and nongovernmental organizations have leapt ahead of most governments on climate, with detailed action plans, and deep-pocketed investments\n\n\u2014 Official speeches have been sidelined: they are no longer the main form of diplomacy at UNGA: Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, made that point clear on Thursday, when he paused at the beginning of his speech to take a selfie. \"Many more people will see this selfie than listen to this speech,\" he explained.\n\n\u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 even the low-energy version \u2014 will always suck up the political oxygen, no matter the location or topic.\n\n\u2014 Colombia\u2019s President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez is the individual leader who stood out most. He was everywhere and impressive, rallying support for a modernizing Colombia struggling with the fallout of the Venezeulan governance crisis. Listen to his interview with Playbook here.\n\n\u2014 Anti-climax of the week: France and Germany\u2019s \u201cAlliance for Multilateralism.\u201d While more than 40 foreign ministers were involved in what the French foreign minister described as \u201can informal coalition\u201d for \u201chumanitarian action,\u201d there is no sense of momentum around the group. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that multilateralism must become \u201cmore inclusive, more representative, and more effective,\u201d but assembled a group that was 80 percent European, the main exceptions being the foreign ministers of India, South Africa, Australia and Morocco.\n\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING, and welcome to the final edition of POLITICO\u2019s U.N. Playbook. Today, Sudan, finance and issues facing small island nations are rounding out the GA agenda.\n\nOver lunch, the U.N., African Union and Sudanese government are conducting a high-level meeting on Sudan\u2019s transition away from military leadership (the military removed President Omar al-Bashir from office on April 11, while military and civilian leaders formed a three-year transitional government August 17). The African Union has been the main international broker in that process after China and Russia blocked U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres from getting more involved.\n\nMeanwhile, the question of how the cash-strapped U.N. can mobilize the money to meet its 2030 global development goals is the focus of a day-long \u201chigh-level dialogue.\u201d\n\nThe final summit this week focuses on the needs of Small Island Development States (the ones at risk of being submerged by rising oceans), running through Saturday.\n\nA message from S&P Global: Providing essential data requires that we go beyond the balance sheet.

It wouldn\u2019t take much to persuade outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that his native Luxembourg is a light among the nations. But other world leaders might also be persuaded after Prime Minister Xavier Bettel\u2019s soaring and sweeping address to the General Assembly on Thursday \u2014 a speech that proved a leader\u2019s ambitions are hardly constrained by a small population. Watch in full here.\n\nBettel spoke for more than 20 minutes, beginning by wishing good luck to his friend and neighbor, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, who will take over on Dec. 1 as president of the European Council. (More on Michel in a minute.)\n\nGrand Duchy\u2019s giving pledge: Bettel outlined Luxembourg\u2019s aspirations to use its wealth (it has the highest per capita GDP in the EU) to make the world a better place, and then shifted into a defense of multilateral cooperation \u2014 a theme many leaders viewed as more urgent after Trump\u2019s speech emphasizing sovereignty and nationalism.\n\n\u201cThe major challenges facing humanity cannot be overcome unless we act universally and as one, unless we find a global response,\u201d Bettel said. On trade, Bettel warned of disputes \u201coften based on mendacious pretexts\u201d \u2014 unnecessary fights in which he said \u201cthe international community and our people risk coming out the losers.\u201d\n\nGlobalism as common sense: He defended the EU as \u201cquintessential\u201d for peace and argued globalism just makes sense: \u201cWe have always been in favor of an active dynamic and rules-based multilateralism as Luxembourg, that is perhaps natural for a very small country that has an open economy, but it\u2019s also a rational choice.\u201d\n\nHumans and human rights first: Bettel was perhaps at his most passionate speaking about human rights, particularly women\u2019s rights and tolerance for LGBTI individuals: \u201cAs I think we are all aware, or we ought to be aware: homosexuality is not a choice, let it be accepted that that is how people are,\u201d said Bettel, who is Luxembourg's first openly gay prime minister. \u201cWhat is a choice is homophobia and we should not tolerate it.\u201d\n\nRemembering the Nazi past: \u201cWhen you see a return of Nazi ideas, and a denial of what happened, I really asked myself, did we really learn the lessons of the Second World War.\u201d\n\nOn reproductive rights: \u201cIt is not up to the state to tell women is best for them, still less is it up to men to tell women what is best for them.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM BENELUX: The European Council\u2019s current and future presidents also had their turn in the well of the cavernous General Assembly.\n\nViews from Belgium: Charles Michel, the Council president-elect was rather understated, speaking in the capacity of his current post as prime minister of Belgium. He focused on the big themes of climate change, sustainable development and peace and security. And in his introductory remarks, he quoted, poignantly, from former French President Jacques Chirac whose passing had just been announced.\n\n\"In a changing world, there is no greater risk than staying still,\" Michel said, quoting Chirac. He added, \u201cHistory always shows it is progress that is at the heart of cooperation, European or international.\u201d\n\nDONALD TAKES DOWN DONALD: Tusk, the outgoing Council president who was formally representing the EU at UNGA, used his final speech to launch a no-holds-barred broadside against Trump. It was an eloquent and forceful beatdown, in which among other things he urged the blustery American president (without ever naming him) to \u201cjust stop lying.\u201d A fuller report on Tusk\u2019s speech is here.\n\nANTONIO GUTERRES REPORT CARD: Guterres arrived in office with many blessings and one big curse. He is the first real politician to lead the U.N, having had experience running his own country of Portugal, the EU and parts of the U.N. itself. That matters because he\u2019s not just a diplomat: His job is to work with 193 national leaders, nearly all of them holding a political office (a few mostly hands-off royals are sprinkled in), with relatively little executive power or money at his disposal.\n\nGuterres\u2019 bind is that he arrived in New York at a time of rising nationalism, spearheaded by a potent figurehead: Donald Trump. In that context, speaking too loudly and too often might simply highlight the U.N.'s impotence on a given issue. Yet if Guterres stays silent, he will look irrelevant or out of touch with most of his member countries.\n\nHis first task then is making sure the U.N. still exists as an organization in two years, or seven (if he seeks and gets a second term, which he hasn\u2019t yet committed to). He told the General Assembly Tuesday that his broader task is to stop the world from splitting in two, around American and Chinese poles, each with \u201ctheir own zero sum geopolitical and military strategies.\u201d\n\nSo how is he doing operating in this narrow space? His team insists he\u2019s laboring hard to reform the U.N. as a mere first among many equals. Playbook partially buys the argument, but Guterres must have some power, on the basis that virtually no one we spoke to wanted to go on the record with an opinion, in order to protect their relationship with him.\n\nThe good:\n\n\u2014 Has opened up U.N. events and processes, letting private actors step in where U.N. member states fail to.\n\n\u2014 He does well on retail politics, traveling and reaching out to ordinary people, and building those experiences into his communications.\n\n\u2014 Avoided the trap of engaging in direct combat with hardliners \u2014 including his own members \u2014 who criticize the U.N.\n\n\u2014 Neil Walsh, the head of the U.N. cybercrime center, told Playbook \u201che\u2019s human and gives a damn. Can\u2019t ask for much more really.\u201d\n\nThe bad\n\n\u2014 The Security Council is virtually dysfunctional these days, with unpredictable leaders gumming up the system.\n\n\u2014 Criticized for doing too little publicly on urgent human rights situations, including in Venezuela and regarding China\u2019s Uighur population. Guterres firmly rejects that criticism: \u201cIt is absolutely not true that I\u2019ve only done discreet diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe controversial\n\n\u2014 Guterres has stepped up his rhetoric on climate, directly calling for an end to new coal projects and for a global carbon pricing system.\n\n\u2014 Guterres has successfully integrated key appointees pushed by the Trump administration, including Henrietta Fore as head of UNICEF. These figures act as useful buffers in Washington anytime the administration hints at defunding the U.N. \u201cHe feels emboldened now,\u201d compared to the first year of the Trump administration, according to one senior U.N. official.\n\nTrump Latest: Domination Corridor Talk, Again\n\nNothing to see here! Sitting at a distance in New York, the most striking news development Thursday was not the whistleblower complaint itself, but the apparent effort to lock down the July 25 call memo in highly secure systems. The handling of the record in that way will lead to some very uncomfortable questions for the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s last UNGA words: Whoever the whistleblower talked to is \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and \u201cin the old days,\u201d spies were dealt with differently. \u201cThe remark stunned people in the audience, according to a person briefed on what took place, who had notes of what the president said. Trump made the statement several minutes into his remarks before the group of about 50 mission employees and their families at the event intended to honor the mission,\u201d Maggie Haberman of the New York Times reported. Audio of Trump\u2019s remarks here.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s last word? Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a phone call with the Atlantic: \u201cIt is impossible that the whistleblower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons \u2014 when this is over, I will be the hero,\u201d Elaina Plott reports.\n\nDid we mention the mind-bending nature of Ukraine politics? Hunter Biden \u201cdid not violate\u201d Ukraine laws, says former top prosecutor. \u201cHunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,\u201d Yuriy Lutsenko told the Washington Post.\n\nBORIS AND BREXIT BRIEF: The EU is starting to expect a showdown at what could be Boris Johnson\u2019s final EU leaders\u2019 summit next month. But EU leaders and negotiators are making clear there will be no negotiations, nor an endless late-night discussion on a legal text at the summit on October 17.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Charlie Cooper analyzes where the British prime minister went wrong. Jack Blanchard interviews Keir Starmer, the opposition U.K. Labour Party\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, in this week\u2019s EU Confidential podcast.\n\nTHE ROYAL WE: European Royals have been out in force this UNGA week, doing a lot more than cutting ribbons. Figures such as King Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands, Queen Mathilde of Belgium and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway have been some of the most articulate and forceful advocates for multilateralism and the most vulnerable people. Prince Harry wasn\u2019t in New York, but gave a speech in Botswana backing climate activist Greta Thunberg and quoting Guterres\u2019 UNGA speech.\n\nMathilde and Haakon are Sustainable Development Goals advocates, and Willem-Alexander used his UNGA speech (which he rather than the prime minister delivers) to say \u201cwe should cherish the multilateral system and its international agreements and rules as a precious achievement.\u201d But it\u2019s M\u00e1xima who has the most elaborate U.N. links, having served for 10 years as the U.N. secretary-general\u2019s special advocate for inclusive finance for development.\n\nNEW CYBER PEACE INSTITUTE: Marietje Schaake of the Netherlands (a WEF Young Global Leader and former member of European Parliament) is its president.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY \u2014 GLOBAL CHILDHOOD CANCER INITIATIVE: St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and the World Health Organization have pulled together 123 institutions with the aim of saving the lives of 1 million children with cancer by 2030. Getting there will require curing 60 percent of children with the world\u2019s six most common types of cancers. Given that St. Jude\u2019s estimates half the world\u2019s children living with cancer go undiagnosed today, it\u2019s a huge lift. Yet it\u2019s possible: Today in the United States, the survival rate is 80 percent. Worldwide, though, the figure is 20 percent, which is where the U.S. and Europe were in the early 1960s. More details here from Dr. Carlos Rodriguez-Galindo.\n\nCatching Our Eye\n\nDid you know? Out of 120 speeches by world leaders to the U.N. General Assembly only six were delivered by women. PassBlue analyzes the situation.\n\nPlastic can still be fantastic: In the main installation area at the U.N., UNICEF C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Conceptos Plasticos have reconstructed walls of a classroom made up of bricks made from 100 percent recycled plastic waste. A single classroom uses 5 tons of waste, and helps expand access to education in a country with a classroom shortage.\n\nQuotable\n\n\u201cPlastic is a design failure.\u201d \u2014 Maldives\u2019 President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who wants his country to be plastic-free by 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty shy about calling people. I just want to mail them my charts.\u201d \u2014 Microsoft founder Bill Gates. h/t Robbie Gramer\n\nDataPoints of the Day\n\nWORLD POPULATION CLIMBING BEYOND EXPECTATIONS: The United Nations forecast for the 2050 human population is adjusted every couple of years \u2014 and estimates rise with nearly every adjustment. Although further declines in birth rates are expected, life expectancies will continue to rise.\n\nPatterson Clark/POLITICO\n\nView the full DataPoint graphic here.

Where does data fit into the challenge of saving lives and helping people achieve a sense of security about their health? Playbook spoke to Rockefeller Foundation chief Raj Shah for POLITICO\u2019s U.N. podcast, and we asked more than a dozen folks at U.N. HQ \u2014 from elevator operators to presidents \u2014 about what is being done to limit preventable deaths in their countries. Special thanks to Jenny Ament who produced this special podcast series from New York City.\n\nPlaybook also spoke to Guillermo Miranda, the global head of corporate citizenship at IBM, about how data can be used for social good. (Declaration: Ryan Heath\u2019s partner works for IBM).\n\nFinancing a Sustainable Future\n\nWe\u2019ve already heard about Queen M\u00e1xima\u2019s hands-on work to advance financial inclusion. She\u2019s started a trend it seems: Ivanka Trump\u2019s WGDP program parrots M\u00e1xima\u2019s language (watch her interview here). Other finance initiatives catching our eye:\n\nNew report from the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative: \u201cDigital with Purpose: Delivering a SMARTer2030\u201d, identifies and quantifies how digital technologies can help governments, businesses and philanthropic organizations meet the U.N. Global Goals quicker. It includes 500 case studies where tech is helping to get the world onto a sustainable path.\n\nFinance Against Slavery and Trafficking: This is a project based at the United Nations University Centre for Policy Research, where leading banks and survivor service providers work to offer financial services to survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking. Banks involved include Bank of America, Bank of the West, Barclays, BB&T, BMO Financial Group, Citi, Erste Bank, HSBC, LCNB National Bank, Scotiabank, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.\n\nThe project organizers said in a statement that \u201csurvivors often find that traffickers have hijacked their financial identity or banking products for money laundering or other criminal purposes, spoiling their creditworthiness and increasing their risk of re-victimization.\u201d Dr. James Cockayne, who heads the secretariat supporting this work, said \u201cmodern slavery leaves us all worse off because it treats people as disposable objects rather than full economic and social agents.\u201d\n\nEntourage\n\nBRUSH WITH FAME: What would you do if you emerged from your bathroom stall at the United Nations to find your president brushing his teeth in front of you? If you\u2019re Playbook\u2019s French source, the answer is you fail to recognize him at first. If you then figured out who it was as you dried your hands, would you A) gasp B) apologize and wish him good morning or C) scurry away? The source scurried away.\n\nYUNUS SIGHTED! UNGA regulars have been known to take bets or play a special version of Bingo!, around how many times the microcredit legend Muhammad Yunus will pop up at events, on screens, and in print, in and around UNGA week. He\u2019s been notably quiet this week, until popping up in a press release about modern slavery to inform us that: \u201cMicrocredit has offered a big breakthrough in reaching the most vulnerable segments of the global population.\u201d\n\nMEGASTAR \u2018GLOBAL GOAL LIVE\u2019 EVENT: Playbook knew it would be star-studded when the organizers asked media to arrive 90 minutes before the event started (Playbook wisely arrived a mere 15 minutes in advance) at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse under the Brooklyn Bridge. The room was filled with actual famous people, and the sort of people who are so young and beautiful, they kind of look famous: influencers, maybe.\n\nThe event was an elaborate way of Teneo \u2014 the CEO advisory firm and co-organizer \u2014 saying that woke celebrity is the highest form of celebrity currency in 2019. We were all there to learn, in a collective rapture thanks to nudges by former CNN presenter Isha Sesay, about Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream.\n\nThe event\u2019s supporters want to see the world\u2019s poorest 59 countries raise \u2014 either through tax-generating foreign investment or loans and donations \u2014 an additional $350 billion a year to put toward achieving the U.N.\u2019s Global Goals. The demand is in line with the Gates Foundation\u2019s call to focus on the most extreme poverty.\n\nBut what does a figure like that really mean? To give you three points of context: It\u2019s $200 a year for every person in the world, 3 percent of the wealth of the world\u2019s estimated 2,150 billionaires, and one-sixth the world\u2019s annual defense spending.\n\nMark Burnett will produce simultaneous 10-hour concerts on five continents, including in New York and Lagos, this time next year. The list of artists and supporting organizations is really too long to include here, but everyone\u2019s favorite man at the event was Hugh Evans, CEO of Global Citizen, by all accounts the new Bono when it comes to mobilizing voices and cash to fight extreme poverty.\n\nA message from S&P Global: \u201cNow, environmental groups are pushing policymakers for tools like securitization to help ease utilities' concerns about the cost of shuttering coal generators early. The initiative is raising thorny questions about who should foot the bill and creating awkward alliances between environmentalists and utilities accused of blocking efforts to fight climate change\u2026\u201d Read more essential intelligence on climate risk from S&P Global.\n\nU.N.
