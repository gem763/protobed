According to a report in Tablet magazine, she also spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories at the first organizers\u2019 meeting of the Women\u2019s March, claiming that Jews were leaders in the African slave trade. One of the group\u2019s original leaders, Carmen Perez, is staying on despite the fact that she too has been accused of blaming Jews for the slave trade.\n\nSarsour, also a supporter of Farrakhan, is active in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which advocates an economic boycott of Israel. She was recently hired by Bernie Sanders to work on his presidential campaign.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The Women's March announced the introduction of 16 new members to its board on Monday, one of whom once accused the FBI of recruiting for ISIS.Zahra Billoo, a civil-rights attorney who is also the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations's San Francisco chapter, made the accusation", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CGKeqr92MGbTvXLt7j_qBA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/3aef723aaba26dd99b1b7435feaf3b97", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
