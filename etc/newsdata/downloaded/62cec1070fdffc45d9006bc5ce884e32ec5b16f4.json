Deep emissions cuts by 2030\n\nTimmermans wants to raise the bloc\u2019s emissions cutting target to at least 55 percent by 2030 from the current 40 percent, and wants scientific ammunition to persuade reluctant governments.\n\nThe Commission is planning to assess the impacts of raising the target, and Timmermans said: \u201cI personally would be extremely surprised if the outcome of this would lead to any other conclusions than at least 55 percent by 2030 \u2026 but let\u2019s do the research on that.\u201d\n\nA multi-country alliance already supports 55 percent, but many Central and Eastern European countries worry that doing so carries enormous costs. Timmermans acknowledged that moving to 55 percent means \u201casking for some really tough extra measures to be taken.\u201d\n\nBut MEPs want more. Jytte Guteland, coordinator for the Socialists and Democrats group, asked Timmermans to be the Commission\u2019s own version of Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Greens said they want him to go for a 65 percent target.\n\n2. Financing for the Just Transition Fund is unclear\n\nGoing climate neutral will cost a lot of money \u2014 and MEPs wanted to know where it will come from.\n\nCommission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has promised to create a Just Transition Fund to help regions and workers \u2014 especially in the coal sector \u2014 adapt to greener energy, but hasn\u2019t said how the fund will be financed. Timmermans wasn't much clearer.\n\n\u201cOf course, there will be new money \u2026 it can't all be rechanneling of existing funds,\u201d he said. It will be a \u201cmix of fresh money, combined with co-financing,\u201d links with existing programs such as agriculture, cohesion and structural funds, and with the European Investment Bank.\n\nBut that can only really be determined once the Commission sets out its proposal for the fund \u2014 something it is promising in its first 100 days \u2014 and once EU leaders agree on the next long-term EU budget.\n\nTimmermans made clear he sees \u201cno future in coal,\u201d but the murky finances around the transition fund left an opening for his political opponents. \u201c\u2018Coal has no future\u2019 says Frans #Timmermans, but how does he want to help countries like Poland with the clean energy transition? Just Transition Fund is clearly not enough,\u201d the EPP tweeted.\n\n3. Transport emissions have to fall\n\nTimmermans underlined that transport has to contribute to the European Green Deal. \u201cI don't want a car-free Europe. I want emissions-free cars in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nHe promised to work on extending the Emissions Trading System to the maritime sector (as well as to aviation, although it\u2019s already included) \u2014 and to consider bringing in the car industry, while warning it \u201ccannot be used as an excuse not to attain emissions targets.\u201d He also called for more investment in railways to shift people away from flying.\n\n\"This should not be seen as a threat to the transport sector. It's actually an offer. It's an offer because I want to empower the sector to roll out new clean efficient and affordable vehicles and infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nBut green group Transport & Environment said that \u201cconcrete proposals to clean up transport\u201d would be needed to \u201clive up to the positive rhetoric\u201d of the hearing.\n\n4. Europe can't fight climate change alone\n\nTimmermans wants the European Green Deal to be replicated by other major economies: \u201cWe have to work to convince others to step up their ambition too,\u201d he said. If the bloc\u2019s \u201cclimate diplomacy\u201d doesn\u2019t work, he\u2019s prepared to use the stick, too.\n\n\u201cWe should also be prepared to consider other instruments, for instance a carbon border tax, to level the playing field for European products if other countries do not go as far as us or refuse to go in the right direction,\u201d he said. \"As an economic giant we have tremendous leverage in our trade relations.\"\n\nThe green deal is, above all, an industrial policy, Timmermans said. \u201cI believe European manufacturing has understood this [green] transition is inevitable to safeguard jobs in the future.\"\n\n5. He faces a fight in with other Commission barons\n\nAlthough his job is to bring in the Green Deal, the new structure of the Commission means Timmermans lacks control over the economic tools to implement his promises: Taxation, budget and economic policy are all under the control of other commissioners.\n\nHe said he \u201cwill need the commissioners to work with me, we will need to pull in the same direction \u2026 we all need to coordinate our efforts and that is part of my job.\u201d\n\n6. He\u2019s a people\u2019s man\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing showed Timmermans is a skilled politician, at ease with skirting challenging questions but not afraid of verbal fights.\n\nHe charmed MEPs with his multilingual skills and sprinkled jokes throughout the hearing. He also took on Italy\u2019s Silvia Sardone, from the right-wing League, who challenged the incoming Commission\u2019s climate plans and criticized the hype around Thunberg. \u201cHow weak do your arguments have to be if you have to resort to attacking a 16-year-old girl,\u201d Timmermans replied to applause.\n\nHis final remarks ended with a poetic warning. He delivered a verse from a poem by Edwin James Milliken about a man who falls asleep while driving a train \u2014 a process he likened to the current trajectory of the Earth\u2019s climate. \u201cFor the pace is hot, and the points are near, and sleep hath deadened the driver\u2019s ear; and signals flash through the night in vain. Death is in charge of the clattering train!\u201d he recited.\n\n\u201cWe should never come to that,\u201d he told MEPs.", "description": "The Dutchman is set to get the backing of MEPs.", "authors": ["Paola Tamma", "Anca Gurzu", "Kalina Oroschakoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176799810-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
