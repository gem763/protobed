It tracks all U.S. homicides since then involving of four or more people killed (not including the offender) over a short period of time (24 hours) regardless of weapon, location, victim-offender relationship or motive.\n\nMinger said he scoured multiple reports on the fire numerous times before deciding to proceed with prosecution. Woodford County Coroner Tim Ruestman said the fire was started intentionally.\n\n\u201cIt was a heavy decision,\u201d Minger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s charging a very young person with one of the most serious crimes we have. But I just think it needs to be done at this point, for finality.\u201d\n\nIf convicted, the child could be placed on probation for at least five years but not beyond the age of 21, he said. Therapy and counseling would be likely.\n\n\u201cProbation, given the age, is about the only outcome that could happen here,\u201d Minger said.\n\nNo arrest warrant is to be issued for the suspect, Minger said. The suspect will be appointed an attorney and will be subject to a bench trial, in front of a judge, he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Journal Star, http://pjstar.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A 9-year-old boy accused of causing a mobile home fire that killed three children and two adults in central Illinois has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/illinois_fire_five_dead_40891_c0-251-3000-2000_s1770x1032.jpg?601654ce81a4f21c434bcb337d9c0f0e1a331e0f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
