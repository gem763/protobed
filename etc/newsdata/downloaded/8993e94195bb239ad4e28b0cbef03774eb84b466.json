Myers, a professor at Dongseo University in South Korea who specialises in North Korean propaganda, the images present an imperial motif of a leader protecting the cultural and ideological purity of the nation from corrupt, outside forces.\n\nKim also visited the site of a giant construction project in nearby Samjiyon county, KCNA reported, and blamed US-led international sanctions for his country's hardships.\n\nKim Jong Un also visited the site of a giant construction project in Samjiyon county, KCNA reported\n\n\"The situation of the country is difficult owing to the ceaseless sanctions and pressure by the hostile forces and there are many hardships and trials facing us,\" Kim was quoted as saying.\n\nNorth Korea is under multiple sets of UN sanctions for its nuclear and missile programmes.\n\nPyongyang and Washington restarted working-level talks this month in Sweden only for it to quickly break down, with the North blaming the US for not giving up its \"old attitude\".\n\nNorth Korea tested this month what it said was a submarine-launched ballistic missile that marked a \"new phase\" in its capabilities -- the most provocative in a series of weapons tests it carried out since 2018.", "description": "New pictures of Kim Jong Un riding a white horse through a winter landscape to the summit of Mount Paektu, a sacred peak for North Koreans, have fuelled...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/06/wire-19773140-1571202170-530_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
