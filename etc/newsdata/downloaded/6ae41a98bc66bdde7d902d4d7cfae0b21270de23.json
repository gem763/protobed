Rather, work permits for Salvadorans will be extended for 1 year past resolution of litigation for an orderly wind down period. \u2014 USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli) October 28, 2019\n\nThe announcement came amid several agreements unveiled by the Trump administration in recent weeks to receive buy-in from Central American countries in stemming the flow of migrants heading toward the U.S.\n\nA judge last year halted the administration's move to end TPS for countries including El Salvador, with the government saying it would abide by an injunction extending the program until January 2020 while appealing the ruling in federal court.\n\nCuccinelli pushed back on Monday after U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Ronald Johnson said in a tweet that the deal announced this week \"extends TPS for Salvadorans in the US by one additional year.\"\n\nA USCIS official reiterated to The Hill in an email Tuesday that \"this is not a TPS extension.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s an extension of the wind-down period during which work permits for Salvadoran nationals with TPS will be valid while they prepare to return to their home country,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment, instead referring The Hill to DHS.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to issue a ruling related to the administration's push to end TPS soon.\n\nThe agreement on the work permits is the latest as the administration seeks to curb both legally and illegal immigration, particularly from Central America.\n\nThe U.S. previously reached an asylum agreement with El Salvador last month.", "description": "The Trump administration has reached an agreement with El Salvador to extend work permits for 250,000 Salvadoran immigrants\u00a0under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for an additional year while a broader fight over the program plays", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/elsalvador.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
