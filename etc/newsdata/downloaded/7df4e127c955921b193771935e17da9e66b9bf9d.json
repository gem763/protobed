Kaepernick filed a grievance alleging the NFL and its teams colluded to keep him out of the league; the NFL settled the grievance with a $10 million payment to Kaepernick and former 49ers teammate Eric Reid.\n\nThursday\u2019s release, authored by agent Jeff Nalley and PR rep Jasmine Windham, said Kaepernick has not been offered a job or even a workout by \u201ca single team,\u201d although the Seattle Seahawks planned to work him out in the 2018 offseason.\n\n\u201cSeattle brought Colin in for a visit but did not work him out,\u201d the release said. \u201cAfterwards, (Seahawks coach) Pete Carroll said Colin is \u2018a starter in this league.\u2019 No other NFL team has interviewed or worked out Colin in the past 3 seasons, despite other false statements in the media to the contrary.\u201d\n\nThe release goes on to say that Nalley reached out to all 32 NFL teams \u201cwith little to no response\u201d and that Kaepernick has not demanded a specific salary if he were to sign somewhere. It claims that Kaepernick \u201cfits into most teams\u2019 system\u201d and spends most of the second page breaking down Kaepernick\u2019s 2016 statistics.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is difficult to think of another young player in NFL history with statistics and character as impressive as Colin\u2019s not being given an opportunity to earn a spot on an NFL roster after what he has accomplished,\u201d it concluded.\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s representatives released statements today to clear up some facts surrounding their client: pic.twitter.com/Wo86KTkKDM \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 10, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
