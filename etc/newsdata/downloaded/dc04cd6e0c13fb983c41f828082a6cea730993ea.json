The effort has been underway since March 4, when the committee announced it would look into \u201cthe alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power\u201d on the part of the president . Last Thursday, committee members passed a resolution setting the parameters for the investigation \u201cto determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.\u201d On Tuesday, the panel began what its chairman, Representative Jerry Nadler, has said will be an \u201caggressive series of hearings\u201d to this end.\n\nThis does not mean that the committee will necessarily recommend impeachment. But Mr. Nadler\u2019s team is working to establish whether that step makes sense.\n\nUnfortunately, there is tremendous confusion about what the Judiciary Committee is up to \u2014 largely because of conflicting signals from House Democrats, who have been struggling with their public statements on impeachment. Mr. Nadler has said repeatedly that his committee is engaged in an impeachment investigation \u2014 or, if you prefer, an impeachment inquiry. He insists the \u201cnomenclature\u201d does not matter. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and her leadership team clearly disagree. They assiduously avoid the \u201cI\u201d word, painting the committee\u2019s work as garden-variety oversight.\n\nAs a result, even Democratic lawmakers don\u2019t seem to know whether they are engaged in an impeachment inquiry. Representative Pramila Jayapal has said \u201cyes.\u201d Representative Jim Himes has said \u201cno.\u201d Last week, Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, said \u201cno\u201d \u2014 then backtracked, claimed he\u2019d misheard the question and offered a non-answer instead.", "description": "When the speaker of the House thinks it is politically foolhardy.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/opinion/17impeachment/17impeachment-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
