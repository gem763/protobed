NOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\u201d he also tweeted.\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking into Pence\u2019s stay at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg on the west coast of Ireland, which is 180 miles (300 km) from the capital, Dublin, where his meetings were held.\n\nElijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, wants documents on the visit sent to the panel by Sept. 19. The House Judiciary Committee is also looking into the stay as part of an investigation of Trump\u2019s proposal to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven economic summit at his Florida resort.\n\nCummings is also concerned about Scotland\u2019s Prestwick Airport, looking into purchase orders for fuel totalling $11 million and reports that the airport offered cut-rate rooms for select passengers and crew, as well as free rounds of golf at Turnberry to visiting U.S. military and civilian air crews.\n\nIn a statement, the Air Force said it would review all guidance related to the selection of airports and lodging accommodations during international travel.\n\n\u201cWhile initial reviews indicate that aircrew transiting through Scotland adhered to all guidance and procedures, we understand that U.S. Service members lodging at higher-end accommodations, even if within government rates, might be allowable but not advisable,\u201d the statement added.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence meets with Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson (not pictured) at 10 Downing Street in London, Britain, September 5, 2019.

Trump opened the Trump International Hotel shortly before he was elected in November 2016 and it has become a favoured lodging and event space for some foreign and state officials visiting the U.S. capital. In July, a federal court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Democratic attorneys general over the hotel, saying the case lacked legal standing.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday dismissed Democrats' allegations of impropriety over Vice President Mike Pence's stay at Trump's Irish resort and over the U.S. military's use of a Scottish airport near a Trump-owned golf course.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428082105&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881S9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
