John Rafferty, who is in charge of executing modernization efforts for the service's top priority, long-range precision fires, told Defense News.\n\nThe US agency has set 2023 as its goal to test a prototype and following the event, the team will determine if they should move forward with a program of record.\n\nRafferty did note that the cannon will go through a range of 'big technology gates' and one will be completed 'very soon'.\n\nThe first gate is said to be early ballistic tests and if successful, a report will be sent to Army higher ups for approval.\n\nIf successful, the war machine will give the US Arm an advantage it needs to measure up with major opponents like China (pictured) and Russia who have invested more than $215 billion in military operations combined\n\nHowever, one of the main focuses is developing this technology in a way that is cost efficient.\n\nArmy Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville told Defense News in a recent interview that 'A lot of that comes down to cost.'\n\n'If we are able to develop the strategic, long-range cannon system, the rounds may be only $400,000 or $500,000 compared to multimillion-dollar rounds,' McConville continued.\n\n'Cost does matter, and we are concerned about cost.'\n\n'There are some, definitely, physics challenges in doing these types of things, and that is the trade-off.'\n\nPropaganda video claims China has 2,500 ballistic missiles A propaganda video from China has claimed that Beijing owns about 2,500 ballistic missiles, including one of the world's most powerful weapons, DF-41. DF-41 missile is said to have the longest range of any ballistic missiles in the world, and could reach London or the United States with nuclear warheads. The same video, however, also said that other countries shouldn't be afraid of China's 'advanced artillery force' because Beijing wouldn't deploy the weapons unless it's provoked. China's other missiles include DF-21 which boasts a firing distance of up to 1,926 miles (3,100km) and has been dubbed 'the killer of aircraft carrier'. The missile is potentially capable of sinking a U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carrier in a single strike, media have claimed. The DF-10 missile, on the other hand, is the best performing long-range cruise missile in the world, according to Chinese news site Sina.com. Sina said the 990-pound (450kg) weapon could strike a maximum distance of 1,242 miles (2,000km) and could reach Japan and Taiwan if it's fired from inland China. The DF-15B missile is an improved version of the original DF-15 missile and debuted in 2009 during the military parade to celebrate China's 60th National Day. The missile can reportedly travel at the speed of 1.4 miles (2,000 metres) per second and its striking accuracy is within 98 feet (30 metres).\n\nIf this long-range cannon is successful, it will be the advantage the US Army needs against major opponents like China and Russia who have invested more than $215 billion in military operations combined.\n\nJen Judson with Defense News explained that each of the technology gates is designed to determine if the cannon is meeting 'lethality and cost goals'.\n\n'This idea of volume and affordability and lethality is first and foremost in our minds,' Rafferty said.\n\nMcConville added, 'The Army is 'trying to be innovative, but what they have to do is demonstrate the capability at each phase along the way.'\n\n'And if that doesn't happen, we are not doing it.'", "description": "The US Army is developing a powerful cannon capable of shooting a projectile more than 1,150 miles - the same distance between Nashville, Tennessee and New York City.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/16/19889954-0-image-a-34_1571412923420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
