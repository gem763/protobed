We have alternatives. We have noble and uncorrupt people,\" who can govern.\n\nMain roads remained closed across the country on Saturday.\n\nSecurity forces said they have deployed across the country to open key routes.\n\nThe measure came after Lebanon's top security agencies launched an army-led \"plan\" on Saturday to clear road blocks.\n\nAn army spokesman told AFP that security forces would negotiate with protesters, without resorting to violence.\n\nNortheast of Beirut, dozens of demonstrators formed a human chain to prevent the army from removing a dirt berm blocking a seaside road.\n\nIn central Beirut, they sat cross-legged on a key artery that connects the capital to its suburbs and surrounding regions.\n\nDemonstrators who had slept in tents near Martyrs Square said they were still defiant.\n\n\"We will stay on the streets,\" said Rabih al-Zein, a 34-year-old from the Shiite stronghold of Tyre in southern Lebanon.\n\n\"The power of the people is stronger than the power of the parties.\"\n\nLebanon's largely sectarian political parties have been wrong-footed by the cross-communal nature of the mostly peaceful protests.\n\nWaving Lebanese flags rather than the partisan colours normally paraded at demonstrations, protesters have been demanding the resignation of all of Lebanon's political leaders.\n\nIn attempts to calm the anger, Hariri has pushed through a package of economic reforms, while President Michel Aoun suggested banking secrecy should be lifted from the accounts of high-ranking officials.\n\n- Counter-demonstrations -\n\nIn recent days, loyalists of Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement have mobilised counter-demonstrations across the country, sparking scuffles with demonstrators and journalists.\n\nThe Iran-backed Hezbollah is a member of Lebanon's ruling coalition and represented in government, and it is the only movement not to have disarmed after the country's 15-year civil war.\n\nIt is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States.\n\nHundreds of its supporters gathered in the group's strongholds in Beirut's southern suburbs and the southern cities of Nabatiyeh and Tyre after Nasrallah's speech, brandishing party flags.\n\nIn Nabatiyeh on Saturday, dozens of anti-government demonstrators returned to the streets, with a protester saying he was counting on the army and security forces to protect them from party loyalists.", "description": "Demonstrators across Lebanon blocked roads and took to the streets Saturday for a 10th consecutive day, defying what they said were attempts by Hezbollah to defuse their movement and despite tensions with the army.
