But it just can knock on anybody\u2019s door,\u201d said Mercker, who was the first person to participate in the clinical trial.\n\nShe said doctors performed a series of checks before administering the vaccine during the 12-week trial at the clinic in Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cThey always took your blood, you had a physical, they\u2019d make your shot right there on the spot for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was three shots, all in a row, alternating arms, four shots, two weeks apart.\u201d\n\nChumsri stated the vaccine is designed to mirror other routine shots. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be just off the shelf, kind of similar to when you get the flu shot or pneumonia shot,\u201d the oncologist noted.\n\nHowever, as a part of the trial, Mercker was required to have a mastectomy.\n\n\u201cThat is the only way we know that everything was removed properly,\u201d Chumsri said.\n\nIn April, researchers began working on another cancer vaccine that is said to harness the power of the immune system to destroy cancer cells by injecting the medicine directly into the tumor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re injecting two immune stimulants right into one single tumor,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Brody, director of the Lymphoma Immunotherapy Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cWe inject one tumor and we see all of the other tumors just melt away.\u201d\n\nReports said that eight out of eleven lymphoma patients who participated in a clinical trial of the vaccine experienced partial or complete destruction of the tumor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to teach the immune system to get rid of the thing even after you\u2019ve already got the problem,\u201d Brody said.", "description": "A new cancer vaccine has given researchers hope after it removed cancer cells in a patient with breast cancer.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/vaccine-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
