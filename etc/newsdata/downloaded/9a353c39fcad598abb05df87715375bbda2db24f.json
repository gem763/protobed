Caussin, a recovering sex addict, revealed that he received a topless photo on Oct. 5 from a woman he says he doesn\u2019t know. The former NFL player deleted the text, but Kramer found it on his Apple Watch.\n\nDuring the podcast episode, Kramer still seems unclear as to whether or not she believes Caussin, given his history of cheating on her.\n\nMIKE CAUSSIN CLARIFIED HIS COMMENT THAT JANA KRAMER CHEATING ON HIM WOULD BE A 'DEAL BREAKER'\n\n\u201cI saw it, and \u2026 my heart just fell. I was like, it\u2019s here. It\u2019s happened again. I\u2019m such a f---ing idiot \u2026 Like, how is this happening again?\u201d she said (via Us Weekly). \u201cI don\u2019t want to live this kind of life. We just moved into this beautiful house, and we had our second kid, and we fought so hard. Why is this happening again?\u201d\n\nThe couple separated in 2016 after she found out about his infidelity, but they renewed their vows in 2017. In March, Kramer revealed that Caussin had a relapse in 2018. Although he said at the time that he never had sex outside the marriage after being caught in 2016, the incident colored her opinion of their current situation.\n\n\u201cWhether he ends up meeting with someone or not \u2026 That last relapse, he almost did, and I was going to sign the papers,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, he gets even close to the fire, and I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m like, does he not know that and realize that and love our family enough?\u201d\n\nIn the uncomfortable episode, Kramer explains that she can\u2019t trust her husband because he\u2019s successfully lied to her in the past.\n\nJANA KRAMER DESCRIBES FINDING OUT ABOUT HUSBAND'S CHEATING RIGHT BEFORE GOING ON STAGE\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m kinda caught in this weird, like, what do I believe? Was it just a fluke? I don\u2019t know,\" she said. \"So I\u2019m like, do I keep asking for signs, or are these my signs to f---ing get out of Dodge? Sorry, this is just really fresh.\u201d\n\nCaussin acknowledged his mistake in deleting the text, noting that Kramer finding something like that can be \u201cextremely triggering\u201d given his past behavior.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things that\u2019s just difficult to navigate. It\u2019s beyond hurtful to see Jana hurt and upset and feel things that she feels because of the things I\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\n\nJANA KRAMER, MICHAEL CAUSSIN CALL OLIVIA CULPO A 'SOCIAL CLIMBER' AFTER DANNY AMENDOLA COMMENTS\n\nThe podcast ends with Kramer saying she can\u2019t yet look at her husband. However, she took to Instagram on Monday to give a small update on life after the very raw episode aired.\n\n\u201cToday is a tough one. Our podcast episode that aired this morning was one we almost didn\u2019t let air at all,\u201d Kramer wrote over a selfie of herself in bed. \u201cUp until a day ago mike and I wanted to pull the episode completely and just not have an episode for today because it was that heavy for us.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe thing though is because Mike and I work together the show must go on and I realize we can\u2019t just cancel things because we are in a bad spot. So instead I put my big girl pants on and started to record with mike after a very long and intense 24hours of not talking to each other.\u201d\n\nShe explained that they eventually decided to release the episode in the hopes that their communication on the matter would help other couples going through something similar. She concluded her caption with an update on how they\u2019re doing with the photo drama.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cBecause the podcast didn\u2019t end great...today we are good, and have grown stronger from it.
