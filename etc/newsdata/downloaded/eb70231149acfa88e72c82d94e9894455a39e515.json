Art lovers vexed Tate Britain felt 200-year-old paintings needed \u2018violence & suffering\u2019 warning", "language": "en", "text": "One of the world\u2019s most renowned art museums, Tate Britain, has reportedly found it necessary to warn visitors about its newly opened William Blake exhibition \u2013 because now even 19th-century engravings require trigger warnings.\n\nImages that surfaced on social media appear to show a cautionary message that greets those who are brave enough to survey 300 original prints and paintings by William Blake, described as the largest collection of the British artist\u2019s work in nearly 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe art of William Blake contains strong and sometimes challenging imagery, including some depictions of violence and suffering,\u201d the warning says. The placard advises distressed art lovers to seek out museum staff if they require further coddling.\n\nThe best commercial for an exhibition ever. \ud83d\ude1c pic.twitter.com/CYtkSoCdFH \u2014 Rembrandt's Room \ud83d\udd8c (@RembrandtsRoom) September 12, 2019\n\nThe warning, it seems, did not sit well with those who came to see some priceless art \u2013 and not be treated like children.\n\n\u201cSuffer, snowflakes, MELT!\u201d wrote one miffed Blake fan. \u201cGreat art is free to shock. May such beautiful lines and gorgeous hues ever be the greatest of your worries.\u201d\n\nAn equally peeved netizen expressed amazement that there are actually people who are so fragile that they require content warnings at art museums.\n\nAre we really so surrounded by snowflakes and wilting lilies who take offense at everything that such labels are necessary in art museums for artists like William Blake?\n\nThe Tate\u2019s bizarre hand-holding even caught the attention of art critics. One review of the exhibition noted that the museum \u201cthought it necessary to warn us that one vitrine contains an image of \u2018the brutal treatment of an enslaved person.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt this rate, one might expect similar cautionary messages to accompany paintings of famous battles. After all, who will shield us from the horrors of canvas-based violence?\n\nThe urge to safeguard grown adults from content that might not be suitable for toddlers has a long and proud history.\n\nAlso on rt.com British theatre company now issues \u2018trigger warnings\u2019 to prevent \u2018audience distress\u2019\n\nIn 2017, a major British theatre company, the Royal Court, began issuing \u2018trigger warnings\u2019 at its more risqu\u00e9 performances to avoid upsetting audience members.\n\nThat same year, the University of Glasgow introduced \u2018trigger warnings\u2019 for its theology course over fears students may be traumatized while learning about the crucifixion of Jesus.
