And if I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing,\u201d de Blasio told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m looking at it right now.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDe Blasio has forged ahead with his campaign for the Democratic nomination despite failing to top 1 percent in most polls, and getting shut out of the third round of debates scheduled for next week. Wednesday's comments were the first time he suggested an end date for a campaign that has struggled to capture attention nationally and continues to be a source of criticism back home.\n\nA fourth debate, set for mid-October, will have the same requirements to qualify as the September debate: candidates must reach 2 percent in four-DNC approved polls and receive donations from 130,000 unique donors. Another New York politician, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, exited the primary stage last week after failing to qualify for the upcoming debate.\n\n\u201cOf course it was disappointing not to get into September,\u201d de Blasio said Wednesday. \u201cBut I fully gathered that October was the same standards, but with a month more to achieve them.\u201d\n\nCandidates have until Oct. 1 to qualify for that debate.\n\nDe Blasio said he\u2019s still holding out hope for a viral moment to lift his campaign out of the doldrums.\n\n\u201cPeople go from unheard of to totally famous in 72 hours in America now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a candidate like me, who's not that well known yet \u2014 you know, ask me in 72 hours, right? Something might change.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/49/a8/0bc6edd34fc585a9f2e93ebb2ebf/artboard-1.png\"\n\nIn his quest to amass small donors who would help him qualify for the debates, de Blasio has become ensnared in a feud within Brooklyn\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community, POLITICO reported last week.\n\nEmails and fliers circulated encouraging donations to de Blasio, and claiming the mayor promised to facilitate construction of a hotly-disputed synagogue project in return. But one sect within the feuding Satmar community said that those documents were forged to embarrass the other sect.\n\nDe Blasio said Wednesday he did not make any such promises and had no knowledge of the synagogue project until he read the POLITICO story.\n\n\u201cI was not aware of the issue to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone did forge that, that\u2019s thoroughly disgusting and unacceptable. No, none of that ever came to my attention. And I would never make a decision on anything but the merits anyway.\u201d\n\nThe two sides within the Williamsburg Orthodox community have been sparring over the property for the past decade, and emails produced through a freedom of information request show high-ranking city officials have been made aware of the issue.\n\nSally Goldenberg contributed to this report.", "description": "De Blasio has forged ahead with his campaign for the Democratic nomination despite failing to top 1 percent in most polls.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-BillDeBlasio_13.png"}
