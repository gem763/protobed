You\u2019ve got cinnamon, coriander, cardammon and a little touch of nutmeg as well. That really sums up every kind of spice that is used in this part of the world.\"\n\nNext they headed for Dubai's Jumeirah Fish Market to feast on the catch that's been landed.\n\nGary picked out a fish with a familiar enough name, but one that might be misleading.\n\n\"Sardines I absolutely love. Again, I\u2019ll eat those all day. Just sort of very quickly cooked. It\u2019s a variety. It\u2019s a variety they are calling mackerel but that\u2019s very different to the mackerel we get in the UK.\"\n\nfish at Dubai market\n\nNext it was high time to visit Gary's kitchen at his RhodesW1 restaurant for a fry-up - although at the last minute the Michelin mastro eschewed the \"mackerel\" for a more familiar offering, salmon.\n\n\"So, what I thought I\u2019d make for us is just a nice little salmon,\" he said, wielding the pan.\n\n\"And that, I\u2019m just going to lightly pan fry. But I thought I\u2019d serve that with a nice little risotto on the side.\"\n\n\"Right now the cooking of this fish. There\u2019s a sizzle and ... that is telling me how far that is cooked at the moment.\"\n\nWith the salmon ready, Jane needed to know how her risotto was being dressed up.\n\n\"Most risottos as you know will contain parmesan cheese or something like that. I\u2019m not going to be adding anything like that because I don\u2019t think that parmesan is going to marry very well with a bisque sauce.\"\n\n\"Just baste it with this lovely sort of lemon butter. And now we\u2019re ready to dress.\"\n\n\"And there you have it. Pan fried salmon with a little confit lemon risotto with asparagus and a little salmon bisque sauce.\"", "description": "Taste met up with Michelin star chef Gary Rhodes who now calls the United Arab Emirates home.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/68/50/90/1000x563_cmsv2_10f260b8-26c7-5373-bb3c-7fab517764b9-3685090.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-28"}
