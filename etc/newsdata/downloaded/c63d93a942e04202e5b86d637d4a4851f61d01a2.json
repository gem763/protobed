However, a referendum in November 2016 by the Board of Regents failed to receive enough votes to remove the seal. The board did, however, approve funding for the formation of a committee that would research possible alternatives to the \u201cConquistador\u201d seal.\n\n\u201cThe seal at The University of New Mexico will remain the same \u2013 for now. The UNM Board of Regents\u2019 voted unanimously today to approve two of six recommendations to abolish the university seal, but stopped short of approving a complete change by removing the existing figures, a Spanish conquistador and a frontiersman, and replacing them with something more inclusive, aspirational, honoring diversity and/or defining of an institution of higher learning,\u201d the university wrote in a press release at the time.\n\nThe university noted at the time that students felt that the seal glorified violence against Native Americans. \u201cThe official seal came under intense scrutiny earlier this year after Native American students, including members of the UNM Kiva Club, and The Red Nation, an off-campus Native American advocacy group, said the current seal is offensive in glorifying the violent treatment of natives. UNM has one of the highest populations of Native American students in the U.S.,\u201d the press release continued.\n\nAt the beginning of October, the University of New Mexico announced in a press release that it would accept submissions for a new seal. The press release encourages designers to reflect the university\u2019s relationship to Native American tribes in the new seal.\n\n\u201cFounded in 1889, UNM sits on the tradition homelands of the Sandia Pueblo. The original peoples of New Mexico \u2013 Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache Tribes \u2013 have significant connections to the land,\u201d the press release reads. \u201cBeing the state\u2019s flagship institution and one of only a dozen Hispanic Serving Institutions in the United States, the UNM Seal Committee is seeking an original design that exemplifies the university\u2019s past, present and future.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "The University of New Mexico announced this week that it is replacing the university's \"Conquistador\" official seal in response to a protest effort by a group of student activists that called it \"racist.\"", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/09/wi/ap/08/19e88g4-e1571328430344-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
