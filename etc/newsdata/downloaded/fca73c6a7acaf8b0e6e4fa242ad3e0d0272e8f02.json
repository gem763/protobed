The woman wound up going to the hospital to receive treatment for facial swelling and a busted lip.\n\nHe then wound up threatening another victim within his own neighborhood, allegedly telling a male victim he would stab him if he did not fork over his sneakers.\n\n\u201cGive me your sneakers or I\u2019ll stab you,\u201d Johnson allegedly said.\n\nBut the teen reportedly took his criminal acts to the next level on October 8 when he reportedly sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl who was on her way to pick up her sister at school.\n\nJohnson first allegedly demanded that the 12-year-old fork over her cell phone and cash. When he found nothing, he allegedly forced her to a nearby basement where he ordered her to take off her pants and underwear before sexually assaulting her, according to court documents.\n\nJohnson was arrested for the alleged sex attack and the string of robberies and is being held on $105,000 cash bail or $130,000 bond at the Horizon Juvenile Center in the Bronx.\n\nA city police officer warned that cases like these are just the beginning once state laws allowing nonviolent offenders to walk free and ending automatic criminal prosecution of 16- and 17-year-olds go into effect.\n\n\u201cThis is a very scary situation,\u201d the law enforcement source told the Post. \u201cThis poor girl is the victim of a broken system, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to see many more stories like this. This is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s mother, Cheryl Johnson, 47, said she does not believe the allegations against her son and blamed the New York Police Department (NYPD) for framing him.\n\n\u201cThis is an African American boy being framed!\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. Very respectful. He gets along with everyone. He plays with the kids and stuff.\u201d\n\nShe accused the police of harassing her son and filed \u201cfour or five\u201d complaints with the NYPD\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau. A spokeswoman for the NYPD said the matter was \u201cunder internal review.\u201d\n\nDefense lawyer Jay Schwitzman, who is representing Johnson, maintains that his client is innocent and \u201cwill fight the charges in court.\u201d", "description": "An alleged gang member who was out on $6,000 bail for armed robbery and assault has been accused of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/police-car-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
