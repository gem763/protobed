It was a very emotional moment for him.\"\n\n'How Bryer wanted his body dealt with'\n\nThe bodies of McLeod, 19, and Schmegelsky, who would have turned 19 on Aug. 4, were discovered on Aug. 7 near the Nelson River in northern Manitoba.\n\nRCMP found the pair after an intense 15-day search which began with the seemingly random murders of Australian Lucas Fowler, American Chynna Deese and UBC lecturer Leonard Dyck.\n\nThe bodies of tourists Chynna Deese and Lucas Fowler, left, were found near Liard Hot Springs, B.C., on July 15. University lecturer Leonard Dyck, right, was found dead four days later near Dease Lake, B.C. (New South Wales Police; University of British Columbia)\n\nFowler and Deese were shot on July 14 or 15 at the side of the Alaska Highway near Liard Hot Springs in northern B.C. Dyck's body was found four days later in a highway pullout near Dease Lake, about 500 kilometres to the southwest.\n\nThe truck Schmegelsky and McLeod were said to have been driving to Whitehorse was found on fire nearby. Police named the pair as suspects in the days after they were reported missing.\n\nThe hunt zoned in on northern Manitoba after a RAV4 was found burning near the community of Gillam, eight kilometres from the spot where the two young men would ultimately meet their deaths.\n\nThe existence of a final video has been reported, but RCMP have yet to discuss its contents.\n\nIn an earlier letter to Leamon, police said the video \"has to do with how Bryer wanted his body dealt with after death, and that information was passed on to his mother, the next of kin.\"\n\n'An emotional time for everybody'\n\nLeamon said RCMP retained control of the video file at all times and did not give Al Schmegelsky a copy to keep for himself.\n\n\"It was in a private room where he was able to watch it himself,\" the lawyer said.\n\nShe was also present.\n\n\"It was an emotional time for everybody who was involved, and I'm sure it's going to be an emotional time moving forward.\"\n\nA still taken from surveillance footage released by the RCMP shows Kam McLeod, left, and Bryer Schmegelsky leaving a store in Meadow Lake, Sask., on July 21. (RCMP)\n\nLeamon said she doesn't know if McLeod's family have also seen any portion of the video but she said that the battle to get access to the video \u2014 like every other part of the case \u2014 presented a set of unusual questions.\n\n\"Some of those questions have to do with the Wills and Estates Act and what constitutes a will in the province of British Columbia, and whether or not a holographic [video] will could be considered to be a valid will,\" she said.\n\nMany of those questions are unsettled, but Leamon said by arriving at an agreement with RCMP, Al Schmegelsky was able to avoid litigation.\n\nLeamon said that RCMP wanted a non-disclosure agreement because they are continuing to investigate the case. She said police may release portions of the video to the public at a future date, at which point Al Schmegelsky would be able to talk about the contents.\n\nShe said she expects that a public inquiry into the case will occur in the future and that her client would participate.", "description": "The father of one of two young B.C. men who became fugitives after allegedly killing three strangers in July has now seen part of a video his son recorded minutes before apparently taking his own life.", "authors": ["Jason Proctor Is A Reporter In British Columbia For Cbc News", "Has Covered The B.C.
