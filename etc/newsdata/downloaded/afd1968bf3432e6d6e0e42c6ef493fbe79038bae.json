The company said it was a response to regulations implemented by the TLC in 2018.\n\n\"And as always, we encourage you to reach out to your local elected officials to let them know how you feel about these TLC regulations and explain how they've impacted you,\" Uber said in an online Q&A for drivers posted last Thursday.\n\nThis story is developing.
