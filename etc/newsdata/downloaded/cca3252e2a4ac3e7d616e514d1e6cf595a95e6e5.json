Ryan won a Nintendo Switch Lite. Be sure to follow us on Instagram and Facebook for news about our next awesome competition.\n\nIn Untitled Goose Game, you are in control of a goose whose sole aim is to make innocent people miserable by doing all sorts of horrible things to them.\n\nYou can, for example, make a boy slip by untying his shoelaces, and then steal the toy aeroplane he had in his hand. You can then take the plane to the toy store and place it on the shelf, and wait for him to arrive. Finally, cackle with glee as he is forced to hand over his hard-earned cash to repurchase his very own toy.\n\nVideo of Untitled Goose Game - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch\n\nIf this sounds ridiculous, that\u2019s because it is; and that\u2019s part of the reason the game is so fun. Though the gameplay is incredibly simple (you can only honk to attract attention, run, and interact with objects via a simple button press), it\u2019s very satisfying to figure out the correct method to pull off the perfect prank. Players will need to use a bit of trial and error to crack each level, but the game\u2019s delightful humour will keep you invested.\n\nThe game is also complemented by a charming art style. Instead of opting for super flashy, uber-realistic graphics, the developers went with a flat, hand-drawn animation style with bright and colourful objects. This suits the whimsical nature of the game very well, and the visual cues (such as thought bubbles that show you what your human victims are thinking about) add polish to an otherwise very straightforward game environment.\n\nOctopath Traveller game review: Nintendo Switch exclusive is a beautiful homage to classic 16-bit JRPGs\n\nThe sound is also top-notch. When nothing is happening, the background music is very calming. But when a victim of your mischief is chasing you, the music becomes way more upbeat and will set your heart pounding as you try to escape.\n\nEven though this game has many positives, there are still some flaws. For example, during some missions, you can get locked outside of an area, which means you are unable to complete game objectives. These bugs should have been ironed out before being released to the public.\n\nIn conclusion, Untitled Goose Game is the hilarious avian simulation game that no one actually asked for, but everyone is glad exists. Fans of well-balanced puzzle games with a slightly-twisted sense of humour should pick up this indie title on the Nintendo Switch today.\n\nEdited by Jamie Lam", "description": "Being annoying is the best gameplay mechanic in the latest stealth game from Australian indie developer House House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/43c75304-efcc-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires142555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
