FATF requires member countries to take steps to prevent entities from being used for criminal purposes, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, and to ensure the beneficial information can be obtained or accessed quickly by the authorities.\n\nFATF said its members have found it challenging to implement and meet the existing standards. Some common challenges include inadequate ways that ensure authorities could access the information in a timely matter and a lack of effective and proportionate fines on companies that fail to provide accurate information on beneficial ownership.\n\nFATF recommended countries implement one or more mechanisms to meet its standards. That could include using existing sources of information, such as those derived from financial institutions and from registries of property; and requiring company registries to keep up-to-date information on beneficial ownership; as well as obliging companies themselves to obtain information on shareholders or members, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe variety and availability of sources increases transparency and access to information, and helps mitigate accuracy problems with particular sources,\u201d FATF said in the report, which also provides some cases and examples of best practices.\n\nThe paper comes as U.S. lawmakers look to address shell-company ownership transparency. Some limited-liability companies, often referred to as shell companies, are registered in the U.S. under the names of representatives who neither own nor operate those companies.\n\nThis week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that requires shell companies to disclose their true owners in an effort to crack down on money laundering and other crimes. It is unclear if the bill will pass the Senate, where a similar bill is being discussed.\n\nThe House bill requires most limited-liability companies and corporations report to the U.S. government the names of anyone with a significant financial stake or control over operations.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body that sets standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, said countries that rely on a single approach are less effective in obtaining accurate and timely information about the ownership of an entity.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120975/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
