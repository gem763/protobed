The magnitude of the wrongdoing described by Taylor, and the care and sincerity of his efforts to document that wrongdoing, can\u2019t be drowned out by yelling about the manner in which Schiff chose to interview him.\n\nSuch errors have tripped up the president over the course of the Ukraine scandal: He chose to zero in on the whistle-blower\u2019s identity in an effort to impeach the credibility of the complaint, only to see a steady parade of civil servants, and his own ambassador to the European Union, corroborate the majority of the whistle-blower\u2019s account under oath. Trump refuses to let go of his demand, of course, but the point is mostly moot; just as raising questions about the origins of the Russia probe will not change what Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report says, outing the whistle-blower won\u2019t unring the Ukraine bell. And yet Trump makes the same mistake again, moving on to attacking Taylor over his supposed political leanings\u2014which is, of course, not responsive to what Taylor actually alleged.\n\nThat these tantrums purport to be about process is as irrelevant as the substance of what any 2-year-old shrieks about while lying on the floor kicking and pounding fists. As Taylor\u2019s own testimony shows, process does matter. It matters very much. But complaints about process, especially meritless ones, cannot obviate the ultimate task before the president\u2014that of mounting a substantive defense of his own efforts to withhold military aid and other assistance to Ukraine in exchange for damaging information on his political rivals. It is precisely because the president and his supporters seem to know, at some level, that the task before them is an impossible one that they are reverting to tantrums instead of taking it on.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
