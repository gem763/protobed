You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme reports two senior Tories familiar with Boris Johnson\u2019s thinking who are \u201cconvinced\u201d the new prime minister is eyeing a return to the old plan.\n\nFurthermore, the EU \u2013 and notably Ireland \u2013 has signalled that such a change back to the old backstop might be a good solution.\n\nIn an interview with the Irish Times, Ireland\u2019s EU commissioner Phil Hogan \u2013 who is set to be put in charge of trade talks with the UK \u2013 said the direction of travel was towards the old backstop.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied when asked whether it was back on the agenda. \u201cThe taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage \u2013 albeit at the eleventh hour \u2013 that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK.\u201d\n\nBritish officials in Brussels flatly deny that there is any intention to return to the original backstop. A UK spokesperson said that \u201cany deal must involve the abolition of the anti-democratic backstop\u201d.\n\nBut recent moves by the UK do suggest that even if the original EU plan for a Northern Ireland-only backstop is not copied wholesale, the principle underpinning it \u2013 that the backstop does not apply to Ireland \u2013 could return.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

One thing to come out of those discussions is that the UK is now apparently willing to accept regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and Ireland on agricultural products \u2013 technically known as SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary).\n\nWhether such alignment would necessarily be part of the plan to replace the backstop for other areas \u2013 like manufactured goods \u2013 is less certain, however. Talks have not yet reached that stage. Any movement in the discussions will be followed closely in the UK, where the situation is politically explosive.\n\nOne UK official was keen to stress that plans for agricultural alignment were different to the original backstop because the UK had worked out plans to strengthen Northern Ireland\u2019s say in the arrangement.\n\n\u201cAgrifood is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland and we are ready to recognise that reality,\u201d they told The Independent.\n\n\u201cSo we are having exploratory discussions on how an all-island approach to SPS might work. It is worth remembering that agriculture and food is the largest single sector of cross-border trade.\u201d\n\nThe official added: \u201cWe are committed to the GFA [Good Friday Agreement] and to ensuring that communities have a say over how they are governed and the rules that they implement. So we are looking at how we can strengthen this commitment in the agreement.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
