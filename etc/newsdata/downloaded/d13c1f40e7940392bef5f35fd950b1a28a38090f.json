From Halloween to New Year\u2019s Eve, it can be incredibly hard to resist indulging in holiday treats. However, it\u2019s important to remember that we are what we eat, and some foods are better for our overall health \u2014 including our complexion \u2014 than others.\n\nDespite what you might have heard, the relationship between flawless, glowing skin and diet isn\u2019t crystal clear. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a huge link between diet and the skin,\u201d Nazanin Saedi, MD, tells us. She points out that there are very few evidence-based studies supporting the claims that certain foods cause acne. That being said, there is some evidence linking specific foods, like certain dairy products and high-glycemic foods to skin flare-ups. Whereas nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats have been linked to skin benefits.\n\nSo which foods should you stay away from during the holidays, and where should you indulge? We asked the experts and they gave us some advice.\n\nAvoid: Potato chips with sour cream and onion dip\n\nSalty potato chips paired with creamy onion dip are often on the table at holiday gatherings, but when it comes to your skin health, the savory holiday treat isn\u2019t going to do you any favors. Jackie Newgent, RDN \u2014 culinary nutritionist, author of the upcoming The Clean & Simple Diabetes Cookbook, and nutrition advisor for Lunch Unpacked \u2014 points out that most chips and dip are generally considered pro-inflammatory, which can negatively impact skin appearance.\n\nTry instead: A big handful of whole grain corn tortilla chips with guacamole\n\n\u201cNumerous studies find a beneficial association between avocado intake and skin health,\u201d Newgent tells us. Plus, both corn and avocados contain lutein and zeaxanthin. Research has found that these carotenoids may help protect your skin from damage caused by UV radiation.\n\nMORE: We recreated PF Changs banana spring rolls recipe with a healthier twist\n\nAvoid: Eggnog\n\nWhether you love or hate this rich, holiday drink, someone is going to hand you a glass at some point during the festive season. Newgent explains that the cream in eggnog contains saturated fats that are inflammation-inducing, which is no bueno for skin or your health in general. Additionally, if eggnog is spiked with rum or another spirit, drinking too much of it can contribute to dehydration, leading to dry-looking skin.\n\nTry instead: A cup of hot chocolate made with dark chocolate and plant-based milk\n\n\u201cRegularly choosing chocolate that\u2019s rich in cocoa flavanols may potentially protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun no matter what season it is,\u201d Newgent explains.\n\nAvoid: Holiday sugar cookies\n\nSugar cookies are a staple holiday treat at every winter shindig. While they may be super tasty, Newgent points out that the combination of \u201cbad\u201d fats, processed white flour and added white sugar is a triple whammy of inflammation triggers \u2014 which is the opposite of what you\u2019ll want for clear skin.\n\nTry instead: A sliver of pumpkin pie\n\nDelicious pumpkin pie actually has some health benefits. \u201cPumpkin is rich in beta-carotene, which acts as an antioxidant that\u2019s helpful for youthful-looking skin,\u201d says Newgent. Research points to beta-carotene\u2019s role in skin photoprotection. Additionally, the eggs used in pumpkin pie filling contain skin health nutrients, including biotin, which may be linked to healthy skin, hair and nails.\n\nAvoid: Party punch\n\nStay away from the holiday punch bowl, warns Newgent. \u201cDrinking classic party punch is basically like drinking sugar,\u201d she maintains. Due to the high glycemic index of sugar, it causes a release of insulin in the body, triggering inflammation that seems to be linked to acne.\n\nTry instead: A cupful of fresh-squeezed pink grapefruit juice\n\nIf you want to drink something sweet, Newgent urges you to try and get plenty of nutrients along with it. \u201cPink grapefruit juice is rich in the antioxidant lycopene, which may provide skin-protective qualities and help maintain healthy skin,\u201d she says. Add a sprig of rosemary as a \u201cstirring\u201d stick and it may boost that benefit.\n\nAvoid: Processed cheese balls\n\nOh, how we all love to nosh on those bright orange cheese balls. However, Elizabeth Ann Shaw, MS, RDN, \u2014 author of Fertility Foods Cookbook+: 100 Recipes to Nourish Your Body \u2014 warns that they aren\u2019t going to do your body or skin any justice. \u201cCheese balls may be a mainstay on many holiday spreads this fall season. However, they aren\u2019t the healthiest,\u201d she explains. For one, those who are sensitive to dairy and experience an inflammatory reaction may be left with acne or other markers of skin inflammation from the cheese. Then there is the high sodium content typically found within dishes like this that also dehydrate your body.\n\nTry instead: Goat cheese with apple slices and walnuts\n\nIf you are craving cheese, try and get your fix with some goat cheese. \u201cGoat cheese is actually made up of only A2 beta casein protein, meaning it\u2019s less likely to cause an inflammatory response in those individuals who may be dairy sensitive to the A1 protein,\u201d Shaw tells us. Plus, apples are a fiber-fueling snack and walnuts are a heart-healthy nut, meaning this combination will leave you feeling full and satisfied without the breakouts you may see with an A1-protein-based snack.\n\nAvoid: Halloween candy\n\nWhether you are giving or receiving Halloween candy this year, it can be really hard keeping your hand out of the candy jar. But before you start snacking on all that sugar, Shaw urges you to consider how a handful here and there makes you feel. \u201cRelying on added sugar as your prime source of nutrition will leave you feeling rundown, sluggish and tired, three feelings we know reflect heavily in our skin,\u201d she points out. Plus, research shows that sugar intake can affect collagen, making it difficult to repair \u2014 and leaving the aftermath apparent in your complexion.\n\nTry instead: Dark chocolate and pistachio bark\n\nAccording to Shaw, dark chocolate and pistachios are an amazing duo. \u201cBy making your own candy you can control what goes into it, meaning nutrient-boasting ingredients in place of the added sugar and preservatives found in most candy bars,\u201d she explains. Why pistachios? The popular nuts are packed with antioxidants called polyphenols that give the nut its pretty green and purple hue. Antioxidants (like the flavonoids found in the dark chocolate, too) help keep the body in balance, moving free radicals, which can wreak havoc on your total health, out of your system.\n\nMORE: Vegan caramel apples are the answer to your dairy-free candy dreams\n\nAvoid: Red wine hot chocolate\n\nRed wine hot chocolate might be rich, comforting and jolly, but Shaw warns that the added sugar combined with the heavy cream is a combo that can leave many feeling not so jolly after their holiday party. Plus, alcohol is dehydrating to the body (and your skin).\n\nTry instead: Pomegranate mocktini\n\nConsider toasting to the holidays without alcohol. \u201cA mocktail gives you the best of both worlds: a wonderful celebration with friends and a night you\u2019ll remember,\u201d says Shaw. She suggests concocting a beverage with 100 percent pomegranate juice, which \u201chas the perfect holiday color thanks to those antioxidants.\u201d Research has found that pomegranate juice has, on average, more antioxidant capacity than red wine, grape juice or green tea. Mix with sparkling water for a bubbly delight that will hydrate, nourish and allow you to partake in the fun, too!\n\nLooking for a healthier holiday treat?
