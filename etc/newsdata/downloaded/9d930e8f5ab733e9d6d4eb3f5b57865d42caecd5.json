Musk said on a conference call that operating costs were the lowest since Model 3 production started.\n\nMargin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while productions costs are roughly the same as Model 3, said Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla chief financial officer.\n\nModel 3 vehicles made in the Shanghai factory will have roughly the same margins as those made in Fremont, California, he said.\n\nTesla also expects to generally be cash flow positive as it has grown to the point of being self-funding.

That's going to be really crazy growth.\"\n\nMusk also said Tesla is open to supplying batteries and other components to other automakers.\n\nWith Wednesday's after-hours surge, Tesla's stock has reduced its loss year-to-date to 8% and added about $9 billion to its market capitalization.\n\nBut Tesla rallies have been short-lived before.\n\nA year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors' expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PgxXgT)\n\nInvestors in the past have shown impatience with the company's serial failures to meet financial and production targets. Earlier this month, Tesla shares slumped after the company reported delivering 97,000 vehicles for the third quarter, only 2% ahead of the previous quarter.\n\nBut Tesla on Wednesday exceeded promises by billionaire Musk, who in July said Tesla would break even in the third quarter and turn a profit by the end of 2019.\n\nThe company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and on Wednesday said it was \"highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\"\n\nAnalysts have questioned how rapidly Tesla's vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets.\n\nKirkhorn on Wednesday said Tesla saw growing order rates in all markets, with current quarter orders exceeding those of the past three months.\n\nTesla has said it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new Chinese factory by the end of this year, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.\n\nRevenue fell nearly 8% to $6.30 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts had expected revenue of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTesla on Wednesday said it would gradually release nearly $500 million of accumulated revenue tied to its \"full self-driving capabilities\", which customers can buy for $6,000 even though fully automated driving is not available.\n\nKirkhorn on Wednesday said deferred revenue would also be released as Tesla expands its \"Smart Summon\" feature, which allows customers to operate a Tesla from 200 feet (60 meters) away using a smartphone app.\n\nFederal safety regulators are looking into the feature after videos began appearing online showing driverless Teslas hitting obstacles or nearly hitting other vehicles.\n\nMusk on Wednesday said software updates over the coming weeks would improve Summon.", "description": "Tesla shares soar 21% as surprise profit answers skeptics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M1ZV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
