Through the years, my husband and I have never made any police report on bad things said about us,\" she wrote, according to the Straits Times newspaper.\n\n\"It's a free country,\" she added.\n\nShe said she had reactivated her Twitter account after hearing about the arrest because she was \"angry and upset\".\n\n\"I myself told the Pihak Istana to inform the police to not take any action. I repeat again, I did not deactivate my account because of them,\" she said.\n\n\"My husband and I have never made police reports, and I have never been sad (when I read comments about me); instead I laugh because Allah knows who I am!\" she added.\n\nWhat happened to the activist?\n\nLate on Friday evening Khalid Ismath, a member of the Parti Socialis Malaysia (PSM) party, was arrested for allegedly posting offensive messages about the queen.\n\nHe was arrested under a 1948 sedition law - which has long been criticised by the political opposition and rights groups - and subsequently spent the night in a police station before being released on bail on Saturday.\n\nLawyers and local rights groups criticised Mr Ismath's arrest. Sevan Doraisamy, head of local rights group Suaram, said it amounted to \"nothing more than intimidation\" by police.\n\nPSM deputy chairman S Arutchelvan told the Straits Times that the arrest had been unnecessary and said Mr Ismath had denied insulting the queen.\n\nWhy did the queen leave Twitter in the first place?\n\nBefore briefly reappearing on Twitter, she posted on Instagram that she had left Twitter for personal reasons and not because she was offended at what people were writing about her. She also urged people against reporting posts to the police.\n\nHer Instagram post was shared on Twitter by her daughter.\n\nThe Raja Permaisuri Agong had been criticised on social media during Malaysia's Independence Day celebrations on 31 August for taking lots of photographs, with some saying she had \"behaved like a small child\", according to the Malaysia Star newspaper.\n\nBut she responded that the king had asked her to take the pictures.", "description": "The Raja Permaisuri Agong briefly returned to Twitter to urge police not to detain anyone else.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16CE3/production/_108811439_malaysiaqueen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
