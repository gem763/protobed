Of failure.\n\nLamar Alexander ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 1996 on the slogan of \u201cABC: Alexander Beats Clinton.\u201d He finished third place in the Iowa caucuses and dropped out before the \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d primaries.\n\nAlexander tried again in four years. That time, he didn\u2019t even make it to the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe 1996 election may seem like ancient history to folks, but how about 2016? Is that recent enough?\n\nBoth Jeb Bush and John Kasich were supposed to be more \u201celectable\u201d than Donald Trump and were explicitly sold on that basis. Both had experience governing large states. Both could \u201ccredibly\u201d challenge Hillary Clinton. And both went over like a led balloon with primary voters.\n\nWe can quibble with the judgment of those voters, but who exactly went on to be \u201celectable\u201d by defeating Hillary Clinton? Why, Donald J. Trump.\n\nIf you are going to make the case for electability based on polls, you\u2019re dancing on quicksand. Electability changes from poll to poll. The Biden campaign experienced a glimpse into its very likely future this week. Monmouth University released a poll showing Biden had dropped 13 points and was running third behind Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren. Fortunately for Biden, Monmouth later renounced its own poll and labeled it an \u201coutlier.\u201d But these events underscore the defect in Biden\u2019s strategy: He\u2019s one bad poll away from having to retool his campaign.\n\nPerhaps the Biden campaign believes the other Democratic candidates are so fatally flawed voters will inevitably see the light and choose the former vice president. This thought isn\u2019t outlandish (it\u2019s a pretty wacky bunch running for president). The problem is that Biden himself is fatally flawed. He commits a gaffe at every single campaign event. Literally. Just this week Biden thought he was in Vermont when he was actually in Keene, New Hampshire. And then he deviated from his prepared remarks babbling about what the world would be like if Barack Obama had been assassinated in 2008.\n\nWhat the Biden campaign is betting is that they can bluff their way into the nomination.\n\nBut what if primary voters are of a mind to call that bluff and go for another candidate who more clearly reflects their far-left values?\n\nA write-up for the progressive website Common Dreams admitted that \u201cthe former vice president has a commanding lead in national polls and in three early primary states Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.\u201d\n\nBut! \u201cSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) leads Biden in New Hampshire [and] the first contest, in Iowa, is still months away.\u201d\n\nCommon Dreams\u2019 bottom line was that \u201cwith a field of 23 candidates, Biden\u2019s lead is far from a sure thing,\u201d and many activists and interested parties have been less measured in their assessments.\n\n\u201cJill Biden may have settled for her husband,\u201d wrote New York magazine staff writer Sarah Jones, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure why anyone else should.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an important question that strategists on the Biden campaign should be answering right at this moment: If the \u201celectability\u201d of your candidate goes away, what\u2019s plan B? Do you even have one?", "description": "Joe Biden is setting a bear trap for himself by insisting that Democrats should back him solely on the \u201celectability\u201d issue.
