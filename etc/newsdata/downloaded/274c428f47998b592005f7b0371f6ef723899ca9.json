But then there were other months where I felt like I was being attacked every single day.\n\n'I eventually left him earlier this year, but he would still come around to my house abusing me. He told me that he would rather see me dead than be with anyone else.\n\nIn the latest incident Smith can be seen walking around the car swearing before head-butting the window\n\n'I ended up taking him to court after he assaulted me and kicked the wing mirror off my car with so much force it ended up at the other side of our house.'\n\nIn May that case came to Grimsby Magistrates Court when Smith admitted assaulting Ms Carter by beating, and criminal damage at her house in Immingham when he kicked a wing mirror off her car.\n\nMs Carter said: 'After that he received a community order and a restraining order that banned him from coming from within 50 metres of me. For a few months that worked, until he started just completely ignoring it.\n\n'I have seen him sitting at the bottom of my street, watching my house. He also constantly drives up and down the street watching my house, and when he does not do it, he gets his friends to. '\n\n'I constantly report the issues to the police, but nothing ever seems to be done about it. I have made countless statements and I am always told there has not been enough evidence to prosecute.\n\n'Instead, officers have told me to move house, change my car, move my car to a different location on my driveway to stop it being damaged and install CCTV and dashcam cameras. I am not made of money, I don't know how that would be a reasonable thing to ask me.\n\nMs Carter says that she is now speaking out in order to warn others and call for further action to be taken to protect the victims of domestic violence and abuse\n\n'There was even a time recently, when halfway through a statement I was giving to an officer, they told me that it would be a waste of time.'\n\nIn the latest incident Smith can be seen walking around the car swearing before head-butting the window.\n\nMs Carter says that she is now speaking out in order to warn others and call for further action to be taken to protect the victims of domestic violence and abuse.\n\nShe said: 'Something needs to be done to protect the victims of domestic violence, because it feels like we are being left to fend for ourselves.'\n\nIn response to Nikki's comments, Humberside Police Detective Chief Inspector Becky Dickinson said: 'We are aware of the reports and this is a live and ongoing investigation.\n\n'As part of that, an arrest has been made and therefore it would not be appropriate for us to comment on the specifics of this case, as to do so could potentially prejudice any future court proceedings.\n\n'What I can say is that we take all reports of domestic abuse incredibly serious, working hard to protect victims and bring offenders to justice.\n\n'If you are a victim of domestic abuse, or have concerns about someone you know, please call us on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.\n\n'If someone is in immediate danger always call 999.'", "description": "Nikki Carter (pictured) released footage of Lewis Smith confronting her two friends last weekend at a car park near Grimsby Railway Station before headbutting their car window.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20175862-0-image-a-42_1572001749277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
