I can't believe that. Some people have said 'Do you think this is true?'\n\n\"Coleen, I've met her at an event, she seems very nice. Rebekah Vardy, I've met Rebekah Vardy a few times.\n\n\"I'm just saying, and I'm not taking sides, but Coleen seems a bit like me. You don't say stuff unless you have evidence.\n\n\"Anyone I've outed is for a reason if they've really tried to damage me, for example my best friends when they betrayed me with the husband.\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\n\"Of course I'm gonna out them, I'm gonna name and shame them, put their name out there, pictures the lot. Why wouldn't you?\"\n\nKatie then said she felt sorry for Rebekah but doesn't understand why she would sell stories on Coleen if she is guilty.\n\nShe continued: \"I'm sorry to say, it's horrible Rebekah's getting all this s*** and everything like that, but I genuinely believe Coleen would not put this statement out unless she had evidence because she could get done for defamatory.\n\n(Image: Youtube)\n\n\"Rebekah's having a baby, she's heavily pregnant. There's no way, there must be truth in it, there's got to be.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say that, people can hate me. Do what you like, I'm used to it, troll me. There's got to be truth in it, that is hardcore.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Rebekah's reps for comment.", "description": "Katie argued that Coleen wouldn't have gone public with her claims against Rebekah if she didn't have evidence", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Youtube", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581894.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Katie-Price.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
