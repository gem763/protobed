While mercury levels less than 5 micrograms per liter in the blood are considered acceptable, the woman had 2,630 micrograms per liter in her blood, according to KCRA.\n\n\u201cIt came on very slowly,\u201d the son, who asked not to be identified, told CBS Sacramento. \u201cShe had mentioned just numbing in her lips, and numbing in her mouth, she had a lot of fatigue, very tired all the time, just wanting to be in bed.\u201d\n\nIn July, the woman went to the hospital after her symptoms, which now included slurred speech and difficulty walking, became worse. She eventually fell into a semi-comatose state and has remained there for weeks, according to KCRA.\n\nAlthough high levels of mercury are toxic, the heavy metal is found in some skincare products. \u201cMercury has been used in cosmetic products, as a preservative, as skin lightener, and with certain eye products,\u201d Susan Massick, dermatologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe FDA strictly regulates the use of mercury in products manufactured in the U.S. and limits its use in products. Unfortunately, products manufactured in or imported from countries outside the U.S., where regulations aren't as strict and the oversight is not as vigorous, can contain much higher levels that are unsafe and possibly even toxic and can lead to serious health complications.\u201d\n\nIf mercury is absorbed into the skin, people can develop skin irritation and allergic reactions, explains Massick. \u201cAt higher levels and with chronic use, there can be signs of neurotoxicity, including headaches, irritability, memory loss, tremors, numbness of extremities and lips, changes in vision and hearing, and depression.\u201d\n\nChildren and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to mercury\u2019s toxicity. According to the Sacramento Department of Health Services, children and babies can become very sick through contact with family members who use the tainted products.\n\nSo what can you do to protect yourself? The Sacramento Department of Health advises avoiding homemade or unlabeled creams, as well as brand-name containers that are not sealed when purchased. \u201cUnsealed containers could have been tampered with and may contain mercury,\u201d the department said.\n\n\u201cKnow the source of your products \u2014 buy from reputable companies and businesses,\u201d says Massick. \u201cBeware of online purchases where the prices are much lower than what you normally see \u2014 these discounted products may be knockoffs and potentially unsafe.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cAvoid buying products manufactured in and imported from foreign countries, particularly Mexico. If you are in a foreign country and tempted to buy products that look exactly like the American counterparts, chances are high that these may contain contaminants and, in some cases, toxic levels of chemicals that would be harmful to your health.\u201d\n\nOn its website, the Sacramento Department of Health Services shows images of several skincare products known to contain mercury. If you or a loved one has any of these creams at home, the Sacramento Department of Health urges people to stop using them immediately and get a blood and urine test from a doctor or healthcare provider. Place the cream in a closed Ziploc bag and contact your local health department.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A 47-year-old mom of five is in a semi-comatose state after getting mercury poisoning from a tainted skincare cream from Mexico.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_2Ilc7F1yAlyI26w8Lb1NQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/4ca7ca80-d4d8-11e9-abdc-0bc21044feb3"}
