Syndergaard spoke to the Mets over the weekend when Nido caught Marcus Stroman\u2019s start Saturday and Ramos started with Syndergaard pitching Sunday.\n\n\u201cI know in terms of pitchers and catchers, there\u2019s a certain it-factor, a relationship, a symbiotic relationship that two guys can possess,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about being comfortable out there.\u201d\n\nCallaway said he has not decided who will catch Syndergaard\u2019s next start, likely Friday against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but maintained \u201cwe\u2019re always going to try to do what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d He pointed to the team\u2019s results - the Mets are 9-6 when Syndergaard pitches to Ramos and 6-4 when he\u2019s paired with Nido.\n\n\u201cIt depends on what numbers you look at,\u201d Callaway said.\n\nSyndergaard said he has not said \u201canything major\u201d to Ramos about the report or his frustrations.\n\nThere\u2019s precedent for the Mets letting pitchers dictate battery mates. Last season, general manager Brodie Van Wagenen - then the agent for ace Jacob deGrom - encouraged deGrom to ask that Devin Mesoraco catch his outings, and Callaway obliged as deGrom won the NL Cy Young Award.\n\nSyndergaard agreed \u201ccompletely\u201d his preference for Nido or Rene Rivera is similar to deGrom\u2019s with Mesoraco.\n\n\u201cWatching what those two did last year was like watching Bob Ross paint,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cEverything was calculated and it was artful.\u201d\n\nManager Mickey Callaway said this year\u2019s situation differs because the club is competing. New York began the night four games behind the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild card.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different because Jake had a one-something ERA and was fighting for a Cy Young,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cWhere we\u2019re at as a team is much, much different.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest public frustration between the hard-throwing Syndergaard and the Mets. He\u2019s expressed disappointment over being mentioned in trade rumors, and also complained this spring when the club traveled to Syracuse for a public workout days before the regular season opener.\n\nSyndergaard is eligible for free agency after the 2021 season. Asked about his relationship with the front office, Syndergaard said \u201cas of right now, the 25, 40 guys in the clubhouse, that\u2019s my family.\u201d When pressed, he added that he respects the front office and is \u201cappreciative of the open dialogue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I can be stubborn at times, but it\u2019s just for I want the best for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to go out there and compete at the elite level that I think I can compete at. But yeah, I would say I\u2019m welcome and wanted here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mets starter Noah Syndergaard said Tuesday it was \"unfortunate\" his complaints to New York's front office and coaching staff about catcher Wilson Ramos were made public and he denied any role in leaking the conversations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Seiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/phillies_mets_baseball_33908_c0-126-3016-1884_s1770x1032.jpg?8f337b15343773ba7ff712f6261dd23d6019e088", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
