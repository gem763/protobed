She Did Not.\n\nThe article was by disgraced NYT authors Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly to promote their upcoming book \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d\n\nI do not normally report on sleaze but to understand what the NYT did, I have to.\n\nHere is one controversial paragraph.\n\n\"We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\n\nCoverup Whitewash\n\nThe NYT later added this correction.\n\n\"The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\n\nThat's one hell of a correction, don't you think?\n\nEditing Error\n\nMaking matters worse for itself, the NYT came out and blamed it all on an \"editing error\".\n\nReporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly said in an interview on MSNBC that they wrote in the draft of their Sunday Review piece that a woman who Kavanaugh was said to have exposed himself to while a student at Yale had told others she had no recollection of the alleged incident. Their editors, they say, removed the reference. \u201cIt was just sort of... in the haste of the editing process,\u201d said Pogrebin. The editor responsible for editing the Kavanaugh piece, Times Deputy Editorial Page Editor James Dao addressed select questions about the piece on a Times \u201cBulletin Board\u201d posted on Monday and updated Tuesday. But he did not address why the information about the woman\u2019s recollection was removed from the story. Dao declined a POLITICO request for comment.\n\nHalf Malarkey\n\n\u201cWe certainly never intended to mislead in any way,\u201d Pogrebin said in discussing the editor\u2019s note on MSNBC. \u201cWe wanted to give as full a story as possible.\u201d\n\nI know malarkey when I see it, and the whole story is malarkey. On second thought, make that half malarkey (I will explain in a moment).\n\nSince when do you post unsubstantiated sleaze of this nature when the people allegedly involved do not remember the incident?\n\nSomeone shoved a penis in my hand and I don't remember.\n\nReally?\n\nHere's the believable part: \u201cWe wanted to give as full a story as possible.\u201d\n\nRobin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly want to sell books, and sleaze sells.\n\nOf course they wanted as \"full a story as possible,\" and the more malarkey, the better.\n\nEntire Book Unravels\n\nZerohedge fills in the remaining pieces in his take As Kavanaugh Smear Unravels, Original Accuser's 'Witness' Now Doubts Story", "description": "As details emerge in the New York Times Kavanaugh scandal, .09/18/2019 19:20:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/281/073bf7c7-3196-41ec-9620-d5815ab13e5b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
