Let them write any nonsense they want to write about us. We know [the person] who writes their questions is Pravin.\"\n\n- Compiled by Jenna Etheridge", "description": "EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu has conceded that money from the now collapsed VBS Mutual Bank was used to fund his high-end Range Rover Sport, but insists that the money is clean, according to a report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2633/77a260eceac040d191654503f69c1978.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
