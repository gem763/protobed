But whatever Blizzard have planned they\u2019re surely going to pull out all the stops this year.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Blizzard gives back Blitzchung prize money, reduces ban to six months\n\nMORE: Diablo 1 available on GOG.com as more Blizzard classics planned\n\nMORE: Blizzard denies it cut plans to show Diablo 4 at Blizzcon", "description": "This year\u2019s Blizzcon looks like it\u2019s finally going to see an announcement for Diablo 4, and probably a remaster of the second game too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/81VRFW2iuL-1524x2060-cff5_1571645623.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
