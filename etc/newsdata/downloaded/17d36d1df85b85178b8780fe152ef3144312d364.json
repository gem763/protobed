The car reached a top speed of 1.1mph.\n\n(Image: University of Richmond/Getty)\n\n(Image: University of Richmond/Getty)\n\nResearchers found that rats reared in better cages with more toys and items to provide stimulation were the first to pass their \u201cdriving test\u201d.\n\nKelly Lambert, of the University of Richmond, said: \u201cMost of [the rats] learnt to drive to the goal, but not consistently enough to pass the experimental driving test. When trained more often, however, even the rats housed in standard housing conditions learnt to drive.\n\n(Image: University of Richmond/Getty)\n\n\u201cThis reminds us that our brains are dependent on interactive, engaging environments to facilitate optimal performance. Our neural networks crave informative experiences like our lungs crave air to function.\u201d", "description": "Researchers in Virginia have created the rat-operated vehicle (ROV) to test the creatures\u2019 abilities", "authors": ["Martin Bagot", "Image", "University Of Richmond Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_US-ANIMALS-RATS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
