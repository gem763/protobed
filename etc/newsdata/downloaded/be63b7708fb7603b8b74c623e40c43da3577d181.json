While the arms can be made to fit a diverse range of recipients, Unlimited Tomorrow focuses on creating kids\u2019 prosthetics\n\nTypical high-tech prosthetics can cost a family tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket, even with insurance considered, Ella Scarchilli, who does marketing for Arrow Electronics, told Dailymail.com at the Las Vegas tech show.\n\nUnlimited Tomorrow\u2019s device currently costs around $10,000.\n\nAnd, the company is hoping to slash the cost in half within the year.\n\nWhile the arms can be made to fit a diverse range of recipients, Unlimited Tomorrow focuses on creating kids\u2019 prosthetics.\n\nFor child amputees and their families, the costs of prosthetics can be astronomical over time, as they must buy new artificial limbs as they grow.\n\nThe new 3D-scanning and printing system, however, means the cost of a single high-tech prosthetic could drop from upwards of $100,000 to just $5,000.\n\nUnlimited Tomorrow\u2019s light-weight prosthetic arm has an adaptive grip and finger dexterity, and the firm is continually making improvements based on direct feedback from the children currently testing it out.\n\n\u2018We have advanced muscle sensors that are within the socket,\u2019 Scarchilli told Dailymail.com. 'You can flex your muscle and it reads that and turns it into an action for your fingers.'\n\nTypical high-tech prosthetics can cost a family tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket, even with insurance considered, Ella Scarchilli, marketing at Arrow Electronics, told Dailymail.com. Unlimited Tomorrow\u2019s device currently costs around $10,000\n\nTHE SPECS: Unlimited Tomorrow's device currently costs $10,000, though the company is working to bring this down to $5,000 within the year. It weighs just 1.5lbs, compared to upwards of 10lbs typical of prosthetic arms with similar built-in technology. It's equipped with: Muscle sensors\n\nAdaptive grip\n\nForce feedback\n\nCustom skin tone\n\nAI control system\n\nWireless charging\n\nIndividual finger control\n\n3-4 day battery life\n\n\u2018We just put an AI control system within it, so that if you're doing the same movements a lot daily \u2013 like drinking coffee, writing, etc \u2013 it's going to automatically realize those movements and store it,' Scarchilli said.\n\n\u2018Then, it's going to automatically do it.\u2019\n\nThe system charges wirelessly and has a battery life of about three to four days, the company says.\n\nIt also provides haptic feedback, meaning wearers will feel it vibrate to simulate the sense of touch.\n\nWhile similar prosthetics can weigh as much as 10 pounds, Unlimited Tomorrow\u2019s limb weighs just 1.5lbs.\n\nThe arm can be built without needing a trip to the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nSince it relies on 3D scanning, \u2018it can take the exact pigments of your skin and if you have discoloration, freckles, it can print just like that,\u2019 Scarchilli said.\n\nSince they\u2019ll then have all of your precise measurements, the firm can go ahead and print it up.\n\nAnd, the system is always getting better.\n\nThe team just recently finished its Indiegogo campaign, which allowed it to create 100 prosthetics for 100 amputees.\n\nFor child amputees, the costs of prosthetics can be astronomical over time, as their families must buy new artificial limbs as they grow. The new system, however, means the cost of a single high-tech prosthetic could drop from upwards of $100,000 to just $5,000\n\nUsing information provided to them by the people who are really using it, Unlimited Tomorrow is working to make its prosthetic as close to the real thing as possible.\n\n\u2018We go straight to the consumer because we care what they want \u2013 it\u2019s their arm, it\u2019s not the new iPhone XS Max,\u2019 Scarchilli told Dailymail.com.\n\nThe newest model on display at CES contained all of the edits from a girl named Zoe, who gave the firm a three-page letter of changes she was hoping to see made, according to Scarchilli.\n\n\u2018That's exactly what we want, because at the end of the day, we're not amputees and we don't know,\u2019 Scarchilli said. \u2018She wanted more movement in her wrist because it was very stiff, so the motors were transferred into the hand so she could move more.\n\n\u2018She wanted nails that you can interchange between short and long, so these are magnetized so you can take them off and on \u2013 you can even get them painted, with UV and gel.\u2019\n\n'We have really great technology,' she added, 'but we're for the people.'", "description": "Unlimited Tomorrow's new lower-cost method for creating high-tech prosthetics aims to make the devices much more accessible to amputees around the world \u2013 especially children.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald", "Annie Palmer For Dailymail.Com In Las Vegas"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/12/03/8425834-0-image-a-73_1547265316721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-12"}
