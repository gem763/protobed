Agencja Gazeta/Jakub Orzechowski via REUTERS\n\nNobody was hurt in the clashes but police said they had detained at least 30 people. Right-wing groups in Poland have expressed strong opposition to gay rights and have targeted such marches in the past.\n\nThe nationalist ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has made \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d a key issue in its campaign ahead of the Oct. 13 parliamentary elections, saying it is an invasive foreign influence that undermines traditional Polish values.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had death threats, (this violence) was about forcing us not to have this march,\u201d Bartosz Staszewki, organizer of Saturday\u2019s march, told Reuters.\n\nAs a helicopter circled overhead, television footage showed, riot police backed up a by water cannon separating the marchers, who brandished the rainbow flag of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community, from the protesters who had tried to block their route.\n\nProtesters tried to pelt the marchers with eggs, private broadcaster TVN 24 reported.\n\nMany pride marches have become battlegrounds, with riot police often having to protect marchers against counter-protesters. The mayor of Lublin had tried unsuccessfully to have Saturday\u2019s march banned, citing security concerns.\n\nOn Friday the Court of Appeal upheld the district court\u2019s decision to allow the march to go ahead.\n\nActivists and researchers say that the rhetoric used by the ruling party is homophobic and that its goal is to mobilize PiS\u2019s conservative base.\n\nPiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski has publicly urged Poles to resist the \u201ctraveling theater\u201d of Pride marches which he described as \u201ca real threat to... the Polish state\u201d.\n\nPiS officials have previously said they are not against gay couples, they just want them to exist solely in private. They counter charges of homophobia by saying they are responding to Polish public opinion, which remains conservative on the issue.\n\nA survey conducted in August by a global market research firm Ipsos for a Polish website OKO press found that the LGBT movement was ranked by Poles as one of the most serious threats to the country, second only to climate change.\n\nPiS has maintained a comfortable lead in polls for months with support of over 40%, according to a majority of recent polls.", "description": "Polish anti-LGBT protesters clashed with riot police in the south-eastern city of Lublin on Saturday just before a gay pride march that has highlighted increased social tensions in the devoutly Catholic nation ahead of an election next month.", "authors": ["Robert Furmanczuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434933158&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0M1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
