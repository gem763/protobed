(Eric Arnold)\n\nEarlier this summer, Eric Arnold, chief executive of Planswell, a start-up in Toronto, did what he occasionally does on LinkedIn. He wrote about a mistake he made as a manager and what he learned from it.\n\nThis time, he highlighted the importance of flexibility for his workers, particularly those with children.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ask if a candidate has kids.\n\nI forgot that during an interview \u2026\n\nThey paused, gave a weird look and said \u2018no.\u2019\n\nI forget people discriminate against parents.\n\nOur team has 15 kids, 4 of them are mine.\n\nWe might show up after 9 a.m. drop off. We often leave at 5 for dinner. We might run if school calls \u2026\n\nBut we do amazing work in between.\n\nWe don\u2019t succeed despite our families \u2026 We succeed because of them.\"\n\nHis post went viral. (H/T Working Mother Magazine.)\n\nOver the past year, Arnold has been sharing stories, hoping to show others that mistakes happen, and we need to take things from them. \u201cIt just feels good to be helping people,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this story \u2026 just stuck in my mind.\u201d\n\n[They left their corporate jobs to write kids' books in a barn. But fairy tale life is hard work.]\n\nThe backstory is that he and a job candidate were hitting it off. \u201cHe was my age and I asked if he had any kids, because I was excited to tell him about my kids,\u201d says Arnold, who has four children, ages 5 and younger. \u201cAs soon as it came out of my mouth, I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to say that.\u201d And the job candidate knew it, too. He gave Arnold a funny look, said no, and they went on with the interview.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t come to work for us, but after the whole process, he circled back and said \u2018My wife\u2019s pregnant, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling you that.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Arnold, it highlighted the fact that many people fear being discriminated against for having kids. They worry that it will be assumed they can\u2019t focus on work because they have another focus, one that may include midday calls from a school nurse, sitters that quit or parent-teacher conferences. But what Arnold wanted to get across in his post, he says, was \u201cAll I care about is that people do good work and bring a lot to the table.\u201d And that\u2019s true whether they are single and want to get home for their own reasons or are parents, he says.\n\nObviously, this wasn\u2019t so easily attainable in the not-so-distant past, when teleworking, laptops, smartphones and conferencing software weren\u2019t available. But now it\u2019s much easier to get the work done, even if there\u2019s a 3 p.m. pediatrician appointment, if a workplace is flexible enough. But changing the mind-set of many business leaders? Not so easy.\n\nAnd perhaps adding to an already large divide: Those working in fields that require face time, desk time and specific shifts can\u2019t hop in and out of the office as easily, Arnold acknowledges. \u201cEverything I\u2019m saying applies to creative-type jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a creative role, maybe you can do it in 10 minutes and if you create enough value, then it doesn\u2019t matter if you punch the clock.\u201d\n\nArnold says he knows remaining flexible is key as workplace demographics are changing and younger workers are coming in who often expect a different kind of environment than what was available in the past. And as co-founder of a start-up, he knew they had to create a smart workplace environment. Since launching in 2016, the company, which creates financial plans for people over the Internet, has grown to 56 employees \u2014 many with children. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have a choice. You really have to create an environment they want to work in,\u201d he says. \u201cGood talent is hard to come by. You want to create the best atmosphere and be accommodating to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe post resulted not only in \u201cthousands of private messages,\u201d Arnold says, but also a major uptick in job applications.\n\n\u201cI think if it\u2019s reaching people who feel like they\u2019re in a place where they can\u2019t be who they are, if they have kids, family, and they feel like they\u2019re being discriminated against, if it encourages them to go to work for another company \u2026 great,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it encourages CEOs to take a different perspective \u2026 I hope for the best.\u201d\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates.
