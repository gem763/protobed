(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nFirst came the poll taxes and whites-only primaries that targeted African Americans in this southeastern Texas community.\n\nIn recent decades, students at the historically black Prairie View A&M University were required to complete a \u201cresidency questionnaire\u201d to prove their eligibility to vote. They saw their power at the ballot box diluted when their campus was carved into separate districts. Some were arrested when they tried to cast ballots, accused of improper voting.\n\nThen came the 2018 midterm elections, when county leaders scheduled fewer early-voting hours on the university campus than in whiter communities nearby.\n\n\u201cHere we go again,\u201d Jayla Allen, a third-generation Prairie View student, thought angrily at the time. She and other students sued, determined to fight what they viewed as racial injustice just as others had done in the past, she said.\n\nFreighted with centuries\u2019 worth of mistreatment of African Americans, the debate over Waller County\u2019s election practices has emerged as a battle about more than just voting hours. The relatively narrow dispute tapped into deep feelings of marginalization and anger over long-standing efforts to keep black voters from the polls.\n\nThe intensity of the reaction in Prairie View echoes discussions across the country about racial inequality, which are prompting new examinations of past injustice to understand the present.\n\n\n\nJayla Allen, left, a senior at Prairie View A&M University, thought, \u201cHere we go again,\u201d when she learned of the early-voting schedule. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nWaller County Judge Trey Duhon, right, said the process was driven solely by limited resources and the need to serve a sprawling county. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cYou look at the history, and it inspires you and it draws you to action,\u201d said Allen, a 20-year-old political science major. \u201cI hate the fact that it\u2019s been consistent since the \u201970s, and here we are in 2019 fighting the same fight.\u201d\n\nWhat feels like prejudice to the A&M students is viewed very differently by Carbett \u201cTrey\u201d J. Duhon III, the local judge who helped determine the voting hours last fall.\n\nDuhon, who is white, said there is no question that discrimination has fueled past election practices in Waller County. But last year, he said, the early-voting schedule was driven solely by limited resources and the need to serve a sprawling county. And in the next election, he said, he is aiming to provide as much early voting in Prairie View as at the main county location.\n\n\u201cI understand how this looks,\u201d said Duhon. \u201cI can understand and appreciate the perception for someone who knows the history of Waller County. I just wish people would take the time to learn the facts and the truth today. This isn\u2019t your grandfather\u2019s or great-grandfather\u2019s county, not even close.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt kills me to be painted with a brush that I had nothing to do with,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nCars travel by the exit for Prairie View A&M along Highway 290. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nA county in transition\n\nOnce a center of slavery and cotton production, Waller County, population 51,000, is now a mix of rural prairie and Houston suburb. Proceeding west out of the sprawling city, the strip malls, subdivisions and towering interchanges quickly fade into mile after flat mile of pasture and cattle.\n\nWhat is now Prairie View A&M University was founded in 1876 to help freed slaves enter the workforce, according to university administrator Frank Jackson, 68, who lives in Prairie View and has served as mayor and county commissioner.\n\nNow, Prairie View is dominated by a campus of roughly 9,000 students, a flat expanse of low brick buildings and wide drives known for its engineering and nursing programs.\n\nThe university has long had to make do with less money than Texas A&M University in College Station, the flagship of the A&M system. The gap narrowed following protests and lobbying; today, the Prairie View campus boasts a sparkling new stadium, student center and housing.\n\nProgress on race relations is still evolving here. In 2015, Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old African American woman, died in the Waller County jail after she was arrested in a contentious traffic stop on her way to a new job at her alma mater, Prairie View A&M University. Although Bland\u2019s death was ruled a suicide, the rapid escalation of a minor traffic incident propelled the case into the national debate over law enforcement treatment of African Americans.\n\nLong before that case, Waller County was known for one of the highest lynching rates in Texas. Starting in 1923, whites-only primaries virtually excluded blacks from voting.\n\n\n\nCattle near the Prairie View A&M campus.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nEven after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the ratification six years later of the 26th Amendment, lowering the voting age to 18, Prairie View students faced barriers.\n\nIn the 1970s, a local election administrator demanded that students \u2014 but not other residents of Waller County \u2014 fill out a \u201cresidency questionnaire\u201d that asked, among other queries, if they owned property or paid taxes in Waller.\n\nThe students sued, prompting a landmark ruling from the Supreme Court in 1979 affirming their right to vote at school.\n\nIn 1992, 14 Prairie View students were charged with improperly voting, including one accused of voting twice \u2014 though one of the ballots belonged to his father, who had the same name. Following national attention, all the charges were dropped.\n\n\u201cWe know that Waller County has not been totally fair with these kids,\u201d said Jackson, sitting in his campus office surrounded by a crowd of students who gather daily to discuss current events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here 143 years now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe disparity is so blatant.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the ratification six years later of the 26th Amendment, lowering the voting age to 18, Prairie View students faced barriers, including a \u201cresidency questionnaire\u201d in the 1970s and charges of improper voting in the 1990s. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe fight over early voting\n\nAs the 2018 elections approached, the student government association and numerous political clubs organized rallies, voter registration drives and transportation to the polls.\n\nThen students noticed Prairie View, home to about 5,800 of the county\u2019s 33,000 registered voters, had fewer than half the days of early voting as three other neighboring cities. And those hours were split between a campus location and an off-campus community center.\n\n\n\nAllen attends a constitutional law class at Prairie View A&M. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAll three of those other cities \u2014 Hempstead, Waller and Brookshire \u2014 have larger proportions of white residents than Prairie View, which the Census estimates to be approximately 80 percent black. Overall, Waller County is about 70 percent white.\n\n\n\nAllen works on the computer in her dorm room. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAllen, center, with her friends, Maia Young, left, and Nathan Alexander, right. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe students appealed for more hours at a county board meeting. The commissioners voted no. A few hours later, the students regrouped around a table on campus to plot their next move.\n\n\u201cWe felt as though we were continuously fighting the same fight,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThen lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reached out to Allen and several other students: Did they want to be plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the county?\n\nTwo days after the students\u2019 suit was filed, the county agreed at a special meeting to expand early voting, opening a Sunday polling place at Prairie View City Hall and adding morning and evening hours on campus.\n\nFor Allen, it wasn\u2019t enough. Prairie View still had fewer early voting hours than other communities.\n\n\u201cThey want us to fall down and break,\u201d she told the Rev. Al Sharpton on his MSNBC television show. \u201cWe are strong. We are standing firm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFrustrated county officials had hoped the extended hours would lead to a resolution.\n\n\u201cEarly voting had already begun,\u201d Duhon recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t blow up the whole schedule. We were trying to work with the machines we had.\u201d\n\nTurnout in Prairie View mirrored the trend across the country last year: It was dramatically higher than it had been four years earlier. In the city\u2019s two precincts, 2,647 voters cast ballots, nearly three times more than in 2014, according to county data.\n\nDuhon remembers thinking that those numbers showed that voter access had not been impeded.\n\nLeah Aden, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who is helping litigate the case, said some voters have to work harder to surmount barriers to access \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean those barriers don\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cVoting access is still not equal in the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cSome voters have to jump over the finish line. Others run to the finish line unencumbered.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuhon, right, said he helped bring early voting back to Prairie View in 2016, and that long voting lines in the city that year prompted him to demand that voting machines be doubled last year. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n'Out of the dark ages'\n\nDuhon said that with limited funds, the goal was to provide convenient access to as many voters as possible. That meant spreading hours and equipment among communities. The county, for instance, offered fewer early-voting hours in the comparably sized city of Katy, which is majority-white.\n\nDuhon also said that long voting lines in Prairie View in 2016 had prompted him to double the number of machines in Prairie View during early voting last year \u2014 more than any other city in Waller County.\n\nHe disputed that the off-campus polling place in the city of Prairie View, a community center about a half-mile walk from campus, was inconvenient to students.\n\nFor Duhon, the allegation of racial bias was a personal affront.\n\nThe 49-year-old, who grew up in adjacent Fort Bend County, moved to Waller in 2005 to set up a private law practice. Elected in 2014 to lead the county\u2019s governing board, Duhon said he ran for office to \u201cget Waller County out of the dark ages.\u201d\n\nOne of his first acts was to reestablish early voting on Prairie View\u2019s campus in time for the 2016 elections, after years in which there was none.\n\n\n\nDuhon acknowledged that some in Waller County still view Prairie View students as a political threat. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nDuhon said he ran for office in 2014 to help bring Waller County \u201cout of the dark ages.\u201d (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nStill, Duhon acknowledged that some in the county still view Prairie View students as a political threat.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s always been this fear that if all the students voted, and they voted in a certain way, they could take over the county,\u201d he said.\n\nTommy Zorn, 67, a retired horse trainer sipping coffee in the Hempstead McDonald\u2019s on a recent morning, said voters should have to live in the county \u201ca certain amount of time\u201d before they can cast ballots. As he spoke, a woman on an white-and-tan spotted Appaloosa horse trotted up to the drive-through window and ordered a cup of coffee.\n\n\u201cI am the least prejudiced person in this county,\u201d Zorn said, \u201cbut the only reason they throw such a fit is so they can vote together and keep this county black.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuhon is working with Prairie View city officials and campus administrators to give the city as many early voting hours next year as anywhere else. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nPrairie View A&M administrator Frank Jackson meets with Allen in his office. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAn unresolved past\n\nAllen doesn\u2019t think Waller\u2019s white leaders understand how painful and resonant the county\u2019s history of discrimination is for its African American residents.\n\nHer family\u2019s own experience helps explain why the limited early-voting voting hours in Prairie View felt like so much more to Allen.\n\nHer parents had studied at Prairie View in the 1980s, when the campus was carved into three separate districts for county board seats. Her sister had studied there in the early 2000s, when a prosecutor declared that students were not automatically eligible to vote locally and that doing so could be a crime.\n\nThe gerrymandered districts were thrown out following a federal investigation. The prosecutor\u2019s warning about improper voting also led to a victory for students, following investigations by the state attorney general and U.S. Justice Department. The prosecutor apologized for what he admitted was \u201cthreatening\u201d behavior toward students trying to register.\n\n\u201cThis has been happening since 1978,\u201d said Prairie View alumnus Brian Rowland, now 40, a onetime plaintiff in that case who now serves on the Prairie View City Council. \u201cPart of it is about connecting the dots to the longer history. Prairie View students have always been challenged for their basic right to vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nA blank billboard stands between an American flag and a Texas flag along Highway 290 in Hempstead, Tex. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe fight over voting hours may become moot under a new Texas law requiring all satellite early-voting centers to remain open the same number of hours as main locations.\n\nDuhon said he is in talks with city and university officials to offer as many early-voting hours on Prairie View\u2019s campus as at the Waller County Courthouse about six miles away.\n\nIn other words, some early-voting centers that Waller offered last year could go away. But if he has his way, Duhon said, Prairie View will not be among them.\n\nAlice Crites in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "When students at the historically black Prairie View A&M University challenged the county about limited early-voting hours, they were also taking on Waller County\u2019s freighted history.", "authors": ["Amy Gardner", "National Political Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2wrQboAugaQ2qj4GkMKZdw_uJuE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6EBEVKGVBAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
