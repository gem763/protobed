Ten of the players have received training at top English Premier League clubs such as Arsenal and Leicester City.\n\nZhonglianchuan Primary School has two soccer pitches.

Soccer has helped her become more outgoing, especially after she received training in Britain.\"\n\nPrincipal Ma said: \"As teachers, we must value the dreams of every student. With more help from the government and society, I believe that the children's soccer dreams are coming true.\"\n\nXinhua", "description": "LANZHOU - The only \"teammate\" that 11-year-old primary school student Zhao Luting had to practice soccer with three years ago was a playful lamb.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e8fbaa310cf3e97a06cd9.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
