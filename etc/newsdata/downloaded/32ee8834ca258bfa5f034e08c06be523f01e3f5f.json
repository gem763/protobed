Bernie Sanders. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images 2020 Elections Bernie Sanders hits 1 million donors\n\nOne million people have donated to Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, his campaign said Thursday.\n\nHe is the first candidate to announce reaching that milestone.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"Our strength is in numbers, and that is why Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grassroots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump,\" Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. \"Like all campaigns we are beholden to our donors, and we\u2019re proud to stand with 1 million working people.\"\n\nSanders' team said more than 99 percent of his donors can contribute again because they have not yet given the maximum allowable donation. The campaign also said that 125,000-plus people are giving recurring monthly contributions to Sanders.\n\nThough he did not mention Elizabeth Warren by name, Shakir's statement could be interpreted as an effort to contrast the Vermont senator with his primary rival from Massachusetts, who has sworn off big-money fundraisers in the primary but said she would do what is necessary to compete with Trump in a general election. Sanders' team said he would not do high-dollar fundraisers at any point.\n\nWarren has announced in June that she received 1 million donations, but not 1 million individual donors.\n\nAccording to Sanders' aides, the top employer of his donors are Starbucks, Walmart and Amazon, and the most common profession is teachers. In counties that voted for President Donald Trump after supporting Barack Obama, the biggest employers are Walmart, the U.S. Postal Service and Target, the Sanders campaign said.\n\nIn 2008, Obama reached the 1-million mark in late February. In his first campaign for the White House, Sanders' campaign said he received donations from 1 million people by early January.", "description": "He is the first candidate to announce reaching that milestone.", "authors": ["Holly Otterbein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d7/ba/8c1439294852a85e38828b47cfd1/190919-bernie-sanders-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
