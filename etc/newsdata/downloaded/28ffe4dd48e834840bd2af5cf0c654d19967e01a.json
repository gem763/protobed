This is about what\u2019s going on at Mithril. This is about Mithril\u2019s investors, who are families, foundations, and charities that help the most vulnerable Americans, and the pension funds that permit our public servants to retire with dignity. These investors placed their trust and money in promises that were made by Mithril.\"\n\nShe added: \"I left Mithril earlier this year when it became clear to me that Mithril\u2019s leadership was lying to its investors and that the promises it had made were not going to be kept.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe suit seeks more than $1 million in relief.", "description": "A former child star and sister of actress Danica McKellar\u00a0is being sued for breach of contract after allegedly authoring a letter-writing campaign to bring down a venture fund owned by billionaire Peter Thiel.", "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "You Can Find Sasha Savitsky On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/peter-thiel-crystal-mckellar-reuters-courtesy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
