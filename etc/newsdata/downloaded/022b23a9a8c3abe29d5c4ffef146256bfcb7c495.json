(I would change that era\u2019s noun \u201cIMs\u201d to the current \u201ctexts,\u201d but otherwise could leave most of the language intact.) The \u201cPresident Strassburger\u201d I mention in the opening line was John Strassburger, a wonderful man and the illustrious president of Ursinus, who sadly died two years later, of cancer, at age 68.\n\nCommencement Address, Ursinus College, May 17, 2008\n\nJames M. Fallows\n\nPresident Strassburger; honored guests; deans and faculty members; family and supporters; and above all members of the Ursinus College class of 2008 \u2013 congratulations. You\u2019ve all worked, waited, and -- in your different ways -- sacrificed to make this day a reality. Speaking as the parent of two recent college graduates, I ask members of the Class please to turn and wave your recognition, and love, and thanks to the parents and other supporters who have stood behind you and are feeling boundless pride, and bittersweetness at seeing the adults you\u2019ve become, and relief of several kinds at the step you\u2019re taking now.\n\nI\u2019ve just done the first part of my job, in helping you notice this wonderful sunny day.\n\nI\u2019m about to do the second part, which is to be brief. Two days ago, I was in China, where I\u2019ve lived for two years and was involved in news of the disastrous earthquake. Two days from now, I\u2019ll be on my way back to Beijing. The reason I\u2019m here today is a connection between your college and my family that stretches back 65 years. I\u2019d like to tell that story and then say why I think it matters for you who are graduating today.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, 65 years ago, James A. Fallows, my father, had just graduated from Jenkintown High School, not far from here. He was 18 years old \u2013 in fact, tomorrow will be his 83rd birthday, and I\u2019ll join him in California to tell him about this event \u2013 and his country was at war. His older brother Bob was already in the Army. My dad\u2019s main choices were to become a military pilot or a military doctor. The placement tests said Doctor, and so he came to Collegeville as an Ursinus pre-med student and Navy cadet, under the V-12 program.\n\nHis time here was rich, as yours probably has been. He was on the football and wrestling teams. He acted in plays. He sang in the Messiah chorus \u2013 impressive, since he can\u2019t sing \u2013 and went to crack-of-dawn military drills when the bugle played Reveille on the campus. It was a different time.\n\nThe football team was successful, though they cheated, in a low-tech, pre-video way. He was a lineman, both offense and defense. He would wear a blue stocking on his right leg, and red on his left \u2013 and the man on either side of him on the line would do the reverse. The result was that linemen on the other team would look down and be puzzled, seeing a pair of blue or red legs that seemed to belong to two different people. When the ball was hiked, torsos and legs seemed to move in confusing directions. It helped Ursinus win, especially against academically less gifted teams. He liked it here.\n\nBut my dad\u2019s time here, if rich, was brief. After two years at Ursinus, he had finished enough pre-med courses to qualify, by competitive exam, for Harvard Medical School, where he enrolled at age 20. He went from there to be a Navy doctor, then a small-town doctor, husband for more than 55 years to his childhood sweetheart from Jenkintown, father to four children, pillar of the small community in California where he raised his family. The finest man I know.\n\nBut because of the rushed wartime schedule, unlike today\u2019s members of the class of \u201908, my father never graduated from Ursinus. Until three years ago when the college, in a gesture that meant a tremendous amount to people now in their 80s, awarded its V-12 students their diplomas. I had hoped my dad could join us today, which he can\u2019t \u2013 but I know that as you get your diplomas, he\u2019ll be looking at his, mounted on his living room wall.\n\nI tell you this because I\u2019m a proud son, as sons and daughters should be \u2013 but also because his time in Collegeville, compared with yours, helps me introduce three ideas I\u2019d like to mention briefly. They have to do with the times you\u2019ll live in and the traits you\u2019ll show, and I think of them as: challenge; curiosity; and character.\n\nWe hear almost too often about the challenges that shaped my father\u2019s generation \u2013 the grandparents of today\u2019s graduates. They grew up during the Depression, the then they fought a long world war and cold war. As if that weren\u2019t enough, then they had to raise the Baby Boomers, my own unpopular generation. Their times were tough \u2013 for instance, the life expectancy for an American man born in 1925, like my father, was only into his mid 50s\u2014twenty years less than for someone born in 1986, like most of you.\n\nBecause of the way this \u201cgreatest generation\u201d \u2013 your grandparents, my parents \u2013 met it challenges, we honor them, but I think we sometimes misunderstand what challenge can mean. We\u2019re tempted to think that it takes extreme challenge to bring out the greatness in people \u2013 Pearl Harbor, 9/11 - and, correspondingly, that when times do really get tough people will automatically rise to their best.\n\nI\u2019m not sure about either assumption. Sometimes people and societies don\u2019t in fact rise to meet their biggest tests \u2013 I fear our nation\u2019s overall response to the challenges of 9/11 will be seen, in history, as falling into this category\u2013 and sometimes the real test of greatness in people and generations is coping with challenges that don\u2019t take the obvious Pearl Harbor form.\n\nThis, I think is your generation\u2019s chance for greatness. You already know some of the huge array of problem which, if they\u2019re going to be solved at all, will require your minds and commitment and talent and self-sacrifice. Perhaps number one is preserving the global environment, and its range of species, and its climate system \u2013 every day in China I see reasons why that\u2019s crucial and difficult. Every day in China I also see a billion-plus people struggling to condense a century of economic development into a few years. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re struggling to \u201ctake American jobs\u201d or \"threaten America\u2019s place in the world\u201d \u2013 they have too many problems of their own, as we\u2019re reminded by the devastation there just this week. But they are changing your world.\n\nI\u2019m actually optimistic about your America\u2019s prospects in dealing with China\u2013 and with India, and with the Middle East, and with questions of global harmony and domestic equality \u2013as long as we newly embrace rather than stifle the traditional American virtues of openness, equality, innovation, and opportunity. And as long as you recognize the challenge to serve \u2013 not in the V-12 but in your era\u2019s ways. Perhaps in the military, as a teacher, as a parent, as an entrepreneur, as volunteer. Sixty-five years from now, many of you will be back here, and you\u2019ll want to hear that you were a greatest generation too.\n\nSecond, curiosity. My dad always knew that he had been pulled out of Ursinus too soon. And that was a huge advantage. Having missed half of his normal college education, he gave himself ten educations in the ensuing years. He taught himself Greek, and then Hebrew, and polished up his Latin \u2013 and there were more. He became a painter, and sculptor, with his work in shows. He taught himself to sail, and play the piano, and to become a cowboy and head of local mounted police. He took up computers in his 50s and became a local webmaster. Now, at 83, he\u2019s wondering whether to switch to the Mac.\n\nHe went overboard, because that\u2019s who he is \u2013 but his is an extreme example of what a great college education should do for everyone. You\u2019ve had a vastly better education than he had here, because you\u2019ve had it in full and because Ursinus itself has is now so justly celebrated for the excellence of its life-changing undergraduate approach. You\u2019ve shared an intellectual bond from Gilgamesh onward. But these years will have been wasted, Gilgamesh and all, if they\u2019re not the beginning of a process of curiosity-driven self education that lasts the rest of your lives.\n\nYou can use your upcoming reunions as a handy benchmark. At each five-year interval \u2013 your 5th reunion, your 50th \u2013be prepared to tell your classmates about the new thing you\u2019ve recently learned. Guitar; Arabic; the tango; whatever. Here\u2019s another benchmark: by the time of your 10th reunion, please spend at least one year overseas. There is no better way to learn about your own country than to see it from afar.\n\nThird, character: Your parents know what I have learned from seeing my own children grow: that a lot of what we are as people, we are from the start. But we\u2019re pushed to be the best versions of our inborn possibilities by parents in the beginning, then by teachers and mentors, and in the long run by ourselves.\n\nProbably because he was so busy rushing through Ursinus, my dad \u2013 like another practical-minded Philadelphian, Benjamin Franklin \u2013 always emphasized that our character is the accumulation of things we actually do each day. In the end, we are our habits, so it\u2019s worth developing good ones.\n\nSome are obvious. Seriously, don\u2019t smoke! Or, type IMs while you drive. Get in the habit of sports and exercise \u2013 by your tenth reunion, you\u2019ll know who has and hasn\u2019t. Get in the habit of being happy. We all have problems, which we can\u2019t control; what we can control is how we look at them. Get in the habit of being excited. It\u2019s a big world, with no excuse for being bored. It\u2019s fun to have feuds and enemies \u2013 I\u2019ve had my share\u2013 but break the habit of nursing grudges. Here\u2019s a tip: always write angry letters to your enemies. Never mail them. Remember that anything hostile you say about people will get back to them. Especially if it\u2019s in email.\n\nMoney: you\u2019re going to have enough of it. Use the privilege of this education to know that you\u2019re not going to starve, so you might as well spend your life doing something you love and are proud of. By your 20th reunion, and even more your 50th, you\u2019ll see that satisfaction in work and family is scarcer \u2013 and far more rewarding \u2013 than the money race can ever be. Some people will always be better off than you, so don\u2019t waste time envying them. Instead think of those you admire \u2013 and construct your own personal Mt. Rushmore, seeing what traits you can emulate.\n\nTake every chance to tell your spouse, when you have one, and your children that you love them. When in doubt, phone your mom.\n\nOne final habit: Whenever you have the chance to deliver a sincere compliment, be sure to do it. My father is proud to be from Ursinus; I am proud of you; and we all are proud of you new graduates. These are sincere compliments, every one. Make the most of this wonderful day. #", "description": "", "authors": ["James Fallows"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2019/09/02109v/facebook.jpg?1567782084", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
