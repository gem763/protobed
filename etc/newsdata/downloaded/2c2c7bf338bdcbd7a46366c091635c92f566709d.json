Two activists failed to obtain a court injunction on Friday against the ban on face coverings, which the government says have made it tough for police to identify radical protesters.\n\nIn a second bid, Dennis Kwok said a group of 24 legislators filed a legal appeal to block the anti-mask law on wider constitutional grounds.\n\nHe said the city's leader Carrie Lam acted in bad faith by bypassing the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's parliament, in invoking the emergency law.\n\nHe said: 'This is a Henry the 8th situation. This is basically I say what is law... and I say when that ceases to be law. That's not how our constitution works.\n\n'We say that she doesn't have such powers, that she cannot avoid' the Legislative Council.\n\nThe court will hear the case on Sunday morning.\n\nMs Lam has said she will seek the council's backing for the law when its session resumes on October 16, and she has not ruled out further measures if the violence continues.\n\nasked protesters dance near Mong Kok Police Station.

Throughout the afternoon and evening crowds gathered in masks\n\nMany shopping centres, shops and the entire MTR network of subways and trains that usually handle more than four million trips a day shut on Saturday following the overnight rampage.\n\nMany peaceful protesters say violence has become a means to an end, the only way for young masked protesters to force the government to bend to clamours for full democracy and other demands.\n\nBut the shooting of the teen on Friday night - the second victim of gunfire since the protests began in early June - stoked fears of more bloody confrontations.\n\nAn 18-year-old protester was also shot at close range by a riot police officer on Tuesday.\n\nPeople protest a ban against masks in Sham Shui Po by shining the light son their phones\n\nA group gathers in Sham Shui Po as they defied the mask ban in yet another night of political turmoil and unrest\n\nPolice said in a statement on Saturday that the 14-year-old, who was hospitalised with a gunshot wound on his thigh, has been arrested for participating in a riot and assaulting a policeman.\n\nPolice have said they are still investigating exactly how he got shot.\n\nProtesters in masks popped up in the central business district on Saturday afternoon, carrying a yellow banner marked 'Glory to Hong Kong' and shouting: 'Hong Kong, resist.'\n\nThere were other scattered gatherings, with some holding hands in a long human chain and chanting anti-police slogans in an open-air stadium.\n\nTrouble brewed as night fell, however, with police saying pockets of protesters again blocked roads and vandalised shops and public property in several districts but left before police arrived.\n\nPolice said no arrests had been made so far on the anti-mask ban but did not explain why.\n\nProtester numbers Saturday appeared down from previous weekends when tens of thousands flooded the streets. Some marchers said the protest movement that has become a big headache to Chinese President Xi Jinping was merely harbouring strength for the long haul.", "description": "Thousands of protesters staged unsanctioned marches and flashmob protests at multiple locations in Hong Kong, a day after the city's leader outlawed masks at protests.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/20/19341524-0-image-a-32_1570305341919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
