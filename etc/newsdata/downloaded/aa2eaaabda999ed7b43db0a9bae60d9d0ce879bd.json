And there\u2019s no room for that kind of thinking if we\u2019re all going to live off-world.\n\nIn fact, the \u2018huge baggage\u2019 of our earthly problems has been condemned by the founder of the first ever \u2018space nation\u2019.\n\nIn October 2016 Russian billionaire Dr Igor Ashurbeyli announced the creation of Asgardia, and in June 2018 he was inaugurated as its head.\n\nThere are currently 20,000 verified citizens from around 200 countries, who have each received a Certificate of Asgardia.\n\nAsgardia is a space nation with its own politics (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia)\n\nThe space nation wants to be free of earthly baggage (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia)\n\nOpening Asgardia\u2019s first Space Science and Investment Congress in Darmstadt, Germany, Dr. Ashurbeyli set out the priorities as long-term space exploration and settlement in space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018It would be dangerous to take on this long space journey the huge baggage of earthly problems accumulated over millennia. We simply cannot afford militarisation of space by projecting earthly borders onto it.\n\n\u2018One should realise that only about 20 countries out of 229 have access to space. This is discrimination of space calibre against the countries which are unjustly called \u2018the third world countries\u2019 and against their citizens.\n\n\u2018And even simpler \u2013 against earthlings and Asgardians.\u2019\n\nAsgardia was created in 2018 (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia)\n\nHe added that the nation is capable of bringing global democracy to space science, saying scientists are constricted by national legislation. Dr Ashurbeyli told the congress the main \u2018visionary and scientific mission\u2019 of Asgardia is the birth of the first human child in space.\n\nThe space nation wants to bring about the first birth of a human child in space (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia)\n\nHe continued: \u2018I will start by brushing aside hypocritical speculations about risks of childbirth for both mother and child. We simply owe this chance to ourselves now, when planet Earth is pretty much explored, and how finite human existence is on earth is already recognised.\n\n\u2018All the magnificent projects for settlement of Mars and similar extravaganza are a one-way ticket in the absence of the first human child.\u2019\n\nWhat is Asgardia? One of the first Asgardian projects will be the creation of a network of satellites to protect the Earth from space hazards such as asteroids, solar flares and orbiting man-made debris. Asgardia is named after the City of the Gods in Norse mythology. Its main aim is to develop space technology unfettered by Earthly politics and laws, leading ultimately to a permanent orbiting home where its citizens can live and work. People can apply online to be Asgardian citizens via the website http://www.asgardia.space. Those already recognised as citizens are now being asked to vote on key elements of the Asgardian constitution. Asgardia-1, launched on November 12, 2017, was roughly the size of a loaf of bread, measuring just 20cm (eight inches) long and weighing about 2.3kg (5lbs). It contained a solid state hard drive containing the citizen data of the first Asgardians and two particle detectors for measuring radiation levels in space.\n\nWould you like to go to Asgardia? (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia)\n\nDespite the lofty goals of Asgardia, some prominent scientists have come out against the idea of humankind trying to migrate to another planet or live among the stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNobel prize winning astrophysicist Michel Mayor has suggested that humans will never leave Earth.\n\n\u2018If we are talking about exoplanets, things should be clear: we will not migrate there. These planets are much, much too far away,\u2019 he told Agence France-Press.\n\nSwiss astrophysicist Michel Mayor, center, has received the Nobel Prize 2019 in Physics (Picture: Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP)\n\n\u2018Even in the very optimistic case of a livable planet that is not too far, say a few dozen light years, which is not a lot, it\u2019s in the neighborhood, the time to go there is considerable.\n\n\u2018We are talking about hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today.\u2019\n\nRather than jumping on the Asgardia bandwagon, the 77-year-old said issues like climate change are far more serious.\n\n\u2018We must take care of our planet,\u2019 he urged.", "description": "Asgardia is a space nation without earthly borders", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89948576_1571134535.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
