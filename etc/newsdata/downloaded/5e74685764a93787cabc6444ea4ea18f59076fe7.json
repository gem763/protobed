It was not certain that Kurdish forces had abandoned the region, despite claiming to have done so.\n\nTurkey's president vowed Wednesday to continue operations if Kurdish groups do not withdraw.\n\n\u201cIf we see that the members of the terrorist organization have not been moved out of the 30 km, or if attacks continue, no matter from where, we reserve our right to carry out our own operation,\" President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Trump administration announced earlier this month that U.S. troops would withdraw from the region now occupied by Turkish forces, a move widely condemned in Washington as a betrayal of Kurdish forces that aided a U.S.-backed coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nTrump himself has defended the decision, pointing to his campaign promise to withdraw the U.S. from so-called endless wars in the Middle East.", "description": "Turkish forces reportedly clashed with Syrian government\u00a0troops in northeastern Syria on Wednesday,\u00a0signaling that a peace deal brokered by Russia between Kurdish forces in the region and\u00a0Ankara may not hold.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syriaturkeymilitaryaction_101519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
