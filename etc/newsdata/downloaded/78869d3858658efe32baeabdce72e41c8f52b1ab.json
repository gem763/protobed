They don\u2019t have a ton of competition this season. Both statements can be true.\n\nThe NFC is deep. You can make a strong argument for multiple teams being the best in the conference. Good, quality teams will be left out of the playoffs in the NFC. There are championship-level teams at the top and a lot of capable teams throughout.\n\nThe AFC might not have two good teams.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWeek 8 provided more evidence that the Patriots might not even sweat in Foxborough this January on their way to another Super Bowl:\n\n\u2022 The Buffalo Bills, the only AFC team other than the Patriots with fewer than two losses heading into Week 8, were blown out by a 3-4 Eagles team at home. Advanced metrics don\u2019t love the Bills, and they didn\u2019t look good on Sunday.\n\n\u2022 The Kansas City Chiefs lost their third home game in a row. Yes, Patrick Mahomes was out. But the Chiefs have lost two home games with Mahomes, and their defense is still not great (while acknowledging their injuries on defense have made a big difference).\n\n\u2022 The Houston Texans just lost J.J. Watt for the rest of the season.\n\n\u2022 The Indianapolis Colts struggled at home to beat a bad Denver Broncos team, needing a last-minute 51-yard field goal to pull it off. The Colts have also lost to the Raiders at home.\n\n\u2022 The Baltimore Ravens ... well, we\u2019ll see.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Ravens have their shot in Week 9 to give Patriots haters some hope. They host the Patriots on Sunday night, coming off a bye. Baltimore has a mixed bag of results (beating a lot of bad teams and sometimes barely getting by them, getting blasted by the Browns at home, but coming off a very impressive road win at Seattle) but they do present matchup issues. Lamar Jackson is unique and hard to stop. The Patriots have been phenomenal against conventional offenses, but this is a different challenge.\n\nHere\u2019s the scary thought: What if the Ravens get blown out? Then what?\n\nA healthy Chiefs team is probably the best remaining candidate to beat the Patriots. Maybe it\u2019s the Texans just because Deshaun Watson is insanely good and seems capable of anything. Aside from the old \u201cany given Sunday\u201d cliche, there\u2019s no good reason to believe any other AFC team can come within 10 points of New England at home in the playoffs. Mahomes and Watson are the only reasons those teams even have a puncher\u2019s chance.\n\nAnd to be clear, the road to the Super Bowl is very likely to go through New England. The only realistic scenario for a team other than the Patriots getting the No. 1 seed, outside of major injuries, starts with a Ravens win on Sunday. Baltimore would be just one loss behind New England with the tiebreaker. However, if the Patriots win they\u2019d be up at least three games on every AFC team other than the Bills and Colts, who have two losses each. And nobody should believe the Colts or Bills are going to pass the Patriots.\n\nSometimes the AFC East\u2019s incompetence outside of New England is overstated by fans who want to discount the Patriots\u2019 dynasty. The AFC East\u2019s bumbling isn\u2019t the only reason the Patriots have been great, or even one of the top few reasons. But it does help. The Patriots haven\u2019t had a serious challenger in the division for a long time.\n\nThe same might be true about the entire AFC this season. It doesn\u2019t mean the Patriots aren\u2019t great. Their defense could be historic, and their offense is pretty good too. But it\u2019s also true that nobody else in the AFC looks very good. Maybe that changes with a Ravens upset in Week 9, or perhaps Mahomes or Watson can have a day for the ages against the Patriots in January. But we\u2019re not even halfway through the season and anyone hoping to avoid the Patriots on Super Bowl Sunday this season should be running out of hope.\n\nBill Belichick and his New England Patriots are the AFC's clear favorite. (Getty Images)\n\nHere are the Power Rankings after Week 7 of the NFL season:\n\n32. Miami Dolphins (0-7, Last week: 32)\n\nI can\u2019t believe that defensive call near the end of the first half on Monday night. Leading 14-3, with Pittsburgh facing a third-and-20 with 26 seconds left, Miami called an all-out blitz. Behind that, their defensive backs played off. Diontae Johnson had one of the easiest 45-yard touchdowns ever, and that changed the entire game. It\u2019s hard for a defensive call to be so bad that everyone can see it, and that was definitely one of them.\n\n31. Cincinnati Bengals (0-8, LW: 31)\n\nThe Bengals will be interesting to watch before the trade deadline. They desperately need to move some of their veteran pieces for picks. A.J. Green comes to mind. But there has been little buzz about the Bengals making a move, and we probably shouldn\u2019t expect them to do the smart thing.\n\n30. Washington Redskins (1-7, LW: 30)\n\nPerhaps Washington stalling on trading Trent Williams was some master stroke that drives up interest at the deadline. I\u2019m just going to go with the Redskins being oblivious to that fact despite everyone else understanding it for months.\n\n29. Atlanta Falcons (1-7, LW: 29)\n\nMatt Schaub threw for 460 yards, which is kind of bonkers. And yet Atlanta scored only 20 points. I\u2019ve never seen a team that is so good at piling up yards but at the same time so bad at scoring. And winning.\n\n28. Denver Broncos (2-6, LW: 25)\n\nJoe Flacco has a neck injury and won\u2019t start this week. It was always confusing for the Broncos to waste a mid-round pick to \u201cupgrade\u201d from Case Keenum to Flacco, but Denver is about to look unsightly bad without Flacco.\n\n27. New York Jets (1-6, LW: 28)\n\nThe game script was bad but still, nine carries for Le\u2019Veon Bell? Also, if this team trades receiver Robby Anderson they\u2019ve lost their minds. That\u2019s the type of guy Sam Darnold needs as he develops. Adam Gase just needs to use him better.\n\n26. New York Giants (2-6, LW: 27)\n\nThe Leonard Williams trade is another that\u2019s hard to grasp from a big-picture standpoint. Williams\u2019 contract is done after the season. The Giants could have just signed him then and not given up picks. It\u2019s hard to justify moving a third- and fifth-round pick just to have an exclusive negotiating window with Williams. Though the Giants can recoup a compensatory pick if Williams signs elsewhere. We\u2019ll see what comes next with Williams and the Giants.\n\n25. Cleveland Browns (2-5, LW: 24)\n\nFreddie Kitchens was a boom-or-bust hire. It wasn\u2019t an outrageous decision at the time, but it was a risky one. Sometimes risky moves don\u2019t work out. This one clearly isn\u2019t working out, and it\u2019s starting to feel like Kitchens has nine games to save himself from being one-and-done.\n\n24. Arizona Cardinals (3-4-1, LW: 23)\n\nThe Cardinals have won some games, but they\u2019re still miles behind the other three teams in the NFC West. They\u2019re rebuilding. So why are they trading a draft pick for Kenyan Drake, whose contract expires after this season? How does that logically fit in their organizational philosophy?\n\n23. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-5, LW: 22)\n\nIt\u2019s entirely understandable why Bruce Arians isn\u2019t happy that a quick whistle cost his team what should have been a touchdown. Maybe that leads to a win and the Bucs are 3-4 and not 2-5. That\u2019s a huge difference.\n\n22. Los Angeles Chargers (3-5, LW: 26)\n\nFor once, a close game went the Chargers\u2019 way. That Tennessee loss in Week 7 is really hard now. They win that, they\u2019re 4-4 and only a game behind the Chiefs in the AFC West.\n\n21. Pittsburgh Steelers (3-4, LW: 21)\n\nMason Rudolph rebounded after a really bad start. But he still hasn\u2019t looked like a future franchise quarterback, or an above-average starter, at any point. Minkah Fitzpatrick is a good player, but it still seems Pittsburgh will regret sending its first-round pick to Miami when 2020 should be a quarterback-heavy draft.\n\n20. Oakland Raiders (3-4, LW: 17)\n\nThe Raiders battled, but Deshaun Watson was just a little too much. It happens. The Raiders looked a little out of gas at the end of a long road trip. We\u2019ll see if they look rejuvenated during a three-game homestand that starts this week.\n\n19. Tennessee Titans (4-4, LW: 20)\n\nRyan Tannehill wasn\u2019t as good as he was in his first start, but still moved the Titans and made some plays. He\u2019s clearly better than Marcus Mariota. Maybe he is working his way into the team\u2019s 2020 plans.\n\n18. Chicago Bears (3-4, LW: 15)\n\nIt did not take long for the shine to come off Matt Nagy, did it? This week brings another round of criticism, especially with his decision to settle for a 41-yard field goal with a well-documented shaky kicking situation. Vic Fangio was perhaps the best coordinator in the league last season. Maybe the NFL coach of the year award went to the wrong guy? It\u2019s too early to bury Nagy, but there are more questions about him now.\n\n17. Detroit Lions (3-3-1, LW: 19)\n\nThe Lions threw on all 13 third downs Sunday, and Matthew Stafford was 12-of-13 for 200 yards on those plays (h/t to Kyle Meinke of MLive.com). Stafford also didn\u2019t throw an incompletion after halftime. Stafford has a 105.3 passer rating, and he has never finished north of 100 over a full season in his career.\n\n16. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-4, LW: 18)\n\nNick Bosa is getting a lot of attention and rightfully so, but fellow top-10 pick Josh Allen had two more sacks on Sunday. He has seven sacks, and at least one sack in four straight games. It\u2019s not too early to wonder if the Raiders blew it passing on him with the fourth pick when everyone thought Allen would be Oakland\u2019s selection.\n\n15. Carolina Panthers (4-3, LW: 13)\n\nThat should end the Kyle Allen-Cam Newton debate. Allen will start again this week according to Ron Rivera, but that\u2019s because Newton isn\u2019t healthy. Allen\u2019s job until Newton is ready is making sure Newton has a playoff contender to come back to. It won\u2019t be easy in the deep NFC.\n\n14. Philadelphia Eagles (4-4, LW: 16)\n\nThis is how the NFL goes: You can look horrible and finished one week, then get one big road win and the entire picture changes. The Eagles had a pretty good road win over a Bills team that had only lost to the Patriots this season. The Cowboys have a tough remaining schedule. As cooked as the Eagles looked after that horrible loss at Dallas, they\u2019re right back in the race.\n\n13. Houston Texans (5-3, LW: 14)\n\nJ.J. Watt will be 31 years old next season and has finished three of the last four seasons on injured reserve. Watt is a generational talent but there will be plenty of questions about how he\u2019ll bounce back and if he can stay healthy.\n\n12. Los Angeles Rams (5-3, LW: 12)\n\nCooper Kupp has at least 100 yards in five games this season and had 220 on Sunday. He\u2019s on pace for 116 catches, 1,584 yards and 10 touchdowns. And he\u2019s coming off a torn ACL. Quite an amazing season.\n\n11. Dallas Cowboys (4-3, LW: 11)\n\nThe game this week at the Giants is at least a little tricky. And it\u2019s crucial, considering the tough games the Cowboys have after that. It wouldn\u2019t be in their best interest to drop one of the rare games on their schedule in which they\u2019ll be expected to easily win.\n\n10. Kansas City Chiefs (5-3, LW: 7)\n\nIt\u2019s not like the Chiefs want to lose games, but losing Sunday night wasn\u2019t a big deal. The AFC West is putrid. There\u2019s no worry there. There is some concern about not getting a first-round bye, but it\u2019s not like anyone is good enough to run away with it.\n\n9. Buffalo Bills (5-2, LW: 6)\n\nJosh Allen had 169 yards on 34 attempts against an Eagles defense that has not been great against the pass. Allen ranks 26th of 28 quarterbacks with 200 attempts in Pro Football Focus\u2019 grades, besting only Case Keenum and Mitchell Trubisky. Just a reminder that Allen hasn\u2019t arrived quite yet.\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (5-2, LW: 10)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty, but the Colts had a letdown spot after a big win over the Texans and still escaped with another win over the Broncos. And with J.J. Watt\u2019s season-ending injury, the Colts are the clear favorite in the AFC South.\n\n7. Seattle Seahawks (6-2, LW: 9)\n\nAssuming the Seahawks can beat the Buccaneers at home on Sunday, the Nov. 11 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup at the 49ers should be perhaps the best one ESPN will get this season.\n\n6. Baltimore Ravens (5-2, LW: 8)\n\nThe Ravens had the bye week to get in some extra preparation for the Patriots. They\u2019ll need a very good game plan to do any damage against the best defense in the NFL.\n\n5. Minnesota Vikings (6-2, LW: 5)\n\nHere\u2019s where the line of true Super Bowl contenders seems to start (though an exception can be made for the Chiefs once everyone is healthy). The Vikings weren\u2019t great last week against Washington, but didn\u2019t need to be. Minnesota seems underrated because of skepticism over Kirk Cousins, which is justified. But this is a very good team.\n\n4. Green Bay Packers (7-1, LW: 4)\n\nIt needs to be pointed out again that Aaron Rodgers has gotten hot without Davante Adams. No receiver stood out for the Packers on Sunday night and Jimmy Graham is a shell of his old self. Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Geronimo Allison combined for two catches and 11 yards and have mostly proven they\u2019re not capable of stressing a defense. And yet, Rodgers has been brilliant two straight weeks. He\u2019s back in the MVP conversation.\n\n3. San Francisco 49ers (7-0, LW: 3)\n\nThe Emmanuel Sanders acquisition will help, and the Niners should still be asking around for more receiver help. They\u2019re a Super Bowl contender. You don\u2019t know when that window closes. Imagine how good this team could be with, say, A.J. Green?\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (7-1, LW: 2)\n\nThe 49ers have been very good but the Saints still deserve the top spot in the NFC. Especially since we saw Drew Brees come back and look like he never had thumb surgery. And the Saints could get injured running back Alvin Kamara following their bye.\n\n1. New England Patriots (8-0, LW: 1)\n\nBrowns running back Nick Chubb had 131 yards on 20 carries. That\u2019s about the first negative thing to be said about the Patriots\u2019 defense halfway into their season. Presumably they\u2019ll have the run defense fixed before facing the Ravens.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
