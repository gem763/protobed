It was the players who were close to Suarez in the dressing room and they wanted to support their mate.\n\n\"What I would say maybe I look at myself and say I didn\u2019t have the courage as an individual to say I wasn\u2019t wearing it. I don\u2019t think everyone within LFC thought we were doing what was right.\n\n\"As with your own family, as a football club, your first reaction no matter what someone does is to protect even when you know they have done something wrong. And that is wrong.\n\n\"I\u2019m not in any way condoning what we did with Suarez, it\u2019s wrong. But it doesn\u2019t matter what instance, it is that is the first reaction, and apologies we got it massively wrong.\"", "description": "Former Reds striker Suarez was hit with an eight-game ban for racially abusing Evra in 2011", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670266.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/507870493_x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
