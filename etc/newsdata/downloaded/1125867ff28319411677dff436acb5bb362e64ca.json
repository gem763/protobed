That decision has sparked bipartisan criticism that the decision betrays the Kurds, while giving a boost to ISIS.\n\nDEMS STORM OUT OF SYRIA MEETING WITH TRUMP: 'WE HAVE TO PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH'\n\nPelosi on Thursday gave her account of what happened, telling reporters during a Capitol press conference that she asked Trump what the plan was in Syria -- to which Trump said his plan was \u201cto protect America,\u201d which Pelosi said was only a goal. She also asked why, if the goal was to bring troops home, troops were also being sent to Saudi Arabia.\n\nShe also said that she had told Trump that, with him, \u201call roads seem to lead to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\u201d\n\nPelosi noted that the Russians have been trying to get a foothold in the Middle East for a while, which she says they now have achieved. She also said that Putin benefits from any withholding of aid from Ukraine -- which Trump had tried to do over the summer, before it was overturned by Congress.\n\n\u201cRussians benefited, Putin did, when the president placed some doubt about our commitment to NATO right from the start of his administration,\u201d she said. \u201cAll roads lead to Putin.\u201d\n\nThe apparent reference to Putin having some sort of hold over Trump suggests that Pelosi was ready to punch just as hard as Trump when it came to tarring a political opponent, and gives a glimpse of how the meeting devolved so quickly.\n\nA senior Democratic aide told Fox News that Trump began the meeting, which was ostensibly called by the White House, by remarking that \"someone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it.\" Trump also reportedly told Pelosi, \"I hate ISIS more than you do,\" prompting Pelosi to respond, \"You don't know that.\"\n\nSchumer said that the walkout happened after Trump referred to Pelosi as a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d As the Democrats walked out, Trump reportedly remarked \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the polls.\u201d\n\nTrump responded to the Democrat walkout on Wednesday by showing photos of the meeting, with the caption: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d Pelosi subsequently made it her banner on her Twitter profile.\n\nHe also tweeted out a picture of Pelosi, Hoyer and Schumer looking angry, with the caption: \u201cDo you think they like me?\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed the reports about the meeting.\n\n\"The President was measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi's decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising,\" Grisham said. \"She had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues. While democratic leadership chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine, everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room and work on behalf of this country.\"\n\nRUSSIAN MILITARY PATROLLING SYRIA-TURKEY BORDER AS US TROOPS OFFICIALLY WITHDRAW\n\nPelosi meanwhile made similar suggestions about Trump\u2019s health to those that Trump made about her own health.\n\n\"I pray for the president all the time, and I tell him that -- I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now, we have to pray for his health -- because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president,\u201d she said.\n\nThe relationship between the president and the speaker has worsened in recent weeks with the announcement by Pelosi of an impeachment inquiry into Trump's actions in relation to Ukraine. But the meeting is not the first that has devolved into name-calling and raised voices. In December, a similarly fiery meeting played out in front of reporters in the Oval Office as they clashed over government funding for the wall on the southern border -- where Trump threatened to shut down the government.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSchumer raised his voice, claiming he could pass measures to keep the government running regardless, as Trump said he was \"proud to shut down the government for border security\" and will \"take the mantle.\"\n\nPelosi noted at the time, \"This has spiraled downwards.\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., heated up their ongoing war of words after a White House meeting on Syria on Wednesday devolved into name-calling and led ultimately to Democrats storming out.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/17/694940094001_6095485238001_6095491758001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
