That\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\nSmith has previously criticized his own network\u2019s journalistic integrity, saying that Fox employees \u201con the opinion side\u201d could say \u201cwhatever they want\u201d as they\u2019re expressing opinion, not fact.\n\nWatch the newest blow between the two below:\n\n\"Partisanship as news coverage\": @TuckerCarlson hits back at Shepard Smith for scolding him as \"repugnant\" for not defending Judge Napolitano on-air.https://t.co/wCx5ckDZ5K pic.twitter.com/zni6YsGwY1 \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 26, 2019", "description": "Carlson just raised the stakes in the increasingly nasty back-and-forth between the two Fox News hosts.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8c6a0f220000e60151e3c1.jpeg?cache=wkr8bkwfek&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
