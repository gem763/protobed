(Reuters) - Hurricane Dorian, downgraded to a Category 1 but still packing 90 mph (150 kph) winds, crawled north on Friday, skirting the Carolinas and flooding coastal towns a couple of days after it reduced parts of the Bahamas to rubble.\n\nThe eye wall of the weakening Hurricane Dorian was scraping the edge of Cape Lookout, N.C., just 30 miles (50 km) west-southwest of the state\u2019s Outer Banks islands at 7 a.m. EDT on Friday.\n\nThe hurricane does not officially make landfall until at least half of its eye crosses land, the National Hurricane Center said. It could still make landfall later Friday morning, forecasters said.\n\nIt lashed the Outer Banks with hurricane-force winds as far as 45 miles from the center of the hurricane and sent tropical storm winds farther than 200 miles from its center, National Hurricane Center in Miami said in an advisory.\n\nIt has already dumped up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain along the coast between Charleston, S.C., to Wilmington, N.C., about 170 miles away, forecasters said.\n\n\u201cThe rain is moving up north,\u201d said NWS forecaster Alex Lamers early on Friday. \u201cEven the Raleigh-Durham area inland will get 3 inches today.\u201d\n\nDorian is expected to push out to sea later on Friday and bring tropical storm winds to Nantucket Island and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts early on Saturday.\n\nBut it will likely spare much of the rest of the east coast of the worst of its rain and wind, before likely making landfall in Nova Scotia that night, the NHC said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the process of moving out, going north,\u201d Lamers said.\n\nResident Dabny Babbs checks on the status of his sail boat docked along the Ashley River during Hurricane Dorian in Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., September 5, 2019. REUTERS/Randall Hill\n\nThe howling west flank of Dorian has soaked the Carolinas since early Thursday, flooding coastal towns, whipping up more than a dozen tornadoes and cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nFloodwaters rose to a foot (30 cm) or more in parts of the historic South Carolina city of Charleston, where more than 7 inches (18 cm) of rain fell in some areas, officials said. Another half-inch or more was expected overnight Friday.\n\nMore than 330,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina and South Carolina on Friday morning. Power had mostly been restored to thousands of people in Georgia, tracking site poweroutage.us showed.\n\nBut as Dorian is expected to pick up speed from its 14 mph (22 kph) crawl on Friday, life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds remain a threat for much of the area and Virginia, the NHC said.\n\nGovernors in the region declared states of emergency, shut schools, opened shelters, readied national guard troops and urged residents to heed warnings, as media circulated fresh images of the storm\u2019s devastation in the Bahamas.\n\nAt least 70,000 Bahamians needed immediate humanitarian relief after Dorian became the most damaging storm ever to hit the island nation.\n\nIn the Carolinas alone, more than 900,000 people had been ordered to evacuate their homes. It was unclear how many did so.\n\nIn Kill Devil Hills in the Outer Banks, Mark Jennings decided to ignore the order, lining his garage door with sandbags and boarding up his home with plywood.\n\nThe retired firefighter planned to stay put with his wife and two dogs, saying: \u201cWe are ready to go. If something happens, we can still get out of here.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nDorian whipped up at least three tornadoes in the region, officials said. One in North Carolina damaged scores of trailers at a campground in Emerald Isle, but no one was injured, the News & Observer said.\n\nOf at least four storm-related deaths reported in the United States, three were in Orange County, Florida, during storm preparations or evacuation, the mayor\u2019s office said.\n\nIn North Carolina, an 85-year-old man fell off a ladder while barricading his home for Dorian, the governor said.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian, downgraded to a Category 1 but still packing 90 mph (150 kph) winds, crawled north on Friday, skirting the Carolinas and flooding coastal towns a couple of days after it reduced parts of the Bahamas to rubble.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426898879&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8513B", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
