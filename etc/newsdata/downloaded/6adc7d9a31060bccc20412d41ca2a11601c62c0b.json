The first bit of news is that on July 24th, an asteroid (named 2019OK) that\u2019s bigger than a football field passed by the Earth at a distance of 40,400 miles. That\u2019s less than one fifth the distance from the Earth to the moon. In astronomical terms, that\u2019s an extremely near miss. If it had hit us it wouldn\u2019t have been an extinction-level event like the dinosaurs faced, but it would have done one hell of a lot of damage no matter where it came down.\n\nThe second part of that story is possibly more alarming. Despite NASA having spent years tracking all of the dangerous asteroids in near-Earth orbit, nobody saw this one coming until 24 hours before it arrived. Even if we had some grandiose (and as yet fictional) plan in place to divert killer asteroids, there\u2019s no way we could have even gotten our shoes laced up before that one would have been setting the world on fire. This led Buzzfeed to ask how these giant rocks keep sneaking up on us. An FOIA request to NASA produced some of the background conversations taking place at the agency.\n\n\u201cThis object slipped through a whole series of our capture nets,\u201d Paul Chodas of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote in an email to his colleagues two days after the July 25 flyby, describing what he called the \u201csneaky\u201d space rock. \u201cI wonder how many times this situation has happened without the asteroid being discovered at all.\u201d The emails were obtained in response to a Freedom of Information Act request and provide a detailed, behind-the-scenes look as NASA officials scrambled to figure out why the asteroid wasn\u2019t spotted until it was nearly whizzing past Earth. Other emails show internal agency scientists frustrated by a media response that called the event a \u201ccity killer\u201d that \u201cjust missed the earth.\u201d \u201cThis one did sneak up on us and it is an interesting story on the limitations of our current survey network,\u201d Johnson wrote in a July 26 email.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to point fingers, we probably shouldn\u2019t be so quick to pin the blame on NASA. One of my favorite radio hosts, Micah Hanks, believes that dumping the blame on NASA for this miss is shortsighted. In fact, it\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re finding and tracking so many of these rocks as it is.\n\nPart of what makes these \u201cnear misses\u201d so disturbing is that we\u2019re seeing them at all. As our asteroid detection capabilities continue to improve, what we\u2019re actually seeing is a better success rate at spotting these objects, whereas in the past they might not have been seen at all. The really sobering idea is to think of how many more times in the past there were larger\u2013or closer\u2013objects that sped past Earth without us having so much as an idea\u2026 It\u2019s easy to see why people would be worked up about news of a \u201cnear-miss\u201d like what happened with 2019 OK. However, rather than a failure on part of NASA and other space agencies around the world, if anything, it\u2019s a clear indication that our planetary defense science is steadily improving.\n\nI find myself landing somewhere between these two schools of thought. Like Micah, I believe that NASA is doing the best they can with what they have. And as time goes by, we\u2019re probably going to get even better at detection and potentially interception. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t some room for improvement. Or \u201cblame,\u201d if you wish.\n\nBack in 2005, Congress passed a law ordering NASA to begin tracking the majority of dangerous asteroids passing close to us. And they\u2019ve made remarkable progress since then. But as Buzzfeed correctly points out, in order to really fulfill that mission, NASA has requested (and needs) larger and more advanced telescopes and spacecraft to get the job done. Congress has failed to follow through with the funding for those resources.\n\nSo if there\u2019s any blame to be thrown around here, we should probably aim it Congress. They\u2019ve turned the search for near-Earth asteroids into at least a partially unfunded mandate. They can probably do a much better job but they\u2019ll need more than two dixie cups attached by a string. At the same time, we might all need to adjust our expectations and stay grounded in reality. While it may be distressing, I\u2019ll circle back to a sobering quote from Micah in the article linked above. \u201cIn the eventual sense, a space object large enough to be able to cause widespread damage will strike the Earth\u2013it\u2019s not a matter of if, but simply one of when.\u201d", "description": "Clever for a rock", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/asteroid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
