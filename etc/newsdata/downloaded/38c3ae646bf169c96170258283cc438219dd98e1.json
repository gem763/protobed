Her family said she had suffered \u201cnightmares and trauma\u201d after finding out that she had been filmed at the hospital without her knowledge.\n\nA statement from her family said she had made an \u201cextreme choice\u201d.\n\nA clinical pathologist at the same hospital was arrested in August for allegedly filming female co-workers in the employees\u2019 changing room. Police allege he made a hole in the changing room wall to film the four victims.\n\nThey are investigating a link between the allegations against the pathologist and the woman\u2019s death.\n\nSouth Korean TV star resigns after spycam scandal Read more\n\nThe woman is among thousands of South Korean victims of \u201cmolka\u201d, in which women are covertly filmed and the footage uploaded to websites visited by men who often pay subscription fees to access the illegal films.\n\nIn 2017, there were a reported 6,400 cases of illegal filming reported to police in South Korea, up from 2,400 in 2012.\n\nEarlier this year, two men were arrested for secretly filming 1,600 people in 30 hotels across 10 cities in South Korea. The films were uploaded to a subscription website.\n\nNa-Young Lee, a professor of sociology at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, saidSouth Korean women were increasingly alarmed by the molka epidemic.\n\n\u201cThere are cameras everywhere \u2013 from toilets to motels, houses where you are living alone, to school, and these pictures or film footages are distributed on pornography sites while you are not aware of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are combined with other graphic images to be pornographies and circulated again.\u201d\n\n'A part of daily life': South Korea confronts its voyeurism epidemic Read more\n\nThe molka crisis has sparked widespread protests in South Korea. In August last year, 70,000 people marched in Seoul with signs stating \u201cmy life is not your porn.\u201d\n\nLee said many women felt that the police and prosecutors were not taking the cases seriously.\n\n\u201cEven [if] they make a report to police, [police] just dismiss the case and men are soon released,\u201d she said. [Women] insist there are biased investigations and rulings involved.\u201d\n\nLee pointed to a case last year where a female model was sentenced to 10 months in detention for filming a male colleague and deliberately posting his pictures online, while in a similar case with the genders of the perpetrator and victim reversed, there was just a 2m won fine.\n\n\u201cThe spy cam itself is problematic, but the attitude of police prosecutors and the judges who are dealing with the cases are also problematic.\u201d\n\nJosh Taylor travelled to South Korea as part of the Walkley Foundation\u2019s Australia-Korea journalist exchange program in partnership with the Korea Press Foundation.\n\n\u2022 In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
