Lawmakers have also requested companies\u2019 financial information and records from any previous government investigation into their competition practices.\n\nA bipartisan group of committee members made the request, including Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, and its ranking Republican, Doug Collins, Georgia.\n\n\u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,\u201d Mr. Collins said in a statement.\n\nMr. Nadler said the documents will provide the committee with a better understanding of whether tech companies are using their market power \u201cin ways that have harmed consumers and competition.\u201d\n\nA Google spokeswoman referred to a blog post authored earlier this week by Kent Walker, the company\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs. Mr. Walker vowed Google would cooperate with all investigations into its practices.\n\n\u201cGovernments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have always worked constructively with regulators and will continue to do so,\u201d Mr. Walker continued.\n\nThe request comes as the committee ramps up its scrutiny of tech giants. Attorneys general from 50 states on Monday unveiled their own bipartisan antitrust probes into Google and Facebook. That investigation will focus on whether \u201cdominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct online.\u201d\n\nFederal regulators have also increased its scrutiny with both the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department launching investigations into the firms\u2019 conduct.\n\nA group of tech executives testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee in July, but the subcommittee\u2019s chair, Rep. David Cicilline, said they still need more information.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s document requests are an important milestone in this investigation as we work to obtain the information that our members need to make this determination,\u201d the Rhode Island Democrat said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
