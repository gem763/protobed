Mr Latimer left Norton Rose last year and is now a partner in the Sydney office of international law firm Bird & Bird.\n\nKerenga Kua, PNG's Petroleum Minister and a former attorney-general, said the role of all those involved in the controversial deal would be examined.\n\n\u201cEverybody who had a role to play will be the subject of scrutiny in this inquiry,\u201d Mr Kua has previously said.\n\nPNG Prime Minister James Marape established the royal commission after coming to power in May and said it would be \"digging deeper\" into the \"entire UBS transaction\".\n\nA key area of focus will be the role former prime minister Peter O'Neill, who championed the deal and ensured it proceeded without parliamentary approval and with limited support from cabinet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn arrest warrant for the former prime minister was issued on Wednesday on charges of \"official corruption\", although it is unclear what this involves.\n\nA report released by the Ombudsman Commission of PNG in May found the loan could have breached 15 laws, and labelled it \"highly inappropriate\" and \"speculative\".\n\nThe Ombudsman said the deal to purchase the Oil Search shares was \"irregular\" because of the lack of consultation with state agencies and the bypassing of parliamentary approval.\n\nIt was critical of the role played by Mr O'Neil and Mr Marape, who was the finance minister at the time.\n\nDespite the potential for further findings against himself, Mr Marape has appointed a heavyweight panel of local and Australian lawyers.\n\nRetired Australian Federal Court judge John Gilmour QC will sit as a \"second commissioner\" alongside chairman Sir Salamo Injia.\n\nPerth barrister Matthew Howard SC has been appointed counsel assisting the royal commission, while his junior counsel is fellow West Australian Alexander Mossop.", "description": "The role of the Australian arm of UBS and law firms Norton Rose and Ashurst will be examined by the PNG royal commission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2405%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3be240fcecd8886b9d6a0d181037fbb985d2cb28", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
