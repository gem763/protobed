The launch had been planned prior to the scenes in Sofia on Monday, when England twice stopped their Euro 2020 qualifier after monkey chants from far-right Bulgarian fans. However, Richard Masters, the league\u2019s interim chief executive, said the defiant stand by England\u2019s players in enacting the first stage of Uefa\u2019s protocol was a shining example. \u201cI couldn\u2019t quite believe what I was seeing,\u201d he said, citing the Nazi salutes and chorus of monkey chants. \u201cI thought it was terrible. I thought that ITV, the players, Gareth and the FA dealt with it in an exemplary fashion.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe Premier League is hoping its two-week awareness campaign will encourage fans to be more proactive in tipping off stewards about offensive language and abuse.\u200b\n\nWork also includes reviewing how offenders are identified, investigated and sanctioned, the league said. CCTV coverage at grounds and body-worn cameras will be deployed more widely at clubs to track down culprits. Footballing bodies have also been holding meetings with Twitter in a bid to increase security against racist trolls.\u200b", "description": "Some of the England players who stood up to the racists in Bulgaria are among the faces of a Premier League campaign imploring fans to help combat the crisis at home and abroad.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000192431486-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGs3zev8Pa37rdawpKZuaT-OxrOV0qB3SOSC8gKHJoN4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
