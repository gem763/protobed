More than 40% of the super savers and pre super savers said they drive older vehicles, live in a modest home, travel less than they prefer, and do DIY projects instead of hiring outside help. Of the super savers specifically, a whopping 70% began saving in their 20s.\n\nThey also have something else in common: They seek professional help for their money. Forty-one percent of super savers and 42% of pre super savers say they work with a financial adviser, while 21% and 20%, respectively, say they plan to in the future.\n\nWhile the majority of savers use online tools to verify whether they're on track for retirement, more than one-fourth say they consult a financial adviser to compare information.\n\nBut surprisingly, these savers also say their advisers don't have significant influence on their savings habits \u2014 that honor goes to their parents, their spouses, and themselves.\n\nFinding the gumption to start saving for retirement at 25 can be challenging \u2014 no one wants to feel like they're sacrificing the joys of today for the promise of tomorrow. Financial advisers help clients strike a balance between taking care of priorities today and setting up a rich future.\n\nA survey from Northwestern Mutual found that 61% of people who work with financial advisers have \"clarity on balancing spending now vs. saving for later,\" compared to 50% of people who don't work with a professional.", "description": "People who come close to maxing out their 401(k)\u00a0plans have a few things in common, including their tendency to seek out financial help.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88decc2e22af11cb4ffc67-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
