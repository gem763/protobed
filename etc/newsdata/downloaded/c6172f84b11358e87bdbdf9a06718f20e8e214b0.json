I feel for the Bulgaria people I genuinely do, but you have to look at the banners the stadium half closed down, it does nothing. We have said it for many years.\n\n'UEFA do not really deep down care about the punishments they\u2019ve put out. This should have been in place ten years ago, 20 years ago. It was not done and now we have seen what has happened.\n\nEngland all but ensured their qualification for Euro 2020 with a comprehensive 6-0 victory\n\nFans perform a Nazi salute despite repeated warnings about the match being stopped if that racist behaviour continued\n\n'We have got a generation of players, not just black players, and people who will not tolerate it no more. My generation was the generation of turn the other cheek, of Martin Luther King.\n\n'This is the by any means necessary generation, the Malcolm X generation. They have their own platforms and now they have the protocol to stick to.\n\n'I feel really good watching this.\n\n'I\u2019ve played games with racism going on and people say beat them on the pitch.\n\n'It doesn\u2019t do anything, you don\u2019t beat them on the pitch, I have scored two goals against teams and they have still given me racist abuse. You don\u2019t win. Today they own because the fans had to leave.'", "description": "Ian Wright was proud of England's players for taking action after receiving racist abuse.\u00a0 The match against Bulgaria had to be halted twice after monkey chants were heard.", "authors": ["Jack Kinnersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19710888-0-image-a-43_1571087284707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
