But you can demo Death Stranding The Umbrella.\n\nFull disclosure: Even though it\u2019s overcast here today at the Tokyo Game Show, I was not able to test this demo umbrella outside in the rain.\n\nWhile Death Stranding The Video Game is a PlayStation 4 exclusive, Death Stranding The Umbrella is not. Designed for wet weather, it can also be used as on sunny days to help block out the sun\u2019s rays or during snowy weather to fend off the cold. This Death Stranding is multi-platform.\n\nWhile in its sheath, the title Death Stranding is clearly legible. The all-black cover builds up to some anticipation. Is there a black umbrella inside? Or will Kojima throw us a curveball?\n\nSince I\u2019d had seen the demo version on the Tokyo Game Show floor, so I was not surprised to find that the umbrella itself was black.\n\nOne of the weakest parts of Death Stranding The Umbrella is that when closed, it is not possible to read Death Stranding. I am sure this won\u2019t be a problem when opened.\n\nThe handle is made from soft-touch plastic. Considerable development must have gone into this.\n\nLet\u2019s press the button and see how this story unfolds.\n\nWow! While this was one of Hideo Kojima\u2019s easier to follow endeavours, it proves that he is a master of raingear surprises.\n\nAt its core, Death Stranding The Umbrella is just that, an umbrella. In many ways, we\u2019ve seen this before. You open it. You close it. The umbrella keeps you dry. He\u2019s not departing from the tried and true formula, but this umbrella is well-made with a nice twist when opened.\n\nBut, isn\u2019t it bad luck to open umbrellas indoors?\n\nDamn you, Kojima.\n\nDeath Stranding The Umbrella is priced at 4,500 yen ($61). You can demo it for yourself at this year\u2019s Tokyo Game Show.", "description": "Hideo Kojima\u2019s upcoming release Death Stranding isn\u2019t playable at the Tokyo Game Show.
