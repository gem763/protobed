He can\u2019t hurt anybody anymore.\u201d\n\nBuck, 65, would face a minimum of 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nCLINTON, OBAMA SILENT ON ED BUCK DONATIONS\n\nA criminal complaint and accompanying affidavit detailed multiple allegations that Buck injected men with meth against their wishes during sexual encounters. The investigation found at least 10 alleged victims, several of whom described in salacious detail Buck\u2019s apparent fetish to pay men to use drugs and have sex, which often took a dark turn and led to several suspected overdoses.\n\nBuck has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California political candidates, Gov. Gavin Newsom and others, and is well known in LGBTQ political circles. Some activists argued his political ties and the race of the victims spared him from prosecution.\n\n\u201cHe was found naked and dead on a mattress in Ed Buck\u2019s house,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cMy child is not here. \u2026 I have to live with this. My son died here. My child died here. \u2026 I am dying on the inside.\u201d\n\nShe said her son told her about Buck \u201cscreaming and crying.\u201d\n\nThe story sounded crazy to her, and it took her some time to realize her son wasn\u2019t lying. \u201cAs a mother I am trying to find out, somebody help my kid.\u201d\n\nShe said her son went to authorities but they turned her son away.\n\nMoore had moved back home with his mother in Texas two years ago and was missing in Los Angeles when he texted a photo of a syringe in an arm to a wealthy gay man he knew in California.\n\nBuck, an influential political activist more than twice Moore\u2019s age, later replied: \u201cBe here now.\u201d\n\nBuck bought a plane ticket for Moore and had a car pick him up a week later at the airport. By sunset, Moore, 26, would be dead on a mattress on the floor of Buck\u2019s Los Angeles-area home.\n\nNixon is happy Buck\u2019s case was picked up by federal authorities. She said Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey didn\u2019t do her job.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming. I am glad the feds got it,\u201d she said. Lacey \u201cdragged her feet. It appalled me \u2026 that she tried to take credit for work she didn\u2019t even do.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County District Attorney's Office spokesman Greg Risling said in response to Fox News via email: \u201cThe District Attorney\u2019s Office has been working with both the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to bring all provable charges against defendant Buck. Defendant Buck was charged in federal court because federal law makes it a crime to furnish drugs if the drugs cause death. California state law does not provide for a similar charge.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added: \u201cThe District Attorney\u2019s Office is legally and ethically required and committed to only bring charges that have sufficient, admissible evidence to convince an objective jury of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. After reviewing all of the admissible evidence, our prosecutors determined that there was insufficient evidence to pursue homicide charges against defendant Buck at the state level. A decision as to whether we have sufficient admissible evidence to bring charges depends on a variety of factors, including witness credibility. The ability to corroborate witness statements, as well as the length of time between the events described and when they are reported to law enforcement, also are among the factors considered.\u201d", "description": "The mother of Gemmel Moore, one of Ed Buck\u2019s alleged victims, is relieved her son may finally see justice in light of federal charges against Buck distributing methamphetamine resulting in her son\u2019s death on July 27, 2017.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
