The release follows a tumultuous year in which the 42-year-old became arguably the most unpopular celebrity in America: he caused uproar by expressing support for US president Donald Trump; claimed slavery was a \u201cchoice\u201d; and posted a pair of tweets calling for the abolishment of the 13 Amendment. There was the continued fallout of a serious feud with Taylor Swift, and the ongoing scrutiny of the Kardashian family including his wife, Kim, and the problematic messages they promote. And all of this took place amid West\u2019s grappling with a bipolar disorder diagnosis and consequent treatment.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Not because he was a born-again Christian (if anything this newfound zeal for religion is just another problem for his non-Christian fans), but because of the sincerity with which he approached the project.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s been an ever-present theme for years, most famously on 2004\u2019s \u201cJesus Walks\u201d, which was praised for bringing the subject of faith into hip hop. Artists still speak with reverence of its impact today; an episode of the docu-series Hip-Hop: The Songs that Shook America showed John Legend commenting: \u201cKanye made it OK to talk about your faith in songs again.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the theme became more complex and muddied thanks to West\u2019s battle between ego and artistry. The death of his mother Donda of surgery complications in 2007 had a profound effect on him; 808s and Heartbreak followed, featuring a despondent West who had clearly lost his way. But then he declared himself a god on Yeezus; his inner demons were fought via the story of Paul the Apostle on The Life of Pablo before, finally, he asked God to shine a light and save him on 2018\u2019s KIDS SEE GHOSTS.\n\nAnd so to Jesus is King. The album, a mere 27 minutes and four seconds, opens with West\u2019s Sunday Service Choir and bright, sharp piano notes \u2013 an uplifting sound that speaks of new beginnings. The tone becomes more serious as it segues into the first full track of the album, \u201cSelah\u201d, where \u2013 for all his talk about finding God \u2013 West can\u2019t help but compare himself to Noah before the flood (\u201ceverybody judge\u201d). \u201cEverybody wanted Yandhi/ Then Jesus Christ did the laundry,\u201d he raps, suggesting the content of 2018\u2019s abandoned record was not compatible with his newfound beliefs.\n\n\u201cFollow God\u201d is one of just two or three genuinely good, or brilliant, songs on this record. There\u2019s a cool, funk-inflected groove of an R&B sample and some of West\u2019s sharpest bars delivered in a strangely deadpan style. It\u2019s combative \u2013 \u201cNow you wanna see a freak\u201d \u2013 seemingly referring to the media circus around his erratic behaviour in 2018. But then you reach \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d, a stream-of-consciousness style refrains loaded with biblical terminology. It reminds you of the preachers on street corners shouting at passers-by that they\u2019re going to hell \u2013 you feel uncomfortable and vaguely embarrassed on their behalf.\n\n\u201cOn God\u201d is another rare standout that references West\u2019s controversial 13th Amendment comments and the Grammys\u2019 latency at recognising black artists. The best features come later on the record: New Jersey native Ant Clemons, who appeared on Kanye\u2019s track \u201cAll Mine\u201d from Ye, is on \u201cEverything We Need\u201d with rapper TY Dolla $ign; his gentle, Bon Iver-esque tones are the perfect match for West\u2019s sharp delivery. Kenny G has a vibrant sax solo on \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d, one of the few tracks that really hark back to West\u2019s older sounds (in this case the heady menace of \u201cPOWER\u201d from 2010\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy).\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, but still no less disappointing, that with all of West\u2019s last-minute meddling of the album\u2019s mixes the record lacks cohesion. Jesus is King feels more like a collection of well-produced skits than a full studio album, and fans will no doubt be wondering whether all the hype and stress that preceded its unveiling was worth it. \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbour, not divide,\u201d West raps on \u201cOn God\u201d. But on this album and as an artist, divide is all he seems to be doing.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time,\u201d Kanye West announced in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a question anymore.\u201d The Chicago rapper and producer is far from shy when it comes to hailing his own talents, but given the quality of his long-awaited and oft-delayed new album, Jesus is King, this seems like a reach.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/22/gettyimages-1144225029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
