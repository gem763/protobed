First responders will be among those honored in pregame ceremonies.\n\nPlayers, managers, coaches and umpires will wear caps that have a side patch of a \u201cWe Shall Not Forget\u201d silhouette, which will also be displayed on bases and lineup cards.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays will wear caps that salute Canada and the United States.\n\nMASH MARK\n\nBig league hitters are poised to set the single-season home run record following another day with lots of long balls.\n\nThe mark of 6,105 homers was set in 2017. There have been 6,084 so far this season - there were 57 more Tuesday, with Kris Bryant, Matt Olson, George Springer, Didi Gregorius and Corey Seager among several hitters who homered twice during the day.\n\nTOUGH BREAK\n\nNL MVP Christian Yelich travels back to Milwaukee for further tests, a day after breaking his right kneecap when he fouled a ball off himself.\n\nThe Brewers said the star outfielder is done for the regular season. They didn\u2019t say whether Yelich might be able to return for the playoffs that begin Oct. 1 if they make it that far.\n\nMilwaukee has won five in a row going into its game at Miami and is chasing the Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nYelich hit .329 with 44 home runs and 97 RBIs along with 30 stolen bases this season. The outfielder was leading the majors in slugging percentage and OPS.\n\nTrent Grisham will get additional playing time in Yelich\u2019s absence. The rookie got five hits Monday and delivered a key double Tuesday night in a 4-3 win over the Marlins.\n\nCOASTIN\u2019\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers can get back to work once the visitors\u2019 clubhouse at Camden Yards is cleaned from all the bubbly they sprayed.\n\nThe Dodgers clinched their seventh straight NL West title Tuesday night, becoming the first team to seal a playoff spot this year with a 7-3 win in Baltimore.\n\nLos Angeles, coming off consecutive World Series losses to Houston and Boston and seeking its first title since 1988, will likely begin the postseason at Dodger Stadium on Oct. 3 against the NL wild-card team.\n\nIn the meantime, Ross Stripling (4-4, 3.42 ERA) makes a spot start for the Dodgers, facing Orioles lefty John Means (10-10, 3.50).\n\nNOW WHAT?\n\nNo telling what\u2019s in store at Minute Maid Park after a pair of crazy games between the Athletics and Astros.\n\nMatt Olson and Sean Murphy both homered twice as Oakland piled up 25 hits to rout Houston 21-7 on Tuesday night. That came a day after the Astros hit seven home runs in pounding the A\u2019s 15-0.\n\nAnd on Sunday, the AL West-leading Astros wrecked the Mariners 21-1. Houston became the first team in the majors to score at least 20 runs in a game and allow at least 20 in a different game in a three-game span since the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in 1894, according to STATS.\n\nNext up, A\u2019s lefty Brett Anderson (11-9, 4.19 ERA) pitches against Houston, which hasn\u2019t announced a starter.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/indians_angels_baseball_21840_c0-188-4493-2807_s1770x1032.jpg?0a21a52cef25df6d45ff61f0e5af784c70681f54", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
