The full indictment will be unsealed at his hearing on October 31.\n\n'The new accuser is just one more splinter that comes out of the woodwork when a celebrity is criminally charged, but none of the splinters will form a plank leading to his conviction because he has not committed any crime,' the attorney told Page Six on Tuesday.\n\nLast week prosecutors announced that there were 12 more accusers lined up with claims of sexual harassment by Gooding Jr dating back to 2001.\n\nHe has not been charged in those cases but the accusers are hoping to testify at his trial, prosecutors said.\n\nGooding Jr, who was already facing four misdemeanor charges for allegations from two other women, will be arraigned in the third case next week.

A club promoter who was with him urged him to leave but he pushed the promoter out of the way, Ashford alleged.\n\nThe accuser said Gooding Jr went to a Tao manager and tried to excuse his conduct as innocent.\n\nGooding Jr has staunchly denied all allegations of misconduct.\n\nNatasha Ashworth claims Gooding Jr groped her while she served him at Tao, a trendy nightclub, restaurant and bar in Manhattan (pictured), in October 2018\n\nHe was arrested in June after the first accuser, a 29-year-old woman who has not been named, phoned police claiming that he grabbed her breast while he was drunk at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar in Manhattan.\n\nShe alleged that Gooding Jr groped her in front of his girlfriend, Claudine De Niro, and that he also felt her leg.\n\nHe has always denied it, saying that she tried to come on to him and called the police when he rejected her.\n\nHis attorneys previously alleged in court documents that the original accuser approached him and his girlfriend when they were sitting at a table in the club and that he asked her to leave them alone.\n\nThey also alleged that police were called to the scene that night and after reviewing 45 minutes of footage, found nothing incriminating.\n\nHowever prosecutors decided to push ahead with the case afterwards.\n\nSurveillance footage of the incident, in which the actor is seen stroking the alleged victim's thigh and then reaching over towards her chest, is likely to be submitted into evidence.\n\nGooding Jr was arrested in June after the first accuser, a 29-year-old woman who has not been named, phoned police claiming that he grabbed her breast while he was drunk at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar in Manhattan.
