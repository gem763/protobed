(AP) \u2014 Storms with heavy rains doused the drought-parched South on Friday, prompting alerts for floods and tornadoes as two new tropical storms formed offshore, including one in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Olga, located in the Gulf of Mexico south of Louisiana, would contribute to rainfall that could total 10 inches (25 centimeters) in spots by Sunday. Neither it nor Pablo, far out in the Atlantic, was expected to reach hurricane strength.\n\nThe National Weather Service said a cold front moving into the South would collide with Olga to produce rain and possibly worse through much of the weekend.\n\nThe powerful storm spun off tornados in southwestern Alabama.\n\nA \"large and dangerous\" tornado was reported on the ground in Mobile County, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries. WKRG reported viewers sent in video of what appeared to be a large tornado on the ground and a home that appeared to be damaged.\n\nParts of coastal Louisiana could receive as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain Friday and Saturday, forecasters said, and 4 inches (10 centimeters) was possible across a wide section of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nStreets were flooding around New Orleans and metro Birmingham, where about 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) of rain fell Friday morning, and more rain was on the way.\n\nWith scores of high school football games already rescheduled because of the weather, the University of Alabama canceled its homecoming pep rally, bonfire and parade because of the forecast.\n\nRainfall totals up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) were possible from east Texas to Georgia and as far north as Kentucky, the service said. Hurricane forecasters said there was a slight chance of flash flooding from the Texas-Louisiana line into northeastern Alabama.\n\nOlga had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph) and was centered about 260 miles (418 kilometers) south of Lake Charles, Louisiana on Friday afternoon. It was moving north-northeast at 18 mph (29 kph). The storm was expected to be a depression over Michigan by Sunday morning.\n\nOfficials said Pablo was a small storm that was moving east-southeast about 325 miles (525 kilometers) west-southwest of the Azores.\n\nNo coastal tropical cyclone watches or warnings were in effect.", "description": "Storms with heavy rains doused the drought-parched South on Friday, prompting alerts for floods and tornadoes as two new tropical storms formed offshore, including one in the Gulf of Mexico.
