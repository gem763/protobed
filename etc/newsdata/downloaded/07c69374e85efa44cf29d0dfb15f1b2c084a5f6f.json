So we all still have a long way to go,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile O\u2019Leary acknowledged that there is no quick fix when it comes to addressing the gender imbalance at home, she said that Netmums\u2019 research was a \u201csignificant first step\u201d and called on employers to allow mothers and fathers the freedom to parent equally.\n\n\u201cInitiatives like shared parental leave are providing a framework for people to co-parent in a way that we\u2019ve never been able to before, but we need to make sure the world of work plays ball and doesn\u2019t penalise parents for time taken,\u201d O\u2019Leary. Said.\n\n\u201cAnd we still need to win the unequal pay battle, which still means most families can\u2019t afford for a dad to take as much time off as a mum.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary added that more visible and varied examples of family life could also help after the Netmums survey found an overwhelming majority of parents (77 per cent) said they did not feel adequately represented in the media. This was particularly true of non-white families, or those where parents were not married.\n\nDespite the need for more progress, O\u2019Leary highlighted that the findings show both mothers and fathers are championing parenting as a role that should be shared with 67 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women agreeing that parenting responsibilities shouldn\u2019t be split on gender lines.\n\n\u201cThis is something to be celebrated,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\n\u201cI very much doubt those numbers would have been achieved had we asked the same question 20 years ago. It\u2019s a great sign of how far gender equality has come as a whole.\n\n\u201cBut as we all know, we\u2019ll never achieve true gender equality until we parent equally, and with twice as many men thinking we\u2019ve already got there, as women, we\u2019ve still got a way to go before the reality of day to day life catches up with our ideals.\u201d", "description": "There is a significant difference in men and women's perception of who does the majority of domestic labour in opposite-sex couples with children, according to a new survey.
