With former Samford quarterback and undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges set to make his NFL debut this weekend for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kaepernick\u2019s agents were frustrated enough to put out a Q&A compilation on Thursday titled, \u201cFacts to Address the False Narratives Regarding Colin Kaepernick\u201d.\n\nThe release includes nine questions and statistics that Kaepernick and his camp believe have been used for more than three years to spread misinformation about him, and his continued quest to land an NFL job. Within the list are answers to the only two questions that matter most at this stage:\n\n\n\n\u201cHas Colin been offered a job by an NFL team?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHas Colin ever had a workout with an NFL team?\u201d\n\nColin Kaepernick's last game in the NFL was on New Year's Day in 2017. (AP)\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe answer to those is no.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nOf course, the reality that Kaepernick hasn\u2019t been offered a job or workout with an NFL team has been reported thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of times. But Kaepernick\u2019s camp apparently continues to see \u201cmany\u201d of these reports as misrepresentations, leading his agents to opt for a one-stop shopping list to clarify these \u201cfalse narratives\u201d in one fell swoop.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat it comes days before the Steelers are starting Hodges this weekend may be a coincidence, but it\u2019s undeniable that Kaepernick has been frustrated by the conveyor belt of backup quarterbacks who have started in the NFL since he last played in 2016. Meanwhile, his attempts to remind everyone that he wants to play in the NFL have become more aggressive in recent months, with Kaepernick posting multiple videos of himself working out with other NFL players. Included in the workout videos has been a clock counting the number of days Kaepernick has been out of the league, along with a proclamation that he\u2019s \u201cstill ready.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow he\u2019s apparently ready and going to great lengths to dispel narratives that he believes are hovering overhead.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "It\u2019s undeniable that Kaepernick has been frustrated by the conveyor belt of backup QBs who have started in the NFL since the 2017 season.", "authors": ["Charles Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hBD7o8CaQIodCfc63gb7gw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuNzQ3MjUyNzQ3MjUyOA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rn_o0RkXEUUeH5sOCKnfCg--~B/aD00ODU7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-10/ed031ad0-d39d-11e8-96f7-e6d63be5ec68", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
