He said: 'To the untrained eye you wouldn't pick up on this at all'.\n\nWhen he sent the link in a word document to This is Money, we were greeted by an antivirus page warning us of a 'deceptive site ahead' which 'may trick you into doing something dangerous'.\n\nEbay has continued to deny to our reader that any security issue took place, while Currys PC World has no evidence this was the case.\n\nOne reader also told us the scammers had set up a phishing link to harvest personal details from those purchasing the items on eBay. The auction site and Currys PC World both deny this, but a link sent to us from our reader immediately draws an anti-virus warning\n\nAccording to publicly available eBay listings, 14 iPhone 11 Pro Max phones were sold and 140 of the regular iPhone 11 phones were, before the products were listed as 'sold out'.\n\nThe scam appeared to take place over the weekend of 19 October with the PayPal address changed back to normal on Monday morning.\n\nOur reader told us he thought the fraudster had banked on there not being anyone monitoring the eBay listings from Currys PC World at that time.\n\n14 iPhone 11 Pro Max phones were paid for during the scam, netting the fraudster \u00a316,899\n\nAccording to the listing, 13 of the Pro Max phones sold for \u00a31,200 and one sold for \u00a31,499, while 75 iPhone 11 phones were sold for \u00a3650 and 25 for \u00a3720.\n\nWhile eBay only publicly shows the last 100 sold items on a listing, even estimating the remaining 40 phones sold for the lower price means \u00a3111,174 was stolen by the hacker over the course of just over two days on those two listings alone.\n\nHowever, with Currys PC World confirming to This is Money 'approximately 600 orders' were affected, it is likely the amount customers lost could be four times this amount - or nearly half a million pounds.\n\nPayments for 140 regular iPhone 11 phones were also siphoned off. This is Money worked out the 154 orders together amounted to at least \u00a3111,174, with Currys PC World informing us 4 times that many orders were affected in total\n\nIt said in a statement to This is Money: 'The Currys PC World eBay store is hosted by eBay with payments processed by PayPal.\n\n'Over the weekend, the eBay store temporarily experienced issues affecting approximately 600 orders from our customers. This has now been resolved.\n\n'We are very disappointed that this has happened and we're working with eBay to investigate what has taken place.\n\n'While we don't host this website, we are providing affected customers with guidance on how to obtain a refund from PayPal.'\n\nIt also all but confirmed the scam to our reader in an email sent on 26 October, in which it said: 'Due to reasons outside our control, we have not received the payment from PayPal for your order and are unable to fulfil this.'\n\nHowever, anyone seeking redress over the weekend the scam occurred found themselves out of luck.\n\nOur reader showed us an email sent by PayPal in the early hours of Sunday morning, in which it denied his claim for a refund as 'this transaction was not unauthorised.'\n\nCustomers initially had claims for compensation denied by PayPal\n\nMeanwhile, in a live chat on the same day, an eBay customer service representative said: 'the payment has gone safely to the seller', and 'your transaction is definitely legitimate, there is nothing to worry about.'\n\nOnly on the Wednesday, four days after our reader had unwittingly sent \u00a31,200 to a scammer and after he had contacted Currys PC World, did he receive a message on eBay which stated: 'Unfortunately this order was incorrectly processed and so PayPal are organising refunds.\n\n'We have spoken with PayPal \u2013 they have said they are currently working to reverse any affected transactions and these funds should be in your account over the coming days.'\n\nHowever, both eBay and PayPal have now changed tack and told those affected that after the order was 'incorrectly processed' refunds would be issued. Neither informed victims in the immediate aftermath of the scam\n\nAnother person on the same online forum our reader saw the link to the deal wrote on Thursday 24 October: 'I've had no contact from eBay, PayPal or Currys to date so this came as a bit of a shock.\n\n'You would think that when they suspect that fraudulent activity has occurred they would want to warn the affected parties.'\n\nEbay told This is Money in a statement: 'The issue was resolved quickly and customers can continue to shop with full confidence.\n\n'We are working closely with Currys PC World on an investigation into the matter.'\n\nOur reader has not yet received a refund, though has received a \u00a350 Currys PC World voucher.\n\nIn an email sent to him by PayPal on Thursday 24 October, it said it was requesting additional information from the person behind the PayPal account the money was sent to following the switch on the listings.\n\nPayPal told This is Money: 'We are aware of this incident and are currently working to reverse any affected transactions. These funds should be in customers' accounts over the coming days.\n\n'If a customer has not seen their money refunded then they may need to raise an 'item not received' case via their PayPal account.'", "description": "Currys PC World has become the latest to be hit by a wave of online eBay scams, with the electricals retailer potentially losing \u00a3500,000 in little over two days, This is Money can exclusively reveal.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
