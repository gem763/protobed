(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post)\n\nThis week\u2019s recommendations feature two beauties from a French winery that is rapidly climbing my list of favorites. Christian Collovray and Jean-Luc Terrier are based in the Macon region of Burgundy, but La Closerie des Lys is their property in the mountains of the southwest, near Limoux. I\u2019ve raved about their chardonnay under the Antugnac label. Their pinot noir is a stunning value at $17. You can compare its light, delicate approach with a heartier Oregon style from Boedecker for less than the price of many pinots.\n\nAnd because Halloween is coming, we have two wines with scary labels \u2014 but don\u2019t be frightened, the wines are as delicious as full-size candy bars.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLa Closerie des Lys Les Fruiti\u00e8res Blanc 2017\n\nPays d'Oc, France, $12\n\nHere\u2019s an unusually serious wine for $12. It has notes of citrus and white flowers, anchored by a strong mineral core that reflects the wine\u2019s mountain origin in the Haute Vallee de l\u2019Aude near Limoux. The blend is chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and vermentino. Alcohol by volume: 13 percent.\n\nImported by Vintage \u201959, distributed by Winebow: Available in the District at Rodman\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Beer, Wine & Co. and Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda; Downtown Crown Wine and Beer in Gaithersburg.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLa Closerie des Lys Pinot Noir 2017\n\nPays d'Oc, France, $17\n\nWow, here\u2019s a delicious pinot noir that seems to defy gravity: Its color, body and flavors leave an impression of weightlessness. There\u2019s no obvious power to this wine, yet its essence reverberates like an echo in the mountains. Absolutely delightful. ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported by Vintage \u201959, distributed by Winebow: Available in the District at Rodman\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Beer, Wine & Co. and Bradley Food & Beverage in Bethesda; Friendship Gourmet Market in Chevy Chase. Available in Virginia at Oakton Wine Shop in Oakton.\n\nBodegas Tobia Daimon Tinto 2017\n\nRioja, Spain, $15\n\nSpicy and energetic, with a sense of flirting with danger, this is a lively red wine bursting with flavors of dark fruits and wild herbs and \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 a haunting finish. It\u2019s a blend of garnacha and tempranillo. Don\u2019t try to keep this spirit bottled up, and don\u2019t limit it to October \u2014 it\u2019s year-round delicious. ABV: 14 percent.\n\nImported by Tri-Vin, distributed by DMV: Available in the District at Modern Liquors, Paul\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Rodman\u2019s.

It features lively flavors of black cherry, mushroom and root beer spice, with a long finish that will leave you wanting more. ABV: 13.5 percent.\n\nDistributed by Elite: Available in the District at Daily 14 Mart, Modern Liquors, Rodman\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Wine Cellars of Annapolis. Available in Virginia at Balducci\u2019s in Reston, Locke Store in Millwood, Wine Guild in Charlottesville.\n\nVinyes Ocults Malbec 2016\n\nValle de Uco, Mendoza, Argentina, $20\n\nThis malbec is not as scary as its label might suggest, but it does display a nervous tension, the kind of energy that makes a wine lively and tasty. Enjoy this with burgers, steaks, chops \u2014 any kind of meats, really. ABV: 13.8 percent.\n\nImported by Tri-Vin, distributed by DMV: Available in the District at Paul\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Riggs Liquors, Rodman\u2019s, Yes! Organic Market (Georgia Avenue).
