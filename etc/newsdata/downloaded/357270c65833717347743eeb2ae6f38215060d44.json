After his team\u2019s scheduled match against France was cancelled by Rugby World Cup officials over typhoon safety fears, Jones said his team would benefit from a two-week break in comparison to the Wallabies, who were pushed hard by rugged Georgia on Friday.\n\nCheika said all his former teammate at Sydney club Randwick had done was heap pressure onto himself.\n\nEngland cancellation has cost me a weekend in Japan and the World Cup its surprise factor Read more\n\n\u201cWell, I saw he was saying that that (cancellation) would be an advantage and the \u2019typhoon gods\u2019 were smiling on him,\u201d Cheika said \u201cThey\u2019ve had the best preparation according to the coach so they\u2019d better go out there and win.
