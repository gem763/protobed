But it was the regional bank CEO who was most dreading the work involved in another inquiry.\n\nIndeed, he suggested that these inquiries actually hurt competition in and of themselves, given the bigger banks could more easily absorb the cost and distraction required to formulate appropriate responses.\n\nThe second point \u2013 that regulators should be more worried about the quality of competition than the number of competitors \u2013 is more nuanced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSims told a parliamentary committee last week that \u201ceven though you've got some quite big players outside the big four, it's not clear that any of them are really displacing any of the big four or making serious inroads''.\n\nBut the view from within the banks is very different.\n\nOur big four chief says the mortgage market \u2013 which is now really the only prize as the big four simplify themselves \u2013 is currently ultra-competitive and the majors are giving ground.\n\nThe statistics from the year to June 30 show that while the big four\u2019s market share is still dominant at 75.1 per cent, this has retreated from 76.2 per cent.\n\nThis share has been mainly taken by the so-called challenger banks \u2013 led by Macquarie Bank, Members Equity Bank, AMP Bank and three foreign challengers \u2013 ING, HSBC and Citigroup \u2013 which have had their overall share rise by 70 basis points to 8.7 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the non-bank sector\u2019s market share has risen to 6.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent.\n\nPerhaps more interesting is the momentum enjoyed by some of these challengers versus the big four.\n\nAs of June 30, the majors were increasing their mortgage books at 0.57 times the growth of the entire banking system, well down from 0.81 times a year earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the challengers are growing at 3.4 times the system, up from 2.06 times a year earlier. The non-banks are also growing at 2.85 times, up from 2.33.\n\nThere are some fascinating moves among the challenger cohort. For example, HSBC is growing at 12.16 times system, up from 4.75 times at June 30, 2018. And Macquarie is growing at 3.62 times, up from 2.51.\n\nObviously, these challengers\u2019 loan books remain tiny compared with the big four. And Sims is right that it\u2019s far too early to claim that any of them are making \u201cserious inroads\u201d into the market position of the big four, particularly given their huge customer bases.\n\nBut it does appear that the fight for new loans is intense \u2013 and that\u2019s before any neobanks really get going, and big tech giants such as Apple and Amazon make the market forays that everyone expects over the longer term.\n\nOur regional bank chief would also like to finally see some movement on the changes to capital rules that would call for regional banks to hold much higher levels of capital against their home loans than the big ones.\n\nThese changes were recommended by the Murray inquiry and rubber-stamped by the productivity inquiry, but there\u2019s been little movement.\n\nWhile the regional banks do concede their size does require them to hold more capital than the big banks, seeing this gap closed is much more important to them than yet another inquiry that might not hand down its findings until 2021.", "description": "The threat of yet another competition inquiry has big and small banks singing from the same hymn sheet as challenger banks gain momentum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_68/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dcb79f59d8b00bfc267b3a24b34bb49d9b22adfb", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
