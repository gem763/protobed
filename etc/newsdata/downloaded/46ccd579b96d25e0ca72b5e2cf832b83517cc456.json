It has leverage to \u201cgreen transition\u201d in oilfield operations, he said.\n\n\u201cWith energy producers, regulators and investors increasingly demanding environmentally responsible practices we believe demand for combustion systems is poised for structural growth,\u201d Monachello said in a Sept. 27 report. AltaCorp initiated coverage on the company last week with an outperform rating and a share price target of $5.50 (US$4.16). The shares closed at $4.27 on Tuesday.\n\nAs people seek to incorporate socially responsible investment options into their portfolios, a company like Questor stands out. And that positive investor sentiment can be seen in the company\u2019s shares, which have surpassed the broader Canadian energy index this year \u2014 its stock has gained 28 per cent, more than tripling the S&P/TSX Energy Index\u2019s 8 per cent climb.\n\nCanaccord Genuity\u2019s John Bereznicki added to the bullish tone in a report published Monday and said, \u201cThe company is enjoying strong secular growth drivers amidst increasingly stringent oilfield emissions standards and an emerging industry focus on waste methane.\u201d He\u2019s reiterating a buy recommendation and $6 price target.\n\nAll four analysts covering the $116-million market cap company have a buy-equivalent rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBut competition is steep, as certain business lines overlap with some notable names. One of its largest and most notable private competitors is John Zink Hamworthy Combustion, a unit of Koch Industries Inc., while publicly traded competitors include National Oilwell Varco Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd., AltaCorp\u2019s Monachello added.\n\nThe company plans to monitor data on air pollution from its emissions control centre in Calgary, while generating the majority of its revenue in the U.S. Questor obtained 92 per cent of its sales in 2018 from the U.S., and 8 per cent in Canada, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\u201cThe North Dakota market and our initial entry into Texas, Wyoming and New Mexico are the drivers for our increased rental revenues,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Audrey Mascarenhas said in the second-quarter earnings release in August. She holds about 16 per cent of Questor\u2019s shares outstanding.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Questor Technology has gained 28 per cent this year", "authors": ["Michael Bellusci", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/questor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
