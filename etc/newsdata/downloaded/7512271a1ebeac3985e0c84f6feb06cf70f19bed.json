Thousands of foreign tourists fill the city's streets daily, many staying in local hotels while others visit as part of day trips from nearby Osaka.\n\nGion, with its narrow alleys and picturesque teahouses, is a particularly popular area and home to many of Japan 's geishas.\n\nAccording to Japanese public broadcaster NHK , Gion's local resident group has voted to ban photography in the community's private streets and homes. Anyone caught flouting the law will be fined \u00a510,000 ($92).\n\nJapanese geisha and their apprentices walk in the street during an annual new year's ceremony at the Gion Kobu Kaburenjo Theater on January 7, 2016.

It was accompanied by a list of activities tourists could be fined for, including smoking in public and bicycling while drunk.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nAnd while Kyoto's popularity issues have been going on for some time, it's not the only Japanese city dealing with some of the unintended side effects of welcoming international guests.\n\nThe city of Kamakura, best known for its giant Buddha, posted signs last year asking travelers not to eat while walking\n\nWhile some of that stemmed from concern around littering, it also related to Japanese culture, where it's considered disrespectful to eat while doing a physical activity.", "description": "Kyoto's historic Gion neighborhood is banning photography in certain areas in response to ongoing issues with bad tourist behavior.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191028101020-geisha-kyoto-file-photo-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
