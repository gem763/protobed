Sign up here.\n\nThe Trump administration dealt a fresh blow to renewable energy developers on Friday by stripping away an exemption the industry was counting on to weather the president\u2019s tariffs on imported panels.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative said Friday it was eliminating a loophole granted about four months ago for bifacial solar panels, which generate electricity on both sides. They\u2019ll now be subject to the duties Trump announced on imported equipment in early 2018, currently at 25%. The change takes effect Oct. 28.\n\nThe exclusion had been a reprieve for the solar industry, which lost thousands of jobs and put projects on ice as a result of the tariffs. Some panel manufacturers had already begun shifting supply chains to produce more bifacial panels. Stripping the exemption represents a setback to developers building big U.S. solar projects. American panel makers First Solar Inc. and SunPower Corp. will meanwhile regain an edge on foreign competitors.\n\n\u201cThe solar tariffs are back,\u201d Tara Narayanan, an analyst at BloombergNEF, said in an interview Friday. \u201cU.S. solar developers cannot buy products with lower costs and higher output as they briefly thought they could.\u201d\n\nFirst Solar, the largest U.S. solar panel maker, and SunPower both gained in after-markets trading late Friday.\n\nWhat BloombergNEF Says\n\n\u201cThe withdraw of tariff exemption for bifacial will cool down its popularity in the U.S. a little, but not stop the rise of the technology, which introduces improved economics even without tariff exemption.\u201d-- Xiaoting Wang, solar analyst\n\nDevelopers that have used bifacial panels and stand to take a hit from ending the exclusion include Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc. and Swinerton Inc.\n\nWhile bifacial panels accounted for just 3% of the solar market last year, BloombergNEF had projected a swift ramp-up in production as manufacturers tried to insulate themselves from U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe trade group Solar Energy Industries Association fought to preserve the exemption, saying bifacial technology held \u201cgreat promise for creating jobs, right here in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed,\u201d the group\u2019s general counsel, John Smirnow, said Friday. \u201cWe look forward to making sure the bifacial exemption gets a fair hearing\u201d during the solar tariff\u2019s mid-term review process, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative said in its filing that the exclusion would\u2019ve probably resulted in \u201csignificant increases in imports of bifacial solar panels\u201d that would\u2019ve rivaled domestically produced ones.\n\nSunPower, based in San Jose, California, opposed the exemption without a cap, saying that it would otherwise defeat the purpose of the tariffs. \u201cIt just means everyone is going to make a bifacial,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Tom Werner, said in a Sept. 23 interview.\n\n--With assistance from Joe Ryan.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Brian Eckhouse in New York at beckhouse@bloomberg.net;Christopher Martin in New York at cmartin11@bloomberg.net;Ari Natter in Washington at anatter5@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Joe Ryan, Pratish Narayanan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The Trump administration dealt a fresh blow to renewable energy developers on Friday by stripping away an exemption the industry was counting on to weather the president\u2019s tariffs on imported", "authors": ["Brian Eckhouse", "Christopher Martin", "Ari Natter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ai37JymSEdkrKVf4fa8VWQ--~B/aD04NDY7dz0xNDgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e36b3274b521deafab126e0a31740ad6", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
