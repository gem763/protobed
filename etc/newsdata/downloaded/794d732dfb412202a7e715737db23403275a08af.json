The NBA has established a training camp in the same province as the concentration camps.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver attempted to walk back condemnation of Morey following outrage from Americans shocked that an American sports league would censor free political speech, particularly one that has spent years fostering political debate among its athletes and stars. The Chinese regime is still forcing streaming companies to cancel NBA game broadcasts in response to the controversy.\n\nIn an article published Monday titled \u201cGlobal Brands Better Stay Away from Politics,\u201d the Global Times warned Americans, and international actors, that Chinese authoritarian speech restrictions now apply worldwide and any protests in the name of free speech are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, general manager of the NBA team the Houston Rockets, has obviously gotten himself into trouble,\u201d the article lamented, calling Morey\u2019s skill at his job \u201csimply too poor\u201d for challenging an authoritarian regime.\n\n\u201cCommercial and cultural organizations which engage in transnational operations should manage their attitudes and statements over sensitive issues. Impulsive words can easily trigger a backlash,\u201d the newspaper advised. \u201cRespecting customers is a universal business rule. Morey has to choose between safeguarding his individual freedom of speech and protecting the Rockets\u2019 commercial interests by respecting the feelings of Chinese fans. When he opted for the former, the Rockets will have to make a second choice from the perspective of the team.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times called Americans \u201cridiculous\u201d for defending freedom of speech, especially targeting 2020 Democratic candidate Andrew Yang for criticizing China.\n\n\u201cMorey does have the freedom to praise Hong Kong protesters, just like the Chinese fans also have the freedom to abandon the Rockets,\u201d the Times claimed. \u201cThe problem is that Morey\u2019s freedom is at the expense of Rockets\u2019 huge commercial interests, which the team is unwilling to give up.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper went on to insist that the controversy \u201chas nothing to do with the Chinese government\u201d \u2013 even though the Chinese government controls all aspects of the country\u2019s relationship with the NBA and heavily regulates speech, meaning Chinese \u201cfans\u201d say only what the government legally allows them to. The Global Times then dared accuse the United States of using \u201cideological pressure\u201d against the Houston Rockets to keep them from surrendering to China.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities that value commercial interests must make their members speak cautiously,\u201d the article concluded. \u201cChinese consumers are not overly sensitive. Wherever it is, touching a raw political nerve is extremely risky.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times did not always oppose corporations getting into politics. Last year, it applauded the athletics company Nike for hiring communist former football player Colin Kaepernick as a spokesperson on the heels of his remarks about race in America, which echo the Communist Party\u2019s criticisms of the United States.\n\n\u201cCompanies often shy away from politics, but in the commoditized sneaker trade, it\u2019s a risk worth taking,\u201d the Global Times claimed then, predicting, \u201cthere will be more like Nike.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, painted Morey as a victim of \u201cthe constant barrage of western reports\u201d that have \u201cglorified\u201d the Hong Kong protest movement.\n\n\u201cFor many Americans, the western methods are the best solution for state governance, while the Chinese system, totally different from its western counterparts, is deemed as a rebel against orthodoxy,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily claimed. \u201cSuch biased reports can satisfy many readers, while those who impartially speak for China will be tagged as \u2018pro-communism\u2019 types.\u201d The People\u2019s Daily also highlighted the NBA\u2019s craven profit-driven agenda \u2013 not as the reason for forcing Morey to apologize for defending democracy, but for the backlash against them:\n\nWestern hypocrisy is also a contributing factor. Leaders in the sports, business as well as financial industries and more that side with Morey are all profit-driven. Though always talking about democracy and freedom, it is the financial benefits that they are really craving for. They would do anything to become rich, let it be lies, blackmails, or bullying. There are those American entrepreneurs who have earned a great fortune in China yet still stand with the US politicians in the trade war against China, they are good examples.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry is attempting to take a back seat to the nation\u2019s propaganda outlets and armies of online belligerents.\n\n\u201cI suggest they pay attention to the reaction of the ordinary Chinese people,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Monday, referring to the NBA. Geng did warn China would \u201cfirm and powerful measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nThe NBA initially appeared to stand firmly with the repressive communist regime against its own employee.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d the league said in a statement. \u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Adam Silver attempted to walk back the statement following near-universal condemnation in America, however, calling the NBA a \u201cvalues-based organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear \u2026 that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said. He did not specify who exactly Morey is supported by, exactly.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The Chinese government newspaper\u00a0Global Times warned \"global brands\" to \"make their members speak cautiously\" on Chinese political issues.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/chairman-mao-soldier-china-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
