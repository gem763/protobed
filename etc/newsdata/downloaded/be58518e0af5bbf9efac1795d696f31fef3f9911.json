(He also co-created the T-Mobile Sidekick, aka Danger Hiptop, many years ago.)\n\nNew UI for radically different formfactor pic.twitter.com/Es8hFrTuxx \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) October 8, 2019\n\nThe photos appear to show an elongated phone with a very, very tall UI composed of card-like apps, but with big buttons that look like they\u2019d be perfectly at home on a smartwatch. It look extremely small in his hands, too. The device has a large button and volume rocker on the right edge and a fingerprint divot around back, below what appears to be a single main camera.\n\nAnd as you can see, these devices have some decidedly flashy finishes that change color when you view them at different angles \u2014 a sea green that shifts to yellow and blue, for example.\n\nGEM Colorshift material pic.twitter.com/QJStoiDleH \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) October 8, 2019\n\nAn Essential spokesperson confirmed to the The Verge that this is the company\u2019s new phone, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on a new device that\u2019s now in early testing with our team outside the lab. We look forward to sharing more in the near future.\u201d\n\n\u201cnow in early testing with our team outside the lab\u201d\n\nThe original Essential Phone was known for its flashy design, including a sea green color with gold accents known as Ocean Depths. And in late 2018, Bloomberg reported that Essential was working on a phone with a smaller screen that\u2019d be controlled mostly through voice commands, with an AI assistant automatically performing tasks for you. In December, Essential all but confirmed it was working on a second phone.\n\nIf some leaked code snippets spotted by XDA-Developers and an Essential trademark application pan out, \u201cGEM\u201d might actually be the name of the new phone, and it may activate its voice assistant when you tap your finger to that divot around back \u2014 the code snippets mention a \u201cfingerprint walkie talkie\u201d mode. They also suggest it runs Android and point at a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 processor, whose midrange performance might make sense for a device that\u2019s designed more as a mobile companion than becoming the digital center of your life.\n\nWhile we wait for more info, perhaps you\u2019d like to know more about that robot dog that\u2019s lurking in the background of Rubin\u2019s snapshots? That\u2019s the Boston Dynamics Spot \u2014 from a company that Andy Rubin helped Google temporarily purchase back in 2013, by the way \u2014 and we\u2019ve got an awesome video about Spot that you can watch below.", "description": "A new device tweeted by Andy Rubin looks like no phone we\u2019ve ever seen before, with a super tall UI, a smartwatch-like interface and extremely flashy colors.
