Free cash flow jumped 74 per cent in the first half of 2019 to $US638 million.\n\nIn August, Santos reduced its estimate for the oil price at which it will break even this year to about $US31 a barrel, in line with last year, despite higher capital investment in 2019. For every $US10 that the oil price is above that, Santos's annual free cash flow rises by $US300 million-$US350 million.", "description": "Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher is accelerating a growth phase now, after heavy cost-cutting in the early days of his tenure which started in 2016.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3668%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_318%2C$y_250/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/71a452a91fc0b4e8247a7ab0c3ee3a181de97bb3", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
