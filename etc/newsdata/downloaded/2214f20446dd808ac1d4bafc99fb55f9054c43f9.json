The people who comprise the Hollywood ATM for Democrat candidates want Biden to get aggressive and hit back.\n\nMaybe Biden thought it would show the Hollywood bigwigs that he\u2019s a tough guy and can take the heat from Trump if he broadened his criticisms and included Rudy Guiliani. He told supporters at a fundraiser that Rudy\u2019s \u201ca thug\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s a thug, Giuliani. No, he\u2019s a thug. I know him,\u201d Biden told about 100 people gathered at the Brentwood home of Paramount\u2019s Jim Gianopulos and his wife, Ann. According to a pool report, Biden continued, \u201cAnd the president is the most dishonorable president in American history. And folks, he picked the wrong guy to pick a fight with, because I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019m going to beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nBiden did some fundraising in Los Angeles Thursday after delivering an attack against Trump Wednesday in New Hampshire. It was the first time good old Joe spoke out forcefully in response to Trump\u2019s remarks about Biden and his son, Hunter The Biden donors would like more, please.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t make-or-break time for the Vice President, but it is time to start hitting Trump harder,\u201d said one top industry donor of Biden\u2019s responses to him, his family and his campaign. \u201cCalling for impeachment was one thing, but Biden needs to stop coasting and get out in front of this,\u201d the A-lister added.\n\nHollywood executives held two fundraisers Thursday \u2013 one in the afternoon and one in the evening \u2013 and they are looking for more than Biden repeating over and over again that he will \u201cbeat Trump like a drum\u201d. Polls show Elizabeth Warren rising and she\u2019s overtaken his lead in both Iowa and New Hampshire, at least today as I write this, according to RCP. The two are bouncing back and forth, though Biden has managed to keep his support relatively steady even without maintaining an aggressive campaign schedule.\n\nBiden has essentially been phoning it in and looking as though he is feeling as entitled as Hillary Clinton was in 2016. His campaign has been caught flat-footed in defense against the charges of Biden family corruption in Ukraine and China, too. It is puzzling why Team Biden wasn\u2019t prepared and ready to respond when all of this first began. Coming out Wednesday as he did with a bunch of name-calling and macho talk of beating Trump like a drum wasn\u2019t very convincing. Donors are wondering if Biden\u2019s up to the task of a tough general election campaign.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that they think Biden should do a 60 Minutes-style sitdown to go point-by-point through the Ukraine-Hunter Biden connection, as some believe that would be giving implicit credibility to Trump\u2019s attacks. However, there is a sense that Biden has a unique opportunity to break through, particularly at a time when the Massachusetts senator is drawing so much attention for her rise in the polls and fundraising.\n\nBiden still has strong support in Los Angeles but some are starting to speak up. Elizabeth Warren is an alternative but not necessarily the top choice if Biden fades. Show biz is a business, after all, and most of the show business execs are not quite ready for socialism.\n\nMeanwhile, Warren, who has shunned the type of tony, high-dollar fundraising events that are a staple of Hollywood\u2019s political scene, has a number of fans in showbiz. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an uptick in interest,\u201d Bojarsky said, adding that \u201cpeople have started to talking about how she can broaden her appeal.\u201d Right now, a number of Biden\u2019s industry supporters still feel Sen. Warren will prove too far to the left to win a general election, even as she leads the ex-VP among Dems in some polls. And even in an industry that leans heavily to the left in theory, attacks on the rich have their limits for some upper crust donors, what with Warren\u2019s proposal for a wealth tax and vows to overhaul other aspects of American capitalism.\n\nBiden will have to up his game if he wants to hold on to the money in Los Angeles. The question remains, is he up to the task? Time will tell if he\u2019s \u201cgoing anywhere\u201d or not.", "description": "Words", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joe-Biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
