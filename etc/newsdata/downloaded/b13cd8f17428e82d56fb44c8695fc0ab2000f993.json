The complaint also claimed that the envoy connected Giuliani with Ukrainian officials.\n\nSources familiar with the nine-and-a-half hour interview before the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees told Fox News it was a \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d interview.\n\nVolker did not think Victor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Ukrainian firm Burisma -- on which Hunter Biden held a board seat -- was reliable when he told Giuliani that he was told to back off of the investigation at then-Vice President Joe Biden's behest, which is why he worried what Giuliani might try to do with Shokin's claims, according to sources familiar with the testimony.\n\nText messages obtained by Fox News showed Volker and other U.S. officials battling internally over whether Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine as he pressed the country to look into the Biden family, reportedly using $400 million in military aid as leverage during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to induce him to have officials investigate the Bidens.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL INTERVIEW WITH TRUMP'S EX-UKRAINE ENVOY BLOWS HOLE IN DEMOCRATS' 'QUID PRO QUO' CLAIMS, GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\n\nReps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Thursday\u2019s interview with Volker \u201cundercut\u201d the Democratic narrative that Trump tried to interfere with an election.\n\nHouse Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry into Trump, prompted by the whistleblower complaint, after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., made a formal request on Sept. 10 to transmit the complaint to Congress.\n\n\u201cThe facts we learned today undercut the salacious narrative that Adam Schiff is using to sell his impeachment ambitions,\u201d Jordan and Nunes said in a joint statement. \u201cWe hope the American people get to read the transcript of today's testimony and see the truth.\"\n\nRep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., was also present at the interview and asserted Thursday on Fox News' \u201cThe Story\u201d that Volker\u2019s testimony disproved the idea of a quid pro quo.\n\n\"You really couldn't have a more professional and more credible witness -- and more knowledgable about Ukraine,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI would call Ambassador Volker the star witness in the so-called whistleblower's report. Everything he said unsubstantiated this claim of a quid pro quo.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nDemocrats did not have the same takeaway from Volker's interview.\n\n\"We saw further evidence that there was a shadow shakedown going on and that the lead [...] deputy for the president was Rudy Giuliani. You had an experienced diplomat working for free -- special envoy Mr. Volker -- who, in many ways, was a front for work that was being done on the side parallel to his efforts by Rudy Giuliani,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., as NBC News reported.\n\nFox News' Martha MacCallum and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "Republican lawmakers who were present at ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker\u2019s closed-door marathon\u00a0interview before three House committees\u00a0on\u00a0Thursday seemed confident it disproved any allegations of a \"quid pro quo\"\u00a0in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, as sources told Fox News that Volker was worried about the reliability of the Ukrainian prosecutor informing Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Volker720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
