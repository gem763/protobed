The exact timing of Perry\u2019s departure from his role is not yet known.\n\nThe planned resignation comes as Perry draws scrutiny over his apparent role in President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Top House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Trump misused presidential authority by pushing the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, during a July 25 phone call.\n\nPerry played a key role in shaping the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and worked with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Guiliani, to encourage a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens, administration officials told Fox News. Trump told House Republicans that it was Perry who pushed him to hold the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The president has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAn Energy Department spokesperson said Perry \u201cabsolutely supported and encouraged\u201d Trump to take the call, but said it was related to energy and economic policy. The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees subpoenaed Perry to submit documents related to his involvement with the Ukraine call and whether he pressured Ukrainian officials to replace leadership at a state-owned energy company. Perry was told to comply with the request by Oct. 18.\n\nPerry is expected to formally step down as energy secretary by the end of the year, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe former Texas governor was one of the longest-tenured members of Trump's cabinet. At Perry's direction, the U.S. increased the production of fossil fuels.\n\nPerry denied rumors earlier this month that he planned to resign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m serving. They\u2019ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now. One of these days they'll probably get it right. But it\u2019s not today. It\u2019s not tomorrow. It\u2019s not next month,\u201d Perry said at the time, according to Politico.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The exact timing of Perry\u2019s departure from his role is not yet known.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Rick-Perry.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
