It is a shame what happened yesterday, so I cannot enjoy my first victory.\"\n\nLeclerc posted a childhood picture with his arm around Hubert upon news of his death following a horrifying 160mph crash in Saturday's Formula Two race. He accompanied the picture with the words: \"I can't believe it.\"\n\nLeclerc, who is 22 next month, the same age as Hubert, was visibly moved by the tragedy. Prior to the race, he hugged Hubert's mother, Nathalie.\n\nA moment of silence was observed before the race in the French driver's memory. Nathalie held her son's pink and white crash helmet. Hubert's brother, Victhor, stood alongside her as the Formula One and grieving Formula Two drivers formed an arc, bowing their heads in honour of their fallen colleague.\n\nDaniel Ricciardo, the usually jovial Australian, kept his eyes closed throughout the silence and ensuing national anthem. He then appeared to wipe away tears, summing up the sombre mood before the start of Sunday's race. All 20 of the drivers' cars were adorned with \"Racing for Anthoine\" stickers.\n\nLeclerc made the perfect start, racing away to the slow, right-handed La Source turn, to retain the lead. Hamilton, starting from third, got the jump on Vettel before Max Verstappen bumped wheels with Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nThe force of the impact sent Raikkonen temporarily on to two wheels. Verstappen sustained damage to his car and slammed into the barriers at the top of Eau Rouge, the corner which claimed Hubert's life.\n\nVerstappen walked away unscathed from the high-speed shunt, but the safety car was quickly deployed. Vettel had managed to re-pass Hamilton for second on the Kemmel Straight, while British teenager Lando Norris took advantage of the chaotic opening exchanges to move up six spots to fifth.\n\nFollowing the safety car period, Leclerc retained his lead, with Hamilton hot on Vettel's heels. The German stopped on lap 16, but it was not until lap 21 that Leclerc dived in for a change of rubber. Hamilton pitted on the next lap.\n\nThe early stop had helped Vettel take the lead, but his tyres would not last the course. On lap 27, he was told by Ferrari to move out of Leclerc's way, which he duly did. Then, on lap 32, Hamilton fought his way past with Vettel struggling on ageing rubber.\n\nLeclerc was six seconds up the road on Hamilton, and the world champion kept Leclerc honest to the flag, crossing the line just one second behind the Ferrari driver.\n\nBut Leclerc would hold on to take an emotional victory ahead of Hamilton, Bottas and Vettel.\n\nNorris looked set to claim a career-best fifth in his McLaren, but stopped with an apparent mechanical failure as he began his final lap.\n\nThe London-born Alex Albon took the flag in fifth after starting 18th in an impressive start to his Red Bull career.\n\nFinal Positions after Race (44 Laps)\n\n1 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1hr 23mins 45.710secs\n\n2 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 1:23:46.691\n\n3 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP 1:23:58.295\n\n4 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:24:12.132\n\n5 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 1:25:07.035\n\n6 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 1:25:10.158\n\n7 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:25:15.367\n\n8 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 1:25:32.349\n\n9 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:25:34.878\n\n10 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 1:25:35.548\n\n11 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren at 1 lap\n\n12 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 at 1 lap\n\n13 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas F1 at 1 lap\n\n14 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault at 1 lap\n\n15 George Russell (Gbr) Williams at 1 lap\n\n16 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing at 1 lap\n\n17 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams at 1 lap\n\n18 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo Racing at 2 laps\n\nNot Classified:\n\n19 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 1 lap completed\n\n20 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 0 laps completed\n\nPA", "description": "Charles Leclerc registered the maiden win of his Formula One career after romping to victory at the Belgian Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Philip Duncan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/16/charles-leclerc.jpg"}
