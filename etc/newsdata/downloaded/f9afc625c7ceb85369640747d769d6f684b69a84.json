(\u201cAsanko\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX, NYSE American: AKG) is pleased to announce production results for the third quarter (\u201cQ3\u201d) 2019 from the Asanko Gold Mine (\u201cAGM\u201d), located in Ghana, West Africa. The AGM is a 50:50 joint venture (\u201cJV\u201d) with Gold Fields Ltd (JSE, NYSE: GFI) which is managed and operated by Asanko.\n\nAGM Q3 Highlights (100% basis):\n\nRecord proceeds of $91.0 million generated from gold sales of 63,009 ounces at an average realized price of $1,443 per ounce\n\nRecord gold production of 62,440 ounces, on track to meet 2019 production guidance of 225,000 - 245,000 ounces\n\nMined 1.11 million tonnes (\u201cMt\u201d) of ore, including 0.62Mt of ore from the Esaase pit\n\nProcessed record 1.44Mt of ore with an average gold grade of 1.4 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t\u201d)\n\nContinued strong safety performance with no lost time or recordable injuries during the quarter\n\n\u201cThe Asanko Gold Mine continued to deliver strong operational performance during the quarter with record quarterly production and revenue,\u201d said Greg McCunn, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cDuring the third quarter we substantially completed the Cut 2 pushback at the Nkran pit concluding a significant capital program that allows the mine to focus on generating meaningful free cash flow. Increased free cash flow will continue to strengthen the balance sheet at both the corporate and Joint Venture level. At the corporate level, during the third quarter we received $10 million from our JV partner pursuant to the Joint Venture Transaction and we expect to receive a further $10 million on or before December 31, 2019, significantly bolstering our corporate balance sheet.\u201d\n\nHealth and Safety\n\nThere were no lost time injuries (\u201cLTI\u201d) reported during the quarter. As at September 30, 2019, the mine achieved over 30 months without an LTI. The were also no recordable injuries during the quarter.\n\nProduction\n\nIn Q3, the AGM sourced ore from the Nkran, Esaase and Dynamite Hill pits as well as ore stockpiles. At Nkran, waste mining operations substantially concluded the final stage of the western portion of the Cut 2 pushback. During the quarter, 4.71Mt of waste and 0.32Mt of ore at an average gold grade of 1.8 g/t were mined from the Nkran pit. The Esaase pit delivered 0.62Mt of ore at an average gold grade of 1.3g/t with 1.53Mt of waste mined. Dynamite Hill delivered 0.17Mt of ore at a gold grade of 0.8 g/t with 0.13Mt of waste mined.\n\nThe processing plant milled 1.44Mt at a gold grade of 1.4 g/t during the quarter with metallurgical recovery averaging 94%.\n\nPreliminary Costs\n\nPreliminary operating cost estimates for the AGM during the quarter are provided with final operating costs to be released in conjunction with the Q3 2019 Interim Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis on or about November 7, 2019. Preliminary operating cash costs per ounce1 were $799, preliminary total cash costs per ounce1 were $872, and preliminary all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce1 (or \u201cAISC\u201d) were $1,179 in Q3 2019. Although Q3 2019 AISC were higher than the 2019 annual cost guidance of $1,040 - $1,060/oz, management forecasts a reduction in AISC in Q4 2019 as waste mining on Cut 2 at Nkran was nearing completion during the quarter. During Q3, capitalized stripping costs associated with Cut 2 at Nkran amounted to $162/oz. In early Q4, capitalized stripping is expected to be complete, resulting in substantially lower AISC.\n\nAGM Key Production Statistics (100% basis) Units Q3 2019 Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018 Total Tonnes Mined 000 t 7,477 8,864 8,088 9,740 Waste Tonnes Mined 000 t 6,372 7,808 6,584 8,370 Ore Tonnes Mined 000 t 1,105 1,056 1,505 1,370 Strip Ratio W:O 5.8:1 7.4:1 4.4:1 6.1:1 Average Gold Grade Mined g/t 1.5 1.6 1.4 1.5 Ore Treated 000 t 1,439 1,375 1,224 1,238 Gold Feed Grade g/t 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.6 Gold Recovery % 94 93 93 95 Gold Produced oz 62,440 62,067 60,425 59,823\n\nSales and Liquidity\n\nGold production for the quarter totalled 62,440 ounces with gold sales of 63,009 ounces at an average realized price of US$1,443 per ounce, generating record gold sales proceeds of $91.0 million for the JV.
