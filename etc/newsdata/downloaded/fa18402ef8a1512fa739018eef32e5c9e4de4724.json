Fortunately, this wasn't the kind of incident that would afford him a Netflix True Crime original. No, his neighbours simply found his Mustang Shelby to be too loud. This brush with the law got himself and fellow Mustang engineers to thinking \u2014 there had to be a way to make the exhaust quieter in the next generation of Ponies. There was, and they called it Quiet Mode. But for Mustang fans out there who appreciate the roar of the engine jumping to life, that hasn't been stripped out. In fact, Aussies in particular wanted the 2018 Mustangs to be louder. Suffice to say, it's been a complicated journey.

No autos here.\n\nThe R-Spec was developed with the help of Herrod Motorsport in Melbourne, and also contains an active muffler and upgraded suspension.\n\nIt is reported to had an average fuel consumption of 14L/100km, which is 1L more than a regular V8 Mustang.\n\nWhen asked whether they were actually inspired by true blue Aussie Splice when it came to the colour, Ford designer Dave Dewitt told Gizmodo Australia that they wanted something that would grab people's attention. It's for this reason that it's been called 'Grabber Lime'. A 'Twisted Orange' variant is also available.\n\n\"The R-SPEC has to stand out visually, even at a standstill,\" said Dewitt in a press release.\n\n\"That starts with the stance, and the unique 19-inch Ford Performance alloy wheels combined with the Ford Performance suspension package. When we combine these functional upgrades with the unique design cues, the result is a meaner more aggressive attitude and more flattering silhouette, the car just looks ready to go!\"\n\n\"The MY2020 colour palette lends itself superbly to the black treatment, but the details go beyond this. While the alloys and side-stripes \u2013 which hark back to the previous R-SPEC offered here in 2014 \u2013 are matte finished, the off-set striping, mirror caps and the rear spoiler have been given a gloss treatment to add more visual impact to the changes.\"\n\nInspiration for the design was also drawn from the old school and equally hot Mustang Boss 302 from 1969. There was one at the launch event and sadly we did not steal it.\n\nImage: Tegan Jones/Gizmodo Australia\n\nThe 2020 Ford Mustang R-Spec is available for pre-order from today for $99,980 plus on-road costs.
