It is also seeking to reverse a sharp loss of confidence among foreign investors and depositors who are turning away from the Lebanese pound.\n\nWhile no deal was formally announced, Lebanese officials portrayed Monday's high-stakes talks as positive while Abu Dhabi stressed its support for Lebanon. In response, dollar bonds issued by heavily indebted Lebanon rose.\n\n191007125015845\n\nA Lebanese government source said Hariri would remain in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday for follow-up meetings.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed \"stressed during the meeting that the UAE ... is keen on supporting its relationships with Lebanon on different levels, and stands by it in all that preserves its security and stability,\" the state news agency WAM reported.\n\nWhen asked earlier on Monday whether Lebanon would receive an injection of cash into its central bank from the UAE, Hariri said: \"We are working on everything ... Yes, we are hoping, we will work on it.\"\n\nThe bank has been drawing down its foreign exchange reserves to repay the state's maturing dollar-denominated debt, and said last week it was prepared to do more.\n\nCentral bank Governor Riad Salameh, also attending the conference, said it was continuing to provide dollars to local financial markets. He added that Lebanon has \"numerous possibilities\" as it looks for assistance, but it anticipates support from the UAE.", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has said he is hoping the UAE will inject cash into Lebanon's central bank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/df75bc20cbd449f18ddb22f85cd00199_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
