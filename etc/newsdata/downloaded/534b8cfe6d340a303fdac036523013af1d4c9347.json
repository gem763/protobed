The fine handed out indicates how serious the court took his offending.\n\n'Using this equipment in this way puts other innocent, law-abiding road users at risk by people who believe that they can travel at speed with complete immunity from prosecution.\n\n'As the result today shows, this will not be tolerated and North Yorkshire Police will ensure offenders are investigated and brought to justice.\n\n'My advice to those who have these devices fitted to their vehicles and believe they're untouchable is to remove them immediately. As we've seen today, if you pervert the course of justice you'll face far worse than a speeding fine.'\n\nAs well as a fine and suspended sentence Faulkner was ordered to pay \u00a3800 costs to the prosecution and \u00a3140 victim surcharge, bringing the total to \u00a35,940.", "description": "Grant Robert Faulkner, 54, rigged his car with a 'laser jammer' (circled) to stop speed guns taking an accurate reading.
