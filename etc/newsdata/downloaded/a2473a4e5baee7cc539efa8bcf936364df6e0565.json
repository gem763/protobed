Get on the bus...That's the bank's message to customers who must travel TEN MILES", "language": "en", "text": "Communities across the country are reeling over Barclays' cynical pledge to stop closing branches when it has already ruthlessly left many without a bank.\n\nThis is against the backdrop of its controversial announcement earlier this month that it will stop letting its customers withdraw cash via Post Office branches from January.\n\nAmong those who feel betrayed is the population of Buntingford in Hertfordshire.\n\nWhat a cheek: A poster taped on the window of the closed bank advertises a subsidised minibus service to Royston, taking over two hours\n\nLet down: Among those who feel betrayed is the population of Buntingford in Hertfordshire\n\nThe market town has enjoyed a high street renaissance in the past three years with millions of pounds invested in new properties \u2013 and the population doubling to 10,000.\n\nYet Barclays pulled the plug as the last bank in town this May \u2013 even though 500 inhabitants signed a petition pleading for it to remain.\n\nA poster slapped on the front door of the closed branch states: 'Visit any post office to do your banking essentials.'\n\nFrom the message, you might think customers had not been abandoned but could still get help with their essential banking \u2013 but Barclays is being disingenuous.\n\nFrom January 8 next year, its customers will no longer be able to withdraw cash from the town's post office \u2013 situated inside McColl's convenience store \u2013 because the bank no longer wants to pay an arrangement fee of just under \u00a31 per transaction.\n\nFamily butcher Barry Phipps says: 'This is a despicable way to treat us \u2013 kicking a community when it is down. We were promised that when the bank closed, the post office would still be there to serve. This has turned out to be nothing but a lie.'\n\nTo rub salt in the wound, there is another poster taped on the front window of the closed bank. It is promoting a new subsidised local minibus service to Royston \u2013 ten miles away \u2013 leaving at 10.40am every Monday and dropping people off at its Barclays branch before coming back at 1pm.\n\nThe return journey costs \u00a32 \u2013 and takes two hours and 20 minutes \u2013 just to pay in a cheque.\n\nOutrage: Communities across the country are reeling over Barclays' cynical pledge to stop closing branches when it has already ruthlessly left many without a bank\n\nRetired engineer Ray Jones is close to tears in a local coffee shop. The 80-year-old suffers from the early stages of vascular dementia and had his driving licence taken away from him two weeks ago. He now has to catch this bus to visit the bank.\n\nThe Barclays customer says: 'I am petrified about what the future might bring. For me the bank reneged on a promise as it said the post office would still be there for all our needs \u2013 knowing full well when it said this that this was simply not the truth.'\n\nThe widower, who once worked on RAF Vulcan jet bombers, is fearful of what might happen if the bus service also gets pulled.\n\nA couple of years ago he was swindled out of \u00a311,000 after unwittingly giving crooks his bank details in a cruel banking scam \u2013 he understandably does not use the internet for banking but wants to deal with people.\n\nBarclays has said it will provide a 'cashback' service using 200 local businesses to serve its customers \u2013 but critics see this as a smokescreen because there are 11,500 post office outlets handling 1.2 million Barclays withdrawals a month.\n\nThe bank will still use the post office for customer deposits.\n\nThe bank pledged not to close 'the last bank in town' for at least 100 communities in the next two years. Communities such as those in Buntingford fear the promise means nothing. Either it has already wielded the axe or is pausing for breath before a 2021 cull.\n\nBarclays business customer Lucy Evan, who was out walking with her cocker spaniel Jack, believes the writing was already on the wall a couple of years ago when the bank shifted to part-time opening hours \u2013 meaning you never really knew when it was open and you queued longer to be served.\n\nPoor show: Customers with Barclays will not be able to withdraw cash from Post Office branches for January next year\n\nThe 51-year-old project manager says: 'I am also miffed it took its ATM away when it closed \u2013 we now only have one nearby at a Sainsbury's.\n\n'I understand banks need to make a profit but they seem to forget that people still want to deal in cash. Not everyone likes being forced to use the internet.'\n\nA third of all high street banks have closed since 2015 \u2013 culled at the rate of 55 a month. Now there are only about 9,000 banks left.\n\nOver the past couple of years Barclays has closed 243 branches, according to research by consumer group Which?.\n\nIt has only been beaten by RBS in its level of ruthlessness, the latter axing 277 since the start of 2018.\n\nBarclays now has fewer than 1,000 branches. Lloyds has about 1,100; NatWest and Santander both have about 800 outlets; HSBC less than 700. Since the start of last year, NatWest has shut at least 197 branches; Santander 173; and Lloyds 109.\n\nAt least 25 million people in Britain \u2013 half the adult population \u2013 rely on cash for their day-to-day needs, according to the Access to Cash Review published by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney earlier this year.\n\nShe says: 'We need to support the cash system \u2013 not undermine it. Barclays is dealing a double blow by closing branches and hurting post offices.'\n\nDerek French, founder of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, says: 'Barclays is talking rot claiming it wants to serve the community and then refusing to let customers take money out from a post office.'\n\nAdam Rowse, managing director of branch banking at Barclays, says: 'We are exploring new ways to support and work with communities. We aim to help branches survive with new initiatives \u2013 including more flexible hours and video link help.'", "description": "Barclays pulled the plug as the last bank in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, this May - even though 500 inhabitants signed a petition pleading for it to remain.", "authors": ["Towalne For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
