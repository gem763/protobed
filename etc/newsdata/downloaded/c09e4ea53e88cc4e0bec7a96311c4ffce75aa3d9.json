They\u2019re very smart in that way.\u201d\n\nWeggen lives in central Sweden and has won several awards for his wildlife photography.\n\n(Geert Weggen/SWNS) More\n\nTalking about how he captures his images of the animals, Weggen explained it often requires a great deal of patience.\n\n(SWNS/Geert Weggen) More\n\n\u201cI cannot tame a wild squirrel. They do exactly what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cI can wait a very long time for my shot.\u201d\n\n(Geert Weggen/SWNS) More\n\nOccasionally, it helps to entice the squirrels with food.\n\n\u201cI know they\u2019re always searching for food, so I might hang a little bucket with seeds in the air. If I want them to pick up a pencil, I spread a little peanut butter on it.\u201d", "description": "An award-winning photographer has captured a group of squirrels playing with pumpkins ahead of Halloween.The images, taken by wildlife photographer Geert Weggen, show the red squirrels poking their heads inside carved pumpkins.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0ZR1pmRMAaQIUutj9vU_tA--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/882046af7e6e2fe0ecf434dd150b1b72", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
