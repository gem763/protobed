Seth Rich, a 27-year-old staffer for the Democratic National Committee, was killed in Washington, D.C., on July 10, 2016.\n\nAn appeals court on Friday reinstated a lawsuit from the parents of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich against Fox News, who exploited Rich\u2019s 2016 murder and promulgated right-wing conspiracy theories about it.\n\nRich\u2019s parents, Joel and Mary Rich, sued the network after it published unverified claims in 2017 that linked Rich to Democratic National Committee emails leaked by WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages for the \u201cemotional distress\u201d caused by the right-wing fixation on their son\u2019s death.\n\nA lower-court judge threw out the lawsuit last year, saying that the suit\u2019s claims were not \u201csufficiently outrageous\u201d and \u201cfail to adequately allege essential elements of the causes of action asserted.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday, a panel of federal appeals court judges in New York said the judge erred in dismissing the suit.\n\n\u201cThe Riches\u2019 complaint plausibly alleges enough facts to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress \u2014 for extreme and outrageous conduct by [Fox News],\u201d the judges wrote in their ruling. \u201cWe have no trouble concluding that \u2014 taking their allegations as true \u2014 the Riches plausibly alleged what amounted to a campaign of emotional torture.\u201d\n\nIn July 2016, Rich, 27, was shot and killed near his home in Washington. Police determined that his murder, which remains unsolved, was from a botched robbery. There has been no credible evidence that his death was linked to the leaked DNC emails.\n\nA week after publishing its thinly sourced story in May 2017, Fox News retracted it, saying it \u201cwas not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny.\u201d But by then, it had received high-profile coverage from network hosts like Sean Hannity and Steve Doocy, who heavily pushed the story on-air.\n\n\u201cNo parent should ever have to live through what we have been forced to endure,\u201d Rich\u2019s parents said in a statement when they filed the original lawsuit last year. \u201cThe pain and anguish that comes from seeing your murdered son\u2019s life and legacy treated as a mere political football is beyond comprehension.\u201d\n\nFox News responded to the lawsuit\u2019s revival in a statement Friday:\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling today permits Mr. and Mrs. Rich to proceed with discovery to determine whether there is a factual basis for their claims against FOX News. And while we extend the Rich family our deepest condolences for their loss, we believe that discovery will demonstrate that FOX News did not engage in conduct that will support the Riches\u2019 claims. We will be evaluating our next legal steps.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Fox News.", "description": "The network exploited the Democratic National Committee staffer's murder and spread false conspiracy theories.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7baa10240000c92b797016.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
