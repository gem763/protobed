Windows blinded - no daylight.\n\n\"No separate shower cabin - only bath top with restricted access. Dirt marks on carpets. Floor in restaurant all over greasy. Nowhere you had the feeling this is a clean hotel.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\n\"The guy in reception tried to explain without acknowledging he facts. Why didn\u2019t complain on arrival? Because I arrived around 11 pm. I will not even consider to go back.\"\n\nBastien Peyraud, the general manager, decided to respond to the complaint in brilliant fashion.\n\nHe said: \"Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel as you promised to our Front Office Manager when he refused to refund your stay.\n\n\"You arrived at 11pm and left at 8am, it is the reason why you didn't have much day light in your room despite the 2 large windows, it is common in Ireland during night time.\n\n\"These windows are not blinded but frosted to protect your privacy of our guest in this room as we are based in the heart of Cork City.\n\n\"You have booked a Classic Twin room online with a bathtub, so it is exactly what we have allocated to you. Our front office manager didn't invite you to complain on arrival but we could have change your room allocation if a walking shower was a requirement for you and available. But for that we needed you to mentioned it to us.\n\n\"My team and myself are really sorry that you decided not to come back to our hotel, and I have amended your guest profile to make sure you do not book our hotel ever again by mistake.\"", "description": "The reviewer, a tourist from Denmark, said the blinds at the Imperial Hotel in Cork City, Ireland, did not allow any daylight in their room - but they didn't arrive until after dark and left early", "authors": ["Cormac O'Shea", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734556.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/56553717_10156256234147081_3434918593400143872_n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
