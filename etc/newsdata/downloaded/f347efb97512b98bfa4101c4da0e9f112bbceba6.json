I felt inadequate like when I felt people heard the record they would hear my awkward voice, my poor warbly voice,\" Phair said. \"It mystified me. I'd walk around going like, 'what is this magic trick?'\"\n\nShe'd perform it again with hits like \"Why Can't I?\" But Phair has had long periods when she's slipped in and out of rock stardom. Surprisingly though, Phair said she's long been uncomfortable being the star.\n\n\n\n\"A little bit. I ham it up. You know how you overcompensate when you're uncomfortable about something \u2026 but I am like a bookish nerdish introvert who just doesn't want to be invisible or irrelevant,\" she said.\n\nSaturday Sessions: Liz Phair performs \"Why Can't I?\"\n\nThe bookish singer has now written her own book, \"Horror Stories,\" a magically lyrical memoir that is also searingly honest. \"My conscience,\" she writes, \"is a fantastic prosecutor.\"\n\n\"What was the hardest part to write about?\" Mason asked.\n\n\"Probably the affair I had at the end of my marriage. Or the #MeToo chapter about the sexual harassment that I've experienced in my life,\" she said.\n\nIn \"Horror Stories,\" Phair writes that the president of a record label showed her pornographic picture books in his office. In another story, a different label head tells her \"to let radio programmers feel me up a little, because it would be good for my career.\" She writes that a third label exec offered her $5,000 a month \"to be his live-in mistress.\"\n\n\"I had never added all that [up]. I had never even in therapy. I had never even talked about it to anyone,\" she said. \"I hated that chapter \u2026 I don't like to see myself as a victim. I mean I'm almost kind of tearing up right now, because I don't like to feel like a victim \u2026 I feel sorry for that girl. That I was. I wish I could go back and help her out or hold her hand or yell at someone for her.\"\n\nSaturday Sessions: Liz Phair performs \"Divorce Song\"\n\nPhair said writing the memoir as a sort of \"magic trick\": \"If you write it all down. It goes into that page and some part of it leaves you. Not all of it. But like it's a relief.\"\n\nPhair also describes a painful breakup about a decade ago, with a longtime boyfriend who has a baby with another woman.\n\n\"It changed the trajectory of my life. That breakup destroyed my ability to trust myself,\" she said. \"And so I pulled out of dating and I just kind of became paralyzed I guess.\"\n\nIn the aftermath, Phair focused on raising her son, Nick.\n\n\"Then when I wanted to get back into music after he went to college, I didn't know who I was. I didn't know who this Liz Phair was \u2026 she seemed way cooler than I was. And way tougher,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPhair said she found herself again by playing live music: \"If you pull it off, you feel like a living god. You're just like invincible. It's fabulous.\"\n\nPhair's new album is expected to come out early next year.", "description": "In her new memoir she describes what it was like to be a young female musician in a male-dominated industry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/20f3742f-e05f-4f22-9e16-e5521cdb5e8c/thumbnail/1200x630/48f8815e168c75c5f16b40409bfe10ef/1012-satmo-lizphair-setup-webextra-1950648-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
