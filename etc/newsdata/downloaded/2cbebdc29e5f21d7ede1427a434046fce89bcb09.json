Pictured: Samantha, left, with a friend\n\nMany of the cannabis vaping products contained high levels of vitamin E acetate, which is linked to the illnesses, including Samantha's.\n\n'They found lots of vapes in her room when the police officers looked in there,' Hatten-Ford told Fox 10.\n\n'[There is] nicotine in the oils and doctors mentioned that, if they were off-market, vitamin E oils they are very dangerous when heated up.'\n\nSamantha has since been extubated, meaning her breathing tube has been removed, and was able to communicate with doctors herself for the first time on Monday.\n\nHer mother says she hopes her daughter and her friends will now recognize the dangers of vaping.\n\n'I'm thinking that maybe seeing her this way might wake [her friends] up and that it can happen,' Hatten-Ford said,referring to life-threatening lung damage linked to vaping.\n\nFox 10 reported that Samantha will remain at Phoenix Children's Hospital for at least the next five weeks.", "description": "Samantha Ford, 16, from Phoenix, Arizona, went into cardiac arrest last Tuesday after secretly vaping for two years.
