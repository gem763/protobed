What he lacks in stature he more than makes up for in physical courage, notably in the tackle area.\n\nA livewire around the base of the scrum and in open play, he also made one try assist and scored one of his own, deservedly picking up the man-of-the-match award for a fine individual performance.\n\n\u2013 Mapimpi wins battle of wingers \u2013\n\nThe match had been touted as a duel between South Africa\u2019s pocket-rocket Cheslin Kolbe and the Japanese duo of Kotaro Matsushima and Kenki Fukuoka.\n\nBut it was the relatively unheralded second Bok winger, Makazole Mapimpi, who shone in Tokyo.\n\nHe scored a beauty of an opening try, taking a de Klerk pass from the scrum and easily shrugging off a woeful Yu Tamura tackle and fending off Ryohei Yamanaka to crash in at the corner.\n\nHe followed that up by shaking off the feeble defensive attentions of Matsushima for a well-taken second late in the game to settle Springbok nerves. Statistics showed that Mapimpi made more metres going forward than both Matsushima and Fukuoka combined.\n\n\u2013 Should the \u2018Beast\u2019 have seen red? \u2013\n\nJapan coach Jamie Joseph said he had seen red cards as often brandished as yellows for tip tackles like the one South Africa\u2019s Tendai Mtawarira committed on rival prop Keita Inagaki.\n\nAs it was, the Zimbabwe-born front-rower was only shown a yellow card by English referee Wayne Barnes, who didn\u2019t even consult the television match official before making his decision.\n\nA red would have been a major turning point in the match.\n\n\u2013 de Allende centre of attention \u2013\n\nWhile de Klerk picked up the award for the game\u2019s outstanding performer, there was another star turn for the Springboks in the shape of Damian de Allende.\n\nThe centre was in barn-storming form, the Boks\u2019 go-to ball carrier, with a leading nine takes, and equally aggressive in defence, with 14 tackles.\n\nHe was also unlucky to have what would have been a great, scrambling try ruled out, Barnes saying he had been held on the ground as he surged over the line.\n\n\u2013 Wales, prepare for the maul \u2013\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s blitz defence nullified Japan\u2019s plan to make use of their pacy outside backs, but the second period in particular saw them turn the screw at the set-piece, successfully competing for Japanese ball at the line-out and winning a number of scrum penalties.\n\nBut where the gnarly forwards, based around the brutish figures of Duane Vermeulen, Eben Etzebeth and Lood de Jager, really stood out was in the driving maul.\n\nIt has been a proven weapon in the Springbok armoury for many a season and there is no doubt Wales will see more of its seething mass come the semi-final in Yokohama.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 South Africa progressed into a World Cup semi-final against Wales after a 26-3 victory over Japan on Sunday.
