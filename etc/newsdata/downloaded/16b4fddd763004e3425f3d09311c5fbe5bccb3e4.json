The diplomat said it was in the \"U.S.' interest for the information that was reaching the president to be accurate and fresh and coming from the right people.\"\n\nSondland and Giuliani worked with Andriy Yermak, a senior aide to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Volker testified. Giuliani remarked that the statement would need to include a reference to alleged 2016 election interference involving Ukraine and the Biden-linked Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, according to Volker, or else \"it\u2019s not credible, because what are they hiding?\u201d\n\nSONDLAND TO TESTIFY TRUMP TOLD HIM -- 'NO QUID PRO QUO'\n\n\"I then discussed that with Mr. Yermak after that conversation, and he did not want to include Burisma and 2016, and I agreed with him,\" Volker told House investigators, per the sources. Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma Holdings while his father handled Ukraine policy as vice president.\n\nThe draft statement was never released. Volker insisted in his testimony that he \"was never asked to do anything that I thought was wrong,\" the sources said.\n\nSeparately, in a contentious exchange with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Volker said he believed Ukrainians did not know that the U.S. had suspended military aid to the country until a month after the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. During that call, Trump asked if Ukraine could \"look into\" Joe Biden's actions involving the country.\n\nDemocrats have alleged that Trump held up the aid as part of a quid pro quo to kickstart a probe into the Bidens, which Trump has denied. Volker said the Ukrainians were not immediately aware the aid was suspended, and shortly after the call secured a meeting with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nWHY DID PELOSI ANNOUNCE DEMS WON'T VOTE ON BEGINNING AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY?\n\n\"In that context, I think the Ukrainians felt like things are going the right direction, and they had not done anything... on a [Biden] investigation,\" Volker was said to have testified.\n\nWhen Democrats pressed Volker on why Hunter Biden was invited to serve on the board of Burisma Holdings, Volker said he suspected Burisma was concerned about its reputation for corruption and was looking to \"spruce up its image\" by having \"prominent-named people on the board.\"\n\nSondland's planned testimony comes amid back-to-back witnesses in the Democrats' impeachment probe. On Wednesday, Michael McKinley, a career foreign service officer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff, reportedly told investigators behind closed doors that he could no longer look the other way amid the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, which were among the reasons he ended his 37-year career last week.\n\nAmong McKinley\u2019s concerns, according to reports: the administration\u2019s failure to support then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in March on orders from Trump.\n\nMcKinley, who as a Latin America expert was not specifically involved in Ukraine, also was said to have been frustrated that there had been no response to an August inspector general\u2019s report that found significant evidence of leadership and management problems, including allegations from career employees that Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley and his former senior adviser Mari Stull retaliated or tried to retaliate against them as holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters outside the closed-door hearing that McKinley was complimentary about Pompeo\u2019s role but did raise other issues.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard,\" Meadows said, declining to provide more details from the closed session.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, tweeted on the eve of Sondland's testimony late Wednesday that the House should vote to \"censure\" Schiff.", "description": "As\u00a0U.S. envoy to the European Union Gordon\u00a0Sondland prepares to testify Thursday in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, sources with first-hand knowledge confirmed to Fox News that former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker testified that he consulted with Sondland on a draft statement that was to be issued by\u00a0Ukrainian president\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
