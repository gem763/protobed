Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Ocasio-Cortez grills Zuckerberg over political ad policy MORE\u2019s (D-Mass.) Accountable Capitalism Act would oblige large corporations to obtain a federal charter requiring directors to consider the interests of all stakeholders \u2014 not only shareholders and customers, but also groups representing society as a whole, such as their employees, local communities and civil society, including non-representative, anti-business NGOs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe chief justice of the supreme court of Delaware \u2013 where more than two-thirds of Fortune 500 corporations have their legal home \u2013 has written a book arguing that corporations should be run for the benefit of their workers. The Financial Times has launched a \u201cnew agenda\u201d campaign that intones: \u201cCapitalism. Time for a reset. Business must make a profit but should serve a purpose too.\u201d\n\nNone of this would have come as a surprise to Joseph Schumpeter, one of the 20th century\u2019s great economists. No one understood better the dynamic, propulsive nature of capitalism. But, unlike most economists, Schumpeter also had a deep, subtle appreciation of capitalism\u2019s cultural effects \u2014 that, while a system of free enterprise creates successful and prosperous societies, it also plants seeds that can lead to its own demise. \u201cUnlike any other type of society,\u201d Schumpeter wrote \u201ccapitalism inevitably and by virtue of the very logic of its civilization creates, educates and subsidizes a vested interest in social unrest.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Schumpeter saw it, the publicly traded corporation, lacking the visceral allegiance of private property, was capitalism\u2019s weak point: \u201cDefenseless fortresses invite aggression especially if there is rich booty in them.\u201d It\u2019s a prophecy that we\u2019re seeing come to pass.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecently, in a letter to the Business Roundtable,181 corporate CEOs disavowed the profit motive and corporate directors\u2019 accountability to shareholders. The CEOs championed a view now widely held: that profit could only be justified for virtuous conduct, that profit should merely be a byproduct of making certain contributions to society. It\u2019s a position that the Business Roundtable already implicitly accepts.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely wrong. In fact, the profit that a business earns is a pretty good approximation of its contribution to society. One might think of it in terms of a simple equation:\n\nRevenue (what people will pay in a competitive market) minus cost (the value of resources used to provide a product or service) equals profit (a first-order indicator of a business\u2019s contribution to society).\n\nProfit is one of the most powerful signaling devices in a free market. In their search for profit, businesses create the dynamic for economic growth \u2014 and rising living standards. Is this not a contribution to society, of the most dramatic kind imaginable?\n\nThe point is beautifully made in Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen\u2019s \u201cThe Prosperity Paradox.\u201d Christensen writes of poor, developing nations: \u201cIt may sound counter-intuitive, but enduring prosperity for many countries will not come from fixing poverty. By investing in market-creating innovations, investors and entrepreneurs inadvertently engage in nation-building.\u201d Entrepreneurs and businesses don\u2019t have to set out to improve the world \u2014 through their collective efforts of making useful goods and services, an improved world is the outcome.\n\nYet today, the publicly traded corporation is perhaps under greater threat than at any time since the 1930s. Corporations are blamed for the world\u2019s ills: inequality and stagnant income growth, poverty in poor countries, environmental degradation and, of course, climate change. Using business as tools to tackle these problems highlights a deep confusion about the proper domains of democratic politics and of business. Last year, voters rejected climate initiatives in Arizona, Colorado and, for a second time, Washington State. Failing at politics, activists seek to politicize business \u2014 which, so the argument goes, must be accountable to vast networks of \u201cstakeholders.\u201d\n\nAmerican advocates of \u201cstakeholder accountability\u201d miss the implications of their proposals. Shareholders \u2013 whatever their nationality \u2013 share the same interest in a business\u2019s economic success. In contrast, stakeholders, by definition hugely diverse, have correspondingly diverse and conflicting interests. America has more multinational corporations than any other nation. Around 45 percent of Amazon\u2019s workforce is outside America; 61 percent of Exxon Mobil\u2019s $234 billion operating capital is located outside the United States. Suppose the European Union passes its version of Sen. Warren\u2019s legislation, requiring that American multinationals be held accountable to European stakeholders. Forget trade wars: We could soon have wars over corporate control.\n\nAlready, Warren has written to ten CEOs demanding they back her Accountable Capitalism Act. \u201cCommitments are hollow if they are not accompanied by tangible action that provides real benefits to workers and other stakeholders,\u201d she told them.\n\nOne of the primary grounds on which those \u201creal benefits\u201d will be evaluated is environmental practices. Though environmentalism has its roots in a wholesale rejection of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism, business leaders have a long history of subscribing to its core tenets \u2014 including the premise that resource-fueled economic growth is unsustainable. Robert Anderson, chairman of Atlantic Richfield, helped finance the first Earth Day in 1970 and provided the seed funding for Friends of the Earth, which is no friend of capitalism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Aspen Institute, which Anderson also chaired, ran programs on the threat of climate change and the steps needed to avoid a planetary catastrophe. A two-day workshop in 1970 concluded that business-as-usual threatened the future of a decent, civilized world. \u201cAll insist,\u201d the New York Times reported, \u201cthat the human family is approaching a historic crisis which will require fundamental revisions in the organization of society.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? The world managed to survive that purported ecological emergency by ignoring it. We would be well served to ignore the similarly pitched appeals being made now. Otherwise, the attempt to solve global warming by intimidating American corporations could bring about Schumpeter\u2019s grim prognosis of capitalism\u2019s downfall.\n\nRupert Darwall is the author of \u201cGreen Tyranny: Exposing he Totalitarian Roots of the Climate Industrial Complex\u201d (2017) and \u201cThe Age of Global Warming: A History\u201d (2013).
