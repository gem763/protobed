It was the hardest pregnancy I had because I was hyper aware that I was already big, and my doctor told me that I shouldn't gain too much weight with him.\n\n'I developed high blood pressure while I was pregnant and had a few scares. I was also very uncomfortable and had a lot of back and hip pain' she added.\n\nShe hit rock bottom when Chase, then aged three, started to mock her and call her fat.

I also had to prove that I could lose some weight before my surgery, which I did!

With Logan, I was induced three weeks early because of my blood pressure. 'I knew people were looking at me, thinking \"woah, she's big\", and I'd try to ignore it but couldn't..

That was my rock bottom' she said.\n\n'I was angry and emotional. Of course, he had no idea the impact it had on me as he was only three. I remember locking myself in the bathroom and crying. Asking myself how I was going to fix the problem.\n\n'Over the years I've tried various diets, including shakes, fasting, low carb and keto. I lost most of my weight after surgery and through working out'\n\nWhat is the Keto diet and how does it work? The Keto diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat plan, and is quite similar to the Atkins diet. Those on it are required to cut the amount of calories they consume by a significant amount, while eating plenty of fatty foods like fish, meat and eggs. Some people on the diet also drink 'bulletproof coffee' - black coffee with ghee (clarified butter), which helps to stop them from getting hungry during the day. The diet works by effectively starving the body of carbohydrates - the main source of stored energy. When this happens, the body burns fat for energy instead. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain. Ketogenic diets can cause massive reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels - helping to reverse Type 2 diabetes.\n\n'Within a month I joined the gym and I started doing the bike and the cross-trainer. I remember only being able to do 10 minutes when I first started, but I was proud of myself for being the big girl at the gym and I wasn't ashamed to be in the gym anymore.\n\n'Over the years I've tried various diets, including shakes, fasting, low carb and keto. I lost most of my weight after surgery and through working out.\n\n'For a good few years I was stuck around 168lbs and knew I had to try something else. So, in October 2018 I started a low carb lifestyle mixed with protein shakes.\n\n'In January 2019 I started the keto lifestyle. I spent some time researching and following accounts and decided to give it a try.\n\n'That's when I made my @lowcarb.godess Instagram account and started documenting my journey.\n\n'Through keto I learned that it's about maintaining a lifestyle rather than constantly shedding, so I switched to macro counting, which is what I'm currently doing and I feel amazing.\n\n'My friends and family are so proud of me and I'm so thankful for their support.\n\n'It's given me a real drive to keep going and to show people that you can do anything you put your mind to.\n\n'I'm a mother -of-three so I'm constantly running around after my sons, I work full time and still manage to track my food, eat homemade meals and work out every day. Anyone who sees that I can do it can know that they can too.'", "description": "Schauna Harshman, 35,\u00a0 from North Dakota,  decided to have a gastric band fitted after her son Chase, then three, mocked her for being fat, and she's since lost 138lbs.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20367864-0-image-a-50_1572429526492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
