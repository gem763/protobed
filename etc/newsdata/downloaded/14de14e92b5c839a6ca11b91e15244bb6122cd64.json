REUTERS/Jumana El Heloueh\n\nWhile World Rugby\u2019s Regulation 9 dictates players must be released by clubs for internationals, it is not always cut and dried for professionals from outside the top tier of nations.\n\nTuatagaloa\u2019s contract at his French club of the previous three years, Valence Romans, had expired and they wanted a commitment for the entire season, from August to May.\n\nThe winger led the try-scoring standings to help the club to promotion to the second tier of French rugby but playing at the Sept 20-Nov 2 World Cup would mean missing a fair chunk of the campaign.\n\n\u201cThey did not specifically say \u2018you stay and get a contract or you choose\u2019. That was not said,\u201d Tuatagaloa told Reuters.\n\n\u201cI think the coach wanted me to stay and play, but if I made the World Cup then I would miss nine or 10 games and he wanted someone who would be there for the whole season.\n\n\u201cI understand that but it was a sad moment, knowing that I had done everything for the club and helped them take it up to the next level.\n\n\u201cI thought they might make it a bit flexible, but that\u2019s life and ... I\u2019m happy with where I am at the moment and proud to represent my country at the World Cup.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 29 and probably looking at his only chance of playing at rugby\u2019s global showpiece, the New Zealand-born former sevens international had no hesitation.\n\n\u201cI never had the opportunity to play for my country in fifteens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the opportunity, I turned it down for something bigger.\u201d\n\nTuatagaloa\u2019s story is far from unique among the hundreds of players from Pacific islands who earn their living as professional rugby players.\n\nDAILY CALLS\n\nAnother Samoan arrived at a training camp in July only to leave a couple of hours later after being offered a club contract worth more than the $65 a day he would have earned by staying.\n\nTVNZ reported last month that a Tongan player had been offered an additional 100,000 euros ($110,650) on his contract if he did not play at the World Cup. He stayed with the club.\n\nPacific Rugby Players (PRP) union chief executive Aayden Clarke said he knew of players whose clubs, having released them for the World Cup, were now ringing them daily to entice them to turn their backs on their countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying to World Rugby: \u2018Do the players really need to go through this duress to get to the World Cup?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shocker.\u201d\n\nClarke believes the issue is directly linked to performance at the World Cup, where none of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa have qualified for the knockout stages since 2007. [nL3N2610JM]\n\nWorld Rugby funded the three nations to the tune of about $24 million over the last World Cup cycle.\n\nClarke would like to see 30% of that cash used to pay players directly.\n\n\u201cThat means the guys are being remunerated well enough to feed their families while they\u2019re on international duty,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen obviously that decreases the resistance to the clubs allowing their players to play test rugby.\u201d\n\nAny short-term change of policy from World Rugby looked unlikely on Wednesday when chairman Bill Beaumont was asked about the issue.\n\n\u201c(Regulation 9) is sacrosant and set in stone to protect our international brand,\u201d he told the opening news conference for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cBut if players choose not to play international rugby then that is their decision.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.9038 euros)", "description": "Belgium Tuatagaloa had a stark choice to make when he was called into the Samoa squad for the first time a few months before the Rugby World Cup earlier this year - sign a new club contract or play for his country.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431150778&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0K1-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
