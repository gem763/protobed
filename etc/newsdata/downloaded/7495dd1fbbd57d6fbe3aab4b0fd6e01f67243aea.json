Bernie Sanders introduced a bill that would radically change our nation\u2019s health care system, putting the government in charge of Americans\u2019 health care decision making. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s senior fellow Robert Moffit offered the following response:\n\n\n\n\u201cThis legislation would exacerbate the problems our health care system already faces and make patient choice irrelevant in health care. Whether you like it or not, the government will decide what kind of care you\u2019ll receive, and there will be no alternatives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn other countries with government-run health care, patients are often denied access to advanced medical technologies and they face longer wait times to see specialists.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven America\u2019s version of \u2018single-payer\u2019 health care, the Veterans Health Administration, has been plagued by delays and denials of crucial medical care. The result has been one of the most serious scandals in the history of the federal government\u2014where veterans languished and died because of a manipulation of the program\u2019s waiting lists.\n\n\n\n\u201cCongress owes it to America to make our health care system stronger and defeat the radical left\u2019s efforts to destroy patient choice. The Health Care Choices Proposal would allow patients to have even more control over their health care, lower health care costs and protect the most vulnerable to have continued access to care.\"\n\n", "description": "Today, Sen.
