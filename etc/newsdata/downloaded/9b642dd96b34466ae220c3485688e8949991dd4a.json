She is seeking re-election in January.\n\nChina has proposed that Taiwan be governed under a \"one country, two systems\" structure similar to Hong Kong.\n\n\"The more Taiwan shows that it's not being intimidated, the more it frustrates China's scheme,\" Yun-kung Ting, a spokesman for Taiwan's presidential office, is quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\n\nMr Wu said Kiribati's president had asked Taiwan to donate money to purchase commercial aeroplanes.\n\nTaipei assessed its finances and declined, but offered to give preferential loans instead.\n\nThose countries that have remained loyal to Taiwan are in Latin America and the Pacific, and the only European state to still do so is the Vatican.\n\nTaiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but it has never formally declared independence from the mainland.\n\nAnalysis by Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei\n\nBeijing is expected to keep wooing away more allies in coming days, ahead of two big events.\n\nOne is China's 1 October National Day celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the other is Taiwan's January presidential race.\n\nSome analysts believe Chinese President Xi Jinping is also trying to deflect attention from his two biggest headaches - the trade war and Hong Kong.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "Taiwan says Beijing is using \"dollar diplomacy\" to poach one of its last remaining allies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/35E5/production/_108879731_056637457-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
