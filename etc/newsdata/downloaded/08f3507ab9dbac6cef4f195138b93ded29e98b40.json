One tweets out nonsense like this, promising \u201cprison abolition\u201d while drawing non-existent lines between prisons and \u201capartheid\u201d in America. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims that prisons and incarceration result from the \u201csame lineage\u201d as slavery, and that \u201cdecarceration & prison abolition\u201d are the conversations of the future (via Twitchy):\n\nMass incarceration is our American reality. It is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage as Jim Crow, American apartheid, & slavery. To end it, we have to change. That means we need to have a real conversation about decarceration & prison abolition in this country. https://t.co/9E9NTAmBNi \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 7, 2019\n\nLest one think that \u201cprison abolition\u201d is hyperbole for criminal-justice reform, Ocasio-Cortez followed that up with this tweet:\n\nYesterday morning I spoke with a woman who was thrown in Rikers as a teenager. Put in solitary confinement for MONTHS, aka torture. Force-fed pills. The conditions were so bad, she too had drank out of toilets. A cage is a cage is a cage. And humans don\u2019t belong in them. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 7, 2019\n\nDoesn\u2019t the \u201cdrank out of toilets\u201d charge sound familiar? Why, yes it does. It turned out that the immigration detention facility that drew AOC\u2019s ire in that case used toilet fixtures that also included a sink and fountain. It\u2019s likely that similar fixtures are used in other detention facilities to save space and provide humane basic services.\n\nAt any rate, the demand prompts an obvious question: what do you do with human beings who commit crimes, especially violent crimes? And how do you keep them in those places without making them secure, not just from escape but also from the other \u201cguests\u201d? My guess is that the \u201creal conversation\u201d will avoid that part of the discussion at all costs to focus on the roots of the prison system in slavery, Jim Crow, apartheid, and maybe even the heartbreak of psoriasis.\n\nIf we want to get really real, Ocasio-Cortez would first have to admit being totally ignorant of the subject. Prisons and jails predate Jim Crow and American slavery by about three millennia. The English system of justice, from which ours derived, began building prisons in the twelfth century under Henry II, and was significant enough at the time that the barons forced his son King John to reform penal processes in the Magna Carta by requiring a trial. Prisons and penal colonies have persisted over the years for the same reason we have them now \u2014 because we have to isolate some criminals from society as a disincentive to crime, and to protect everyone else from the criminals.\n\nIf Ocasio-Cortez wants to put fewer people in prison, perhaps she could use her current office to begin repealing the appalling expansion of federal laws and prosecutions for crimes that truly fall within state jurisdictions. That at least would help depopulate the federal prisons to some extent, as well as make people more free overall. That, however, won\u2019t help Ocasio-Cortez put together her word salads about racism and toilet-drinking, so don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nUpdate: Hans Bader argues that we don\u2019t have a \u201cmass incarceration\u201d problem, but an under-incarceration problem. He\u2019s got some compelling data on that point as well. But even if we did have a \u201cmass incarceration\u201d problem, why would the solution to that be abolishing prisons altogether?", "description": "What's the obsession with toilets?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoc-ok.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
