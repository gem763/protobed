Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nJessica Taylor, a mother of three who runs her own business, on Monday launched her campaign for Alabama's second congressional district, blasting the New York Democrat in a video ad that quickly went viral.\n\n'Like you, I'm tired of arrogant socialists like AOC who've never even run a lemonade stand telling us how we should live in Alabama and that more government is the answer,' Taylor said in the ad.\n\n'Even though it might trigger a few liberals, I'll fight to protect life, the Second Amendment, our borders, our military, our families, and President Trump from socialists in the swamp, and I won't apologize for it,' Taylor continued.\n\n'I'm tired of arrogant socialists like AOC who've never even run a lemonade stand telling us how we should live in Alabama and that more government is the answer,' Taylor said in the ad\n\nTaylor went after Ocasio-Cortez (center) and her 'squad' of far-left House Democrats, even though none of the group represent a district close to Alabama\n\n'I have zero interest in being a career politician. But conservatives like us need a squad of our own \u2014 and I'll build it,' Taylor concluded.\n\nTaylor is the sixth Republican to announce for the seat after the incumbent, Rep. Martha Roby, announced she would not seek re-election.\n\nThe district is safely Republican, and no Democrats have even filed to run there.

She is seen above at a rally in Queens over the weekend, where she endorsed Bernie Sanders for president\n\nTaylor's ad quickly gained traction online, and she was invited on Fox & Friends on Tuesday\n\n'We need somebody who can convince my generation and others that more government is not the answer. More government is the problem,' Taylor told the Fox & Friends hosts.\n\n'We are small-town Alabama and looking forward to representing the people of this district. [Socialism] concerns me greatly and that's why I'm running,' said Taylor.\n\nAfter earning a law degree from Faulkner University, Taylor got her start in government in 2008, reviewing and managing grant proposals in the Alabama governor's office.\n\nShe later started a private company, Azimuth, that consults with companies and non-profits on securing public and private grants.", "description": "Jessica Taylor, a mother of three who runs her own business, on Monday launched her campaign for Alabama's second congressional district, blasting the New York Democrat in a video ad.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/19/20048594-0-image-a-20_1571769387561.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
