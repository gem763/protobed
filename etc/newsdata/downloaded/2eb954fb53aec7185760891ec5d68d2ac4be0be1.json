The results were variable on a covers-heavy set with folk and country influences on some downbeat but effective originals such as \u201cNo Reply\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a Loser\u201d, while \u201cEight Days a Week\u201d represents the pinnacle of the Lennon/McCartney writing partnership before they began to write less and less together. However, with too much filler and some perfunctory covers, Beatles For Sale hasn\u2019t stood the test of time as well as any of their other 1962-1966 (\u201cThe Red Album\u201d) era long players, resulting in its low position here. 3/12 10. Let It Be (1970) The messy break-up album recorded under trying circumstances contains a few tracks I would be happy never to hear again but any album that includes \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cLet It Be\u201d, \u201cThe Long and Winding Road\u201d (with or without Phil Spector\u2019s ethereal choir and strings which McCartney hated), and Lennon and McCartney harmonising together for the first time in years on \u201cTwo of Us\u201c has to have something going for it. Ultimately, therefore, Let It Be proved something of a sad but not entirely unworthy epitaph for the greatest pop group ever. 4/12 9. With the Beatles (1963) Between their first and second albums The Beatles had three No 1 singles \u2013 \u201cFrom Me to You\u201d, \u201cShe Loves You\u201d and \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d \u2013 but the temptation to include any of them on their second long-player was resisted. However, with 14 tracks on With the Beatles, the band couldn\u2019t be accused of not giving value for money, even if it duplicated their first album with six covers, including several impressive nods to their love of Motown on \u201cPlease Mr Postman\u201d, \u201cYou Really Got a Hold on Me\u201d and \u201cMoney\u201d. Elsewhere, George, who surprisingly has three solo vocals on the album, as many as Paul, tears up \u201cRoll Over Beethoven\u201d while McCartney\u2019s \u201cAll My Loving\u201d is still one of the group\u2019s most loved early songs. It\u2019s an album largely dominated by Lennon however, and he excels on \u201cIt Won\u2019t Be Long\u201d \u201cNot a Second Time\u201d and the aforementioned \u201cMoney\u201d. 5/12 8. Please Please Me (1963) The tone of the thrilling debut that launched the Fab Four into pop music history is set by Paul on the opening track as he counts in \u201cI Saw Her Standing There\u201d (\u201cOne, Two, Three, Four!\u201d). Lennon\u2019s justly lauded, throat-tearing version of \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d bookends the album and in between there\u2019s a mix of originals and covers including a fine Harrison vocal on \u201cDo You Want to Know a Secret\u201d and the first two hits \u201cLove Me Do\u201d and the euphoric title track as the band struck up an immediate rapport with producer George Martin, even if George (Harrison) didn\u2019t like his tie. Almost half the 14 tracks were cover versions, and as such, Please Please Me is an undeniably raw, but breathless and brilliant rush through the band\u2019s live act of the day, with Ringo proving conclusively that he was the right man for the job. It also points to the future of pop music as acts more and more began to write their own material, and remains one of the great debut albums. 6/12 7. Help! (1965) A tie-in with the band\u2019s second film, Help! was a considerable improvement on previous album Beatles For Sale, and in truth is a bit of a mixed bag, but the best songs are very good indeed, rising to classic status with \u201cTicket to Ride\u201d, McCartney\u2019s \u201cYesterday\u201d \u2013 the ultimate Beatles standard \u2013 and the title track, which was Lennon\u2019s very real cry for help. Bob Dylan\u2019s influence permeated Lennon\u2019s superb \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away\u201d and McCartney\u2019s countrified \u201cI\u2019ve Just Seen a Face\u201d rolls and tumbles sumptuously, and then there\u2019s the bittersweet \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Lose That Girl\u201d \u2013 a cavalcade of riches that emphatically compensate for some of the lesser tracks on show. 7/12 6. A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964) Partly the soundtrack of their first movie which amounts to their first quantum leap with all 13 tracks penned by Lennon and McCartney. The Beatles\u2019 third album was light years ahead of the opposition in their homeland in 1964, from the moment it announced itself with the epochal opening chord on George\u2019s new Rickenbacker 12-string on the famous title track. Lennon sang or composed the bulk of the songs, with \u201cI Should Have Known Better\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Back\u201d particular highlights, but McCartney owned three of the most lustrous jewels in \u201cAnd I Love Her\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d and the band\u2019s most sophisticated song to date, \u201cThings We Said Today\u201d. 8/12 5. Rubber Soul (1965) The Beatles entered their seminal middle period with another seismic leap in quality with their first true masterpiece which, although influenced by soul and Dylan, proved so influential itself that it spurred contemporaries such as Brian Wilson to hitherto unimagined heights. The quality control barely lapsed over the fourteen tracks with the band never tighter than on the opening \u201cDrive My Car\u201d and then the innovations flowed. Harrison's sitar on Lennon's sublime confessional \u201dNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown\u201d), double-tracked vocals on several tracks, fuzz bass on Harrison's \u201cThink For Yourself\u201d, which along with \u201dIf I Needed Someone\u201d demonstrated that Harrison had arrived as a songwriter of note, and who can forget Lennon's intake of breath on the superlative \u201cGirl\u201d? McCartney tossed off another standard in \u201dMichelle\u201d. 9/12 4. The Beatles (1968) The sprawling \u201cWhite Album\u201d was recorded in an atmosphere of tension and strained relationships as the group disintegrated, yet somehow a work of great quality emerged, even if it was the product of the four individual members pulling in different directions. There\u2019s little cohesion here in the scattershot mix of styles, just a lot of great songs interspersed with some not so great songs, and some rubbish. With 30 tracks, there is much merit in the oft-repeated claim that with some judicious pruning, The Beatles could have been the greatest single album of all time. A snapshot of just some of the great songs includes McCartney\u2019s \u201cBlackbird\u201d, \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d, \u201cBack in the USSR\u201d and \u201cBirthday\u201d; Lennon\u2019s \u201cJulia\u201d, \u201cDear Prudence\u201d, \u201cHappiness is a Warm Gun\u201d and \u201cRevolution 1\u201d, while Harrison\u2019s stellar contributions include \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and \u201cLong, Long, Long\u201d. With that quality, single album or not, it would still have to be a heck of a long album. 10/12 3. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) Five decades and more since its release, Sgt Pepper, with its \u201cband within a band\u201d concept and drugs-influenced vibe still reigns imperiously as the most famous pop record ever made. It may now not be considered the greatest album ever recorded, or indeed the greatest Beatles album, but with George Martin at the peak of his powers and the band now retired from touring, they were able to hone their mastery of the studio. Sgt Pepper remains a piece of art that in terms of experimentation, innovation and influence has rarely, if ever, been bettered. It contains some of the band\u2019s most-loved songs \u2013 \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends\u201d, \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds\u201d, a genuine masterpiece for the ages in \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home\u201d, and their greatest, \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d, but overall, the album\u2019s greatness lies in the old cliche of the sum being greater than the parts. 11/12 2. Abbey Road (1969) With Let it Be in the can but not yet deemed fit for release due to the fractious nature of the recordings, Abbey Road was chronologically the last Beatles album to be recorded. Fittingly, although many of the tracks were the products of the individual members, Abbey Road reunited the band for one last magnificent stand. Abbey Road is justly celebrated for the McCartney-led 16 minute medley on side two commencing with \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d and concluding beautifully and with appropriately with \u201dThe End\u201d, but it's also a side that begins with Harrison's \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d. 12/12 1. Revolver (1966) For a good number of years, Revolver lay in Sgt Pepper's shadow - universally admired to be sure, but somehow a little harder to love than previous simpler pleasures and Pepper itself. Part of that may be due to the mind-blowing eclecticism and scale of ambition of the album, which all these years later still astounds. The influence of drugs, psychedelia, and Eastern religion came to the fore on Revolver with double-tracked guitars, reversed tape loops, varispeed and various sound effects as the band, with George Martin an equal partner, fully explored the boundless sonic possibilities of the studio. 1/12 12. Yellow Submarine (1969) Not as bad as popular myth would have it, nevertheless, the soundtrack to the band\u2019s animated movie is the one Beatles album that comes closest to a \u201cfile under \u2013 for completists only\u201d rating. The best-known songs \u2013 \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d and \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d are available on innumerable compilations, and of the four new songs, only Lennon\u2019s raw and menacing \u201cHey Bulldog\u201d hits the mark. 2/12 11.

However, with too much filler and some perfunctory covers, Beatles For Sale hasn\u2019t stood the test of time as well as any of their other 1962-1966 (\u201cThe Red Album\u201d) era long players, resulting in its low position here. 3/12 10.

Bob Dylan\u2019s influence permeated Lennon\u2019s superb \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away\u201d and McCartney\u2019s countrified \u201cI\u2019ve Just Seen a Face\u201d rolls and tumbles sumptuously, and then there\u2019s the bittersweet \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Lose That Girl\u201d \u2013 a cavalcade of riches that emphatically compensate for some of the lesser tracks on show.\n\n6 A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964)\n\nPartly the soundtrack of their first movie which amounts to their first quantum leap with all 13 tracks penned by Lennon and McCartney. The Beatles\u2019 third album was light years ahead of the opposition in their homeland in 1964, from the moment it announced itself with the epochal opening chord on George\u2019s new Rickenbacker 12-string on the famous title track. Lennon sang or composed the bulk of the songs, with \u201cI Should Have Known Better\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Back\u201d particular highlights, but McCartney owned three of the most lustrous jewels in \u201cAnd I Love Her\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d and the band\u2019s most sophisticated song to date, \u201cThings We Said Today\u201d.\n\n5 Rubber Soul (1965)\n\nThe Beatles entered their seminal middle period with another seismic leap in quality with their first true masterpiece which, although influenced by soul and Dylan, proved so influential itself that it spurred contemporaries such as Brian Wilson to hitherto unimagined heights. The quality control barely lapsed over the 14 tracks, with the band never tighter than on the opening \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, and then the innovations flowed. Harrison\u2019s sitar on Lennon\u2019s sublime confessional \u201cNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\u201d, double-tracked vocals on several tracks, fuzz bass on Harrison\u2019s \u201cThink For Yourself\u201d, which along with \u201cIf I Needed Someone\u201d demonstrated that Harrison had arrived as a songwriter of note, and who can forget Lennon\u2019s intake of breath on the superlative \u201cGirl\u201d? McCartney tossed off another standard in \u201cMichelle\u201d and there are several deeply personal songs, with Lennon\u2019s \u201cNowhere Man\u201d articulating his despair at the vacuum in his personal life and McCartney documenting his turbulent relationship with Jane Asher on \u201cYou Won\u2019t See Me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Looking Through You\u201d. But the jewel in the Lennon canon then and forever after is \u201cIn My Life\u201d, which would rank near the top of any list of Beatles greatest songs. Rubber Soul confirmed once and for all that The Beatles were the unimpeachable masters of their craft as the music world held its breath in anticipation of their next move.\n\n4 The Beatles (1968)\n\nThe sprawling \u201cWhite Album\u201d was recorded in an atmosphere of tension and strained relationships as the group disintegrated, yet somehow a work of great quality emerged, even if it was the product of the four individual members pulling in different directions. There\u2019s little cohesion here in the scattershot mix of styles, just a lot of great songs interspersed with some not so great songs, and some rubbish. With 30 tracks, there is much merit in the oft-repeated claim that with some judicious pruning, The Beatles could have been the greatest single album of all time. A snapshot of just some of the great songs includes McCartney\u2019s \u201cBlackbird\u201d, \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d, \u201cBack in the USSR\u201d and \u201cBirthday\u201d; Lennon\u2019s \u201cJulia\u201d, \u201cDear Prudence\u201d, \u201cHappiness is a Warm Gun\u201d and \u201cRevolution 1\u201d, while Harrison\u2019s stellar contributions include \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and \u201cLong, Long, Long\u201d. With that quality, single album or not, it would still have to be a heck of a long album.\n\n3 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\n\nFive decades and more since its release, Sgt Pepper, with its \u201cband within a band\u201d concept and drugs-influenced vibe still reigns imperiously as the most famous pop record ever made. It may now not be considered the greatest album ever recorded, or indeed the greatest Beatles album, but with George Martin at the peak of his powers and the band now retired from touring, they were able to hone their mastery of the studio. Sgt Pepper remains a piece of art that in terms of experimentation, innovation and influence has rarely, if ever, been bettered. It contains some of the band\u2019s most-loved songs \u2013 \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends\u201d, \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds\u201d, a genuine masterpiece for the ages in \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home\u201d, and their greatest, \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d, but overall, the album\u2019s greatness lies in the old cliche of the sum being greater than the parts.\n\n2 Abbey Road (1969)\n\nWith Let It Be in the can but not yet deemed fit for release due to the fractious nature of the recordings, Abbey Road was chronologically the last Beatles album to be recorded. Fittingly, although many of the tracks were the products of the individual members, Abbey Road reunited the band for one last magnificent stand. The album is justly celebrated for the McCartney-led 16-minute medley on side two, commencing with \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d and concluding beautifully and appropriately with \u201cThe End\u201d, but it\u2019s also a side that begins with Harrison\u2019s \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d. Side one finds \u201cSomething\u201d, perhaps Harrison\u2019s greatest song, while Lennon is at his acerbic best on \u201cCome Together\u201d. The seven-minute-plus \u201cI Want You\u201d is The Beatles at their heaviest and most together and surely only the stoniest of hearts can\u2019t love Ringo\u2019s \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d. But for people of a certain vintage, nothing before or since has topped that glorious side two of half-finished songs that became known as \u201cThe Long One\u201d.\n\n1 Revolver (1966)\n\nFor a good number of years, Revolver lay in Sgt Pepper\u2019s shadow \u2013 universally admired to be sure, but somehow a little harder to love than previous simpler pleasures and Pepper itself. Part of that may be due to the mind-blowing eclecticism and scale of ambition of the album, which all these years later still astounds. The influence of drugs, psychedelia and eastern religion came to the fore on Revolver, with double-tracked guitars, reversed tape loops, varispeed and various sound effects as the band, with George Martin an equal partner, fully explored the boundless sonic possibilities of the studio. There are 14 tracks on Revolver and every one of them leaves an indelible mark, from George\u2019s scathing opener \u201cTaxman\u201d to the final track, Lennon\u2019s astonishingly futuristic \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d. In between, we have high art from McCartney with the haunting \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d complete with double-string quartet, and the poignant \u201cFor No One\u201d, and yet another ballad standard, \u201cHere, There and Everywhere\u201d, and he also excels on the horn-driven \u201cGot to Get You into My Life\u201d and the glorious \u201cGood Day Sunshine\u201d. \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d finds Lennon at a creative peak, and he almost matches it on the Dylanesque \u201cAnd Your Bird Can Sing\u201d and the psychedelic tour de force \u201cShe Said She Said\u201d, while the backward guitar solo and Lennon\u2019s hazy vocal on \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping\u201d sum up the rampant experimentation of Revolver. No longer overshadowed by Sgt Pepper, its predecessor is an album that has grown in stature and reputation through the decades and long ago usurped Pepper as the Beatles\u2019 finest hour. For many critics, Revolver is the greatest album ever made, an argument I\u2019ll save for another day, but for now, it reigns as The Beatles\u2019 greatest album.", "description": "On\u00a026\u00a0September 1969, the last album recorded by The Beatles was released.
