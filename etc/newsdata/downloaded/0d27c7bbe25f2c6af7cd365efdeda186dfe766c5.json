Seth Harrison/lohud, The Journal News/lohud\n\nChelsea Clinton ended speculation that she might run for Congress next year during an appearance on the talk show \"The View\" on Wednesday.\n\nClinton, 39, emerged as a possible candidate immediately following 30-year Rep. Nita Lowey's announcement on Thursday she wouldn't seek reelection in 2020.\n\nShe was considered a frontrunner in what is expected to be a crowded field, even though Clinton herself never said she was considering entering the race. On Wednesday, she directly addressed the rumors.\n\n\"I'm not considering running for Congresswoman Lowey's seat,\" Clinton said in response to a question from co-host Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nChelsea Clinton: Could Chelsea Clinton run for a New York House seat?\n\n.@ChelseaClinton shuts down rumors she's considering running for Congress: \"I'm not considering running for Congresswoman Lowey's seat.\" https://t.co/f8u2wc159Spic.twitter.com/HwG3ieCOkl \u2014 The View (@TheView) October 16, 2019\n\nClinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said she understood why people asked her about running.\n\n\"Someone has asked me some version of this question literally as long as I can remember,\" she said before recounting that she remembers being asked if she'd run for governor of Arkansas at age 3 or 4.\n\n\"I share that because I think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of people whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\" she said, referring to co-host Abby Huntsman, the daughter of former Utah governor and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Hunstman.\n\n\"It\u2019s a question we should be asking kids, like, 'Do you think about running for office one day?'\" she said. \"I hope that if the answer to that question is, 'Yes, I'm considering it,' that you'll really think about doing it and go to run for something.\"\n\nShe said she wasn't sure if she'd run for office one day, but \"right now, the answer's no.\"\n\nOctober debate: Here are the winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate\n\nLowey, 82, is a longtime fixture in New York's 17th Congressional District, which includes Rockland County and part of Westchester County.\n\nClinton's parents have lived in the ritzy hamlet of Chappaqua in the Westchester part of the district since leaving the White House at the turn of the century.\n\nChelsea Clinton lives outside of the district in New York City, but the U.S. Constitution doesn't require a House member to live within the district he or she represents.\n\nLowey, chairwoman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, is the first woman to head the committee. Since the district is reliably blue and overwhelmingly Democratic, her retirement has sparked interest from a number of local Democrats.\n\n'To me it will always be Columbus Day.': Trump dismisses criticism of Christopher Columbus\n\nBut the Clinton name propelled her to the front of the pack without so much as a public statement from the would-be candidate, and drew comparisons to Lowey's own abandoned U.S. Senate race in 2000.\n\nThe congresswoman, a Harrison resident, had eyed a run for the Senate seat that year but stepped aside to allow Hillary Clinton a clear path to the nomination.\n\nHillary Clinton went on to win election against Republican Rick Lazio.\n\nIn 2006, she won reelection to the Senate against former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, now a Fox News host and friend of President Donald Trump.\n\nClinton left the Senate in 2009 after running unsuccessfully for president to become President Barack Obama's Secretary of State.\n\nWith Chelsea Clinton out of the running for the seat, there are two Democrats who are officially seeking the party nomination: David Buchwald, a state Assemblyman from White Plains who once interned for Lowey, and Mondaire Jones, who launched a primary challenge from the left in July well before Lowey's announcement she wouldn't seek reelection.\n\nDebate: CNN slammed for asking about Ellen, but not climate change, at Democratic debate\n\nJones, 38, grew up in Spring Valley and attended Harvard Law School, raised $218,000 since launching his candidacy with the goal of becoming the first gay black man elected to Congress.\n\nRegistered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in the 17th district, according to state Board of Elections figures.\n\nRegistered voters without party affiliation also outnumber Republicans in the district, 110,000-103,000, according to state active voter numbers.\n\nFollow Mark Lungariello on Facebook: @lungariello; and Twitter: @marklungariello.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/16/chelsea-clinton-congress-nita-lowey-us-house-of-representatives/3998039002/", "description": "Speculation has been rampant that Clinton could run for Rep.
