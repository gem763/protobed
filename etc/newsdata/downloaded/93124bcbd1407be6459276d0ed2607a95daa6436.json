Last year, The CW rebooted the series and premiered season one of Roswell, New Mexico in January this year.\n\nNow, Jason Behr \u2013 who played alien in disguise Max Evans in the original series \u2013 will be joining season two, but his new role is currently \u2018top secret\u2019, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nWhen the original show aired, the character of Max Evans was a high school student. But in Roswell, New Mexico, the character has joined the Chaves County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nExecutive producer Carina Adley MacKenzie said: \u2018We\u2019re very excited that Jason will be joining us for a multi-episode arc.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s only fitting that he\u2019s playing a (currently top secret) character with deep ties to Roswell, New Mexico\u2019s history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Working with him has already been such a special experience for all of us \u2013 particularly when [Roswell co-star] Shiri Appleby was on set to direct him.\n\nOriginal cast of Roswell (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I was such a huge fan of Roswell as a kid, so having their stamp of approval \u2013 not to mention their expertise and advice \u2013 has really meant the world to me, the cast and the crew,\u2019 she added.\n\nIn April, the series was renewed for a second season.\n\nJason was nominated for two Saturn awards for his role in Roswell. In 2004 he had a starring role alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar \u2013 who he had previously worked with for one episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer \u2013 in the horror film The Grudge.\n\nIt was on that set that he met his wife, KaDee Strickland, the star of Secret And Lies, and the pair now have a baby boy.\n\nThe premise of the show is based on the conspiracy theory of an alien spaceship landing in Roswell in 1947.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
