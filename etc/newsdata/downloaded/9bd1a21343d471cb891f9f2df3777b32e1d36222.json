Others brag about their polo ponies. Then there are the ones with a direct line to the White House and a willingness to operate outside their mandates \u2014 with enough money on hand to cover the legal fees from a congressional investigation.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s politically appointed ambassadors have long drawn skepticism, even resentment, from career U.S. diplomats. Now, as an impeachment inquiry exposes some of their more questionable activities and threatens the career of a traditional envoy, the anger toward them is rising.\n\nCurrent and former career U.S. diplomats say Trump has handed far too many ambassadorial posts to unqualified candidates, many of whom were political donors with thin diplomatic resumes and little respect for the U.S. Foreign Service.\n\nSome say it\u2019s time to rethink, if not cap or outright bar, political appointments for ambassadorships.\n\n\u201cIt is out of whack under Trump,\u201d said Dana Shell Smith, a former career Foreign Service officer who served as the U.S. ambassador to Qatar. \u201cThese ambassadorships are being seen as the spoils, as opposed to being very serious jobs that act in the interest of the country.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former U.S. diplomats say they\u2019re alarmed by the implications of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s findings so far.\n\nMost modern presidents have given roughly 30 percent of U.S. ambassador postings to political appointees, with the rest drawn from career government ranks. Under Trump, the proportions appear to have changed significantly. At present, nearly 45 percent of his ambassador picks \u2014 people who have been confirmed or are awaiting confirmation \u2014 are political appointees, one database shows.\n\nThe statistics have deeply frustrated the diplomats\u2019 union, the American Foreign Service Association, which is calling on Trump to reevaluate his approach.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, Eric Rubin, said in a statement to POLITICO that the Foreign Service Act of 1980 specifies ambassadorships should \u201cnormally be accorded to career members of the Service,\u201d with only occasional exceptions for qualified outsiders.\n\n\u201cAFSA does not believe that asking to follow the law is a radical position,\u201d Rubin said, adding that the Trump-era numbers are \u201cdismaying.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former U.S. diplomats, including those who\u2019ve been ambassadors, stress there have been some excellent political appointees in the past, and that not all career appointees are perfect. But they\u2019re alarmed by the implications of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s findings so far.\n\nThe ongoing investigation has uncovered evidence that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, was operating outside the usual State Department chain of command to pressure the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that could help Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nSondland is a hotel owner who reportedly donated $1 million for Trump\u2019s inauguration and had no notable diplomatic experience before being named to the Brussels-based post. Ukraine is not a member of the EU, making Sondland\u2019s involvement in its affairs even more odd.\n\nBut the envoy, like a handful of other political appointee ambassadors, is known to have a direct line to Trump, another reason congressional investigators are keen to understand his activities. This week, the State Department ordered Sondland not to testify before Congress, but he\u2019s been subpoenaed and has said he will appear before lawmakers.\n\nAlso caught up in the impeachment inquiry is Marie Yovanovitch, a highly regarded Foreign Service officer named ambassador to Ukraine under President Barack Obama. Yovanovitch was pulled out of Kyiv in May, a few months before she was due to leave the post, under murky circumstances.\n\nWhat is known is that the president\u2019s allies had for months spread rumors about her, claiming she was anti-Trump. Trump himself called her \u201cbad news\u201d and seemed to vaguely threaten her while talking to Ukraine\u2019s president, according to detailed call notes released by the White House.\n\nUnder Trump, many of the political appointees \u201chave absolutely no understanding of U.S. government policy and State Department policy. They don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing\u201d \u2014 Former U.S. ambassador\n\n\n\nIn closed-door testimony before lawmakers Friday, Yovanovitch asserted that Trump had forced her out of her position based on \"unfounded and false claims.\" She also warned lawmakers that many of \u201cthis nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants\u201d are looking to quit.\n\nDemocrats said the State Department and White House had tried to bar Yovanovitch's testimony, but investigating House committees had issued a subpoena and she'd complied with it.\n\nNeither the State Department nor the White House responded to requests for comment on this story.\n\nLast week, AFSA sent out a notice to its diplomats asking them to donate money to a legal defense fund \u201cfor members with legal issues that involve possible far-reaching significance to the rest of the Service, such as cases involving due process or fundamental fairness.\u201d\n\nAccording to an AFSA official, it was the first time in several years that the group had sent out such a solicitation, which was first reported by Foreign Policy. Although AFSA did not mention Yovanovitch by name, many career U.S. diplomats are donating to the fund because they are furious with how she\u2019s been treated.\n\nSuch career diplomats point out that they are sworn to serve the U.S. government in a nonpartisan way, meaning they implement the policies of whoever is in the White House. Trump, instead, has cast them and other career government staffers as a \u201cdeep state\u201d bent on thwarting him.\n\nUnder Trump, many of the political appointees \u201chave absolutely no understanding of U.S. government policy and State Department policy. They don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing,\u201d one former U.S. ambassador said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nSome career diplomats say it also feels like there\u2019s more of a cultural clash with the Trump crew than political appointees from past administrations, though they agree it\u2019s tough to quantify the phenomenon.\n\nThe former ambassador described how, during a get-to-know-you gathering of U.S. envoys last year, a political appointee was asked when he was going to return to his post. \u201cHe said, \u2018I have my private plane here, so I\u2019ll go back when I want to,\u2019\u201d the former ambassador recalled. \u201cIt was like, how far removed are these people from normal American life?\u201d\n\nAnother former U.S. ambassador who was at the same event said the atmosphere was starkly different than a similar gathering held two years earlier under Obama.\n\nThen, the political appointees \u2014 many of whom were also fairly wealthy \u2014 eagerly talked to their career counterparts about the latest gossip. Under Trump, the political appointees largely kept to themselves, the former U.S. ambassador said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really get any conversations going,\u201d the former envoy said.\n\nSome of the political appointees derisively referred to career staffers who worked for them as \u201cObama holdovers,\u201d even if those employees had been in government for decades. There was even talk of \u201cObama ambassadors,\u201d in reference to veteran U.S. envoys from the career ranks.\n\nElizabeth Warren, one of the top Democrats seeking her party\u2019s nomination, has promised not to give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers.\n\nOne Trump political appointee, the U.S. ambassador to Spain, Duke Buchan III, is known for his love of polo and the horses he raises, which in the sport are referred to as \u201cponies.\u201d\n\nDuring the same 2018 event, Buchan complained about the European Union having too many onerous regulations, making it hard for him to ship over his polo ponies to Spain, according to another person who attended the event.\n\nBuchan is fluent in Spanish and has long studied the culture. But he had no serious diplomatic experience before Trump nominated him for the Madrid post; he had, however, given hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the president\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn response to multiple emails, Buchan, via an embassy spokesperson, did not deny that he\u2019d wanted to bring over his horses or say whether he ever did. The spokesman said, however: \u201cAmbassador Buchan is only concerned about EU regulations that affect the security and prosperity of the American people.\u201d\n\nPolitical appointee ambassadors known for having especially close relations with Trump include Richard Grenell, the U.S. envoy in Germany and David Friedman, Trump\u2019s point man in Israel.\n\nFriedman was a bankruptcy lawyer who spent years working for Trump. He has helped convince Trump to adopt a number of stridently pro-Israel positions, including moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nGrenell has past diplomatic experience, having served as the spokesman for the U.S. at the United Nations for several years. Berlin is still getting used to his outspokenness; he\u2019d barely set foot in Germany before demanding that German companies stop doing any business with Iran.\n\nTo the surprise of many in the career ranks, Grenell was recently given another responsibility on top of his ambassadorship: serving as a special envoy for peace negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo.\n\nOne of his biggest fans is Donald Trump Jr., who in March tweeted out a conservative website story about Yovanovitch with the comment: \u201cWe need more \u2066 @RichardGrenell\u2019s and less of these jokers as ambassadors.\u201c\n\nDennis Jett, author of \u201c American Ambassadors: The Past, Present, and Future of America\u2019s Diplomats,\u201d noted that the exact breakdown of Trump\u2019s preference for political appointees versus career appointees won\u2019t truly be known until after he leaves office.\n\nThat\u2019s because the math isn\u2019t static \u2014 there\u2019s constant turnover in the positions and Trump, unlike his predecessors, pushed out the previous administration\u2019s political appointees immediately upon taking office. But Jett agreed that more big-money donors appear to be getting slots than usual.\n\nThe issue has even drawn attention on the 2020 campaign trial. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the top Democrats seeking her party\u2019s nomination, has promised not to give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers.\n\nWarren has used the uproar over the Ukraine-related impeachment inquiry to push her plan. In a tweet on Oct. 8, she wrote: \u201cGordon Sondland, our Ambassador to the European Union, got his job after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. We need to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors.\u201d\n\nHer promise got a thumbs up from one of Barack Obama\u2019s most prominent politically appointed ambassadors: Michael McFaul, who served in Russia. McFaul is often held up by career appointees as an example of a qualified political appointee; he was a Russia expert who had U.S. government experience before being named ambassador.\n\n\u201cI agree with @ewarren,\u201d McFaul tweeted. \u201cThe time to change this practice of selling ambassadorial posts is now. (Presidents can still pick their own ambassadors, but based on qualifications & expertise, not donor contributions.)\u201d\n\nMcFaul later added in a separate tweet: \u201cYes, I was a political appointee. I gave Obama $250.\u201c", "description": "Investigation prompts calls for a revamp of how ambassadors are appointed.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi", "Nancy Cook", "Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180515943-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
