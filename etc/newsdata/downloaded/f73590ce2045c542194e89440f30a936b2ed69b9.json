But he deserves credit for not letting Trump 2020 primary challenger Joe Walsh off the hook for his history of horrendous commentary on this week\u2019s episode.\n\nWalsh got a warm welcome from Maher\u2019s audience when he joined the show at the midway point Friday night. \u201cApparently they don\u2019t know your history, Joe,\u201d the host said when the applause died down.\n\nMaher pointed out that Walsh doesn\u2019t like that Trump \u201clies\u201d or that he\u2019s a \u201ctraitor,\u201d but \u201cissue-wise,\u201d they\u2019re not that far apart.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done some good things,\u201d Walsh admitted as Maher listed off a variety of conservative positions he shares with the president.\n\n\u201cJoe, you were a leader of the anti-Obama nutcase caucus,\u201d Maher said as Walsh tried to distance himself from the man who launched his political career on Birtherism.\n\nAs he\u2019s done before, Walsh confessed that he helped pave the way for Trump but unlike others in the media, Maher would not let the candidate paint himself as some sort of anti-Trump savior.\n\nWalsh attempted to contrast himself with the current president by saying, \u201cI do not and will not lie every time I open my mouth,\u201d but he put that promise to the test when Maher grilled him on the way he repeated about President Obama during the previous administration.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve had to answer a lot of questions about race,\u201d Maher said. Last month, Walsh said on MSNBC that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t call\u201d himself a racist but conceded that he\u2019s \u201csaid racist things on Twitter.\u201d Maher sarcastically called that a \u201cfine distinction.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust look me in the eye and tell me that the seething, frothing hatred that I remember that you had for Barack Obama had nothing to do with the fact that he was black,\u201d Maher said.\n\n\u201cOh, gosh no,\u201d Walsh replied incredulously, claiming that his birther-inspired comments labeling Obama a \u201cMuslim\u201d had everything to do with his \u201cpolicies.\u201d The host didn\u2019t seem to be buying it.\n\nFinally, Maher asked the former Trump supporter why anyone should vote for him if it took him until 2019 to \u201cknow that Donald Trump was full of shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d Walsh said, explaining that he actually \u201cfound religion\u201d in 2018.", "description": "\u201cJoe, you were a leader of the anti-Obama nutcase caucus,\u201d Maher told the Trump challenger.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567833221/BM_tqdooh", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
