Together, the planes have accumulated a total of 2,895 days on-orbit\n\nThe aircraft's latest trip, called the Orbital Test Vehicle-5 (OTV-5), began on September 7th, 2017. It launched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from at NASA's Kennedy Space Center\n\nThe aircraft's latest trip, called the Orbital Test Vehicle-5 (OTV-5), started on September 7th, 2017.\n\nIt launched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.\n\nOfficials have revealed few details about the OTV-5 mission but there has been a suggestion it could be part of a push for a US Space Force.\n\nThe plane is 29 feet (8.8 metres) long, 9.6 feet (2.9 metres) tall and weighs around 11,000 lbs. (4,990 kilograms).\n\nPowered by solar cells with lithium-ion batteries, the plane was orbiting at around 200 miles (320 kilometres) high.\n\nLittle is known about what it was carrying but on board OTV-5's payload was a US thermal spreader which tests the longevity of electronics and heat pipes in the space environment.\n\nDutch astronomer Ralf Vandebergh captured rare photographs of the X-37B in orbit in June\n\nThe artist rendition above shows what the spaceplane might look like orbiting the earth\n\nKnown as the Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader, or ASETS-II, it was developed by the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), to test experimental electronics and oscillating heat pipes for long-duration stints in the space environment.\n\nAccording to the AFRL, the payload's three primary science objectives are to measure the initial on-orbit thermal performance, to measure long-duration thermal performance and to assess any lifetime degradation.\n\nIn June last year, President Donald Trump announced that he is directing the Pentagon to a new Space Force as an independent service branch aimed at ensuring American dominance in space.\n\nThe president framed space as a national security issue, saying he does not want 'China and Russia and other countries leading us'.\n\nOne expert has suggested that this aircraft could already be part of an early US Space Force.\n\n'Ironically, the X-37B is exactly the type of program \u2014 toward giving the U.S. flexibility of operations in space \u2014 that seems to be prompting the current push for a Space Force, yet are already underway,' Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor in the National Security Affairs Department at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, told Space.com.\n\nFour previous X-37B missions have been launched by United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets.\n\nEach time the unmanned space plane has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit.\n\n'The many firsts on this mission make the upcoming OTV launch a milestone for the program,' Walden said at the launch last year.\n\n'It is our goal to continue advancing the X-37B OTV so it can more fully support the growing space community.'\n\nThe Air Force is preparing to launch the sixth X-37B mission in 2020.", "description": "The pilotless spaceplane, which has been conducting classified research in the secretive Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV) program, landed at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/18/20251736-0-image-a-9_1572201301852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
