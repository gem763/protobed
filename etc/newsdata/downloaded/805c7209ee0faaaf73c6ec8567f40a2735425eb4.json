Bolton, then the national security adviser, that he told an aide to alert White House lawyers, House investigators were told on Monday.\n\nBolton got into a tense exchange on July 10 with Gordon D. Sondland, the Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union, who was working with Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to three people who heard the testimony.\n\nThe aide, Fiona Hill, testified that Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Sondland, Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the people familiar with the testimony.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton, a Yale-trained lawyer, told Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to two people at the deposition. (Another person in the room initially said Bolton referred to Giuliani and Mulvaney, but two others said he cited Sondland.)\n\nIt was not the first time Bolton expressed grave concerns to Hill about the campaign being run by Giuliani. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d Hill quoted Bolton as saying during an earlier conversation.\n\nThe testimony revealed in a powerful way just how divisive Giuliani\u2019s efforts to extract damaging information about Democrats from Ukraine on Trump\u2019s behalf were within the White House. Hill, the senior director for European and Russian affairs, testified that Giuliani and his allies circumvented the usual national security process to run their own foreign policy efforts, leaving the president\u2019s official advisers aware of the rogue operation yet powerless to stop it.\n\nAt one point, she confronted Sondland, who had inserted himself into dealings with Ukraine even though it was not part of his official portfolio, according to the people informed about Hill\u2019s testimony.\n\nHe told her that he was in charge of Ukraine, a moment she compared to Secretary of State Alexander Haig\u2019s declaration that he was in charge after the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt, according to those who heard the testimony.\n\nAccording to whom, she asked.\n\nThe president, he answered.\n\nHill was the first former White House official to testify in the House impeachment inquiry, and her account provided a gripping in-the-room view of the shadow maneuvers that have jeopardized Trump\u2019s presidency. While she left her post shortly before the now-famous July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Democrats, she helped House investigators understand the early months of the pressure campaign.\n\nThe daylong interview with Hill came as House Democrats widened their net in the fast-paced inquiry by summoning Michael McKinley, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who abruptly resigned last week, to testify Wednesday.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff speaks with reporters outside the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility at the Capitol in Washington, on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019.
