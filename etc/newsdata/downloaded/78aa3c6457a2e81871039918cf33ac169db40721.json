The neighborhood grocery chain specializes in its own, sometimes shockingly affordable, creations, especially ready-to-eat items. Some of them are hits (if you\u2019ve never had the West Coast-centric sourdough bread or restaurant-style tortilla chips, you\u2019re missing out) but others don\u2019t quite live up to the brand.\n\nPart of the genius of Trader Joe\u2019s lies in its constant experimentation with new products, including seasonal merchandise, to see how they sell. At any of its hundreds of stores in the U.S., the aisles are stocked with freshly minted, enticing offerings. (Prepare yourself for pumpkin-spiced everything.) If you\u2019re not sure which to grab, we\u2019ve got you covered. Here are the newer items that we and other TJ\u2019s obsessives adore.\n\n(Prices are based on a Trader Joe\u2019s in Santa Monica, California, and may vary based on location.)\n\nEverything Ciabatta Rolls, $2.49\n\nPaul Schrodt More\n\nThere is perhaps no better vehicle for meats, cheeses, and vegetables at Trader Joe\u2019s than its brand-new Everything Ciabatta Rolls. These large and fluffy buns utilize a Trader Joe\u2019s secret weapon: Any true TJ\u2019s fan knows the power of its Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend. The same flavors are generously sprinkled on these rolls, which work just as well for ham-and-cheese sammies as for late-night peanut butter spread snacks.\n\nMac and Cheese Bites, $3.99\n\nPaul Schrodt More\n\nMacaroni and cheese is an iconic calorie bomb. Almost never terrible, yet always worth it. Trader Joe\u2019s has a robust history of high-quality frozen food options, and the frozen mac-and-cheese bites continue that trend. The breaded coating, which you should crisp up in a very hot oven, somehow even improves the gooeyness of elbow macaroni pasta and gouda cheese. And at 190 calories for three indulgent pieces per serving (the entire package comes with 10 bites), you don\u2019t have to feel gross if you decide not to make it a full meal. (Although if you do, no judgment.)\n\nClassic English Muffins, $1.49\n\nPaul Schrodt More", "description": "That pimento cheese dip though...", "authors": ["Paul Schrodt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6RtjhAf_qNCF1iV13wlSxg--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/7be3429284816e63d71f0cdb23f47947", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
