I was trapped on the roof with the daylight dwindling and my meal about to be ruined.\n\nI called my super. No answer. I banged desperately on the door. No response.\n\nPanicking, I called the only person I knew nearby: the wonderful woman who runs the laundromat next door. She was moments from closing for the night when she answered the phone.\n\nAfter we had clumsily navigated a bit of a language barrier, she walked outside, caught my keys when I threw them down and disappeared into my building.", "description": "A small problem on a warm Saturday evening, riding the M104 and more reader tales of New York City in this week\u2019s Metropolitan Diary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/nyregion/08diary-4/08diary-4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
