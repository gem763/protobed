Lindsey Graham. | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress Lindsey Graham to Trump: 'The Iranians are your target audience, not me'\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham has become one of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest allies since trashing his candidacy in 2016. But he\u2019s sticking with his criticism of Trump\u2019s approach on Iran.\n\nAfter Trump chastised him this week on Twitter and in comments to reporters for advocating a hardline approach and military strikes on Iran in retribution for an attack on Saudi Arabia, Graham (R-S.C.) stood firm on his opinion that the president and his administration is being too soft on Iran. And he thought little of the new sanctions Trump announced on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSanctions so far haven\u2019t worked and I doubt they ever will. So I think an appropriate military response is in order,\" Graham told a pair of reporters on Wednesday afternoon. The \u201cmeasured response to the drone attack, I appreciated that, I was hoping that would give everybody a chance to reset. So clearly the Iranians have taken that to be a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s tweet rebuking him, Graham replied: \u201cAll I can say is it\u2019s not working. The Iranians are your target audience, not me. And the Iranians decision to attack the Saudi oil field is an act of war by any definition.\u201d\n\nTrump has shrugged off suggestions by Graham and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) to strike Iran in retaliation for its incursions in the Middle East and even sacked his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton. And the beef between Graham and Trump lingered into Wednesday afternoon, with Trump saying his reluctance to strike back after Iran allegedly bombed Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production facilities is a \u201cgreat sign of strength.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

So we have a disagreement on that. And you know there's plenty of time to do some dastardly things,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe episode marks a rare schism between Graham, who famously did all he could to stop Trump\u2019s rise during the 2016 primary and then shifted gears to become a golfing buddy and close adviser to the president. The two have worked closely over the past two years, though Graham has occasionally advocated a more muscular military approach than Trump is comfortable with.\n\nGraham said on this issue the president knows where he stands, and warned that stalling any further could open up the Middle East to more attacks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly not going to stop until they pay a heavier price,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe Iranians decision to attack the Saudi oil field is an act of war by any definition. Pompeo said so.
