Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Mr. Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two American officials with knowledge of the call.\n\nThe White House curbed access to a transcript of the call \u2014 which the president made at Mr. Barr\u2019s request \u2014 to a small group of aides, one of the officials said. The restriction was unusual and similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Like that call, Mr. Trump\u2019s discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests .\n\nThe discussion with Mr. Morrison also shows the extent to which Mr. Trump views the attorney general as a critical partner. The president is using federal law enforcement powers to aid his political prospects, settle scores with his perceived \u201cdeep state\u201d enemies and show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt, partisan origins.\n\nThe Justice Department inquiry and a parallel but unconnected effort by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani represent a kind of two-front war. Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Barr can help him validate his 2016 electoral victory and seems eager for Mr. Giuliani to help him in 2020 by trying to unearth damaging information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.", "description": "The discussion was another instance of the president using American diplomacy for potential personal gain.", "authors": ["Mark Mazzetti", "Katie Benner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/politics/30dc-barr/30dc-barr-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
