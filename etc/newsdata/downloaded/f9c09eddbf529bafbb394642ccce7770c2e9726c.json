Its author, New Yorker staff writer Andrew Marantz, argued that \u201chate speech\u201d leads to violence. Worse, he claims it can cause totalitarianism and even genocide.\n\nTo avoid this fate, Marantz says we must rethink the First Amendment, which would include government and private companies striving to limit \u201chate speech.\u201d He agrees with a former American Civil Liberties Union official that one day in the not-so-distant future, legal \u201cprotection of hate speech\u201d will \u201cseem ridiculous in retrospect.\u201d\n\nBOZELL AND GRAHAM: LIBERALS AND BANNED BOOKS -- WHAT'S 'HATE SPEECH' AND WHO DECIDES?\n\nSome governments have already tried to outlaw \u201chate speech.\u201d The United Kingdom, for example, criminalizes it. Nevertheless, violent anti-Semitic hate crimes are 13 times more likely to occur there than in the U.S. France also criminalizes anti-Semitic speech. And yet violent anti-Semitic hate crimes are four times more likely to occur in France than in the U.S.\n\nEven Human Rights Watch admits that \u201ca careful review of the experience of many other countries \u2026 has made clear that there is little connection in practice between draconian hate speech laws and the lessoning of ethnic and racial violence or tension.\u201d\n\nBy asserting that hate speech leads to mass violence, the left hopes to persuade Americans to relinquish their right to free speech. To make that more palatable, they insist that freedom of speech is merely a \u201cvalue,\u201d instead of a right.\n\nA value is something perishable: today we hold one value, but as the times change, we may hold another one. For instance, nearly all of America valued traditional marriage just 10 years ago, yet today many value same-sex marriage. Values are determined by public opinion \u2014 or, perhaps more precisely, by elites who inform, not to say manipulate, it.\n\nRights, to the contrary, are non-negotiable; they belong to each individual by nature; societies are created for their protection. Speech is an inalienable right because it is the expression of thought, and our minds belong to us by nature. Rights, in other words, should determine the horizon of public opinion, not the other way around.\n\nBut, Marantz tells us, freedom of speech is merely a value, and \"like all values, it must be held in tension with others, such as equality, safety and robust democratic participation.\"\n\nNote the other \u201cvalues\u201d identified here. This is no random wish list. It\u2019s a short, cryptic summary of the genuine aims that many restriction advocates seek to achieve, of which \u201cequality\u201d is the key.\n\nEquality once meant that all human beings have the same rights as all other citizens \u2014 like voting rights, property rights, or speech rights. Today, by contrast, many restriction advocates understand equality to mean psychological equality or equal self-respect.\n\nSince the so-called dominant groups in American society already have enough self-respect or \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d the allegedly oppressed minority groups must be enabled to liberate themselves from oppression, find their identities, and assert their self-respect.\n\nCensorship advocates believe that free speech inhibits their liberation, both preventing these identities from coming into being, and harming them once they do. This is what it means to equate speech with violence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSociety, in the censors\u2019 view, must be devoted to preventing oppressed groups from feelings of contempt \u2014 even if such feelings arise from rational, fact-based criticism. Only celebration of these groups can guarantee full inclusion.\n\nBut this new speech paradigm is a one-way street: allegedly oppressed groups not only should be able to speak freely and critically about the dominant group; their liberation depends on such antagonistic speech.\n\nAs censorship advocate Mari Matsuda has written, \u201cExpressions of hatred, revulsion, and anger directed against historically dominant-group members by subordinate-group members\u201d should not be banned. In fact, \u201chate speech that comes from an experience of oppression\u201d should be tolerated. Outlawing hate speech, in effect, creates more hate speech \u2014 just of the right kind.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course we should be civil with our fellow citizens. But taking away fundamental rights from a free people cannot be done without consequences.\n\nSpeech criminalization has not worked well in Europe: there, \u201chate speech\u201d laws not only fail to achieve their explicit goals, but they have helped bring about the rule of petty, bureaucratic tyrants who chill speech, on the one hand, and have ushered in explosive, rebellious politics, on the other.\n\nWhy would the Times lend its pages to the cause of suppressing free speech? Perhaps it feels that in a nation where the dominant group rejects its progressive views on topics like immigration, criminality, and the health of the family, the Times would be in a better position to rule public discussions and set society\u2019s tone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ARTHUR MILIKH", "description": "By asserting that hate speech leads to mass violence, the left hopes to persuade Americans to relinquish their right to free speech.", "authors": ["Arthur Milikh", "Arthur Milikh Is The Associate Director Of The Heritage Foundation S B.
