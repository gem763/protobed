It\u2019s a lot,\u201d the 43-year-old Woods said of his 82nd official PGA Tour victory. His first came 23 years ago this month in Las Vegas, when he was 20.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week, five days at the top of the board is a long time. It was definitely stressful,\u201d said Woods, who pocketed a cheque for \u00a31.755 million.\n\nWoods led from gun to tape in the inaugural US PGA Tour event in Japan, which saw Friday\u2019s play washed out by the fringes of a typhoon that dumped almost 10 inches (25cm) of rain on the course 50 miles (80km) from Tokyo, forcing play into an extra day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about consistency and doing it for a long period of time,\u201d Woods said of tying Snead, who died in 2002 four days before his 90th birthday.\n\n\u201cSam did it into his fifties and I\u2019m in my early to mid-forties. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to have had the career I\u2019ve had so far.\u201d\n\nUS PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan was watching at home in the US. \u201cIt was just one of those \u2018wow\u2019 moments,\u201d he told AFP by telephone.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t fancy ties too much. So he\u2019s already on to: \u2018How do I get to 83?\u2019\u201d\n\nWoods said it was \u201ccool\u201d that, with the addition of his latest title in Japan, he had now won US PGA Tour events in seven different countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a global player, I\u2019ve always played all around the world and to tie the record outside the United States is pretty cool,\u201d Woods told reporters.\n\nWoods resumed his final round, suspended due to darkness on Sunday, at 7:30 am on the long par-12th but saw his overnight three-shot cushion over Matsuyama immediately cut to two.\n\nMatsuyama inexplicably spurned an easy opportunity to reduce the deficit to one as he missed a four-foot birdie putt on 14, but Woods made no mistake on the same green from 20 feet.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Pretty special\u2019 \u2013\n\nWoods missed a further birdie chance, from 10 feet, at the 15th and was watching from the 16th tee 181 yards away as Matsuyama walked in a 20-footer to get to 16-under.\n\nMatsuyama kept up the pressure but on the final hole his bunker shot flew past the flag and when he missed the long putt back his brave challenge ended at 16-under for the tournament after a final-round 67.\n\n\u201cThis was big,\u201d said a smiling Woods. \u201cHideki made it tight. It was a lot closer than what people probably thought.\n\n\u201cIt was a very long week because I was tied for the lead for the better part of five days. I made a mistake right away at 11 and it became a pretty good ball game.\u201d\n\nPlaying partner Gary Woodland said he had been privileged to have a front-row seat for the last two rounds as Woods played \u201cunbelievable\u201d golf.\n\n\u201cObviously the majors speak for themselves, but 82\u2019s just a crazy number,\u201d said the 35-year-old US Open champion who himself has won four times on the PGA Tour.\n\n\u201cYou look at the guys that have won 10 times and it\u2019s pretty special, let alone to come out here and win 82 times.\n\n\u201cTo battle through the injuries he\u2019s dealt with, gosh, he\u2019s young and he\u2019s playing unbelievable.\n\n\u201cThe ball-striking exhibition I\u2019ve seen the last two days is a joke. So I don\u2019t see him stopping anytime soon. Eighty-two\u2019s pretty special. I think there\u2019s a lot more in store.\u201d\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy finished birdie-birdie for a 67 and a share of third place on 13-under par with South Korea\u2019s PGA Tour Rookie of the Year Im Sung-jae who carded a fine five-under 65.", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods made golf history Monday when he won the Zozo Championship in Japan for his 82nd US PGA Tour victory \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/f40f92_tiger-woods-beneath-giant-82-winning-zozo-championship-in-japan-tying-sam-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
