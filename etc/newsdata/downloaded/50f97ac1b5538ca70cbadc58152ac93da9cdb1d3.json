'And the first chapter, not the only one, but the first chapter of political hatred is anti-Semitism.'\n\n'This must make us worry, and it should wake us up.'\n\nRiccardi said the trend can be countered by keeping alive the memory of the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million European Jews, creating solidarity between the Jewish and Christian communities in daily life, and investing in a common culture.\n\nA visitor wears a traditional jewish kippah as he enters Germany's lower house of parliament Bundestag in Berlin\n\n'Anti-Semitism is like a storm, at a certain point it explodes. We need to act at the first signs,' he said.\n\nThe Moshe Rosen award was named for the late chief rabbi of Romania who safeguarded his community during communism.\n\nThe first recipient two years ago was former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and last year the award went to Lithuanian novelist, Ruta Vanagaite, for her work challenging conventional thinking in a book about her country's involvement in the Nazi killing machine that exterminated 95% of the Jewish population.", "description": "Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmit gave the warning at the Conference of European Rabbis in Rome on Thursday just two weeks after an attack on a synagogue in Halle, Germany.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/19/20146590-0-image-a-20_1571940558799.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
