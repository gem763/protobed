By noon on a recent Thursday, local time, Dluginski had received six requests to retrieve AirPods \u2014 out of a total of 18 lost item reports filed at that time.\n\nDluginski told the newspaper he thinks the humidity and heat are partially to blame, as commuters\u2019 hands and ears get especially sweaty in the subway platforms.\n\nWhen transit workers are dispatched to retrieve single AirPods, (which cost $99 for a replacement) they often use an eight-foot extending pole with a clamp, which Dluginski called the \u201cpicker-upper thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tiny. They\u2019re hard to find,\u201d Dluginski, told WSJ, \u201cthe only saving grace is that they\u2019re white.\u201d\n\nSome riders take matters into their own hands and construct makeshift picker-upper things. These independent efforts to rescue AirPods can be dangerous and potentially cause train delays.\n\nIn July commuter Ashley Mayer lost one of her AirPods to the tracks and decided to save it using a broom and duct tape. Her documentation of the quest went viral.\n\nHe\u2019s filthy but he\u2019s mine (again)! ???? pic.twitter.com/RXGuzTBGke \u2014 Ashley Mayer (@ashleymayer) July 11, 2019\n\nMayer tweeted that she originally asked to have MTA workers rescue the earbud but was told it would take two hours and she would have to remain in the station. Presumably, MTA workers have more pressing matters than saving rogue AirPods.\n\nGizmodo science writer Ryan Mandelbaum, a real New Yawka, who has been riding the subway their entire life, commiserates with the subway workers who have to retrieve AirPods daily. \u201cGod bless da goils and boys in blue keepin MY CITY safe from da evil millenniums droppin e-pods all ova my subway,\u201d Mandelbaum said, adding. \u201cRot in rat hell, Bill Da Blasio.
