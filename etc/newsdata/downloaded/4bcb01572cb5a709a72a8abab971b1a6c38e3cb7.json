REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nThe U.S. social media giant\u2019s Libra project is the most well-known of the stablecoins, a certain form of cryptocurrency backed by assets such as traditional money deposits, short-term government securities or gold.\n\nIn its blockchain strategy passed by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cabinet on Wednesday, the government says it wants to boost the digital transformation of its economy but also tackle the risks stemming from such new technologies.\n\n\u201cWe want to be at the forefront and further strengthen Germany as a leading technology location,\u201d Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said, adding that blockchain technology could contribute to this as it was a building block of the future Internet.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we must protect consumers and state sovereignty,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cA core element of state sovereignty is the issuing of a currency, we will not leave this task to private companies.\u201d\n\nThe German government aims to liaise closely with its European and international allies to prevent stablecoins from becoming alternative currencies, according to the blockchain strategy passed by cabinet.\n\nBerlin will intensify its existing dialogue with the Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s national central bank, about digital central bank money in order to explore the current state of developments and address possible risks, it said.\n\nELECTRONIC BONDS\n\nThe German government also aims to propose legislation this year which would allow the introduction of blockchain-based electronic bonds, the document showed.\n\nFrance and Germany said on Friday that Facebook\u2019s Libra currency poses risks to the financial sector that could block its authorisation in Europe. They also backed the development of an alternative public cryptocurrency in Europe.\n\nThe criticism comes as the European Central Bank is working on a long-term plan to launch a public digital currency that could make projects such as Libra redundant.\n\nOn Tuesday, ECB board member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said stablecoins like Facebook\u2019s Libra highlighted gaps in rules, adding that the media giant\u2019s payments project faced a tough regulatory approach.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Libra is in close contact with European regulators such as Germany\u2019s financial markets watchdog Bafin to sound out regulatory hurdles.\n\n\u201cWe are in intensive discussions with Libra,\u201d Bafin president Felix Hufeld told reporters last week, adding that some complicated questions still had to be addressed.\n\n\u201cWe have asked questions, we have received responses. Very specific questions, less detailed answers,\u201d Hufeld said.\n\nThis showed that many questions of high economic relevance had not been thought through completely yet by the Libra people themselves, Hufeld added.", "description": "Germany has passed a comprehensive blockchain strategy in which Berlin vows to fight any company efforts to establish a parallel currency, in the latest sign that Facebook's planned Libra faces tough regulatory hurdles in Europe.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431153850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0KF", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
