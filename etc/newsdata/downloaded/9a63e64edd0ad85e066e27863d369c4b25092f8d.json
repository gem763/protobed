REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\nThat Trudeau was Pierre, who came to power in 1968 and then almost lost in 1972.\n\nFast forward nearly 50 years and his son Justin is in an eerily similar situation: The once-popular Liberal prime minister is now in trouble ahead of an Oct. 21 election.\n\nThe elder Trudeau, a flamboyant, stylish politician, won a landslide victory in 1968. His public appearances triggered screaming crowds and the birth of the phrase \u201cTrudeaumania.\u201d\n\nYet four years later in 1972, at the end of an election campaign widely mocked as one of the worst in Canadian history, he hung onto office by the narrowest of margins and had to form a pact with the rival left-leaning New Democrats to keep governing.\n\nJustin Trudeau, 47, who won power in 2015 by promising \u201cSunny Ways\u201d but is now trying to shake off images of himself in blackface years ago, also set off a wave of Trudeaumania internationally. He too appears headed for a minority government and analysts predict he will need the support of the New Democrats to govern.\n\n\u201cThe resemblance is in the disappointment with Trudeau senior and now Trudeau junior,\u201d said University of Toronto professor Robert Bothwell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkably similar because of the magnetism both of them showed in their initial campaigns.\u201d\n\nBoth prime ministers had trouble with the occupant of the White House. U.S. President Donald Trump last year slammed Justin Trudeau as weak and dishonest, almost 50 years after Richard Nixon used an epithet to describe Pierre Trudeau.\n\nThe Trudeaumania of 1968 faded and by 1972 the best slogan the Liberals could come up with was \u201cThe Land is Strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody knew what the hell that meant,\u201d said Bothwell. \u201cPeople were just not moved.\u201d\n\nJustin Trudeau is campaigning under the message of \u201cChoose Forward,\u201d which is not grammatical in English.\n\nPolls show the Liberals locked in a tie with the main opposition Conservative Party and unable to break away.\n\nIMPERFECT PARALLELS\n\nBothwell and other historians who lived through the earlier campaign say there are limits to the comparisons. For one, Pierre Trudeau\u2019s Liberals showed a degree of arrogance that the modern party has long since lost.\n\n\u201cThe 1972 election was widely interpreted as one where the Liberals were chastised for being overly complacent and possessing in their minds a divine right of governance,\u201d said Allan Tupper, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.\n\nPierre Trudeau \u201cjust wasn\u2019t engaging in the political cut and thrust\u201d of the 1972 campaign, said University of Manitoba history professor Barry Ferguson, noting his son had put much more effort into his bid for re-election.\n\nAlso in 1972, Conservative leader Robert Stanfield and New Democratic Party chief David Lewis were experienced politicians with a history of achievements.\n\nTheir counterparts today - Andrew Scheer of the Conservatives and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democrats - are younger and with much lighter resumes.\n\n\u201cI can see why people say there are parallels, but the capacities of the political leaders were different,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nA Liberal spokeswoman, asked whether the campaign saw any similarities with the events of 1972, said Trudeau was focused on moving forward.\n\nIn the 1972 election, Pierre Trudeau won by just two seats.\n\nBut the elder Trudeau, who died in 2000 at age 80, was able to rebound politically after his election scare. He won a parliamentary majority in 1974 and stayed in power for most of the next decade.\n\nJustin Trudeau is forecast to win at best 160 of 338 seats, falling short of an effective majority.", "description": "A Canadian Liberal prime minister with the surname name Trudeau takes office amid huge public enthusiasm, attracts global admiration, clashes with an unpredictable U.S. president and then struggles in the next election.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439271245&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF99190-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
