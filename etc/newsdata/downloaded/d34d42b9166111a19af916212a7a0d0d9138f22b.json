Add Interest\n\n\"We're trying to find out about a whistleblower,\" Trump said, as he was walking out of the Oval Office after a swearing-in ceremony for new Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia.\n\nThe president's comments came as Andrew Bakaj, a lawyer for the whistleblower, tweeted, \"The Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.\"\n\nThe president also continued his attacks on House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and the whistleblower, and called Schiff's opening statement, in which he made dramatic embellishments to the transcript a call between Trump and the President of Ukraine, \"horrible\" and a \"disgrace.\"\n\n\"The call was perfect. When the whistleblower reported it, he made it sound terrible. And then you had Adam Schiff who, even worse, made up my words. Which I think is just horrible, I have never seen a thing like that,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said Schiff added to his transcript because \"it was so good that he couldn't quote from it because there was nothing done wrong.\" But the president and White House have still not pinpointed what in the whistleblower's complaint about the call was inaccurate.\n\nOn Monday, the president ramped up his attempts to discredit the Ukraine call whistleblower saying that the person \"knew almost nothing.\"\n\nSusan Walsh/AP, FILE\n\n\"The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up,\" Trump tweeted. \"It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress & the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!\"\n\nTrump's latest attack comes a day after he claimed on Twitter that in the complaint, the whistleblower had represented his conversation with the Ukranian president in \u201ca totally inaccurate and fraudulent way.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday.\n\nLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\n\"I want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower, who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that's close to a spy,\" Trump said during a private event in New York. \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nTrump also got backlash from GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger for tweeting out a paraphrase of Pastor Robert Jeffress on \"Fox and Friends\" Sunday he feared that if the president is successfully removed from office that it will result in a \u201cCivil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted. \u201c@realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President.
