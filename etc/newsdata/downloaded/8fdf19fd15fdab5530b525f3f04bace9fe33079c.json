They sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d an ersatz national anthem (coz we aren\u2019t a national and haven\u2019t the right to an anthem). People ask what Communist China is most afraid of\u2014the answer is right here. pic.twitter.com/GqybB9fgqs \u2014 Jason Y. Ng (@jasonyng) September 9, 2019 Report\n\nAnother video showed protesters chanting \"Go Hong Kong\" - a phrase that has been used frequently as a sign of encouragement.\n\nShopping malls have been the scene of clashes in recent weeks, with one incident in July seeing riot police fight battles with protesters inside a mall in the district of Sha Tin.\n\nBut the recent events have played out peacefully.\n\nGlory to Hong Kong was written by a local musician in response to calls for an anthem for protesters.\n\nThe lyrics include lines such as \"Do you feel the rage in our cries? Rise up and speak up\" and \"persevere, for we are as one\".\n\nThe new rallying cry has joined other popular songs used by the protest movement, including Do You Hear the People Sing? from musical Les Miserables and the Christian hymn Sing Hallelujah to the Lord.\n\nIt was also heard at the China v Iran football match on Tuesday at Hong Kong Stadium.\n\nThe 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifier saw thousands of protesting booing when the Chinese national anthem played before the start of the game.\n\nThe jeering, which could be heard from outside the stadium, was intended as a clear \"message\" to Beijing that they do not want to be part of China in the future, says the BBC's Nick Beake who was at the game.\n\nIt's not the first time people in Hong Kong have been heard booing the Chinese anthem - though it is not clear how long they might be able to do this.\n\nIn 2017 China passed a law making it illegal to disrespect the anthem, but the law has yet to be passed in Hong Kong.\n\n'Too little, too late'\n\nHong Kong, formerly a British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nUnder the \"one country, two systems\" rule, the city is granted a high level of autonomy, an independent judiciary and rights such as freedom of speech.\n\nBut those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.\n\nThere has been growing anti-mainland sentiment in recent years, and anger at what many feel is increasing mainland interference in Hong Kong affairs.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters sang the US anthem outside the consulate\n\nThis reached a tipping point when the Hong Kong parliament proposed a new law that would have enabled suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to China.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people marched on the streets in protest of the law, demanding that it be abandoned. The government initially suspended in June, and then finally dropped earlier this week - almost three months after protests first begun.\n\nBut protesters have said this is \"too little, too late\", and their demands have evolved into calls for a much wider set of reforms, including a call for universal suffrage.", "description": "A football match saw the Chinese anthem booed while singing protests took over shopping malls.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DE0C/production/_108744865_gettyimages-1167240158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
