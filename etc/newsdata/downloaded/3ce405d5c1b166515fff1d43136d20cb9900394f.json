They are targeting investors who are dissatisfied with Groupon\u2019s strategy of boosting its valuation by growing subscriptions.\n\nGroupon\u2019s stock closed at $2.49 each on Thursday, down about 22% this year and far below the company\u2019s all-time high of $26.19 on Nov. 18, 2011, about two weeks after it went public, according to data provider FactSet. At the time of its initial public offering, Groupon was valued at $16.5 billion. Today, its market value is about $1.4 billion.\n\nGroupon\u2019s financials have weakened in recent quarters and the business lost its finance chief last week.\n\n\u201cIt is time to do something more impactful,\u201d said Robert Chapman, founder of California investment firm Chapman Capital LLC, which once pursued activist campaigns against U.S. businesses but now manages his family\u2019s assets.\n\nChapman Capital has been building a Groupon stake in recent weeks and now holds about 10 million shares, or about 1.5% of the company\u2019s stock, Mr. Chapman said. He is trying to band together shareholders to pressure Groupon management to sell the company or, at least, buy back $100 million worth of shares, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are coming around to my view,\u201d said Mr. Chapman, who added that he didn\u2019t want to lead the campaign beyond building support for his proposals. Mr. Chapman said he is still waiting for responses from the shareholders he has approached.\n\nTwo other people familiar with Groupon\u2019s situation confirmed outreach by activist investors to existing Groupon shareholders. One person acknowledged being contacted by at least three activists. Another described interactions with a fourth.\n\nSome Groupon shareholders are open to an activist campaign, these people said. Talks have been preliminary and no agreements have been reached, they said.\n\nThe average trading volume of Groupon\u2019s stock has risen to a daily average of about 6.5 million shares during the past five days, up about 30% from the 90-day average, according to FactSet.\n\nGroupon Chief Executive Richard Williams remains \u201cactively engaged\u201d with its shareholder base, the company said in a statement. Last year, he indicated on an earnings call that the company had received interest from possible buyers, but he didn\u2019t identify potential suitors.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to having an open dialogue with all of our shareholders,\u201d a Groupon spokesperson said Thursday. \u201cHowever, we do not comment on rumor, speculation or hypothetical situations.\u201d\n\nGroupon, which connects consumers with local merchants by offering discounts on goods, services and activities, has fallen out of favor with investors because its service is having difficulty resonating with users, analysts said.\n\nThe once fast-growing startup expanded to hundreds of cities around the globe before shifting its focus to local commerce and higher-value customers. It recently launched a monthly subscription offer called Groupon Select aimed at generating more recurring revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price has plunged by about 38% since Mr. Williams became chief executive in November 2015, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cSelling the company would probably be the best outcome,\u201d Mr. Chapman said, echoing a view shared by at least one other person familiar with Groupon\u2019s situation. New owners could help refocus the company and unlock growth opportunities and shareholder value, they said.\n\nGroupon\u2019s management has rejected offers in the past two years to take the company private, one of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nTom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co., thinks a combination between Groupon and other internet-focused businesses would make sense.\n\nIAC/InterActiveCorp , the New-York based media company, or Booking Holdings Inc., the company behind hotel search site Priceline.com, could be logical bidders for Groupon, Mr. Forte said Thursday. He also suggested a scenario that included the additional acquisition of review company Yelp Inc. \u201cI see a strategic logic in either of these combinations,\u201d he said.\n\nIAC\u2019s finance chief said this month that the company is targeting acquisitions. Joseph M. Levin, IAC\u2019s chief executive, recently left his board seat at Groupon. Mr. Levin declined to comment.\n\nBooking Holdings didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Yelp declined to comment.\n\nA strategic partnership with a complementary company also could be an option for Groupon, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nLacking a sale, an immediate share repurchase of $100 million or more would significantly drive up Groupon\u2019s share price, Mr. Chapman said.\n\nGroupon has bought back around $900 million of its own stock since August 2013, according to the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. The company spent $15 million in the second quarter to buy back 4.2 million shares, leaving it with a remaining share repurchase authorization of $260 million, according to Groupon\u2019s most recent earnings call. It had $597 million in cash at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe company last month reported falling profit and revenue for the second quarter as a result of fewer customers and lower traffic on its site. Gross profit was $292.1 million in the second quarter, down 9.7% from the prior-year quarter, while revenue fell 13.7% to $532.6 million.\n\n\u201cAn activist could come in and encourage the company to divest its international holdings and use every dollar to buy back shares,\u201d said Mr. Forte, the Davidson analyst. \u201cDepending on the activist investor, they could also press for a management change.\u201d\n\nNews of the activist interest comes on the heels of the resignation of Groupon\u2019s chief financial officer, Michael Randolfi, who left the company last week to become CFO of Adtalem Global Education Inc., a provider of educational services. Mr. Randolfi didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Groupon investors and a few outsiders\u2014including several activist groups\u2014are targeting shareholders who are dissatisfied with Groupon\u2019s strategy of boosting its valuation by growing subscriptions.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102675/social"}
