It's an epic scene of human struggle and natural terror that dwarfs the sacred Mount Fuji just behind it.\n\nThis is \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa,\" a woodblock print by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai and one of the world's most iconic pieces of Asian art.\n\nIf this climactic moment seems ubiquitous -- think T-shirts, coffee mugs, laptop decals -- that's because it was designed to be.\n\nA visitor looks at Katsushika Hokusai's famous print, \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa,\" at the Ara Pacis Museum in Rome.

As many as 5,000 impressions were made from the original woodblocks for \"The Great Wave.\" Back then, the prints were sold for the price of a bowl of noodles.\n\nThe artisans keeping Japan's woodblock print tradition alive\n\nBy the time \"The Great Wave\" made its debut, in around 1830, Japan was flirting with the idea of ending more than 200 years of isolationism. The story of growing foreign influence is evident in Hokusai's masterpiece -- the rich shade of blue used in the prints was imported from Europe. Prussian blue, as it's commonly known, was a synthetic color created in the 18th century and prized for its depth and durability.\n\nThat Hokusai employed the hue as the principal actor in his oceanic drama suggests that he was depicting Japan on the cusp of change. As much as the wave portends instability and danger, it also suggests possibility and adventure.\n\n'Essence' of Japan\n\nHokusai spent most of his life in the riverside district of Sumida, Tokyo, where he adopted at least 30 pseudonyms and, perhaps, just as many different styles. \"The Great Wave\" was the first in his series \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji,\" a virtuosic study of Japan's highest and most revered mountain.\n\n\"Many people view the painting as the very essence of Japanese culture,\" says Atsuko Okuda, chief curator of the Sumida Hokusai Museum in Japan. \"The simple and powerful composition of the mountain and the shape of the wave strikes right at the heart of the observer.\"\n\nObservers famously included French Impressionists Edgar Degas and Claude Monet, as well as Dutch master Vincent van Gogh, who was enamored with \"The Great Wave.\" They were not alone: In the 1860s, the proliferation of ukiyo-e in Europe led to an artistic fascination with Japan in the West, known as \"Japonisme.\"\n\nThe bold colors and outlines found in Van Gogh's \"Courtesan (after Eisen)\" shows the influence of Japanese woodblock prints.

This piece alone requires a black outline, various blues for the water, and shades of yellow and pink for the sky.\n\nThe process is painstaking and demands utmost precision. Takahashi says it takes about a decade to become a true ukiyo-e \"shokunin,\" or master craftsman, and that there are only 25 left in Tokyo today.\n\n\"We have to succeed in passing down this wonderful technique of ukiyo-e woodblock prints,\" she says. \"The craftsmen involved in this work are trying their best to teach these skills to the next generation.\"", "description": "If Hokusai's dramatic woodblock print seems ubiquitous, that's because it was designed to be.", "authors": ["Dan Tham", "Junko Ogura"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181101171305-katsushika-hokusai-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-03"}
