However, Gauff broke back and won the last six points of the tiebreaker to set up a meeting with Kateryna Kozlova of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t looked too far ahead in the draw. I\u2019m just going to keep playing my game and having fun,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cToday was my lucky day, so I hope I continue to take that luck into whenever I play my second round.\u201d\n\nThe biggest upset of the day was German qualifier Anna-Lena Friedsam beating second-seeded Belinda Bencic of Switzerland, ousting the U.S. Open semifinalist 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.\n\nFifth-seeded Julia Goerges advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Margarita Gasparyan and No. 4 Donna Vekic cruised past Polona Hercog 6-1, 6-1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coco Gauff took full advantage of a \"lucky loser\" spot at the Upper Austria Ladies, beating Swiss qualifier Stefanie Voegele, 6-3, 7-6 (3) Tuesday to reach the second round at the indoor tournament.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
