But GOP lawmakers claim the calls from Democratic presidential candidates for his impeachment speak to a bigger issue.\n\nAs part of their defense of Kavanaugh, they say the renewed campaign against President Trump's second Supreme Court pick is part of an escalating series of attacks on judicial independence -- citing recent warnings to the high court and calls for 'court-packing' in addition to the pressure on Kavanaugh.\n\n2020 DEMOCRATS IGNORE KAVANAUGH STORY CORRECTION AFTER DEMANDING IMPEACHMENT\n\n\u201cThis is not normal political behavior,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said earlier this week on the Senate floor.\n\nThe calls for Kavanaugh's ouster followed a New York Times report on sexual misconduct allegations. But the report was called into question after the newspaper revised its original story to note the apparent victim in the newly alleged incident did not recall it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attack on judicial independence,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, in response to the Kavanaugh controversy. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to intimidate, to bully and to threaten the justices because they\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll help advance and protect this liberal agenda that they\u2019re trying to get through the courts, when they know it\u2019s being rejected by the American people.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh's most vocal critics, though, say the latest allegation -- that he had his pants down at a dorm party \"where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student\" -- is one of several that merit deeper investigation. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a presidential candidate, tweeted, \"The reality of Kavanaugh's confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity \u2014 there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.\"\n\nWhile top Democratic leaders have pushed back on the impeachment calls and suggested it's not part of their agenda right now, the campaign against Kavanaugh is not over. Liberal activist organizations Demand Justice, the Center for Popular Democracy and the Women\u2019s March are planning protests on Oct. 6, the anniversary of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cMy Republican colleagues and I will fight to preserve a fair and independent judiciary,\u201d McConnell tweeted.\n\nMcConnell is often vilified by Democrats for his own tactics regarding the judiciary -- namely, his role in preventing then-President Barack Obama\u2019s final nominee, Merrick Garland, from being considered in the Senate. Garland\u2019s nomination never received a hearing, or a confirmation vote, so when the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was still open after President Trump took office, Trump was able to name Neil Gorsuch instead.\n\nMcConnell claimed it was appropriate not to act on Garland\u2019s nomination because he believed the outgoing president should not get to select a Supreme Court justice during his final year in office. Democrats were livid earlier this year when McConnell said if the same situation came up during the final year of Trump\u2019s term, he would confirm the nominee. McConnell\u2019s communication director later said that the difference is that presently the White House and Senate are controlled by the same party, which was not the case with Obama.\n\nMcConnell, however, is not the only one blasting Democrats for recent actions. On Tuesday, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., accused Democrats and the media of \u201cleveraging unfounded criminal allegations against a duly confirmed Supreme Court Justice in an effort to undermine not only his work, but ultimately the entire court as an institution.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Democratic senators led by Rhode Island\u2019s Sheldon Whitehouse filed a brief accusing the Supreme Court of being \u201cnot well,\u201d and essentially threatened that if the justices don\u2019t \u201cheal\u201d themselves, they could be \u201crestructured,\u201d which was believed to be a reference to court-packing. Several Democratic presidential candidates have supported this concept of expanding the roster of the Supreme Court. Increasing the number of justices would allow the president to shift the balance on the bench by loading it up with justices of his or her preference.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., took the Democrats to task for the restructuring threat, saying that expanding the Supreme Court to make it more liberal has long been Democrats\u2019 \u201cDream.\u201d He vowed to \u201cdo everything in my power to ensure that dream is NEVER fulfilled.\u201d\n\nAll 53 Senate Republicans then signed a letter to the Supreme Court clerk warning the justices not to give in to Democratic pressure.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote that Whitehouse\u2019s brief and the current calls for impeaching Kavanaugh are part of an \u201cassault on the judiciary,\u201d inspired in part by an agenda including the Green New Deal, which could ultimately rely on court rulings.\n\nMembers of the court have largely remained silent on these issues, although liberal stalwart Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke out against expanding the court in a July conversation with NPR.\n\n\"Nine seems to be a good number,\" she said.", "description": "Conservatives\u00a0once more have rallied around\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as he faces a new round of disputed sexual misconduct allegations.
