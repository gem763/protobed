But we suspect that it won\u2019t be long before slower global growth, including in the U.S., takes a toll on both,\u201d said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics, in a Friday note.\n\nStocks gained ground over the past week, with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.39% putting in a 0.5% advance, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.83% saw a 0.4% weekly rise, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95% slipped 0.2%. That left the S&P 500 1.3% away from its all-time closing high set in July.\n\nOil, meanwhile, retreated, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLX19, -0.43% falling 1.7% over the past week, dragging the U.S. benchmark lower on the month and leaving it more than 23% off its 2019 high and down nearly 30% from its October 2018 high above $76 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over global economic growth might explain why oil has struggled in the wake of attacks on Saudi Arabian oil-processing facilities last month that temporarily knocked a whopping 5.7 million barrels of day of production offline. While the Saudis are believed to have restored output, that effort was seen depleting the world of much its spare production capacity. That means another disruption anywhere in the world could have a lasting impact on supply. The lack of a more meaningful oil price premium has confounded some market analysts.\n\nMeanwhile, signs of concern about global growth weren\u2019t hard to find. The International Monetary Fund on Oct. 16 updated its economic outlook, cutting its outlook for global economic growth to 3% this year \u2014 the slowest pace since dark days of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 as higher tariffs strangle manufacturing activity and international trade.\n\nInvestors have paid close attention to the ebb and flow of U.S.-China trade talks and other geopolitical concerns. U.S. stocks even got a temporary, knee-jerk lift on Thursday after U.K. and European Union negotiators announced a tentative agreement on Brexit terms.\n\n\u201cThe two dominant geopolitical stories \u2014 Brexit and U.S./Chinese trade \u2014 are still driving markets. Of the two, the U.S. move away from free trade is by far the more important,\u201d said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, in an Oct. 16 note.\n\nFor now, investors appear tentatively happy with recent signs of progress in U.S.-China talks, including the Trump administration\u2019s touting of a partial agreement with Beijing on Oct. 11. But the fight isn\u2019t yet resolved and the threat of further tariff increases remain. Meanwhile, U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods took effect Friday.\n\nAnd measures of trade-policy uncertainty are running high, with economists at IHS Markit estimating that the resulting anxiety has already lowered U.S. capital spending by $100 billion, or 0.5% of gross domestic product.\n\nGambarini at Capital Economics sees parallels with 2014-16 (see chart below), when crude prices fell around $80 a barrel due largely to rapid growth in U.S. shale output and the unwillingness of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to cut production. The S&P 500 continued to trend higher over that stretch, while overall credit spreads rose only slightly, despite signs of distress in the energy sector.\n\nCapital Economics\n\nThe wider stock market and corporate bonds did come under pressure, however, as worries about grew about demand in the face of a weakening Chinese economy. This time around lower oil prices have only been a drag on stocks and corporate bonds in the energy sector, with investors apparently banking on a swift recovery in the global economy, she said.\n\nInstead, Capital Economics, sees economic growth slowing further in the U.S. and remaining subdued elsewhere over the remainder of 2019, which means \u201cit is only a matter of time before other sectors falter as well,\u201d said Gambarini, who sees the S&P 500 ending 2019 at 2,500, down around 16% from its current level.\n\nEarnings season\n\nAnalysts also tied a stronger stock-market tone to a well-received start to earnings season. So far around 15% of S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter results. Of those, 84% reported a positive surprise on earnings, while 64% reported a positive revenue surprise, according to FactSet.\n\nResults, of course, typically surprise to the upside after companies steer down expectations. Still, the percentages of companies reporting earnings surprises and revenue surprises are above their respective five-year averages, according So far, the tally finds the S&P 500 is delivering a year-over-year decline in earnings of 4.7%, while revenues have grown 2.6%.\n\nThe coming week will see a continued stream of results, including third-quarter earnings on Wednesday from Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.25%, which is heavily exposed to China.\n\nEconomic calendar\n\nEuropean Central Bank policy makers gather Thursday for President Mario Draghi\u2019s last monetary policy meeting as president. Christine Lagarde, the former International Monetary Fund managing director, takes the helm on Nov. 1. The ECB isn\u2019t expected to make any big moves after delivering a controversial stimulus package in September, including pushing the deposit rate further into negative territory and resuming monthly bond purchases.\n\nOn the U.S. economic calendar, September existing home sales data is set for release on Tuesday. Weekly jobless claims, September durable goods orders, the Markit manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes for October and September new-home sales are all set for Thursday, while an October consumer-sentiment gauge is scheduled for Friday.", "description": "Oil prices might be acting like a warning light when it comes to the stock market, which is trading near all-time highs despite growing concern over the...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO053_warnin_ZG_20190724120652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
