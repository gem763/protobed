We have confidence in the judicial system and that the full facts will be presented in court,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nThe company and Wallis have been indicted on 10 counts of first degree assault, 10 counts of second degree assault, and five counts of third degree assault.\n\nIf convicted, Baker Hughes and its units could face fines totaling $2.5 million.
