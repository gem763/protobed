I understand what it takes to come back from it. It\u2019s been nice to have movement again and not having it catch and lock up.\u201d\n\nWoods, who had arthroscopic surgery two months ago, plays the made-for-television \u201cThe Challenge: Japan Skins\u201d event on Monday, and the Zozo Championship beginning on Thursday \u2014 the first full PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\nWoods will play with Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, and Hideki Matsuyama in the skins game at the Narashino Country Club, the same venue for Zozo Championship. The course is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of central Tokyo.\n\nThe course for next year\u2019s Olympics is located nearby at the Kasumigaseki Country Club.\n\nWoods said the knee troubled him all season, becoming more bothersome after he won the Masters in April.\n\n\u201cIt progressively got worse and got to where it was affecting even reading putts,\u201d Wood said. \u201cYou could see toward the end of the year I wasn\u2019t getting down on my putts well.\u201d\n\nWoods said he had the surgery, wanting to be ready for the two events this week in Japan, followed in December by the Hero Challenge, and the Presidents Cup in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice to be able to squat down and read putts and start going at it full speed again,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been wear-and-tear over the years. It\u2019s just been stressed out for a very long time.\u201d\n\nWoods repeated his interest in playing in next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. But he has work to do to qualify.\n\n\u201cIt would be an honor to represent my country in the Olympic Games,\u201d Wood said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m ninth in the world ranking and hopefully in the next year I can have a good year and qualify and represent my country.\u201d", "description": "INZAI CITY, Japan (AP) \u2014 Tiger Woods is returning from another surgical procedure on his left knee \u2014 his fifth on the same problem spot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo-Lee-Jin-man-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
