Tuesday\u2019s do-over election was called in February after the state election board found evidence of absentee-ballot fraud on behalf of the then-GOP candidate, pastor Mark Harris.\n\nMr. McCready, a 36-year-old solar entrepreneur, is taking another run at the seat, this time facing Republican Dan Bishop, a 55-year-old state senator who won a 10-way primary last spring after Mr. Harris decided not to participate in the redo. Polls show a dead heat between Mr. McCready and Mr. Bishop.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote is a test of how voters, particularly suburbanites who make up much of the district, view Mr. Trump as the 2020 campaign kicks into gear, people from both political parties said in interviews.\n\n\u201cThat is the top issue for most of the people we talk to,\u201d said Jim Blaine, a consultant for Mr. Bishop. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of the enthusiasm of both parties.\u201d\n\nMr. Bishop has campaigned almost exclusively on his allegiance to Mr. Trump, making the president\u2019s endorsement a centerpiece in his ads and sharing the stage with Mr. Trump earlier this summer at a rally in Greenville, N.C., when the crowd chanted \u201cSend her back,\u201d about a member of Congress and U.S. citizen originally from Somalia.\n\n\u201cIf Bishop wins, it shows the health and continued strength of the Trump coalition,\u201d said Mr. Blaine, describing the coalition as rural and populist voters in the eastern stretches of the district and core suburban Republicans.\n\nIf Mr. Bishop loses, he said, it will be a sign that a winning Democratic strategy in a red or swing state is to run as a centrist and at a distance from the progressive wing of the national party.\n\nCarolyn Eberly, founder of the grass-roots group Indivisible NC District 9, also said the race was about Mr. Trump. She said her group was formed to \u201cresist the current administration\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nShe said she has worn a McCready shirt as she knocked on doors for 10 out of the past 11 days in the GOP strongholds of southern Mecklenburg County and Union County southeast of Charlotte. \u201cThere\u2019s so much energy out there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are still people that are not on board, but there are others who see me and are honking and cheering.\u201d\n\nMr. McCready rarely mentions the president by name on the stump, saying instead that people want a change in tone and a move from divisive rhetoric. He has campaigned as a moderate and a Marine Corps veteran, pledging to put country over party.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday told reporters he thought the race was \u201cgetting less close.\u201d Earlier, he tweeted his support for Mr. Bishop, saying, \u201cWe need him badly in Washington! His opponent is a far left Sanctuary Cities supporter.\u201d\n\nMr. McCready tweeted a response, saying, \u201cActually, there\u2019s one person in this race who has kept this country secure. I signed up after 9/11 to defend us in the Marines and fight the terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe Ninth District is concentrated in Charlotte\u2019s southern suburbs, which account for about 60% of the vote total. The district stretches three hours\u2019 drive east of Charlotte through several rural counties and includes part of the military town of Fayetteville, where Mr. Trump will hold Monday\u2019s rally.\n\nMr. McCready held his own rally with veterans in a downtown park in Fayetteville Monday, saying that in his platoon in the Iraq war, no one cared whether you were Republican or Democrat.\n\n\u201cWe put our country first,\u201c he said. \u201dThat\u2019s what this country\u2019s all about and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve forgotten up in Washington.\"\n\nMr. Trump is the reason the district is in play, according to David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Republicans are desperate to avoid a setback in a state critical to their 2020 prospects for holding the White House and taking back the House.\n\n\u201cThey badly need a morale boost at the moment,\u201d Mr. Wasserman said, after a dozen GOP House members announced their retirement in the past year. \u201cThis is their turf, they have to prove that they can hold their own ground.\u201d\n\nOutside groups have spent a near-record amount for a single special election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Groups like the national parties\u2019 congressional committees have spent $6.8 million to boost the Republican, and about $3.9 million to help the Democrat.\n\nBoth campaigns predict turnout to be relatively low and the result to come down to hundreds of votes, as it did in 2018.\n\nDemocrats outpaced Republicans in the first weeks of early voting, but Republicans have narrowed the gap and also tend to outvote Democrats on Election Day, said Donald Bryson, president of the conservative, Raleigh-based Civitas Institute.\n\nWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump is holding a rally Monday on behalf of a North Carolina congressional candidate as he goes all-in on a special election both parties see as a referendum on the man in the White House and a bellwether for his 2020 chances.", "authors": ["Valerie Bauerlein", "Valerie.Bauerlein Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105400/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
