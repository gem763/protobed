Now another group of activists, part of the Extinction Rebellion movement, are plotting how to push action on climate risks up the political agenda.\n\nThe movement, which began in Britain and is carrying out a two-week civil disobedience campaign in London, is rapidly expanding around the world, with a range of protests in more than 50 countries this month, organizers said.\n\nIn Boston, hundreds of people late last month blocked a bridge in the city's Seaport district to call attention to rising sea levels and to demand local and federal officials act on the \u201cclimate and ecological emergency\u201d.\n\nThe New England rebels have, for the most part, employed less disruptive measures than their counterparts in London, where more than 1,700 people have been arrested over the past two weeks for public disturbances, police say.\n\nThose have included everything from using a decommissioned fire engine bought on eBay to spray artificial \"blood\" on the national treasury to activists super-gluing themselves to infrastructure at London City Airport, including a plane.\n\nIn Boston, as in London, the protests have had their genesis in meetings like the one in the church basement, where people worried about climate threats have a chance to learn more about them - and then potentially get involved in activism.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re trying to do is be evocative and make an emotional connection\u201d to start a conversation on the impacts of climate change, said John Burkhardt, an outreach coordinator for the Boston branch.\n\nThose impacts can range from increasingly severe droughts to depletion of water resources or record-breaking temperatures, the 53-year-old software engineer told current and prospective members of the movement at the church.\n\nFor many - Burkhardt included - the emerging climate crisis has taken a personal toll.\n\nThe father of three said he suffers eco-related anxiety. He recalled how, when his 12-year-old son Iain was younger, the boy was completely engrossed with images of wildlife in the family encyclopedias.\n\n\u201cHe was just so curious and full of awe and wonder of this planet and this rich abundance of life, and I\u2019ve had to accept that he\u2019s not going to experience that\u201d as species extinctions accelerate in the face of climate change, Burkhardt said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an experience of loss for me. I\u2019m grieving for a future that I have to imagine for him.\u201d\n\nTwyla Wolfe, a psychologist who attended the talk, said she'd come after seeing more people develop depression and stress over their concerns about the environment.\n\n\u201cI would say in the last couple of months people have been talking more about (climate change) when they come in,\u201d the 38-year-old said.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that\u2019s really important to them, whether it\u2019s bringing up feelings of grief that they\u2019re kind of working through or helplessness or the anxiety of what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe jump in clients who have brought up climate worries has pushed climate change increasingly to the forefront of her own mind, she said.\n\nSo, taking the advice she often gives clients \u2014 to become involved in efforts to advocate for climate action, as a way to empower themselves \u2014 Wolfe found herself ready to join the frontlines of the emerging movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOCAL SENSIBILITIES\n\nMembers of the Massachusetts branch of Extinction Rebellion held their first large-scale protest in April, gathering in the lobby of the Boston Globe to demand the newspaper present climate threats \"with the urgency required\u201d, Burkhardt said.\n\nThen in June, members disrupted a natural gas forum in Boston, occupying a hotel lobby to protest the development of more fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nEleven of the participants were arrested.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make a statement that what is currently happening has to stop - and we\u2019re stopping it physically with our bodies, by getting in the way,\u201d Burkhardt said.\n\nOther protests in Boston have not led to arrests, in part because the protests are still relatively small and because of local sensibilities, he said.", "description": "Gathered in a dark room of a historic Boston church, about a dozen people sat in folding chairs, some with their dogs at their feet, talking about the threat of climate change - and how to start a new revolution.
