Drone use is already growing across an array of applications. They range in size from something that could slip into your pocket right up to the behemoth weaponry used by military around the world. And they are not only in the skies - they can also be found driving on the ground, inspecting sub-sea pipelines, crawling into tight gaps too dangerous for humans or even rocketing off to outer space. They are used by emergency services, including search and rescue and tackling fires, through to innovations in agriculture, construction, humanitarian aid, wildlife preservation and personal security. It is predicted that drones will have spawned a \u00a370billion ($100bn) industry by next year. E-commerce, package and fast food delivery have yet to fully develop in this sector but companies such as Google and Amazon are investing heavily in the application of drones.", "description": "Today Uber unveiled its new drone, which utilises 'innovative rotating wings with six rotors', a design also featured in its flying car prototype.
