Well, Jones did win the 2006 national junior college championship in wrestling at Iowa Central Community College, and Ferguson was a 2006 National Collegiate Wrestling Association national champion in the 165-pound division. Did something happen between them that we\u2019re unaware of?\n\nHere\u2019s Ferguson\u2019s tweet:\n\nLot Of Shit Talk @JonnyBones You Wanna Play Again Like We Did In College? I Bumped Up Two Weight Classes & I\u2019ll Do It Again \ud83c\udf31 Growth. You Wanna Play Chess I\u2019ll Be Your Huckleberry.

Got You In 2 Neanderthal, Talked To Your Pops He Knows Who\u2019s Champ. # Anklepick # DavidVSGoliath\n\nWho knows what Ferguson could be talking about? But it appears to date back to their wrestling days. Both guys have been looking for a fight, with Ferguson hoping to finally get his crack at lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Jones trying to figure out a worthy contender at 205 pounds.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: Ferguson is crazy enough to take a fight with Jones, not that it would happen. Then again, \u201cEl Cucuy\u201d did step to Fabricio Werdum at a media luncheon a couple years ago, threatening to ankle pick him.\n\nNever change, Tony Ferguson.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
