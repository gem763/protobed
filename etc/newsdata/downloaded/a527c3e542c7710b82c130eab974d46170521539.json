I trace it back to my dad driving me to school most mornings, listening to the news every day \u2014 followed by classical or jazz channels.\n\nOne time the anchor went on about all these people, spending thousands of dollars they didn't have, using plastic cards. And his voice morphed into \"wah wahs\" straight out of Charlie Brown, as the numbers started getting bigger and bigger.\n\nFrom that moment on I resolved to never touch a credit card. I continued to hold onto my debit card until I was 20.\n\nLooking back, the anchor must have been talking about the staggering figures posted up for credit card debt that year. The New York Fed releases a quarterly report for household debt, and as of March 2019, America's collective credit card debt is sitting at $870 billion.\n\nOverall household debts have risen for 18 consecutive quarters. We're buying more, borrowing more, dreaming more. Way more than we have.\n\nBut that doesn't mean credit cards are bad. They're simply a tool, and that's something I came to understand later on. Used correctly they have a number of benefits, which \u2014 once I grew past my initial fear \u2014 I was able to harness.\n\nSee how far I've come.\n\nMy current credit profile\n\nHow do I stack up versus America?\n\nCredit score:\n\nMine: Excellent (750 - 850)\n\nExcellent (750 - 850) U.S. average: Fair (675)*\n\nNumber of credit cards:\n\nMe: 2\n\n2 U.S. average: 4\n\nCredit limit:\n\nMine: $15,000\n\n$15,000 U.S. average: $22,589\n\nTypical balance:\n\nMine: $2,163\n\n$2,163 U.S. average: 6,028\n\nCredit utilization:\n\nMine: 14%\n\n14% U.S. average: 30%\n\nU.S. averages are from Experian's State of Credit 2018 report.\n\nYes, I have two credit cards now.\n\nNow I didn't share this as a humble brag. I'm just trying to provide a frame of reference for my experience. I didn't include exact values because they say you shouldn't share any credit details on the internet. But here I am. Sharing.\n\nWhich credit cards do you carry? I currently have two cash back credit cards, with different reward categories. One card gives me higher cash back on groceries and gas, and the other gives me fixed rate cash back for all other purchases.\n\nHow did you choose? If you're going to get more than one credit card, definitely take a look at rewards cards that work well together. I personally chose cash back because I like the flexibility, but there are great rewards programs out there for travel credit cards.\n\nHow the heck is your credit score so high? I keep accepting credit limit increases to decrease my utilization ratio, and I make sure to check my credit score often (some might even say neurotically). I also never carry a balance, make sure to pay my bill on time every month, and sometimes pay off large purchases right away.\n\nHow I cured my credit card phobia\n\nTeerasak Ladnongkhun / Shutterstock\n\nNo, these are not mine.\n\nMore\n\nWhat really hooked me was credit companies satelliting onto college campuses. And getting ripped on by my friends and family.\n\nBut as I learned more about student credit cards, and special offers available to students \u2014 cash back, no annual fees, even rewards for maintaining good grades \u2014I realized I might be missing out and put in an application.\n\nGetting your first credit card is like credit Catch-22 \u2014 how are you supposed to qualify without a credit score? I managed to qualify because I had a part-time job, and steady deposits into my bank account (though my starting balance was only $1,000).\n\nIf you get rejected, don't be discouraged. You can apply for a secured credit card or try again another time.\n\nWhat I realized about credit cards\n\nStory continues", "description": "I went from cash to credit, and so can you.", "authors": ["Rudro Chakrabarti"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kgn54Oz0AjP5K0g8091U2w--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/c6c4b8eff9e3a8beed1657d3654bb2e9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
