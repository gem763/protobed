That runs against a not-rigorously enforced, according to CLW, Chinese law that stipulates a company may only employ a maximum of 10% of those workers. CLW noted that Foxconn had rarely used short-term staff prior to 2016, but in 2018 they made up 55% of the workforce.\n\nThe company is supposed to offer bonuses for those workers provided they stay employed for a specific period of time, but many reported not receiving any bonuses. Also, overtime hours were taken away from those who didn\u2019t meet referral quotas, the report said.\n\nApple denied \u201cmost\u201d of the allegations. \u201cWe looked into the claims by China Labor Watch and most of the allegations are false. We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor,\u201d Apple said in a statement. It added, however that the percentage of short-term workers \u201cexceeded our standards and we are working closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to MarketWatch, Foxconn Technology Group said it had found that the Zhengzhou location had \u201cworkplace compliance issues\u201d and that the use of dispatch workers was \u201cnot consistent with company guidelines. The company said it is taking steps to address the issues and will \u201cclosely monitor the situation.\u201d\n\nChina Labor Watch\u2019s annual report revealed the findings of several investigators employed at the plant, one for four years. Conditions for workers over the years period remained unchanged, the group found. For example, a base wage of $295 \u2014 insufficient to support a family in Zhengzhou \u2014 did not change in those years.\n\n\u201cApple and Foxconn know that the issue with dispatch workers is in violation of labor laws, but because it is profitable to hire dispatch workers, they haven\u2019t addressed the issue. They have allowed these violations to continue over the years,\u201d said Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch.\n\nOther complaints by the organization included work injuries that went unreported, verbal abuse at the factory and the use of student workers who were also \u201csubject to many restrictions.\u201d", "description": "China Labor Watch (CLW), a non-profit organization aimed at advocating for Chinese workers, released a damning report about the use of temporary workers at...", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ898_foxcon_ZG_20190909064533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
