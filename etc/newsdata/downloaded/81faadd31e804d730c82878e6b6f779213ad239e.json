Aside from Perkins' little black dress, which she buys in bulk so there's one less decision to make every day, nothing visually sets her apart from colleagues as we greet and join the queue for food.\n\n\"Oh, hey Mel,\" one woman says, casual as you like, as she hands her boss the tongs.\n\n\"We're very spoilt here,\" Perkins tells me. We fill our bowls with Vietnamese noodles, cabbage, herbs and succulent-looking strips of beef.\n\nAs Canva expands, Perkins is getting used to switching offices. James Brickwood\n\nThere's pumpkin for the vegetarians, but neither of us get any. A TV screen on the opposite wall, between flashing messages like \"empower others\", \"make complex things simple\" and \"set crazy big goals and make them happen\", informs us that today's lunch is a birthday request from Hao Le, a product designer.\n\n\"You've got to try the lemongrass soup,\" Perkins says as we reach the end of the buffet table. She ladles some into a couple of paper coffee cups.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who was named among the AFR Business People of the Year in 2018 and debuted on the AFR Rich List this May, seems relaxed as we sit down and set to with chopsticks. But she admits she wasn't when a real estate agent first brought her in to this space last year, which at 4600 square metres is twice the size of Canva's former home at adjacent Lacey Street.\n\n\"It looked very empty and very big. I was worried we'd be able to fill it all.\"\n\nBut Perkins is a seasoned player of office space Jenga, as Canva's 10 per cent month-on-month revenue growth rubs against the five-year leases still offered by hidebound landlords.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanva sub-let Lacey Street to SafetyCulture, another software-as-a-service cheetah, and in March moved everybody here \u2013 sweetening the change with an in-house gym, parents' room, a fully functioning micro-brewery and a rooftop bar, which it often loans out for start-up community events.\n\n\"But as it turns out, we're already running out of room here. We'll get our other office back in 18 months, and we've started looking for other places as well.\"\n\nHopefully the Canva kitchen, which employs three full-time chefs doing breakfast and lunch daily, won't be compromised by any move. The beef is a tender contrast to the crunch of the vegetables, its tamari edge a perfect match to the citrus flavour of the soup.\n\nPerkins with her Canva co-founders Cameron Adams (left) and Cliff Obrecht in 2015 in their Surry Hills office. Peter Rae\n\nAs I wolf down this winter tonic, Perkins tells me all the fresh produce is sourced from a farm Canva owns in the Hawkesbury, where the founders occasionally escape for weekends and staff can book a stay too.\n\nBut it's in talking about global matters that Perkins' eyes really light up.\n\nShe and Obrecht are just back from a break in Greece where they were guests at the wedding of Lars Rasmussen, who led the Sydney team that invented Google Maps. Later, he backed Canva when few others could understand how an Australian company letting design noobs make their own business cards and fancy Facebook posts would ever amount to much.\n\nThe Santorini holiday becomes a segue for the news that Canva has just surpassed 100 supported languages, including Greek, in its quest to eventually be available in all of them.\n\n\"We've launched a lot of challenging ones in the past year; right-to-left languages like Chinese, Arabic, Urdu and Hebrew,\" Perkins says.\n\n\"Not only did that mean taking our entire text editor and flipping it around, it's meant adjusting all the templates, supporting local payments, giving people a genuine native experience. When we say we want to make design accessible to everyone, we mean literally everyone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \"crazy big goal\" has guided Perkins for a long time.\n\nRaised in Perth, neither of her parents were entrepreneurs, but creativity was encouraged. \"I remember my mum letting me design my own birthday parties,\" she says.\n\nHer epiphany came while studying for a joint degree in arts and commerce at the University of Western Australia. She took a part-time job teaching students how to use what were then, and still are, the world's two dominant graphic design programs \u2013 Adobe's InDesign and PhotoShop.\n\nI thought, why should people have to learn this software? The software should learn people. \u2014 Melanie Perkins, Canva CEO\n\n\"It struck me, when I had to teach them, that it would take 22 steps to perform a single action on these programs,\" she says.\n\n\"I thought, why should people have to learn this software? The software should learn people.\"\n\nPerkins started small in applying this principle. In 2007 she and Obrecht, also an arts/commerce student at UWA, launched a service that helped schools design and upload their own yearbooks for printing.\n\nAfter a few hard lessons learnt \u2013 don't outsource your software development to India, kids \u2013 Fusion Books became profitable enough for Perkins to leave uni and not return. Just don't call her the \"d\" word.\n\n\"I don't like that term 'dropout'. I like completing things,\" she says, a little steel in the gaze. \"I just haven't found a spare six months recently to go back and finish my degree.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe and Obrecht moved to Sydney in 2012, and put their grand plan into action. They convinced Adams (who'd worked with Rasmussen on Google Maps) to be Canva's technical co-founder.\n\nThen after 100 revisions to their pitch deck and six months of being told \"no\", they conjured $US1.6 million in seed funding. This was despite the Silicon Valley VCs, who provided most of it, wanting Canva to move to San Francisco.\n\nPerkins says the only reason the VCs relented was she could show them that by staying in Australia, Canva's funding would be matched by an Accelerating Commercialisation grant.\n\nCliff Obrecht and Melanie Perkins in the early days of Fusion Books.\n\n\"It just shows the role policy can play in helping Australian companies take the global stage,\" she says.\n\nI suggest that is a veiled reference to the recent crackdown on the research and development refund, another lifeline for early Canva. Also to the uncertain, time-consuming process start-ups must endure to import executives experienced in the \"scale-up\" phase where Canva now finds itself.\n\nBut she's not biting. Well, only the noodles. \"We need to ask ourselves where we want Australia to be in 10 years' time, and work back from there,\" Perkins demurs.\n\nCanva has already left Australia in a manner of speaking. Its ultimate parent company is now domiciled in the tax-efficient US state of Delaware, and its software is used inside 80 per cent of Fortune 500 companies. The accepted wisdom among investors I've spoken to is that should Canva list, it will be on the NASDAQ instead of the ASX.\n\nNot that Perkins is in any hurry to go public, nor replace herself with a \"professional\" CEO in preparation for the day.\n\n\"I've got the best job I could possibly have at the moment. Investors seem to like what we're doing, and I get to spend 95 per cent of my time making Canva better instead of worrying about external perceptions of it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerkins knows the volume of those \u201cexternal perceptions\u201d will only increase as Canva grows. The company is now in rarefied air in Australia, up there with Atlassian, Afterpay and WiseTech as exemplars of the technology powerhouse we might become, if only the tall poppy syndrome would let us.\n\nI ask Perkins whether she\u2019s ever tempted to make that move to San Francisco, where older brother Greg works as a 3D printing artist. Start-ups worth $3.6 billion are a dime a dozen there. A cyber attack in May in which 139 million Canva user emails and encrypted passwords were stolen would have barely made a TechCrunch brief, rather than the headline fodder it was here.\n\nAdmittedly Canva did itself no favours in its initial warning email to users, burying news of the hack under a rave about the stock imagery sites it had just bought. A tendency to accentuate the positive, needed by its founders to persevere through those tough early days, annoyed users who'd rather have been told straight-up that they should change their password.\n\nMost people want to see Australian companies succeed; they understand we have to be innovators, not just consumers. \u2014 Melanie Perkins, Canva CEO\n\nJust as I\u2019m broaching that security breach, Obrecht strolls through the cafe walking Pumbah, the couple\u2019s Staffordshire cross. Tail wagging and taking every pat he\u2019s offered, the dog has clearly been to this pooch-friendly workplace many times before.\n\nWe never quite get back to the hack, which Perkins seemed about as comfortable discussing as she does other non-mission topics, like hobbies outside of work \u2013 she occasionally ice skates, and wants to \"see more of the world\" with Obrecht \u2013 or the $1 billion paper wealth she and her fiancee are now speculated to share.\n\nIn any case, Canva quickly responded to blowback and resent its warning email, and there\u2019s been no outward sign of the incident slowing momentum. A recent graduate intern program attracted \u201cliterally thousands\u201d of applicants, Perkins says.\n\n\u201cOverall I\u2019m amazed at how much support we\u2019ve had. Most people want to see Australian companies succeed; they understand we have to be innovators, not just consumers.\u201d\n\nConsumed as our beef noodles now are, Perkins is visibly keen to get back to democratising design.\n\nShe might have started taking off \u201cmost Saturdays\u201d and half of Sundays in the past couple of years, but the founder in the little black dress still has big ambitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn China, for instance. Perkins tells me Canva now has 28 people in Beijing after opening an office there last year. It\u2019s struck partnerships with the country\u2019s largest libraries for images and fonts, and \u201ccompletely reinvented\u201d its product for a Weibo and WeChat world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to have a team that cares as much as I do about getting Canva into the hands of everybody. We\u2019re at 15 million users but there\u2019s three billion people on the internet today, so we\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d\n\nThen with as little fanfare as she arrived, Melanie Perkins goes back to work.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a long way to go\u201d: Perkins isn't planning on resting up any time soon.
