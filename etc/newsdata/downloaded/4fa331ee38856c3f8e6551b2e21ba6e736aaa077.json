After the news leaked that he maybe, just maybe might be playing a certain caped crusader, the actor flew from Cannes to Los Angeles in a fit of anxiety about losing the part. If that\u2019s not all of us on a slow, sweaty subway ride into work, I just don\u2019t know! In an interview with Variety, the actor explained how he finally landed the role of Batman and how he realized that a certain theme keeps popping up in his work.\n\nPattinson, who\u2019s known to chase after directors he wants to work with, reached out to Matt Reeves before the Batman script had even been finished. \u201cI sort of had an idea to do it, and I\u2019d been prodding Matt,\u201d Pattinson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t accept any prods.\u201d Then, while in Cannes, reading over Batman scripts, the press leaked the news that he was being considered for the part. \u201cWhen that thing leaked, I was f\u2014ing furious,\u201d Pattinson explained. \u201cEveryone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\u201d Ultimately, it didn\u2019t matter because it all came down to one thing: How did he feel in the Batsuit? \u201cYou do feel very powerful immediately,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty astonishing, something that is incredibly difficult to get into, so the ritual of getting into it is pretty humiliating. You\u2019ve got five people trying to shove you into something. Once you\u2019ve got it on, it\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, I feel strong, I feel tough, even though I had to have someone squeezing my butt cheeks into the legs.\u2019\u201d\n\nUsually, he\u2019s the only one doing the squeezing though. (So sorry.) \u201cI keep masturbating,\u201d Pattinson was \u201ceager\u201d to explain to Variety. \u201cIn the last three or four movies, I\u2019ve got a masturbation scene. I did it in High Life. I did it in Damsel. And The Devil All the Time. I only realized when I did it the fourth time.\u201d If three\u2019s a pattern and No. 4 was masturbating to a clay mermaid statue in Robert Eggers\u2019s \u201cincredibly weird\u201d movie The Lighthouse, then five has absolutely got to be his next project, Matt Reeves\u2019s Batman film. Now that he\u2019s officially going to be the Dark Knight, perhaps Reeves will add a scene that really brings Pattinson to a familiar place. You know what they say. Fifth time\u2019s the charm.", "description": "Robert Pattinson opens up about landing the role of Batman, wearing the Batsuit, and his new film, \u201cThe Lighthouse.\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-robert-pattinson.w1200.h630.jpg"}
