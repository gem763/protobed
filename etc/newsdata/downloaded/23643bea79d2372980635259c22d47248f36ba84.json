You are going to want all of that.\"\n\nTesla could be at a point where it could upload software for its vehicles to have \"robotaxi\" functionality, albeit with a human ready to take control, by the end of this year, according to Musk.\n\n\"I mean the car will drive from one's house to work, most likely without interventions,\" Musk explained.\n\n\"It will still be supervised, but able to fill in the gap from low-speed autonomy with Summon and high-speed autonomy on the highway.\"\n\nA version of the feature \"reliable enough that you don't have to pay attention\" to driving could be ready by the end of next year, but would be subject to approval by regulators, he added.\n\n- Going home again -\n\nMusk expected the Shanghai factory to hit \"volume production\" in a few months, and to make it possible to significantly ramp up Tesla production. He noted that a battery plant was also being built on the China site.\n\nThe shareholder letter said Tesla expects to boost vehicle deliveries and that \"we are highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\"\n\nTesla said deliveries of its Model 3, the most affordable vehicle in its lineup and a key to broader sales, reached 79.8 million in the past quarter, an increase of 50 percent compared to last year.\n\nWith Model 3 production pressure lifted, Tesla has been able to return engineering talent and other resources such as power cell production to its unit specializing in solar roofs and home power storage packs, according to Musk.\n\nHe felt that the Tesla Energy unit has long-term potential to be as big a business as its automotive division, or maybe even bigger.\n\n\"Now that car production is in a good place, we have restored resources to Tesla Energy so that is going to see crazy growth,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to promote development of sustainable energy and renewable energy vehicles.\"", "description": "Tesla shares raced higher in after-hours trading Wednesday following the company's announcement that its factory in China had started production and quarterly financial results that beat expectations.
