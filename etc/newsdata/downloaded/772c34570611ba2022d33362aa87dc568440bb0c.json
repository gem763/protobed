The flanker was everywhere, barking orders, cajoling and encouraging.\n\nHe was surprisingly dropped to the bench for the Ireland game, in what turned out to be a masterstroke by Japan coach Jamie Joseph.\n\nAngry at being left out, a rampaging Leitch turned the game after coming on after just 30 minutes.\n\nHe returned to the back row against Samoa and was comfortably the best player on the pitch, biffing Pacific islanders out of his path with gusto in a rampaging display as he once again led by example.\n\nIreland: Jonathan Sexton\n\n\n\nFlyhalves by their nature are key figures but few sides lean more heavily on their number 10 than Ireland do on Jonathan Sexton, reigning World Player of the Year.\n\nSexton missed Ireland's game against Japan with a thigh injury and although the Irish went 12-3 up in his absence, they missed the Leinster star's tactical control in what became a damaging defeat.\n\nHe returned to captain Ireland for the first time against Russia but played just the opening 40 minutes.\n\nIreland's first-choice goal-kicker when fit, Sexton directs play with an authority that understudies Jack Carty and Joey Carbery, for all their undoubted talent, cannot match.\n\n\"Johnny sees things unfolding before they happen,\" said Ireland centre Chris Farrell.\n\n\"He's so exciting to play with because he gives you space and time on the ball.\"\n\nWales: Hadleigh Parkes\n\n\n\nThe Kiwi-born centre was labelled an ageing journeyman by many critics after Warren Gatland handed him a debut at the age of 30, having qualified for Wales through three years of residency. He has proven his detractors wrong, a panic-free approach to the game setting an example to all.\n\nParkes rarely makes mistakes: he is often used on the crash-ball, but is equally adept at linking up with centre partner Jonathan Davies and setting the back three away in attack.\n\nHe is also a solid defender, whose incredible try-saving tackle on Jacob Stockdale was a decisive moment in Wales beating Ireland to seal last season's Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nParkes scored the opening try in the 29-25 win over Australia, playing despite a minor fracture in his hand.\n\n\"It'll slowly improve as time goes by,\" said assistant Wales coach Robin McBryde. \"He managed to catch that ball and score a try, so that is good enough for me.\"\n\nAustralia: Matt To'omua\n\n\n\nMatt To'omua has become the Wallabies' Mr Dependable. If he's not starting, he's coming off the bench as an influencer.\n\nA man who can straighten a backline and take the ball to the gain line, To'omua has developed from being back-up to inside centre Samu Kerevi to being tipped to replace Christian Lealiifano as first choice Wallaby flyhalf.\n\nHaving come off the bench against Fiji and Wales to fill the flyhalf role, and starting at inside centre against Uruguay, To'omua believes he is \"auditioning with the 12 on the back for a 10 jersey\".\n\nNic White and Lealiifano started as halves against Fiji, and Australia were down 21-20 when To'omua replaced Lealiifano. They won 39-21.\n\nAgainst Wales, with Will Genia and Bernard Foley in the halves, the Wallabies were down 26-8 until the strong-running To'omua replaced Foley, and by the final whistle the score had narrowed to 29-25.\n\nEngland: Sam Underhill\n\nAs part of the youngest back row to represent England in the professional era, Sam Underhill is set to be part of England's plans for many years to come and has shone at his first World Cup.\n\nMan-of-the-man against Argentina, Underhill's phenomenal work at the breakdown has seen coach Eddie Jones dub him and Tom Curry the 'kamikaze kids', because they \"hit everything that moves\".\n\nBorn in the USA, the Bath Rugby man is shorter than the average flanker at 1.86m but makes up for it with his tackling work-rate. Against Argentina, he made 16 tackles and not a single handling error in what turned out to be a comfortable 39-10 win.\n\nFrance: Damian Penaud\n\n\n\nDamian Penaud, the 23-year-old Clermont outside back, has become France's go-to player when a touch of inspiration is needed.\n\nWhen Tonga threatened to pull off a stunning upset after a late try closed the score to 23-21 on Sunday, it was Penaud who chased the restart, leaping high in the face of the Tongans to regain possession for France, denying the Pacific islanders one last chance to attack.\n\nHis stunning footwork also helped unravel the Argentina defence for France's two tries in their opening match by Gael Fickou and Antoine Dupont.\n\nSon of former French flyhalf Alain Penaud, he can play centre or wing - where he made the most metres (59) and beat the most defenders (seven) against Argentina.", "description": "As the Rugby World Cup pool stages head into the final round, here is a look at some of the stand-out players so far.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2859/a41e063273df4025a7b37c0ddef7ae44.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
