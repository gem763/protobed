He had all the support to do it and it showed that he was psychologically ready to break the barrier,\u201d said Mokoka.\n\nThe Mahikeng runner was one of the pacemakers in Kipchoge\u2019s previous attempt, dubbed Breaking2, in Italy in 2017 when he fell just 25 seconds short of his goal.\n\n\u201cI was a bit sceptical at first, but I changed my mind after meeting him. He is a humble person, but he is different in a race due to his dedication. If a sub-two-hour marathon was to happen in an official race in future, it would take all the contenders to be in the same shape as Kipchoge to do it.\u201d\n\nKipchoge, the Olympic champion and world record holder over the classic 42km distance, achieved the feat yesterday with a team of 41 pacemakers who were guided by lasers projected on to the road by a lead car.\n\nBecause these aided the conditions, Kipchoge\u2019s achievement will not count as an official world record.\n\nRamaala, the 2004 New York Marathon winner, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s an unofficial time or not \u2013 this was a mental barrier. Personally, I am inspired that it took a determined human being to run a marathon in less than two hours.\n\nThe lessons we can take from Kipchoge\u2019s effort as South Africans is that our sport can flourish if corporate firms were to invest heavily in athletics. Hendrick Ramaala\n\n\u201cIneos [a private UK multinational chemicals company] and Nike shared a common dream in Kipchoge\u2019s case \u2013 they wanted to break a barrier and they achieved that. My guys [Ramaala\u2019s team] were watching and it\u2019s all about inspiring the next generation,\u201d he said.\n\nRamaala managed Team SA\u2019s marathon team at the recent IAAF World Championships in Qatar, where Mokoka finished fifth, the best placing by a South African in the competition.\n\nIronically, Mokoka went to Qatar after smashing Ramaala\u2019s long-standing 21km record. Mokoka broke the 60-minute barrier at the Buenos Aires Half Marathon in Argentina in August.\n\nHe finished fourth, but his time of 59:51 took 16 seconds off the 1:00:07 set by Ramaala in 1997.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the belief. In Kipchoge\u2019s case, he believed he could do it after he came 25 seconds short in Monza [Italy],\u201d said Ramaala.\n\n\u201cThey did their homework this time and, most importantly, the [sponsors] came on board. But still, one can\u2019t take away that Kipchoge did it with his dedication to break the last barrier in athletics \u2013 the marathon.\u201d\n\nRamaala said it was going to be a huge challenge to break the two-hour mark in an official race. The official world record stands at 2:01:39, set by Kipchoge in the Berlin Marathon last year.\n\nThe jubilant Kenyan said: \u201cI am feeling good. It has taken 65 years for a human to make history in sport. After Roger Bannister [running a sub-four-minute mile in 1954] it took another 65 years \u2026 I\u2019m happy to be the man to run under two hours. No human is limited, and I\u2019m expecting more people to do it after today.\u201d", "description": "South African marathon runner Stephen Mokoka and the legendary Hendrick Ramaala say Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s historic sub-two-hour marathon record yesterday is a huge boost for long-distance running.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9468/e1551733b16d4933afca5640d43fc749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
