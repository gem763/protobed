Mr. Trump has made attacks on the news media a mainstay of his presidency, and he tweeted a similar \u2014 but far less violent video \u2014 in 2017. In recent weeks as he has confronted impeachment proceedings, he has ramped up his attacks on the news media, repeatedly calling it the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nA person who attended the conference last week took a video of the clip on his phone and had an intermediary send it to a reporter for The Times. Parts of the video were posted on YouTube in 2018 by a user with a history of creating pro-Trump mash-ups.\n\nThe organizer of the event said in a statement on Sunday that the clip had been played at the conference, saying it was part of a \u201cmeme exhibit.\u201d He denounced the video and said his organization was looking into how it was shown at the event.\n\n\u201cContent was submitted by third parties and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity,\u201d said the organizer, Alex Phillips. \u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review.\u201d", "description": "The video was shown at a conference attended by Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
