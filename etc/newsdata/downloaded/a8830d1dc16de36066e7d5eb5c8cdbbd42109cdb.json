EST: President Donald Trump confirmed Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry is leaving his post, telling reporters on Thursday that he was going to announce the decision at his rally later tonight. The president said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the news, noting that Perry had told him of his desire to step down six months ago. President Trump also suggested that he had already picked a replacement. \u201cHe told me at the end of the year he\u2019d like to go and he\u2019s got some ideas about doing something else,\u201d the president said, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a terrific guy.\u201d\n\nA new report claims Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified President Donald Trump on Thursday that he is leaving his administration, though it is unclear when he will officially step down from his post.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Perry told the president of his plans to leave while flying aboard Air Force One en route to Dallas, Texas. Earlier this month, the Trump cabinet member denied reports that he plans to exit his role.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m serving,\u201d Perry told reporters during a press conference in Lithuania.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been writing the story for at least nine months now. One of these days they will probably get it right, but it\u2019s not today, it\u2019s not tomorrow, it\u2019s not next month,\u201d he added.\n\nReports of Perry\u2019s imminent departure come after House chairmen subpoenaed Perry seeking documents related to their impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nReps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the late Elijah Cummings (D-MD), and Eliot Engel (D-NY) sent a letter to Perry seeking information about his involvement in a July call between the president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky detailed in a so-called whistle-blower\u2019s report.\n\nThe chairmen cited reports stating that Perry may have had a role \u201cconveying or reinforcing\u201d President Trump\u2019s message that the United States would provide Ukraine with military aid on the condition that it investigated former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. However, both the president and Zelensky have denied any pressure was applied to look into allegations of corruption against the Biden family.\n\nThe subpoena requests that Perry provide the documents by October 18th.\n\nThe UPI and Charlie Spiering contributed to this report.", "description": "Rick Perry reportedly notified President Trump that he is leaving his administration, though it is unclear when he will officially step down.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/wi/afp/28/216f1f_us-energy-secretary-rick-perry-in-2018-trump-administration-has-approved-e1571348677110-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
