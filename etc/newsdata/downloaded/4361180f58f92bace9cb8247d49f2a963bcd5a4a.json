During this meeting, Pillay allegedly took Malema to task for saying SARS was targeting Zuma loyalists.\n\n\"I said to them it's wrong to target people based on their political affiliation. Pillay said to me that he had helped sort out Zuma's tax affairs, so how could I say they were targeting Zuma people?\"\n\nIt was after this that Van Loggerenberg met with him, Malema said.\n\nREAD MORE: EFF\u2019s Julius Malema asked SARS 'rogue unit' boss for help\n\nVan Loggerenberg allegedly presented Malema with his tax bill before matters surrounding the \"rogue unit\" were discussed.\n\nMalema said he was surprised by this, adding he believed SARS was trying to intimidate and silence him.\n\n\"That's how they survived,\" he said. \"But I told them to fuck off, that if there was issues with my tax they should send me a letter.\"\n\nMalema denied he never told Van Loggerenberg he had accepted SARS' version about the unit. He also challenged him to release the illegal recording of the meeting.\n\nVan Loggerenberg's version\n\nIn a statement released on Friday evening, Van Loggerenberg acknowledged Malema's comments, saying it would appear the EFF leader's memory failed him at times.\n\n\"I have emails, recorded phone calls as recorded by myself, and self-made recordings of interactions between the attorney for Mr Julius Malema, namely Mr Tumi Mokwena, who made contact with me on March 3, 2015, on behalf of his client soon after I left SARS,\" he said.\n\n\"It specifically concerned Mr Malema's dispute with SARS at that time. I met with Mr Mokwena three times at his request. These culminated in a final meeting soon after, where Mr Mokwena was not prepared to enter into a signed service agreement with me, nor accept my normal business practice of providing invoices for services rendered.\"\n\nAccording to Van Loggerenberg, Mokwena had insisted he provided services without invoices and accepted payment in cash.\n\n\"I declined and that ended the interaction. I reported this to SARS and the SSA [State Security Agency] formally at the time. In 2017, Mr Mokwena again called me for tax advice regarding Mr Malema. I was unable to assist him. Mr Malema can obtain these details and records from Mr Mokwena if he so wishes.\"\n\nVan Loggerenberg also said Malema was confusing the timeline of events pertaining to when they met.\n\nIn a press statement released by SARS on August 23, 2013, the tax authority sought to set the record straight.\n\n\"The meeting at the Sheraton Hotel preceded the meeting with SARS that he is referring to.\n\n\"The conversation between Mr Malema and I was recorded lawfully by me since I met him alone at the request of SARS. This was required precisely to avoid any misconceptions that might have arisen later.\"", "description": "The former SARS executive at the centre of the \"rogue unit\" saga, Johann van Loggerenberg, says he has recorded phone calls and emails that prove EFF leader Julius Malema had asked for help with his tax affairs through his attorney at the time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9434/fa2f3fa9196d43cf896801f8baf4f3d3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
