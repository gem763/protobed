Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt is hosting Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch leader Mark Rutte at his country residence outside Stockholm to discuss the EU.\n\nBut Britain\u2019s premier is not happy that, under new rules, Juncker is frontrunner for the EU\u2019s top job.\n\n\u201cThis meeting today is really about content, about what Europe should be doing in the next few years,\u201d Cameron told reporters. \u201cBut I would just make this important point of principle, which is that as the democratically-elected leaders of Europe, we should be the ones who choose who should run these institutions, rather than accept some new process, which was never agreed and I think that is important.\u201d\n\nSeen as too federalist by Cameron, Luxembourg\u2019s ex-leader is favourite, given the support he has from the centre-right European People\u2019s Party, the EU\u2019s largest political grouping after last month\u2019s European elections. He has also had official backing from Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel \u2013 but Cameron is hoping to win her over.\n\nFacing re-election next year, Cameron has pledged to try to reshape Britain\u2019s ties with the EU and to give Britons an in/out EU referendum in 2017. If he fails to block Juncker, he stands to lose face at home and abroad and could see his ruling Conservative Party\u2019s fragile unity begin to fray.", "description": "Some are calling it the \u2018Stop Juncker\u2019 summit.\n\n\tFor blocking Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s bid to become European Commission President is widely considered", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2014-06-09"}
