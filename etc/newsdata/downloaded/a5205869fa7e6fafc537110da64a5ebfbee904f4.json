Now I feel better. Now I feel less alone,\" so how can you say these movies are not helping people?'\n\nThis comes shortly after Coppola backed up Martin Scorsese's recent anti-Marvel views.\n\nThe 80 year old filmmaker was in Lyon, France, accepting the Prix Lumiere for his contributions to cinema, when he was asked about Scorsese's controversial comments.\n\nHelping people: He said in response to Coppola: 'People have been going up to me like \"Thank you so much for this character,\" \"This movie helped me out so much,\" \"This movie inspired me. Now I feel better. Now I feel less alone,\" so how can you say these movies are not helping people?'\n\nWinter Soldier: Stan is known for his role as Winter Soldier in the Marvel Studios film franchise, which he'll next revive for the Disney+ show The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAccording to Yahoo, he said: 'When Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he's right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration.\n\n'I don't know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.'\n\nHe added: 'Martin was kind when he said it's not cinema. He didn't say it's despicable, which I just say it is.'\n\nThis comes after Scorsese told Empire: 'I don't see them. I tried, you know? But that's not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\n\nMarvel bashing: Just days after Martin Scorsese bashed Marvel Studios superhero movies, he got another ally in Francis Ford Coppola who agrees with Scorsese's stance\n\nCinema: 'It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being'\n\nDirector: Coppola hasn't directed a movie since 2011's Twixt, but he has been working on a project called Megalopolis for the past two decades\n\n'It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.'\n\nScorsese's statement lead to several Marvel Studios directors to respond to his criticism, including Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn.\n\nGunn tweeted: 'Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I'm saddened that he's now judging my films in the same way.'\n\nHe added: 'That said, I will always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contribution to cinema, and can't wait to see The Irishman.\n\n'And I'm not saying religious zealotry is the same as not liking my movies, or in the same category. What I'm saying is I'm not fond of people judging things without actually seeing them, whether it's a movie about Jesus or a genre.'", "description": "Coppola recently chimed in after Martin Scorsese bashed the superhero franchise: 'Martin was kind when he said it's not cinema.
