Trump welcomes the 2019 Stanley Cup Champions, the St. Louis Blues to The White House on Tuesday, October 15, 2019. Mandatory Credit: Jack Gruber-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cIt was a very lighthearted, fun kind of celebration,\u201d said Blues chairman Tom Stillman, who gave the president a \u201cTrump\u201d No. 45 Blues jersey. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect it to be lots of laughs and comfortable \u2014 jokes. It was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nIn March, more than nine months after the Washington Capitals won the 2018 title, not all of the team\u2019s players attended a similar ceremony, including starting goaltender Braden Holtby and right wing Brett Connolly, who previously said they would not attend.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case Tuesday. The only player missing was new defenseman Justin Faulk, who joined the Blues in a trade with the Carolina Hurricanes before the regular season. He hasn\u2019t been part of any Cup-related events.\n\n\u201cI think this team acts as a team in everything they do,\u201d Stillman said via the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \u201cThey stick together and I think by and large, I like to keep politics and sports separate.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter of a traditional honor by the presidency, and it\u2019s something you do. And I\u2019m really proud of our group for all coming together - and had a good time with it as well.\u201d\n\nWhile the president did take time to comment on developments in Turkey and Syria, he did touch on the accomplishment by the Blues, who beat the Boston Bruins in seven games to earn the title.\n\nTrump singled out center Jaden Schwartz for his 12-goal performance (though calling him Jason a couple of times), and goalie Jordan Binnington, who made 32 saves on 33 shots in the Game 7 finale, a 4-1 victory.\n\nAsked by Trump how that one shot got past him, Binnington simply replied, \u201cIt\u2019s my bad.\u201d\n\nTrump also wanted to know if the pressure was off in St. Louis after the Blues finally won for the first time in four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d head coach Craig Berube responded.\n\nThere was no meal served to the Blues contingent during their stay, but they were given a tour of the White House that included more time with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues visited the White House on Tuesday, showing up en masse for a ceremony with President Donald Trump in the Rose Garden.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441285951&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E24D-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
