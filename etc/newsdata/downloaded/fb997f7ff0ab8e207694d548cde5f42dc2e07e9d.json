The news comes as Tesla announced a $408 million loss for the second quarter of 2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not disappearing, and I just wanted to make sure that people understand that this was not some, you know, lack of confidence in the company, or the team, or anything like that,\u201d Straubel said on the call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank JB for his fundamental role in creating and enabling Tesla,\u201d CEO Elon Musk said on a call with analysts Wednesday evening. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had lunch in 2003, Tesla wouldn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t exist, basically.\u201d\n\nVice president of technology Drew Baglino will take over Straubel\u2019s responsibilities, Musk said, though it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s formally assuming the CTO role. \u201cI\u2019ll just say, you know, obviously, big, big shoes to fill,\u201d Baglino said on the call.\n\nStraubel joined Tesla in the mid-2000s, right around when Musk first invested in the startup, which was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.
