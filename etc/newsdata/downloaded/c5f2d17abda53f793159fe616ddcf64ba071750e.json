Here\u2019s a great compilation of just a few examples across 35 months.\n\nWhen the anti-Trump media weren\u2019t promoting impeachment, CNN was pushing what anchor Wolf Blitzer called \u201cquestions about the president's mental fitness\u201d and 25th Amendment solutions as another way to oust Trump.\n\nCNN SHAMES GOP SENATORS WHO 'NEED MORE INFO' ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CONTROVERSY\n\nNow they will do anything they need to support any effort to send Trump into political retirement. That includes either skipping stories that undermine the impeachment effort or censoring massive chunks of text to manipulate the result.\n\nRemember when we had the missing 18-minute gap in the Watergate tapes? Now we have the missing 540 words of the Ukraine transcript. The big difference is the media complained about the first gap and created the second gap all their own, to establish a phony narrative about President Trump asking the Ukrainian president for a favor.\n\nI credit the word tally to The Federalist, which analyzed the transcript against the narrative manufactured by the press. The site pointed out how journalists jumped from the Trump\u2019s initial request in the call \u201cto do us a favor\u201d all the way down to a completely separate section where he wanted to \u201ctalk about Biden's son.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump was actually asking about in the \u201cfavor\u201d section was computer hacking and a company named Crowdstrike. The Biden stuff came later.\n\nThe press didn\u2019t care. Journalist after journalist flat-out lied about what Trump said. MSNBC, CNN, NPR. It didn\u2019t matter the outlet, they pushed the same narrative.\n\nMSNBC anchor Katy Tur was one of the worst. (Shocker, I know.) She just made up what Trump said and viewers who didn\u2019t check the transcript would have easily been deceived. She claimed Trump asked: \u201cWill you do me a favor and investigate Vice President Biden\u2019s son? Will you do me a favor and get involved in the 2020 election? Vice President Biden is my chief political opponent.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Trump said nothing about the election or Biden being his opponent. He commented how \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution,\u201d which is true. (Here\u2019s the video.)\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Blitzer, who explained the situation this way: \u201cIn the ... this summary that was released by the White House, the president specifically quoted as saying to the Ukrainian president, \u2018I would like you to do us a favor\u2019 and then goes into an investigation into the Bidens and the Democrats.\u201d Blitzer skipped over the same words as the others.\n\nBroadcast news was no different. \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d Chief Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes used a nearly identical synopsis of the call: \u201cMr. Trump asked the president of Ukraine for a favor, to look into campaign rival Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter.\u201d\n\nAnd when journalists weren\u2019t making up their own fictional accounts, they were largely ignoring the made-up accounts of Hill Democrats. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., fictionalized the call during the hearing and few in the press even noted it.\n\nSchiff said: \u201cI'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it.\u201d Fact-check obsessed reporters didn\u2019t care.\n\nThat\u2019s because the media are thrilled. MSNBC host Chris Matthews told \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d \"they've got him!\" That\u2019s their mindset. Not news.\n\nLive by the tweet \u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of Cancel Culture, but you\u2019ve seen it happening all around you. Essentially, it\u2019s when the Internet mob and some media outlets gang up on people to try and destroy their lives.\n\nNewer lefty outlets like BuzzFeed have popularized it, but major media outlets do it, too. Which brings us to the Des Moines Register\u2019s attempt to destroy the life of 24-year-old Carson King. The Iowa State football fan and beer drinker held up a sign saying \u201cBusch Light Supply Needs Replenished\u201d during ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay.\u201d He included a link to send him money and, remarkably, people did just that.\n\nHe was given so much money that he decided to donate it to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital. Corporate support soon followed \u2014 including Anheuser-Busch \u2014 and the total topped $1 million.\n\nAXED DES MOINES REGISTER REPORTER BLAMES 'RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGUES' FOR FIRING, SUGGESTS HE'S OPPRESSED\n\nThe Register decided to profile King. Reporter Aaron Calvin dug into King\u2019s tweets to find inappropriate comments he made when he was 16. King was remorseful, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for the Register, which included the old tweets in its profile.\n\nKing beat them to the punch and held a press conference apologizing. The story came out and many on Twitter were unhappy, to say the least. The Register went into damage control mode. It released a statement explaining the story process and saying \u201ceditors decided we would include the information.\u201d\n\nTwitter users soon uncovered that Calvin \u2013 the reporter who wrote the story \u2013 had his own offensive tweets, including a version of the N-word. The Washington Post described those comments as \u201ctroubling posts that mocked same-sex marriage, made light of abuse against women and used a racial slur.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nReaders were furious. Register Executive Editor Carol Hunter wrote another piece headlined: \u201cWe hear you. You\u2019re angry. Here\u2019s what we are doing about it.\u201d She told readers: \u201cWe took appropriate action.\u201d Only they didn\u2019t. They blamed the reporter and didn\u2019t apologize for what they did.\n\nAccording to Calvin, they told him he could quit or be fired and he chose to be fired. Hunter and others at the paper suffered no consequences for their decision to attack King over a few high school comments.\n\nNow Calvin is whining to BuzzFeed, one of the worst advocates of Cancel Culture. According to BuzzFeed: \u201c\u2018Now that gay marriage is legal,\u2019 he wrote in one 2012 tweet, \u2018I\u2019m totally going to marry a horse.\u2019\u201d He also wrote \u201cf---- all cops,\u201d without my polite editing.\n\nBut Calvin said he feels \u201cabandoned\u201d by the newspaper, since \u201cthe editor knew, the editorial board knew, and the executive editor knew\u201d how he handled the tweets. Naturally, he blamed conservatives for costing him his job, saying \u201cthis whole campaign was taken up by right-wing ideologues and largely driven by that force.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLook for more outlets to lionize Calvin, if only to justify their own similar attempts to destroy conservatives over ancient comments.\n\nKing gets to have the last laugh. Much of the world sided with him and his charity efforts have now topped $2 million. And the only person canceled was the one who tried to cancel him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "It looks like Trump-hating journalists are getting their dearest wish \u2014 the beginning of impeachment proceedings against the president.", "authors": ["Dan Gainor", "Dan Gainor Is The Vice President For Techwatch", "Business", "Culture At The"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Pelosi-Trump-Thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
