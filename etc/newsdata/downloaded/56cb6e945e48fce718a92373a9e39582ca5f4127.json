Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) slammed Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) Medicare for All plan as a \u201cpipe dream\u201d during the fourth Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio, Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here in saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this. Taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people as to where we send the invoice.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar explained to Warren that a public option is necessary to bring down healthcare premium costs of those covered and said that Warren\u2019s plan fails to do that.\n\n\u201cThe boldest idea here is not to trash Obamacare but to do what Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that\u2019s have a public option to bring down the cost of the premium and expand the cost of the covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what we should be doing instead of kick 149 million people off their insurance in four years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work, but the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d she added.\n\nEarlier in the debate, Warren was asked a yes or no question as to whether she would raise healthcare costs in her Medicare for All plan. She responded that costs will go up for the rich and down for those who are not.\n\nButtigieg attempted to bring up his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d idea but failed to take on Warren\u2019s rebuttal when she slammed Buttigieg\u2019s plan as \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
