They said their vows, danced all night and even shared some cake.\n\nBut in the end, it was the flower arrangements that left behind the biggest impression. Yes, this bride\u2019s chicken nugget bouquet is everything you\u2019ve ever wanted in wedding decor. And it all started with a simple email to Tyson brand.\n\nSteuber Florist\n\n\"It was like two days before the wedding and I was preparing for my speech, and as I was writing it I knew I wanted to go out with a bang,\" Jenna Spetz, maid of honor and cousin of the bride, told \"Good Morning America.\" \"I didn\u2019t know of anything that would make her smile unless it was nuggets! So I thought, let\u2019s just shoot an email to Tyson to see if they could surprise her with anything.\"\n\nAlthough Spetz had every intention to shock the Toledo, Ohio, couple, she didn\u2019t think they would answer and didn't check her email until hours after sending her first message. Meanwhile, Tyson went to work planning a grand gesture.\n\nJenna Spetz\n\n\u201cI wanted something silly to present\u2014I was thinking maybe a chicken nugget keychain or something like that, but definitely not all this!\u201d she added with a laugh.\n\nTyson brand initially offered to cater the entire wedding with chicken nuggets but couldn\u2019t find a caterer in time, and decided instead to have a toast with a bouquet made out of the bites. Sarnies, a local restaurant, offered to cook the nuggets and deliver them to the venue last weekend.\n\nThe CEO of Tyson also expressed congratulations to the happy couple in a message that was read aloud during Spetz\u2019s speech:\n\n\"We loved hearing from Jenna and knew we wanted to help her pull off an epic toast for her fun nugget-loving cousin. From the custom nugget bouquet, to a year\u2019s worth supply of nuggets, going all out for this dynamite couple was never a question. The entire Tyson Family is wishing them a lifetime of love, filled with lots of nuggets,\" the message said.\n\nSteuber Florist\n\nSpetz ended her speech by having all 280 guests \"raise their nuggets\" to the happy couple.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t know what to think,\" said bride Blair Tyson. \"I knew Jenna would pull off a good speech because she\u2019s funny like that, but I didn\u2019t expect this and I was completely mind blown!\"\n\n\"I thought it was so crazy and can\u2019t believe it actually happened,\" she added.\n\nTyson said the night was definitely memorable and she had a ton of fun posing with the bouquet (and an abundant amount of dipping sauces, of course) in photos with her husband who was also in on all of the action. The addition also fit well with the couple\u2019s wedding hashtag #Tysonschickennugget.", "description": "The bride has loved Tyson chicken nuggets since she was a kid.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gma-nuggets-191020_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
