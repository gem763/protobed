That update amused \u201cThe Hangman.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to fight who?\u201d Hooker told reporters, including MMA Junkie, with a laugh at the UFC 243 post-fight news conference. \u201cIf he wants to sit around chasing leprechauns, that\u2019s his own problem. If he wants a real fight and he\u2019ll take it, he knows where to find me.\u201d\n\nAfter beating Iaquinta on such a big stage, Hooker feels he\u2019s deserving of something big. Whether it\u2019s Poirier (25-6 MMA, 17-5 UFC) or another contender, he just wants an opportunity to move up and hopes it takes place on a main event stage.\n\nPrior to the decision victory, Hooker had finished all of his UFC opponents inside the distance. He looked fresh after three rounds against Iaquinta and said fighting the type of fight he did was a tactical decision.\n\n\u201cI feel I\u2019m a five-round fighter, so I wanted to take the full 15 minutes and really showcase it,\u201d Hooker said. \u201cI feel like if I had another two rounds I would\u2019ve stopped him, for sure, with another 10 minutes in there. I was picking him apart and would\u2019ve stopped him. I wanted to prove I\u2019m ready for a five-round fight.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just go blow these top-10 guys out of the water. These top-15 guys and unranked guys you can go out there and do this, but the skill level is so high you have to match that. I was out there. I wanted to prove I\u2019m ready for a five-round fight, ready for a main event for 25 minutes.\u201d\n\nDespite Poirier rejecting his callout, Hooker said he still has hope the fight will happen. He\u2019s looking to prove a point to his fellow lightweights, and part of that plan is to take out the same names as champion Khabib Nurmagomedov (28-0 MMA, 12-0 UFC).\n\n\u201cThis is the No. 6-ranked guy in the world who went from a title fight two fights ago,\u201d Hooker said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dustin is on my hit list. I wanted to follow Khabib\u2019s last two fights. I want to fight Al Iaquinta and then I want to fight Dustin and take him out.\u201d", "description": "Dan Hooker is ready for main event fights and top-ranked opponents at lightweight after beating Al Iaquinta at UFC 243.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Ken Hathaway", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Dave Doyle", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dan-hooker-ufc-243-post-fight-laugh.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
