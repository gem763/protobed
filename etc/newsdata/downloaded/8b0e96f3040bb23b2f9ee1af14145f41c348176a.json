In a relatively rare offer of public access to western media, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman showed up for an interview on 60 Minutes. Obviously, you can\u2019t have the Prince in the guest chair and not ask him about the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi so he was forced to address the question. What followed was one of the lamest cases of \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d for something terrible in television history. (Associated Press)\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a television interview that he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the grisly killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but he denied allegations that he ordered it. \u201cThis was a heinous crime,\u201d Prince Mohammed, 34, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in an interview that aired Sunday. \u201cBut I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\u201d Asked if he ordered the killing of Khashoggi, who had criticized him in columns for The Washington Post, Prince Mohammed replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d The slaying was \u201ca mistake,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA mistake?\u201d Did you really just describe a mafia-style snuff job and the cutting up of a human body with a bone saw a \u201cmistake?\u201d\n\nLeaving that aside for the moment, let\u2019s address the idea of MBS actually taking responsibility. Yes, he said the words, but he threw in a lot of caveats later that made the so-called admission essentially meaningless. The first was when he said he took full responsibility \u201cas a leader in Saudi Arabia\u201d and the murder was committed by \u201cindividuals working for the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nHe later follows that up by stating that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to know what the three million people who work for the Saudi government are up to on a daily basis. This explanation would make perfect sense if we were talking about a trash truck driver in Medina who accidentally ran over the Mayor\u2019s dog. But several of the people identified as (most likely) being Khashoggi\u2019s killers work directly for the Crown Prince as his personal staff and bodyguards. The idea that they were out there freelancing the killing of someone as well known as Khashoggi is laughable at best.\n\nOf course, when asked directly whether or not he ordered the killing, Prince Mohammed smoothly responded in the negative. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\nOf course not! Perish the thought. How rude of anyone to even ask.\n\nLook, we don\u2019t have the smoking gun (or sword) in this case, it\u2019s true. There\u2019s no video or audio definitively catching MBS giving the order to whack Khashoggi and we don\u2019t even know where the body is. We may never know, given that Saudi Arabia isn\u2019t exactly a model of open, transparent government. But the evidence is so overwhelming and the motives so obvious that I think we can sometimes be forgiven if we leap to conclusions.\n\nThis is one of the perils we face when we team up and build alliances with less enlightened, more brutal governments. Sadly, we deal with the world as it is, not as we might wish it to be. Take a look at the human rights record of China, for example. It\u2019s beyond abysmal, but they\u2019re still one of our largest trading partners and are treated with kid gloves in diplomatic circles. How much barabarism we tolerate from our friends generally depends on how much of our debt they hold. And Saudi Arabia is quickly climbing the list of those sorts of \u201callies\u201d in our stable.", "description": "Well... not really", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/88d37960-15a2-4d5f-844f-1d9dc5e3b582.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
