Once again, bitcoin has dropped below the $10,000 mark and is trading for just over $9,800. While this isn\u2019t a major fall, the currency seems to have wavered between this mark and $10,200 over the past month.\n\nMerten: Altcoins Are Making a Comeback\n\nMerten isn\u2019t concerned by this. In fact, he\u2019s looking to use the situation to his advantage, and advises others to do the same. As the host of YouTube\u2019s \u201cData Dash,\u201d arguably one of the most popular cryptocurrency channels on the streaming and video site, Merten claims that there are three specific cryptocurrencies that are likely to shoot up now that bitcoin is wavering if people are looking to invest.\n\nThose cryptocurrencies are Basic Attention Token (BAT), Raven Coin (RVN), and Chain Link (LINK). In a recent interview, he states that these three tokens are likely to grow heavily over the next 12 months, explaining:\n\nAt the current moment, looking at [bitcoin] market dominance, it does look like we\u2019re starting to enter into a trend shift where altcoins can start to gain as we retest back towards bitcoin\u2019s high of $20,000. The last two [altcoin cycles] that we had were at the end of the overall bitcoin cycle where bitcoin reached $20,000. The first one happened at the beginning of 2017 when bitcoin retested its high at $1,100.\n\nFor the most part, altcoins have had a relatively rough year in 2019. Bitcoin on the other hand, has experienced steady growth since April, doubling its price since then from $5,000 to about $10,000. While many have focused on bitcoin as of late, Merten says he\u2019s starting to see funds travel into smaller, competing coins.\n\nHe says:\n\nAs bitcoin does increase over time, as we tend to see a general growth in bitcoin\u2019s price, we tend to see more risk taking in different types of digital assets. As more liquidity has entered bitcoin, you have the ability now, through exchanges, for that liquidity to exit into other alternative investments. Sometimes, that can be rampant speculation, and in other cases, it can be driven through fundamentals. I believe this time around, in this cycle, we\u2019re going to see more going toward fundamental developed projects that actually have real demand.\n\nWhy These Three and Not Others?\n\nChain Link is big in that it\u2019s joined software company Oracle to help blockchains connect with outside networks. Raven Coin is significant because it allows developers to establish their own tokens, while BAT is moving forward in that it is attached to the Brave browser, which seeks to block advertisements and trackers from following one\u2019s searches and online activity.\n\nMerten is confident BAT will be very important in the field of privacy.", "description": "YouTube star Nicholas Merten says that three altcoins (Ravencoin, BAT and Chainlink) are likely to grow a lot over the next year.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2017/04/shutterstock_610504112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
