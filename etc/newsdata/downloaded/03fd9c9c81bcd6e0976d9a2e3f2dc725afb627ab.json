Swamp is attacking him \u2014 and we believe it is because he has been the most successful Chief of Staff in this administration to advance the Trump pro-America agenda,\u201d the memo states.\n\nThe memo, organized by the Conservative Action Project, will be signed by a number of prominent conservatives, including Club for Growth President David McIntosh, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, Heritage Action Executive Director Tim Chapman and Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, according to a conservative source involved in the effort.\n\nThe memo currently has more than four dozen signatories, and there is a deadline later Thursday for signatures, according to the source.\n\nThe memo describes Mulvaney, who represented South Carolina\u2019s 5th Congressional District, as a \u201ctrusted ally of the conservative movement\u201d as well as a \u201cproven leader, and an outspoken advocate of conservative principles and policies.\u201d It urges Trump to make Mulvaney his permanent chief of staff.\n\nThe memo also cheers Mulvaney for his work on key Trump administration initiatives, including crafting budget proposals that cut government spending as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), rebuilding the U.S. military and cutting taxes and regulations.\n\n\u201cHis attention, vision, and commitment to the president\u2019s policies has been evident from the beginning of the administration to today,\u201d the memo states.\n\nMulvaney, who has served as acting chief of staff since last December without Trump granting him the permanent title, is on shaky ground after a pair of public appearances that led to negative headlines for the White House.\n\nThose familiar with his standing in the White House have suggested his ouster is not imminent, but noted that some in the administration were unhappy with his recent comments. Mulvaney has also feuded in recent weeks with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, a central figure in the administration\u2019s impeachment defense.\n\nTrump has largely avoided answering questions about Mulvaney\u2019s status within the administration. A White House spokesman said this week that the president still has confidence in his acting chief of staff.\n\nMulvaney said at a press briefing last week that security aid to Ukraine was dependent partly on the country investigating a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nDemocrats seized on the comments, which undercut President Trump\u2019s insistence that there was no quid pro quo involved in withholding Ukrainian military assistance.\n\nMulvaney attempted to do damage control with an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d but struggled to clean up his remarks without causing new headaches.\n\nThe chief of staff said Trump \u201cstill considers himself to be in the hospitality business,\u201d a comment that raised eyebrows considering the widespread skepticism about the president\u2019s connections to his business empire.\n\nMulvaney described two conditions for holding up aid after he had listed three during the press briefing. Anchor Chris Wallace played video clips that contradicted Mulvaney\u2019s defenses of his Ukraine remarks, undermining his attempted defenses at times.\n\nAsked if he had offered to resign over last week\u2019s briefing, Mulvaney said he had not.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, positively not,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy working there.\u201d", "description": "A group of conservative leaders are telegraphing their support for President Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who has been under fire from some of the president\u2019s allies after public missteps.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mulvaney-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
