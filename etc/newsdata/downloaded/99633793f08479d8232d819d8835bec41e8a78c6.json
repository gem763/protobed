The Liverpool game is a great chance for us to go the other way,\u201d Solskjaer told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my nature to think of the best-case scenario. I know the fans and the players will be up for it.\n\n\u201cWe need to step up to the plate, and these are the big games that you sign up for at Man United \u2013 you have to show your quality.\u201d\n\nJurgen Klopp celebrated his fourth anniversary at Anfield earlier this week, but for all the German\u2019s achievements in transforming Liverpool\u2019s fortunes, he his yet to taste victory at Old Trafford.\n\nLiverpool have not won on their past six visits to United and left-back Andy Robertson warned that form will not count for much given the historical rivalry between the sides.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what your form is like in these games. It doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019ve won eight on the bounce and they\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s Man Utd v Liverpool,\u201d said the Scotland captain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely a different atmosphere when you play against them.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to United\u2019s misfortune, Liverpool have been handed an injury boost with the news Joel Matip is fit to return at centre-back, but Mohamed Salah remains a doubt after suffering an ankle injury in a 2-1 win over Leicester before the international break.\n\nDe Bruyne boost for City\n\nCity must bounce back to winning ways after a shock 2-0 home defeat to Wolves two weeks ago to at least apply some pressure on Liverpool when they visit Crystal Palace on Saturday.\n\nThe champions badly missed Kevin de Bruyne a fortnight ago and should have the Belgian international back from a groin strain as they look to become the first visiting side to win at Selhurst Park this season.\n\nCity have scored 25 goals in the six Premier League games De Bruyne has started this season, but been beaten in two matches he has not.\n\nPalace have confounded pre-season predictions to sit level with fourth-placed Leicester and Chelsea on 14 points.\n\nTottenham happy to welcome Watford\n\nThe international break may have come at the right time for Tottenham after a 3-0 thrashing at Brighton followed a humiliating 7-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.\n\nSpurs have won just three of their opening 11 games in all competitions, but the visit of Watford this weekend could offer some blessed relief for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men.\n\nThe Hornets are the only side yet to win in the league this season and sit rock bottom of the table having conceded 20 goals in their opening eight games.\n\n\u201cWe need to start believing in ourselves again. We have the quality in the squad and can fight for everything,\u201d said Pochettino.\n\n\u201cWe are still there, we have one point more than last season in the Champions League and we are three points from the top four.\u201d\n\nFixtures (all times GMT)\n\nSaturday\n\nEverton v West Ham (1130), Leicester v Burnley, Tottenham v Watford, Wolves v Southampton, Aston Villa v Brighton, Bournemouth v Norwich, Chelsea v Newcastle (all 1400), Crystal Palace v Manchester City (1630)\n\nSunday\n\nManchester United v Liverpool (1530)\n\nMonday\n\nSheffield United v Arsenal (1900)", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Liverpool can rub more salt into Manchester United wounds with a first victory at Old Trafford in five years on Sunday, while", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/20f3e5_liverpool-manager-jurgen-klopp-is-aiming-win-time-old-trafford-liverpool-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
