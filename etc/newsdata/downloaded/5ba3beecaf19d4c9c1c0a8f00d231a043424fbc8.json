It\u2019s mostly for children with special needs, there was no one there his age.\u2019\n\n\u2018For the last four to five weeks he\u2019s just been given presentations to go through.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no experts there he can ask questions to and sometimes he doesn\u2019t always have the materials he needs.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s sitting his Ethics GCSE this year, he\u2019s been at school for five weeks so far and he\u2019s still not had a lesson for that yet.\n\n\u2018He even not allowed to go at breaktimes and lunch with the other students. He has to go eat in the canteen on his own. All because he\u2019s got the wrong trousers.\n\nHis school said he wasn\u2019t isolated as other children were in the \u2018achievements centre\u2019 (Picture: Cambridge News/BPM MEDIA)\n\n\u2018Sadly the school seems his trousers are more important than his education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s coping really well, and I\u2019m really proud of him. He\u2019s seen all the emails and he knows what he is doing. But he also doesn\u2019t want to go into school.\n\nJess Phillips mulling run for Labour leadership if Corbyn loses next election\n\n\u2018He was just getting so fed up with it, and then he saw in the school rules that there was nothing against him wearing a skirt to school, so that\u2019s what he\u2019s done today.\n\n\u2018I actually started a petition when it started, and over 400 parents signed it but the school have not taken any notice of that.\n\nHe\u2019s had lots of support from others. I\u2019ve also made a formal complaint which is still being considered by the board of governors.\n\n\u2018My main point is that this uniform policy utterly is impossible to enforce. There are other children with the wrong uniform, but because we\u2019ve tried to stand up to them, he is getting discriminated against.\n\n\u2018The school should be talking to the wider community about these sorts of things rather than just making changes and then forcing people into accepting it.;\n\nLizz added that she was told other students had been protesting against Josh\u2019s treatment at school.\n\nKiller teenagers jailed over 'shocking and cruel' youth club stabbing\n\nA spokesman for the school said there had not been student protests, adding that Josh had now returned to normal lessons now was complying with the uniform code, albeit by wearing a skirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe school\u2019s principal, Jim Stavrou, added: \u2018Since the uniform changes were introduced, we have received much positive feedback, and many visitors, parents and staff have commented on how smart pupils look and the impression the uniform gives of the high standards at Swavesey Village College.\n\n\u2018We want nothing more than each student to receive the highest standard of education throughout their time at the college, but sadly a single case of defiant protest against the new policy has occurred.\n\n\u2018Any student who does not comply with the uniform policy continue to receive a high standard of education in the college\u2019s achievement support department with other students, but away from their year group. This involves individual tutoring, small group work with tutors and other students, as well as re-joining their year groups for PE.\n\n\u2018We also continue to offer different solutions to allow him to re-join lessons with his year group, including providing the uniform, but these options have been refused.\n\n\u2018As with all policies, we will conduct a review now that the uniform has been fully implemented. This will start this term and be completed within this academic year. All students will continue to wear our full uniform until this has been completed.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
