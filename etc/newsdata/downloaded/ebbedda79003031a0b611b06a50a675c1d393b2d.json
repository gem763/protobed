It would not say if it currently had any financial support from any source other than Facebook itself.\n\nSet up by Facebook to govern the Libra cryptocurrency, the Association was officially formed on 14 October, days after several high-profile payments firms abandoned the project, citing fears over security, and political pressure.\n\nNow the Association is in place, Facebook has said its influence is restricted as the other 20 members have an equal say over its actions. Facebook\u2019s David Marcus was elected as one of Libra\u2019s five board members. Members elected Bertrand Perez, formerly of PayPal, as Libra\u2019s chairman.\n\n\u2018China is moving quickly'\n\nBut Mr Zuckerberg has once again been summoned to the US capitol to address concerns from lawmakers over the potential for the Libra currency to be abused, or negatively disrupt the global financial order.\n\nAccording to the written testimony submitted to the House Financial Services committee, Mr Zuckerberg will say: \u201cWe want to be clear: Facebook will not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all regulators approve it.\n\n\"And we support [the Libra Association] delaying its launch until it has fully-addressed US regulatory concerns.\"\n\nThe statement would mark the first time the company has made an on-the-record pledge to lawmakers to only move ahead if US regulators are satisfied. The company had initially refused to rule out making that move when repeatedly pressed on the issue by the BBC in July, the last time Congress held a hearing to discuss the project.\n\nPoliticians in the US, as well as other countries, are concerned about Facebook\u2019s involvement, coming as it does after a sustained period of data privacy violations. But Mr Zuckerberg is expected to reiterate his view that if the firm is not allowed to press ahead with Libra, the US risked ceding power to China.\n\n\u201cWhile we debate these issues,\u201d he is expected to say, \u201cthe rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months.\u201d\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Facebook had said it hoped to launch Libra in 2020\n\nHe will add: \u201cIf American doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\u201d\n\nThe warning follows a speech the Facebook founder made in Washington DC last week, in which he criticised censorship on Chinese-owned app TikTok. \u201cIs that the internet that we want?\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Still a challenge'\n\nMr Zuckerberg is, however, aware that Facebook\u2019s reputational crisis is an obstacle Libra needs to overcome if it\u2019s to ever earn Washington\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cI understand we\u2019re not the ideal messenger right now,\u201d Mr Zuckerberg will say at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \"We\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I\u2019m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.\u201d\n\nUntil it achieves financial autonomy, the assertion that the Libra Association is an independent organisation will be put in question.\n\nOne source at a partner company told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Facebook start to move away from the Association a little bit, maybe, but it\u2019s still a challenge for them, definitely.\u201d\n\nLibra Association companies told the BBC that no timeline for implementing the $10m fee had been set - but all said they would likely invest in the project when asked.\n\n\u201cRather than collect a bunch of money from a bunch of people and then figure it out,\u201d one said, \"the feeling is that we needed to form, ratify a budget, and then figure out how to fund that budget, rather than the other way around.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
