Mr Woodford will also be removed from his position as the fund\u2019s investment manager with immediate effect.\n\nMr Woodford, one of Britain\u2019s best-known investment managers, was forced to freeze the fund after a run of poor performance scared investors into withdrawing their cash. That left the fund unable to sell off assets fast enough and at sufficiently high prices to meet further redemption requests.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAn unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.\n\nThe suspension was intended to give Mr Woodford time to change the composition of the portfolio to enable him to meet redemption requests.\n\n\u201cWhilst progress has been made in relation to repositioning the fund\u2019s portfolio, this has unfortunately not been sufficient,\u201d Link said.\n\n\u201cWe have therefore concluded that it is now in the best interests of all investors for the fund to be wound up by way of an orderly realisation of the fund\u2019s assets. This orderly realisation will allow the return of money through interim payments...to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nMr Woodford commented: \u201cThis was Link\u2019s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.\u201d\n\nSince Mr Woodford is no longer the manager of the fund, it will be renamed as LF Equity Income Fund.\n\nHundreds of thousands of savers still have money locked in the fund.", "description": "Neil Woodford\u2019s flagship fund, suspended since June, will be wound up and cash will be returned to investors \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d, its corporate director Link Asset Services has announced.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/08/neil-woodford-fund.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
