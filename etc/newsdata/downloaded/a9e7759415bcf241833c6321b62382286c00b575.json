Purchases will generally be made at the prevailing market price, although any purchases made by way of private agreement under an applicable exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority may be at a discount to the prevailing market price, as provided for in such exemption order.\n\nUnder the TSX rules, except pursuant to permitted exceptions, the number of Class B Shares purchased on the TSX on any given day will not exceed 355,530 Class B Shares, which is 25% of the average daily trading volume for the Class B Shares on the TSX during the six-month period ended September 30, 2019 of 1,422,123, calculated in accordance with the TSX rules. The actual number of Class B Shares to be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will generally be determined by Teck from time to time as market conditions warrant. In addition, Teck may from time to time repurchase Class B Shares under an automatic securities repurchase plan, which will enable purchases during times when Teck would typically not be permitted to purchase its shares due to regulatory or other reasons.\n\nTeck is making the normal course issuer bid because it believes that the market price of its Class B Shares may, from time to time, not reflect their underlying value and that the share buy-back program may provide value by reducing the number of shares outstanding at attractive prices. All repurchased shares will be cancelled.\n\nDuring Teck\u2019s previous normal course issuer bid, which commenced on October 10, 2018 and ended October 9, 2019, Teck purchased 22,466,152 Class B Shares on the open market at a volume weighted average price of $28.6921 per Class B Share. Teck sought and received approval to purchase up to 40 million Class B Shares under the previous normal course issuer bid.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Unites States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information as defined in the Securities Act (Ontario).
