The new season shines a spotlight on the battle over the future identity of Reno, Nevada, as the famously unruly city best known for gambling and quickie divorce attempts to reinvent itself as an offshoot of Silicon Valley.\n\nTo usher in a new Reno powered by tech giants like Tesla and Google, city boosters want to kick Reno\u2019s aging strip clubs out of downtown. Their main target is the Wild Orchid, a gaudy former hotel-casino in the heart of the bustling Midtown neighborhood. The strip club\u2019s owners, however, refuse to go quietly and many residents fear Reno is becoming not only unaffordable, but also unrecognizable without its vice.\n\nThe podcast features a robust cast of characters whose true stories illuminate the fight over Reno\u2019s future. That includes Kamy Keshmiri, Reno\u2019s strip club kingpin, who thinks the city he loves wants to put him out of business, and Stephanie, a stripper and single mom who stands to lose everything when she is caught up in the battle. Their stories and others illuminate how a changing Reno is impacting people without a seat at the table and raise broader questions around economic progress and growing inequality in American cities.\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s \u201cThe City,\u201d created by host and executive producer Robin Amer, premiered last year and was named one of the best podcasts of 2018 by The New York Times and Apple Podcasts. The first season traced the corruption and mob dealings that led to an illegal dump in Chicago's North Lawndale community. For the second season, Amer and \u201cThe City\u201d team collaborated with the Reno Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, and lead reporter Anjeanette Damon, to investigate the story of how power works in Reno.\n\n\u201cSeason 2 is about ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances. They\u2019re trying to save their homes, protect their livelihoods, and find their bearings as Reno changes around them. As unique as their stories are, in many ways this story is not unique to Reno. I think their voices will resonate at a time when so many American cities are changing and gentrifying,\u201d said Amer. \u201cI am excited and hopeful about the potential for Season 2 to have impact and spark dialogue as our cities weigh the costs and benefits of these changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success of the first season of \u2018The City\u2019 demonstrated that our audience is eager to engage with different forms of impactful storytelling. I cannot wait for listeners to engage with the incredible material included in the second season of this fantastic podcast,\u201d said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher of USA TODAY.\n\nThe first two episodes of the new season of \u201cThe City\u201d are available now at www.thecitypodcast.com, applepodcasts.com/thecity, and on all other major podcasting platforms. The rest of the six episodes will be released weekly on subsequent Tuesdays.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/10/29/season-2-looks-clashes-over-aging-strip-clubs-reno-nevada-city-transforms-into-offshoot-silicon-vall/2494178001/", "description": "Season 2 looks at the clashes over the aging strip clubs of Reno, Nevada, as the city transforms into an offshoot of Silicon Valley.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
