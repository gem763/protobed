Middle powers such as Australia have a fundamental national interest in a functioning international rules-based order. Great powers think, mistakenly, that they can advance their security and economic interests unilaterally. But that\u2019s not an option for the rest of us. Under successive governments, Australia has actively been in the business of helping set the rules of the international system. On security. On trade. On finance. On anything where we need the co-operation of others to solve problems we can\u2019t solve ourselves. And if we don\u2019t like the outcome, guess what? We don't have to sign or ratify.\n\nSo much for the conspiracy. Australia for three quarters of a century has been active in international institutions because it\u2019s been in our national interest to do so. What Morrison seeks to do in his speech is to erect a straw man argument about a threat to our national interests that simply doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt\u2019s throwing a big slab of red meat to the Duttonista far right, the Hansonites, and even certain Christian fundamentalists.\n\nSo what\u2019s Morrison really up to? The inconvenient truth is that it\u2019s not about foreign policy at all. It\u2019s about crude domestic politics. It\u2019s throwing a big slab of red meat to the Duttonista far right, the Hansonites, and even certain Christian fundamentalists who have long railed about the evils of \u201cone world government\u201d. And it\u2019s about wedging Labor.\n\nThe telltale line in Morrison\u2019s speech paraphrasing John Howard says it all: \u201cWe will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them.\u201d Whatever that means. Is he saying there are circumstances in which we won\u2019t pursue our national interests?\n\nBut Howard offers us a textbook example of what happens when you ignore international law and international institutions. Remember Iraq \u2013 the single greatest foreign and security policy disaster for Australia since Vietnam. We went to war in defiance of the UN Security Council, which just wanted UN weapons inspectors to finish examining whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But Howard knew best. The result: full-scale invasion but no WMD found; 200,000 to 600,000 innocent civilians killed; Iraq moves into Iran\u2019s sphere of influence; Iraq, where there were no terrorists before, becoming the breeding ground for a new terrorist movement, Islamic State; Baghdad almost falling to IS; a civil war in Syria where IS became a central combatant; millions of Syrian refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries and then to Europe, upending normal democratic politics, giving rise to the far right across the continent; and IS cells now across south-east Asia waiting to strike against soft Western targets.\n\nWell done, John Winston! That\u2019s what happens when you exhibit cavalier disregard for the international norms, rules and laws that Australia helped create in the first place. Something which Morrison should bear in mind in sending Australian forces off to the Gulf without any idea what the Trump administration may do next with Iran.\n\nOf course, Morrison\u2019s main domestic political agenda in his \u201cevils of globalism\u201d speech was climate. Morrison has been stung at home and abroad by the attacks on his government\u2019s record. He\u2019s smarting because the UN Secretary-General would not allow government leaders to address the UN climate summit unless they had added to their carbon reduction commitments. So ScoMo thought: why not attack the nasty globalists instead?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarbon commitments\n\nMorrison is struggling to meet his own modest carbon commitments under the Paris Agreement without resorting to dodgy accounting tricks. These were made as \u201cindependent national commitments\u201d, not mandated by international treaty. And they were commitments made by his government, not mine. No one forced them to do it. But now they are being held to account.\n\nGiven the massive impact of climate change on our economy and environment, it is fundamentally in Australia\u2019s national interest for a robust, measurable global agreement to reduce carbon. That\u2019s why Australia must play its part, rather than free-riding on the efforts of others. We must use our national credibility on climate to lead the international effort to keep temperature increases below 2 degrees. Otherwise we will bear the brunt of its full impact first. Indeed, in contrast to Morrison\u2019s anti-globalist thesis, active climate internationalism is directly in Australia\u2019s national interest.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the rank hypocrisy of the Liberals now railing against \u201cglobalism\u201d. After they had campaigned against our government\u2019s successful candidature for the UN Security Council, once in office you couldn\u2019t keep the Liberals away from New York. Tony Abbott included. Then there\u2019s the G20, which we helped create, with Australia for the first time having a seat at the top global table. But beyond the picfacs, where have the Liberals taken a substantive lead on the G20\u2019s global economic management and financial regulatory agenda? Remember Abbott at the Brisbane G20 summit? Our position has been squandered. So much for a greater role in \u201cglobal standard setting\u201d. The cry around the world today is: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to Australia?\u201d We\u2019ve become a little Australia.\n\nMorrison\u2019s speech follows the Liberals' long tradition of using foreign policy as the continuation of domestic politics by other means. We\u2019ve become a complacent country instead of confronting the major regional and global challenges that threaten our fundamental national interests. Australia deserves better.\n\nKevin Rudd is a former Labor prime minister and foreign minister of Australia.", "description": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison's speech railing against the international order offered no proof of the case he made against 'evil globalism'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8126%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_788%2C$y_114/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0ad3754438b6bc0c9e57b4aefffd806efd85715d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
