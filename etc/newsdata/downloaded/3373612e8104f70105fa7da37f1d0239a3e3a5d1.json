Their next Rugby World Cup opponent was, um \u2026 Canada?\n\nYes.\n\n\u201cOne game at a time,\u201d Coles said with a smile on Sunday.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t being cheeky. He\u2019d just spent two weeks focusing on the massive hurdle that was two-time champion South Africa, and getting over the Springboks 23-13 in Yokohama the night before was immensely satisfying though bruising.\n\nWith South Africa out of the way, defending champion New Zealand\u2019s campaign next goes through teams it hardly ever meets: Canada and Namibia.\n\nThe All Blacks haven\u2019t played Canada since the 2011 World Cup. They have won all five previous matchups, three at the World Cup.\n\nThey met Namibia their only time also at a World Cup, in 2015. The All Blacks put 58 points on the Namibians.\n\nWinning big again isn\u2019t on their minds, Coles said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s key for us that we give them the respect they deserve no matter who the team is,\u201d Coles said. \u201cThen it comes back to us about being All Blacks and preparing accordingly. If we can do that, give them respect then worry about us and represent ourselves and our country the right way, then we shouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d\n\nColes said just because those teams aren\u2019t in the top 10 in the rankings doesn\u2019t mean the wins will come easily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that we give them respect. They\u2019re at a World Cup and deserve to be at a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go in with a 50-50 attitude we won\u2019t have a proud performance. I\u2019m sure the whole team has the same motivation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see guys who didn\u2019t play last night given a chance. They\u2019ll want to go out and make their mark as well, create competition in the squad.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks have an 11-day turnaround before facing Canada on Oct. 6 in Oita, then only a four-day turn before meeting Namibia in Tokyo.\n\nThe short turn was put on the All Blacks and other leading teams by organizers after complaints at previous World Cups that Tier Two teams were sacrificed for the Tier One teams because they weren\u2019t given enough recovery time between matches.\n\nTier One teams had the squad depth to handle short turnarounds, but scheduling was still an issue. The All Blacks are playing four games in 21 days. Of its other Pool B mates, Namibia has 21 days, Italy 20, and South Africa and Canada 17 days each.\n\nCoach Steve Hansen said he will field all of his squad against Canada and Namibia, and some players may double up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where we control our own destiny with regard to where we\u2019re going to finish in this pool,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said we\u2019re having 10 days off but there\u2019ll be a lot of hard work out there which will allow us to put some miles in the bank so when we get to the quarterfinals, we can freshen up a bit.\u201d\n\nWhile there was a lot the All Blacks could improve on, Hansen and Coles were impressed by the team\u2019s defense against the Springboks.\n\n\u201cWe scrambled hard,\u201d Coles said. \u201cThey made some really good breaks and Rich (Mo\u2019unga) made an outstanding cover (tackle) on their winger. Just that willingness to get back and make that tackle, and never give up. That\u2019s promising for us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good start, but just a start.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All Blacks hooker Dane Coles paused.
