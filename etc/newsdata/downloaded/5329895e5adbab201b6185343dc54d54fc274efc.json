Teens who consider themselves to be climate activists are now on the horns of a dilemma. After Democrats managed to flip the state blue in the last elections, their new liberal governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, began pushing through all sorts of proposals. In addition to gun control and marijuana decriminalization, Grisham decided that all of the students in the state should get a free education at both two and four-year state colleges. What\u2019s not to like, right?\n\nWell, according to some teen activists, there\u2019s still a problem. You see, over the past nine years, the fracking boom in New Mexico has turned it into the third largest oil and gas producer in the country, behind only Texas and Alaska. And taxes from all of that energy production have left the state fat with cash to spend on things like public education. That\u2019s how Grisham is able to float plans like the free tuition scheme. But some of these students think it would be hypocritical to take the free money if it\u2019s got oil and gas stains on it. (NBC News)\n\nProponents of the bill say it would be a boon for a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest poverty rates and some of the country\u2019s worst-performing public schools. But critics, and some students like [Jonathon Juarez-Alonzo] \u2013 who stands to benefit from tuition-free college \u2013 see a conflict at the core of the governor\u2019s plan: free college would be funded largely through revenue from the state\u2019s ongoing oil and gas boom. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying we don\u2019t want or we don\u2019t support free public education,\u201d Jonathon said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a hostage situation where we have to choose free public education or a livable planet in the future.\u201d\n\nAnother student, fifteen-year-old climate activist Emese Nagy, of Albuquerque, was similarly conflicted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone to public school and I\u2019ve seen how bad our education is and how much funding we require,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nEven though the Democrats have taken control of both the legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion, the complaints of the climate activists are falling on deaf ears. Recently, State Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez introduced a bill that would have placed a moratorium of four years on all fracking activity so they could \u201cstudy the situation.\u201d It never even came up for a vote.\n\nThe fact is that New Mexico is currently doing financially better than the state has in ages. And it\u2019s almost entirely due to revolutionary new technology in the oil and gas exploration market. They\u2019re getting literally 32% of all their tax revenue from the fossil fuel industry. If they shut that off (the way New York State has), all of these programs the Democrats are using to give away free goodies will go up in smoke. And a little thing like \u201csaving the planet\u201d can\u2019t be allowed to get in the way of that.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a solution available to all of these students that addresses all of the problems above. Just don\u2019t take the money. Surely there is a way to opt out of the program and insist on paying the tuition. And if not, go to a private college. Or go to one out of state that doesn\u2019t offer free tuition. You have a variety of choices.\n\nNow, run along home and tell your parents that you need $100K they weren\u2019t planning on spending. And do come back and let us know how it goes.", "description": "Principles and pettiness", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/collegegrads.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
