Washington will play on Oct. 1, most likely against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great. Everyone wants to win. That is why we play,\u201d Nationals closer Daniel Hudson, who got the save, said in the raucous clubhouse. \u201cI am really glad to be part of this organization.\u201d\n\nHudson, acquired from the Toronto in late July, then took a break to share video with some of his family back in Arizona. He said his parents and friends were certainly watching on television in the Tidewater region of Virginia where he grew up.\n\nLefty starter Patrick Corbin said the team never lost confidence, even after being swept in four games at the New York Mets in late May, a result that had some fans wanting the Nationals to fire second-year manager Dave Martinez. Corbin signed a six-year deal with the Nationals prior to this season.\n\n\u201cGive credit to Davey. He believed in us,\u201d Corbin said.\n\nHowie Kendrick, a super-utility player hitting .344, is headed to the playoffs for the eighth time in a career that began in 2006.\n\n\u201cEveryone is special,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\nThe irony is the clincher came in a rare one-run victory. The Nationals are 17-21 in such games this year and 35-45 in two seasons under Martinez.\n\nThe clincher also came on a day that the bullpen had a strong performance. Five relievers combined for five scoreless innings in a win in the first game of the twinbill.\n\nIn the nightcap, reliever Hunter Strickland gave up a home run in the seventh to Bryce Harper, but Javy Guerra, also acquired midseason, and Hudson had lockdown innings to secure the win.\n\nWashington relievers had a league-worst ERA of 5.85 to begin the day.\n\nBut for a day, that was put aside.\n\nStanding just a few feet away to the entrance of the Nationals\u2018 clubhouse was Harper, the former Washington slugger who signed with Philadelphia as a free agent in March. He was catching up with some of his friends from his days in Washington.\n\nAbout 90 minutes earlier Harper hit the pinch-hit homer, cutting the Nationals lead to 6-5 and heightening the night\u2019s drama.\n\nBut it is the Nationals who are headed to the playoffs and not the Phillies, who were eliminated earlier in the day after Washington\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cIt feels good,\u201d catcher Kurt Suzuki said. \u201cIt feels really good.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
