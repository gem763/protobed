Fishburners doesn't think so\n\nON has trained over 1,440 researchers from 40 Australian universities and research institutes, in addition to 600 CSIRO staff.\n\nNearly 200 additional participants have come from outside of research, including industry, government, and the community, CSIRO said in a statement.\n\nThere have been 52 new companies created, resulting in 226 new jobs.\n\nAccording to CSIRO, over AU$30.4 million in commercialisation grants had been offered to ON participants, and 13 of the 52 new companies formed have raised over AU$36 million of investment capital.\n\n\"The ON program has made a significant and substantial difference to the culture of Australia's research community, and CSIRO will continue to support initiatives to drive returns for Australia from our world-class research,\" the organisation said.\n\nThe National Innovation and Science Agenda was announced by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in December 2015. The billion dollar promise was meant to incentivise Australian innovation and entrepreneurship, reward risk taking, and promote science, maths, and computing in schools.\n\nIn the wake of previous budget cuts by the Abbott government, Turnbull had given CSIRO AU$200 million to support co-investment in new spin-offs and startups.\n\nThe ON program, an initiative within CSIRO's 2020 Strategy was aimed at connecting the organisation with the Australian entrepreneurial community, was born out of the idea that the country has more than enough talent; it just requires the right environment and support.\n\n\"The ON program will be key to delivering more breakthrough innovation from CSIRO,\" ON program founder Liza Noonan said in late 2015.\n\n\"This program is different from other accelerators out there.\n\n\"These are deep tech projects that cross a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to agriculture. Our end goal is to get technology out to market that will address major challenges we face as a nation.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nData61 says Australia is still missing out on innovation opportunity\n\nInnovation is a AU$315 billion opportunity, and Data61 is still trying to convince Australia to take advantage of it.\n\nAustralian government stumps up AU$182m for help with its Entrepreneurs' Programme\n\nThe Department of Industry, Innovation, and Science is after approximately 10 delivery partners that can provide expert advice to help participating businesses grow, innovate, and commercialise.\n\nIndustry calls for joint participation to cement Australia's digital future\n\nThe Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering and the Australian Academy of Science have developed a strategic plan with 32 recommendations on how it can be done.", "description": "The program will expire alongside funding from Australia's National Innovation and Science Agenda.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/28/5cd65777-ee35-447e-86f0-890894ee847c/thumbnail/770x578/2bffc57eb0eec0a78a7c278f7732b0db/teamworkistock-538362390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
