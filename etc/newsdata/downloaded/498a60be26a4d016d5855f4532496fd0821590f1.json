On Sunday, the Kurds apparently struck a deal with the Syrian government, but its details \u2014 and what it would mean for detainees \u2014 were not yet clear.\n\nWho are the ISIS detainees?\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces has operated an archipelago of about half a dozen ad hoc wartime detention sites for captive ISIS fighters, ranging from former schoolhouses in towns like Ain Issa and Kobani to a former Syrian government prison at Hasaka.\n\nThe prisons hold about 11,000 men, of whom about 9,000 are locals \u2014 Syrians or Iraqis \u2014 and about 2,000 come from 50 other nations whose home governments have been reluctant to repatriate them. Scores of those men are Europeans, from countries like Belgium, Britain, France and Germany, but far more come from other nations that are part of the Muslim world, like Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen.\n\nThe Kurds also operate more than a dozen camps for families displaced by the conflict that hold tens of thousands of people, many of them non-Syrian wives and children of Islamic State fighters. These include the giant Al Hol camp about 25 miles southeast of Hasaka, where some 70,000 people have been living in increasingly dire conditions, and a camp in Ain Issa.", "description": "As the Turkish invasion leads to deteriorating security in northern Syria, the custody of about 11,000 captive ISIS fighters \u2014 and many thousands more detained ISIS women and children \u2014 is in doubt.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/us/politics/13dc-detainees1/merlin_152756715_bd9018d1-830d-4448-95f1-568d8c4a39e6-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
