But it took six months to come to terms with it and I worked through a lot of it during filming too.\u201d\n\nDirected by Irish-Thai filmmaker Tom Waller, the film is the first in what is expected to be a rollout of big- and small-screen treatments of the story that gripped the world for the 18 days the group was trapped underground.\n\nWarny had only just gone back to Ireland, to his partner and his day job as an electrician, when the calls started coming from filmmakers, TV producers and journalists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d returned home after completing the rescue and the pressure suddenly changed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost like more pressure than the actual event. But it\u2019s worked out OK in the end.\u201d\n\nWaller\u2019s film puts its focus more on the rescue effort than on the kids and the teacher who were trapped \u2014 more by necessity than design after those rescued signed deals tying them to a Netflix series in the works.\n\nReports say they were paid around $100,000 each and there is also a National Geographic documentary in the works from the team behind the Oscar-winning film Free Solo.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of detail of the rescue that the world hadn\u2019t really been told about, like the sedation of the kids and the background to the rescuers,\u201d said Waller.\n\n\u201cOnce I got in touch with Jim and met him all this started to be revealed and I saw how much more there was to the story that hadn\u2019t been told. Sure there was the rescue, but how? I wanted to tell the story of the people who weren\u2019t on YouTube.\u201d\n\nThat was impossible in Warny\u2019s case because once he came to Thailand he spent much of the time in the cave, under water. He\u2019d come to cave rescue diving after being drawn to the \u201ctechnicalities of it all.\u201d\n\nHe started as a support diver but ended up helping guide the sedated boys out, and carrying the teacher to safety himself.\n\n\u201cUsually when we get called out it\u2019s for body recovery,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut this time everything worked. It was a surreal experience when we held them. That they were all alive was incredible and a true testament to their bravery. I think it is a story that should just keep being told and this film helps do that.\u201d\n\nThe Cave is set for release in Thailand on November 28, with further international markets to follow.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The first movie centred around the cave rescue of 12 Thai schoolboy footballers and their coach made its world premiere on Saturday and there was one man in the audience for whom the experience proved as thrilling as it was nerve-shredding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cave.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
