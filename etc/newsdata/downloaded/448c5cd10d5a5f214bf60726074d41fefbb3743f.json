When Richard Nixon defeated McGovern in a landslide, even Nixon began planning for a U.S. withdrawal. \u201cPeace with honor\u201d was his slogan.\n\nThe late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden cited that withdrawal as evidence that the United States had no stomach for long wars. He believed the United States would grow weary from the \u201cwar on terror,\u201d ceding the killing field to the terrorists.\n\nNow comes President Trump with another promise for a unilateral withdrawal of \u201cbetween 50 and 100 troops\u201d from Syria. Many critics of the decision believe it is an invitation for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to slaughter Kurdish forces, America\u2019s loyal ally in the region in the fight against terrorism. The Kurds have served as a buffer, preventing an attack by Turkey\u2019s powerful military. Not surprisingly, it didn\u2019t take Turkey long to press its advantage. Reuters reports, \u201cTurkey\u2019s military struck the Syrian-Iraqi border to prevent Kurdish forces using the route to reinforce northeast Syria, as Ankara prepares to launch an offensive there after a surprise U.S. troop pullback.\u201d\n\nFollowing backlash, the White House appeared to reverse its Syria decision. An administration official, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said, the United States is not removing its forces from Syria in the face of a Turkish incursion. Which decision will ultimately prevail?\n\nBut Mr. Trump has gone further than announcing a unilateral withdrawal of forces, he has threatened Mr. Erdogan that if he attacks the Kurds and mistreats ISIS prisoners and does anything the president considers \u201cinhumane,\u201d \u201cthey could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Erdogan is an Islamist and it appears he\u2019s trying to take Turkey back to the days when it was an Islamic state. Does the president seriously believe Mr. Erdogan will bow to threats from one he likely considers an \u201cinfidel\u201d leader of the \u201cgreat Satan,\u201d as another Islamist state, Iran, has called us?\n\nThe president says he is merely fulfilling a campaign promise to stop involving America in \u201cendless wars.\u201d It is a noble pursuit, but just as it takes two to tango, it also takes two warring sides to declare a ceasefire, or peace. When only one side abandons the battlefield \u2014 and with terrorism the battlefield is everywhere \u2014 guess which side wins?\n\nEven some usually supportive Capitol Hill Republicans are critical of the president\u2019s decision because it betrays a lack of policy objectives in the region. No one knows, or can articulate, U.S. foreign policy anywhere. Another example: The administration supports the toppling of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, but it is no closer to achieving that stated goal.\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who was praised by President Trump for her service when she announced her resignation, has joined the growing chorus of people alarmed by the president\u2019s decision. Mrs. Haley, a potential presidential candidate in the near future, has said that the new U.S. policy toward the Kurds (if one can call it a policy) amounts to \u201cleaving them to die\u201d and is \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nYes, the Middle East is a snake pit and the United States has spent a lot of money over many years trying to kill off the \u201csnakes.\u201d But stopping the killing of those who want to kill us almost guarantees they will return to the battle with renewed resolve and new recruits. What will the unilateral withdrawers say then?\n\nComing home is no guarantee the terrorists won\u2019t come after us here. In fact, Iran has bragged of having their agents inside the United States, awaiting instructions to inflict more death and destruction.\n\nAmerica\u2019s withdrawal of troops from Vietnam ensured a Communist victory, but that war was more about nationalism than communism. This war is different.\n\nWhen he was president, George W. Bush said we are fighting terrorists over there, so we won\u2019t have to fight them here. Withdrawing troops and risking the destruction of the Kurds is a step too far.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
