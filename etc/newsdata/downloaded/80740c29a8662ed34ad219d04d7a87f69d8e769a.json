Don\u2019t push it \u2013 but don\u2019t forget about it either. Leave the invitation on the table and let them respond when the time is right CALL 0904 470 1167 (65p per minute)*\n\nSCORPIO 24 Oct-22 Nov Your fear of rejection means you don\u2019t always reveal your feelings, making rejection even more likely. You must break out of this vicious cycle, even if it means baring your soul to those you might not trust. Who knows, they may surprise you. CALL 0904 470 1168 (65p per minute)*\n\nSAGITTARIUS 23 Nov-21 Dec With Venus, planet of values, challenging Pluto this week, how you value a relationship will determine whether it succeeds. Is your valuation based on your feelings or on how much money it can make for you? The answer matters more than you realise. CALL 0904 470 1169 (65p per minute)*\n\nCAPRICORN 22 Dec-20 Jan You don\u2019t have to force your opinions on others. A little friendly persuasion is all it takes to get friends and colleagues to do whatever you want. As far as opponents and rivals go, don\u2019t be afraid to let them know you\u2019ve no intention of coming second. CALL 0904 470 1170 (65p per minute)*\n\nAQUARIUS 21 Jan-19 Feb Even if you are only 90 per cent certain that what you are doing is right, you must act as if you don\u2019t have the slightest of doubts. Others are looking to you to give them a lead and won\u2019t be impressed if you show signs of changing your mind. CALL 0904 470 1171 (65p per minute)*\n\nPISCES 20 Feb-20 March The world is full of tyrants: some big, some small, some serious, some silly. But all have the same basic flaw \u2013 they believe they\u2019re perfect. If you can\u2019t overcome a tyrant this week, you can still blow a hole in their ego \u2013 by pointing out how foolish they look. CALL 0904 470 1172 (65p per minute)*\n\nARIES 21 March-20 April Don\u2019t lose patience with loved ones just because you are under pressure in other areas of your life. Family and friends are doing their best, even if it\u2019s not always good enough. If you say something harsh this week, it will be difficult to take back. CALL 0904 470 1161 (65p per minute)*\n\nTAURUS 21 April-21 May Don\u2019t be suspicious if someone you don\u2019t always get along with offers to make your life easier this week. For once, there\u2019s no need to doubt their motives \u2013 they\u2019re just trying to be nice. Be nice back and, who knows, you could even become best friends. CALL 0904 470 1162 (65p per minute)*\n\nGEMINI 22 May-21 June No matter how hard you try to convince someone that you are right and they\u2019re wrong, you won\u2019t make much of an impression. Even if all the evidence is in your favour, they will ignore it. You might not agree with them but you may secretly admire them. CALL 0904 470 1163 (65p per minute)*\n\nCANCER 22 June-23 July You will suddenly realise this week just how little you know a certain person, even if you have been friends for years. What they say and do may shock you, but you still have no reason to complain. They\u2019re entitled to be different and you are not their keeper. CALL 0904 470 1164 (65p per minute)*\n\nLEO 24 July-23 Aug Work and social affairs will clash this week and you may have to cancel something you\u2019ve been planning for months. You\u2019re bound to be disappointed, but look on the bright side: you won\u2019t wake up with a hangover and worry about what you said or did. CALL 0904 470 1165 (65p per minute)*\n\nVIRGO 24 Aug-23 Sept You may not be the most forgiving of people: once your point of tolerance has been reached you can make a relentless foe. You will get the chance this week to heal a rift that goes back many years. Whether or not you take it remains to be seen.
