The Bugatti Centodieci will cost $9 million and only 10 will be made.\n\nThis car is an homage to the Bugatti EB110 supercar of the early 1990s. Centodieci means 110 in Italian. The EB110 was built in Northern Italy's \"Motor Valley,\" not far from where Lamborghini, Ferrari and Maseratis are made. It was an attempt to revive the Bugatti brand, which had been dormant since the 1950s. The Centodieci's design recalls the EB110s low, aggressive appearance.\n\nThat business ultimately failed, but the automobile it created is still regarded as one of the greatest supercars ever made. The prototype for the EB110 was designed by Carlo Gandini, the same man who designed the Lamborghini Countach. The final production versions of the car were designed by Giampaolo Benedini, who was also an avid racing driver.\n\nVolkswagen Group purchased the Bugatti brand name in 1998 and built its modern production facility at Bugatti's ancestral home in Molsheim, France. With the backing of one of the world's largest automakers, Bugatti now makes fast cars for the extremely wealthy , much as it did in the first decades of the 20th century.\n\nThe Centodieci is designed to be reminiscent of the wedge-like shape of the EB110 supercar of the early 1990s.\n\nUntil recently, the modern Bugatti factory produced only one car model at a time. The Veryon was offered from 2005 to 2015, with various changes and improvements made throughout its life. Then the Chiron entered production in 2016. Both cars were designed to be astonishingly fast but comfortable and easy to drive, thanks to massive turbocharged 16-cylinder engines mounted behind the two seats. When it was first introduced, the Bugatti Veyron cost about $1.5 million. The Bugatti Chiron costs more than $3 million.\n\nRead More", "description": "Bugatti unveiled its latest limited-edition model at a classic car show in California Friday.
