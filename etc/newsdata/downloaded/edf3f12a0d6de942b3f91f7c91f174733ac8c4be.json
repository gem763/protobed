Press pool reports from Sunday noted the presidential motorcade rolled out at around 10:50 p.m. and had been prepping to go since about 10:15 p.m., well before the game ended around 11:30 p.m.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blame Trump for ditching: Fans in D.C. went out of their way to show the president he wasn\u2019t welcome.\n\nTrump and his posse of fellow Republicans \u2014 which included first lady Melania Trump, adviser/daughter Ivanka Trump, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz \u2014 were shown on the Jumbotron at Nationals Park early on in the game. The crowd responded with loud, sustained booing that lasted until the camera cut away to a new group of people.\n\nBut the crowd didn\u2019t stop with boos. They co-opted his own cheer and got a good \u201cLock him up\u201d chant going.\n\nAnd still not done, later in the game a few fans unfurled multiple prominent banners with a simple message: \u201cImpeach Trump.\u201d Others held \u201cveterans for impeachment\u201d signs behind home plate, in plain view of the cameras.\n\nTrump had only hours earlier made the stunning announcement that U.S. military forces had killed the long-sought ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a daring raid, so he might have expected a warmer welcome. But the nation\u2019s capital is decidedly not Trump country: About 91 percent of D.C. voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Still it was remarkable to see such a negative reception for a president at the World Series.\n\nTrump had declined the high-profile opportunity to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game and arrived with little fanfare before being put on the big screen. Barring Trump, every president since 1910 has thrown out a first pitch, either for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or the World Series.\n\nThe president hasn\u2019t responded to the booing, but perhaps he\u2019ll take solace knowing it was a bad night for the D.C. fans as well. The Nationals lost 7-1.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump watches during the first inning of Game 5 of the MLB World Series between the Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, in Washington.
