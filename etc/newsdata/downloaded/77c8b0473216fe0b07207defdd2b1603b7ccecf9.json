Workers Begin to Size Up the Deal Their Union Is Selling", "language": "en", "text": "A rejection of the contract would be a major setback for the U.A.W. president, Doug Jones, and the union\u2019s other senior officials at a delicate moment. Before the strike, union leaders had come under heavy criticism from the rank and file over a federal corruption investigation in which several high-ranking officers have been charged with using union funds for lavish travel and personal purchases.\n\nMany union locals have started planning informational meetings to explain the terms of the contract to members. Darlene Maddox, who was laid off when the Lordstown factory closed this year and accepted a transfer to Lansing, Mich., said she was very disappointed that her old plant wouldn\u2019t be saved but wanted to know more before deciding how to vote.\n\n\u201cMy first instinct is to vote no,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the major highlights appear to be good.\u201d\n\nOthers said they were encouraged that temporary workers would be able to become permanent employees with full benefits after three years of service.\n\nUnder current rules, temporary workers earn about $15 an hour, can be laid off at any time and have no dental or vision insurance.\n\nLinda Castro, a temporary worker at a plant making sport utility vehicles in Spring Hill, Tenn., joined G.M. in January 2017, was laid off after a few months and more than a year later was recalled. She said she was worried that G.M. would lay off temporary workers before they could become full employees.", "description": "The tentative contract agreement includes a big investment in a Detroit plant that was scheduled to close.
