The review will consider opportunities for significant improvement, potential curtailments, closures or divestitures.\n\n\"It's also simply a way that we can make sure we have the right cash to help weather through the different parts of the market cycle,\" Mr Harvey said Wednesday. \"That is for us an important component of making sure we have the cash to be able to move through our restructuring process.\"\n\nAlcoa said it's implementing changes to make it leaner. The restructuring costs will be paid in cash in the fourth quarter 2019 with the remainder in the first quarter 2020, the company said. The new operating model is expected to generate annual savings of about $US60 million in operating costs beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe company reported a third-quarter loss of 44 cents a share, worse than analysts expected. Industrial metals have fallen as the US-China trade war weighs on global manufacturing and economic growth.\n\nGoldman Sachs lowered its price forecasts on aluminium earlier this month, citing strong supply growth outside of China and the negative impact of economic uncertainty on capital spending. Mr Harvey said the downturn may not last.\n\n\"When we think about 2020, we see demand springing back,\" Mr Harvey said. \"This isn't a problem with the consumption of aluminium, this is a hiccup with what's happening in the global economy that we believe will come roaring back once this uncertainty is behind us.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The world's biggest aluminium maker has outlined a plan to sell assets after its worst streak of quarterly losses in at least three years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.353%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e647ce7d660dd15ccd5adf4d2074cc063b3bee46", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
