It could happen all over the country.\u201d\n\nTexas has always been at the center of the abortion wars. Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, originated in the state. But this year, Texas didn\u2019t follow other Republican-held state legislatures in passing a \u201cheartbeat law\u201d that outlaws abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAD\n\nDismayed by the lack of state action, Dickson and other antiabortion activists are bringing their cause \u201cstraight to the people\u201d and lobbying town governments more adept at trash collection contracts than matters of constitutional law.\n\nNone of the new \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 most with a population under 3,000 \u2014 have abortion clinics, but Dickson\u2019s goal is to prevent health centers that perform the procedure from moving into Waskom, Joaquin and other towns that adopt the restriction. Dickson also hopes to attract a legal challenge that forces the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade.\n\nAD\n\nBut hundreds of miles west of these deep-red towns, another Texas city council is pushing the state\u2019s abortion politics in the opposite direction.\n\nAD\n\nMap: The nation\u2019s widening gap in abortion laws\n\nThe Austin City Council last month approved $150,000 for transportation, hotels and other costs for women seeking abortions, particularly those living in towns known as \u201cabortion deserts,\u201d places at least 100 miles away from an abortion facility.\n\n\u201cThe right to an abortion is meaningless if it is not accessible,\u201d said Aimee Arrambide, executive director of National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) Pro-Choice Texas. The antiabortion \u201cordinances are unconstitutional and illegal and meant to confuse people.\u201d\n\nOn his website, Dickson labels Austin a \u201ccity of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cAustin is going in the complete opposite direction of what we are doing,\u201d said Dickson, 34. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that little ol\u2019 Waskom is on the lips of the people of Austin. It\u2019s time for the smaller cities to start impacting the bigger.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn all-male council voted in Juneto make Waskom the first city to adopt the ordinance, which forbids Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and other \u201ccriminal organizations\u201d that offer or assist in obtaining abortions from operating in the city. It declares that providing money, transportation or other aid to a person for an abortion is unlawful, and allows would-be relatives of the unborn to sue those who do.\n\nThe ordinance is only criminally enforceable if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. But, in civil cases, Dickson said, local courts could enforce the ordinance in a lawsuit against someone who provides emergency contraception or performs an abortion in the town limits.\n\n\u201cThis is a gray area,\u201d said Greg Hutson, city manager of Gilmer, Tex., the most recent town to adopt the abortion ban. \u201cThis part could well be the vehicle that challenges Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWaskom, a town of about 2,200, sits on the Louisiana border, with the nearest abortion clinic about 20 miles away in Shreveport. Dickson, who calls abortion clinics the \u201cextermination camps of our day,\u201d describes himself as \u201ca fixture\u201d at the clinic, where he tries to convince women to \u201cstop the murder of your child.\u201d If a woman agrees, he takes her for a meal and buys a \u201cheartbeat bear,\u201d which plays a recording of the vibrations that become a heartbeat.\n\nDickson, pastor of Sovereign Love Church in Longview, Tex., also keeps a bear for himself, which he carries to town council meetings. Sporting a beard and a backward baseball cap, he plays the bear\u2019s \u201cwhump, whump\u201d recording for town leaders and makes the case for his abortion ban.\n\nSome of the smaller towns that Dickson has approached passed the ordinance without controversy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe majority of us don\u2019t want the blood of these babies on our hands,\u201d said Deborah Ramsey, Republican chair for Morris County, where the Omaha City Council unanimously passed the ordinance on Sept. 9. The neighboring town of Naplesdid the same in a 5-to-1 vote.\n\n\u201cIf we have to do it a town at a time, that\u2019s the way we are going to do it,\u201d Ramsey said.\n\nThe lone dissenting vote in Naples came from Councilman Danny Mills, who said he doesn\u2019t support abortion personally but thinks it should remain a personal choice.\n\nMills, who served several terms as mayor, said he felt blindsided by the ordinance and didn\u2019t like Dickson\u2019s \u201ctheatrics\u201d of the heartbeat bears.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe came into our town out of the clear blue sky,\u201d Mills said in a phone interview. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t see draining this tiny town\u2019s mayor and police tending to somebody else\u2019s private business to get an abortion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs Dickson has expanded the movement outside of East Texas and into larger towns, the ordinance has encountered more hurdles, including town attorneys concerned about potential legal fees.\n\nAbortion restrictions are costing states millions of dollars \u2014 in fees for the other side\n\nIn Mineral Wells, a city of 15,000 people about 80 miles west of Dallas, the council voted 5 to 2 against acting on the ordinance in July, at the recommendation of the city\u2019s legal staff.\n\nMost recently, the town of Gilmer \u2014 population 5,000 \u2014 voted 4 to 1 to adopt the ordinance, but only after removing several provisions, including the ban on emergency contraception and language that criminalized reproductive rights groups and classified abortion as murder.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of using the phrase \u201csanctuary city for the unborn,\u201d the council is calling its town \u201ca safe haven for the unborn,\u201d said Hutson, the Gilmer city manager.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPortions of his ordinance are inflammatory, throwing gasoline on the fire,\u201d said Hutson, who added that he\u2019s been unsettled by residents\u2019 hateful discord over the ordinance online. \u201cWe are a pro-life town. But for the sake of the country, the two sides have to come together and learn to talk about this in a kind way.\u201d\n\nMany of the town ordinances do not make exceptions for rape or incest, but all allow an abortion if the pregnancy \u201cplaces the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d And while they target anyone who helps a woman obtain an abortion within city limits, the ordinance holds that \u201cno punishment shall be imposed upon the mother of the pre-born child.\u201d\n\nThere have been no legal challenges yet, though the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas said its lawyers are reviewing the ordinances, calling them \u201cmisguided attempts by small towns to encroach on fundamental constitutional rights of women.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are keeping all options, including legal action, open as we investigate further,\u201d said Imelda Mejia, communications coordinator for the organization.\n\nIn response to the ordinance, abortion rights groups NARAL and the Lilith Fund have put up a billboard outside of Waskom proclaiming, \u201cAbortion is Freedom.\u201d\n\nAmanda Beatriz Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund, which provides financial assistance to women seeking abortions, said the abortion-ban ordinance \u201cis just an illegal and wacky strategy that shows the desperation of the antiabortion movement.\u201d\n\nShe attended a hearing in Austin at which Dickson played the teddy-bear heartbeats. His abortion-ban ordinance lists the Lilith Fund as a \u201ccriminal organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about shaming and manipulating women,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe will be fighting these bans in every town. We won\u2019t stop.\u201d", "description": "The abortion ban is encountering more hurdles as activists target larger Texas cities.", "authors": ["Emily Wax-Thibodeaux", "National Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Social Movements."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BAzyJS25ohl0znHutiE6lrMy_QY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PFERVBFP5II6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
