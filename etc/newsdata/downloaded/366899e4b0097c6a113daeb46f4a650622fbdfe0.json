Or things that I'm not just asked to do or really that interested in living in a green screen.'\n\nMarvel fans were quick to attack the actress for claiming Marvel diminished the quality of movies produced every year.\n\nAnd the comments turned ugly quickly with people pointing out the movies Jennifer has starred in recently.\n\n'I can accept Martin Scorsese criticizing Marvel movies, but Jennifer Aniston saying they are \"diminishing\" cinema... Really, sis? With your movie record. Lol,' one commenter wrote.\n\nThe commenter then shared a list of Jennifer's movies with the Rotten Tomato rating next to them.\n\nWhat was also mentioned was how Martin Scorsese, the Academy Award-winning director, slammed the Marvel franchise in recent days. For the commenter, this critique was allowed given Martin's status in the industry.\n\nHarsh comments: Jennifer said she thought the movies were +'diminishing' the experience, which many fans did not agree\n\nEmpire 'I don't see them. I tried, you know? But that's not cinema,' Martin toldmagazine about the Marvel movies.\n\n'Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.'\n\nMartin also faced backlash, but a majority of people were focusing on Jennifer's comments about the franchise.\n\nAnother commenter wrote: 'Jennifer Aniston\u2019s highest grossing movie is Bruce Almighty. I\u2019d be mad at Marvel movies too lmao.'\n\nThese comments kept pouring in with insults about Jennifer's recent choices in movies to star in.\n\n'Jennifer Aniston says Marvel movies are \"diminishing\" the movie experience, but the last movie I saw her in was a terrible Adam Sandler movie on Netflix so....,' the commenter wrote, referencing the movie Murder Mystery.\n\nMultiple commenters brought up Adam Sandler and his movies, which Jennifer will often co-star in alongside the actor.\n\nBack to TV: She said the current the state of movies, and the quality of streaming services, inspired her return to TV to star in the Apple TV+ series The Morning Show\n\nSupportive: But there were a number of fans who agreed with Jennifer's comments about Marvel and the state of the movie industry\n\nExplanation: One movie-goer detailed how Marvel movies can control the box office\n\n'I love her, but it's not like 5000 Adam Sandler movies with her, and Kevin James as different characters would \"improve\" the film industry,' the person tweeted. 'It's called entertainment for a reason. Marvel movies, Adam Sandler movies, they're all entertaining, but hardly cinematic masterpieces.'\n\nBut there were a number of people who stood up for Jennifer and her comments about Marvel.\n\nMentioning Jennifer's Friends character, one person wrote: 'Jennifer aniston could do any marvel character but no mcu actor could do rachel green.'\n\nMovie-goers also defended Jennifer's response by saying they felt the film experience has declined because of how much Marvel movies can monopolize the box office.\n\n'But those other movies get crushed by these movies. THAT's the point. Studios like Disney release MCU movies every month and crush the competition every time,' a frustrated commenter wrote.\n\nJennifer probably did not anticipate her comments to blow up like they did when speaking to Variety.\n\nShe was also unafraid to comment on the growing streaming industry by saying it was 'kind of sad' that time-specific television experience was disappearing.\n\n'I'm shocked this is where we are, but excited that this is where we are. I didn't see it coming. I remember not understanding. What the hell does streaming mean? They're like, it's there all the time,' she said.", "description": "The actress, 50, spoke to Variety about her return to television screens.
