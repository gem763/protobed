On a year-over-year basis, the shortfall with China is $231.6 billion, an 11.4% decline from the same period in 2018.\n\nThe deficit with Germany swelled to $7.1 billion, the highest on record thanks to $12.1 billion of imports, also a record.\n\nWith additional tariffs about to take effect against the EU, the trade gap also closed across much the region.\n\nThe EU deficit fell 23.7% from August though it is up 8.1% from a year ago. The U.S. also is threatening to add duties against the $300 billion of Chinese goods not already subject to tariffs.\n\nOn a goods basis, auto exports grew $14.3 billion and hit their highest level since July 2014. The petroleum deficit of $300 million was the lowest on record.\n\nExports of capital goods, though, hit $44.3 billion, the lowest since October 2017.", "description": "The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in August thanks in part to a record level of imports of consumer goods.
