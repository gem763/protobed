The one out MLS player, Mr. [Collin] Martin, and the countless other female out LGBTQ players who fight so hard every day just to play the sport that they love, but be also fight the rampant homophobia that we have.\n\nLionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe with their The Best FIFA awards.\n\n\"Those are all the stories that inspire me so much. But they also admittedly make me a little bit sad and a little bit disappointed.\"\n\nSterling has become a leader and the face of the fight against racism in English football and has arguably done more than anybody else in Britain to promote racial discourse.\n\nAfter being racially abused by Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge in December 2018, he uploaded a post to Instagram highlighting the difference in the way the media speaks about young black players and white players\n\nKoulibaly also used social media to denounce racism after he was subjected to monkey chants against Inter Milan in December last year, writing: \"I am proud of the color of my skin. Proud to be French, Senegalese, Neapolitan: a man.\"\n\nRaheem Sterling celebrates in the direction of Montenegro fans after being racially abused.\n\nHowever, Rapinoe said that it shouldn't be just down to those individuals to fight alone.\n\n\"I feel like if we really want to have meaningful change, what I think is most inspiring would be if everybody other than Raheem Sterling and Koulibaly were as outraged about racism as they were,\" Rapinoe said.\n\n\"If everybody else was as outraged about homophobia, as the LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about equal pay, or the lack thereof, or the lack of investment in the women's game other than just women.\n\n\"That would be the most inspiring thing to me. I feel like that's my ask of everybody, we have such an incredible opportunity being professional football players.\n\n\"We have so much success, financial and otherwise, we have incredible platforms. I asked everyone here, because I think everyone in this room has that crown that they're bearing, lend your platform to other people, lift other people up, share your success.\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity in football, different to any other sport in the world, to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. So that's my charge to everyone. I hope you take that to heart and just do something, do anything. We have incredible power in this room.\"\n\nAward winners\n\nElsewhere, Lionel Messi edged out Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to be crowned The Best FIFA Men's Player, while Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and USWNT boss Jill Ellis were crowned The Best FIFA Coaches.\n\nKlopp used his win to announce he would be joining Common Goal by pledging 1% of his salary to organizations that use football to help create social change.", "description": "USWNT star Megan Rapinoe praised Raheem Sterling for his continuing fight against racism and urged those in the room to use their platform as worldwide stars for good in her acceptance speech for The Best FIFA Women's Player of the Year award.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924101745-rapinoe-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
