Using twin bass drums, Baker fashioned a pounding, poly-rhythmic style uncommonly swift and heavy that inspired and intimidated countless musicians. But every beat seemed to mirror an offstage eruption \u2014 whether his violent dislike of Cream bandmate Jack Bruce or his on-camera assault of a documentary maker, Jay Bulger, whom he smashed in the nose with his walking stick.\n\nBulger would call the film, released in 2012, \u201cBeware of Mr. Baker.\u201d\n\nWhile the Rolling Stone magazine once ranked him the third-greatest rock drummer of all time, behind Moon and Bonham, Baker had contempt for Moon and others he dismissed as \u201cbashers\u201d without style or background. Baker and his many admirers saw him as a rounded, sophisticated musician \u2014 an arranger, composer and student of the craft absorbing sounds from around the world. He had been playing jazz since he was a teenager and spent years in Africa in the 1970s, forming a close friendship with the Nigerian musician-activist Fela Kuti.\n\n\u201cHe was so unique and had such a distinctive personality,\u201d Stewart Copeland of the Police told www.musicradar.com in 2013. \u201cNobody else followed in his footsteps. Everybody tried to be John Bonham and copy his licks, but it\u2019s rare that you hear anybody doing the Ginger Baker thing.\u201d\n\nBut many fans thought of him as a rock star, who teamed with Eric Clapton and Bruce in the mid-1960s to become Cream \u2014 one of the first supergroups and first power trios. All three were known individually in the London blues scene and together they helped make rock history by elevating instrumental prowess above the songs themselves, even as they had hits with \u201cSunshine of Your Love,\u201d \u201dI Feel Free\u201d and \u201cWhite Room.\u201d\n\nCream was among the most successful acts of its time, selling more than 10 million records. But by 1968 Baker and Bruce had worn each other out and even Clapton had tired of their deafening, marathon jams, including the Baker showcase \u201cToad,\u201d one of rock\u2019s first extended drum solos. Cream split up at the end of the year, departing with two sold-out shows at London\u2019s Albert Hall. When told by Bulger that he was a founding father of heavy metal, Baker snarled that the genre \u201cshould have been aborted.\u201d\n\nTo the surprise of many, especially Clapton, he and Baker were soon part of another super group, Blind Faith, which also featured singer-keyboardist Stevie Winwood and bassist Ric Grech.\n\nAs Clapton would recall, he and Winwood had been playing informally when Baker turned up (Baker would allege that Clapton invited him). Named Blind Faith by a rueful Clapton, the band was overwhelmed by expectations from the moment it debuted in June 1969 before some 100,000 at a concert in London\u2019s Hyde Park. It split up after completing just one, self-titled album, as notable for its cover photo of a topless young girl as for its music. A highlight from the record: Baker\u2019s cymbal splashes on Winwood\u2019s lyrical ballad \u201cCan\u2019t Find My Way Home.\u201d\n\nFrom the 1970s on, Baker was ever more unpredictable. He moved to Nigeria, took up polo, drove a Land Rover across the Sahara, lived on a ranch in South Africa, divorced his first wife and married three more times.\n\nHe recorded with Kuti and other Nigerians, jammed with Art Blakey, Elvin Jones and other jazz drummers and played with John Lydon\u2019s Public Image Ltd. He founded Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force, which cost a fortune and imploded after two albums. He endured his old enemy, Bruce, when Cream was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and for Cream reunion concerts a decade later. Bruce died in 2014.\n\nBaker continued to perform regularly in his 70s despite arthritis, heart trouble, hearing loss dating from his years with Cream and lung disease from smoking. No strangers to vices and not a fan of modesty, he called his memoir \u201cHellraiser: The Autobiography of the World\u2019s Greatest Drummer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Bonham once made a statement that there were only two drummers in British rock \u2018n\u2019 roll; himself and Ginger Baker,\u201d Baker wrote in his book. \u201cMy reaction to this was, \u2018You cheeky little bastard!'\u201d\n\nBorn in 1939, Peter Edward Baker was the son of a bricklayer killed during World War II when Ginger was just 4. His father left behind a letter that Ginger Baker would quote from: \u201cUse your fists; they\u2019re your best pals so often.\u201d\n\nBaker was a drummer from early on, even rapping out rhythms on his school desk as he mimicked the big band music he loved and didn\u2019t let the occasional caning from a teacher deter him. As a teenager, he was playing in local groups and was mentored by percussionist Phil Seamen.\n\n\u201cAt this party, there was a little band and all the kids chanted at me, \u2018Play the drums!\u201d\u2019, Baker told The Independent in 2009. \u201cI\u2019d never sat behind a kit before, but I sat down \u2014 and I could play! One of the musicians turned round and said, \u2018Bloody hell, we\u2019ve got a drummer\u2019, and I thought, \u2018Bloody hell, I\u2019m a drummer.'\u201d\n\nBaker came of age just as London was learning the blues, with such future superstars as Clapton, Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page among the pioneers. Baker joined Alexis Korner\u2019s Blues Incorporated, where he met (and soon disliked, for allegedly playing too loud) the Scottish-born bassist Jack Bruce, with whom he was thrown together again as members of the popular British group the Graham Bond Organization.\n\nClapton, meanwhile, was London\u2019s hottest guitarist, thanks to his work with the Yardbirds and John Mayall\u2019s Blues Breakers, his extraordinary speed and agility inspiring \u201cClapton is God\u201d graffiti. Clapton, Baker and Bruce would call their band Cream because they considered themselves the best musicians around.\n\n\u201cOh for god\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve never played rock,\u201d Baker told the blog JazzWax in 2013. \u201cCream was two jazz players and a blues guitarist playing improvised music. We never played the same thing two nights running. Jack and I had been in jazz bands for years. All that stuff I did on the drums in Cream didn\u2019t come from drugs, either. It was from me. It was jazz.\u201d", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Ginger Baker, the volatile and propulsive British musician who was best known for his time with the power trio Cream, has died at 80, his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/02bbf9_britain-obit-ginger-baker-16915-in-sunday-dec-2008-file-photo-british-musician-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
