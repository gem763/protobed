In 48 hours time, I think you will see a very collective effort and that effort will make us tough to beat,\u201d the New Zealander told a news conference on Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge amount between the two teams and so whoever does maybe get the bounce of the ball or can be just a little bit more efficient than the other, it may just tip the balance.\u201d\n\nSchmidt has only lost once in seven meetings against the Scots, often running out decent winners, but their free-flowing fellow Celts have troubled Ireland at times and Gregor Townsend\u2019s men may sense an opportunity.\n\nIreland\u2019s patchy form has sharpened their focus on just navigating Pool A, before dreaming once more about reaching a first ever World Cup semi-final.\n\nThe absence of Ireland\u2019s Rob Kearney, Keith Earls and Robbie Henshaw has only added to their difficulties and Townsend duly picked a team loaded with experience that will need flyhalf Finn Russell at his best if they are to upset the world number one ranked team.\n\nA Scotland victory could make Pool A very interesting with hosts Japan and even Samoa keen to spoil someone\u2019s tournament.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that through the way they have trained and acted in the last few days. It has been two of our best ever training sessions and that excites you as a coach,\u201d Townsend said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your opening game of the World Cup and you are playing a team that are currently ranked number one in the world. It is a hugely important game against a very good side.\u201d", "description": "Ireland will be desperate to put a disappointing year behind them in Sunday's World Cup opener against a dangerous Scotland side with coach Joe Schmidt adamant his team will show the rest of the competition just how tough they will be to get past.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431974359&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J11W", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
