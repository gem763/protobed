He's on the side and he's bouncing around, he wants to be out there. That energy's big for us when we're down.\n\n'He seems to judge it right, when to put an arm round the shoulder after a game. If we haven't played well or something, he knows what to say at half-time, or if you need a rocket he'll give you that as well. He seems to judge those situations very well.'", "description": "Milner says the German manager has found the perfect balance between knowing when to put arm round the shoulder and when to give the players a rocket.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/11/19687744-0-image-a-27_1571049600181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
