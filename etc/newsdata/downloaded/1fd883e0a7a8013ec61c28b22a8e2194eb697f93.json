When we get that right, we can definitely topple a lot of teams.\n\n\u201cDespite the loss, there were a lot of things that went right. We had a good performance with our setpieces being sharp and good attack. We had a few skills errors that let us down and a few calls that didn\u2019t go our way, but most things went well.\u201d\n\nThe Southern Kings will next face Ulster in a PRO14 Round 3 clash at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday, 12 October.\n\n\u201cOur preparations for the Ulster game start tomorrow already,\u201d said Badiyana\n\n\u201cWe have this one more game at home before we go on tour, so we are definitely out to get that first win here at home. We just need to get that last 20 or so minutes right, and we\u2019ll get good results.\u201d\n\n- Southern Kings", "description": "Irish visiting side, Munster, claimed a win over the Southern Kings in a tough PRO14 Round 2 clash at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/2373b08662d14c3fb26a436398b7fbaf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
