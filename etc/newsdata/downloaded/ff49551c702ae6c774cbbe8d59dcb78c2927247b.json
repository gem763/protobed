(Oct. 22) AP\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Actress Alexis Bledel has been bookish and sweet on \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\" But the actress herself is now officially dangerous.\n\nCybersecurity firm McAfee on Monday crowned Bledel the most dangerous celebrity on the internet in 2019. No other celebrity was more likely to land users on websites that carry viruses or malware.\n\nTrailing Bledel at No. 2 is talk show host James Corden, followed by \"Game of Thrones\" star Sophie Turner, actress Anna Kendrick, movie star Lupita Nyong'o, talk show star Jimmy Fallon, martial arts master Jackie Chan, the rappers Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj, and finally Marvel actress Tessa Thompson at No. 10.\n\nThe survey is meant to highlight the danger of clicking on suspicious links. Bad actors will attach malware and malicious links to famous names, hoping fans searching for videos on the internet will fall victim. McAfee urges internet users to consider risks associated with searching for pirated content and always apply updated security fixes.\n\nThe robot invasion has begun: Meet the computer-generated influencers taking over Instagram\n\nThink twice the next time you stream something with Alex Bledel.

Lil Wayne's summer tour with Blink-182 may have prompted fans to search for illegal downloads.\n\nThe second most dangerous celebrity to search online, behind Alexis Bledel, is comedian James Corden, due to viral videos from his late night show.

This year's list also indicates interest in reality stars may have waned. Kristen Cavallari and Kourtney Kardashian, who both found themselves in last year's top 10 list, dropped to No. 214 and No. 222, respectively.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/most-dangerous-celebs-web-alexis-bledel-james-corden-and-more/4059992002/", "description": "According to cybersecurity firm McAfee, Sophie Turner and Lupita Nyong'o are just some of the celebs you need to watch out for on the web this year.", "authors": ["Mark Kennedy", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
