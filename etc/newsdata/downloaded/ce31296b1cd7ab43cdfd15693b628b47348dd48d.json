She has no regrets.\"\n\nRumours of the duo's split first started circulating after eagle-eyed fans noticed the couple haven't been pictured together since May.\n\nTheir on/off romance has hit the headlines over the years.\n\nThey broke up in 2014, and John dated Christie Brinkley before reconciling with Meg later in the year, but they eventually cooled things off again in 2015.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe two reunited once again in 2017, before getting engaged in November 2018.\n\nThe Sleepless In Seattle star announced their engagement in an Instagram post with a sketch of the pair with the caption, 'ENGAGED.'\n\nApparently geography was to blame for their previous splits as they struggled with the distance between them - Meg lived in New York while John was based over 700 miles away in Indiana.\n\nIn 2013, John admitted he wasn't a fan of the Big Apple: \"I'm too sensitive to live here. I can\u2019t see poor people. I can\u2019t see suffering. I can\u2019t see the trash on the streets.\"\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\nHer cancelled engagement would have been a second marriage for former America's Sweetheart Meg, who divorced Dennis Quaid in 2001.\n\nThe When Harry Met Sally star and Dennis were married for 10 years, but their relationship broke down when she had an affair with Russell Crowe on set of The Proof Of Life.\n\nMeanwhile, John is a seasoned pro at marriage, having been divorced three times.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nMeg - who got her break in 1986's Top Gun - has a son Jack, 27, with Dennis and an adopted daughter Daisy, 15, while John has five children from his three marriages.\n\nHe is father to daughters Michelle, 48, with Esterline; Teddi, 37, and Justice, 33, with Granucci; and with Irwin, sons Hud, 25, and Speck, 24.\n\nMirror Online has contacted Meg's reps for comment.", "description": "The couple have reportedly called it quits on their relationship and broke off their engagement", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Getty Images", "Filmmagic", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20759355.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Celebrities-Attend-The-New-York-Knicks-Vs-Philadelphia-76ers-Game.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
