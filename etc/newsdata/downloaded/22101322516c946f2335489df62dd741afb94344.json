John Cornyn (R-Tex.) at the White House in 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWith one exception, Senate Republicans are standing by President Trump, who is facing allegations he pressured Ukraine to dig into his potential 2020 opponent.\n\nThey could regret that.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what is in the whistleblower complaint centered on Trump and Ukraine, but since news of its existence and some of its contents started surfacing last week, it has consistently suggested the worst for Trump.\n\nConsider: After reports that the complaint centered on a \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader, we learned it involved Ukraine, a country Trump has political ties to through his former campaign head Paul Manafort.\n\nWe then learned that Trump was said to have pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family of former vice president Joe Biden, whose son served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The Wall Street Journal reported Trump brought up Biden and his son eight times in the call with Zelensky.\n\nAfter we learned all that, Trump didn\u2019t deny he brought up Biden in the call, though he maintains he did nothing wrong. On Monday, he said he did not make military aid conditional on Ukraine investigating Biden and his family.\n\nAnd now we learned through The Washington Post on Monday night that Trump stopped military aid to Ukraine (aid even Republicans in Congress wanted to go to the country) a week before he made the call and apparently talked about Biden.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s a legitimate explanation for all this. A senior administration official told The Post that holding up the military aid \u201chad nothing to do with a quid pro quo\u201d and that Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine.\n\nTrump himself confirmed Tuesday that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, but he gave a different explanation: He said it was over his concerns that the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries were.\n\n[Trump confirms he withheld military aid from Ukraine, says he wants other countries to help pay]\n\nMaybe what Trump did was unethical, but not outright illegal or impeachable. Splitting that difference is how Republicans stood by him after the release of the Mueller report, which found Trump\u2019s campaign welcomed Russia\u2019s help but didn\u2019t actively collude with it to win the 2016 election.\n\nOn that thin line is where Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) balances. He told The Post\u2019s congressional team Monday: \u201cHe simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don\u2019t believe he should have done it. But that in and of itself is not an impeachable offense, as some people claim. Now, the second thing you raise, [a quid pro quo], he denies, and so do the Ukrainians. If alternative information emerges, we have a different set of circumstances, but that\u2019s not before us right now.\u201d\n\nBut other Senate Republicans are being less circumspect and doing their best to defend Trump when they don\u2019t really know what he did.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who is up for reelection this year, cast aspersions on the whistleblower, whose allegations were deemed credible by a Trump-appointed watchdog in the intelligence agency. \u201cWhat makes you think he is [a whistleblower]?\u201d Cornyn asked, as The Post\u2019s Felicia Sonmez, Mike DeBonis and Erica Werner reported.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), a former Trump critic who recently got Trump's endorsement in a primary, simply said: \u201cI'm not doing any interviews right now.\u201d\n\nOthers are trying to focus on what Biden may or may have not done, but the facts to allege wrongdoing just don\u2019t seem to be there.\n\nThen there were the straight-up defenders of Trump.\n\n\u201cI believe that President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt, \u201cbecause I think he did nothing wrong, and he has nothing to hide.\"\n\nMaybe Trump has nothing to hide. Maybe we already known the worst of the story, and at the very least, it\u2019s spinnable for Republicans. (We wish he didn\u2019t bring up his reelection on a diplomatic call, but the president should have the prerogative to talk to foreign leaders how he wants, or something like that.) That seems to be the pattern for most of Trump\u2019s scandals. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) even defended Trump after he tweeted that four minority members of Congress, all U.S. citizens, should \u201cgo back.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s also the possibility Trump did something indefensible, and that it eventually comes out. That\u2019s the gamble most Senate Republicans are taking right now.", "description": "Maybe Trump has nothing to hide on Ukraine.
