The idea is to protect borrowers from taking on more debt than they can handle and ensure they have some financial leeway if rates rise.\n\nThe Conservatives are promising to review the application of the test for new buyers and eliminate it altogether from mortgage renewals.\n\nScheer said the test goes too far and has unintended consequences.\n\n\"A new Conservative government will fix the stress test to make sure first time homebuyers can get access to a mortgage,\" he said while unveiling a housing plan during a campaign stop in Vaughn, Ont. Monday.\n\nCIBC published a report earlier this year calling for a review of the stress test. In 2018, the total value of new mortgages fell by eight per cent, or $25 billion, it said. The report estimates the impact of the new stress test accounted for $13 billion to $15 billion of that drop \u2014 or 50 to 60 per cent.\n\nScheer said a Conservative government also would allow people to take out 30-year mortgages, up from the current 25-year limit.\n\n\"It is important that we have strong regulations around the financial sector to ensure that our housing industry and our mortgage industry is strong and robust, but we believe that for first-time home buyers a 30-year amortization period is appropriate,\" he said.\n\n\"Young first-time home buyers often have their highest earning years ahead of them. And so, as they get promoted and as their incomes go up, they'll be able to carry the mortgages that they've gotten into.\"\n\nSurplus federal real estate for development\n\nThe Conservative Party is also promising to launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and make surplus federal real estate available for development.\n\nThe moves drew praise from some industry associations.\n\nThe Canadian Real Estate Association said the longer mortgage element would \"ultimately [provide] greater flexibility for home buyers looking at financing to purchase a home of their own.\"\n\nThe Canadian Home Builders' Association, which had been pushing for changes to the stress test, said the announcement would help \"well-qualified first-time buyers that have been locked out of home ownership in recent years.\"\n\nThe Liberals revealed their housing plan on the first full day of the campaign, pledging to expand the First Time Home Buyer Incentive program introduced with this year's budget.\n\nThe program is available to first-time homebuyers who earn less than $120,000 a year, but under the expanded program those with incomes up to $150,000 would qualify.\n\nIn February, the Liberals announced plans to turn surplus federal properties into new affordable housing.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is promising that, if he's elected, he'll\u00a0review the so-called \"stress test\" to help first-time homebuyers get approved for\u00a0mortgages\u00a0and allow people to take out longer mortgages for lower monthly payments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293860.1569250732!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20190923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
