We just had two children so we got \u00a3200.'\n\nHilary explained that the payment would double if both parents were academics, she said: 'If you only had one academic then you would have only got \u00a3100.'\n\nThe professor admitted that she feels 'guilty' about taking the money, and said that at the time she knew the science of eugenics was 'garbage' and believed that all children should be treated with 'love and care'.\n\nWho was William Beveridge? Lord William Beveridge was a British Economist and Liberal politician born in March 1879, who is credited with creating the welfare state. He was an active member of the Eugenics Society, which promoted the study of methods to 'improve' the human race by controlling reproduction. In 1909, he proposed that men who could not work should be supported by the state 'but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights \u2013 including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood.' Lord William Beveridge was a British Economist and Liberal politician born in March 1879, who is credited with creating the welfare state Having worked in the civil service, he went on to become director at the London School of Economics in 1919. While there, he attempted to create a Department of Social Biology and though it was never fully established, a fierce anti-eugenicist named Lancelot Hogben was named its chair. He departed from LSE in 1937, with some speculating that discord between those in favour and those against the study of eugenics was a contributing factor. Returning to politics, he worked on a Social Insurance report, which proposed that all people of should pay a weekly contribution to National Insurance. The money could then be distributed to the vulnerable in society, such as older or unemployed citizens. In the '40s, he credited the Eugenics Society with promoting the children's allowance, which was incorporated into his 1942 Beveridge Report. On the day the House of Commons met to discuss the report, Beveridge addressed a meeting of the Eugenics Society, reassuring them that it was eugenic in intent. The allowance was graded, with middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents. He said the idea of child allowances had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, to limit the number of children born to poor households.\n\nShe said: 'I'm a bit guilty, it was so unjust.'\n\nWhen asked whether she was ever flattered to be considered the brightest in society, she said: 'No we just laughed about it.\n\n'I married a biologist, he knows the whole thing is just scientific garbage. I regard it as just monstrous.'\n\nShe added: 'You know if you believe all children should be treated with love and care and have a good life, then how could you accept that incentive?'\n\nHilary said she considered eugenics 'monstrous' and 'garbage', and added she now felt 'guilty' about the incentive\n\nHilary went on to explain the attitude of people at the time, insisting the 'ruling class' were keen to 'look after national stock'.\n\nShe said: 'What do you do when you have a litter of dogs and one is the runt of the litter? You strangle it or you put it in a bucket of water.\n\n'That's how I think the ruling class thought about people - is that you want to look after it, you want to look after the national stock.'\n\nThe series also spoke with Jonathan Portes, 53, a Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the School of Politics and Economics of King's College, London.\n\nWhat is eugenics?\n\nEugenics is the belief that society can be improved by encouraging selective breeding. Before the atrocities of Nazi Germany, eugenics - the system of measuring human traits, seeking out the desirable ones and cutting out the undesirable ones - was once practiced the world over. In the decades following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's 'On the Origin of Species', the interest in eugenics spread through Britain, the United States and Europe. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution created a new interest in genetics and heredity, which fuelled the eugenics movement, with many proponents using his work as scientific justification for eugenics. In the late 19th century, advocates claimed that wealthier and more sucessful members of society were being 'outbred' by the lower classes and the 'unfit', and that the human race was at risk of deterioration. Improvements in medicine as well as charity and centralised governments were blamed for 'interfering' with the process of natural selection, as theorised by Darwin, and promoting the survival of the supposed unfit. Advocates of eugenics during the early twentieth century claimed 'undesirable' genetic traits such as dwarfism, deafness and even minor defects like a cleft palate needed to be wiped out of the gene pool. Scientists would measure the human skulls of felons in an effort to eradicate criminality - whilst other eugenic proponents suggested simply cutting out entire groups of people because of the colour of their skin. In 1907, the eugenics Education Society was founded in Britain to campaign for sterilisation and marriage restrictions for the weak to prevent the degeneration of Britain's population. Meanwhile from 1907 in the United States, men, women and children who were deemed 'insane, idiotic, imbecile, feebleminded or epileptic' were forcibly sterilised, often without being informed of what was being done to them. Hitler believed the nation had become weak, corrupted by dysgenics, the infusion of degenerate elements into its bloodstream. In 1931, Labour MP Archibald Church proposed a bill for the compulsory sterilisation of certain categories of 'mental patient' in Parliament. By 1938, 33 American states permitted the forced sterilisation of women with learning disabilities and 29 American states had passed compulsory sterilisation laws covering people who were thought to have genetic conditions. Adolf Hitler was said to have first studied the 'racial hygiene' movement during his imprisonment in Landsberg Prison in 1924. But when it came to enacting Nazi eugenics policy, he was inspired by the United States' programs of forced sterilisation, especially California's compulsary sterilisation of citizens suffering from genetic disorders. After the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, both marriage partners had to be tested for hereditary diseases to preserve the supposed racial purity of the Aryan race. The Nazis also established a euthanasia programme for those deemed disabled, run from Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Victims were initially gassed in buses used to transport them from their homes, but gas chambers were later developed. A Genetic Health Court was also set up to decide if men and women should be sterilised, on the grounds of diseases including 'feeble-mindedness', schizophrenia, manic depression, epilepsy, Huntington's chorea, genetic blindness, and 'severe alcoholism'. It's estimated that 350,000 to 400,000 people were sterilised in Nazi Germany. After the horrors of World War II, the idea of 'racial hygiene' fell out of favour, although prominent figures continued to support the theories of eugenics, including Marie Stopes. As medical technology advanced, a new form of eugenics grew in popularity. Modern eugenics, known as human genetic engineering, sees the alteration of genes to prevent disease, cure disease or improve your body in some significant way. The benefits of the principle are staggering, as devastating illnesses could potentially be cured. However, there is a potential cost in modern genetic engineering, because people could potentially eliminate what they consider 'undesirable' traits in their children before they're even born. Many consider this idea controversial, because what these 'undesirable' traits may be is left open to interpretation. Prenatal screening could be considered by some as a form of eugenics, as it may lead to abortions of children with certain traits. Earlier this year, a Chinese scientist called He Jiankui global controversy by altering the embryos of twins to make them immune to HIV. He used the powerful gene-editing procedure CRISPR to modify the DNA of unborn twin girls, nicknamed 'Lulu' and 'Nana'. In March of this year, a group of international scientists called for a worldwide ban on editing genes to make 'designer babies'. Researchers asked for a ban on editing the DNA of living humans because they say there's a need to slow down the 'most adventurous plans to re-engineer the human species'. Gene-editing is a process in which scientists can add, remove or change sections of DNA which ultimately affect how an organism is formed. In humans, editing them could one day mean manipulating DNA to instruct the body to produce a certain hair or eye colour, or changing those which cause incurable conditions like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy. Scientists have argued the technology would \u2018open the door' for affluent parents to choose the best qualities and create a new form of genetically modified human.\n\nIn 2012, the academic was enlisted as part of the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) program, which examined 'troubled families' following the 2011 London Riots.\n\nJonathan claimed that some of the eugenicist policy throughout history regarding children may echo through today, citing the limit in universal credit, implemented in 2017.\n\nHe said: 'We have just chosen to introduce a three child limit in universal credit, more than two children that is your lot.\n\nJonathan Portes, 53, a professor at King's College, also appeared on the programme to discuss how eugenicist policy continued to influence policy today, citing the limit in universal credit as one example\n\n'You are [told that you are] being irresponsible. We are effectively saying to low income families, and that includes low income families that work, that we are going to penalise you for the act of having a third child.'\n\nHe added: 'I think that is quite explicitly a message to some parts of society that we think you are having too many children.'\n\nViewers said the programme had left them shocked, with one calling the idea of eugenics 'dangerous'.\n\nMany viewers were left 'shocked' by the programme, with some calling the idea of eugenics 'dangerous'\n\nOne tweeted: 'Do watch both episodes of this programme, on the tenacious hold of eugenic ideas and, floating nearby, practices.\n\n'However @AngelaDSaini and @AdamPearson do more than just shock: they make you think harder about a dangerous idea characterised by sloppy thought.'\n\nAnother commented: 'Now watching the programme on #eugenics and have gone from thinking how wonderful the world is, to how awful we can be.'\n\nAnother viewer added: 'Another thought-provoking and shocking in places installment of this excellent 2 part programme. It's definitely informed about issues we never really thought about. Brilliant.'", "description": "Academic, Hilary Rose, 84, from London,  claimed that \u00a350, worth roughly \u00a31100 today, would 'just appear in your payslip' after having children, or \u00a3100 if both parents were academics.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/08/19577170-0-image-a-2_1570780495818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
