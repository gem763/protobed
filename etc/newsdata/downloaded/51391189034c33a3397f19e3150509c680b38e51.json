But it was survival. Not a win. Because over the course of three hours, and the post-debate spin as well, Biden\u2019s mental standing was not just the subtext, but the focus of the conversation.\n\nSome candidates attacked him without claiming they were doing so. Others were much more open about their motives.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said soon after the debate concluded.\n\nIn the end, it may not matter. Biden fended off attacks from his fellow candidates and left the night relatively unscathed. But the issue is now plainly out in the open as evidenced by his campaign\u2019s scramble to deal with it.\n\n\u201cAttacking Joe Biden is not the way to advance yourself in the polls,\u201d said Kate Beddingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director. \u201cCandidates are seeing that and learning that lesson... our hope is that this will continue to be a more substantive conversation moving forward.\u201d\n\nSymone Sanders, another Biden campaign senior adviser, audibly chuckled at the idea that voters might be concerned about broadsides attacking the former vice president\u2019s age, fortitude, and credibility among Democrats.\n\nVoters, Sanders told reporters after the debate\u2019s conclusion, \u201cknow Joe Biden has shown up time after time, so asserting anything that flies in the face of what the voters know to be true themselves, because of their experience with Vice President [Biden], just won\u2019t stick.\u201d\n\nBiden and his team had ample time to prepare for questions about his age, acuity, and stamina. His two previous debate performances had been criticized for their shakiness, and in the run-up to the third, his staff insisted that he had put in the work to avoid a similar performance.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is questioning whether he\u2019s up to the task, just watch him,\u201d a senior Biden campaign official told reporters ahead of the debate. \u201cHe has a big target on his back, and the other candidates have made clear in previous debates that they are going to be launching attacks on him,\u201d the official added.\n\nEarly on, Biden did seem up to the task. He sparred with the leading progressives in the race over their Medicare for All plans, holding his own against Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as they accused him of incrementalism in his approach.\n\nIn the process, however, the attacks on his acuity began. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of forgetting that he had said people would have to opt in to get Medicare-like insurance under his plan.\n\n\u201cYou just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago they would have to buy in,\u201d Castro insisted. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nBiden hadn\u2019t actually done what he was accused of. Indeed, moments earlier, he\u2019d said the opposite: \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\u201d\n\nBut the seed had been planted by Castro, who would later claim that he was in no way trying to question the former VP\u2019s mental state.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Castro told reporters after the debate, asked whether he was implying anything about Biden\u2019s age or mental acuity. \u201cI was going after the difference that we have in healthcare policy, and what he just said on the stage.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Biden offered up fodder for more questions. At one point, he seemed to conflate Afghanistan with Iraq, as he discussed how the former was actually three regions forced into one. At another point, he spoke about the educational benefits that playing records at night gave to underprivileged children, before pivoting to discuss Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Biden said that non-violent criminals should not be in jail only for his campaign to clarify that he was speaking of non-violent drug offenders.\n\nWhile several of these moments passed without commentary during the debate, privately, Democratic operatives were buzzing with concern.\n\nFor Biden\u2019s defenders, Castro\u2019s attack\u2014and the questions it prompted\u2014reeked of opportunism, and tacky opportunism at that.\n\n\u201cIt was unfortunate that Secretary Castro decided to go the way he did,\u201d Biden campaign adviser Anita Dunn told reporters in the spin room following the debate\u2019s conclusion, noting a \u201cdifferent attitude\u201d towards both the former vice president and his tenure in the Obama administration than in debates past.\n\nAnd even some of Biden\u2019s opponents came to his defense. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) called Castro\u2019s charge \u201cso personal and so unnecessary.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s allies pointed to his lengthy history in politics as a way of stressing the voters would judge his record and not his debate moments.\n\nAnd Biden did not shy away from talking about that lengthy record on Thursday. In fact, he took pains to remind listeners of his time as a public defender while Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, about his role in the passage of the Brady bill in 1993, as well as his sponsorship of the Violence Against Women Act 25 years ago \u2014 all in response to a seemingly unrelated question about Obama-era deportations.\n\nWhat may benefit Biden the most is that the punches directed his way seemed to fall flat and others in the field declined to pile on.\n\n\u201cIt certainly was uncomfortable,\u201d said entrepreneur Andrew Yang when asked what he made of Castro\u2019s attack on Biden. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a meme of my facial expression being like, that just happened?\u201d Yang said, echoing South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s onstage reaction that the exchange \u201creminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cI probably reacted in the same way that most Americans did,\u201d Yang said.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who blindsided Biden during the first debate in Miami, appeared less inclined to take a swing at the frontrunner.\n\nAfter moderator David Muir questioned Harris about whether her plan to ban the import of assault weapons through executive order was realistic, citing Biden\u2019s comments about the topic, Biden interjected, \u201cSome things you can. Many things you can't.\u201d\n\nInstead of taking a swing, Harris opted for an awkward laugh-jab. \u201c Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.\u201d\n\nBiden, ignoring the overt reference to the Obama-Biden campaign slogan, responded, \u201cLet's be constitutional. We've got a Constitution.\u201d", "description": "The former vice president started out strong but veered off course after Castro questioned his memory.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "Hanna Trudo", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1718,w_3054,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568352146/GettyImages-1167635927_fkm6ie", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
