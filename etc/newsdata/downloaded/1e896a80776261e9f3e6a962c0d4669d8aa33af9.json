Bush\u2019s funeral and posted online about dining at the White House with President Donald Trump, Parnas lived a checkered life, often working with fraudsters and others tied to organized crime. As Parnas and one of his alleged co-conspirators heads to arraignment next Wednesday on charges of manipulating the American political system at the behest of foreigners, the ease with which he was able to buy his way into Trump\u2019s inner circle provides an alarming indicator of the integrity of that system.\n\nLev Parnas with President Donald Trump in 2014.\n\nA lawyer for Parnas, John Dowd, did not respond to a request for comment. On Saturday, Dowd told a POLITICO reporter he was \u201cnot going to respond\u201d to any future questions about Parnas, who faces a slew of campaign finance charges. This account was pieced together through interviews, Florida public records, long-forgotten news stories and press releases.\n\nBorn in Ukraine in 1972 and raised in Brooklyn, Parnas has told the New Yorker that he worked for a realtor selling units in Trump buildings as a teenager. He\u2019s spent his adult life in Florida, where over a 20-year period he provided 21 different business addresses for at least 16 different ventures. One of them, the PC Edge Foundation, registered to the same Trump Palace address as the episode involving the gun, proclaimed its mission was \u201cto raise funding and awareness to various charity organizations. Our main focus is to eliminate illiteracy.\u201d It was shut down after 17 months.\n\nIt was also just one of many obscure forays in Florida business that now are getting a second look as Parnas heads to court on federal criminal charges while also serving as a central figure in the House-led Trump impeachment investigation. In 1999, Parnas appeared in the state\u2019s corporate records listed with a Boca Raton address as a director of Program Trading Corp. Among the other four directors was a Staten Island man, Mitchell Reisman, who remained in business with Parnas through at least 2003. Parnas also named Reisman as a director of one of his own businesses, Aaron Investment Corp. But in 2004, Reisman pleaded guilty in New Jersey to theft by deception and securities fraud for activities that were unrelated to Program Trading Corp. but nonetheless dated to the period of his business partnership with Parnas. Later, Resiman was sentenced to 51 months in prison for another fraud scheme that dated back to 2003 and was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nSome of Parnas\u2019s escapades were relatively harmless. In 2002, he was among a group of Miami Heat ticket-holders sued by the basketball team for failing to pay on multi-season, six-figure contracts for premium seats. At the time, Parnas told the Miami Herald he had stopped paying because the team wasn\u2019t living up to its end of an agreement that included a verbal promise to have a player hand him a signed team basketball at center court during halftime of a game in 2000. When that did not happen, Parnas told the paper, \u201cIt made me look like a fool in front of my clients.\u201d\n\nOther Parnas ventures had him dealing with associates involved in serious criminal enterprises. By 2006, Parnas was listed in Florida filings as the chairman of Edgetech International. A Nevada-registered corporation that marketed itself as a seller of computer gadgets, Edgetech brought Parnas into business dealings with unsavory characters.\n\nThe firm described itself in one press release as selling \u201cthe PocketSurfer, a new handheld wireless Web access device\u201d to an international audience from Russia. The company was also promoting a product called \u201cThe Edge, the world's first ultra-mobile handheld computer with a built-in modem operating at DSL type- speed,\u201d which it planned to plug in an appearance at the SunDance film festival in Park City, Utah.\n\nMore big announcements kept coming. In September 2006, Edgetech rolled out a partnership with the producer for the pop music band NSYNC, Lou Pearlman, in which a musician signed to Pearlman\u2019s record label inserted lyrics about \u201cThe Edge\u201d into a song, which he then performed at the Glass Lounge, \u201cone of the hottest night clubs on South Beach.\u201d In a press release, Parnas said, \u201cPearlman's accomplishments are legendary within the industry, having reached a level of success not often duplicated.\u201d\n\nAt the time, investigators were closing in on Pearlman for running one of the largest ponzi schemes in history. In February 2007, Florida authorities seized control of some of Pearlman\u2019s businesses amid fraud accusations. Four months later, a federal grand jury indicted Pearlman and after his conviction he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Pearlman died in federal custody in 2016.\n\nIn 2008, federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York indicted Arthur Dozortsev, his brother Nikolai Dozortsev, and Ricardo Fanchini for their roles in an organized crime enterprise that trafficked in cocaine, heroin and MDMA.\n\nWhen Nikolai Dozortsev \u2014 who has been described by law enforcement as a \u201chigh-ranking member of Russian organized crime\u201d \u2014 pleaded guilty to some of the counts, he agreed to forfeit a variety of assets. Among them were 100,000 shares of EdgeTech stock registered under the name \u201cArthur Dozortsen\u201d with an n, and seized from the home of his brother, Arthur, according to court records.\n\nReached by phone, Arthur Dozortsev said that Parnas had induced him to invest $20,000 by promising him that the value of EdgeTech stock was guaranteed to rise, but that it ended up being worthless. \u201cHe screwed me, bro,\u201d Arthur Dozortsev said.\n\nFlorida officials in June 2009 revoked Edgetech\u2019s license to operate in the state after a Fort Lauderdale lawyer that Parnas had long used as his registered agent resigned the position. The attorney, Jay Valinsky, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMore ventures followed. In 2010, Parnas solicited a $350,000 bridge loan from an investor for the financing of a movie, \u201cAnatomy of an Assassin,\u201d that never got made, and then failed to pay the money back, according to court records. By 2016, a judge had awarded a $500,000 judgment against Parnas, which the investor is still trying to collect.\n\nAnother Parnas venture \u2014 one of several he launched in conjunction with David Correia, an alleged co-conspirator in the campaign finance crimes \u2014 was Fraud Guarantee.\n\nAccording to John Cardillo, a conservative radio host and former New York City police officer who did consulting work for Parnas on the venture, Fraud Guarantee was \u201coriginally going to do something with data\u201d but then \u201cmorphed into an insurance type play.\u201d\n\nIt was this entity, Fraud Guarantee, that Giuliani now says retained him for legal advice, for which he told Reuters he received $500,000, bringing him into association with Parnas.\n\nCardillo, who said his involvement with the firm was short-lived, said he knew Parnas socially, and viewed him as a sober family man. \"He wasn\u2019t throwing cash around with women all around him,\" Cardillo recalled. (That appears to have changed, judging by bank records obtained by Buzzfeed that show Parnas spending lavishly at luxury hotspots and a Kiev strip club.)\n\nAnother investor in Fraud Guarantee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described Parnas as \u201ca great father,\u201d and \u201cnot a bad person.\u201d\n\nStill, the investor is wondering what happened to their money. \u201cI\u2019m afraid myself,\u201d the person said. \u201cI invested money. I never got anything back. And now I\u2019m sitting cold. It\u2019s a bit scary. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nDespite this past, when Trump mounted his run for president, Parnas had no problem entering the future president\u2019s inner circle. He attended fundraisers for Trump in Florida and the campaign\u2019s election night victory party in New York. A photo posted on Facebook days after the January 2017 inauguration by Republican mega-donor John Catsimatidis shows Parnas at a gala in a tuxedo, standing just feet from Trump, Catsimatidis and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Bush\u2019s funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. last December. Jeb Bush told Buzzfeed this week that he thought Giuliani bringing Parnas to his father\u2019s funeral was \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Giuliani did not respond to a question about the invitation.\n\nIn a since-deleted Facebook post from last May, Parnas published a photo of himself with Trump, tagging the location as the White House, and captioned it \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation,\u201d according to an investigation published this summer by Buzzfeed and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment about the post.\n\nIn March, a Jewish group, National Council of Young Israel, honored Parnas and Fruman with a \u201cLovers of Zion\u201d award at a New York gala attended by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and Giuliani.\n\nAt the event, public relations executive Josh Nass spotted the two men behind the scenes in a VIP section, and curious about the unfamiliar faces in the small world of New York\u2019s pro-Israel Orthodox event circuit, greeted them in Russian. \"These are two typical Brighton Beach thugs,\u201d Nass recalled. \u201cThat's what they look like. That's what they talk like. I was talking to them in that sort of slang. That's why they liked me.\u201d\n\nThe conversation did not get very far before Parnas\u2019s phone began to ring, and Nass glanced down to see that the caller ID was flashing Giuliani\u2019s name. \u201cI was aghast,\u201d he said, unable to fathom how the man knew the president\u2019s personal lawyer. \u201cYou should have seen my face.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ad/0d/7dd92f1f4348bc50e7de1df3f39f/191010-farnas-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
