As soon as news of people getting fined for not wearing a helmet inside a car (that was a mistake, of course), or not wearing a seat belt in an auto, came to forefront, some people actually started wearing helmets inside their cars.\n\nBut the Act did prove to be effective with the number of fines going down by a large percentage across various cities of the country.\n\nAmong people who left no chance for the traffic police to fine them, was a picture of a person traveling with his dog on a two-wheeler.\n\nThe picture of the dog wearing a helmet and sitting calmly on a scooter, behind its owner, has been doing rounds on Twitter for sometime now. Someone even shared it with the caption, \u2018Delhi me traffic police ka Khauf\u2019. Clearly, the owner wanted to take no chances with the police, even if the pillion was not human.\n\nDon't Miss 576 SHARES 242 SHARES 6.7 K SHARES\n\nSomebody shared this pic with a caption\n\n*Delhi mei traffic police ka Khauf* @dtptraffic @DelhiPolice pic.twitter.com/Lz9m1AXTko \u2014 Himanshu Gupta (@gupta_iitdelhi) September 5, 2019\n\nConversely, we can also learn from the dog and its owner.
