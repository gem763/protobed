It\u2019s not a tall order \u2013 don\u2019t be a drooling fool arguing with a mailbox and you have an even shot at winning in 2020. For Democrats, even if that bar were so low it was buried, it wouldn\u2019t be low enough for them to clear. As if they wanted to drive home the idea that impeachment is a tumor made of Trump Derangement Syndrome, they\u2019ve chosen to make Congressman Adam Schiff the face of it all.\n\nSchiff is the type of Congressman who would be marginalized to the point of irrelevancy if Democrats hadn\u2019t metastasized into the media. His lies are constant, many of them are childish in nature. But mostly they\u2019re obvious.\n\nEvery lie that perfectly fit the liberal narrative about President Trump, even if it didn\u2019t originate with him, has passed through Schiff\u2019s lips. No Democrat with a press credential questions his words anymore and he won\u2019t go anywhere near where the few honest journalists who might. Even the awarding of four Pinocchios this week by the Washington Post has impacted his ability to lie.\n\nThe four Pinocchios, by the way, were for saying he and his staff had not spoken with the so-called whistleblower when they had, and he knew it. That is a blatant lie, not a misstatement, misremembering, or oversight: a lie. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was awarded four \u201cfor repeatedly hiding the truth\u201d that he was on the call. That \u201chiding\u201d consisted of not volunteering that fact to reporters asking about the whistleblower complaint which he\u2019d not read at the time he was asked.\n\nPompeo wasn\u2019t asked if he was on the call and he gets the same verdict as Schiff. It\u2019s good to be a Democrat.\n\nTo illustrate just how good it is to be a Democrat, Schiff was even defended by one of the \u201creporters\u201d he lied to on national television.\n\nThe Daily Beast is about as much of a journalistic outfit as MSNBC, which is why the Beast\u2019s politics editor, Sam Stein, is also on the MSNBC payroll as a Morning Joe regular. Schiff lied directly to Stein about his office\u2019s contact with the whistleblower, saying his office has not spoken with the registered Democrat. When the truth came out, likely leaked by Schiff\u2019s office to the New York Times to get the best possible spin on it (and it really was a gentle story considering), Stein downplayed Schiff\u2019s lie.\n\n\u201cSchiff did appear to lie,\u201d Stein tweeted. Then he accused people being bothered by Schiff\u2019s lie of being \u201ca hack.\u201d The next day he wrote a slobbering kiss of a story entitled, \u201cTrump\u2019s plan to save his presidency: take a hatchet to Adam Schiff.\u201d In it, Stein quotes Schiff as saying \u201cI regret I wasn\u2019t much more clear.\u201d He was crystal clear, there is the truth and he knowingly said the opposite of it. Stein the referred to this lie as \u201cnuance.\u201d\n\nAgain, it\u2019s good to be a Democrat.\n\nSchiff didn\u2019t even have to ask. Every liberal outlet snapped to his defense. Going on the word of an admitted liar, NBC declared there was zero evidence Schiff or his staff had any hand in drafting the complaint and reaching out exclusively to one of the most partisan Democrats in the Russian witch hunt was \u201croutine.\u201d Were journalists honest people themselves they\u2019d be embarrassed.\n\nNow we have reports of a possible second whistleblower considering filing their own complaint about the same non-event call. The reason they\u2019re considering this is to obtain the legal protections that come with whistleblower status. This person is allegedly closer to the call, which means they\u2019re one of the people who illegally leaked it to the original whistleblower. That would be an illegal leak of classified material, which makes this an attempt by this second person to protect themselves from the consequences of breaking the law to start this hoax in the first place. It also stinks of Adam Schiff-advised strategy. Can\u2019t wait for the New York Times story on that in a couple of weeks; wonder how they\u2019ll spin this one.\n\nFrom his constant declarations of \u201cproof of collusion\u201d to his denials of any knowledge of the whistleblower before Congress was notified, Adam Schiff has a history of not only of lying, but of being caught doing so. Yet he has been chosen by Nancy Pelosi to be the face of impeachment: a dishonest man chosen to make a dishonest case to the American people. It\u2019s like OJ Simpson being asked to give the keynote address at a marriage counseling seminar.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to just how weak the case is that they\u2019ve chosen someone with a shameless willingness to tell the public that up is down, that wet is dry, to be the mastermind of impeachment. That Adam Schiff is the one coordinating this attempted coup shows just how crazy Democrats are; that they lost that argument with the mailbox. That ultimately, the Democratic Party has Schiff for brains.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "All the Democrats have to do is act sane, for .10/06/2019 1:30:07AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
