They were waiting on millions in stalled military aid from the United States, and Zelensky was seeking a high-priority White House meeting with Trump.\n\nTrump told his Ukrainian counterpart that his country could improve its image if it completed corruption cases that have \u201cinhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA,\u201d according to a readout of the call released by Kiev.\n\nWhat neither government said publicly at the time was that Trump went even further \u2014 specifically pressing Ukraine\u2019s president to reopen a corruption investigation involving former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, according to two people familiar with the call, which is now the subject of an explosive whistleblower complaint.\n\nDays after the two presidents spoke, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, met with an aide to the Ukrainian president in Madrid and spelled out two specific cases he believed Ukraine should pursue. One was a probe of a Ukrainian gas tycoon who had Biden\u2019s son Hunter on his board. Another was an allegation that Democrats colluded with Ukraine to release information on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cYour country owes it to us and to your country to find out what really happened,\u201d Giuliani said he told the Ukrainian president\u2019s aide, Andriy Yermak, during the Madrid meeting. Yermak, according to Giuliani, indicated that the Ukrainians were open to pursuing the investigations. The aide reiterated the Ukrainians\u2019 plea for a meeting with Trump, a summit that would be an important signal to Russia of Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI talked to him about the whole package,\u201d said Giuliani, who has been lobbying Ukrainian officials to take up the investigations since the spring. Yermak did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew revelations about the dual channels of pressure on Ukraine \u2014 one from the president and one from his personal attorney \u2014 are fuelling questions about whether Trump used his office to try to force a foreign country to take actions damaging to his political opponents.\n\nGiuliani said he has kept the president informed of his efforts in Ukraine for months. But he declined to say specifically what he has told the president. \u201cMy narrow interest is for the benefit of my client,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nAsked Friday if he had discussed Biden on his call with Zelensky in July, Trump told reporters, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d adding: \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nNational security experts said Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine was highly inappropriate.\n\n\u201cThis is requesting assistance from a foreign government to tarnish your political rival and opening the door to outside interference in our politics and elections,\u201d said David Kramer, a former State Department official responsible for Russia and Central Europe during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nGiuliani said Trump did not threaten to withhold U.S. funds from Ukraine if the country did not investigate Biden and Democrats.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do that. President Trump didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Giuliani said this week.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has held Zelensky at arm\u2019s length since his election in April.\n\nTrump refused to set a firm date for an Oval Office meeting with the newly minted Ukrainian president at the White House \u2014 a sit-down that Ukraine has urgently sought to demonstrate Washington\u2019s backing as it fights a long-simmering war with \u00adRussian-backed proxies in its east.\n\nU.S. officials and members of the Trump administration wanted the meeting to go ahead, but Trump personally rejected efforts to set it up, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nBy the time Trump and Zelensky spoke during the July 25 telephone call, the meeting at the White House still hadn\u2019t been set. Soon after, it was disclosed that the White House had put a hold on $250 million in military aid for Ukraine after Trump ordered a review of the assistance package.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Zelensky this month in a Kiev meeting that the aid was being held back because Trump was concerned about corruption and thought the Europeans should provide Ukraine more assistance, according to Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who was in attendance, as well as an aide to Johnson.\n\nA former senior administration official who repeatedly discussed the issue with Trump said that the president thought \u201cwhat we were doing in Ukraine was pointless and just aggravating the Russians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s position basically is, we should recognise the fact that the Russians should be our friends, and who cares about the Ukrainians?\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.\n\n\u00a9 AP Former Vice President Joe Biden\n\nMeanwhile, throughout the spring and summer, Giuliani was pressing the Ukrainian government behind the scenes, gathering information about Biden and briefing Trump on his findings, he said in several interviews with The Washington Post.\n\nAt one point this year, the former New York mayor had planned a trip to Ukraine, but it was scuttled amid criticism about the propriety of his visit. Instead, he has made his case in phone calls and meetings with Ukrainian officials in New York and Madrid.\n\nGiuliani said he was operating in his personal capacity as Trump\u2019s lawyer, although he said the State Department help put him in touch with Yermak.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concerns about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times, have only learned later from the Ukrainians, who said they were unsure if Giuliani was officially speaking for the U.S. government, according to two officials with knowledge of the matter.\n\nVideo: President Donald Trump gets heat for urging Ukraine probe (AP)\n\nGiuliani has pushed Ukrainian officials to renew an investigation into the activities of Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas producer while his father handled U.S.-Ukraine policy.\n\nIn particular, Giuliani has alleged Biden advocated for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who at one point had overseen an anti-corruption probe of the gas producer\u2019s owner. However, the case had been dormant before the prosecutor\u2019s firing, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials, and the U.S. ambassador at the time publicly called for the case against the gas tycoon to proceed.\n\nYuri Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News in May that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nBut Giuliani has said there is more to uncover, adding that his goal is to make sure Biden didn\u2019t become president without having to answer for the issues in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to him: You\u2019re not getting from here to the presidency without answering these questions,\u201d Giuliani said in May of his efforts. \u201cThe president\u2019s counsel is entitled to develop evidence.\u201d\n\nBiden has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cNot one single credible outlet has given any credibility to these assertions,\u201d the former vice president said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday. \u201cNot one single one.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has also urged Ukraine to investigate whether Democrats colluded with Ukrainian authorities during the 2016 election to put out information damaging to Manafort, who is now serving a 7\u00bd-year prison sentence for financial crimes related to lobbying he did for a Russia-aligned politician in Ukraine.\n\n\u00a9 Andrew Harrer/Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has been pushing Ukrainian officials to launch probes into the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\nIn all, Giuliani said he has had about five conversations this year with Yermak, the aide to Zelensky. He said Yermak was concerned that Trump had not met with the Ukrainians and was \u201cembarrassed\u201d at the lack of a meeting \u2014 and wanted to make sure \u201cnothing is wrong.\u201d\n\nAt the Madrid meeting this summer, Giuliani said he did not address the topic of U.S. aid. \u201cI was not involved in the aid at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea the $250 million was on the table.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he left the meeting with the impression that the Ukrainians would pursue the cases he has pushed them to take up. \u201cHe told me he would make sure things were investigated appropriately but they would need some time to appoint a new prosecutor,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nYermak told the New York Times last month that the new government in Ukraine was committed to fairly investigating possible crimes but all decisions had to wait until the country had a new top prosecutor.\n\nPeople close to Zelensky have told American officials that if there is a case to pursue, they will follow it and the law \u2014 an attempt by Zelensky and his aides to avoid getting drawn into a partisan political fight in the United States.\n\n\u201cFor us, the important thing is to not get involved,\u201d said one Ukrainian official earlier this summer, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing good that can come from this,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to be used.\u201d\n\nDuring the Kiev meeting with Zelensky this month, Murphy said there was \u201ca large level of discomfort from the outreach of the president\u2019s political team. The embassy didn\u2019t know what to do with it either.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard they were confused and vexed about what they should do by these requests,\u201d Murphy said Friday. \u201cThis is a brand-new president, and he starts getting requests from the president\u2019s political team to do investigation. My concern was definitely validated by the conversations I had in Kiev.\u201d\n\nWhen they spoke, Zelensky also stressed the importance of a meeting with Trump, adding that he did not want to be drawn into the 2020 presidential election, Murphy said.\n\nZelensky did not respond to requests for comment Friday.\n\nThe two presidents had been scheduled to meet in Warsaw earlier this month until Trump called off the trip, citing Hurricane Dorian\u2019s projected landfall in the United States.\n\nVice President Pence went in his place. Asked by reporters on the trip if he brought up Biden with his meeting with Zelensky, Pence said he did not. But he connected the delayed military aid to Ukraine\u2019s actions on corruption.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cThe president wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine. And that\u2019s an expectation the American people have and the president has expressed very clearly.\u201d\n\nDays later, on Sept. 12, the U.S. aid package was delivered to Ukraine and announced the following day by Zelensky at a political conference.\n\nZelensky thanked Trump for releasing the $250 million in aid, noting that another $140 million was included as well, adding, \u201cNow I can say that we have excellent relations with the U.S.A.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think we are really moving in the right direction and we have the right relationship with our strategic partner \u2014 the United States of America,\u201d he added.\n\nPandas to glacial battlefields: Best photos of the week [The Atlantic]\n\nMurphy said he and other senators were planning legislation to push through the aid that would have won Republican support, potentially forcing the White House\u2019s hand.\n\nZelensky and Trump are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. Still, the White House hasn\u2019t set a date for an Oval Office meeting with Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky are part of the whistleblower complaint by an intelligence official that is at the center of a showdown between the executive branch and Congress. Administration officials have refused to divulge any information about the substance of an Aug. 12 report to the inspector general of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nEarlier this month, House Democrats launched an investigation into whether Trump sought to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden in exchange for receiving U.S. foreign aid.\n\nGiuliani said he does not believe House Democrats are acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d and said the administration\u2019s resistance to sharing more information is justified.\n\n\u201cCongress doesn\u2019t have a decent purpose in getting it. They\u2019re a bunch of headhunters and have lost any credibility,\u201d Giuliani said, adding: \u201cThey\u2019re desperately trying to revive their false story about Russian collusion. It\u2019s not a legal issue, it\u2019s a political issue.\u201d\n\nMSN UK is committed to Empowering the Planet and taking urgent action to protect our environment.
