He was so funny and silly and clever and kind and handsome and his smile made my heart soar. We were together for nearly six years and he made me the happiest man on the planet...\n\n'In the end he lost his battle with addiction and depression. I guess some people don\u2019t have the armour for this world. I think of him probably a hundred times a day, every day. In truth, I think of little else...\n\n'I would give anything to see him again and maybe one day I will, but for now I will be grateful for the time we had together and the love we shared. It was like no other.'\n\nHeartache: The actor and comedian, 45, who divorced Kevin in October 2008, shared a poignant message on Instagram on Friday\n\nShortly before he was found, Kevin, a TV producer, posted the message: 'Kevin McGee thinks that death is much better than life.'\n\nHe is thought to have become deeply depressed after splitting with the comedian, and friends reported that his drug-taking had spiralled out of control.\n\nThe couple had been together for six years when they announced their split in June 2008. Police broke into McGee's flat in the Bruntsfield district of Edinburgh at 8am yesterday and he was found hanged.\n\nThe ominous message had been posted less than four hours earlier, at 4.26am - after which a fearful friend alerted the police.\n\nA friend of the former couple said at the time: 'Matt was floored when he heard the news. He always loved Kevin despite their differences and their difficult marriage.'\n\nTragic: In 2009, Kevin, 32, who had well-documented issues with substance abuse and suffered with depression, was found dead in his flat after hanging himself, after he wrote a suicide note on the social networking site Facebook (pictured in 2007)\n\nJust a week earlier, McGee had appeared positive, writing on the same site: 'Kevin thinks there's nothing he can't face... except for bunnies.'\n\nWhen the couple first met in a nightclub - before Lucas was famous - McGee worked for Carbon Media, a branch of a television company Princess Productions.\n\nThey married in December 2006 in a flamboyant pantomime-themed ceremony at Home House, a private members' club in central London.\n\nGuests including Sir Elton John, Paul O'Grady, Barbara Windsor and Courtney Love joined the couple for a lavish party afterwards dressed up as their favourite nursery rhyme characters.\n\nPain: Sharing a sweet snap of a smiling Kevin, Matt penned the caption: 'This is Kevin John McGee, who died ten years ago today' (pictured in 2007)\n\nJust 18 months after the ceremony however, the relationship broke down when Kevin admitted his unreasonable behaviour had caused an irretrievable breakdown.\n\nKevin often spent large amounts on cocaine and Matt paid for him to attend rehab. One friend said: 'Kevin found it really difficult to deal with Matt's fame. Being thrust into the world of A-list parties and free booze was hard.'\n\n'Matt is a pretty down-to-earth guy and never touches drugs. Cracks started to show in the marriage because as much as Matt loved Kevin, he couldn't deal with his behaviour.'\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details", "description": "In 2009, Kevin, 32, who had well-documented issues with substance abuse and suffered with depression, was found dead in his flat after hanging himself", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/09/19327574-0-image-a-23_1570263570746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
