When he later opened his Tesla app, though, he discovered \u2014 to his \u201chorror,\u201d he wrote \u2014 that the car\u2019s interior temperature had jumped to 85 degrees because Dog Mode had turned off. He returned to the car to find his dog was okay, and then tweeted about the incident to both Musk and Tesla, and the CEO (who often solicits suggestions on Twitter) quickly responded: \u201cFixing...\u201d\n\nDog Mode was rolled out in February as an extension of Tesla\u2019s \u201cCabin Overheat Protection\u201d mode, which automatically cooled the cabin if it reached high temperatures in order to keep \u201cbabies or pets\u201d safe, according to Musk. Dog Mode is a more proactive setting that the owner can choose. It automatically keeps the interior temperature cool and puts a message on the car\u2019s touchscreen to tell passersby that the dogs are okay, and that their \u201cowner will be back soon.\u201d\n\nFixing \u2026 \u2014 E (@elonmusk) July 31, 2019\n\nDog Mode is activated through the fan settings on Tesla\u2019s touchscreens. Sood tells The Verge that the problem arose because, after activating Dog Mode, he then manually adjusted the fan setting to try to keep the car even cooler, since Seattle (where the incident took place) is in the middle of a heat wave. He said he kept monitoring his car through Tesla\u2019s smartphone app, and says Dog Mode remained on at first.\n\n\u201cProbably an easy fix but if I wasn\u2019t watching him it would have been horrible.\u201d\n\nBut after about 10 minutes, he noticed the temperature had jumped, because \u201cbasically the AC stops working in Dog Mode if you adjust the fan,\u201d he writes. \u201cProbably an easy fix but if I wasn\u2019t watching him it would have been horrible.\u201d\n\nTesla is often lauded for adding new abilities to its cars with over-the-air software updates, from new driver assistance modes to video games and convenience features like Dog Mode. (And for what it\u2019s worth, Sood says \u201cthe fact that the CEO responded as quickly as he did is pretty awesome.\u201d) Not all of these rollouts go smoothly, like when Tesla had to pull the classic Atari game Pole Position from its cars because it hadn\u2019t properly secured the rights. But the company is typically more careful with features that can put lives in danger, like how it recently delayed the release of an automatic parking mode called \u201cEnhanced Summon.\u201d\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s not clear when the company will roll out the fix Musk referred to.", "description": "Elon Musk says the company is \"fixing\" a problem where the feature \u2014 which automatically keeps dogs cool while their owners are away from the cars \u2014 could inadvertently be deactivated.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lMo3F42ejwGwu0Z0sxmGfq9uP8=/0x47:2866x1548/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18395152/Screen_Shot_2019_08_01_at_12.13.24_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-08-01"}
