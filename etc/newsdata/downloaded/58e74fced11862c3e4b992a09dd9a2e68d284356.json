Pictured: Mercury\n\nExperts advise us to watch out for flight delays and missing luggage, unsigned contracts and broken gadgets and to beware a heightened risk of accidentally hitting \u2018reply all\u2019 on sensitive emails.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, the next Mercury retrograde is just around the corner. From October 31 (Brexit day, the day the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, by the way) to November 20, mischievous Mercury \u2013 a planet with the power to disrupt all our communications \u2013 is set to wreak havoc.\n\nBut before you despair, top British astrologer Yasmin Boland says there are easy ways to navigate the coming weeks and not only avoid disasters but actually harness the curious power of Mercury to change your life for the better...\n\nSo what actually is it?\n\nSo when Mercury, a planet that governs communication, transport and technology, appears to travel backwards through the heavens, this is a very serious business.\n\nIn fact, it is an optical illusion. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and its orbit is shorter than Earth\u2019s \u2013 a mere 88 days compared to our 365 days, which means that Mercury experiences four years in the time it takes us to complete one orbit of the Sun.\n\nAnd this produces an unusual visual effect through the telescope as Mercury appears to speed past Earth, slow down and then move in a backwards loop over a period of roughly three weeks \u2013 the phenomenon of Mercury retrograde (or Mercury in Retrograde, as it is often known).\n\nAn illusion or not, it\u2019s hugely significant to astrology fans, who say that as Mercury appears to recede, the energy of the planet actually intensifies \u2013 with dire-sounding effects.\n\nCommunication systems start to slow down. Gadgets malfunction, computers crash, emails fail to arrive or go unanswered.\n\nNot so long ago astrology was the domain of the decidedly eccentric but now it\u2019s got lots of people talking. Pictured: Cosmic clouds of mist\n\nMercury also rules buying and selling, and contracts and agreements, so if you buy an expensive item now you\u2019re more likely to find it\u2019s worth half as much later, or you\u2019ll end up regretting not reading the small print because trouble is likely to ensue.\n\nWhile Mercury is retrograde, you can easily end up feeling as if the world has gone mad: best\u2011laid plans go nowhere and conversations drift off mid\u2011sentence.\n\nThere\u2019s more bad news \u2013 this next phase looks set to be more intense than usual as the forthcoming period of retrograde falls in Scorpio \u2013 a particularly intense sign. So brace yourselves!\n\nNormally, retrograde might merely trigger lost documents or missed trains, but when it occurs in a water sign, we should expect an extra bumpy emotional ride.\n\nAstrologers say that, more than any other sign, Scorpio is a star sign that likes to dig under the surface of things to see what\u2019s being glossed over or whitewashed.\n\nFrom October 31, expect dishonesty of any kind to come back to bite you. If there are secrets in your life, Mercury retrograde will be busy shining a light on them.\n\nAnd with our communications awry, it makes sense to avoid contentious subjects. Be warned, this is not a great time to be having a serious debate.\n\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon storming the Internet\n\nIf you think it all sounds a bit bonkers, you\u2019re not alone \u2013 how much can the planets really determine our luck and fortune?\n\nNot so long ago astrology was the domain of the decidedly eccentric but now it\u2019s got lots of people talking. All types are cursing, joking and chatting about Mercury and its mischievous movements. Type \u2018Mercury retrograde\u2019 into photo-sharing app Instagram and you\u2019ll find more than 20,000 posts on the topic.\n\n\u2018Is Mercury retrograde again or am I just emotional?\u2019 asks one exasperated Twitter user.\n\n\u2018Thank God I got my new job before Mercury is in Retrograde!\u2019 says another.\n\nEven celebrities are jumping on the bandwagon with big names such as pop star Katy Perry and Taylor Swift tweeting about the planet and the havoc it is about to cause.\n\nHow to fight back\n\nNot that those three weeks have to bring torment and misery. In fact, it\u2019s possible to learn the \u2018tricks\u2019 of Mercury retrograde and start working to turn them to your long-term advantage.\n\nIn part, it\u2019s a question of learning to cope. This is not a good time to launch something new, for example. Focus instead on improving what you already have or completing unfinished projects.\n\nBe warned: you might find it hard to nail down a plan and struggle to get decisions from others \u2013 and any decisions that are made are likely to be subject to change. Anything started or purchased when Mercury is retrograde may need to be revisited and revised. But it\u2019s also a question of developing solid habits that will help at any point in the calendar.\n\nIf you take an extra second to hang up your keys by the door when you arrive home, read important documents several times and try to be a bit more forgiving when a friend says something daft, you could sail through unscathed. Perhaps if one gadget breaks down, its replacement will be better; a contested agreement can be re-negotiated in your favour or a criticised project improved.\n\nExpressing yourself clearly might be more of a challenge than usual so focus more and listen harder. Try to be honest with yourself and others at this time.\n\nAim to avoid negative thinking, too, especially the impulse to lash out at someone before they can attack you. Talk face-to-face or on the phone instead of relying on texts or emails. If you don\u2019t get a reply to an email, don\u2019t assume you\u2019re being ignored.\n\nSome people put their life on hold when Mercury is retrograde \u2013 and perhaps they\u2019re right. This is an ideal time to take a break and recharge your batteries. And if things do go wrong, try not to assume the worst.\n\nGive others the benefit of the doubt \u2013 like you, they are more likely to be careless, mistake\u2011prone and forgetful right now too.\n\nMake yourself open to the opportunities that present themselves and try not to rush into judgments.\n\nYou can make the best of this planetary phase \u2013 and emerge the better for it.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to avoid new projects \u2013 and that includes relationships \u2013 so this a great time to deal with unfinished business (whether emotional or practical) instead, to tie up loose ends and create a clear vision for the future.\n\nIf you take advantage of retrograde, you\u2019ll be all fired up and ready for what\u2019s next when Mercury (and, hopefully, life) returns to normal on November 21.\n\nAdapted by Louise Atkinson from The Mercury Retrograde Book by Yasmin Boland and Kim Farnell, published by Hay House on October 15, priced \u00a312.99.
