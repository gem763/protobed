The airport, and police in London, declined to discuss their methods when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe group, Heathrow Pause, said it planned to fly their drones within a 5km \"exclusion zone\" around the airport, potentially prompting the airport to shut down as a safety measure.\n\nThe group said it wanted to fly the drones only at head height, and relatively far from the runway, in the hope of causing severe disruption without endangering any planes.\n\nHowever, their plan failed to materialise, as seen by video footage showing the group trying in vain to fly their drones.\n\nOne of the group's members said in the video: \"There's a jamming signal, so basically we can't get a signal from the remote to the drone.\"\n\nCal Harris, a member of Heathrow Pause, told Business Insider that the signal appeared to be jammed and that the drone's WiFi signal did not work. He said that the group members who experienced the issue and have more information have been arrested.\n\nA terminal in London's Heathrow Airport. pio3/Shutterstock\n\nBased on the group's description, this is different to common software installed in many drones which uses GPS positioning to prevent take-off in known exclusion zones. Drone users have shown this can be bypassed.\n\nHarris also told Business Insider that the group was able to make one drone flight in the restricted area \u2014 indicating that jamming technology may have stopped working or some other drone malfunction had been fixed.\n\nNeither Heathrow Airport nor London's Metropolitan Police would comment to Business Insider on any tactics they may have used.\n\nRead more: Around 1 million square feet of sea ice melted in July as the globe experienced its hottest month in history\n\nThe group said that its members acting as pilots would call the police when they were done and await arrest, and other pilots would then take over. One of the group's members said before the attempt on Friday: \"I'm likely to get arrested and I could be going to prison.\"\n\n\"So why am I doing it? I'm doing it because I'm a father. I've got children and I'm thinking about their future. I'd also like to think that I'm doing it for all the children in the world.\"\n\nThe group announced their protest in advance and met with Metropolitan Police officers to coordinate. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told reporters on Wednesday that he was \"very confident\" that measures were in place to stop the drone flights.\n\nThe incident is a marked departure from drone-related disruption in late 2018 at London's Gatwick Airport, which was paralyzed for more than 36 hours by sporadic drone sightings near the runway.\n\nThousands of people were affected at London's Gatwick Airport on after drone sightings in 2018.

This was the area Heathrow Pause planned to use to fly their drones.\n\nSome of the group's members were arrested before the protests took place. Police said that seven people were arrested on Thursday, in the run up to the protest, and that two more were arrested inside Heathrow's perimeter fence on Friday morning.\n\nAnother person was arrested later on Friday.\n\nThe group is not formally affiliated with Extinction Rebellion \u2014 an international group of climate change activists that has staged protests in cities like London that have disrupted travel\u2014 but some of its members are involved with both groups.\n\nHarris told Business Insider that the group plans to go ahead with more flights at the airport.\n\nHeathrow confirmed to Business Insider on Friday that no flights were disrupted.\n\nHeathrow, Europe's busiest airport, had its busiest-ever day on Wednesday, with 262,000 travelling through the airport. The airport said then in a statement that it is investing in new technology as it expands to \"demonstrate our global leadership on sustainable travel.\"", "description": "A video posted by campaign group Heathrow Pause shows them about to launch drones near the west London airport.
