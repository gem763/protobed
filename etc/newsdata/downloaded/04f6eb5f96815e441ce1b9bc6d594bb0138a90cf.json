The valuation of the held surprisingly steady even as equities/bond yields rose. The and the were the currencies attracting the most demand by market forces, while the European complex, without exception, was the complex most punished, especially the as the UK parliament returned to business as usual, followed by the EUR, which accumulates 5 days in a row losing values in its index, with the net change in the CHF minuscule for the day but nonetheless impressive the turnaround it had. The Oceanic currencies, especially the NZD, also went through reversal days, after the RBNZ-induced gains petered out as the market still prices in further rate cuts down the road. The , in the meantime, has recovered some of its lost 'mojo' at a critical area of demand in its index as part of an improving risk context, which should see it better bid.\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX.

The released Trump-Ukraine call records showed no wrongdoing, according to the US Justice Department. The judicial body determined that the call transcript with Ukraine President Zelenskiy does not violate campaign finance laws. If one reads the transcript linked above, what\u2019s interesting, and what\u2019s keeping the impeachment procedure alive, is the fact that Trump did urge Ukraine to work with Attorney General Barr to investigate Biden and his son, as Politico reports.\n\nMaths don't add up for Trump to be out of office: Nonetheless, the Speaker of the House Pelosi has gone ahead with the impeachment inquiry on the President, even if the behavior of the markets is far from communicating investors care much about it. Getting the necessary votes in the Senate where the GOP has the majority is a tall order, and if you throw into the mix the recent evidence that seems to be exonerating Trump from any known violations, the market mentality at this stage is that the efforts on this impeachment process are highly unlikely to succeed.\n\nTrump shows optimism on China: Trump massaged the rhetoric once again in favor of a recovery in risk assets by stating that \u201ca trade deal with China could happen sooner than you think\u201d, adding that \u201cwe are getting closer and closer\u2026there is a good chance US and China will make a deal\u201d. The comments led to rampant movements back up in equities and US yields. In recent days, Chinese companies have started to make arrangements to buy more US pork, while state and private Chinese enterprises were given a waiver to purchase US soybeans without tariffs. The next high-level trade meetings are scheduled for the 2nd week of October.\n\nFed speakers on duty: The conclusion after hearing a line up of Fed speakers in that the reinforcement of the view that the Central Bank will no longer be as aggressive in cutting rates unless things go downhill quite rapidly. The combination of a more benign US-China trade rhetoric, firm US economic data, and the refusal by the Fed to cut further to encourage further leverage on Trump is playing into the view that the base case, as Fed\u2019s Powell pointed out in the last FOMC, for a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach.\n\nFed's Evans (dove) reiterates bar higher for lower rates: Fed\u2019s Evans (dove, voter) said that even if he is \u201copen minded to additional action.. at the moment we are well positioned\u201d, adding that he doesn\u2019t project further cuts. Fed\u2019s Brainard, a voter and known dove, said that trade policy uncertainty has \u201ca material negative impact on the health of the economy\u201d, while Kashkari (non-voter) reiterated a more dovish stance by saying \u201cI could easily see justifying 50bps lower than it is today\u201d.\n\nA discordant ECB board: In what should be seen as a worrying message of growing division at the helm of the ECB, the executive board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger resigned from the executive board effective Oct 31 due to her contrarian position towards further bond purchases. The news didn\u2019t impact the EUR at first glance, even if the currency has been trading weaker this week as more evidence gathers that the EU is in a very weak spot economically speaking, especially the German manufacturing.\n\nRBNZ keeps powder dry: The RBNZ kept rates unchanged as widely expected, noting \u201cnew information since the August Monetary Policy Statement did not warrant a significant change to the monetary policy outlook\u201d. The Statement was interpreted by the market as neutral, even if expectations for another rate cut in November remain at elevated levels, with further pressure to act should the RBA make a move first by easing further. The NZD initially rose but has since given back all the gains and some more.\n\nBack to business as usual in the UK parliament: The House of Commons in the UK reconvened on Wednesday with PM Johnson still undeterred by the calls to resign, judging the ruling of the unlawful suspension of the Parliament as \u201cwrong\u201d. His focus still appears firmly skewed towards an eventual general election, which would happen if 2/3rds of MPs agree on it, although there appears to be a tactic of buying time for now until the UK PM formally requests a Brexit deadline extension. UK Labour Leader Corbyn declined to say when he would put forward a no-confidence vote in PM Johnson, which will happen once he has more certainty that a no-deal is off the table.\n\nOil sells-off as Saudi Arabia restores oil production capacity: According to Saudi Aramco, the production capacity has been restored to pre-attack levels, which resulted in further US Oil downside pressure. The news is a justified market moves as it reveals faster progress than initially expected. About 1 week ahead of schedule.\n\nRecent Economic Indicators & Events Ahead\n\nSource: Forexfactory\n\nA Dive Into The Charts\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX. An educational article about how to build your own currency meter can be found in the Global Prime's Research section.\n\nThe EUR index came under renewed downside pressure for a fifth day in a row with Wednesday\u2019s candle print carrying an increase in aggregate tick volume activity, which is a bad omen for the outlook of the index. Besides, the close of the index accepted quotes below the previous swing low on Sept 16, which increases further the risk of follow through supply imbalances. Sellers are clearly in control with an availability of about 0.2% (from Wed\u2019s closing price) worth of further declines where I\u2019d expect reduced buy-side activity until the next area of daily support is met.\n\nThe GBP index, after rejected off the 100% proj target on a backside retest, has now found support at the intersection of the baseline (13d ema) + a level of support, most visible through the H8 chart, hence why it\u2019s colored in blue. This area of support is definitely a candidate to see buy-side pressure returning to the market, even if the close at the low of the day with a slight increase in tick volume activity does not bode well. However, in the context of an uptrend, it is nonetheless the most attractive buy-side level quoted for weeks now. Note, the GBP has very unique idiosyncratic dynamics due to the Brexit newsflows. If trading it, you must adapt to it.\n\nThe USD index made headway by successfully completing a bullish rotation, which occurs when the price breaks through its previous swing high. The acceptance of price at the very high of the day is a testament of the vigorous amount of demand flowing back into the Greenback. The bullish close sets the stage for dib-buying activity to potentially be well-rewarded. There is absolutely no indication that suggests the index won\u2019t keep its course northbound from here. The next target eyed is over 0.4% higher from Wed\u2019s close at the 100% proj target, which coincidentally, happens to align to perfection with this year\u2019s high in the index.\n\nThe CAD index found an upside resolution away from ts range, printing a very commanding buy-side candle which sets into motion a more than likely retest of the yearly highs. The level overhead has proven to be a tough nut to crack in the index, but remember that the more a level gets tested, the weaker it tends to get, especially if the last rejection of the level failed to achieve a break of structure in the market, as it was the case back in Sept 11. Any retracement towards the blue area of support outlined in the chart represents a genuine opportunity to engage in buy-side action against weaker currencies.\n\nThe NZD index looks poised to test its trend low after a failure to sustain its post RBNZ gains at the intersection of the daily baseline (13d ema). Those adding short-side exposure on the retest of this powerful dynamic resistance area are now sitting in some handsome profits. The close of the daily candle couldn\u2019t be more bearish, with the printing of a sizeable bearish outside day reminiscence of the type of candle on Sept 12 that led to a 2% fall in the index. The downside available before the recent low is tested is a rather attractive 0.5%.\n\nThe AUD index has been rejected away from a macro support area as outlined in red in the chart. This is an area that acts as a clear onset for a change in price dynamics, with a retest of the baseline my projection in the short term. If this assumption holds true, it would allow for an appreciation of over 0.35% in the in coming days. The daily candle print rejecting the macro support area is evidence that demand is coming back into the Aussie as anticipated. The currency looks positioned to be an outperformer based on both where it finds itself (daily demand) but also likely to benefit from the improved risk sentiment.\n\nThe JPY index has come to a standstill with little price movements as it continues sandwiched between a daily level of resistance and an ascending baseline. A resolution in either direction must first occur before the technical landscape clears up. One can clearly notice through the chart that both areas highlighted (baseline + resistance) have acted as the delimitation that keeps the price in a compression status. An uncertain outlook as the bullish price action above the baseline has now come to a level (daily resistance) where supply pressure could take over.\n\nThe CHF index came to an abrupt hold with an eventual reversal after the buying pressure petered off at a supply zone in the chart, leading to a large upper shadow in the daily. The failure of the index to close above what I characterized as a critical level of resistance places the immediate risks to further losses towards a retest of the baseline now, which would most likely act as the next buy-side point of interest as it is confluent with an area of horizontal support. The fact that the daily candle ended with losses on an increase of tick volume adds weight to the notion that the downside pressure may not be over as buyers clearly failed on the last auction.\n\nImportant Footnotes", "description": "Forex Analysis by Ivan Delgado covering: GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, AUD/USD.
