But that doesn\u2019t mean coffee snobs are hitting their nearest fancy cafe to get their daily caffeine jolt.\n\nIn fact, a National Coffee Association survey from 2017 showed that the majority of coffee was drunk at home that year, and that just 46% was consumed outside the house.\n\nGiven that National Coffee Day is around the corner, it\u2019s only fitting that we\u2019ve been thinking about how to brew the perfect cup of coffee to our tastes.
