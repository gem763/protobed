Kev [trainer Kevin Barry] and I were watching very closely and it was a good win for him.\n\n\u2018He put on a performance where he said he was going to put on pressure, that\u2019s all he does. Puts on pressure and throws big bombs, and he\u2019s fit to do it. So he looked pretty good.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s his style of fighting, that\u2019s what he\u2019s used to, putting on the pressure, throwing big punches, and he got David Price out of there.\n\n\u2018For me, if I was in the ring \u2013 and I wanted to be in the ring, I was watching with frustration thinking, \u201cDamn I wish I was there\u201d \u2013 if it was me I know I would have out-boxed him. And I know I would have caught him coming in, and I know I can put him out.\u2019\n\nChisora called out Parker in the ring but Haye prefers a fight with Usyk (Picture: Getty)\n\nThere have been suggestions that Chisora wants to fight Parker on the Joshua-Ruiz II undercard in Saudi Arabia in December and the Kiwi is up for the challenge, while he disregarded Haye\u2019s remarks about Usyk.\n\nParker added: \u2018I guess they\u2019re looking at all options, but personally I think he should fight me. It\u2019s a fight that we did make, obviously it\u2019s out of control what happened. Things happen in boxing, but we\u2019re ready when they\u2019re ready.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Joseph Parker is convinced he would not have suffered the same fate as David Price had he been fit to face Derek Chisora and is eager to finally take on...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1147405280_1572443372.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
