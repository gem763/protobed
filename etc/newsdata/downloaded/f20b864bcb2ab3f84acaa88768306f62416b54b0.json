Though she was self-conscious about her scars and her weight, she no longer obsessed over the gym and restricted her food.\n\nHayley later gave birth to twins, Ruby and Ramona, two, and Hayley finally felt at peace with her body as she realised that her family and husband Cody, 32, were what made her happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mum now feels proud of her body and what it has given her, and she\u2019s even started sharing photos of her postpartum body to Instagram with her loose skin on display.\n\nHayley hopes to be an inspiration to other mums to show them that they are not defined by their imperfections and can be comfortable in their own skin.\n\nShe struggled to come to terms with her loose skin (Picture: MDWfeatures / Hayley Garnet)\n\nHayley said: \u2018Before I became a mother, I actually struggled with an eating disorder. I would spend hours in the gym and starve myself for days on end. I truly felt like I was drowning in hatred for my body.\n\n\u2018I only expected to have one or two kids maximum, but my second pregnancy was a huge surprise \u2013 twin girls.\n\n\u2018After having my son almost six years ago I just felt so much different about my body after he was born. I was self-conscious of the scars and the weight, but I didn\u2019t revert back to eating disorder mode \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel important.\n\n\u2018Once I had my twin girls, I really felt even freer because I had realised what makes me truly happy and content in life, being grateful for the health and happiness of my kids and husband.\n\n\u2018Not only does my body look much different but it feels so different too. I actually struggle with diastasis recti (abdominal separation) and an umbilical hernia which both make life a bit difficult. Pelvic floor physical therapy is also something I try to advocate for because it really helps women to heal after pregnancy and birth.\n\nShe now loves the skin she\u2019s in (Picture: MDWfeatures / Hayley Garnet)\n\n\u2018I am so proud of my body. I\u2019m also frustrated by the limitations, but I am so amazed by everything my body has done to carry, birth and nurse my children. I am a petite woman who carried twin girls until 37-and-a-half weeks \u2013 I feel like a warrior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I got the idea to share my postpartum body back in November of 2017 right after I had my twin girls. I felt like the more I shared my truth, the less shame I would feel \u2013 and it worked.\u2019\n\nHayley shares her body positive pictures on Instagram and is often inundated with messages of love and support from other mums from all over the world.\n\n\u2018Oh my gosh my biggest hope is to be a positive inspiration for other mums,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t want anyone else to feel alone. I want the stigmas to end, and for us to feel comfortable being in our skin wearing what we want and not hiding away.\n\n\u2018The reactions I receive on social media are almost all positive. Some women love what I share but don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so themselves, but I\u2019m really trying to build a community for us and encourage the mainstream media to drop their notions on what makes a body worthy of love.\n\n\u2018The most difficult part of this journey is that it isn\u2019t a straight path to a destination. It\u2019s not linear and there will be bumps and hurdles. There are still some days that have me frowning at myself before I remember that my worth and beauty is not defined by my flaws or \u201cimperfections\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You are worthy. You are beautiful. You have grown. It\u2019s so important to work on ourselves and how we both speak and think about our bodies \u2013 we need to do this for our children \u2013 the future.\u2019\n\nBEAT If you suspect you, a family member or friend has an eating disorder, contact Beat on 0808 801 0677 or at help@beateatingdisorders.org.uk, for information and advice on the best way to get appropriate treatment\n\nMORE: Can cats, dogs and other pets eat pumpkin seeds?\n\nMORE: Woman creates amazing wedding dress out of colostomy bags to raise awareness of bowel cancer\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Instagram influencer Hayley Garnett is celebrating body positivity by showing her post-partum body and loose skin online.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92547303_1572099483.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
