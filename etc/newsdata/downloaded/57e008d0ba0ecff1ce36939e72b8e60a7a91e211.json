At least two other NBA events to be held Wednesday before the start of the China games were canceled as part of the fallout that started after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a since-deleted tweet last week that showed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cGiven the fluidity of the situation, today\u2019s media availability has been postponed,\u201d the league said. The sessions were not rescheduled Wednesday, though having them on Thursday \u2014 game day in Shanghai \u2014 remains possible.\n\nLater Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of lawmakers \u2014 including the rare alignment of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2014 sent a letter to Silver saying the NBA should show the \u201ccourage and integrity\u201d to stand up to the Chinese government. They asked the NBA to, among other things, suspend activities in China until what they called the selective treatment against the Rockets ends.\n\n\u201cYou have more power to take a stand than most of the Chinese government\u2019s targets and should have the courage and integrity to use it,\u201d the lawmakers told Silver. The NBA did not have any immediate comment on the letter, and it was unclear if Silver had even seen the document.\n\nIn Shanghai, the mood surrounding the game that \u2014 if played \u2014 will feature LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and other big NBA names was anything but festive. An NBA Cares event that was to benefit the Special Olympics was called off, as was a \u201cfan night\u201d celebration that was to be highlighted by the league announcing plans to refurbish some outdoor courts in that city. And workers in multiple spots around Shanghai were tearing down large outdoor promotional advertisements for Thursday\u2019s Lakers-Nets game.\n\nThe teams are also supposed to play Saturday in Shenzhen.\n\nChinese smartphone maker Vivo has joined the list of companies that have suspended ties with the NBA for now, only adding to the uncertainty surrounding the China games. Vivo was a presenting sponsor of the games, and on Wednesday there was no reference to the game in Shanghai on the list of upcoming events scheduled at Mercedes-Benz Arena. Other firms such as apparel company Li-Ning announced similar moves earlier this week, as the rift was just beginning.\n\nSilver said Tuesday in Tokyo that he supports Morey\u2019s right to free speech. Several Chinese companies have suspended their partnership with the NBA in recent days, and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it will not broadcast the Lakers-Nets games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d\n\nAll around China, stores that sell NBA merchandise were removing Rockets-related apparel from shelves and many murals featuring the Rockets \u2014 even ones with Yao Ming, the Chinese great who played for Houston during his NBA career \u2014 were being painted over.\n\nEffects are already being felt in NBA arenas, in a pair of games featuring Guangzhou Loong Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nAfter the playing of the Chinese national anthem in Washington on Wednesday before Guangzhou\u2019s game against the Wizards, one fan shouted, \u201cFreedom of expression! Freedom of speech! Free Hong Kong!\u201d Another fan shouted for a free Hong Kong from the second level during the second quarter.\n\nMinutes later, security approached one fan holding up a \u201cFree Tibet\u201d sign and another holding the Tibet flag. Security tried to take the sign, and the fan refused to give it up. Security then escorted them out of the seats.\n\nA similar scene played out in Philadelphia on Tuesday, also during a Guangzhou game. There, two fans were removed by arena security for holding signs and chanting in support of Hong Kong. The signs read \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cFree HK.\u201d The sentiment was not different from Morey\u2019s since-deleted tweet last week of an image that read, \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe 76ers and Wells Fargo Center, the team\u2019s home arena, released statements Wednesday confirming that the fan removal took place and explaining why.\n\n\u201cDuring the second quarter of last night\u2019s 76ers game, Wells Fargo Center security responded to a situation that was disrupting the live event experience for our guests,\u201d the arena\u2019s statement Wednesday said. \u201cAfter three separate warnings, the two individuals were escorted out of the arena without incident. The security team employed respectful and standard operating procedures.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is not the first major corporation to deal with criticism from China over political differences. Mercedes-Benz, Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott, fashion brand Zara and others also have found themselves in conflicts with China in recent years.\n\nAfter Morey\u2019s tweet was deleted, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the organization. Joe Tsai, who recently completed his purchase of the Nets and is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has said the damage to the NBA\u2019s relationship with China \u201cwill take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\n___\n\nReynolds reported from Miami.
