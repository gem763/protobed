If a coach is alone it's more difficult now.\n\n'Manchester United is an amazing club with an amazing story and for people around the world, it's difficult to understand what has happened to this club.'\n\nUnited CEO Ed Woodward is currently in charge of all football operations at the club\n\nUnited have made their worst start to a league season in 30 years and find themselves in 12th place in the Premier League with eight games played.\n\nCampos said working at Old Trafford was an attractive proposition, admitting that it would take a 'special situation' to convince him to leave his current job at Lille.\n\n'Of course I believe I could help Manchester United. I want to work with a big club one day.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer needs support to ease the burden of running the club, says Campos\n\nThe struggling Red Devils have made their worst start to a league season in 30 years\n\n'But the Lille project gives me big pleasure because when I arrived we were in difficulty. I am happy here \u2013 so only a special situation will make me change a project.'\n\nCampos, who was assistant manager to Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid, said he felt the Portuguese boss needed more support when he was at the United helm.\n\n'I speak to Jose every week, sometimes every day, and I saw that Jose, in my opinion, had difficulties in Manchester because the club has another culture, which I respect of course,' he added.\n\n'If the coach is alone he's an easy target and he needs help. Everyone needs help in football. You can't play alone.\n\n'It's important the club has one project and with a sporting director everyone understands where they go.'", "description": "The club's footballing operations are run by CEO Ed Woodward, although there had been rumours he was keen to bring a Director of Football on board to help manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19466772-0-image-a-56_1570575920302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
