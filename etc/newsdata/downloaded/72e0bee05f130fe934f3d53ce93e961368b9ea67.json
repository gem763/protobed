But the cartoon is from the 1940s, by the New York cartoonist Rube Goldberg, and it\u2019s on view as part of The Art of Rube Goldberg, a survey which opened this weekend and runs until 9 February.\n\nThe pioneering 20th-century artist created more than 50,000 cartoons in a career that spanned seven decades. This is the first retrospective in 49 years to look at Goldberg\u2019s work. It also highlights his overlooked career as a Pulitzer prize-winning political satirist.\n\n\u201cPolitical cartoons were not his main output, but some of his work remains so relevant,\u201d said the museum\u2019s assistant curator, Sophia Marisa Lucas. \u201cHe was seeking to find humor in some things, as a clever opportunity for relief.\u201d\n\nAs part of a traveling exhibition from the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, curated by Max Weintraub, the retrospective features Goldberg\u2019s views on society in the 1930s and 1940s, skewering Adolf Hitler, commenting on the inflation of the US dollar and addressing the dire effects of war.\n\nGoldberg wasn\u2019t primarily a satirist but made a significant impact with his political cartoons. He received a Pulitzer prize in 1948 for a drawing called Peace Today, showing an atomic bomb teetering towards the brink of destruction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rube Goldberg, Foolish Questions postcards, 1910. Illustration: Rube Goldberg\n\nGoldberg was born in San Francisco in 1883, moved to New York City in 1907 and got a job at the Evening Mail in 1908 with a cartoon series called Foolish Questions. It was based on the premise: \u201cAsk a stupid question, get a stupid answer.\u201d\n\nIn one cartoon, a woman asks her husband, who just came in from the rain: \u201cWhy, dearie, did you get wet?\u201d He answers: \u201cOf course not \u2013 the rain is dry today.\u201d The series was so popular, readers started mailing in their own foolish questions for Goldberg to answer in the series, which ended up in a book and merchandise such as a deck of cards.\n\n\u201cThe exhibition follows progression of his hand,\u201d said Lucas. From the cartoons he did at the beginning of his career, it segues into his social commentary. \u201cGoldberg commented primarily on human nature.\u201d\n\nThroughout the 1910s, Goldberg was a standup comedian in New York, toured with a troupe of comics for a vaudeville show and used slapstick in his cartoons. A new section in this particular exhibition is devoted to vaudeville \u2013 one of his biggest influences.\n\n\u201cWhat we did differently here, for this exhibition, was pull out another section on the influence of vaudeville on his work,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cIt\u2019s history that felt buried but had a significant influence.\u201d\n\nAs Goldberg\u2019s cartoons became syndicated by national newspapers in 1922, he started to earn $200,000 a year and reached an audience of millions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rube Goldberg, Professor Butts invention drawing (postage stamps), 1929. Ink on paper. Illustration: Rube Goldberg\n\nFrom 1914 to 1964, he ran a series called The Inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts. Before becoming a cartoonist, Goldberg studied engineering, and here put his knowledge to work. He turned seemingly useless tasks into complicated chain reaction invention machines (in one, a car gets a windshield wiper from a dog\u2019s wagging tail; in another, there\u2019s a 20-step way to brush your teeth).\n\nIt didn\u2019t stop on paper, either. Goldberg\u2019s invention machines made it to Hollywood. He created a feeding machine that allowed Charlie Chaplin to sip on soup without raising his arms in the 1936 film Modern Times.\n\nMuch later, his breakfast machines were featured in blockbuster films, including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, where a toy train pushes plates along a kitchen, while in Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure, a statue of Abraham Lincoln flips pancakes (which end up stuck to the ceiling).\n\nGoldberg didn\u2019t get into political cartoons until the 1930s. \u201cYou see signs of his political cartoons in his early work, but it\u2019s more about personality, bureaucracy, the human condition,\u201d said Lucas.\n\nIn 1938, when Goldberg was 55, he became the New York Sun\u2019s political cartoonist, producing three cartoons a week on topics including corruption, poverty and crime. \u201cThey weren\u2019t the latest news; it was reflections on tax cuts, the war, broad issues,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cNot urgent daily news.\u201d\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, he commented on government austerity throughout the second world war, primary elections, lying presidents and the Middle Eastern conflict. He showed an American taxpayer getting bonked on the head and compared vote counting to a carnival game. \u201cWhen all clerks are unconscious, the election is over,\u201d Goldberg wrote.\n\nOne cartoon from the 1940s, called The Numbers Blues, shows a man standing sheepishly under rows of numbers hovering above his head \u2013 from his phone number to social security and bank account \u2013 imagining himself as a jailbird.\n\n\u201cPolitical cartoons were easier for me than the inventions because they were almost pure idea and the draftsmanship was relatively simple,\u201d Goldberg once said, \u201cI could do two political cartoons a day, but an invention sometimes required a week.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rube Goldberg.

During the second world war, Goldberg faced intense criticism for his political cartoons and received a lot of hate mail. Since he was the son of a Jewish immigrant from Germany, he advised his two sons who lived with him in New York, George and Thomas, to change their surname from Goldberg to George.\n\nIn the last chapter of his newspaper career, Goldberg left the Sun in 1949 to become a cartoonist for the New York Journal, staying until his last cartoon was published in 1964, when he was 80.\n\nOnce drawing became too difficult in old age, he turned to sculpture. Along the way, he also made books and hosted his own radio and TV shows.\n\nThree weeks before he passed away in 1970, Goldberg had a retrospective at the National Museum of American History in Washington. Photos from the opening show the artist, aged 87, in a sharp suit and bow tie, white-haired and in black-rimmed glasses, chatting with guests alongside his wife. The exhibition was called Do It the Hard Way, and as one of his last masterpieces, he created a cartoon foretelling the future \u2013 in 2070, he predicted women would still be fighting for equal rights.\n\nThe walls were covered with Goldberg\u2019s drawings. Large cutouts of speech bubbles hovered above them, as if life itself were a cartoon.\n\n\u201cHe was a commercial cartoonist for major publications, maximizing the opportunity in the golden age of newspapers,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cBut his main goal is that he was a humorist.\u201d", "description": "The machine-making, cartoon-drawing Pulitzer prize-winner is the focus of a new exhibition, which also shines a light on the relevance of his political art", "authors": ["Nadja Sayej"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/865d1e2e76fdec6419da44e67b7904b683a38d2a/0_912_2965_1778/master/2965.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f30fee36bc83fb361fd3368fcc96661", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
