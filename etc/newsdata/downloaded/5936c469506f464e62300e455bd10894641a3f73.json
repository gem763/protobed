The United States was \u201cwaiting to hear from the kingdom\u201d for guidance on \u201cwhat terms we would proceed.\u201d It is rather odd that the legendarily isolationist president would put American military power at the disposal of a foreign power.\n\nThe American-Saudi relationship famously dates to a 1945 meeting between Franklin Roosevelt and King Saud aboard a battleship in the Suez canal. The alliance was founded on Saudi Arabia\u2019s possession of massive reservoirs of oil. But Saudi Arabia\u2019s value has diminished since then, and the United States is now a net exporter of oil.\n\nTrump himself used to frequently rail against American support for the kingdom. He expressed the same disdain for Saudi Arabia as he did for all American allies \u2014 they were a bunch of leeches getting rich off American generosity:\n\nSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won't, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2014\n\nBut now Trump has come around to a different line of thinking. The Saudis don\u2019t owe America for defending them. Americans owes the Saudis for the privilege of selling them advanced weaponry. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a great ally,\u201d gushed the president,\n\nThey spend $400 billion in our country over the last number of years. Four hundred billion dollars. That\u2019s a million and a half jobs. And they\u2019re not ones that, unlike some countries, where they want terms; they want terms and conditions. They want to say, \u201cCan we borrow the money at zero percent for the next 400 years?\u201d No. No. Saudi Arabia pays cash.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Saudi Arabia purchases weaponry from the United States, though the actual amount is nowhere near $400 billion (which would be more than half the Pentagon\u2019s annual budget). But this transaction is not an act of generosity for hard-pressed American arms manufacturers. The Saudis are being given access to advanced arms that many countries would love to have.\n\nThe Saudis have been purchasing American weapons \u2014 with cash \u2014 for decades. That\u2019s the nature of the relationship. It\u2019s not clear why Trump has decided to stop seeing U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia as a favor to the Saudis and start seeing them as a favor to the U.S.\n\nWhat makes Trump\u2019s logic so peculiar is that it turns the mechanism through which the alliance works into its rationale. We used to sell weapons to Saudia Arabia because we needed to secure their oil. Now we supposedly need to defend them because they buy our weapons.\n\nThe largest mystery hovering over Trump\u2019s reversal is not how much the Saudis are paying the United States, but how much they\u2019re paying Trump personally. The Saudis spend extravagant sums of money at his hotels in Washington and New York. Earlier this summer, a Saudi entourage of more than two dozen stayed at Trump\u2019s resort in Scotland. These are just some details that have leaked out piecemeal. The overall scope of Trump\u2019s financial ties to the kingdom are opaque, because Trump, with the support of the conservative movement and Republicans in Congress, refuses to disclose basic financial information.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly easy to imagine that Saudi lobbyists persuaded Trump to reverse his longstanding skepticism of the alliance through sheer force of argument. Trump changes his mind all the time, not always through money changing hands.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump is rattling his saber on behalf of an ally that whose value once trashed, and which is now paying him unknown sums, on the basis of a rationale that on its face makes no sense at all.", "description": "Two days ago, President Trump declared the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a retaliatory strike on Iran for its attack on a Saudi oil facility.
