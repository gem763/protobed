But Uber immediately signaled defiance, saying it didn\u2019t plan to change its practices in response to the measure.\n\nThe legislation, which intends to force companies to reclassify certain contract workers as employees, is considered a serious threat to Uber and Lyft, already losing billions of dollars a year combined, as their business models have relied on flexible labor and minimal worker costs.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage in the state Assembly on Wednesday, after the state Senate\u2019s passage the night before, reflects the degree to which the large Democratic majority in Sacramento has increased scrutiny of tech companies in recent years, as well as the strength of labor unions in the state.\n\nGiven California\u2019s size and history of creating influential business regulations, it also is the first significant step in a new paradigm for a changing workforce, fueled by people who have forgone benefits for the sake of flexibility and occasional incentives.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has said he would sign a bill if it gets to his desk.\n\nBoth ride-hailing companies have relied on drivers who earn wages based on the rides they complete versus the hours they work, and who have been responsible for their own car expenses. Under the bill, known as Assembly Bill 5, the drivers could be entitled to benefits that include a minimum hourly wage and workers\u2019 compensation.\n\nThe bill requires companies that want to treat a worker as a contractor prove that the worker is independent and free to perform the services provided without company control, that those services are outside the employer\u2019s usual course of business, and that the contractor works independently in the same type of business as the contracted work.\n\nUber and Lyft had worked together to try to exempt themselves from the bill, saying it could upend their businesses. Lyft said in a message to its drivers Wednesday that they \u201cmay soon be required to drive specific shifts, stick to specific areas, and drive for only a single platform.\u201d\n\nBut Tony West, Uber\u2019s chief legal officer, said Wednesday that while the bill inserts a new legal test into California labor law over how to classify a worker, it doesn\u2019t automatically reclassify drivers and the company will continue to respond to claims of worker misclassification in arbitration and in court.\n\n\u201cContrary to some of the rhetoric we\u2019ve heard, AB5 does not automatically reclassify any ride-share drivers from independent contractors to employees,\u201d Mr. West said in a call with reporters after the legislation passed. \u201cAB5 does not provide drivers with benefits, nor does it give drivers the right to organize. In fact, the bill currently says nothing about ride-share drivers.\u201d\n\nAnticipating Uber\u2019s stance, lawmakers in Sacramento added increased enforcement mechanisms last week allowing for some city and district attorneys to enforce the bill, an addition Uber fought hard in the capitol this week.\n\nIn a news conference held after the bill\u2019s passage, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the bill\u2019s author, said the enforcement methods were added after Mr. West came to her office and expressed Uber\u2019s position that it wouldn\u2019t reclassify its workforce and settle challenges through arbitration and other means.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Will this bill make working for ride-sharing companies more or less attractive? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cI thought a lot about that conversation and thought how unfair it is for any company in California to sit in a legislator\u2019s office and say we don\u2019t care what you do, we\u2019re going to break the law,\u201d she said.\n\nAnalysts say Uber and Lyft could be forced to introduce hourly schedules and a minimum wage for drivers in California. Drivers who work 40 hours or more\u2014or the equivalent of full-time jobs\u2014could be entitled to further benefits.\n\nWith Lyft making its Wall Street debut, WSJ's Lee Hawkins outlines the three biggest challenges the ride-hailing service will face in the next 12 months.

Raising fares could weaken ridership, and costs could multiply if other states enact similar rules.\n\nIn New York City, where influential union groups are pushing for similar legislation, Uber and Lyft raised prices this year after a new minimum-wage law was enacted. Daily rides for Uber and Lyft have since fallen, according to data from New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission.\n\n\u201cConsumers could look at alternatives\u201d if rates rise, said Brent Thill, of investment bank Jefferies Group, which estimates Lyft\u2019s California business accounts for 15% to 20% of its revenue. \u201cThey may go back to taking a taxi.\u201d\n\nUber and Lyft have said the bill would take away flexibility for drivers, who currently work when they want and can earn more when demand spikes. Lyft, which says it has roughly 325,000 drivers in California, said scheduling drivers would result in fewer jobs.\n\n\u201cAlready the message of these companies is that riders will have to bear most of the expenses,\u201d said Tom White, with financial services firm D.A. Davidson & Co. \u201cYou\u2019ll see companies lean in on optimizing on prices.\u201d\n\nUber and Lyft rose to prominence this decade by popping up unannounced in cities throughout the U.S. and quickly signing up drivers. Many joined the services as a way to earn extra cash and work on nights and weekends. Lyft has said 91% of its drivers drive fewer than 20 hours a week.\n\nWhile offering flexibility, the model is dogged by high turnover from drivers who report making only a handful of dollars on trips. Economists have estimated Uber and Lyft drivers earn on average between $9 and $16 an hour, after accounting for gas, maintenance and other expenses the contractors are responsible for. Both Uber and Lyft say drivers take more than 70% of fares, including incentives.\n\nThe companies over time have introduced new programs to make drivers happier. Uber has added payments for lengthy wait times and in-app tipping, while Lyft is opening a handful of driver centers with services such as discounted oil changes. But many drivers have remained unsatisfied. Throughout California\u2019s legislative session this year, drivers have joined other gig workers in Sacramento to rally at the capitol.\n\nUber lost more than $5.2 billion during its most recent quarter, while Lyft loss $644 million. Both companies\u2019 stock prices have remained far below their initial public offerings completed earlier this year.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, California Gov. Newsom indicated the state would remain involved in talks with Uber and Lyft regarding a deal. \u201cThese remain ongoing negotiations,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, \u201cand regardless of what happens with AB5, I am committed, at least, to continuing those negotiations.\u201d\n\nDuring the two days of floor debates in both houses of the state legislature, some Democrats took direct aim at the gig economy, indicating they may have no interest in any future compromise.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, there is nothing innovative about underpaying somebody for their labor, or basing an entire business model on misclassifying workers,\u201d said Sen. Maria Elena-Durazo, who was formerly a prominent labor activist from Los Angeles.\n\nIn August, Uber, Lyft and delivery service DoorDash Inc. promised to spend a combined $90 million on a ballot measure in next year\u2019s election if a deal couldn\u2019t be struck with lawmakers on the bill.\n\nThe companies had proposed enacting a minimum wage for drivers of $21 an hour, as well as a fund to pay for benefits such as sick leave and for workers to create organized groups within the companies. Talks stalled against opposition from labor unions.\n\n\u201cShort term this a headwind,\u201d said Mr. Thill, of Jefferies. \u201cBut long term it\u2019s not if they prove to labor leaders that this is destructive to the economy. Everyone right now is focusing on a worst- case scenario.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com and Sebastian Herrera at Sebastian.Herrera@wsj.com", "description": "California passed landmark employment legislation that challenges the business model of such gig-economy companies as ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft.
