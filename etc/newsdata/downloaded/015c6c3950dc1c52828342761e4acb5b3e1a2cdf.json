That was above its 10-year average of 6.4 and up 10% from the reading of September 2018.\n\nAmong experts surveyed, 29% believe the art market will go up in the next six months, versus 51% who said the same in May 2019.\n\nThe decline in the market confidence is a result of the global political and economic uncertainty, including heightened risks of Brexit and the U.S. trade war with China. Meanwhile, the lack of transparency, as well as prevalence of speculative behavior in the art market, are also major concerns from collectors, the report said.\n\nThis year\u2019s report, the sixth edition of Deloitte\u2019s Art & Finance Report, is based on surveys of 54 private banks, 25 family offices, and 138 art professionals, from April to June 2019.\n\nIn addition to the global art market trend, the report also dealt with topics including art and wealth management, art-secured lending, art as an investment, art and technology, and risk management.", "description": "Auction sales were down 20.3% in the first half of 2019, Deloitte reports", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-116792/social", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
