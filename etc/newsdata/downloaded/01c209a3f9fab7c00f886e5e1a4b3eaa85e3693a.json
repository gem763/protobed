We therefore concluded on that basis that the claim was misleading and in breach of the Code.\"\n\nElisa Allen, director at PETA, described that ASA's ruling as \"both confusing and disappointing\".\n\nAllen continued: \"Nevertheless, we'll continue to urge decent people to steer clear of wool, and we have plans to run a modified version of the ad in numerous cities this winter.\"", "description": "An advertisement for animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has been banned for claiming that \u201cwool is just as cruel as fur\u201d.
