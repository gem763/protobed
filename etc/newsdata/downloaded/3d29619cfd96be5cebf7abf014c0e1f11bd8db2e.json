But he said Mr. Trump chose it anyway because administration officials had considered hotels throughout the country, and concluded that the Trump National Doral was \u201cby far and away, far and away, the best physical facility for this meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told reporters, quoting what he said an unnamed official told him during the planning process. And he dismissed any suggestion that the president would profit from the choice.\n\nMr. Mulvaney said the hotel would put on the summit \u201cat cost.\u201d \u201cI think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he got here that he doesn\u2019t profit from being here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has no interest in profit from being here.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event,\u201d the acting White House chief of staff said, dismissing questions over the propriety of the president\u2019s picking his own hotel.", "authors": ["Katie Rogers", "Eric Lipton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/us/politics/17dc-g7/merlin_159850590_7a0c2a6a-d1d9-4e3a-b0fc-09d5c62597d2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
