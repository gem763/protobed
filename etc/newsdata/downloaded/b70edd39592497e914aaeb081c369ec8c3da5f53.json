Last year\u2019s summer heat wave in Europe, and high temperatures again this year, led to a fall in holiday demand.\n\nThe company reported a \u00a31.5 billion ($1.75 billion) loss in the first half of the financial year, including a \u00a31.1 billion loss following its decision to write down the value of My Travel, which it merged with in 2007. It predicted further headwinds and claimed that Brexit had led to customers delaying holiday plans.\n\nWhat\u2019s new.\n\nThomas Cook confirmed on Monday that it had entered compulsory liquidation after failing to secure a further \u00a3200 million over the weekend.\n\nChief executive Peter Fankhauser, who has taken home more than \u00a38 million in remuneration since taking over in 2014, said it was a \u201cmatter of profound regret.\u201d\n\nThe government-backed Civil Aviation Authority has stepped in to undertake an \u201cemergency operation\u201d to repatriate an estimated 150,000 Brits stranded abroad.\n\nPackage holiday rival Tui\u2019s stock soared 7.5%, despite a small number of holidays with flights booked on Thomas Cook\u2019s airline being affected.\n\nLow-cost airlines also took off on Monday, with easyJet climbing 3.4% and Ryanair lifting 1.1% after Thomas Cook\u2019s final passenger flight came into land for the final time.\n\nMoving forward.\n\nIntense competition has squeezed airlines and travel operators in recent years, and Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse will alleviate overcapacity in the industry.\n\nHowever, greater problems face the sector, including falling holiday demand and the rise of online booking companies.\n\nPlatforms, such as AirBnB and apps for car hire and flights, have allowed consumers to book each aspect of their holiday separately.\n\nIt will take more than the demise of Thomas Cook to inject some much need life back into travel operator industry in the long term.", "description": "Travel operator Tui and low cost airlines soared on Monday after Britain\u2019s oldest travel agent Thomas Cook collapsed.", "authors": ["Callum Keown"], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-DF694_Thomas_SOC_20190923060315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
