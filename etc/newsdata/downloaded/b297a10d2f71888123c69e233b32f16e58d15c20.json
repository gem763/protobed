He was so strong throughout all of it,\" said O'Malley, who met Woodward in law school. \"He said he would drop out of law school to be with me in Houston.\"\n\nWoodward proposed to O'Malley in October 2017, after they had both graduated from law school and moved to Houston together to begin the rest of their lives.\n\nJust over a year after they got engaged, in December 2018, Woodward started noticing that he had trouble chewing and talking, and had extreme soreness in his muscles.\n\n\"I went to Ohio to visit my family for Christmas and when I flew back my speech was so slurred that Lauren couldn\u2019t understand me and thought I\u2019d had a stroke,\" Woodward said. \"She took me to the emergency room.\"\n\nWoodward was sent to MD Anderson, where O'Malley had been treated, and was told he had a five-inch thymoma tumor in his chest, according to Dr. Sudhakar Tummala, who treated Woodward.\n\nLike O'Malley, Woodward had clean margins when his tumor was removed, so he did not have to undergo radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nBut his tumor caused his body to create antibodies that attack healthy proteins, resulting in myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease that causes extreme muscle weakness, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nWoodward was hospitalized for a month after the tumor was removed in January, including spending several weeks in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a feeding tube and oxygen. He has been hospitalized a few times since and still has to undergo plasma treatments to help him regain his energy, according to Tummala.\n\nBy his side through it all was O'Malley.\n\nCourtesy Lauren OMalley\n\n\"It was very much my turn to take care of him,\" she said. \"It felt insane that we were back in this place of cancer having control over our lives, but I tried to serve him like he did me nearly three years before.\"\n\nWoodward is still on medical leave from his job and used his time recovering to plan for his wedding day, including setting milestones like being strong enough to dance at the wedding.\n\n\"[Planning for the wedding] has been in many ways the thing that has given us hope and something to look forward to,\" said O'Malley. \"Jake has been more involved than any groom that people helping with our wedding have ever known.\"\n\n\"This wedding is a chance to celebrate that he is alive and he is walking and talking and can even dance,\" she said.\n\nJosh & Dana Fernandez\n\nWoodward said he knew O'Malley was his perfect partner in life before either of them got sick, but the obstacles they've overcome together continue to prove that she is \"the one\" for him.\n\n\"She was told that she was dying and she just handled it like such a champ and was so amazing and then the way she has taken care of me through this year has just shown me she is the kind of person you know you can depend on,\" Woodward said of his now-wife. \"She is so nurturing but she is also so fierce and a fighter.\"\n\n\"A lot of people aren\u2019t tested this way before they get married so they don\u2019t know how they or their partner would react in those scenarios,\" he added. \"One silver lining of this is we know we can count on each other. We know we\u2019re not going to run away. We\u2019re all in on this.\"", "description": "Lauren O'Malley and Jake Woodward celebrated being alive at their Houston wedding.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/wedding-ht-er-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
