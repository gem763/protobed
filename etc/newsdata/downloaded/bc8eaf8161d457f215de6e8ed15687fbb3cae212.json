I knew about her relationship with Liverpool before, but I didn't watch it last night, I saw it in the newspapers this morning. Well, well done.\n\n\"The German headlines are not too bad as well, because the guy who won the competition is from Mainz, a 21-year-old. So, a big day for these two wonderful athletes. Really great.\"\n\nKlopp was asked for his own sporting inspirations after being told Johnson-Thompson had been inspired by his side's Champions League semi-final win over Barcelona last season.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
