(Sarel van der Walt/Netwerk24)\n\nMmusi Maimane, who resigned on Tuesday as leader of the offical opposition, was recruited into the DA a decade ago. He didn\u2019t grow up in the tradition of the party and its forbears \u2013 the Democratic Party, Progressive Federal Party or the United Party \u2013 and was a staunch supporter of the ANC until much later in his life.\n\nDespite his meteoric rise in the party, elevated from newly joined ordinary member to parliamentary leader in less than four years, he was another victim of the organisation\u2019s obsession with identifying and fast-tracking talented black politicians into senior positions in order to become more acceptable to the country\u2019s largest and most influential group of voters: the black electorate.\n\nHe followed in the footsteps of Lindiwe Mazibuko, who became parliamentary leader at the age of 31, only to resign shortly before the 2014 general election ahead of losing a referendum on her leadership. Maimane replaced her and became a project of then-DA leader Helen Zille.\n\n\"The ANC worked very hard under former presidents Mandela and Mbeki. We were on track. In fact, in 1999 I still voted for the ANC.\" \u2013 Maimane in an interview with Marida Fitzpatrick of Beeld, August 25, 2013\n\nHe appeared on the scene shortly before the municipal election in 2011 but became a national political figure ahead of the 2014 general election, when he was appointed national spokesperson for the DA \u2013 which enhanced his visibility \u2013 as well as the party\u2019s candidate for premier in the province.\n\nIt was clear at the time that he was being groomed for a bigger stage, and Zille\u2019s project to add racial and gender diversity to the party\u2019s leadership structures was gaining traction. Along with Patricia de Lille and Mazibuko, the party\u2019s most visible leadership positions were occupied by women, two of them black and coloured respectively.\n\nMaimane, who impressed in his public appearances early on as articulating the party \u2013 and Zille\u2019s \u2013 vision of an \"open opportunity society for all\u201d \u2013 clearly, was becoming the main subject in the leadership\u2019s attempts to \"grow our own timber\".\n\n\"For you, Honourable President, are not an honourable man. You are a broken man, presiding over a broken society.\" \u2013 Maimane, in his reply to the State of the Nation Address by then president Jacob Zuma, February 17, 2015\n\nBy the time he stood opposite then-president Jacob Zuma in early 2015, the ANC was easy pickings. It was fatally embroiled in grand corruption and had to fend off scandal after scandal, with the Nkandla debacle quickly followed by regular revelations about the Gupta family and the emergence of state capture.\n\nMaimane took over the parliamentary leadership from Mazibuko and, under the guidance and prodding of Zille, proceeded to clear out a dysfunctional caucus leadership. John Steenhuisen became his chief whip and confidante, and the party\u2019s backroom operations were re-staffed and beefed up by a number of talented young officials and MPs.\n\nAt full throttle in the National Assembly. He won plaudits for his \"broken man\" speech in 2015, when he launched a scathing attack on then president Jacob Zuma. (Lerato Maduna, Netwerk24)\n\n\n\nMaimane\u2019s \"broken man speech\" was undoubtedly the highlight of his parliamentary career. He flayed at the ANC\u2019s dishonesty and corruption and reduced the normally unperturbed Zuma to nervously twitching about in his front bench.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t see that I am a black man\u201a then you don\u2019t know me at all.\" \u2013 Maimane, on his election as DA leader, May 10, 2015\n\nIn April, two months after the media and analysts praised Maimane for his tour de force during the opening of Parliament, Zille stepped down as DA leader because of her fears that the party wasn\u2019t moving quickly enough down the road of introducing black leaders. Athol Trollip, who was ousted by Zille\u2019s original great black hope, Mazibuko, refused to stand back in favour of a black candidate for federal chairperson, while James Selfe was still ensconced as chairperson of the federal council.\n\nZille, who tried to reconcile her commitment to non-racialism with the need to shape and cultivate black leaders to take over the party, opted to promote Maimane\u2019s candidature instead, and helped secure an overwhelming victory in May of that year.\n\nBut whereas Zille attempted to remain true to the party\u2019s views and values on race \u2013 i.e. that it should not be a determinant of progress, redress, disadvantage or advantage \u2013 Maimane immediately made his race the focus of his personal political philosophy.\n\nMaimane is congratulated by Helen Zille on his election as DA leader in May 2015. She worked hard to ensure his victory. (Gallo Images)\n\nInitial consensus was that Maimane must be given the space to grow into the role of DA leader, with the accompanying history and ideology, and that his approach, if he could marry it with the party\u2019s central ideological tenets, could be a pragmatic way of positioning the party as more palatable to hitherto reluctant black voters.\n\nDuring Maimane\u2019s tenure a number of young, black party members came to the fore and started occupying more starring roles in his parliamentary caucus. The party was undergoing rapid change and Zille\u2019s vision of an \"open opportunity society for all\" was soon replaced with a nebulous theory about \"one South Africa for all\".\n\nMaimane also wasn\u2019t afraid to flirt with the ANC and the governing party\u2019s history, showing vocal admiration for Mbeki and later on laying claim to Nelson Mandela as one of the country\u2019s most revered sons \u2013 something which drew mockery from inside and outside the DA.\n\n\"That mandate is not for us to work for DA people, that mandate is to deliver for the city and therefore I will be tasking the team there to make sure they work hard.\" \u2013 Maimane declaring victory in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality after municipal elections, August 4, 2016\n\nIf the \"broken man speech\" was his personal highlight, then the DA\u2019s bullocking performance in the local government election of 2016 was the zenith of the organisation\u2019s performance during his tenure.\n\nExploiting the national outrage and anger about state capture, the party fulfilled the vision set by Zille, which was to break out of the Western Cape and become a party of government in the northern parts of the country.\n\nThanks to the ANC crumbling under the weight of the Zuma government\u2019s corruption, and with the aid of partners in the EFF and other minority parties, it took charge of the mayoralties of Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Pretoria.\n\nFor Maimane it was a triumph \u2013 although the success in Gauteng wasn\u2019t bargained or budgeted for. The DA scrambled to identify enough competent officials to deploy to Tshwane and Johannesburg, even considering the idea of leaving those cities to the ANC. In the end the lure of power was just took much, and the party plunged head-first into stormy arrangements with Julius Malema\u2019s EFF.\n\nMaimane decided the gambit was worth it, even recruiting a businessman with unknown political convictions, Herman Mashaba, to take the reins as eGoli mayor.\n\n\"We felt that it was crucial that Helen Zille should apologise to the people of South Africa which she had, and must step away from all leadership roles of the party... I believe it is the best way to deal with reconciliation project if we are going to have that project succeed.\" \u2013 Maimane in an interview with Stephen Grootes on Talk Radio 702, June 13, 2017\n\nAmid trying to make the three newly acquired metro municipalities working, his relationship with Zille started to fray. They first came into conflict with the emergence of the #FeesMustFall movement two years earlier, with Zille agitating for a more intolerant line against violent students, and Maimane comparing their protest with the heroics of the 1976 Soweto uprising.\n\nAnd although she was still a party doyenne as premier of the Western Cape, it was clear that they differed on the way forward. For Maimane a closer alignment with ANC type redress policies was the answer, and for Zille a dogma of strict non-racialism was the only way.\n\nMaimane explains the deal he reached with a stoney-faced Zille after her infamous tweets about colonialism in 2017. (Gallo Images)\n\nWhen Zille, after an official visit to Singapore, tweeted about how the legacy of colonialism wasn\u2019t all negative, Maimane saw a grand opportunity to neuter Zille and finally take charge of the party. She reluctantly recanted on live television about her remarks \u2013 construed as an apology for apartheid \u2013 and agreed to step down from all party structures and restrict her public statements to the provincial government.\n\nIt was a big moment in Maimane\u2019s attempt to mould the party into his vision.\n\n\"The clause around diversity not only says the party must strive, but that it must actively go out to promote diversity.\" \u2013 Maimane, at the DA\u2019s federal congress, after his attempts to change the party\u2019s constitution was rejected, April 9, 2018.\n\nEmboldened after the municipal election and in the wake of Zille\u2019s banishment, Maimane decided to go a step further: he wanted to entrench his vision for diversity and representation in the DA\u2019s leadership ranks in the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nWhilst trying to keep coherence in party policy, Maimane wanted a clause inserted to the effect that the party will ensure racial diversity in its leadership ranks. His opponents however defeated his attempts, arguing that racial quotas or appointments made on the basis of demography was anathema to the organisation\u2019s raison d\u2019etre, and a watered down clause committing the party to promote diversity was adopted.\n\nThe cracks had started to show.\n\n\"Nobody\u2026no leader enters a race looking for a loss. We could have succumbed to populism narratives \u2026 Even though we\u2019ve lost some votes, I can guarantee you that we held the centre.\" \u2013 Maimane at the results operational centre in Pretoria on May 10, 2019\n\nThe party was ill-prepared for the end of the Zuma presidency. Maimane got swept up in the national sense of relief with the election of President Cyril Ramaphosa in February 2018 and was reluctant to attack the new president for fear of alienating exhaling and content South Africans, positively numb after years of corruption.\n\nBut frustration was growing in his inner circle, with some saying that the momentum that was built up over the last two years ebbing away quickly because of Maimane\u2019s indecisiveness in how to approach Ramaphosa, who was billed as the country\u2019s saviour. The DA, used to pummeling the inept and corrupted Zuma, was unable to launch against Ramaphosa, and Maimane was being blamed for the party\u2019s inertia.\n\nThe results of the general election were an abject disaster.\n\nIt could neither gain the support of new black voters, nor could it retain all of the support of its traditional voters. Shedding almost half a million votes, the party was in shock in the immediate aftermath, dismissing lost votes as \u201cracial nationalists\u201d who don\u2019t belong in the party, and styling the result as a \u201cwinning loss\u201d.\n\nIt failed to launch in Gauteng, the country\u2019s most valuable province and the most vulnerable to takeover, and its Northern Cape efforts came to nought. In a low-turnout election, the DA\u2019s support shrunk \u2013 the first time in a quarter of a century it lost voters in a general election.\n\nBut the malaise ran deep. The party\u2019s election campaign was built on a hastily compiled manifesto that tried to be everything for everyone, without being something tangible for someone. Its approach to black economic empowerment was in flux, with internal divisions preventing a coherent policy from taking shape, while its economic policy was dragged by analysts and opponents alike.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Helen Zille on her election as chairperson of federal council, and I look forward to the new energy, ideas and vigour that Helen will bring to the leadership collective of the party.\" \u2013 Maimane on the election of Zille as chairperson of the DA\u2019s federal council, October 20, 2019\n\nA subsequent party review panel identified Maimane\u2019s leadership as the single most important reason for the DA\u2019s tribulations, and said although he\u2019s passionate and committed, he is also indecisive and doesn\u2019t like confrontation. This led to policy drift and uncertainty, as well as internal dysfunction and distrust.\n\nMaimane looking defeated next to Zille after her dramatic return to active DA politics in October 2019. (Sarel van der Walt/Netwerk24)\n\nThe review coincided with the dramatic return of Zille to the national stage when she was elected as chairperson of the DA\u2019s federal council, a powerful position where she was put in charge of the party\u2019s operations.\n\nIt was a massive blow to Maimane, who followed a pragmatic, flexible approach to party ideology by putting growth among black voters at the centre of his agenda. This was clearly at odds with significant power blocs inside the party \u2013 who backed Zille\u2019s return \u2013 who were convinced that Maimane was moving too fast, too quickly and too far away from the party\u2019s founding ethos.\n\nIn the end he was unable to materially change, position and unite the party for growth under his self-proclaimed pragmatic vision of embracing an approach to race that isn\u2019t traditional DA policy.\n\nPerhaps it was a function of being thrust into the role unprepared and too early, and an unwillingness to forge a shared, practical and attainable vision.\n\nBut it might also reveal a party unwilling to embrace the future and a refusal do what needs to be done in order to obtain power.", "description": "Despite his meteoric rise in the party, elevated from newly joined ordinary member to parliamentary leader in less than four years, Mmusi Maimane was another victim of the organisation's obsession with identifying and fast-tracking talented black politicians into senior positions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2872/665ace34b9de419ea150df74648a9db9.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
