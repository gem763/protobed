'Small businesses remain underserved,' Desai said (no problem with that statement, he's dead right).\n\n'Our platform allows them to access the finance they need in a fast and affordable way, whilst at the same time opening up a stable and attractive asset class to a broad range of investors.' (Here, I'm not so sure).\n\nSeven years ago, I invested \u00a3200 with Funding Circle. I did it as a personal finance experiment \u2013 to see whether peer-to-peer lending passed muster as a new asset class, sitting somewhere between cash and shares on the risk scale.\n\nOn one level, I've done OK. My \u00a3200, invested across a broad range of businesses, has grown in value to \u00a3270.21.\n\nThere have been a few bad debts along the way \u2013 businesses failing, resulting in the loss of the money I've lent them and the stream of interest payments I was due \u2013 but I've done better than if I had stuck the \u00a3200 in a savings account with a high street bank.\n\nBut my \u00a3270.21 is not as accessible or attainable as I thought it would be. Far from it. Late last month, I thought I would sever my relationship with Funding Circle (experiment over) and put my money to use elsewhere (Premium Bonds).\n\nYet getting money back is like pulling teeth. I have two options.First, I can 'turn off' my lending and allow the business loans I have made to run their course.\n\nThis means I will receive my money back through a series of monthly repayments.\n\nBut this will take forever \u2013 more than five years \u2013 and, of course, some of the loans could go bad in the meantime.\n\nIn other words, I may not get back \u00a3270.21. Alternatively, I can ask Funding Circle to find a buyer for my loans.\n\nThe price for pursuing this route is that I will only receive an 'estimated' \u00a3246.72.\n\nAlso, it could take four months or more before I get my money (this detail was only forthcoming after I pressed the company for it).\n\nOn Friday, Funding Circle told me it was looking to improve the way investors can access their funds. Too right it should be.\n\nAt the moment, its business model does not treat sellers fairly. No wonder its share price remains in the doldrums.\n\nHave you had problems investing in peer-to-peer lenders?
