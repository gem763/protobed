The former Baptist preacher believed that the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol and, presumably fatigued from his walk, realised he could deploy the power of Britain\u2019s flourishing rail network to help spread the word. Addressing the temperance meeting, he suggested that a train be hired to carry the movement\u2019s supporters to the next meeting in Loughborough. Thus, on 5 July 1841, some 500 passengers travelled by a special train for the 24-mile round trip, paying a shilling apiece. Over the next few years, Cook laid on ever more trains, introducing thousands of Britons to train travel for the first time. The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845. Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India. His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885. John\u2019s three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook & Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel. Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain\u2019s railway companies, effectively a nationalisation. But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972. Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers. It nearly collapsed in 2011 but averted its demise with a bailout deal funded by banks. Now, after 178 years of operation, it has ceased trading.\n\nThe affair has laid bare differences in approaches between the Tories and Labour towards state intervention, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, blaming the government\u2019s \u201cideological bias\u201d for its decision not to intervene.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s intervention could have enabled us to just stabilise the situation, give a breathing space so that there could be proper consultation with the workforce in particular about how to go forward,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\n\u201cTo just stand to one side and watch this number of jobs go and so many holidaymakers have their holiday ruined, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise government.\u201d\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, described the government\u2019s position as \u201creckless\u201d and said it should have stepped in to take an equity stake.\n\nThe refusal to intervene was also condemned by trade unions, who insisted the cost of bringing stranded Thomas Cook customers home from holidays abroad would dwarf the amount of taxpayer support requested by the firm.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a mathematical genius to know it would have been cheaper and more cost-effective to save what is a cornerstone of the British high street,\u201d said Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association.\n\nThe Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said the government\u2019s \u201cdo nothing\u201d attitude \u201chad left workers and customers high and dry while landing taxpayers with a bill of hundreds of millions of pounds\u201d.\n\nIn a round of morning media interviews, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the operation to repatriate customers would cost \u00a3100m, less than the sum requested by Thomas Cook.\n\n\u201cThe company were asking for up to \u00a3250m, they needed about \u00a3900m on top of that and they have got debts of \u00a31.7bn, so the idea of just spending taxpayers\u2019 money on that just wasn\u2019t really a goer,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.\n\n\u201cI think the problem of putting money into it, apart from the fact governments don\u2019t usually go around investing in travel companies, is that it may have just stretched things out for a couple of weeks and we could have been exactly where we started.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson defends decision not to step in as Labour says more should have been done", "authors": ["Ben Quinn", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebdb9ff6ab2668d71a54ab8649605307e1b894e0/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d995b4dfb73d80e445873a30ed9a8934", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
