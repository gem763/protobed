Neither she, Paul Rudd, nor myself have aged since 1996. I love ya fake mama! #objectofmyaffection [sic].\u2019\n\nIf we had photos of Jennifer, we\u2019d also post in her honour.\n\nThe photo had an infant Sarah being held by her fake dad Paul and she\u2019s right, all three haven\u2019t aged a single day.\n\nWhat\u2019s their secret?\n\nJennifer finally joined the world of Instagram yesterday, sharing with us an insight into her recent Friends reunion.\n\nThe actress wasted no time in giving the people what they want, as she shared a shot from a recent get together with her former sitcom co-stars as they gathered around her camera in a living room during recent celebrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreviously Courteney Cox (who played Monica) shared a shot of her hanging with Matt LeBlanc (Joey) and Jen (Rachel), as the three caught up.\n\nWe soon found out the whole cast, along with Matthew Perry (Chandler), David Schwimmer (Ross) and Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe) were also present, hiding on the other side of the lens. From her freshly verified account on Tuesday afternoon, Jen wrote alongside a very, very swell selfie: \u2018And now we\u2019re Instagram FRIENDS too. HI INSTAGRAM,\u2019 alongside a waving emoji.\n\nSomebody explain why Matthew is barely in the photo please (Picture: Instagram)\n\nTurns out it\u2019s actually really hard to fit six people into a selfie\u2026\n\nJen joining Instagram wasn\u2019t enough for fans to not mock her for her questionable camera quality.\n\nOne fan posted: \u2018Is it just me or is Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Friends reunion pic a first draft selfie at best? Bad framing, obstructed faces, weird limbs\u2026 this moment deserved a retake.\u2019\n\nIn her defence, she\u2019s Jennifer Aniston and she amassed almost nine million followers with a bad phone camera, so who\u2019s the real winner here?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
