The First Amendment is first for a reason. Second Amendment is just in case the First one doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nMr. Chappelle argued that only the U.S. \u201ccould produce this many comedians\u201d but that comedy is needed now more than ever in such a tense political climate.\n\n\u201cWe got to let some air out of the ball, man,\u201d he said, The Hill reported. \u201cThe country\u2019s getting a little tight. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s ever felt in my lifetime. So tonight I am honored that my colleagues are here in comedy and in music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love this job,\u201d he added. \u201cIt saved my life.\u201d\n\nOn the red carpet before his speech, Mr. Chappelle told The Hill that he believes \u201cpolitical correctness has its place\u201d and that he\u2019s sorry if his comedy has \u201churt anybody\u201d in the past.\n\n\u201cWe all want to live in a polite society, we just kind of have to work on the levels of coming to an agreement of what that actually looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cI, personally, am not afraid of other people\u2019s freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony airs on PBS on Jan. 7.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
