Mr Johnson's aide said if the Prime Minister were legally forced to seek a delay, voters would know who to blame - and it wasn't the Conservatives.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, hit back against the briefings: \u201cIt\u2019s parliament\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the opposition\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the Benn Act, it\u2019s Germany, it\u2019s Ireland - absolutely defining the character of this prime minister, a man who never takes responsibility for his own actions,\u201d he told MPs.\n\nPlaying the blame game ... British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Bloomberg\n\nThe Europeans were equally caustic. \u201cBoris Johnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\u201d tweeted European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nBrexiteers, meanwhile, immediately piled in on the other side. The Twitter account of Leave.EU, funded by multimillionaire and Nigel Farage associate Arron Banks, didn't hold back: \"We didn't win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut!\".\n\nThe last scrap of hope for a deal lies with Ireland, where Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's government is calling the EU's negotiating tune.\n\nEyes on the Irish\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they're prepared to compromise and accept elements of Mr Johnson's plan for two separate borders around Northern Ireland - one with Britain for customs, one with the EU for regulations - the Europeans would go along with it. Whether it can be made legally watertight by an EU summit on October 17-18 is another question.\n\nOn Wednesday morning (AEDT) the Irish were sounding emollient - though it was unclear whether this was genuine, or at attempt to side-step the attribution of fault.\n\n\"Certainly there are some in the UK who seem to be planning for a general election ahead of trying to plan to get a deal,\" said Ireland's deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney.\n\n\"Our focus not to get distracted with the blame game, because ultimately this is about finding a way of getting a deal.\"\n\nMr Coveney said Ireland's focus was on \"trying to close a gap between two negotiating teams ... that will allow the EU to support a way forward, and a way forward the UK can accept as well but that finds a way of avoiding the need to put border infrastructure near the border on the island of Ireland\".\n\n\"We know the impact that would have on politics on the island of Ireland, north and south, not just the impact on trade, and that\u2019s why we are so determined to avoid it.\n\n\"The focus has to be back where it needs to be, which is here in Brussels between two negotiating teams.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDomestic disquiet\n\nSome moderate Conservative cabinet ministers are said to be alarmed about the tough rhetoric coming from Mr Johnson's aides. Commentators are speculating that several ministers may yet resign, but Mr Johnson seems determined to crash through or crash out.\n\nMeanwhile, the government again prorogued parliament on Tuesday night (Wednesday AEDT), this time for five days - a more typical prorogation that is unlikely to attract controversy.\n\nThat paves the way for a Queen's speech on October 14, when the monarch attends Parliament and reads out the government's new legislative program.\n\nMr Johnson will use the speech to reiterate his non-Brexit battle lines for the election, which is expected before the year's end: a program of public largesse on police, hospitals and schools designed to win over socially conservative blue-collar voters.\n\nThe government also pressed on with no-deal Brexit preparations, releasing a \"Brexit readiness report\" that updated the tariff schedules and administrative requirements to be used if Britain crashes out on October 31.\n\nOne cross-bench peer, the barrister David Anderson, noted that if Brexit was a project to slough off unwanted regulation, right now it was having the opposite effect, at least for those with any traffic with the EU.\n\n\"Today\u2019s 'no-deal readiness report' illustrates on page after page how our hard-won freedoms and those of other Europeans are to be throttled by new red tape, 28 years after Thatcher\u2019s European Commissioner, Arthur Cockfield, achieved the Single Market on 1 Jan 1993 with the biggest bonfire of red tape in modern history,\" he said on Twitter.", "description": "The UK government downplays hopes of striking a Brexit deal, seemingly accepting a delay to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's October 31 deadline is inevitable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2922%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_9%2C$y_61/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ee94ebbe93276d3f051e6ce0f663a1c3798f9e04", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
