For years I have concealed from my best friend that her husband attempts to grope me when she is out of the room. The first time it happened, I was in the guest room and he entered late at night and tried to kiss me, which I rejected in shock.\n\nMy friend adores this man, she praises everything about him, his wit, his wisdom and his appearance, and seems completely happy with him. Her social media feed is full of smiling photos of the two of them sharing adventures.\n\nI don't see my friend very often, because she lives in a different part of the country. That's one of the reasons I haven't told her; stupidly I hoped it would stop happening. I also wondered if somehow I brought this on myself by being open and friendly. (Until this happened, I genuinely liked him.) As well, I was sure the revelation would either destroy her happiness, which I had no desire to do, or would turn her against me. Until this, I had no secrets from my friend.\n\nI go out of my way to avoid him whenever I see my friend, and suggest we do things on our own. Recently my friend told me I had changed, I was no longer the fun, loving person she remembered, and she was questioning our friendship. She asked what had happened to cause me to change. Is it time to tell the truth?\n\n\u2014 Anguished\n\nAnguished: Yes. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nEmbracing her while avoiding him was a valid and compassionate choice, but only if you were able to pull it off. You weren\u2019t. Not your fault. Blame your friend\u2019s acuity and the quality of your friendship. And, of course, the groper: They all made it impossible for you to distance yourself from the husband without also distancing yourself from her.\n\nSo, Plan B. You tell.\n\nTelling right away the first time would have been a valid and compassionate choice, too, by the way, especially if you had reason to believe it wasn\u2019t a one-time or isolated mistake.\n\nThat\u2019s because the validity and compassion lie in your intent. You kept the husband\u2019s secret not out of cruelty or self-preservation, but to stay out of your friend\u2019s marriage. That\u2019s fair.\n\nNow you\u2019d be telling not to punish the husband or protect yourself, but instead to let your friend know her husband\u2019s behavior is costing her in ways she may not realize. That\u2019s also fair.\n\nWhich brings us to another truth-telling you\u2019re due for: Neither you nor anyone else invites unwelcome sexual advances \u2014 or, if he succeeds in these groping attempts, sexual assaults \u2014 by being friendly; you weren\u2019t stupid to hope the husband would stop; you wouldn\u2019t destroy her happiness by telling your friend what happened; you wouldn\u2019t turn her against you.\n\nThe husband is responsible for the groping attempts.\n\nThe husband is responsible for not taking no for an answer.\n\nThe husband is responsible if the truth of his actions destroys his wife\u2019s happiness.\n\nThe husband is responsible if he falsely counter-accuses you. A real risk.\n\nThe husband is responsible if your friendship ends.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. It\u2019s not fair. But it is your responsibility now to fill in the blanks for your friend.", "description": "She has noticed a change in you.
