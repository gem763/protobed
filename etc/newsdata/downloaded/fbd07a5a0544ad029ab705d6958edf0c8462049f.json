Unfortunately, no less than three studies have recently shown that the efforts to ultimately eliminate gender discrimination and harassment are having negative effects for some women in the office as well. But there is another casualty here too, as the men who have failed to learn the lessons #MeToo have taught us.\n\nBack in April 2018 a majority of the respondents (55% men and 47% women) in a Pew Center Research survey of 6,251 adults said that the movement has \u201cmade it harder for men to know how to interact with women in the workplace\u201d and to \u201cnavigate workplace interactions\u201d. Sadly, only 28% thought that the movement will lead to more opportunities for women.\n\nEarlier this year, Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s organization LeanIn published the results of its study of 5,000 US adults, which examined the #MeToo movement\u2019s impact on the workplace, and the news wasn\u2019t encouraging either.\n\nThe survey found that 60% of male managers they asked were now \u201cuncomfortable doing common workplace activities with women such as mentoring, socializing or having one-on-one meetings\u201d, a sharp increase from the previous year. A perturbed Sandberg said that she spoke to \u201cmany\u201d male executives who said that they have been told not to put themselves in a position where they are alone with women, with many expressing an \u201cincreased level\u201d of awkwardness travelling, having dinner or even participating in one-on-one meetings with junior female colleagues.\n\nAnd now we have a new study due to be published by the University of Houston, also with discouraging results. The study found that men are now \u201csignificantly more reluctant\u201d to interact with their female employees. Among the findings, as reported by the Guardian\u2019s Arwa Mahdawi, are that 27% of men avoid one-on-one meetings with female co-workers, 21% of men said they would be reluctant to hire women for a job that would require close interaction (such as business travel) and 19% of men would be reluctant to hire an attractive woman.\n\nCiting the study\u2019s authors who conclude that \u201cmost men know what sexual harassment is, and most women know what it is\u201d, Mahdawi is clear about who\u2019s to blame. \u201cSo there you go: most men are perfectly aware of the difference between a friendly hug and a creepy hug,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey are perfectly aware of what constitutes harassment and what doesn\u2019t. Which makes you wonder why so many men are afraid to interact with women at work?\u201d\n\nAs a middle-aged man, business owner and manager, I must admit that Mahdawi is right.\n\nWe do know how to behave. We do know when to keep our mouths shut. We do know what\u2019s appropriate and inappropriate and the difference between a \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201ccreepy\u201d hug (I avoid hugs altogether). We have daughters, wives and significant others. We\u2019re quite aware of how we would like to see them treated. This is not rocket science. So when studies show that some men are \u201creluctant\u201d to have meetings or travel or interact with a \u201cjunior female colleague\u201d that is 100% the fault of the man.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing from these studies is another casualty of this behavior: the business owner or manager. That\u2019s the moron who doesn\u2019t hire or promote a talented employee just because a working relationship with her would require \u201cclose interaction\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019re that guy, then hindering a female employee\u2019s advancement out of fears of your own behavior is impeding the growth of your own company \u2013 and the welfare of your other employees. Get help. Your real concern should be that she\u2019ll just up and leave you to join a more accommodating and smarter competitor.", "description": "Hindering a female employee\u2019s advancement out of fears of your own behavior is impeding the growth of your organization", "authors": ["Gene Marks"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/260fdef778328943cb5f1aeefd4f3ae70dbbaca5/0_57_5438_3263/master/5438.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fd84cbfb140ce59bed15c779896a6b1a", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
