It suggests they fabricated events completely.\n\nLast weekend, NBC News reported that the Justice Department\u2019s probe into the origins of the Russia collusion investigation is now focusing on the CIA and the intelligence community. NBC News soft-peddled this significant development by giving former CIA Director John Brennan a platform (a pen?) to call the probe \u201cbizarre,\u201d and question \u201cthe legal basis for\u201d the investigation. Politico soon joined the spin effort, branding the investigation Attorney General William Barr assigned to Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham \u201cTrump\u2019s vengeance.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the media reports are true, and Barr and Durham have turned their focus to Brennan and the intelligence community, it is not a matter of vengeance; it is a matter of connecting the dots in congressional testimony and reports, leaks, and media spin, and facts exposed during the three years of panting about supposed Russia collusion. And it all started with Brennan.\n\nThat\u2019s not how the story went, of course. The company story ran that the FBI launched its Crossfire Hurricane surveillance of the Trump campaign on July 31, 2016, after learning that a young Trump advisor, George Papadopoulos, had bragged to an Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer, that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton. This tip from Downer, when coupled with WikiLeaks\u2019s release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails and evidence of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, supposedly triggered the FBI\u2019s decision to target the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Real Story Is Different\n\nBut as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller report made clear, it wasn\u2019t merely Papadopoulos\u2019 bar-room boast at issue: It was \u201ca series of contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government,\u201d that the DOJ and FBI, and later the Special Counsel\u2019s office investigated.\n\nAnd who put the FBI on to those supposedly suspicious contacts? Former CIA Director John Brennan.\n\n\u201cI encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about,\u201d Brennan told the House Intelligence Committee back in 2017. Whether or not there was collusion with Russia, Brennan didn\u2019t profess to know, but he passed on the information to the FBI to reach a conclusion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not CIA\u2019s job to make a determination about whether a U.S. person is cooperating, colluding, or whatever in some type of criminal or legal matter,\u201d Brennan explained, stressing that instead, \u201cit is our responsibility to give the Bureau everything that they need in order to follow that path and make such a determination and recommendation if they want to press charges.\u201d\n\nThe evidence suggests, however, that Brennan\u2019s CIA and the intelligence community did much more than merely pass on details about \u201ccontacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign\u201d to the FBI. The evidence suggests that the CIA and intelligence community\u2014including potentially the intelligence communities of the UK, Italy, and Australia\u2014created the contacts and interactions that they then reported to the FBI as suspicious.\n\nCreating a Russia Collusion Narrative\n\nStefan Halper features prominently in the plot. All-but-officially outed by the government as a CIA source, the aging academic had contact with at least four members of the Trump campaign. Halper\u2019s job of connecting targets with Russians, however, dates back to January 2014, when he worked at Cambridge University alongside Sir Richard Dearlove, the former director of the British intelligence service MI6, and Christopher Andrew, the official historian for the British counterintelligence group MI5.\n\nIn January 2014, according to a lawsuit filed against Halper for defamation by the Russian-born Svetlana Lokhova, Dearlove and Andrew invited her to attend a group dinner with U.S. Gen. Michael Flynn. At the time, Flynn served as Barack Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence.\n\nThe dinner went forward as planned on February 28, 2014, with Halper, Dearlove, and Andrew all in attendance, alongside Flynn and Lokhova and several others from the Cambridge community. After dinner, according to Lokhova\u2019s complaint, \u201cAndrew invited Lokhova to address General Flynn,\u201d and they had a brief public exchange about her academic research on Russia. Then, as laid out in her lawsuit, after \u201cGeneral Flynn informally became an advisor to the Trump presidential campaign, . . . Halper came back into the picture,\u201d with Andrew inviting Lokhova and Halper to join him for dinner at his house.\n\nWhile the 2014 dinner went unnoticed at the time and seemed of no concern to the Obama administration, after the Russia collusion narrative gained steam, the media reported that \u201cUS intelligence officials had serious concerns about Michael Flynn\u2019s appointment as the White House national security adviser because of his history of contacts with Moscow and his encounter with a woman who had trusted access to Russian spy agency records.\u201d Other outlets made clear the then-unidentified woman was Lokhova.\n\nSo, had Halper and his British intelligence counterparts arranged Flynn\u2019s incidental meeting with the Russian-born Lokhova and then reported that contact to the FBI to later justify spying on Flynn?\n\nHalper Sure Gets Around\n\nHalper also crossed paths with Trump campaign advisor Carter Page at a symposium held in Cambridge in mid-July of 2016, shortly after Page spoke at the New Economic School in Moscow. Page \u201csaid he did not detect anything untoward from Halper,\u201d although the former Trump campaign advisor also \u201cnoted that in their first conversation at Cambridge, Halper said he was longtime friends with then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Halper raised Russia as a topic of conversation, Page told me that his \u201cinteractions with Halper from the very beginning originated and was based upon our mutual interest as foreign policy scholars.\u201d Page added that \u201cthe specifics of those conversations are a long forgotten memory,\u201d given that at the time, some three years ago, they were but \u201cinnocuous interactions with this professor.\u201d But \u201cit seems unlikely I wouldn\u2019t have discussed such generalized topics related to Russia with him.\u201d After all, Page stressed, he had lived and worked in both London and Russia, and for much of the past century the Washington-Moscow relationship had been central to foreign policy.\n\nSo, had Halper chatted up Page to prompt the Trump aide to speak of Russia and his Russian connections? And did Halper then relay those connections to the CIA, which then fed them to the FBI?\n\nAfter the FBI launched its investigation into the Trump campaign at the end of July 2016, Halper reached out to Sam Clovis, Trump\u2019s national co-chairman. Clovis, who met with Halper in the D.C. area, similarly described their conversation as innocuous, and focused \u201cmostly on foreign policy issues, including China.\u201d\n\nWhile Clovis didn\u2019t mention any talk of Russia, the same cannot be said about Halper\u2019s outreach to Trump advisor Papadopoulos. In September 2016, Halper and a woman posing as Halper\u2019s research assistant, \u201cAzra Turk,\u201d met with Papadopoulos in a London bar, asking him directly whether the Trump campaign was working with Russia, which Papadopoulos denied.\n\nEarlier this year, The New York Times reported that the FBI had directed Halper and Turk to contact Papadopoulos, while the Russia-conspiracy mainstay instead portrayed the Page contact as coincidental. But was it? And what about the Flynn set-up at Cambridge? Were those instead additional efforts to create connections and conversations about Russia to justify the FBI launching an investigation into the Trump campaign?\n\nSame Pattern, Different Agents\n\nThen there\u2019s Joseph Mifsud, who arranged for Papadopoulos to connect with myriad real and fake Russians, with his cover as a Russian-connected academic serving as the supposed impetus to launch Crossfire Hurricane. While we do not yet know who ran the Mifsud operation, given that Barr and Durham returned to the United States with two Blackberry devices used by mystery man rules out the possibility that he served as a Russian or otherwise hostile agent: No foreign adversary would allow his smartphones to be appropriated by the enemy.\n\nMifsud\u2019s presence at the Russia Today dinner gala at which Flynn was seated next to Putin adds to the questions concerning Mifsud, his handlers, and his role. Was Mifsud responsible for creating or highlighting connections between Trump campaign members? Did Mifsud then share this invented \u201cintel\u201d with the CIA, which then fed it to the FBI?\n\nFelix Sater is another suspicious character. Back in 1998, none other than Andrew Weissmann\u2014more recently known as Mueller\u2019s pitbull and No. 2 in the special counsel investigation\u2014approved a cooperation agreement with Sater that kept the felon out of prison. From publicly available information, as late as 2005, Sater continued to cooperate with the FBI. And reports indicate Sater continued as an FBI and CIA asset much longer.\n\nSo, was Sater working for the FBI or CIA when he pushed his connections to Putin to Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen? Did Sater relay those exchanges to the CIA to construct more suspicious connections with Russia?\n\nAnd what about the infamous Trump Tower meeting? Had that been arranged to create yet another connection between the Trump campaign and Russians?\n\nThese are the questions Barr and Durham should be asking themselves to arrive at the bottom line: Were the Russia connections contrived by the CIA, and was Brennan the plotter-in-chief hoping to prevent a President Trump\u2014or to destroy him later?", "description": "The evidence suggests John Brennan\u2019s CIA and the intelligence community did much more than merely pass on details to the FBI.", "authors": ["Margot Cleveland"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1024px-John_Brennan_47244496811.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
