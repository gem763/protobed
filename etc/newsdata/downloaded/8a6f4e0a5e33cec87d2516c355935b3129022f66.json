Now we do not intend to suggest that there is coordination at play in all of this. That would be journalistically wrong. So instead we will do something the press avoids doing \u2014 we will show evidence.\n\nWe will open with one of our esteemed politicians.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh should never have been confirmed to the Supreme Court. It was plain to me and many others at the time that the FBI \u2018investigation\u2019 into the serious, corroborated allegations of sexual assault by Justice Kavanaugh was a sham. \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) September 15, 2019\n\nDid you catch her using quotes to call into question the work of the FBI? (We\u2019ll revisit that in just a bit.) Pretty bad to be sure, but it seems that last word is something that more than anonymous randos are tossing around this day. There appears a rather common thread among this nation\u2019s thought leaders.\n\nKlobuchar rips \"sham\" investigation into Kavanaugh after latest allegations of sexual assault https://t.co/ICQyPaXMHL pic.twitter.com/9vTHMV9ZSc \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) September 15, 2019\n\nThe investigation was an obvious sham at the time. Grassley\u2019s lead investigator on the Judiciary Committee was Mike Davis who tweeted that he was \u201cunfazed\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d to \u201cconfirm Judge Kavanaugh\u201d \u2013 in the midst of the investigation, when he was interviewing witnesses. pic.twitter.com/FkS5E7yBAA \u2014 Adam Jentleson \ud83c\udf88\ud83d\udc22 (@AJentleson) September 15, 2019\n\nI wrote this last October for @HuffPost \u201cSo now we\u2019ve gone from a sham hearing to a sham investigation where the White House is dictating to the FBI whom they can interview and whom they can\u2019t.\u201d https://t.co/roYUPI1NF6 #KavanaughLied \u2014 Kurt Bardella (@kurtbardella) September 15, 2019\n\nVote out the Republicans who voted for Kavanaugh. Remember the \"investigation\" was a sham, totally rushed, limited in scope. Kavanaugh's behavior during the hearing (his response to Klobuchar, his lies, his promise of retribution) was enough to disqualify him. #KavanaughLied \u2014 Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) September 15, 2019\n\nThis story contains damning reporting that Justice Kavanaugh should be made to address \u2014 and demonstrates what an abject sham the FBI \"Investigation\" of the claims against him was in the fall of 2018. https://t.co/pJveokwPbE \u2014 John Heilemann (@jheil) September 15, 2019\n\nRemember that time the White House tweeted the FBI's report on Kavanaugh at 2:30am on the day of his confirmation\u2026 If this process wasn't a complete sham, I don't know what is.https://t.co/Q7ddKuk0w4 \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) September 15, 2019\n\nI sincerely wish that my piece on the quid pro quo between the Trump Administration and the Federalist Society would eventually be proven wrong. The FBI investigation into Kavanaugh was a sham, as I predicted a year ago. We The People are losing America.https://t.co/wHYflq1dbD \u2014 \ud835\ude70\ud835\ude7c\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude7d \ud835\ude73\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude7d\ud835\ude83 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@keith_pochick) September 15, 2019\n\nThe FBI investigation into him was a sham. It was not a comprehensive investigation. They totally ignored testaments from fellow classmates and didn't interview both accused and accuser. \u2014 Jack Wallen (@jlwallen) September 15, 2019\n\nAt the time of c#Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, many of us said that the FBI investigation was a sham limited by Senate Republicans. Now we know that for a fact. \u201cMs. Ramirez\u2019s legal team gave the F.B.I. a list of at least 25 individuals who may have had corroborating evidence.(1/2) https://t.co/UjHA9Jku9B \u2014 Mimi Rocah (@Mimirocah1) September 15, 2019\n\nThe FBI DID NOT interview the 25 witnesses she gave them names for. Sham investigation. \u2014 Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) September 15, 2019\n\nThis seems serious! Repeating lies from one year ago does not make them more true. Nor does everyone on the same page repeating the same phrase, but this is the Left, after all.\n\nBut all of these influential minds dumping on the FBI calls back to another reality we all lived through not so long ago. Recall when these same minds used to say that it was a moral outrage when the President dared to question the integrity of the FBI?\n\nThere is no institution that Donald Trump's minions won't attack to protect their lying President. Going after the FBI to protect the President is reckless and unconscionable. pic.twitter.com/mlynjHFpj9 \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) January 25, 2018\n\nBut going after the FBI because you do not like a judge is acceptable?!?! We need clarification on where that line of when it is/is not acceptable rests, Senator.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough Trump rejects the conclusions of the CIA, FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia\u2026 https://t.co/DE0JIqTbnc \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) December 24, 2016\n\nBad when Trump questions the FBI, but acceptable for you, correct Robert??\n\nAh well, if it were not for double-standards, and all\u2026", "description": "Amid all of the outrage over Brett Kavanaugh today see if you notice a theme -- and how it contradicts the OTHER theme from leftists.", "authors": ["Brad S.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/really-snl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
