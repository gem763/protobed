Obscure QBs and backups", "language": "en", "text": "Who are these guys?\n\nAlready, eight NFL teams are starting quarterbacks they didn\u2019t plan to have behind center about a month ago. That\u2019s one-quarter of the league.\n\nIncluded are two of the more obscure names: the Jets\u2019 Luke Falk in for Sam Darnold (mononucleosis), and the Panthers\u2019 Kyle Allen, starting Sunday for Cam Newton (foot). Falk actually is New York\u2019s third-stringer; Trevor Siemian damaged his ankle in last Monday night\u2019s loss to Cleveland.\n\nNew York\u2019s other team, the Giants, made the switch this week to sixth overall draft pick Daniel Jones, benching longtime starter Eli Manning.\n\nTwo of the league\u2019s biggest stars, Drew Brees (thumb surgery) of New Orleans and Ben Roethlisberger (elbow surgery) of Pittsburgh, are sidelined. Teddy Bridgewater takes over for the Saints and Mason Rudolph gets the assignment for the Steelers.\n\nMiami has switched from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Josh Rosen, and, of course, Andrew Luck retired and Jacoby Brissett is the man in Indianapolis.\n\nGardner Minshew started for Jacksonville in a Thursday night win over Tennessee; Nick Foles is hurt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Who are these guys?", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
