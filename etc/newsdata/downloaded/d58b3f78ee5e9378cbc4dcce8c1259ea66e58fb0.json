Two finishes. Thus far in his pro career, Conor Dixon has beaten both opponents placed in his path.\n\nAt Bellator 231 on Friday night, Dixon (2-0 MMA, 2-0 BMMA) defeated promotional newcomer Orkhan Ismatzade (0-1 MMA, 0-1 BMMA). The fight came to an end when Dixon locked a kimura and secured the tap 42 seconds into the opening round.\n\nWhile he was pleased with performance at Mohegan Sun Arena, Dixon is already looking for his next opponent. If he has his way, his future will link back to his past. Dixon wants to fight Dillon Danis, who he alleges turned down a Bellator 232 matchup against him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to keep putting guys in front of me and I\u2019m going to keep submitting them,\u201d Dixon told MMA Junkie after the fight. \u201cI\u2019m looking for big fish now. They offered me Dillon Danis for tomorrow a few months back, but he turned me down. I don\u2019t know if he can deny me for much longer.\u201d\n\nA lot of fighters have voiced their disdain for Danis since he entered the MMA scene. However, Dixon\u2019s issue is what he perceives to be Danis\u2019 unwillingness to commit to difficult fights.\n\n\u201cHe keeps trying to box Disney boxers,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what his endgame is. If you put Dillon Danis in front of me, I will pummel him for three rounds straight or I will tap him out. He cannot run from me.\u201d\n\nBellator\u2019s welterweight division has a number of highly touted grapplers, including former Penn State wrestler Ed Ruth, BJJ wizard A.J. Agazarm, and the aforementioned Danis. After his second pro bout, Dixon believes his name should be a top the list.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to prove I\u2019m the best grappler in the division,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIf you put Ed Ruth in front of me, I\u2019m going to submit him. You put A.J. Agazarm, I\u2019ll cut down to 155, I\u2019ll submit him. It does not matter. I\u2019m here to prove I\u2019m the best grappler in the 155-pound division (or) the170-pound division. It doesn\u2019t matter. Put him in front of me, I\u2019ll keep knocking them down.\u201d\n\nWhere does Dixon\u2019s confidence come from? The same place his physical abilities originate from, indicated Dixon. A member of three renowned Pennsylvania-based gyms, Dixon credited his training partners and coaches for his mold.\n\n\u201cI train at Renzo Gracie Philly and Webb\u2019s,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing jiu-jitsu my whole life with my dad at Impact and we\u2019ve got straight killers. Sean Brady, Paul Felder, Jeremiah Wells. The list goes on and on and on.\n\n\u201cI train with straight killers on a daily basis, so I knew I was coming in here prepared for anything this guys was going to throw at me. I felt good. I felt really good. Again, I can cut down to 155. I feel good about any matchup. Any matchup in these 155 or 170-pound divisions. It\u2019s not a plan to fast-track me. I\u2019m ready for it. I really truly believe it.\u201d", "description": "At Bellator 231 on Friday night, Connor Dixon defeated promotional newcomer Orkhan Ismatzade in 42 seconds.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/connor-dixon-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
