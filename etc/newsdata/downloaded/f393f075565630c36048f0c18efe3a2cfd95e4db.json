How do you replace some hugely loved household names?'\n\nWe studied the ITV output from 6am to midnight last Tuesday, one of the few days whose schedules were not disrupted by the Rugby World Cup.\n\n6am: Good Morning Britain hosted by Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid\n\n8.30am: Lorraine hosted by Lorraine Kelly followed by Judge Rinder hosted by Robert Rinder at 9.25am\n\nThe day was dominated by white presenters from Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain to The Jonathan Ross Show at 11.10pm.\n\nOut of 18 hours of output, just 24 minutes were presented by a non-white broadcaster.\n\nNina Hossain, whose father is from Bangladesh, fronted the 1.30pm news bulletin made by ITN, which has run a successful diversity initiative for several years.\n\nOther days scored better for diversity.\n\n10.30am: This Morning hosted by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield\n\n12.30pm: Loose Women hosted by Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Janet Street-Porter and Gloria Hunniford\n\n2pm: Dickinson's Real Deal hosted by David Dickinson and Tenable hosted by Warwick Davis at 3pm\n\nMonday featured businesswoman Saira Khan on Loose Women and Sir Trevor McDonald presenting To Catch a Serial Killer, while on Friday, Ranvir Singh hosted the early-evening news while Ms Hossain fronted News At Ten.\n\nITV also suffers from a lack of diversity away from the studio.\n\nThe ten members of its senior management team are all white, and there is only one non-white person out of 11 on its board of directors, Salman Amin.\n\n4pm: Tipping Point hosted by Ben Shephard and The Chase hosted by Bradley Walsh at 5pm\n\n6.30pm: News with Mary Nightingale followed by Love Your Garden hosted by Alan Titchmarsh at 8pm\n\nLast month regulator Ofcom said ITV was behind the rest of the industry in promoting people from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Yesterday Ofcom said: 'It's vital that all broadcasters reflect the true diversity of the UK.'\n\nITV said last night: 'Our aim is for our programmes to reflect the diversity of our audiences. Our overall on-screen BAME representation exceeds the population level with a range of established, well-known and emerging BAME figures across our shows.\n\n'We recognise there is more to do and are fully committed to continuing to improve, having published new targets for increasing diversity over the next three years.'\n\n9pm: Joanna Lumley's Japan\n\n10pm: News with Tom Bradby followed by Heathrow: Britain's Busiest Airport narrated by Julie Walters at 10.45pm", "description": "Nina Hossain, the lunchtime news anchor, was the only ethic minority presenter on the network.
