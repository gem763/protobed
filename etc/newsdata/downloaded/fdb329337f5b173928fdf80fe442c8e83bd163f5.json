The company has been indicted on 13 criminal counts. Then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Huawei has been trying to steal American technology and lied about its relationship with its Iranian subsidiary.\n\nFriday marks the three-month anniversary of Meng's arrest, and Canada had until midnight to decide whether the extradition hearing should proceed, the CBC reports.\n\nMeng is the daughter of Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei. Ren denied in January that his company spies for China.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Canada said in a statement that China is \"utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes\" Canada's decision, calling it \"a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise.\"\n\nMeng's lawyers said she maintains her innocence and called the extradition request an abuse of the processes of law, Reuters reports.\n\nThe British Columbia Supreme Court has scheduled an appearance date for March 6.\n\n\"During the extradition hearing, the Crown will make its detailed arguments in its submissions to the Court, where evidence will be filed and become part of the public record,\" Canada said in the statement. \"An extradition hearing is not a trial nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence. If a person is ultimately extradited from Canada to face prosecution in another country, the individual will have a trial in that country.\"\n\nMeng remains on bail, with certain conditions, as the judicial process continues.", "description": "The U.S. has sought Meng's extradition since she was detained in December.
