I believe it takes courage to build peace and that is why it is important for the United States, Iran and the signatories of the agreement to show this courage.\u201d\n\nBut Jubeir set out a series of tough conditions for renegotiating the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, including fresh restrictions on its nuclear programme after 2025, a 24/7 inspection regime all over the country and restrictions on its ballistic missile programme.\n\nThe demand, he said was \u201cno nukes, no missiles and no terrorism\u201d, adding: \u201cThe Europeans were coming round to this being the objective. We believe appeasement does not work with Iran.\n\n\u201cWe believe that when Europeans did not take a strong position after the attacks on the pipelines and oilfield in Shaybah [in August], this emboldened and encouraged Iran.\u201d\n\nAlthough Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais facilities, Riyadh, Washington and the EU have laid the blame on Iran.\n\nThe US said it had expected Monday\u2019s statement by the UK, France and Germany, stating that Iran was behind the attack, because European and US investigators are examining weapons fragments together in Saudi Arabia.\n\nRelated: How did oil attack breach Saudi defences and what will happen next?\n\n\u201cI really appreciate that our allies \u2026 have come forward and recognised publicly the truth,\u201d the US assistant secretary of state for the near east, David Schenker, told journalists.\n\n\u201cThis did not come as a major surprise. The Brits and the French are on the ground with us, with the Saudis and the UN part of the investigative team in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Schenker said.\n\n\u201cWe have been transparent in terms of chain of custody \u2026 of all the equipment that we now have from the attack. And we\u2019re exploiting it together.\n\n\u201cEven before we have finished this investigation, the evidence that is emerging is incontrovertible.\u201d\n\nThe US has been insistent that it would not carry out a retaliatory strike, but would beef up Saudi defences and increase other forms of pressure on Iran.\n\nTrump on Tuesday called on other nations to join the US in pressuring Iran after the attacks, but said there was still a path to peace.", "description": "Saudi minister says military response to attack on oil facilities still being considered \u2018There comes a point when even America\u2019s patience runs out,\u2019 said Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi foreign affairs minister.
