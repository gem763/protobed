(The operation) wasn't improvised, there was planning, but... it takes time to obtain an arrest warrant. When the operation was already under way, they decided to improvise and attempt to\" get a warrant and arrest Guzman, he said.\n\nHe added that Guzman was never \"formally detained\".\n\nHeavily armed cartel gunmen surrounded the house where Guzman was being held on Thursday afternoon and launched a massive assault on various parts of the western city of 750 000 people, sending terrified residents fleeing for safety.\n\nLopez Obrador, who faced a firestorm of criticism over the episode, defended the decision to free Guzman.\n\n\"I support the decisions that were made. The situation turned very difficult and many citizens' lives were at risk, many human beings,\" he told a separate news conference.\n\n\"Catching a criminal can't be worth more than people's lives,\" added the leftist leader.\n\n\"This decision was made to protect the people. You can't fight fire with fire.\"", "description": "Mexico's defence minister has confirmed that authorities released a son of drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman after his arrest triggered an all-out gun battle on the streets of Culiacan, capital of their cartel's bastion, Sinaloa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7942/0ae73a0f134c4e5699a6e42e1f8500b0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
