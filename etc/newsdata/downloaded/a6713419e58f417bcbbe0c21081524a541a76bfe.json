But unlike a typical politician who cares about appearances and optics, he not only didn\u2019t mind, he welcomed the firestorm.\n\nAn outside Trump adviser said the president, facing a barrage of criticism from all directions on everything from removing troops in Syria to his call to the leader of Ukraine, has become \u201cfearless\u201d because he has seen over and over again that he won\u2019t lose the backing of supporters no matter what seemingly outrageous action he takes.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the noise the media and the left make,\u201d the person said. \u201cHe has demonstrated he\u2019s bulletproof.\u201d\n\nIt was Trump, himself, who suggested to his staff that they consider holding the summit at Doral when they began considering sites, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said. After considering 12 locations, Doral was chosen.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) described it as \u201camong the most brazen examples yet of the president\u2019s corruption.\u201c\n\nMulvaney, who is under fire for allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Trump's potential 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, announced Trump's decision at an unusual White House briefing that appeared designed to win the president\u2019s praise.\n\nThe summit will take place next June 10-12, in the middle of his 2020 reelection campaign, just as Democrats pick a nominee to run against him.\n\nMulvaney said Trump would put on the event at cost and would not personally profit from the choice of venue \u201cin any way, shape or form.\u201c He also dismissed questions about the president winning longer-term benefits from boosting the Trump corporate brand.\n\n\u201cI would simply ask you all to consider the possibility that Donald Trump\u2018s brand is probably strong enough as it is, and he doesn\u2018t need any more help on that,\u201c he said. \u201cIt\u2018s the most recognizable name in the English language and probably around the world right now.\u201c\n\nLast month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened an impeachment inquiry that includes whether Trump is illegally making money off his presidency.\n\nThe emoluments clause of the Constitution forbids a president from profiting from foreign governments or receiving any money from the U.S. government except his or her annual salary.\n\nOn Thursday, Republican lawmakers showed little interest in the allegations of wrongdoing from the G-7 decision.\n\n\u201cI will keep my comments to myself. I\u2019m just not gonna comment on the president for a while. I\u2019ve done enough for a while,\u201d said Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), who recently announced he was no longer supporting Trump after he withdrew troops from Syria.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), whose district includes Doral, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the news and expressed no concern over the summit being held at a Trump resort. \u201cThat\u2019s my district. It\u2019s a great, diverse community. It\u2019s going to be great for the local economy. I\u2019m thrilled.\u201d\n\nTrump has faced criticism outside the GOP for not fully separating himself from his eponymous company after he was sworn into office. The president still owns his business but has placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit. He can receive money from the trust at any time without the public\u2019s knowledge.\n\nTrump previously mentioned Doral as a potential location for the annual summit during the most recent G-7 meeting in August, when foreign leaders convened in Biarritz, France. Democratic lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee urged Trump days later against choosing the Doral resort as the G-7 host site, warning that it would represent a potential violation of both the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses in the Constitution.\n\nThe Oversight and Judiciary committees have already demanded the administration and Trump\u2019s company for details about the president suggesting the summit be held at one of his resorts.\n\nTrump frequently visits his properties \u2014 primarily in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 and has traveled to them more than 300 times since he was sworn into office, according to a compilation of information released by the White House. In 2017, he and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top presidential adviser, even made a brief unannounced stop at the Trump International Hotel in Honolulu to thank employees for their work.\n\nTrump already faces lawsuits alleging he violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign officials at his resorts and hotels. His company donated nearly $200,000 to the U.S. Treasury in February that it said came from profits from foreign governments, but watchdog groups say the amount should be higher.\n\n\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201c said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is involved with one of the lawsuits. \u201cGiven the potential consequences the president is facing for abusing the presidency for his own gain, we would have thought he would steer clear of blatant corruption at least temporarily; instead he has doubled down on it.\u201c\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied that he is using the presidency to promote his resorts. \u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place, and people, they use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d he told reporters last month.\n\nRevenue increased at many of the resorts Trump visited in 2018, according to Trump\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure forms. But Doral's net operating income fell by 69 percent over the past two years. That comes even as Trump\u2019s overall income dipped slightly from $450 million in 2017 to $434 million in 2018.\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/60/6d/59be9a994e539f63f8a772c80b7d/191017-doral-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
