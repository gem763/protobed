It will be replaced with four smaller and more modern jails located closer to the city\u2019s main courthouses in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.\n\n\u201cRikers Island is a symbol of brutality and inhumanity and it is time for us to once and for all close Rikers Island,\u201d said the city council speaker Corey Johnson, a Democrat who shepherded the plan through the council. \u201cAs a city we must do everything we can to move away from the failed policies of mass incarceration.\u201d\n\nThe New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, and other Democrats support the plan, which has a price tag of more than $8bn.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those moments where a cycle gets broken. There\u2019s been a cycle of incarceration,\u201d de Blasio said at a news conference after the vote. \u201cThat cycle ends now\u201d he added.\n\nThe Rikers complex counts 10 jails on an island between Queens and the Bronx that mainly houses inmates awaiting trial. The complex has housed jail inmates since the 1930s and has long been known for brutality. It saw hundreds of stabbings each year during the 1980s and early 1990s. It has been nicknamed Gladiator School, Torture Island, the Guant\u00e1namo of New York and, in summertime, the Oven.\n\nRelated: 'Belly of the beast': former inmates hail New York plan to close Rikers Island jail\n\nMore recently, a 2014 Associated Press investigation detailed dozens of inmate deaths including that of a homeless ex-marine who essentially baked to death in a hot cell.\n\nDaniel Dromm, a councilman, invoked the names of former inmates who have died at the facility, including Kalief Browder. The most notorious case in the jail\u2019s recent history involved the 16-year-old Browder, who spent three years at Rikers Island after being accused of stealing a small backpack. The charge was eventually dismissed. Browder was beaten by officers and inmates, as shown in disturbing footage from surveillance cameras, obtained by the New Yorker. He took his own life at age 22.\n\nDromm also recalled Layleen Polanco, a transgender woman who was found dead in her cell last June.\n\nWith falling crime rates, the number of people incarcerated in the city on a daily basis has declined from a high of nearly 22,000 in 1991 to about 7,000 today. City officials announced this week that they believe they can shrink the jail population even further by 2026, to just 3,300 prisoners.\n\nBackers of the jail overhaul say they expect the city\u2019s jail population will keep dropping because of criminal justice reforms.\n\nSome critics of the plan say fewer cells may mean more violent criminals on city streets. Others say building new jails will inevitably lead to incarceration. Anti-jail activists chanted during the vote: \u201cIf you build it they will fill it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea is to begin actually decarcerating New York City instead of building new jails\u201d said Marlene Nava Ramos, a member of the advocacy group No New Jails NYC.", "description": "Rikers is scheduled to shutter by 2026 after a decades long run as one of the world\u2019s largest jails   The Rikers complex counts 10 jails on an island between Queens and the Bronx that mainly houses inmates awaiting trial.
