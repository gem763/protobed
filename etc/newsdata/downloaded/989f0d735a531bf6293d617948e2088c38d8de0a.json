It can change the way we connect.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition is sure to gain the attention of Congress, especially after members met last week with Zuckerberg to share their concerns over Facebook\u2019s marketing muscle and data-privacy practices.\n\nThe social-networking giant has been working on a \u201cdirect brain interface\u201d for several years. A creation of its secretive Building 8 division, it could take tech-enhanced communication to the next level -- literally inside someone\u2019s thought process. One goal of the project, described to this reporter at the F8 developer\u2019s conference in San Jose, Calif., in 2017, included technology that would let people type 100 words per minute with their brain. \u201cWhat if you could type directly from your brain... with the speed and flexibility of voice and the privacy of text?\u201d then-Building 8 head Regina Dugan said in an interview.\n\nNew York-based CTRL-Labs will become part of the Facebook Reality Labs division, which is designing a hands-free pair of augmented reality glasses. The company has raised tens of millions of dollars, including $28 million from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -1.33% GOOG, -1.24% GV and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, -2.45% Alexa Fund earlier this year.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work: You have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button,\u201d Bosworth wrote. \u201cThe wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life. It captures your intention so you can share a photo with a friend using an imperceptible movement or just by, well, intending to.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s futuristic endeavor is one of several tech projects to explore the human brain. Tesla Inc. TSLA, -7.47% CEO Elon Musk, for example, founded Neuralink Corp., a privately-held Silicon Valley company that would merge computers with brains to keep up with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe timing of Facebook\u2019s endeavor, which sent chills throughout the F8 crowd two years ago because of its possible ramifications, is likely to evoke the same reaction from federal and state lawmakers as well as privacy advocates who already are concerned about the company\u2019s economic and cultural influence as it collects mountains of data from billions of its faithful users.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook\u2019s business practices, along with those of Amazon. The Justice Department is doing the same with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.48% and Google. All four companies have shown a keen interest in the financial potential of mixed reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nHouse lawmakers have asked more than 80 companies how the businesses practices of the aforementioned quartet has harmed them, according to a report in the New York Times. One of those companies is likely to be Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.47% , whose legal team for years has kept a dossier of ways it believes Facebook has attempted to undercut its business, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.", "description": "Facebook Inc. said late Monday it agreed to buy a startup that would let people control computers with their brains \u2013 a long-stated goal by Chief Executive...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR907_Facebo_ZG_20190923195525.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
