Join the conversation below.\n\nSupporters of the new laws argue they empower law-abiding citizens who carry firearms legally and ensure they are not defenseless when violence breaks out. The backers also said these changes protect their constitutional right to bear arms.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to disarm the good guys and leave law-abiding citizens defenseless where violent offenders break the law to do great harm,\u201d said Texas state Sen. Donna Campbell, a Republican, said earlier this year.\n\nGun-control groups have criticized these laws, arguing that instead of protecting public safety, they put more people in danger.\n\n\u201cThe Texas governor and the legislature have allowed gun lobbyists to write these gun laws,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.\n\nThe rampage in Odessa and nearby Midland in West Texas on Saturday afternoon left seven dead and injured 22 others. On Aug. 3, a gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart store in El Paso.\n\nTexas already had some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. But the new laws state that school districts cannot prohibit licensed gun owners from storing a firearm in a vehicle in a school parking lot and weaken restrictions on how many armed school marshals a school district may appoint.\n\nAnother new law bans landlords from prohibiting residents from possessing firearms or ammunition on the property\u2014and that places of worship are to be treated the same as other private property when determining whether a licensed holder may carry firearms on the premises.\n\nThe new laws also allow residents to carry handguns without a license in public for a week after a state or natural disaster is declared. The goal, according to lawmakers: to deter looting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about license holders being able to protect ourselves if some madman comes in and starts shooting up the place, like in Odessa. You have the right to defend yourself,\u201d said Michael Cargill, a longtime Austin, Texas, gun advocate.\n\nHe dismissed arguments that the recent shootings and the loosened laws mean Texas is heading the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about mental health issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThis person was at this point long before he got here\u2026 You can\u2019t pick on the tool. We need to focus on the root cause of the problem.\u201d\n\nGun-control groups pointed to polling indicating the public generally supports legislation that prioritizes gun safety and tougher background checks on gun sales. They criticized pro-gun groups and some lawmakers who have thwarted efforts to enact stricter background checks and, they argue, have otherwise done little to address gun violence.\n\n\u201cThoughts and prayers have done nothing to stop the epidemic of gun violence. Yes this is f\u2014ed up; and if we don\u2019t call it out for what it is, we will continue to have this bloodshed in America,\u201d said Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman on Twitter.\n\nDuring a news conference Sunday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said \u201cthere is no issue we will not look at\u201d when asked whether Texas should ban AR-style rifles. But he also emphasized that some mass shootings in the state haven't involved those types of weapons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to understand that the shooting that took place in Santa Fe High School did not,\u201d he said, referring to a 2018 shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, that left 10 people dead. \u201cThe largest mass shooting we\u2019ve had in the state of Texas happened at Luby\u2019s in Central Texas and involved only handguns,\u201d he added, citing a 1991 rampage in Killeen, Texas, which left 23 people dead.\n\nWrite to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "description": "A series of laws easing gun regulation in Texas that were passed earlier this year took effect on Sunday as the second-largest state in the U.S. was responding to a second shooting rampage in a month.", "authors": ["Esther Fung", "Elizabeth Findell"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103216/social"}
