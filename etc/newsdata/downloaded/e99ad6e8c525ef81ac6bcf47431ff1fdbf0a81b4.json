He also pushed back against Farrow\u2019s claim that the network withheld his investigative work on Harvey Weinstein under threat that Weinstein would find a way to go public with the Lauer story.\n\n\u201cOne thing is indisputable,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cRonan Farrow walked out of NBC News while working on the Weinstein story and, within two months, published an incredible article at The New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day.\u201d\n\nHayes said that \u201cthe insidious destructive force of the path of least resistance is everywhere you look. Heck, I feel the tug of it myself as my own news organization is embroiled in a very public controversy over its conduct.\u201d\n\nAn NBC News spokesperson declined comment.\n\nWATCH: Chris Hayes on the new Ronan Farrow book. https://t.co/YBrlGUSsYd #inners \u2014 All In with Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
