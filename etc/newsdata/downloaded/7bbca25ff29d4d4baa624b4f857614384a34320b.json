And finally he\u2019d had enough: When the protesters began shouting the names of children who\u2019d died in federal immigration custody, McAleenan walked off the stage.\n\nThe acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who is reportedly becoming increasingly isolated within the Trump administration, was slated to give the opening speech at the Migration Policy Institute and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network\u2019s annual immigration conference at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut protesters seated in the audience repeatedly thwarted him, standing up and holding banners that said \u201cHate is not normal\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhen immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back! When children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\u201d\n\nMcAleenan, the former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, became acting DHS secretary in April 2019 after his predecessor, Kirstjen Nielsen, was pushed out. As CBP commissioner, he helped implement the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. But now, several sources recently told the Washington Post, McAleenan is struggling to stay on the president\u2019s good side.\n\n\n\nMcAleenan tried to speak over the chants but was unsuccessful. \u201cAs a career law enforcement professional, I\u2019ve given my career to protecting the right to free speech and all the values we hold dear here in America, from all threats,\u201d he said after the protesters had stopped chanting. \u201cWe\u2019ll go ahead and try one more time, but otherwise I\u2019m going to go back to work and keep trying to secure this country.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the protesters started shouting the names of children who died in federal immigration custody. Members of the audience, including immigration lawyers and immigrants\u2019 rights advocates, grew increasingly frustrated with the protesters as the chants continued.\n\n\u201cOK, last time, team. A lot to cover today. There are some very serious issues that we can talk about today \u2014 in candor \u2014 or we can continue to shout.\u201d McAleenan said during his third attempt to start speaking. \u201cWhat I was going to start with is that I\u2019d like to take our dialogue this morning above politics and the daily news cycle and talk about some of the challenges and efforts we\u2019ve faced over the last year.\u201d\n\nBut after protesters began chanting over him again, McAleenan left the stage.\n\nThe protest, organized by CREDO Action, Sanctuary DMV, and other groups, spilled out to the front of the building -- a dozen students from the Georgetown University Law Center also demonstrated outside-- with additional support from more than 350 others who\u2019d signed a petition asking the university to disinvite McAleenan from the conference.\n\nCover: Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations, Monday, Sept. 23, 2019, in Washington.
