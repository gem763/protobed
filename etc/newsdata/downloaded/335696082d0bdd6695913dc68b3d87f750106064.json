He got run up in the wall with 50 to go and was frustrated about it and justifiably so. I went back and rewatched it. He pretty much got put in the wall on a straightaway. There\u2019s frustration with that.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cStopped Joey at the car and said we just don\u2019t need to handle that right now and let his emotions get down, and I thought they were at a point where he could go talk. Unfortunately, in the conversation there got to be a push (from Logano).\n\n\u201cThe direction that our organization has is separate drivers. We don\u2019t want to have drivers beating on each other. We\u2019ve had the conversation internally, we want situations diffused and separated. Unfortunately, in this situation that happened there, the separation was with too much power afterwards and I don\u2019t think the crew member \u2026 he was trying to separate the drivers and did so with probably more force than he anticipated and he\u2019s regretful of that.\n\n\u201cSee what NASCAR does that and where it goes. There weren\u2019t any punches or anything pulled. Denny got pulled out there and got pulled down pretty hard. Apologized to Denny for that and how that was handled. Ultimately, I\u2019ll put that one back on me to start with. I shouldn\u2019t have let Joey down there to start with. I probably made a poor decision in letting him go down and talk. A little bit of that is on me and we\u2019ll work forward from that. Understand Joey\u2019s frustration. I think it\u2019s genuine. What started the whole situation was what happened on the race track. We can talk about what happens in short track racing and all, 50 to go to get pushed up into the wall side-by-side it\u2019s going to frustrate you. I think if the roles were revered it\u2019s probably frustrating as much the other way. \u2026 We\u2019ll see what NASCAR does and we\u2019ll adapt to whatever comes forward.\u201d\n\nThis is the second consecutive weekend where drivers scuffled on pit road and crew members were involved. It happened after the Kansas Xfinity race the week before. Cole Custer and Tyler Reddick scuffled and crew members converged. NASCAR issued no penalties.\n\n\u201cI think if you go back to Kansas, we spent a lot of time reviewing that video and in our mind, always a judgment call but different incident,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see anybody really trying to escalate the situation.\n\n\u201cI think in this case (at Martinsville), you had a crew member who, honestly, I don\u2019t think realized the force with which he made that move. We have some light drivers and some big crew members and unfortunately that\u2019s what happens when those situations take place. I think they understand what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s not something we want to see or encourage but we\u2019ll have to address.\u201d\n\nAsked what kind of message NASCAR can send to crews about jumping into confrontations between drivers, O\u2019Donnell said:\n\n\u201cI think we have. I think we\u2019ve been consistent in our reaction and will be consistent here. This is a team sport and with any team sport, I think you\u2019re going to take care of your quarterback so to speak and you see that.\n\n\u201cWhat we can do is when we need to do address this with a penalty we will. When we see drivers, or in this case, crew members in Kansas trying to break something up, we won\u2019t react. It\u2019s case-by-case, but it\u2019s a passionate sport and there\u2019s a lot on the line and sometimes emotions go a little too far and we\u2019ve got to react.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "NASCAR's Steve O'Donnell told SiriusXM NASCAR Radio: 'I think what we saw was an aggressive move by a crew member.'", "authors": ["Dustin Long"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vay05RYIeppAVlHgwn4_CQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s8Vc0IOhfxqpd0u9B0liSw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/692eee21ba5550a2df69321480754620", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
