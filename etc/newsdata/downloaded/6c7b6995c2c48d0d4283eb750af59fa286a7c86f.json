Our customers and our team are empowered, outspoken, and active. This new campaign captures the level of frustration and the need to speak out louder than ever before,\u201d said Dhvani CEO Avi Brown.\n\n\u201cThis represents a proud and organic evolution of our brand identity. Our customers choose DHVANI for its quality and its commitment to directly support social change, and so do we by working with nonprofits that make a difference,\u201d she concluded.\n\nAs part of its #StandForSomething campaign, the company which is based in Portland, Oregon, posted other disturbing photos that show female models placing duct tape over the president\u2019s mouth and taking his phone away as he sits on a golden toilet.\n\nDhvani\u2019s chief communications officer, Chloe Mason, said the company is proud to join with Planned Parenthood \u201cin defending women from assaults on our reproductive rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump administration policies are threatening the health and bodily autonomy of women, especially women of color, low-income women and LGBTQ women,\u201d Mason concluded.\n\nThe company\u2019s website stated that its mission is to make a difference around the world and that women who wear the brand support \u201cprogressive change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to feel powerful and beautiful in your own body and skin. We want you to be valued and respected for who you are,\u201d the website concluded.", "description": "Clothing company Dhvani has turned off its Instagram comment section after receiving backlash for its anti-Trump ad campaign.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dhvani-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
