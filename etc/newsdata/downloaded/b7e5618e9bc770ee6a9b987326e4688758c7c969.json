It has, at times, spilled over into violent clashes.\n\nThe protest on Sunday 25 August, in the working-class district of Tsuen Wan, came after the first full week without incident since June. Some had hoped that the worst of the violence was over.\n\nIt did flare up, though, and with a new level of intensity. A warning shot was fired by a police officer - the first time a live round has been used since the demonstrations broke out in June. Also for the first time, water cannon made an appearance. And a 12-year-old was among dozens arrested - the youngest detained to date.\n\nAll of this has created a new sense of foreboding.\n\nThis is the story of one evening in Hong Kong.\n\nTelegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed\n\nThe Tsuen Wan protest began much like any other, with a group of people who wanted the city-wide outcry to be marked in their own neighbourhood.\n\nThere is only one way that can happen - via the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where there are dozens of groups dedicated to ensuring the protest movement stays alive, stays strategic, well organised and supplied.\n\nSome groups - with tens of thousands of members - discuss strategy. Smaller channels organise protest logistics and provide live updates about marches, while individual channels coordinate supplies, first aid, and even offer to make posters.\n\nIt was on Telegram where about a dozen or so strangers from Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan connected in June to organise the 25 August protest.\n\nOne of them was 26-year-old Potter.\n\n\u201cWe never thought we would do it by ourselves,\u201d he said, adding that none of them had done it before.\n\nWithin days, those well-established Telegram groups for promotion, medical volunteers, supply procurement and even drivers swung into action for Tsuen Wan.\n\nThere was even advice on how to negotiate with police to get permission to march.\n\nSunday 25 August - Preparing to march\n\nThe supplies team collected 10 large bags of water, bandages and other necessities, which had been mostly donated by enthusiastic residents.\n\n\u201cBefore the march, we had identified potential hotspots so we placed some supplies and protective gear nearby,\u201d said Vita, a volunteer.\n\n\u201cThe movement can only become so big because everybody contributes in their own way,\u201d Potter said.\n\nBut he was quick to say that he was not a leader of the movement - in fact no-one could be called that. Protesters know it\u2019s harder for the government to crack down if individuals can't be identified as faces of the movement.\n\nTheir spiritual predecessor was the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which called for universal suffrage. Seventy-nine days of occupying central Hong Kong won no concessions from the government and put the movement\u2019s leaders in jail.", "description": "", "authors": ["Saira Asher", "Grace Tsoi"], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/extra/shorthand/assets/news/1diisEsIvY/assets/cwgFNV4bJZ/2policepointingguns_reuters-2560x1396.jpeg"}
