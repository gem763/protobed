The 12.6-meter (41-foot) sculpture, fashioned from polychromed bronze, stainless steel, and aluminum, portrays a hand clasping a bouquet of balloon-like tulips.\n\nAt an inauguration ceremony attended by some families of the November 2015 Paris terror attacks, Koons called the flowers \u201ca symbol that life moves forward.\u201d He said the \u201cinflatable flowers represent loss, rebirth, and the vitality of the human spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did, as a citizen in New-York, experience 9/11 and the depression that hung over the city and it really took years for the city to be able to come to life again\u201d, Koons said.\n\nPatricia Correia, whose daughter was killed in the Bataclan concert hall attack, thanked Koons for his tribute. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong testament between the two countries and for me it represents the colors of life, the roots which are here and continue growing despite all the tragic events we went through,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It was finally placed in the gardens of the Champs-Elysees \u2014 between the Petit Palais and the Concorde plaza.\n\nCalling the work \u201ca gift from the heart,\u201d Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo described vibrant debate, particularly over art, as a hallmark of Parisian identity.\u201dNothing can be small in Paris,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is big in Paris \u2014emotions, controversies, and the traces that art leaves in our lives.\u201d\n\nPrivate French and American donors covered the costs of constructing and installing the sculpture.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The 12.6-meter (41-foot) sculpture, made from bronze, stainless steel and aluminum, shows a hand clasping a bouquet of balloon-like tulips.", "authors": ["Claire Parker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19277404776404.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
