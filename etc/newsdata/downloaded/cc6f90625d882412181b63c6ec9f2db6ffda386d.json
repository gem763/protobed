He was 83.\n\nThe league said Gregory died Wednesday at his home in Toronto. A cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nGregory spent a decade as general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs from the late 1960s until the late 1970s and was one of the first to import European players, most notably Swede Borje Salming. He spent almost 40 years with the NHL as director of central scouting, executive director of hockey operations and senior vice president of hockey operations and supervision.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to express the extent to which the National Hockey League family adored Jim Gregory and the loss we feel as a result of his passing,\u201d NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. \u201cJim Gregory wasn\u2019t just a great \u2018hockey man,\u2019 though he certainly was that. He was a great man - a devoted husband to Rosalie, his wife of 60 years; father to Andrea, Valerie, Maureen and David; grandfather of 13; and mentor and friend to too many to number.\u201d\n\nKnown around the sport as \u201cMr. Gregory,\u201d he served as chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee from 1998-2014 and was a fixture at the NHL draft and other league events. He\u2019d hand out silver sticks to players for reaching 1,000 games played, present new Hall of Famers with their rings and call names on the second day of the draft.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there was anyone who wasn\u2019t fond of Jimmy or would say a bad word about Jimmy,\u201d NHL executive vice president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell said by phone Wednesday. \u201cJimmy always put the game first and foremost. He cared so much about the good of the game and he carried that forward with trying to be helpful to everybody.\u201d\n\nRetired defenseman Aaron Ward on Twitter said of Gregory: \u201cThere\u2019s no better man and no better ambassador that represented the NHL so honorably. He was everywhere, at every event, and he\u2019d immediately make you smile just seeing him. That says enough about the man.\u201d\n\nGregory was elected to the Hall of Fame as a builder in 2007. Beyond his years running the Maple Leafs, he was central to the NHL\u2019s use of video to review goals and the expansion of the league\u2019s Central Scouting system.\n\nCampbell lamented the fact that Gregory\u2019s institutional memory is lost forever because so many at the league office looked to him for that.\n\n\u201cWhen we had issues of how the game got to be what it is, how this rule came to be, who these people were, how important was that person to the game, we always went to Jimmy,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe always had the answer.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jim Gregory, the Hockey Hall of Famer and popular longtime NHL executive best known for being one of the first to start bringing European players to North America, has died.
