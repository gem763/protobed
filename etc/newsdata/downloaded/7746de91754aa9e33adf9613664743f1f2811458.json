The British pound slipped 0.3% against the dollar.\n\nThe German DAX was up 0.5% and France's CAC 40 rose 0.2%. France on Thursday unveiled tax cuts on business and individuals in an effort to boost its economy.\n\nMeanwhile, markets were watching for comments later Friday from European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane for clues about the direction of policy.\n\nIn the U.S., futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The contracts don't necessarily predict moves after the opening bell.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys inched up to 1.706%, from 1.685% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nStocks were broadly lower in Asia, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 0.3%. Shares in Shanghai were an outlier, edging up 0.1%.\n\nChina's National Bureau of Statistics said Friday that Chinese industrial profits slipped 2% in August from the year before, after rising 2.6% in July. Producer-price deflation deepened last month, ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers that were already struggling with the prolonged trade war between China and the U.S., official data showed earlier.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures slipped 0.3% after Saudi Arabia said exports would soon return to normal after attacks on facilities earlier this month.\n\n\"Strong inventories, ongoing demand concerns, and a perceived fast ramp-up of lost Saudi production have overshadowed geopolitical risks for now,\" said Balint Balazs at Schneider Electric.\n\nLater Friday, the U.S. is set to publish consumer spending figures. Luis Costa, a head of foreign exchange strategy at Citibank, said he expects the data to remain resilient.\n\nThe European Commission released data Friday that showed business expectations for factories in the eurozone had become more negative than any other time in the last six years. The slump was particularly pronounced in Germany and Italy, the large eurozone economies that rely most on exports of goods to drive economic growth.\n\nThe relative strength of the U.S. economy has helped keep the dollar up against other currencies, Mr. Costa said.\n\nAnalysts at UniCredit said traders are torn between a positive outlook for a U.S.-China trade deal and worries about the political situation in Washington.\n\nLater in the day, investors will be watching for comments from Federal Reserve Vice Chair Randal Quarles for hints at future policy.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 06:21 ET (10:21 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
