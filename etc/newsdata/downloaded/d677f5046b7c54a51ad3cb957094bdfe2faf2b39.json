University lecturing, children, siblings, dead parents, potential grandchildren, wedding rings, languages, Iran, China, Dignitas, bad dates, exes.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nWe both mistook the fruit-topped cheesecake as being the tiramisu we had ordered.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nOf course.\n\nBest thing about Alex?\n\nSimpatico.\n\nWould you introduce her to your friends?\n\nOh yes. She would be a great asset to a party.\n\nDescribe her in three words\n\nSophisticated, Italian, charming.\n\nWhat do you think she made of you?\n\nA pleasant evening\u2019s conversation.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nOnly to the station.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nSubtly.

Geoffrey is a great conversationalist. We laughed a lot.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nI did not pay attention to the menu and ended up choosing the wrong starter. I could not eat it and had to alert the waitress to take it away. Geoffrey was too polite to say anything but there was this awkward wait. There was also a mix-up with a tiramisu that was not a tiramisu at all.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nYes, definitely.\n\nBlind date: \u2018We hadn\u2019t finished the main course before he asked for my number\u2019 Read more\n\nBest thing about Geoffrey?\n\nHis easy-going manner and friendliness.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\nSure.

The food was altogether very good; it was an oversight on my part.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\nA good 8.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nAs friends. He gave me his card.\n\n\u2022 Alex and Geoffrey ate at Chucs Cafe Kensington, London SW7.\n\n\n\nFancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.
