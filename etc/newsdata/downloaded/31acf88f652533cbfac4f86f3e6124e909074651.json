U.S. and Saudi officials are investigating whether the attacks involved cruise missiles fired from Iraq or Iran, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Sunday rebuffed any suggestion that it was involved. A ministry spokesman called the allegations \u201cakin to the plots hatched by secret and intelligence services for damaging the image of a state to prepare the ground for a series of [hostile] measures in future.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Javad Zarif said the U.S. had failed at a \u201cmax pressure\u201d campaign and was now focused on \u201cmax deceit.\u201d Mr. Zarif said the U.S. should stop blaming Iran and accept the conditions demanded by Tehran to begin talks.\n\nThe coordinated strikes forced Saudi Arabia to suspend production of 5.7 million barrels of oil a day, more than half of its output and over 5% of the global supply. The Saudi stock market, the Tadawul, fell 3% on Sunday and oil investors braced for crude prices to climb when trading begins later in the day in Asia.\n\nMost of the oil output could be restored within days, but it will take weeks to return to full capacity, according to people familiar with the damage estimates in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi national oil company, known as Aramco, has assessed that its facilities were hit by missiles, people familiar with the matter said. A U.S. government assessment determined that up to 15 structures at Abqaiq, a large processing facility, suffered damage from the strike on their west-northwest-facing sides.\n\nOne person familiar with the damage at Abqaiq said the facility was \u201ca wreck.\u201d The person said production capacity was \u201cheavily impacted.\u201d\n\nSaudi officials didn\u2019t lay blame for the attack, neither on Iran nor the Houthis, calling the strikes a terrorist attack.\n\nThe weekend strikes triggered a series of emergency meetings in Washington, where members of the White House National Security Council deputies committee were expected to meet Sunday to discuss the U.S. response.\n\nThe U.S. has satellite imagery and other surveillance data that some in the Trump administration are looking to declassify and release to bolster their claims that Iran was responsible for the strike, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe strikes mark an apparent breakdown in Saudi defenses. The kingdom is among the world\u2019s largest buyers of weapons and has Patriot missile batteries in the region of the oil facilities. The U.S. sent hundreds of fresh troops to Saudi Arabia this summer, most of them stationed in Prince Sultan Air Base southeast of Riyadh, the Journal reported.\n\nPresident Trump called Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday to condemn the attacks and express support for Saudi Arabia, according to a statement from the Saudi government.\n\nMr. Trump had expressed interest in meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week to ease tensions that have risen since Washington withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran and this year has blamed it for a series of provocations, including striking at Saudi oil infrastructure.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attacks appeared to make a meeting less likely.\n\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh warned Sunday on Iranian television that American military targets were within range of his country\u2019s missiles.\n\n\u201cWe have constantly prepared ourselves for a full-fledged war,\u201d Gen. Hajizadeh said.\n\nIraq denied suggestions that the attacks had originated from its territory. The prime minister\u2019s office said Iraq was committed to preventing its territory being used as a launchpad for attacks against its neighbors.\n\nBut the Iraqi government has limited control over several powerful Iran-backed militias that operate within its borders. Their presence in Iraq has undermined the Iraqi government\u2019s efforts to remain neutral as tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen.\n\n\u2014Isabel Coles, Michael Amon and Vivian Salama contributed to this article.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif\u2019s first name as Javid.
