These pans heat instantly. They feel substantial; which I like. I think one of my favorite thing is how the handles don't get hot. But my absolute favorite thing about this cookware is that I will never, ever have to replace it. I replace my non-stick at least once a year. I wish I had discovered Stainless Steel earlier in life. Oh the money I could have saved... I've never cooked on Stainless Steel before, so I did a lot of research. There are 2 key things you must do to be successful with this cookware: 1) Season your pans and 2) Preheat your pan before putting food in. 1 - How to season pans: Season your pans before you do anything else. Wash them with soap and water. Dry them. Rub olive, peanut or coconut oil into the entire surface inside the pan. Put into the oven at 350F for about an hour; They should be smoking, yes, smoking when you remove them. This makes them non-stick when you follow suggestion #2. 2 - Preheat your pan. Make sure the pan is hot before you put food into it. If you think it is hot, it probably isn't hot enough, wait until it is hotter. If the ingredients are not fatty or oily, add a little olive oil to the pan during the pre-heat. To find out if it is hot enough, drop a couple of drops of water. If they spray and spirt and splatter, your ready to cook! The first couple of times I cook, my food stuck, even though I did season my pans. This is because I did not make the pan hot enough before cooking. Don't give up; these pans will give you an amazing cooking experience once you figure it out. A couple of other hints: -- The food will feel stuck to the pan while it is cooking. When it is finished, it won't be stuck anymore. You can test it by lifting the corner, but when it's finished, it will be loose and ready to flip. -- I also like that I can put these into the oven. Now I sear my meat and put it into the oven to finish cooking. -- One last suggestion is how to clean them. Once you season your pans, never use soap to clean them. This will remove that nice seasoning you put on it. Instead, use hot water and a scrubby sponge. Hot water is the key. If you do have to use soap, know that the seasoning will be removed and you'll need to season them again.", "description": "Free 2-day shipping.
