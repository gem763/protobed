There are well-defined limits to the number of friends and acquaintances the average person can retain. But the question about whether these limits are the same in today\u2019s digital world \u2013 one in which it\u2019s common to have social media profiles, or online forums, with thousands of followers \u2013 is more complicated.\n\nAccording to British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, the \u201cmagic number\u201d is 150. Dunbar became convinced that there was a ratio between brain sizes and group sizes through his studies of non-human primates. This ratio was mapped out using neuroimaging and observation of time spent on grooming, an important social behaviour of primates. Dunbar concluded that the size, relative to the body, of the neocortex \u2013 the part of the brain associated with cognition and language \u2013 is linked to the size of a cohesive social group. This ratio limits how much complexity a social system can handle.\n\n\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The numbers that can lead to disaster\n\n\u2022 Is social media bad for you?\n\n\u2022 The \u20183.5% rule\u2019: How a small minority can change the world\n\nDunbar and his colleagues applied this basic principle to humans, examining historical, anthropological and contemporary psychological data about group sizes, including how big groups get before they split off or collapse. They found remarkable consistency around the number 150.\n\nAccording to Dunbar and many researchers he influenced, this rule of 150 remains true for early hunter-gatherer societies as well as a surprising array of modern groupings: offices, communes, factories, residential campsites, military organisations, 11th Century English villages, even Christmas card lists. Exceed 150, and a network is unlikely to last long or cohere well. (One implication for the era of urbanisation may be that, to avoid alienation or tensions, city residents should find quasi-villages within their cities.)", "description": "The theory of Dunbar\u2019s number holds that we can only really maintain about 150 connections at once.
