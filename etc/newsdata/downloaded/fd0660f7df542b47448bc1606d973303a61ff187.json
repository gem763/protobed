Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached,\u201d Kelly recalled in an interview at the Sea Island Summit, a political conference hosted by the Examiner. Kelly said he does not believe the president would be in his current predicament if he had stayed as chief of staff.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement of her own Saturday: \u201cI worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great President.\u201d\n\nTrump pushed back on Kelly\u2019s comments in a statement: \u201cJohn Kelly never said that, he never said anything like that. If he would have said that, I would have thrown him out of the office. He just wants to come back into the action like everybody else does.\u201d\n\nThe House is expected to vote on articles of impeachment by Christmas, with a trial to follow in the Senate to determine whether Trump should be removed from office.\n\nThe proceedings were sparked by allegations that the president asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival seeking the Democratic nomination and into the 2016 election.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, John Kelly, says he advised the president not to fill the job with someone who wouldn\u2019t be honest with him...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ954_Kelly__ZG_20181207163339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
