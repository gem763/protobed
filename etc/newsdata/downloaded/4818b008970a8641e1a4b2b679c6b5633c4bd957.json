He is such a superstar, a champion horse, but when I was walking in with the boys today, I said this is what racing is about, champions get beat and let\u2019s hope we do it today,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have been saying it for a while now, I think Rise High is the next big thing in Hong Kong and he is slowly starting to get there.\u201d\n\nFownes admits he was given an almighty fright when John Size\u2019s Waikuku sneaked up inside his galloper and went toe-to-toe up the straight after they left Beauty Generation in their wake.\n\nWhat a stunner! Rise High halts Beauty Generation's win streak at 10. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/lD81tp4pTR \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cHe came out and it looked like Waikuku was really going to challenge us, which he did but we stuck our neck out at the last part,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was looking like a dream until Waikuku sneaked up the inside \u2013 the clacker got a little bit tight.\u201d\n\nFownes was delighted for his former apprentice Vincent Ho Chak-yiu, who secured his biggest win in the race, expertly piloting Rise High off the rail and into clear running in the straight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great for Vincent too, it is always hard when you are just below the top ranks, there are always big boys kicking up for the ride but the owners have been good, they\u2019ve let me take my time with this horse which has made him, so it is great to see Vincent do that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHopefully he will get the job done again [in November] and then again in December.\u201d\n\nFownes now faces an agonising decision for Rise High, whether to push on in search of even more ground in the Group One Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) in December or settle for the Hong Kong Cup (2,000m) on the same day.\n\nHe said his decision was going to be heavily influenced by the European import\u2019s performance against reigning Vase champion Exultant next month.\n\n\u201cHe keeps improving, every season he is getting stronger, he has shown us that. He will climb up the ratings now, probably 128 or 129, so I am looking forward to seeing him when he gets over the right trip, it is exciting times ahead,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNext start we are up against Exultant who has been a superstar stayer here, I think he will run before that so fitness-wise, we will be on the similar level and we should be able to see who is the better horse over 2,000m.\n\n\u201cHe will be entered for the 2,000m and the 2,400m so we will have a look and make the decision after his next run.\u201d\n\nFownes\u2019 warhorse Southern Legend also managed to take home prize money from the race, holding on to finish fifth.", "description": "Group One contender Rise High has dethroned Hong Kong\u2019s champion galloper Beauty Generation, putting to bed any concerns there may have been about his ability to perform at the top level....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/20/1a065b58-f325-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_184732.JPG?itok=FLrUgOhW&v=1571568460", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
