He has now, unfortunately, had to re-enter a treatment program to work on his recovery again,\u201d the musicians said. \u201cWe fully intend to make our way to your part of the world as soon as health and schedule permit. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the band said it was \u201cdevastated that we have inconvenienced so many of you, especially our most loyal fans who often travel great distances to experience our shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your understanding and support for James and, as always, thank you for being a part of our Metallica family.\u201d\n\nAll tickets for the eight-show WorldWired tour, which was set to kick off on Oct. 17, will be fully refunded.\n\nIn a 2016 podcast interview on the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience,\u201d Hetfield opened up about his stint in rehab in 2001 to overcome alcohol and drug abuse, calling fear \u201ca big motivator.\u201d\n\n\u201cLosing my family \u2015 that was the thing that scared me so much, that was the bottom I hit that my family is going to go away because of the behaviors that I brought home from the road,\u201d he said. \u201cI got kicked out of the house by my wife. I was living on my own somewhere, and I did not want that.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the interview, Hetfield said he had been sober for 15 years, noting that rehab \u201creally worked\u201d for him.\n\nDescribing the experience, he said it involved \u201cbasically tearing you down to bones, ripping your life apart, anything you thought about yourself or what it was, anything you thought you had, your family, your career, your anything \u2015 gone. Strip you down to just, \u2018Ok, you\u2019re born ... Let\u2019s get back to that again.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was raw meat when I came out,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I could, or what I should or shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said that he and his wife Francesca were prepared to tackle their challenges head-on.\n\n\u201cNo matter what\u2019s going on, we\u2019re going to talk this stuff out, and make it work.\u201d", "description": "The metal band is postponing eight shows in Australia and New Zealand as its frontman recovers from his battle with addiction.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8f8edd2100003700fcf4b2.jpeg?cache=lzx2hju8va&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
