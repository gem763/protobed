That figure has hardly budged in the last decade.\n\nAbout 45 million working Americans don\u2019t have access to a retirement plan through their employers, Grumet noted, and that 30 millions 30 million of those Americans would sign up if offered one.\n\nThe legislation, called the SECURE Act, would make it simpler and cheaper for small businesses to offer workplace retirement plans to their employers. It increases access for part-time workers, provides tax incentives to small employers and makes it easier to create automatic enrollments.\n\nThe bill is currently on a procedural hold in the Senate, but Grumet expects it to pass once it moves forward.\n\nWhile its passage is a step in the right direction, Grumet acknowledged that it doesn\u2019t address the future funding issues with Social Security benefits, which currently make up about a third of older Americans\u2019 income.\n\nThe growing imbalance between the number of working adults funding the social program and the number of seniors tapping it will create a funding shortage in 15 years, he said, slicing benefits by 20%.\n\nThe SECURE Act is \u201ca first step\u201d in securing Americans\u2019 retirements, Grumet said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the answer to our nation\u2019s retirement security,\u201d he added, \u201cbut at least it gets the ball rolling towards an issue that is really affecting tens of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nJanna is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
