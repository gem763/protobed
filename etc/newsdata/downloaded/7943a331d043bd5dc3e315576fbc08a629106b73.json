The calls for the prosecutor's removal were backed by international groups who said he was not doing enough to battle corruption.\n\nUkrainian officials found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens, but Ruslan Ryaboshapka, the country\u2019s general prosecutor, vowed to take another look at the case.\n\n\"I have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by Rudy Giuliani about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin,\" Graham said in a statement.\n\nHouse Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry related to the president's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings and the company's relationship to the Bidens. Backed by a whistleblower's complaint, Democrats claimed Trump used the power of his office \u2013 including military aid as leverage \u2013 to go after Biden, one of his chief rivals in the 2020 election. Trump said he was motivated by a desire to root out corruption.\n\nPoll: Majority of Americans say House Democrats right to open Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nExplainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nRudy Giuliani may be called to testify before senators. More\n\nTuesday, Graham indicated his planned invitation for Giuliani to testify was partly in response to the impeachment inquiry in the House, which Republican lawmakers said is being conducted unfairly.\n\n\"Given the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\" Graham said. \"Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the Committee of his concerns.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Graham said, \"Unlike the House of Representatives, I\u2019m tired of only hearing one side of the story. It\u2019s now time to give voice to everything Ukraine.\n\n\"Let the chips fall where they may!\"\n\n'America's mayor' to Trump's pit bull: Rudy Giuliani emerges as central figure in Ukraine firestorm\n\n'Nobody pushed me': Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Trump phone call\n\nUnlike the House of Representatives, I\u2019m tired of only hearing one side of the story.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now time to give voice to everything Ukraine.\n\n\n\nLet the chips fall where they may!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2019\n\nGraham's invitation to Giuliani was enthusiastically supported by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee.\n\n\"I welcome the opportunity to question Rudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s assistance to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals,\" Feinstein said in a statement.\n\n\"Democratic members have plenty of questions for Mr. Giuliani and this would give us an opportunity to help separate fact from fiction for the American people,\" she said.\n\n\"We welcome Mr Giuliani testifying,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a tweet. \"Given the apparent depth of his involvement in the president\u2019s effort to convince foreign governments to investigate a political rival, he must testify under oath.\"", "description": "Democrats embraced Graham's idea, saying they would welcome the opportunity to question Giuliani under oath.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aVQyxk_Ano.tvqK2cmGwhg--~B/aD0yMTQzO3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/e1be31453ed7d1a7c58d908d95337b4c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
