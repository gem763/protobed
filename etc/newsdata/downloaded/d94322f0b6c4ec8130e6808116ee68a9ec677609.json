And Matt Morrison (who played teacher Will Schuester) knew I was taking part, we still talk so we know what each other is up to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They also knew how much of a fan of The X Factor I was I have loved the show for years, so they are excited for me.\u2019\n\nKevin McHale with his former Glee pals (Picture: FOX via Getty Images)\n\nKevin, who played Artie Abrams in the teen musical, went on to explain that he gets asked about a Glee reunion all the time.\n\nHe added: \u2018We are all friends so we get together all the time and I do get the reboot question a lot and who knows?\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t imagine it and I would be surprised, but if it happened it would need to be something different, where you can do it with a brand new cast.\n\n\u2018And it\u2019s based in a high school and they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe 31-year-old, who shot to fame in 2009 and was also in a boyband prior to Glee, has made it through to the next round of the live shows and will perform again on Saturday.\n\nAnd despite nailing his audition and first performance, he denied having an advantage over the other contestants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think I am the one most known to have done music in my past but if anyone takes anything from the first episode they will know that everyone is on an even playing ground, he continued.\n\n\u2018In Glee, there were 80 of us and in the Glee tour, I think I only sang two songs. It is a really different thing to be out there by myself and I understand how it comes off that I might have an advantage but just know I don\u2019t feel that.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
