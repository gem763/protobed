We want the state to have immediate success.\"\n\nThe cross-border shelling of civilian areas by the Kurdish militants has also hardened attitudes.\n\nAt the emotionally charged funeral of a nine-month-old baby on Friday in nearby Akcakale, there were angry chants of \"Martyrs are immortal, our land is indivisible\" and \"Damn the PKK\", referring to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party that has fought a violent insurgency against the Turkish state for the past 35 years.\n\nThere has been a heavy military build-up around the Turkey-Syria border area\n\nThe region is no stranger to violence. In July 2015, a jihadist attack on Kurds in Suruc killed 33.\n\nShortly after, a two-and-a-half-year ceasefire between the government and the PKK collapsed, triggering more unrest.\n\n\"We want peace,\" said Sarya Dogan, one of those attending Saturday's funeral.\n\n\"What is this, war and more war? We are all brothers and sisters,\" she said.\n\nHundreds of families have evacuated the border towns, which the government says have been hit by more than 300 mortar shells since the operation began.\n\nThere has been quiet criticism that more was not done to protect them before it started.\n\nBut others are fiercely proud of the troops and have come to the frontier to watch the strikes hit the Kurdish-held town of Ras al-Ain in Syria.\n\n\"We've come to support our soldiers, our state, our people,\" said Bub Aslanli, a farmer in Ceylanpinar. \"We are praying for them.\"", "description": "Bearing the brunt of fierce Kurdish counter-attacks, Turkish residents on the frontline of the new offensive into Syria are longing for the return of peace...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/18/wire-19631894-1570900966-966_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
