This is the big surprise. One year ago a lot of people were asking themselves was it too early, was it the right decision?\n\nTech3 explains surprise 2020 MotoGP rider choice More\n\n\"Now I think the team and Yamaha think 'thank God, we took the right decision.\n\n\"So I'm not saying Iker is going to do what Fabio is doing, but I have a good feeling, and we need to look at young riders, we need to prepare the future.\n\n\"I just love Iker; the way he rides, the way he is. This is the man we need.\"\n\nLecuona made his circuit racing debut in 2016 in the CEV Moto2 class, and has two podiums to his credit in his three years in grand prix racing.\n\nDespite having a deal for Moto2 in 2020 with Ajo Motorsport, Lecuona says it only took him \"five minutes\" to agree to Tech3 and KTM's offer.\n\n\"I had the option of going to MotoGP and logically I said yes,\" Lecuona stated. \"It didn't take me 10 hours, [it took] five minutes to say yes. I had a contract with Ajo and I was very happy. It disrupted everything.\n\n\"I've been [racing on short circuits] for four years. No one has made such a jump.\n\n\"I know that you have to be lucky to get where I am and that all the stars line up, so when a person looks for someone you are there.\n\n\"But it's also true that I've worked hard. I know that next year if I was in Moto2 I can fight for the world championship.\n\n\"That was one of the reasons why I said yes to going to MotoGP. When you're ahead, winning it or not, you're very prepared.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Tech3 MotoGP team boss Herve Poncharal says Fabio Quartararo's sensational rookie season in 2019 was partly behind his desire to sign Moto2 underdog Iker Lecuona for next year", "authors": ["Lewis Duncan", "Oriol Puigdemont"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3hBOXOoVIrhb_exwaen_mQ--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/f49e757586fb3643a3a452c8e149b30f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
