In contrast, the biggest annual rise for iron ore was 426 basis points in 2007-08, 605 basis points for coal (also 2007-08) and 267 basis points for travel in 2014-15.\n\nThe best growth recorded in these three industries outstrips the best growth in the ICT sectors by a factor of 2.7, 3.9 and 1.7.\n\nWhile Australia remains a good source of coal and iron ore, for the period between 2002 to 2017 Australia generated only $US33 ($48) per resident, while Singapore generated $US2560 per resident.\n\nIf we overlay the IPO dates of Altium (August 1999), Atlassian (December 2015), and WiseTech (April 2016), we can see small increases in the export activity of our ICT sector. You have to wonder whether this already flat line might have dipped further without the activities of these three.\n\nHow do we compare with other markets? The most obvious one to compare is the US. Here\u2019s its ICT export chart, alongside Australia\u2019s:\n\nAustralia's ICT exports compared to the US. Digivizer\n\nWhat we see in the US is consistent growth, even after the original dotcom bust. The sector is back to where it peaked just before the GFC. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s ICT export recovery was slower and flatter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecision time for Australia\n\nEvery stakeholder in this economic story needs to up its game. In the start-up and growth stages within the ICT sector we must continue to force our ideas, products and services to the global market, position for exports from day one, and push the government and lobby groups harder to help support those early growth stages.\n\nThe government of the day must decide on its long-term vision for Australia. If it does not believe in supporting home-grown companies creating new value in new ways that can be exported unimpeded, they should at the very least remove any obstacles to allowing us to do so on our own.\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s National Innovation and Science Agenda was announced in December 2015, and you can see a slight rise in export activity at the same time. Yet that commitment has been diluted and fragmented.\n\nI welcome the recent investigations of the impact the R &D changes have had, and support the recent initiatives such as the Boosting Female Founders Initiative and review of the Export Market Development Grants scheme. But, these are small initiatives when bigger changes are needed in education, infrastructure, resources, funding, investment and tax concessions.\n\nLong-term commitments are needed. Industries such as ICT, pharmaceuticals, medical products, deep technology and manufacturing are needed to create the economic future and competitive playing field we deserve in Australia, not to mention maintain our standard of living.\n\nEmma Lo Russo is the chief executive of social web analytics company Digivizer.", "description": "Every stakeholder in this economic story needs to up its game and the government of the day must decide on its long-term vision for Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1219%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_57/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c1fce58edd16424f81ba72a6bbf461e832505498", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
