Over the course of the past four decades, terrorists have learned how to use the media to spread their messages of fear. And now, this relationship is undergoing another troubling transformation which is connecting us directly to them for the first time.\n\nTerrorists have become content creators\n\nIf broadcast television and portable cameras were the technology that first brought terrorism into our homes, the emergence of new technologies have brought terrorists even further into our lives. Cell phone cameras have allowed terrorists to stage and film their own attacks reducing their previous reliance on broadcast media.\n\nThe rise of social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have created a multitude of new channels and platforms for terrorist organizations to broadcast their message directly to. This gives them more intimate access to audiences and even allows them to target specific users.\n\nGroups like ISIS now film footage of gruesome executions and share it with the general public without impunity. Some of their horrifying messages of terror are even used as recruiting videos to attract new members.\n\nOther tech companies such as Telegram, an encrypted social messaging app, have been used by terrorists to communicate with each other and plan their attacks.\n\nLive streaming\u2019 makes it even easier for violence to be captured in the blink of an eye and then instantly distributed to the masses. This tactic was employed most recently during the attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that social media has become the leading communication tool for terrorists worldwide.\n\nThe responsibility of digital media companies\n\nOrganizations that own the social media platforms being employed by terrorists have been under scrutiny for not doing enough to stem their use. Over the past three years, Twitter has deleted a total of 1.2 million accounts that promoted terrorism. Facebook claims that 99% of the content they delete relating to terrorism is identified by artificial intelligence.\n\nYet their actions and words often echo similar attitudes from media companies of the past generation \u2014 their role is not censorship but distribution. Governments have little direct leverage over these companies and how they operate. Former U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May believes investors should play a role by pressuring technology companies to take action. \"Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered,\" she says.\n\nWe are helping terrorists spread their message too\n\nPhoto: istock\n\nNow we all have the ability to capture high-quality footage from the phones in our pockets making us potential operators in the terrorists\u2019 camera crew. When the offices of Charlie Hedbo were attacked by two Islamic extremists, a local policeman attempted to stop the assailants. An eyewitness used his phone to capture the gunmen as they executed the wounded policeman on the pavement outside the magazine\u2019s offices.\n\nNews organizations often use content shot by onlookers in their reporting and when we share these stories we become unwitting accomplices in helping terrorists spread their message of fear.\n\nAs we educate ourselves about the dynamic between terrorists and the media, being aware of the role we play on social media can help break the cycle.\n\nThis article was created for After Munich a documentary that explores the emotional aftermath the Munich Massacre over 45 years later.
