What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism.

However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017.

The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh.

I promise that.'

The Twitter user had accused the politician of not being \u201cindigenous English\u201d.\n\nThe report also discovered that neo-Nazi groups in America had actively encouraged supporters to target public figures in a bid to widen their exposure.\n\nExcerpts from a playbook produced by the US neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer, advised that the best way to gain \u201cmedia attention and general infamy\u201d was \u201cto troll public figures and get them to whine about it\u201d.\n\nMr Lineker, presenter of BBC\u2019s Match Of The Day and winner of the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup, said he was determined to \u201cshow online trolls the red card\u201d after seeing the racist abuse directed at young black Premier League footballers.\n\nChelsea striker Tammy Abraham, 21, admitted his mother was in tears after reading the torrent of racist comments targeted towards him after he missed the decisive penalty in the European Super Cup against Liverpool last month.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow England international and Manchester United marksman Marcus Rashford suffered a similar backlash after missing a spot kick against Crystal Palace in a league match this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been shocked by the way in which racist trolls have been targeting footballers recently,\u201d Mr Lineker said.\n\n\u201cIt is frankly horrifying that they have done so in a calculated way to spread their abhorrent views. Let\u2019s not allow the beautiful game to be tarnished in this way.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rise to the bait, block the trolls and take some time out.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Mr Khan encouraged more people to play their part in tackling online hate, stating that there is \u201ctremendous power\u201d in the way users react to social media conversations.\n\n\u201cBy ignoring, muting or blocking the trolls we can deny them the reactions they seek, while government and social media companies must up their game to ensure it is a safe space for people to exchange ideas,\u201d Mr Khan said.\n\nFormer Strictly Come Dancing contestant Riley also revealed that she has been on the receiving end of antisemitic abuse and was involved in the research behind the report.\n\nShe said the experience had \u201ctotally changed\" the way she interacted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cBefore having CCDH\u2019s knowledge it felt like not responding to trolls or blocking them was weak, and calling them out, trying to engage in conversation and education was helpful, but the research shows otherwise,\u201d Riley said.\n\n\u201cI now block trolls as common practice, and have changed my settings to avoid seeing much of their output, which has made life much better from a mental health standpoint and vitally, is not inadvertently helping to grow their audiences or feed their negativity.\u201d", "description": "A group of celebrities and politicians have pledged to fight online abuse by refusing to reveal the hateful messages they receive on social media.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/14/11/rachel-riley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
