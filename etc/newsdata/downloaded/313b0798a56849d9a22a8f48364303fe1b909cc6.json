Adam Schiff says he wasn't informed before al-Baghdadi operation originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., were not informed in advance of the U.S. special operations forces raid in northwestern Syria in which ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died, Schiff told ABC\u2019s \"This Week\"\n\n\"My understanding [Pelosi] wasn\u2019t [told]. But a couple of things, first of all, good riddance. [Al-Baghdadi] was a bloodthirsty killer to the degree that he retained operational control of ISIS,\" Schiff said. \"This is an operational success, this is a symbolic victory. He had the blood of thousands and thousands of people on his hands, including many Americans and American journalists. So, this a great day, a ruthless killer has been brought to justice.\"\n\nSchiff appeared on \"This Week\" moments after President Donald Trump announced the outcome of the raid that took place in northwestern Syria on Saturday.\n\n\"Last night the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead,\" the president said in remarks Sunday morning from the White House.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump speaks in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, Oct. 27, 2019.

He ignited his vest killing himself and three children. His body was mutilated from the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain immediate and totally positive identification. It was him,\" the president said.\n\n(MORE: State Department official appears under subpoena as part of impeachment probe)\n\nFollowing his statement, Trump was asked by a reporter if he had notified any congressional leaders, including the speaker of the House. He replied, \"We\u2019ve notified some. Others are being notified now, as I speak. We were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks (are) like I've never seen before.\"\n\nPHOTO: Chairman of the US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Adam Schiff (R), and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hold a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on October 15, 2019.

The move means that a federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney John Durham, will now have the authority to subpoena witnesses, impanel a grand jury and potentially bring criminal charges.\n\n\"If these reports are correct and now Bill Barr\u2019s Justice Department is doing a criminal investigation of people who properly looked into Russian interference in our election \u2026 it means that Bill Barr, on the president\u2019s behalf, is weaponizing the Justice Department to go after the president\u2019s enemies,\" Schiff told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz.\n\nSchiff said it did not matter even if Durham, the federal prosecutor, was well respected, telling Raddatz, \"You can assign good people to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals. It doesn\u2019t mean the investigation is any less tainted.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans have criticized the way Schiff has conducted the impeachment inquiry, with some members of the House pushing to censure the California representative this week. In the Senate, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced a resolution, co-sponsored by over 40 other Republicans, which called for the House to vote to formally initiate the impeachment inquiry.", "description": "House Intelligence Chair Rep.
