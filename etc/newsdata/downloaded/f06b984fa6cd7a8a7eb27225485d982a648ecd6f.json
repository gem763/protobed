While the downbeat data raises the prospect that Chinese\n\npolicymakers could prepare more measures to boost growth,\n\nanalysts and market players said Beijing has relatively little\n\nroom for significant easing.\n\n\"How much traction is monetary policy going to get? If there\n\nis any short-term move (higher) here in Asia it will genuinely\n\nbe only short-term players because we're not far from printing\n\n5% in China GDP, and that's not going to be good for risk\n\nassets,\" said Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how excited you get about stimulus, it is\n\nnot going to be good for risk assets.\"\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas down 0.3% by around 0612 GMT, erasing\n\nearlier small gains. Australian shares dropped 0.52% and\n\nChinese blue-chips were off 1.53%. Japan's Nikkei\n\nended 0.18% higher.\n\nSterling, which had enjoyed its biggest rising streak since\n\nOctober 1985 and hit a five-month high on the back of the Brexit\n\ndeal, gave up ground on Friday morning amid doubts that the\n\nagreement would receive parliamentary approval. The pound eased\n\n0.29% to buy $1.2850.\n\n\"Whatever was agreed last night with the EU still has to go\n\nthrough the British parliament...the uncertainty surrounding\n\nthat still hasn't changed one iota,\" said James McGlew,\n\nexecutive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut in\n\nPerth, Australia.\n\nEquity markets had enjoyed a bounce on Thursday from the\n\ninitial Brexit deal news, with the S&P 500 briefly\n\ntopping 3,000 points for the first time in more than three\n\nweeks.\n\nHelping to alleviate immediate trade war worries, China said\n\non Thursday that it hoped to reach a phased agreement in its\n\ntrade dispute with the United States as soon as possible.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by upbeat earnings from\n\nNetflix and Morgan Stanley MS.N , but poor results\n\nfrom International Business Machines Corp IBM.N and weak U.S.\n\neconomic data weighed.\n\nHousing starts, industrial production and mid-Atlantic\n\nfactory output all fell short of economist expectations.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.09% to\n\n27,025.88, the S&P 500 finished up 0.28% at 2,997.97 and\n\nthe Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4% to 8,156.85.\n\nOn Friday, S&P 500 e-mini stock futures , were down\n\n0.23% at 2,991.25.\n\nReflecting the cautious mood, the yield on benchmark 10-year\n\nTreasury notes fell to 1.7396% compared with a U.S.\n\nclose of 1.755% on Thursday.\n\nIn the currency market, the safe-haven yen strengthened,\n\nwith the dollar falling 0.13% to 108.51, while the euro\n\nwas flat on the day at $1.1123.\n\nThe dollar index , which tracks the greenback against\n\na basket of six major rivals, was barely lower at 97.599.\n\nOil fell, with Brent crude easing 0.52% to $59.60\n\nand U.S. crude dropping 0.19% to $53.83.\n\nSpot gold rose to $1,492.25 per ounce.
