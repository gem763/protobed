You only have one chance to make a strong enough impression to make it to the short list (and eventually get that job), which is why it helps to be prepared.\n\nWhile jobs differ across the board, there are often a host of common question that almost everyone has encountered.\n\nThese questions may seem like they\u2019re relatively simple to answer because we\u2019ve all seen them before, but the problem is that they often trip many people up because they inspire generic and sometimes lazy responses instead of original ones.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to bumble your way through questions that you already know or expect.\n\nHere is a list of questions you should always be able to answer:\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nPrintable cheat sheet for your next job interview\n\n1. Tell me about yourself\n\nThis is probably one of the hardest questions to answer as it normally comes first and will set the tone for the rest of the interview.\n\nAccording to The Muse.com, you should think about this question as the perfect opportunity to deliver a sales pitch, the selling point being you in this particular scenario. Bear in mind that the hiring manager already has your CV on hand, so avoid regurgitating all the facts they already know.\n\nInstead, using concrete examples of your career history, explain why you\u2019ve chosen the field you\u2019re in and provide a few of your career highlights and list of achievements. Use the opportunity to also expand on how your career goals will fit in with the position you\u2019re applying for.\n\nWhen listing your highlights and experiences, show how the experience you\u2019ve built up in previous positions make you suitable for the role you\u2019re applying for.\n\n2. What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?\n\nNo one likes answering this, but it certainly is easier to play up one\u2019s strength as opposed to one\u2019s weaknesses.\n\nWhen it comes to listing one\u2019s strengths, it\u2019s easy to ramble and fall prey to the urge to rattle off a long list of what you\u2019re good at.\n\nAnswering the question that focuses on your weaknesses is never pleasant, but remember that recruiters aren\u2019t necessarily trying to catch you out or deliberately \u201cfail\u201d you.\n\nFor many this is a test of self-awareness and accountability, so answer as honestly as possible, but also counter your weak points with steps you are taking to improve them.\n\nFor example, you could mention that you\u2019re struggling with an area in data analytics, but mention that you\u2019re taking additional courses to help your understanding. This shows that you\u2019re proactive and that you\u2019re willing to take initiative to grow and improve your skills.\n\n\n\nRemember: companies don\u2019t seek perfection, but they do look for people who are willing to put in the extra work when it\u2019s required.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n5 dead giveaway signs that your interview went well\n\n3. What are your salary expectations?\n\nThe answer to this question can be tricky, but you can also work this to your advantage by ensuring that you\u2019ve done your research.\n\nVisit comparison sites to check and ensure that you\u2019re up to date with the industry\u2019s market-related salary.\n\nAlso, understanding market-related salary range based on your experience will allow you to better suggest a range; so instead of mentioning a set amount, mention an amount ranging between numbers based on the knowledge and experience you\u2019ve gained over the years.\n\n4. Why did you leave your last job?\n\nThis question can be tough to answer because if you left on acrimonious terms, it can be hard not to be bitter towards your previous employer (and the temptation will be strong to paint that company in a negative light). On the other hand, it becomes even trickier when the reason you left was because you were fired.\n\nWith the former, whatever you do, avoid bad-mouthing your previous employers. Instead turn the conversation around and focus on the future by stating how the position that you\u2019re applying for aligns with your career goals and challenges that you\u2019ve been passionate about for a long time.\n\nThe latter scenario is much trickier, but your best bet is to be honest. Turn your experience around and talk about what you\u2019ve learnt \u2013 by showing that you\u2019re taking accountability for your role in being fired.\n\nAccording to Alison Doyle from thebalancecareers.com, the hiring manager is actually just keen to see how you\u2019ve responded in the face of an unfortunate situation, so use the opportunity to not only explain what you\u2019ve learnt from the situation, but talk about steps you\u2019ve taken that has helped you to grow.\n\n5. Do you have any questions you\u2019d like to ask us?\n\nThis question is not only the chance for you to show prospective employers that you\u2019ve researched the company, but you can also use this as an opportunity to suss out what it\u2019s like to work there.\n\nThink beyond asking about work hours. Focus on questions about what the company\u2019s doing to grow within the market and to encourage growth amongst employees.\n\nAsk about the work culture and what the company is doing to move forward. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask about the challenges the company\u2019s facing, since according to Pamela Skillings from Biginterview.com, it could help you determine how your skills could help\n\nin specific and targeted areas. It\u2019s also smart to get an idea of your potential employer\u2019s expectations for the first three months of the job \u2013 day to day responsibilities will give you an indication as to whether or not the role is actually suited for you.\n\nTammy February", "description": "They seem like they should be a walk in the park, but these five common questions could be a minefield if not prepared for properly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7543/65c9d78e3fe64b2aaa841d2483c78f3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
