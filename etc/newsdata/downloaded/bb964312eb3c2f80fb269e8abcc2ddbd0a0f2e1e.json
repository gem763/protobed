So, they\u2019re no strangers to a bit of luxury.\n\nBut what are you getting for your \u00a360,000 investment?\n\nDesigner, Christopher Shellis, believes that the unique Fleur-de-Lys design which is made from solid platinum and 18 carat gold studs and encrusted with 60 diamonds, is worth every penny, as an heirloom.\n\nThe unisex belt, which weighs 300 grams and is 30mm thick, is intended as formal wear and can be ordered in any size.\n\nThe belt weighs 300 grams (Picture: House of Borgezie / SWNS)\n\nChris, 53, said: \u2018The Fleur-de-Lys is an inspiration of mine. It first appeared over 2,000 years ago but no one knows exactly where it came from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s always been associated with power and royalty. It is all over Westminster Cathedral and the gates of Buckingham Palace.\n\n\u2018It became popular around the time of Elizabeth I\u2019s coronation in 1558.\n\n\u2018I love the gallantry and style of that era which was a golden age for courtiers like Sir Walter Raleigh competing for the attention of the Queen.\u2019\n\nThe design process and took three days, and so far only one has been made. Chris \u2013 who began his career as a diamond setter in Birmingham\u2019s jewellery quarter \u2013 will make more if there are more orders, which he believes there will be once word gets out.\n\nChris began his career as a diamond setter (Picture: House of Borgezie / SWNS)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s easier to sell a Ferrari than a family saloon car because there are always people who don\u2019t think about the cost and buy something because they like it,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018They spend \u00a320,000 on a bottle for wine so \u00a360,000 on a belt isn\u2019t much for them. It is so special and the diamonds are of perfect clarity. For 5.5 carat diamonds it is not that overpriced.\n\n\u2018My main market is in Europe in Italy, Austria and Switzerland and prestigious parts of the continent like the Cote d\u2019Azur. I also have quite a few clients in the states.\u2019\n\nAlong with this eye-wateringly expensive version, he\u2019s also designed a solid silver one that\u2019s somewhat more accessible at \u00a3800.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris still thinks that those with the means to fork out \u00a360,000 for the gold and platinum version due to its durability.\n\nHe said: \u2018The gold and platinum belt will last forever and could be handed down for generations.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like the gold in Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb and impervious to the elements. It would be as good as new if it was dug up in 10,000 years.\u2019\n\nQuite a long time to wait for a return on the investment, but whatever floats your boat.\n\nMORE: An easy guide to non-sexy Halloween costumes\n\nMORE: Asda is selling an advent calendar filled with mini bottles of Baileys for \u00a320\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "This belt costs tens of thousands of pounds and is made from precious metals.
