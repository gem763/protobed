Simpson in Public\n\nKim Kardashian West is opening up about the last time she came face to face with O.J. Simpson.\n\nIn a recent interview on her close friend Jonathan Cheban\u2018s new podcast, FoodGod: OMFG, Kim, 38, was surprised to learn that Cheban recently ran into the ex-NFL star at a restaurant in Miami.\n\n\u201cHe knew me and then he asked \u2026 he was in the back room, and the guy felt like a charmer, it\u2019s so crazy,\u201d said Cheban, 45. \u201cI know whatever happened or whatever, he\u2019s such a charming person just the way he speaks and stuff. And like the first thing he asked was about you guys, like, \u2018How are the girls? How is everybody?'\u201d\n\nThe reality star explained to Cheban the last time she saw Simpson, which she recalled as an \u201cemotional\u201d moment.\n\n\u201cI think the last time I saw him was in Miami,\u201d Kim explained. \u201cIt was before he had gone to jail last situation, and Khlo\u00e9 and, I think me Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 were in Miami in a club, and we ran into him in the VIP section. But it was like behind a stage or something, I don\u2019t even know what club it was at. We all, I think, started crying. It was emotional, I think.\u201d\n\nView photos Stefanie Keenan/Getty; Ethan Miller/Getty More\n\nRELATED: O.J.

In 2008, he was convicted for his role in the armed robbery and kidnapping of two sports memorabilia dealers in Las Vegas. He was released from prison in 2017 after serving nine years.\n\nSimpson\u2019s case has since been widely publicized in television, including FX\u2019s award-winning series, American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson.\n\n\u201cI just watched the whole O.J., I missed the whole thing, and I just watched it, and I can\u2019t believe your dad was such a big part of it, it was crazy,\u201d said Cheban. \u201cI never met your dad and for me to see that, and my connection to you, like I watched the O.J. trial, and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t meet him. Because of him, and there\u2019s you, and then there\u2019s like me, and it\u2019s like a weird\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys would have gotten along so well,\u201d said Kim of her father, who died in 2003 at age 59 from esophageal cancer.\n\nView photos Robert Kardashian, OJ Simpson | VINCE BUCCI/AFP/Getty More", "description": "Kim Kardashian 'Started Crying' the Last Time She Saw Saw O.J.
