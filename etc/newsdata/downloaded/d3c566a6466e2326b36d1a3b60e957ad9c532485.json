Komeil Soheili/Business Insider\n\nJayeon, a real-estate employee in Seoul, and seven of her high school friends just canceled their flight to Japan despite having booked their hotels and planned their trip for about a year.\n\nThe group of 60-somethings had been hoping to celebrate their reunion in Japan, but felt they had to stand up to Japan and support the growing protest movement.\n\nTo Jayeon, Japan is a country that's opting to harm South Korea's economy instead of apologizing for its colonial history. She and her friends will now travel within South Korea instead.\n\n\"Of course we love many things of Japan, and that's why we wanted to travel there together with my best friends. Japanese food, anime, comic books, movies, and music were around us since childhood,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nA sign outside a ramen shop in Seoul, which says in black: \"100% pure Korean original corporation.\" The words in red say: \"Don't worry, there is no loyalty or extra fee to Japan at all. Nothing goes to Japan!\" Komeil Soheili/Business Insider\n\nBut all these cultural influences weren't enough to stop her from joining the anti-Japan movement.\n\n\"As a Korean, I feel responsible for how people of my country think and decide. Japan has so many good things and we appreciate it, but we want a sincere apology for what they did with our women during the Second World War,\" referring to the thousands of Korean sex slaves that Japanese soldiers used during wartime.\n\n\"If they won't accept their mistake and simply being sorry for that, how we can be sure that it will never happen again in the future? Now they even made another step forward and started a trade war against us. We are simple citizens, but canceling our travel to Japan and boycotting their products are the least we can do for now.\"\n\nAn anti-Japan protest in Seoul. Komeil Soheili/Business Insider\n\nJayeon knows that canceling a single trip won't change much, but if more and more people join the protest, they'll be able to send a message to Japan, she told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a small fee we can give for our country,\" she said, referring to the fee for canceling her flights to Japan.\n\nAn anti-Japan protest in Seoul. Komeil Soheili/Business Insider\n\nShe, like all her friends, have also decided to stop buying anything Japanese until their governments resolve their conflict.\n\n\"We haven't forgotten the sad history of our country and what Japanese did to us,\" she told Business Insider. \"The fire was under ashes since World War II and sooner or later Japan should have faced it.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I wasn't that sure at the beginning,\" she said, referring to her boycott of Japanese goods. \"But my friends convince me that it's better we do something and not our government.\"\n\n\"We can live with Korean products as well,\" she added. \"There are so many options; we just should choose other products. Sometimes we need to make a big change by doing small things.\"\n\nAn anti-Japanese sign outside a traditional house in Bukchon Hanok Village, a Korean traditional village in Seoul. The Korean words read: \"No entry for visitors.\" Komeil Soheili/Business Insider\n\nNo to Japanese holidays, beers, or movies\n\nJayeon is one of many thousands of Koreans around the country who have been boycotting all things Japanese since July. As both nations' governments refuse to back down in trade war, neither are South Koreans.\n\nAnti-Japan slogans and banners can be found almost anywhere in South Korea. Many organizations display banners that say \"NO Japan\" in front of their doors.\n\nConvenience stores don't sell Japanese beers anymore, with South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper reporting that sales of Japanese beer between July 1 and 18 were 30% lower year on year.\n\nSome 447,000 Koreans boarded Japan-bound flights from August 1 to 9 this year, down 17.9% over the same period last year, The Korean Herald newspaper reported, citing government data.\n\nJapanese stores are also empty, with The Korean Herald citing two women near Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, as looking into the display window of Japan's Uniqlo clothing store and walking away, saying: \"Yes, they are pretty, but we should not buy anything here.\"\n\nRead more: South Korea and Japan are having their own trade war, and it's gotten so bad that some South Korean gas stations are refusing to refuel Japanese-made cars\n\n\n\nA sign at a convenience store in Seoul listing the countries of origin of the beers on sale.

Komeil Soheili/Business Insider\n\nNot all South Koreans support the movement\n\nIn Jeju, one of the closest South Korean cities to Japan, signs of the anti-Japan movement were almost everywhere, particularly around its City Hall.\n\nBut not all South Koreans support the boycott-Japan movement.\n\nMinkyeong, a high-school art teacher in Jeju, told Business Insider that while she isn't happy with Japan's actions, boycotting its goods and services will only harm South Korea more.\n\n\"I totally understand why my friends decided to boycott Japan, but I can't agree with them,\" she told Business Insider, adding that she is the only one who feels so in her friend group. \"Even though personally I want to do something in support of the suffering of our contemporary history, boycotting can't be a wise idea in the long term.\"\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-In at the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28, 2019.

We are such a small country and can easily be a playground for other powers,\" she added. \"I hope people see things more wisely and not [be] affected by social media trends easily.\"\n\n\"We built up our country from the ashes of war to one of the leading economic powers of the world,\" she said. \"This couldn't happen if we made our neighbor country as an enemy. We already have one in the north and that's really more than enough!\"", "description": "South Korea and Japan are in the middle of an unrelenting trade war that is also", "authors": ["Komeil Soheili"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8dd6452e22af135e2cd99b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
