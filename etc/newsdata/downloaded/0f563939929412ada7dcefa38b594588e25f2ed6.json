The Spurs had an even better than net rating than the Warriors that season. And the eventual-champion Cavaliers loomed with LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.\n\nOklahoma City beat San Antonio in the second round then blew a 3-1 lead to Golden State in the Western Conference finals. (The Warriors then blew their own 3-1 lead to Cleveland in the NBA Finals.)\n\nWhere does that loss to the Warriors rank among the hardest to deal with in Durant\u2019s career?\n\nDurant on Hot 97:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t rank in the top five.\n\nWe lost Game 2 at home in 2012 to Miami. That was a tough loss. We lost Game 5 against Memphis at home. It was a 2-2 series. They went up 3-2. Those are tough losses to me. I really, really, really felt like we had an opportunity. We had some momentum. We\u2019re playing against 73-win team in the Warriors and the Spurs, who were a 67-win team that year. And then the Cavs were the best team in the league, most-talented team. So, I\u2019m like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an uphill climb. Let\u2019s just see what we can do.\u201d But these other seasons, I felt like\u2026\n\n\u201cYou actually had it?\u201d a host asked.\n\nDurant:\n\nYeah.\n\nDurant named two other losses, not five. Not top-five might have been hyperbole.\n\nBut he\u2019s clearly downplaying the significance of the Golden State loss to him.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s how he feels. I can\u2019t know exactly how he feels, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t tell him how should feel. He has indicated how much faith he was losing in the Thunder. Maybe he truly didn\u2019t get his hopes up high enough in 2016 to feel burned by blowing that lead.\n\nThis seems dubious, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe young Thunder might have believed they would win the 2012 NBA Finals against the Heat, but Oklahoma City still appeared destined for a dynasty after that loss.\n\nYes, the Thunder lost Game 5 to the Grizzlies in the 2014 first round. But Oklahoma City rallied to win the series in seven. How badly could that loss have stung? Not enough to undermine a comeback.\n\nThe 2016 Thunder reached an incredibly high level against Golden State. Their length and athleticism tormented the Warriors, and Oklahoma City also brought plenty of skill. Golden State really had to elevate its own play to win three straight. Those Thunder looked like a championship-caliber team to me \u2013 though maybe not to Durant.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Durant is retconning an explanation for his 2016 free agency. He received immense criticism for leaving for the team that just beat him. Downplaying the personal significance of that series could be an attempt to change the narrative.\n\nSo, maybe this explains why Durant signed with the Warriors.\n\nOr maybe it shows more about how Durant wants to frame that decision after the fact.", "description": "How could Kevin Durant leave the Thunder for the Warriors, who had just beaten Oklahoma City in the playoffs?", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rRzy0BnYaGOlAE5EvPDW_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kcrHpFTdM36JstYUGhxOJQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/b273c918816b1aad287d32c2cf32f2c4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
