He helped drag his side from 122-8 Getty\n\nA jury in Southwark coroner\u2019s court has now found after a 12-day hearing that the probation service failed to make sure his ex-partner Ms Breha was notified of his violent past.\n\nThe jury reached the conclusion that Alex\u2019s death was partly caused by key changes to the probation service implemented under former justice secretary Chris Grayling in 2014 \u2013 saying his overhaul caused higher workloads which \u201cmay have affected the effectiveness of the system to deal with high-risk offenders\u201d.\n\nIt also found the service was understaffed and failed to properly share information across different agencies \u2013 as well as incorrectly classifying Iheanacho.\n\nThe probation service admitted Iheanacho, who was convicted of Alex\u2019s murder in 2017, was incorrectly classified before being released from jail \u2013 with the jury concluding this failing partly contributed to the death of the five-year-old boy.\n\nSelen Cavcav, senior case worker at charity Inquest, said: \u201cThe critical conclusion of the jury once again exposes the consequences of the rushed and ill-informed \u2018transformation\u2019 of probation services. Multiple opportunities to protect Liliya and Alex were missed, as their safety was put in the hands of inexperienced individuals working in overstretched services. This inquest has performed a vital function in publicly scrutinising these systemic failings, which must urgently be addressed at a national level.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Alex was my heartbeat and I miss him so much. He should be here right now going to school, playing with his friends.\n\n\u201cSomeone took this away from him for no reason and the systems meant to protect us did not. I now hope changes will be made. I would also like to thank everyone who has been supporting and helping me during this horrible time.\u201d\n\nAlex was provided with emergency treatment after the attack but died from head and stomach injuries in hospital two days later.\n\nHarriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, said: \u201cThis case highlights just how important it is for all those working in the criminal justice system, from police through to probation, to have a proper understanding of the dynamics and risks of domestic violence and coercive and controlling behaviour. With the necessary insight and proper resourcing, this tragic death like many other domestic homicides could have been averted.\u201d\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cOur deepest condolences remain with the victim\u2019s family, and we apologise unreservedly for the unacceptable failings in this case \u2013 we will now carefully consider the coroner\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cIn the three years since Alex\u2019s tragic death, the National Probation Service in London has undertaken a huge programme of work to improve standards and better protect the public. Over 1,300 probation staff in London have attended specialist domestic violence and child safeguarding training and we have recruited a further 180 trainee probation officers over the last year.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSystemic failings\u201d on the part of\u00a0the probation service led to the \u201cunlawful killing\u201d of a five-year-old boy by his mother\u2019s former boyfriend, an inquest has ruled.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/06/18/alex-malcolm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
