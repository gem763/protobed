Here are five keys for Washington if it is to have a chance at pulling an upset over the Vikings:\n\nKeep Kirk Cousins from having a huge game\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhatever anyone wants to say about Cousins\u2019s inconsistency, he has been on a tremendous run lately, throwing for over 300 yards in each of the past three games \u2014 all Vikings wins \u2014 with 10 touchdowns against only one interception. Minnesota refrained from throwing much during early-season wins over Atlanta and Oakland, but rebounded from some of those early struggles and will likely let Cousins pass a lot against his old team.\n\nGiven the Redskins\u2019 inability to generate a consistent pass rush and their penchant for lapses in coverage, Cousins could have another huge night. Washington\u2019s best chance is to get enough pressure on Cousins to force the mistakes he can sometimes make. His leading receiver, Adam Thielen, will miss the game with a hamstring injury.\n\nFind a receiver other than Terry McLaurin\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rookie wide receiver from Ohio State has 419 yards and five touchdowns this season. No other pass-catcher on the team has even come close. With tight end Jordan Reed on injured reserve and two other key weapons \u2014 tight end Vernon Davis and Chris Thompson \u2014 ruled out, the other receivers have to do more. In some ways this is on Keenum to find them, but Trey Quinn, Paul Richardson, Kelvin Harmon and Steven Sims need to step up.\n\nSims was effective running the ball early this season but teams seem prepared for it. He and Harmon have combined for 14 catches this season, and the Redskins were hoping for more.\n\nRun the ball\n\nPeterson has an ankle sprain and is listed as questionable, but he is highly determined to play in this game against his former team. Interim Coach Bill Callahan wants to commit to the run, which means Peterson will get lots of early opportunities, as will Wendell Smallwood, who likely fills Thompson\u2019s role again this week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRunning against the Vikings will be tough, however. Minnesota Coach Mike Zimmer\u2019s defense has done a solid job of shutting down opposing running games, allowing just 630 rushing yards this season. Given the state of Washington\u2019s offense these days, running the ball is still the Redskins\u2019 best hope for winning.\n\nEliminate mistakes\n\nEvery week the Redskins promise to clean up the drive-killing holding penalties and backbreaking coverage breakdowns on defense, and then every week they do the same things. After playing nearly penalty-free against Miami, Washington had several penalties on the offensive line that probably kept it from scoring at least one touchdown against the 49ers.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the offensive line from the past couple of weeks should play on Thursday, the Redskins have two starters in the secondary listed as questionable in Josh Norman and Montae Nicholson. That could mean more young and new players will be on the field, which makes it more likely a coverage will be blown.\n\nAD\n\nBlock out the noise\n\nThe Redskins should be accustomed to playing without the backing of a raucous home crowd, given the number of opposing fans who have come to FedEx Field this season. But Thursday\u2019s game marks the first time this year that they will play in a really loud opposing stadium. With U.S. Bank Stadium enclosed and the stands expected to be filled, Washington will have a hard time hearing. If they struggle with communication and don\u2019t stay focused, the game could quickly get away from them.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Limiting Kirk Cousins and Minnesota's passing game will be critical for Washington on Thursday night.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1-KYcDVNLxGhBsGAaWPaGt90PfY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4HOLYEHTVEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
