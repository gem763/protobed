He said three of the train\u2019s carriages had come off the tracks.\n\nMbikayi later told Reuters the ministry was aware of the contradictory death tolls and was trying to establish the exact number.\n\nDeadly transport accidents are common in Democratic Republic of Congo due to poor infrastructure and lack of regulation.\n\nThe national railway company confirmed an accident had taken place. Hubert Tshiakama, the company\u2019s head of operations, said the untouched front carriages of the train were once again on their way to the town of Kalemie.\n\n\u201cFor now, we cannot determine the causes of the accident,\u201d he said.", "description": "Up to 50 people were killed when a cargo train derailed in Congo's southeastern province of Tanganyika in the early hours of Thursday, government officials said, though reports on casualties differed widely.", "authors": ["Fiston Mahamba", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
