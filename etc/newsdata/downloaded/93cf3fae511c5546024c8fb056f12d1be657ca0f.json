The official on Saturday confirmed the schedule on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. NBC News first reported Sondland\u2019s planned appearance Saturday.\n\n[How a wealthy hotelier turned ambassador became the latest key player in the Ukraine inquiry]\n\nAt a news conference with the foreign minister of Greece, Pompeo said he had sent a letter to Capitol Hill as \u201cour initial response to the document request. We\u2019ll obviously do all the things we\u2019re required to do by law.\u201d\n\nHis remarks came as Democratic-led House committees leading the impeachment investigation said that he failed to meet a Friday deadline to deliver subpoenaed State Department documents to them. \u201cHowever, the State Department has contacted the committees on this matter, and we hope the Department will cooperate in full promptly,\u201d a committee official said.\n\nPompeo repeated charges made a week ago that the congressional inquiries have \u201charassed and abused State Department employees\u201d by contacting them directly and failing to go through proper channels to request both testimony and documents.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo delivers a speech Saturday at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens. (Costas Baltas/AP)\n\n\u201cI remember once, when I was on that side and we were looking for documents, I remember precisely how long it took for those documents to come across,\u201d said Pompeo, a former House member from Kansas who, while in the majority, helped lead the Republican investigation of the Clinton-led State Departments actions in Benghazi, Libya regarding a 2012 terrorist attack that killed four American officials.\n\nPompeo, who has been on a week-long trip to southern Europe, has been relatively closed-lipped about the impeachment inquiry unfolding in Washington, dismissing questions about it as political gamesmanship and a \u201csilly gotcha game.\u201d He is due to return to Washington Sunday.\n\nRegarding pressure on Ukraine to investigate activities there of Biden and his son, who served on the board of a major Ukrainian energy company, and Trump\u2019s public invitation this week for China to help investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities there, Pompeo defended the president.\n\nHe also it was \u201cvery reasonable\u201d and \u201cour duty\u201d to ask other governments to help investigate interference in the 2016 U.S. election, as Trump has. \u201cThere\u2019s been some suggestion somehow that it would be inappropriate for the United States government to engage in that activity, and I see it as just precisely the opposite, Pompeo said. \u201cI see our duty to engage in activity that ensures that we have fair, free elections.\u201d\n\n[How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm]\n\n\n\nGordon Sondland is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. (Daniel Mihailescu/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nAsked later whether other countries, including Greece, could come under pressure based on their willingness to help the U.S. president, Pompeo laughed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally appropriate, right, isn\u2019t that right? Yes, it\u2019s totally right. . . . Nations do this, nations work together and they say \u2018Boy, goodness gracious, if you can help me with \u201cX\u201d and we\u2019ll help you achieve \u201cY\u201d.\u2019 This is what partnerships do. It\u2019s win-win. It\u2019s better for each of us.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s complaint revealed a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son and subsequent efforts to restrict access to records of the call. It also alleged that Trump asked Zelensky to look into unproven allegations that Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine.\n\nTrump again maligned the whistleblower, Democrats and the news media in tweets Saturday morning, baselessly calling the New York Times and The Washington Post \u201cpure fiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe so-called Whistleblower\u2019s account of my perfect phone call is \u201cway off,\u201d not even close. (Rep. Adam) Schiff and (Speaker Nancy) Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!\u201d Trump also tweeted.\n\n[Trump takes vulgar swipe at Romney after senator criticizes president\u2019s China, Ukraine appeals]\n\nAs part of their investigation, the committees subpoenaed the White House for documents on Friday, a step they had announced earlier in the week, and demanded documents from Vice President Pence.\n\n\u201cDuring a press conference on Wednesday, President Trump was asked if he would cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. He responded, \u2018I always cooperate.\u2019 President Trump\u2019s claim is patently false,\u201d the three committee chairmen wrote. \u201cThe White House has refused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 multiple requests for documents from our Committees on a voluntary basis. After nearly a month of stonewalling, it appears clear that the President has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up.\u201d\n\nThe three are Intelligence Committee Chairmen Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and Oversight and Reform Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.).\n\nSondland, who will give his deposition next week, worked behind the scenes to carry out Trump\u2019s wishes in a country that\u2019s not part of the European Union. The ambassador met with Zelensky to give \u201cadvice\u201d about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands, the whistleblower reported. And in text messages turned over to House investigators Thursday, Sondland insisted that Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was not a quid pro quo \u2014 as diplomat William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor had feared, according to the texts.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland wrote last month, before urging Taylor, the U.S. charges d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, to call him instead.\n\n[Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders have long worried aides, leaving some \u2018genuinely horrified\u2019]\n\nKurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, spent some 10 hours behind closed doors on Thursday with the committees, providing a deposition and text messages.\n\nUnlike Volker, who turned all his communications over to Congress, Sondland transmitted his texts and documents to the State Department, which means the committees will have to fight the agency for access to them.\n\nGreg Miller contributed to this story.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "U.S. ambassador to European Union, Gordon Sondland, will give deposition to House panels next week.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eyfxw48cEKkBPymn-gpQ7WUiso0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QFZOT6HHS4I6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
