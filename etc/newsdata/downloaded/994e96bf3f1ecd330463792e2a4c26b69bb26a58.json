They say those claims included inflated costs for services, billing for patients who hadn't been medically diagnosed and case management services for patients working out at Sheridan's gym.\n\nAuthorities want Sheridan to forfeit $3 million, properties he owns in several Ohio counties and replica movie vehicles.\n\nA message seeking comment was left Saturday with Sheridan's attorney.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
