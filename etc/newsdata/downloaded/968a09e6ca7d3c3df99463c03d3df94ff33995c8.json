Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq, swiftly condemned the remark as \u201cbeyond repugnant,\u201d noting that he has seen firsthand \u201cnations ravaged by civil war.\u201d\n\nFrustrated by the whistleblower complaint that fueled the impeachment inquiry, Trump has also taken aim at House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nOn Monday, Trump suggested Schiff should be arrested for treason for his gangster-style portrayal of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the July 25 call, Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky for help with an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter based on unsubstantiated corruption allegations. A summary of the call shows Trump had spoken about U.S. military aid to Ukraine just before making his request for an investigation of his 2020 political rival.\n\nOpening a hearing last week with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, Schiff parodied the conversation as a shakedown, repeating its contents in exaggerated terms to make his point, which drew ire from Trump.\n\nTrump also implied last week that anyone who gave information to the whistleblower is guilty of treason and should be executed, claiming they are \u201cclose to\u201d being spies, according to The New York Times.\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson had determined that the whistleblower complaint \u2015 which accuses Trump of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\u201d \u2015 was credible.", "description": "The White House trade adviser accuses Democrats of searching for a crime they could try to pin on Trump.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93c4c92100006901513813.jpeg?cache=tahttrk5mp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
