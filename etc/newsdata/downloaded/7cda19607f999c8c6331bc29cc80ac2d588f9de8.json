The latest session Wednesday was with Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A previous witness, Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, appeared Wednesday to review the transcript from his session Oct. 3.\n\nRepublicans have complained that the meetings should be public and transcripts should be released. Access has been limited to members of the three panels, which prevented one Republican from attending Monday and the half-dozen Wednesday. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said private sessions are needed to prevent witnesses from hearing each other, the same protocol used by prosecutors in criminal investigations.\n\nLeading the confrontation was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who called Schiff a liar and a partisan leading a witch hunt \u2013 language that echoes Trump\u2019s terminology. McCarthy cited Schiff\u2019s opening statement Sept. 26 in a public hearing with the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, which characterized Trump\u2019s phone call to his Ukrainian counterpart July 25 as a mafia shakedown.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even go down there and read the transcript,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., says Democrats have prevented him from accessing transcripts from the impeachment inquiry. More\n\nMcCarthy alleged that Republicans have not been allowed to cross-examine the witnesses, which is not accurate. Staff attorneys led the questioning, and the time was evenly divided between Democratic and Republican aides.\n\n\u201cThey designed a process to pick and choose who to come,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis is a closed system. This is a system designed to already try to find an outcome.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation Wednesday followed a similar incident Monday, when Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a member of the Judiciary Committee, was blocked from attending the private deposition with Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Asia.\n\nSchiff said Tuesday that transcripts would be released and public hearings held. But he said it was important not to have witnesses hear each other\u2019s testimony \u201ceither to hide the truth or color the truth or know just how much they can give and how much they can conceal.\u201d\n\nSchiff noted that the special counsel or independent counsel investigations of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were held behind closed doors before public hearings. The committees conduct their own inquiry, for lack of a Justice Department investigation. Schiff said all members of the three committees have been allowed to attend the depositions.\n\n\u201cThey have been very professionally done,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAll those members, too, asked questions. And we go until the questions are exhausted, so they get to ask whatever questions they want in a process in which they have every bit as much opportunity as the majority to ask questions.\u201d\n\nSchiff said the committees keep the sessions closed because some witnesses may lie like Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, who was convicted of lying to Congress.\n\n\u201cNow, we do anticipate a time when we'll be releasing transcripts, and we do anticipate there will be a time when we will hold back some of these witnesses for open session, and we may call witnesses in open session that we haven't called in closed session. But we will do so giving the GOP members every opportunity to ask questions,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we get to the truth, and this is the process, I think, early in an investigation that makes the most sense.\u201d", "description": "A half-dozen House Republicans complained Wednesday about limited access to depositions and transcripts in the Trump impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HptwonU5p3nT.ibppeOvbw--~B/aD0zMjIxO3c9NDQ5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/63abf9fc493416e37cbc1c26f06425b8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
