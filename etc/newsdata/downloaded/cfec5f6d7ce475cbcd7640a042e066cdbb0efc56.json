This is a top-secret-level computer network that is the main platform the aides use to do their jobs. It connects with a top-secret network called JWICS, which is more widely used elsewhere in the executive branch.\n\nTNet has access controls and auditing safeguards. For example, it keeps track of who created or uploaded files, who looked at them, who modified them and how and who printed them out. When officials create a \u201cpackage\u201d \u2014 essentially, a new file \u2014 in TNet, they can set controls so any colleague who works on a particular subject, like European affairs or counterterrorism, has access.\n\nWhat goes in TNet?\n\nOfficials can store any file that is classified to the top-secret level \u2014 the highest classification \u2014 so long as it is not \u201ccode word,\u201d a term referring to a specialized category of even more delicate top-secret information that officials are permitted to know about only if they have been granted specific access to it.\n\nOfficials with a general top-secret security clearance will not be given code-word clearance to learn about covert activities unrelated to their work. For example, an aide working on North Korea policy would not have been told about planning for the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan. Similarly, files containing intelligence supporting the planned raid were not stored in the ordinary TNet system.\n\nWhere does the National Security Council store its more sensitive files?\n\nThe council also has an even more locked-down system called NICE, for NSC Intelligence Collaboration Environment. NICE appears to be what the whistleblower was referring to as a \u201cstand alone\u201d computer system managed by the council\u2019s directorate for intelligence programs. One former official said it was better understood as a subdomain of TNet.\n\nForeign policy aides typically use NICE to develop and store documents related to code-word programs. For example, staff members working on a covert activity might use NICE to draft a presidential finding or decision memo about it. When they are done, they would print a copy for the president to sign.\n\nWhy store secrets in NICE?\n\nIt significantly reduces the number of people who can gain access to it. About only 20% of National Security Council staff members are NICE users, one former official said. They can log into the system from their work computers using virtual private network software that limits each of them to using that particular workstation.\n\nWhen NICE users create or upload a new file, they can give only other individual NICE users access to it by name; unlike in TNet, they cannot invite entire groups, the former official said.\n\nIs it an \u201cabuse\u201d to use the NICE system to store a file that is not top-secret code word?\n\nUsing the NICE system to curtail access to the record of Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, may very well be, as the whistleblower also wrote, a sign \u201cthat White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d But calling it an \u201cabuse\u201d appears to be subjective.\n\nGenerally, the national security adviser can decide who can see what files. No rule prohibits putting a file with a lower-level classification into the NICE system in order to take advantage of its greater access restrictions, a former official said.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The whistleblower who revealed President Donald Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine's leader to open investigations that could benefit him politically also accused White House officials of essentially hiding a rough record of the conversation by placing it in the same highly restricted", "authors": ["Charlie Savage", "Matthew Rosenberg", "Adam Goldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HfWjqUy5wRnZqa0fJGzVcQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-309416-1569971959257.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
