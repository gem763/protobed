FCA\u2019s Alfa Romeo (FCHA.MI) registrations rose 25.9% year on year.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nissan (7201.T) was one of the biggest losers among major brands, with a 7.0% decline in sales.\n\nAmong premium auto brands, Audi (NSUG.DE) sales rose 38.8%, topping competitors such as Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) and Volvo, which saw their registrations rise 9.9% and 9.3%, respectively.
