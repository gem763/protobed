An important one, too. One that could\u2014and should\u2014change the way denizens use Market Street, San Francisco\u2019s busiest artery.\n\nToday, the SF Municipal Transportation Agency board of directors will vote on the $604-million Better Market Street Project, a proposal set to transform Market Street between Octavia Boulevard and the Embarcadero\u2014most notably, restricting private vehicles between Steuart and Gough.\n\nUnder the current proposal, Muni buses, emergency vehicles, paratransit, bikes, and legit taxis would still be allowed to ride this stretch of Market Street, but personal cars would be barred from driving along Market Street.\n\nUber and Lyft ride-hailing cars would also be verboten, but would be allowed to drop passengers off at cross streets. The current plan includes the addition of over 40 new white passenger loading zones and more than 200 yellow commercial loading zones on side streets near Market.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this plan wouldn\u2019t simply turn Market Street into one giant bike lane; the city\u2019s main thoroughfare would also become a safe space for pedestrians, a group that has seen an uptick in fatal collisions this year.\n\nThe Better Market Street Project, an idea that would have seemed heretical 30 years ago, has backing from a number of city agencies, elected officials, and Mayor London Breed, who, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, endorsed the project Monday.\n\n\u201cAfter a lengthy public planning process that included hundreds of outreach meetings and conversations with stakeholders, the city has developed a design that will support Vision Zero safety goals, improve transit and transform Market Street for our next generation,\u201d the mayor said in a letter to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency board.\n\nIn addition to altering the street, the audacious project could help mollify the blighted stretch of Mid-Market, a problem that Twitter, luxe apartments, and chef-driven eateries haven\u2019t managed to cure.\n\nThe Better Streets Project notes that, if approved, construction for phase one could start as soon as 2020, pending approvals. \u201cOnce a preferred design is chosen, the city will work with the community members and businesses to ensure the least impact possible during construction.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what it might look like:\n\nCurbed SF will update after the voting results are announced.", "description": "$604-million project would turn San Francisco\u2019s main thoroughfare into a safer space for everyone.", "authors": ["Brock Keeling", "Adam Brinklow", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJZIpS0flx2-XkeQF_ZEXPXVzCs=/0x125:2800x1591/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19290403/shutterstock_1159843612.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
