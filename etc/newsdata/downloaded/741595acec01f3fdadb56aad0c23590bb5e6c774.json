I\u2019m so impacted, I feel like the world is going to change because you\u2019re not going to put your ass on a rubber seat and drink water,\u201d Frankel said of the almost cult-like obsession attributed to many Soul Cycle fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankel also took the opportunity to give an update on her charity work for hurricane victims. \u201cI\u2019ve raised millions of dollars in relief efforts, and I\u2019ve really cared about each thing and it\u2019s been contagious and addictive for other people to care about each thing so deeply.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never knew a thing about relief work and literally did two [of the] largest private relief efforts in US history based on just being passionate and getting things done and connecting with other people and asking for help,\u201d Frankel said.\n\nIn addition to her Housewives work, Frankel is best known for her diet booze company Skinnygirl created in 2011. She reportedly unloaded half of the cocktail company to Fortune Brands' Beam Global for an estimated $100 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Bethenny Frankel calls out fickle Soul Cycle boycotters.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/bethenny-frankel-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
