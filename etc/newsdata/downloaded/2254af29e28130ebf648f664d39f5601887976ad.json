The bill, AB 1215 , marks the latest legislative effort to limit adoption of facial-recognition technology, which critics maintain raises privacy and accuracy concerns. Now the bill, also referred to as the Body Camera Accountability Act, heads to Governor Gavin Newsom, who must decide whether or not to sign it into law by October 13. Ifhe does, it will go into effect in January.\n\nA Los Angeles police officer wears an Axon body camera in 2017.

It also prohibits police from taking body-camera footage and running it through facial-recognition software at a later time. It does not prevent state and local police from using facial-recognition technology in other ways, such as in stationary cameras, and it does not apply to federal agencies such as the FBI.\n\nThe bill will last for three years. It was originally proposed with no end, but was amended by the state senate and agreed to on Thursday by the Assembly.\n\nFacial recognition software has become increasingly popular in the past several years, used at stores, concert venues, airports, and by some police departments. The technology identifies people from live or recorded video or still photos, typically by comparing their facial features with those in a database of faces (such as mugshots).", "description": "California lawmakers on Thursday temporarily banned state and local law enforcement from using facial-recognition software in body cameras, as the most populous US state takes action against the technology.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190813183437-los-angeles-body-cam-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
