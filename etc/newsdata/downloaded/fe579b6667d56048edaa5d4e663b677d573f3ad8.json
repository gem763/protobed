His crime was to defy Prime Minister Boris Johnson and vote in the House of Commons to try to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt feels a little bit like something one associates with other countries,\u201d Stewart told the BBC on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a passing phase in the history of the Conservative Party,\u201d he added hopefully.\n\nBut far from being a passing phase, the purge -- in which 21 MPs were stripped of the party whip -- is the latest chapter in a civil war over Europe that has dominated the party for decades. When David Cameron became party leader in 2006, he warned that voters were deterred by Tories \u201cbanging on about Europe.\u201d Now membership of the party -- in Parliament at least -- is defined by it.\n\nStewart was summarily dismissed, alongside two former chancellors of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond, and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Nicholas Soames in the biggest purge over Europe since the 1990s. Most of the rebels back Brexit in principle, but won\u2019t allow Johnson to leave without a deal.\n\nThey voted for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal with the EU and watched as Brexiteer rebels wrecked that agreement by refusing to back it in Parliament. Now many of those anti-EU rebels sit in the cabinet and the lawmakers opposed to a no-deal divorce have been thrown out.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s different here is that the caliber of MPs who have lost the whip is in stark contrast to the caliber who lost it in rebellions over Europe in the 1990s,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, referring to John Major\u2019s action against rebels over their opposition to the Maastricht Treaty. \u201cThere are some very, very big beasts who have lost the whip.\u201d\n\nRuth Davidson, who was credited with reviving the party\u2019s fortunes in Scotland before her resignation last week, tweeted her support for ensuring that the party remains a broad church. A campaigner for Remain in the EU referendum, her success north of the border was in part because she appealed beyond traditional Tory voters.\n\nAnd Clarke, who served in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet and as chancellor under Major, said he doesn\u2019t know if he can bring himself to even vote for the party under its current leader.\n\n\u201cI have to decide whether to vote Conservative if Boris Johnson is still the leader. That\u2019s my next problem,\u201d Clarke said in a TV interview on Tuesday night. \u201cI am a Conservative, of course I am. But this leader, I don\u2019t recognize this. It\u2019s the Brexit Party, re-badged.\u201d\n\nArch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg outraged MPs by lolling on the front bench of the House of Commons during Tuesday\u2019s debate and accusing MPs of \u201carrogance\u201d for trying to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOn Twitter, Labour MP Anna Turley called him, \u201cThe physical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement, disrespect and contempt for our Parliament.\u201d Earlier in the day Phillip Lee defected from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats, citing Rees-Mogg\u2019s attitude as one of his reasons.\n\nBale said the latest explosion of divisions in the party doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it faces terminal decline.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of Tory MPs voted with the government last night, so this is not the Tory party split down the middle,\u201d Bale said. \u201cThe Tory Party is the world\u2019s oldest and most successful political party, it will dust itself off and start again as it has done several times over the centuries.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Rees-Mogg starting in 11th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kitty Donaldson in London at kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny, Andrew Atkinson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Just two months ago Rory Stewart was a cabinet minister and a contender for leader of the Conservative Party.On Tuesday night he was being presented with GQ magazine\u2019s politician of the year award when he received a text message saying he\u2019d been expelled from the party.
