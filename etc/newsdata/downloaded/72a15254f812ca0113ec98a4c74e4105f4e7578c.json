They\u2019re following smaller operators, such as CitizenM, Yotel, Mama Shelter and Pod Hotels, that have played in the tiny-room sandbox for more than a decade and continue to grow. As they do, they are trying to lure customers who are sensitive to price, hungry for experiences and comfortable with tight spaces.\n\nWith rooms generally smaller (sometimes much smaller) than 200 square feet, today\u2019s microhotels are emphasizing in-demand locations and buzzy common areas while offering rooms that are described as \u201ccozy,\u201d \u201chighly efficient,\u201d \u201cfunctional\u201d and \u201cthe most fun you\u2019ll have in 14 sq m\u201d (or about 150 square feet).\n\n\u201cThe whole concept of the microhotel is trying to get the guest out of the room and into the public space,\u201d says Jing Yang, an assistant professor at New York University\u2019s Tisch Center of Hospitality, part of the School of Professional Studies.\n\n[Marriott\u2019s new millennial-aimed hotel room: Stylish, cheap and smaller than 200 square feet]\n\nTravelers have long had the option to choose minuscule accommodations, experts point out, from bunks in European hostels to capsule-size sleeping quarters in Japan. But those were typically spartan and utilitarian, with a priority on price. The new versions have loftier aspirations.\n\n\u201cWhere \u2018micro\u2019 was associated with cheap and small, today, this micro is more higher-quality experiential and kind of cool,\u201d says Jim Anhut, director of the hospitality business real estate minor at Michigan State University.\n\nAs a former hotel executive, Anhut helped launch several brands. And now he\u2019s a partner in a small venture capital firm that has invested in small-room hostel concepts. He says many modern travelers don\u2019t want to spend the money on empty space in a room.\n\n\u201cWhy do I need 300-plus square feet? I\u2019m plenty happy with 175 square feet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt allows the hotelier and brand and developer to put a lot more investment in the quality of the fixtures, the floor, the bedding. They\u2019ve accomplished the same thing in 120 square feet less.\u201d\n\nMarriott\u2019s Moxy has been on the leading edge of the recent growth. After launching in 2014, Moxy has 46 properties around the globe with 104 more in the pipeline. The brand tries to keep its rooms about 183 square feet, occasionally a bit smaller, and typically opens in dense urban downtown markets where it can (but doesn\u2019t necessarily always) offer rooms at a lower price point than competitors.\n\n\u201cThe approach certainly was to find a way to create and optimize the design of a cozy, small-but-smart guest room, but really infuse it with a design that is filled with high-end finishes and allows you to personalize it,\u201d says Toni Stoeckl, global brand leader for Moxy Hotels.\n\n\n\nA double guest room at Moxy Chattanooga Downtown. (Moxy Hotels)\n\nMuch of the furniture, like a folding table, chair and luggage rack, hangs on the wall. Research showed guests didn\u2019t want to skimp on restrooms, so the brand prioritized \u201can amazing shower experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe efficiency of how they utilize the space is actually pretty optimal,\u201d says Yang, the NYU professor. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re sacrificing a lot of space, per se, but with the engineering and interior design, they\u2019re able to pack a lot, even though usually the square footage of microhotels is half the size of a traditional hotel.\u201d\n\nAt Moxy, the front desk is no more; guests check in at the bar and get a free welcome drink.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, this guest wants to mingle with other guests and locals, so the focus on the public space has been really huge,\u201d Stoeckl says.\n\n[D.C.\u2019s first Pod hotel \u2014 seen through millennial and Gen X eyes]\n\nThat will also be the case for the new Hilton brand, Motto, which was announced a year ago. Rooms will start at about 165 square feet and be priced affordably, though rates haven\u2019t been set.\n\n\"Design the room for the guests. When you look at the lobby space, design it for the locals.\u201d Tripp McLaughlin, global head for Motto\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve said is, we\u2019ll design the room for the guests,\u201d says Tripp McLaughlin, global head for Motto. \u201cWhen you look at the lobby space, design it for the locals.\u201d\n\nThe company is telling owners the public area should have a local designer and local restaurateur, mixologist and barista to create what the space should look like so each is tied to its location.\n\nThe first property is expected to open around the end of next year or early 2021, and sites in several U.S. cities, as well as Copenhagen, Milan and Mexico City, are expected to follow. More than 10 deals are approved or in the works so far, McLaughlin said.\n\nLike at other microhotels, a location in crowded urban cores where occupancy rates are high will be key.\n\n\u201cWe can fit three Motto rooms in the same footprint as two Hampton rooms,\u201d McLaughlin says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit tiny. But what we\u2019ve heard from owners is, number one, they like it, because they couldn\u2019t make an 80-room Hampton work in the city center of D.C. because it\u2019s too expensive. But now if you\u2019re looking at a 110-room Motto, it becomes more profitable for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nA rendering of the common spaces in the new Motto by Hilton hotel. (Motto by Hilton)\n\nThe company wants Motto to cater to business and leisure travelers and plans a \u201ccasual, comfortable residential feel.\u201d To compete with alternative options, such as Airbnb, the hotels will include flexible spaces with fold-down wall beds that can adjoin standard rooms to give large groups plenty of room to spread out while staying connected.\n\nFor Mike LaRosa, who writes about co-working and travel on his Coworkaholic blog, microhotels fit the bill. He is also co-founder of a real estate development and management company that consults with hospitality companies, including Marriott, and did some work on the Moxy concept.\n\nLaRosa has stayed in Moxy hotels and no-brand capsule hotels in Japan, worked in the lobby of a CitizenM and recently napped between flights at a Yotelair \u201ccabin\u201d at London Gatwick Airport, which has \u201ccapsule rooms that are even smaller than you would imagine.\u201d\n\nAt 34, he\u2019s squarely in the millennial demographic that microhotels want to appeal to. He\u2019s looking for value. And he doesn\u2019t need all that much.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hanging out in our rooms,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have space that\u2019s designed to be productive and to connect with people, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe battle against resort fees is on.
