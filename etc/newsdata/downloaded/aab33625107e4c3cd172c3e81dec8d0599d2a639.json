We are 100% confident that two of them are alive as the officials saw them going out for food around the area of Haew Narok falls,' Nattapong said.\n\nOfficials were initially called at 3am on Saturday when a group of elephants was blocking a road by the waterfall.\n\nAn elephant is submerged beneath the churning waters at the bottom of the waterfall on Saturday\n\nThree hours later the body of a three-and-a-half year old calf was found at the base of the falls.\n\nShortly after this, another five bodies were found nearby.\n\nTwo other elephants who were stuck on a ledge and extremely distressed were rescued.\n\nEdwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said any elephants left in the herd would have difficulty surviving as the animals rely on each other for protection and finding food.\n\n'It's like losing half your family,' Mr Wiek told the BBC.\n\n'There's nothing you can do, it's nature unfortunately,' he said.\n\nTwo elephants were seen to be stuck on a ledge near to the waterfall and were thrown food by the officials to help them climb back up\n\nTwo elephants that were stuck on a ledge were rescued but were said to be extremely distressed\n\nAround 7,000 Asian elephants remain in Thailand, but around half of those living in captivity.\n\nThe death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai.\n\nThe elephant population at the park is estimated to be about 300.", "description": "Another five carcasses were spotted by a drone being used to investigate the deaths of the other elephants at Hell's Fall in Khao Yai National Park, northeastern Thailand.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19336476-0-image-a-26_1570527483325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
