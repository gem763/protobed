REUTERS/Michael Dalder/Files\n\nThe link to the website, LZPlay, surfaced about 10 days earlier on social media site reddit here\n\n\u201cThis GMS (Google Mobile Services) installer is ad-free, well-designed, and ONLY works for Huawei devices,\u201d wrote a user.\n\nLaunched two weeks earlier, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s Mate 30 phone uses an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban, but the devices do not come with pre-installed applications such as Google Maps.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration effectively blacklisted Huawei in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise national security, a charge the company denies.\n\nGoogle was among the first U.S. companies to suspend business with Huawei, hobbling the company\u2019s smartphone business outside China as the tech giant lost access to updates to Google\u2019s Android operating system.\n\nLZPlay used an undocumented \"backdoor\" in Huawei's mobile device management software to install Google software, a security researcher wrote in a blog post medium.com/@topjohnwu/huaweis-undocumented-apis-a-backdoor-to-reinstall-google-services-c3a5dd71a7cd on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it is pretty obvious that Huawei is well aware of this LZPlay app, and explicitly allows its existence,\u201d said researcher John Wu.\n\n\u201cAlthough this \u2018backdoor\u2019 requires user interaction to be enabled, the installer app, which is signed with a special certificate from Huawei, was granted privileges nowhere to be found on standard Android systems,\u201d he said.\n\nA Huawei spokeswoman denied any relationship with LZPlay.\n\n\u201cHuawei\u2019s latest Mate 30 series is not pre-installed with GMS, and Huawei has had no involvement with www.lzplay.net,\u201d she said.\n\nGoogle and Wu were not immediately available for comment.\n\nA search of internet registration records showed that LZPlay website was registered in July. (bit.ly/2pejJSO)\n\nIt was not immediately clear who took down the website.\n\nHuawei announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony, in August. But analysts are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.", "description": "A China-based website that allowed for manual installation of Google's Android apps on Huawei's newly launched Mate 30 devices went offline on Wednesday after a security researcher highlighted the \"backdoor\" to sidestep a U.S. ban.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436151666&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910EU"}
