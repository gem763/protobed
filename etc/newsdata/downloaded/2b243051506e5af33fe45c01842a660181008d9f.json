Mitt Romney reliably turn on their party\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are lucky that they don\u2019t have any Mitt Romney types. They may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!\u201d tweeted the president.\n\nHe has been ripping Mr. Romney since the Utah Republican sided with a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower who accusing Mr. Trump of abuse of power and spurred House Democrats\u2019 new impeachment effort.\n\nBut Mr. Trump was also calling attention to an age-old Washington rubric by which Republican lawmakers who rebel against their leadership become darlings of the news media. In this way, Mr. Romney follows in the footsteps of the late John McCain, whose reputation as a \u201cmaverick\u201d critic of his own GOP eventually propelled him to the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Trump blistered at Mr. Romney lending credence to the impeachment push.\n\n\u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nHe also blasted Mr. Romney, the 2014 Republican presidential nominee, for being one of his most outspoken critics since arriving in the Senate last year.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s!\u201d wrote the president.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s support among Republicans has remained relatively strong despite the whistleblower accusation. However, a predictable list of Republican that also includes moderate Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and anti-Trump diehard Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska have condemned the president\u2019s actions.\n\nMr. Romney said he doubted Mr. Trump\u2019s explanation that he asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, as part of an anti-corruption push in that country.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Romney tweeted Friday.\n\nMr. Romney also called it \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d for Mr. Trump to publicly call on Ukraine and China to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in those countries while his father was in the White House have raised eyebrows. It\u2019s at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s push for a corruption probe that spurred an intelligence community whistleblower complaint and a new impeachment effort.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
