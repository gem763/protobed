Russia has bought 106 tons of the precious metal this year.\n\n\u201cThey can read the writing on the wall,\u201d Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff told FOX Business, adding that the two countries are \u201cpreparing for the world where the dollar is no longer the reserve currency.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s gold reserves now stand at more than 1,950 tons, Bloomberg says. Russia has more than 2,200 tons, and has the fifth-largest stockpile by country.\n\nBeijing\u2019s gold purchases, which amount to 100 tons since December, come as it has been less aggressively buying Treasurys amid the U.S-China trade war. In June, China fell behind Japan as the world\u2019s largest holder of U.S. debt, a title it had held since May 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has more than quadrupled its reserves over the past decade amid its promise to break its reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russia\u2019s central bank has bought 106 tons so far this year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTrade war uncertainty and worries about the health of the global economy have helped propel gold prices to their highest level in six years. The precious metal is up almost 18 percent this year and last month hit $1,550 an ounce for the first time since April 2013.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cPrices of precious metals look set to remain elevated, but their recent rally looks overdone,\u201d wrote commodities analysts at the London-based Capital Economics. The firm sees gold hovering around $1,500 an ounce for the rest of the year.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "China and Russia are loading up on gold.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
