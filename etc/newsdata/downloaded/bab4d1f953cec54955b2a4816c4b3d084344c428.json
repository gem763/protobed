Within three days in the past tumultuous week, public opinion as measured in a Morning Consult poll swung a head-snapping 13 points in favor of an impeachment process.\n\nSome Republicans whose principal election fear used to be of being \u201cprimaried\u201d are beginning to worry more about running with Mr. Trump. They\u2019d prefer not to be associated with parts of his agenda or his increasingly erratic behavior. Though the 2018 midterms wiped out numerous leaning-to-center Republicans, there are signs of Republican discontent with Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukraine.\n\nYet the usual small group of House Republicans is being obstreperous, and in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, who\u2019s also the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has gone the furthest of Republicans in attacking the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe has heatedly called the investigation \u201ca sham\u201d and \u201ca political set-up,\u201d charging that the whistle-blower\u2019s version of the conversation that\u2019s at the heart of the matter didn\u2019t match the notes of the conversation released by the White House (the differences could only be technical). He has insisted that Mr. Trump\u2019s pressing for \u201ca favor\u201d from Ukraine\u2019s neophyte president wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo, which it obviously was because it followed directly the Ukraine president\u2019s request for the military aid that Congress had approved.\n\nBut most Republicans remain silent. Many of them know that Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior toward Ukraine is indefensible. And they\u2019re aware that damning new disclosures can burst upon them anytime. A Senate Democrat with friends across the aisle (it happens) described his Republican colleagues as \u201cnervous as hell.\u201d\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the one-man roadblock, behaved most unusually, for him, last week. First, he allowed Senate adoption of a unanimous consent request sponsored by the Democrats that the text of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint be released to Congress, as required by law. (The administration had cooked up excuses to not release it.) Mr. McConnell also said that if the House voted to impeach the president, the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to hold a trial.\n\nIf two-thirds of the senators, which would require 20 Republicans, voted to convict, Mr. Trump would have to surrender the presidency. When Nixon saw this coming, he resigned. If the articles of impeachment are carefully and thoughtfully drawn, if they indicate the comprehensiveness of Mr. Trump\u2019s disregard for the Constitution, it would be unwise to rule out anything.\n\nBut even if the president isn\u2019t convicted, Republican votes to impeach can still count for a lot. If the managers of the impeachment drive proceed in a manner that attracts even some Republican votes \u2014 say, eight or 10, especially in the Senate \u2014 this could at least impinge on Mr. Trump\u2019s inevitable claims that the whole thing has been a \u201cpartisan witch hunt.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Drew, a political journalist who for many years covered Washington for The New Yorker, is the author of \u201cWashington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon\u2019s Downfall.\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
