The issuance consists of notes backed by a pool of first-ranking Australian residential full-documentation mortgage loans originated by Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL, A/Stable/F1). The notes will be issued by Perpetual Limited in its capacity as trustee of PUMA Series 2019-1. This is a separate and distinct trust created under a master trust deed. PUMA Series 2019-1 ----A ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; RO:Sta ----B ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; NR(EXP)sf KEY RATING DRIVERS Operational Risk: MBL is a registered authorised deposit-taking institution headquartered in Sydney. Fitch undertook an onsite operational review and found that the operations of the originator and Macquarie Securitisation Limited (MSL), the servicer, were comparable with market standards and that there were no material changes that may affect either MBL's or MSL's ability to undertake administration and collection activities, respectively. MSL's collection timelines, policies and procedures are in line with other conforming lenders in Australia, as evident from the historical performance of MBL conforming transactions which have been serviced by MSL. Asset Analysis : The 'AAAsf' weighted-average foreclosure frequency (WAFF) of 8.8% is driven by the weighted-average (WA) unindexed loan/value ratio (LVR) of 62.4% and, under Fitch's methodology, investment loans of 35.4%. The 'AAAsf' lender's mortgage insurance (LMI) dependent weighted-average recovery rate (WARR) of 75.9% is driven by the portfolio's WA indexed scheduled LVR of 67.1%, 87.0% of the pool benefiting from LMI and the portfolio 'AAAsf' WA market value decline of 61.5%. Liquidity Analysis: The class A notes benefit from credit enhancement of 8.0%. Structural features include a liquidity reserve sized at 1.3% of the asset balances with a floor of AUD706,550. The class A can withstand all relevant Fitch 'AAAsf' stresses applied in our cash-flow analysis. Macroeconomic Factors: Fitch expects stable mortgage performance supported by sustained economic growth in Australia. Fitch forecasts steady annual GDP growth of 1.7% over 2019, stable labour markets and low interest rates to support the Outlook on the rated notes. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased credit enhancement may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis of the ratings by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions.Fitch applies the recovery rate stress to the pre-LMI recovery rate to isolate the effect of a change in recovery proceeds at the borrower level. Expected impact on note rating of increased defaults: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf Increase defaults by 15%: AAAsf Increase defaults by 30%: AAAsf Expected impact on note rating of decreased recoveries: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf Reduce recoveries by 15%: AAAsf Reduce recoveries by 30%: AAAsf Expected impact on note rating of multiple factors: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf Increase defaults by 15% and reduce recoveries by 15%: AAAsf Increase defaults by 30% and reduce recoveries by 30%: AAAsf The transaction structure supports LMI-independent ratings for the class A notes. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of MBL's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was available for this transaction. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis, according to its applicable rating methodologies, indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: - loan-by-loan data provided by MBL as at 25 June 2019; and - transaction documentation provided by Allen Overy, the issuer's counsel. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
