Neither the nationality of the victims, nor the origin of the container is currently known.\n\nThe truck was removed from the scene yesterday afternoon, with the 39 victims still believed to be inside, as police begin the process of identifying them.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing and the latest pictures showed two properties in Northern Ireland being raided by police.\n\nPolice are pictured outside a property in the Laurelvale area of Co Armagh in Northern Ireland after a murder investigation was launched\n\nOfficers were also seen outside this property in the Markethill area (above) as they continue to investigate those thought to be involved\n\nTwo officers were seen outside the property in Markethill after the arrest of local man Mo Robinson, 25\n\nMo Robinson (pictured left and right) is the truck driver arrested after 39 people were found dead in the back of a lorry he was driving\n\nWhile several officers raided a property in Laurelvale, others were also seen outside a property in the Markethill area, where a van had been parked outside.\n\nOther shots show the officers entering one of the properties and going inside.\n\nDetectives now say the refrigerated trailer containing the victims arrived at Purfleet from Zeebrugge in Belgium at around 12.30am on Wednesday while the front section known as the tractor came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe lorry and trailer left the port shortly after 1.05am and officers were called around 30 minutes later after ambulance staff made the grim discovery at Waterglade Industrial Park in Eastern Avenue in nearby Grays.\n\nThe vehicle driver, named in reports as 25-year-old Mo Robinson from Portadown in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland, is being held by Essex police on suspicion of murder.\n\nOne officer was seen to be carrying what looked like a red clip board as he entered the property this evening\n\nRobinson arrived in the UK at the weekend. He picked up the trailer, which had been shipped from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, yesterday evening. Minutes later, he pulled into the Essex industrial estate and the alarm was raised\n\nIt is believed that the driver may have alerted the authorities himself and sources close to the investigation last night told The Telegraph that it was 'unlikely' he had known about any plans to smuggle people.\n\nThis is while it was also discovered that the cab of the truck was registered in Bulgaria in 2017, by an Irish woman.\n\nBulgarian officials stated that the cab had not been back to the town of Varna for two years.\n\nThe area is prolific for its fuel and cigarette smuggling route with links to Irish republican gangs.\n\nThis is while the container has been linked to an Irish firm which is headquartered in Dublin, yet is registered in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe trailer is understood to be refrigerated, meaning temperatures inside could have been as low as -25C.\n\nPolice officers bowed their heads as the truck passed. Detectives have begun the process of trying to identify 39 bodies found in a lorry on an industrial estate in Essex\n\nA border force lorry arrived at the Port of Tilbury in Essex last night where the lorry that 39 bodies were found inside has been moved to\n\nDescribing the conditions inside, Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said, if the was refrigerated was switched on, conditions inside would have been 'absolutely horrendous' and would kill anyone inside 'pretty quickly'.\n\nMr Burnett added: 'It's going to be dark. If the fridge is running it's going to be incredibly cold.\n\n'The only place to go to the toilet is on board the back of the trailer. You can imagine if they've been in there for days then there will be faeces, there will be urine.'\n\nThe deaths will lead to renewed calls for added checks on vehicles entering Britain through so-called 'soft spot' ports, with Border Force resources currently focused on Dover.\n\nThe city of Varna in Bulgaria where it has been reported that the lorry where 39 victims froze to death at Grays in Essex\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said: 'In order to ensure we maintain the dignity of the people who sadly lost their lives, we will be moving the lorry and the trailer shortly.'\n\nShe said they were being moved to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies can be recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims.\n\n'We are yet to identify them and must manage this sensitively with their families,' she added.\n\nHer comments come after politicians from all sides of the spectrum pledged to tackle the issues which had risen to the forefront of Prime Minister's Question's yesterday.\n\nBoris Johnson has said that people traffickers 'should be hunted down and brought to justice'. As Home Secretary Priti Patel has also pledged for tougher sentences for human traffickers.\n\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions Mr Johnson said the situation was an 'unimaginable tragedy and truly heartbreaking'.\n\nPutting the Brexit crisis aside, he said the 'full force of the law' would come down on those responsible.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson (pictured above) said those responsible should be 'hunted down' during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday\n\nJeremy Corbyn (pictured above) also reflected on the tragedy, branding it 'unbelievable' during Prime Minister's Questions\n\nHe added: 'I know that the thoughts and prayers of all members will be with those who lost their lives and their loved ones.\n\n'I'm receiving regular updates. The Home Office will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened.'\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn also reflected on the tragedy, branding it 'unbelievable'.\n\nHe said: 'Can we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container?'\n\nMs Patel also highlighted that she would be happy to engage in discussions with the Ministry of Justice in order to see what could be done about the situation.\n\nShe said that 'Home Office immigration officials will be working closely alongside them to establish how this horrific event came to happen.'\n\nPriti Patel (above) said she would be happy to engage in discussions with the Ministry of Justice following the tragedy\n\nTragedy comes after trafficking gang jailing Today's tragedy comes less than a week after a Bulgarian trafficking gang were jailed for keeping women as sex slaves while they lived the high life. Iliya Mihaylov and Marian Ninov Vasilev Eleonora Vasileva, 34, Iliya Mihaylov, 31, and Marian Ninov Vasilev, also 34, trafficked women from their home country to squalid east London flats and forced them into a life of prostitution and Class A drug dealing. Their victims were greeted at the airport, forced to pay \u00a3200 and then moved to rented apartments. The group ran brothels across east London, and victims were rarely allowed to leave their squalid flats. The women were expected to work 24 hours a day, accepting any 'clients' immediately and unconditionally, to whom they were also forced to sell class A drugs. There is no suggestion the gang were involved in today's tragedy.\n\nAlp Mehmet, the chairman of the group Migration Watch UK, called on the government to better patrol Britain's borders to ensure such tragedies were not repeated.\n\nHe said: 'People-trafficking is a sickening business. It continues not only because the traffickers make huge amounts of money from it but are also often able to get away with it.\n\n'The risk is that more such tragedies will occur for so long as the UK fails to properly resource the border and return those who have no right to be here, which all but encourages traffickers to ply their trade by exploiting people who put their lives in their evil hands.'\n\nDespite the investigation being at an early stage and it being unclear where the victims died, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has already blamed the British government.\n\nThe charity's chief executive Satbir Singh said: 'Nobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy which has deliberately closed down safe and legal routes into Britain.'\n\nBulgarian foreign ministry spokesman Tsvetana Krasteva said: 'We are in contact with our embassy in London and with British authorities.'\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said: 'We are aware of this tragic incident which is now the subject of a murder investigation being led by Essex Police and we have deployed NCA officers to assist.\n\n'We are working with partners including Essex Police and Immigration Enforcement to provide specialist support to urgently identify and take action against any organised crime groups who might have played a role in causing these deaths.'\n\nIn 2015, 71 migrants, including eight women and four children, were found dead in the back of a Slovakian meat lorry which was abandoned truck on an Austrian motorway.\n\nThe industrial estate where the lorry was found on Wednesday is next to the Dartford Crossing and is used as a stopping point for lorries travelling south to the Port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel, although the planned route of the lorry involved is unknown.\n\nIt is the biggest disaster of its kind since 2000, when 58 Chinese stowaways died on a ferry from Belgium to Britain.", "description": "Police in Northern Ireland are carrying out raids as detectives continue to probe the journey of a lorry driver and his vehicle that carried 39 migrants to their deaths.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/23/20106688-0-image-a-67_1571869148997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
