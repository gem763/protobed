Comedy police officer quits after being rapped for non-PC gags on his satirical blog", "language": "en", "text": "A senior detective has quit the Metropolitan Police after being disciplined for making \u2018gentle\u2019 police jokes on his satirical comedy blog.\n\nDetective Inspector Paul Byrne was at the forefront of London\u2019s fight against knife crime and worked on numerous murder investigations during an unblemished 25-year career.\n\nBut his blog entitled A Guide To The British Police and intended as \u2018light satire\u2019 upset his sensitive bosses, who believed it damaged the force\u2019s public image.\n\nMr Byrne, who was based at Ealing, West London, had permission to pursue comedy writing and stand-up performing. He was given \u2018formal management action\u2019 over his blog \u2013 which he described as a rap over the knuckles\n\nIn one section, Mr Byrne joked: \u2018Today\u2019s policing is... short, ever since the height restrictions were abolished to provide employment outside panto season.\u2019\n\nThe 47-year-old, who took early retirement a fortnight ago, said: \u2018They tried to suggest this was offensive to small people and that other observations were offensive.\n\n\u2018But there were no complaints from the public or from fellow officers. You would need something wrong with you to think the blog was serious or anything other than a humorous take on policing.\u2019\n\nPolice officers can take on additional employment outside their working hours with approval from their force.\n\nIn one section, Mr Byrne joked: \u2018Today\u2019s policing is... short, ever since the height restrictions were abolished to provide employment outside panto season' [File photo]\n\nMr Byrne, who was based at Ealing, West London, had permission to pursue comedy writing and stand-up performing.\n\n\u2018I started the blog not to make money but as an indulgence, just for my own amusement,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I was also doing a bit of stand-up. I decided to make the blog public and it was extremely well-received. But then I received a phone call from a chief inspector warning me to take the post down because it had annoyed senior management.\u2019\n\nMr Byrne reluctantly agreed to do so but was then told he would still face disciplinary measures.\n\nHe was given \u2018formal management action\u2019 \u2013 which he described as a rap over the knuckles.\n\nHis blog begins: \u2018This is a guide to policing in the real world... The police contain two sorts of people \u2013 men and women. I have worked with both during my career.\n\n\u2018Police officers can be readily identified by other police officers. The trick is to look for the ones balancing a silly pointy hat on their head. Others will have a variety of pips and crowns or stripes on their shoulders designating rank.\n\n\u2018The higher the rank, the higher the level of self-regard. You are promoted by people with even higher levels of self-regard than your own.\u2019\n\nMr Byrne said a senior officer highlighted \u2018offensive\u2019 passages during a disciplinary interview.\n\nIn one, he wrote: \u2018Officers at airports are given guns which they use to indicate where Gate 17 is before going for a lie-down.\u2019\n\nOffensive? Sexist? Judge for yourself Forget the laughing policeman \u2013 Met chiefs were left stony-faced by Paul Byrne\u2019s blog, forcing him to quit the force. But was his arresting humour guilty of causing offence? Judge for yourself... \u2018You have to have a grey beard to do this job. Stick-on beards are acceptable for female officers since 2012 when they were recognised as an under-represented group in Royalty Protection.\u2019 \u2018A colleague spent ten hours\u2026 watching a drug dealer\u2019s address. Exiting the van, he was surprised to see \u201cpolice surveillance van\u201d spray-painted [on] the side. The van remained in use as no one could agree what budget a re-spray should come from.\u2019 \u2018The murder squad never close a case. They just forget about the ones they haven\u2019t solved. The more wooden officers get to go on Crimewatch and say \u201cYes Kirsty, that\u2019s right\u201d for no reason.\u2019 \u2018The Directorate of Professional Standards targets corrupt officers. Whenever a DPS officer visits, everyone sits silently and deletes their internet history... DPS officers sleep soundly knowing they are not as unpopular as Traffic Officers.\u2019\n\nThis, he said, was \u2018completely harmless, but I was told, ludicrously, that people might believe armed officers need to lie down after giving directions.\u2019\n\nMr Byrne added: \u2018While kids are being stabbed to death on the streets of London, senior management were wasting time disciplining me over a comedy blog which, if anything, was helping to make police seem more human.\n\n\u2018The Met Police is obsessed with its corporate image, meeting targets and ticking boxes. After the disciplinary action, I decided to bring forward my retirement.\u2019\n\nHe now plans to pursue comedy full-time and has reposted his blog with the headline: \u2018This blog post was BANNED by the Metropolitan Police!\u2019\n\nA spokesman for Scotland Yard said: \u2018The content of a personal blog, written by a serving Met officer, was reviewed after concerns were raised internally.\n\n\u2018The blog was taken down and management action in the form of words of advice was given.\u2019", "description": "Detective Inspector Paul Byrne was at the forefront of London's fight against knife crime and worked on numerous murder investigations during an unblemished 25-year career.", "authors": ["Ian Gallagher Chief Reporter For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19940870-0-image-a-19_1571528422153.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
