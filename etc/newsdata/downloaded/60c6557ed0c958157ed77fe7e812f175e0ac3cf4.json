It\u2019s a quick questionnaire, and then they ask for some survey information before giving you your results. The screening is anonymous, and the survey data is only so they can collect information about what kinds of people are using it.\n\nAnother online tool is from Mental Health America, which provides a depression screening questionnaire as well as others for anxiety, eating disorders, and more. Immediately after taking the test, you\u2019ll see your results, and the website also offers more information on questions you may have if you\u2019re feeling depressed or anxious.\n\nAn online screening can help satisfy your curiosity while you consider making an appointment. That said, after you get your results, you should still contact a professional if you scored highly or if you had concerns.", "description": "If this week's mental health awareness day had you wondering if maybe you should seek help, you should know that you can take a depression screening online, and bring the results to a mental health professional....", "authors": ["Whitson Gordon", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/cqdnwi5ntfevudwq3ows.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
