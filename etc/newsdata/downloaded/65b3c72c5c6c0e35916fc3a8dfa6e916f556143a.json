Regardless of anything I was so amazed to get to the Semi Final, of course everyone wants to get to the Final, but I was so happy to get to where I did.\n\n\"I have to say I found it slightly crazy that I got here and overall I have absolutely loved every minute of it.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAnalysis her semi-final performance, Rosie said: \"For my signature of Lemon raspberry tarts with a hint of mint - Prue said she absolutely loved the colour, and the size and decoration of them was perfect. Paul said the cr\u00e8me pat was a bit too soft, but I knew it hadn\u2019t set properly.\n\n\"The Technicals are always so tricky, but this one was particularly difficult, a rectangular two layer croquembouche. But what would you expect in a Semi Final? Prue liked my crisp pastry and even though the choux buns were upside down, she said it was delicious and amazingly I came first in the Technical! It was my most stressful bake ever and yet I won it. I tried to keep talking to myself and to keep calm at all times.\n\n\"I did get behind in my Showstopper which was ironic as it was called Time with My Family, although Paul thought the tart in the middle was delicious.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nRosie admitted being in the famous tent made her more clumsy - and she was pleased to make a friend in Noel.\n\nShe said: \"\"In Episode 5 I dropped the Custard Tarts - it was awful at the time in the tent but when it was shown on television it did become a very funny talking point, and social media went a bit crazy about it. And then I nearly dropped the Gateau St Honore in Episode 9! I can be clumsy but not that bad, I think it was being in the tent!\n\n\u2018I had some chats with Noel about various veterinary practices - I didn\u2019t think they were funny at the time, it\u2019s what I do for a living. They did seem to cover every animal and practice. When I said one of my bakes was eggy rubber \u2013 he said that would be a great name for a band. I always thought I would get on well with Sandi, but I thought that I wouldn\u2019t have anything in common with Noel, but we really hit it off, and I think he enjoyed our bizarre conservations.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nShe also thanked her veterinary practice staff for supporting her throughout the series.\n\nThe vet said: \"My practice staff have been great and they have all enjoyed the show and encouraged me each week. All the clients of course know that I am on the show so each appointment has to include a catch up about Bake Off!\n\n\"I love spending time with my husband and family, but I hardly saw him during Bake Off unless he was cleaning up the kitchen. He has been an incredible support - he would go to a 24 hour supermarket shop at 2am to get eggs that I had run out of. I had to practice at night because I was working all day.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nRosie admitted she had a great time on the show as she described her best and worst moments.\n\nShe said: \"My best moment in the series was the Semi Final. It was a sunny day, there were only 4 of us in the tent and we went off into the woods at the end of the day for vox pop filming and that was fun. My worst moment was dropping my tart on the floor in Episode 5. I knew that I wasn\u2019t allowed to swear and there was absolutely no way that I could fix it, it was beyond repair, so I just kept calm and carried on. Henry came and picked it up for me and Sandi cleaned the carpet. How lovely is that?\n\n\"If I had any regrets it would be that I should have done some things in a simpler way, but I wanted to push myself and stretch my skills. Maybe that was a bad game plan!\n\n\"The judges were great, I got on so well with both Prue and Paul, and I really absorbed all of Prue\u2019s comments and they helped me a lot. I am still baking of course - it is my go to thing to relax of an evening. And all my friends and family get excited, especially now, if I make them a cake.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n\"One of the funnier moments was Noel\u2019s reaction to some of my answers because at the time I was busy concentrating on my baking and didn\u2019t see his face, so that made me laugh when I watched it during transmission as I had missed a lot in the tent as I was focussed on what I was doing!\n\n\"I have a nut allergy so I was so amazed that the production team took that on board, had me in the tent and had to adapt certain practices for filming, everyone worked around it so well, the back room production team were incredible and flexible.\"\n\nOn her future, she added: \"I have no idea what will happen for me next, in the meantime I am a fulltime vet and I love my job, caring for animals, which is very rewarding. And I will continue baking and hopefully make more time for it in the future, who knows what will happen?\"\n\n*The Great British Bake Off airs Tuesdays on Channel 4 at 8pm", "description": "The Great British Bake Off semi-final was hotly contested and ended with Rosie Brandreth-Poynter's departure", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20701686.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GBBO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
