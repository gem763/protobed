Don\u2019t use those words,\u201d Conway told reporters at the White House on Friday. \u201cI didn\u2019t threat. It\u2019s not a threat. I never threatened her.\u201d\n\nThe conservative paper on Thursday published the audio recording and transcript of the call in which Conway lashed out at breaking news reporter Caitlin Yilek for an article about Conway reportedly being considered as President Donald Trump\u2019s next chief of staff. Yilek wrote that \u201cConway has been in the middle of Trump\u2019s barbs with her husband,\u201d attorney George Conway, an ardent critic of the president.\n\nConway tore into the reporter during the phone call for mentioning her husband, saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it has nothing to do with my job, which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious, then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here,\u201d Conway added.\n\nExaminer editor in chief Hugo Gurdon, in a statement after the paper released the recording, accused Conway of \u201cabusing, bullying and threatening\u201d Yilek during the call, which started as an off-the-record discussion between the reporter and Conway\u2019s assistant, Tom Joannou, before Conway jumped on the line. Many other media outlets, including HuffPost, characterized Conway\u2019s remarks as a threat.\n\nConway, confronted Friday by reporters asking whether it was \u201cappropriate to threaten that reporter,\u201d said her comments were misconstrued.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, don\u2019t use that word if it\u2019s not true. Do not,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I threaten someone, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d\n\nAsked repeatedly what she meant with her remark about personal lives, Conway suggested it was \u201cvery obvious,\u201d adding, \u201cWho cares?\u201d\n\n\u201cI still didn\u2019t get an answer from her, which was [to] the essential question, which was, why do you call yourself a breaking news reporter if you\u2019re not writing breaking news and you\u2019re not even being a reporter? Don\u2019t characterize the way I feel without ever having met me, talked to me or called me.\u201d\n\nBloomberg News reported on Wednesday that Trump is considering replacing his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, with Conway, though the president later denied that on Twitter. Kellyanne Conway notoriously avoids addressing her husband\u2019s ongoing Twitter battle with Trump, and has reacted angrily before to questions about their evident political differences.", "description": "The presidential counselor denied threatening a Washington Examiner reporter after the paper released a recording of their heated phone call.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db31c1d210000cf2c34b11f.jpeg?cache=jrrikjdzo8&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
