(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)\n\nAs Mark Zuckerberg readies to testify before the House Financial Services Committee in D.C. on Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer took the stage in Los Angeles to defend the social network\u2019s policy of not fact-checking political ads.\n\nSheryl Sandberg acknowledged the company continues to allow for factually inaccurate posts to continue to proliferate on the site, but says that they aren\u2019t distributed as widely if they are flagged as \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we have misinformation...unless it\u2019s hate that will lead to real world violence, we need to let the debate continue. We don\u2019t want things to go viral, we mark those as false, and it dramatically reduces sharing. If it\u2019s hate \u2014 if someone really shows up to the polls on the wrong day, we need to take it down,\u201d she said at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u2018There were certainly disagreements over Mark\u2019s speech\u2019\n\nSandberg\u2019s comments came after Zuckerberg defended allowing politicians to lie in their ads at a speech during Georgetown University\u2019s \u201cDemocracy in a Digital Age\u201d event last week. His comments sparked criticism, including from Democratic presidential front-runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, the latter of whom accused Facebook of actively helping President Donald Trump spread lies.\n\n\u201cThere were certainly disagreements over Mark\u2019s speech,\u201d Sandberg said. \u201cThe transparency is dramatically different this time around. You can see the origin of where a person is. If you look at our ad library we didn\u2019t have this [in 2016]. You can see any political ad anywhere in the country even if they\u2019re not targeting you. Now you can see everything. Yesterday, we launched a presidential ad tracker so you can see the campaigns much more holistically.\u201d\n\nEchoing Zuckerberg\u2019s rationale, she said, \u201cWe take political ads because we believe they\u2019re part of political discourse. If you look at it over time, the people who benefit from running ads are those who aren\u2019t covered by mainstream media, people who have different points of view, and those who aren\u2019t incumbents.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve taken much stronger steps on hate, looked at white nationalism, separatism, and we\u2019ve really come down on a strong policy of voter suppression, which we\u2019re considering as hate,\u201d she added.\n\nFacebook does not allow hate speech, terrorism, violence, bullying, and voter suppression, but Zuckerberg and Sandberg believe that blatant lies in political ads or posts about a news event are not as toxic.\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 22: (L-R) Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and Katie Couric speak onstage during 'Putting a Best Facebook Forward' at Vanity Fair's 6th Annual New Establishment Summit at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on October 22, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Vanity Fair) More\n\n\u201cWe have a very strong free expression bent. If something is false, we don\u2019t take it down. We send it to third party fact checkers. We dramatically decrease distribution \u2014 to about 20% \u2014 and we show related articles. The challenges of scale here are really important. A lot of the areas we\u2019re reluctant to weigh in on is because we know we can\u2019t do this well at scale,\u201d she said.\n\nSandberg, who has been Facebook\u2019s COO for 11 and a half years, said her role has dramatically shifted \u2014 instead of a focus on growth, it\u2019s about curbing bad actors, which could be at odds with Facebook\u2019s advertising-dependent business model.\n\n\u2018It is whack-a-mole\u2019\n\nAt one point, interviewer Katie Couric questioned Sandberg about how 30,000 human content moderators could possibly manage the millions of bad content being posted every single day.\n\n\u201cOur job is to build technology to take things down as quickly as possible. It is whack-a-mole but it is the price of free speech...and we see all the beauty and all the ugly of humanity,\u201d said Sandberg.\n\nWith 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp once a month, would the only possibility to clean up bad actors to be to shut down the website entirely?\n\n\u201cOur job is to get as much of it down as possible. I don\u2019t think the temporary shut down will solve the problem,\u201d Sandberg said.", "description": "As Mark Zuckerberg readies to testify before the House Financial Services Committee in D.C. on Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer took the stage in Los Angeles to defend the social network\u2019s policy of not fact-checking political ads.", "authors": ["Melody Hahm", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fT_dX51br5gsUnTOQ0Pfig--~B/aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a3b65b30-f51b-11e9-bfff-1d83ee0d148f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
