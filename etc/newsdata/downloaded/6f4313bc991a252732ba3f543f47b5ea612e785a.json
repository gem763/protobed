The west is expected to prove more challenging for an armoured assault due to narrow alleys crisscrossing the ancient districts. ISIL fighters are expected to hide and attack from positions among the city\u2019s civilians.", "description": "After nearly three years under ISIL control, Mosul airport is captured by Iraqi security forces, state television announces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/358769/1000x563_358769.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-23"}
