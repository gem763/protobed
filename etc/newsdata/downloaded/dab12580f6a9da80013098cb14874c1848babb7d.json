Afterwards Hearn urged the British Boxing Board of Control to change its rules so that VAR could be used in fights it sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe WBC\u2019s instant replay system, which has been used quite a bit now, is not allowed by the British Boxing Board of Control,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got 12 screens that we put up around the thing now, you can\u2019t ignore it \u2013 so it was absolutely 100% the right thing to do for Mauricio to reverse the decision.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he was in favour of VAR for boxing, Hearn said: \u201cYes, absolutely. What\u2019s the downside? There is none. It\u2019s not as if it is going to slow the game down. That\u2019s the problem that people talk about with football and cricket. There\u2019s this big controversy. He can\u2019t get up. So let\u2019s look at it. They look at it very quickly, and they\u2019ll rule on it very quickly.\u201d\n\nVasiliy Lomachenko outpoints Luke Campbell to add WBC lightweight title Read more\n\nHearn also insisted Luke Campbell, who was taken to hospital as a precaution after losing an epic fight against Vasiliy Lomachenko, the WBA, WBC and WBO lightweight champion, was good enough to win a world title.\n\n\u201cSometimes in defeat, your stock rises considerably,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s happened with Luke. He\u2019s like a hero and the crowds love the fact that you\u2019re crippled to the body, you\u2019re on one knee, and you don\u2019t want to go down and when you do you get up. And, you know, he didn\u2019t need to do that, really. At times in the fight, he could have been excused for saying \u2018that\u2019s enough\u2019. But even the last round he was always trying to win the fight.\u201d\n\nHearn predicted Lomachenko would unify the lightweight title early next year and then relinquish the belts \u2013 allowing Campbell a third shot at a title. \u201cI don\u2019t want Luke to fight Lomachenko again so we\u2019ve got to see if we can get in position to challenge for a vacant belt,\u201d he said.", "description": "Charlie Edwards\u2019 fight was declared a no-contest by the WBC president after an illegal punch by Julio C\u00e9sar Mart\u00ednez was shown on screens ringside", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e177a9cc50a1d45ff7520abd0ef87f447d134cdb/0_171_4884_2929/master/4884.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a37dfd7dc23cdafaa77c86fdbe08c821"}
