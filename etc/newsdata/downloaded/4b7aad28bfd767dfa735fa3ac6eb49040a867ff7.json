Kavanaugh Won't Be Impeached.", "language": "en", "text": "Democrats are calling for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following the New York Times' ridiculous hit piece this weekend alleging to have details about a new accuser and sexual assault allegation against the sitting justice. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has made one thing very clear: impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh will not happen.\n\nAs Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations.https://t.co/MBpW3G8zOk \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 16, 2019\n\nGraham made one thing very clear: the New York Times writes \"scurrilous accusations\" against Kavanaugh and then verifies them after the fact. That became apparent when the news organization went back and added a correction to their story.\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: Sept. 15, 2019\n\nAn earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nWhat have we learned the last few days?\n\n\n\n* The @nytimes writes first, verifies later.\n\n\n\n* Republicans are presumed to be \u201cguilty.\u201d\n\n\n\n* Democratic presidential candidates are willing to ruin Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s life for political gain.\n\n\n\nAll very sad. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 16, 2019\n\nThe latest attacks leveled against Brett Kavanaugh are beyond the pale.\n\n\n\nMy heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 16, 2019\n\nSomething to remember: the Senate Judiciary Committee published a 400-page report last November. The Committee found that the allegations lacked any credibility or corroboration.", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:13:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/121/d2550755-e23e-4344-89be-7126bf5f16da.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
