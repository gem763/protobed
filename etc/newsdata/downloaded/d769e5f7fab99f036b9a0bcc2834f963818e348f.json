It\u2019s now home to massive deals, like IBM buying Red Hat for $34 billion and Fortnite maker Epic Games raising a landmark $1.25 billion, both which helped to put the state \u2014 and the Triangle region, in particular \u2014 on the map. And now it\u2019s just minted another unicorn with Pendo\u2019s last fundraise. But its tech hub potential can still be threatened by the state\u2019s political swings, said Salesforce Ventures head John Somorjai, who spoke today at a tech event in Durham.\n\nOn a panel at Bull City Venture Partners\u2019 Entrepreneurs\u2019 Series 2019, Somorjai reminded the audience that investment in the state follows the talent. And a state can\u2019t attract talent when it\u2019s not \u201cwelcoming to all people,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Carolina has had a difficult history on this front, if you recall.\n\nIn 2016, PayPal canceled plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte after N.C. passed the controversial (\u201cbathroom bill\u201d) law that prevented cities from creating non-discrimination policies based on gender identity. The state lost 400 potential jobs, as a result. Over 100 other companies, including Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, eBay, Uber, and others also asked the state to repeal the law after its passing.\n\nN.C. eventually revised the law, then reached a settlement this summer that allows transgender people to use certain bathrooms matching their gender identity. But in some cases, it was too late to woo the tech companies back.\n\nApple and Amazon have also been separately criticized, at times, for considering N.C. area investments because of the state\u2019s anti-LGBTQ leanings.\n\nThis issue now has a broad effect on the state\u2019s ability to attract tech and business investment at a time when investors are often looking outside the Valley (and its obscene valuations) to find companies that are more focused on profitability.\n\nSalesforce Ventures, a strategic investor who keeps its stake below 15%, isn\u2019t hesitant to fund companies beyond Silicon Valley \u2014 it has five investments in N.C. and 15 overall in the larger region, for example. And 75% of its investments were made outside of California, Somorjai noted.\n\nBut when asked what North Carolina\u2019s biggest challenge was, in terms of becoming home to a startup community, he alluded to the state\u2019s politics and its history of divisive laws.\n\n\u201cBefore the last election, there was an environment here that wasn\u2019t really welcoming to all people,\u201d Somorjai said. \u201cOne of [Salesforce\u2019s] core tenants \u2014 our core values \u2014 is equality. And there\u2019s really sound business sense behind that,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you have discriminatory policies, people don\u2019t feel welcome. If they don\u2019t feel welcome, they\u2019re not going to want to work there. And you will never be able to attract the best talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney flows to where the talent is,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also suggested to the event\u2019s audience \u2014 a group of some 450 entrepreneurs and hundreds more working in the area\u2019s startup ecosystem \u2014 that local community leaders should remain vigilant about these sorts of problems.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re complacent, it can happen again,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the concerns, Somorjai was generally positive about the ability for strong startups to arise in N.C.\n\nSalesforce Ventures itself invested in two N.C. area unicorns \u2014 Pendo and nCino \u2014 and it just acquired Charlotte-based MapAnything, which gives it some 200 new employees in the Tar Heel state. Elsewhere in N.C., startups AvidXchange, Red Ventures, and Tresata all have unicorn valuations.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve been so excited about is \u2014 you have these tremendous universities that are putting out great engineers every year. And you have a growing group of investors that are investing in this area. There\u2019s also now so much talent here that you\u2019re attracting investors from all over the country,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cI think that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nImage credit, top: SeanPavonePhoto/Getty Images", "description": "North Carolina has been rising as an entrepreneurial hub.
