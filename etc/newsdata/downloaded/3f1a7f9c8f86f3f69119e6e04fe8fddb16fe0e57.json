If anyone can do that, it\u2019s Kim\u2019.\n\n\u2018But she\u2019s coming back soon. And I\u2019m hoping it will be a big storyline. With Kim Fox it\u2019s got to be big. We can\u2019t just have her turning up at the cafe.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be doing. All I know is it will be a Christmas cracker.\u2019\n\nLast we saw Kim, she headed off to Scotland for a new business venture after Denise (Diane Parish) fired her from Fox & Hair for being the cause of the conflict between her and Chantelle (Jessica Plummer).\n\nKim struggled to accept the fact that Chantelle and Gray (Toby-Alexander Smith) had moved into the house she owned with Vincent (Richard Blackwood) \u2014 before he disappeared early last year after getting involved with crook Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin).\n\nDiscussing her experience thus far on the BBC One soap, Tameka said: \u2018Being at EastEnders is like going on a holiday. Even though it\u2019s work, I enjoy it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had fans saying they want to see Kim back on the show, which is really nice. It\u2019s really lovely. I do miss playing her. She keeps me on my toes. She keeps me busy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Tameka has revealed what she hopes is in store for Kim upon her return.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/16941161-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2018-84ee_1571747431.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
