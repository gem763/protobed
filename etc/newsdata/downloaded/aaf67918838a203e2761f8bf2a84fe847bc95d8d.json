Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attended a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) event on Friday and told reporters that there is already enough evidence to impeach President Donald Trump and convict him in the Senate.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator and White House hopeful told reporters at the SEIU event that she has, in fact, seen enough evidence to convict Trump in the Senate, if the inquiry leads to that.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201cevidence is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump released the transcript in which he solicited a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections, he broke the law and he did that in context of already having interfered with an investigation into the 2016 elections and Russia being invited to interfere in our elections,\u201d Warren said, resurrecting what the president informally refers to as the Mueller \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made it clear that the law doesn\u2019t apply to him and the point of the federal government is to put whatever resources at his disposal to protect himself politically and financially,\u201d she continued, according to the Washington Examiner. \u201cThat is not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached,\u201d she added.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event but did not go as far as Warren on impeachment, despite pushing for the inquiry on social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait until the evidence comes over from the House, and then I\u2019ll share my vote with you,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (D) dodged the question, telling reporters that he preferred to refrain from speculation.\n\n\u201cI am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against,\u201d he continued, calling Trump a \u201ccoward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy, like all bullies, is a coward,\u201d Biden assessed. \u201cHe does not want to run against me.\u201d\n\nSenator Kamala Harris is withholding judgment on whether she\u2019d vote to convict Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until the evidence comes over from the House, and then I\u2019ll share my vote with you,\u201d she tells reporters in Los Angeles. pic.twitter.com/VOjR0xaHsy \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 4, 2019\n\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the White House on Friday, demanding documents related to the Ukraine investigation. However, the White House signaled that it would not comply with such requests until Democrats go through proper channels and hold a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry.", "description": "Sen.
