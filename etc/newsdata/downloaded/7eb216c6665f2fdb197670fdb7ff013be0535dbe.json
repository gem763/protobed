However, its score too is lower yet again, going from 7.1 two weeks ago, to 6.6 last week, and it\u2019s 6/10 now, meaning it\u2019s on the very verge of the neutral zone. Five coins are in the 5 to 5.6 range, while four stand in the 4.1-4.9 range.\n\nSentiment change among the top 10 coins*:\n\nInterpreting the Sentscore\u2019s scale:\n\n- 0 to 2.5: very negative\n\n- 2 to 4: somewhat negative zone\n\n- 4 to 6: Neutral zone\n\n- 6 to 7.5: somewhat positive zone\n\n- 7.5 to 10: very positive\n\nSource: Omenics, 11:22 UTC\n\nThis week\u2019s top coins have all seen 14+% rise in their Sentscore: XLM\u2019s score had a 14% rise, while XRP and BCH appreciated 14.5% each. Stellar has a high grade of 6.2/10 in news, 5.2 and 5.1 in technicals and social respectively, while it got 4.6 in buzz and 3.8 in fundamentals. Similarly, XRP\u2019s strongest aspect is news with 6.4%; its technicals and social are neutral with 5.5 and 5.2 respectively, while its weakest aspects are 4.3 in fundamentals and 3.4 in buzz. Furthermore, while BCH got 7.6/10 in news, as well as 5.7 in technicals and 4.7 in social, it got only 2.9 in fundamentals and 2.8 in buzz.\n\nOne of the three coins that had seen a drop in their scores last week is the only coin to have dropped this week. Bitcoin\u2019s grade fell by 4.5% over the course of the last seven days. Its highest grades remain in fundamentals (9.3) and news (7), with its social getting a neutral 4.8/10, but its lowest grades are in technicals (3.8) and buzz (2.5).\n\nBitcoin Sentscore\n\nSource: Omenics\n\nHowever, while Monero occupied the 9th spot on the list last week, with Cardano in the 10th, it is now in the 11th, while Stellar took its spot in front of Cardano. Therefore, we can say that Monero is the unfortunate loser this week. It dropped by 1.2%, its Sentscore now being 5, compared to last week\u2019s 5.2. Its strongest aspect is news (7.4) and its weakest is buzz (3).\n\nOut of 40 coins that are currently tracked by Omenics, besides the top 10 list, five are in the negative zone this Monday, including Ethereum Classic (3.7). Additionally, twelve coins are in the 5-5.9 range, compared to five last Monday, including Tron (5.9), Tezos (5.3), and DOGE (5.1).\n\n___\n\n* - Methodology:\n\nOmenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the Sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals based upon their proprietary algorithms.\n\nAs their website explains, \u201cOmenics aggregates trending news articles and viral social media posts into an all-in-one data platform, where you can also analyze content sentiment,\u201d later adding, \u201cOmenics combines the 2 sentiment indicators from news and social media with 3 additional verticals for technical analysis, coin fundamentals, and buzz, resulting in the Sentscore which reports a general outlook for each coin.\u201d For now, they are rating 40 cryptocurrencies.", "description": "We find the average crypto market sentiment measure, Sentscore, for the top 10 coins by market capitalization at 5.01/10 this week, compared to 5.22 last Monday, thus dropping for the second week in a row, according to Omenics, a crypto market sentiment analysis service.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d8/8d26633787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
