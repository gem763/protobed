When Newcastle debutant Matthew Longstaff fired past David de Gea in the 72nd minute, the away side simply had no answer.\n\nSpeaking on Match of the Day 2, ex-Arsenal defender Keown slammed Fred\u2019s laughable display in central midfield and admitted he \u2018felt sorry\u2019 for Rashford.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPerhaps most damning of all, Keown believes Daniel James will be questioning his \u00a315million summer move from Swansea to Old Trafford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeown said : \u2018Daniel James must be thinking \u201cwho have I signed for here?\u201d\n\n\u2018He\u2019s their youngest player, but he\u2019s their best player.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re so inept in possession. Fred, it\u2019s almost becoming a joke when he gets the ball. I know it\u2019s good closing down but you\u2019ve got to be able to control it and pass.\n\n\u2018If that\u2019s the central midfield then there\u2019s not going to be anything created.\u2019\n\nRashford cut a frustrated figure up front at St James\u2019 Park (Picture: Getty)\n\nKeown added: \u2018They started playing balls long into Rashford and I feel sorry for him because he\u2019s surviving on scraps. But he should do better.\n\n\u2018Look at his body language\u2026 I think he\u2019s starting to despair with what\u2019s around him.\u2019\n\nKeown believes the defeat could signal \u2018the beginning of the end\u2019 for Solskjaer, with United failing to win on the road in their last 11 matches in all competitions.\n\n\u2018You start to look at where the system is\u2026 where\u2019s the intensity?\u2019 the former England centre-back added.\n\n\u2018I think the belief is ebbing away and this could be the beginning of the end for this manager.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to see a former player come in and leave the job but there has to be a spark, there has to be a reaction and it seems to just be spiraling out of control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is a really poor result.\u2019\n\nMORE: Robin van Persie criticises Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after Manchester United\u2019s defeat to Newcastle", "description": "Arsenal legend Martin Keown was scathing with his assessment of Manchester United after their 1-0 defeat to Newcastle and took aim at Fred, claiming the midfielder is 'becoming a joke'...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88710938-e1570432448523_1570432920.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
