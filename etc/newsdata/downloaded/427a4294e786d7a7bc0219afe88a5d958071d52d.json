Gamers were divided over the benefits of this, and the debate over it continues as more games come out as \u201cexclusive\u201d to a store. TNW got the chance to speak to Raph Koster, a legend in the industry, about the state of gaming.\n\nKoster\u2019s previous credits include Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies. Koster recently revealed he\u2019s working on a new MMO that\u2019ll capitalize on modern technology to create more immersive worlds. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the fruition of true alternate worlds that you can escape to,\u201d he told TNW. While in the course of asking him questions about this new venture \u2014 and him being appropriately tight-lipped considering the game is early in development \u2014 I decided to pick his brain a bit about the current climate in gaming.\n\nThe primary paradigm shift happening in gaming these days is the increase in platform exclusivity, along with the rise of subscription-based gaming services. In order for both of those things to succeed, companies have to get gamers on board with the new system. I was curious to hear what Koster, whose MMOs were played consistently by thousands for many years, thought about what gaming services could do to make that happen.\n\n\u201cGiven what they\u2019re trying to do, they need to think in terms of ongoing progression systems \u2014 something that allows users to invest in whatever the service is. We saw achievements serve this purpose. One that MMOs have done, but we don\u2019t tend to see as much in regular services is the idea of investing into something inside the system. Players love to leave a mark.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Koster what he thought about the way the industry has changed in the last few years, he said this: \u201cI tend to think of the game market as swinging on a pendulum between incumbent platforms and new platforms \u2014 periods that drive different kinds of innovation,\u201d said Koster, who says eventually smaller developers flee the incumbents to new platforms. \u201cThe new platforms generally have something that makes the bad at the dominant kind of game, but good at a new type of game.\u201d As an example, he mentioned mobile gaming, which allowed a new species of developer to release their games to the public.\n\nBut in the last few years, Koster mentions he hasn\u2019t seen that platform shift. \u201cVR and AR seem like they might have been it. VR didn\u2019t lend itself to smaller development studios. We\u2019re in a period of increasing maturity.\u201d\n\nI questioned if he thought the Store Wars, with their emphasis on exclusivity, would last. He said:\n\nOpenness tends to win out. Even when storefronts push exclusivity, I suspect that developers are going to find that it makes the most sense to remain on as many storefronts as possible, which has always been the case. Over the long haul, speaking with a dev hat, you want to be in a situation where you\u2019re 100 percent beholden to one of these. You want to end up in a situation where you\u2019re in control of the relationship that matters \u2014 and that\u2019s between you, the creative, and the person digging your work.\n\nRead next: Moon rocks could help us resurrect extinct species???", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F02%2F2FA-PC.jpg&signature=68e82c67a232dced82609bff1abd99ef", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
