Indeed, he asks at the beginning of the show that all reviewers not write about what happens in the show.\n\nSo, one part of this can be short and sweet: go see Derren Brown\u2019s Broadway show which opens tonight (at the Cort Theatre, to Jan. 4, 2020). Be flummoxed, amazed, floored, fascinated, freaked out, charmed, and wonderstruck. (Big names like J.J. Abrams and Thomas Kail have been\u2014they signed on as producers.)\n\nBrown is a well-known British illusionist. He sells out stadiums. He has caused controversy\u2014 from a notorious game of Russian Roulette to predicting a set of National Lottery numbers.\n\nThis Broadway show is two and a half hours, skates along so richly and efficiently you don\u2019t notice that, and not-much-changed from the 2017 off-Broadway show of the same name.\n\nThe shared elements\u2014a particular Hollywood superstar; the last extended set-piece involving members of the audience, drawing, and a word\u2014are present and still seem just as astonishing as they did on the much-smaller stage of the Atlantic Theater Company (also one of the producers on Broadway).\n\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to write about Derren Brown\u2019s show without writing about Derren Brown\u2019s show. He would smile at that. He\u2019s a wonderfully dry host for this evening of surprises, a skillful overse\u2019er of magic and illusion (he strenuously denies that he is a psychic). He toys with people, but not cruelly. He is charming, wry, brisk.\n\nHe is very funny too, noting of one mysterious stage intruder that it\u2019s Glenda Jackson (the Cort\u2019s previous resident as King Lear.)\n\nThere are some shocking moments\u2014you would be best advised to listen to Brown when he advises those with sensitive secrets to keep them to themselves on this evening.\n\nCan we believe what we see? Things happen in front our eyes that most of us do not see. There are some amazing sleights of hand. As with the best magic, the question is, \u201chow did he do that?\u201d and to think that you know\u2014just wait for after the show, and all the conflicting theories bandied excitedly about\u2014when really it is a marvelous, head-scratching mystery.\n\nWhat can one say? You will see people on the stage, people selected by frisbees being flung into the audience. Brown seems to have supreme control over them, and all events\u2014and when he doesn't, well, that seems a little convenient. How has Brown burrowed into minds, you wonder? How did he make that impossible thing just happen right in front of you?\n\nThe \u201csecret\u201d of the title refers, he says, to his keeping secret his homosexuality for such a long time; he told me a couple of years ago how he had once hoped to \u201ccure\u201d himself. Now he is happily out, and settled with partner and dog.\n\nBrown told me that there was no technical trickery involved in all the bamboozling feats he performs. There were no secret cameras, no secret plants.\n\n\u201cNone of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I say in the show. It\u2019s just getting people to tell themselves a certain story of what is happening. Ninety-nine percent of it is happening right in front of you, but you\u2019re sort of compelled to join the dots in one particular way.\u201d\n\nBrown told me that he had begun learning illusion and hypnosis while at university in Bristol, studying law and German. In his first year of study, he went to see the illusionist and hypnotist Martin S. Taylor.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those life-changing moments. I left thinking, \u2018I am going to learn how to do that.\u2019 It was a very good show. It wasn\u2019t making people look stupid. It was hilarious, and you were laughing with the participants and their bafflement, not at them.\u201d\n\n\u201c There is no actual psychic mind-reading going on, because that would be impossible. What you\u2019re left with is a spectrum of activity: conjuring through to hypnotic and other suggestion-based techniques. I take all of that and try and blend it into a compelling experience. \u201d\n\nBrown had a vague thought about being a lawyer but became \u201cobsessed by hypnosis\u2014it\u2019s about control, the man of mystery and so on.\u201d\n\nThe crafting of a show, the handsome and engaging Brown told me, was around a \u201cwhat if\u201d moment. \u201cThere is no actual psychic mind-reading going on, because that would be impossible. What you\u2019re left with is a spectrum of activity: conjuring through to hypnotic and other suggestion-based techniques. I take all of that and try and blend it into a compelling experience.\u201d\n\nThe point of Secret, he said to me, was that there are always things on stage\u2014and in one\u2019s own life\u2014that aren\u2019t the full story: \u201cSometimes you need to be aware of the bigger picture you are missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sell you a story,\u201d Brown told me. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is. I try and get you to join up the dots in a particular way. It\u2019s all there in front of you. If you\u2019re amazed by it, you\u2019ve joined up dots in a particular way. It\u2019s all perfectly explicable.\u201d\n\nHe chooses participants by how open and \u201csuggestible\u201d their faces are. People, Brown said, trap themselves into ways of thinking, and that inhibits them from figuring out what he is doing.\n\nWell, Brown is brilliant at what he does. Watch carefully, and see if you can figure out what he\u2019s doing. Whatever, while telling you nothing, hopefully I\u2019ve told you everything you need to know in order to buy a ticket for Secret right now.", "description": "Famous British illusionist Derren Brown lands on Broadway with a show he has asked reviewers not to reveal anything about.
