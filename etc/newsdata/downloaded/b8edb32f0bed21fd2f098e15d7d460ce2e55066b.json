Circuit judge, to the Supreme Court. His views on the meaning of the Constitution were considered by some of the political class to be iniquitous. The nominee\u2019s constructive criticism of the mainstream of legal analysis was its failure to show allegiance to the actual language of the Constitution. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Constitution is studied almost anywhere, including law schools. In law schools, what they study is what the court said about the Constitution. They study the opinions. They don\u2019t study the Constitution itself.\u201d\n\nOf course, the nominee was Robert Bork. His view that the Constitution had an ageless meaning was cruelly savaged by Senator Ted Kennedy. \u201cRobert Bork\u2019s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens\u2019 doors in midnight raids,\u201d and other shameful regressions would exist. Critics condemned Bork\u2019s view that the words in the Constitution mean now what they meant when written in 1787. No living, breathing, mutating Constitution for Bork. At his death in 2012, some labeled him the \u201coriginal originalist.\u201d\n\nThe Senate rejected Bork\u2019s nomination, but his approach to constitutional interpretation has thrived \u2014 though by no means has it conquered. Justice Neil Gorsuch in his new book explains and vigorously promotes originalism. The significance of that form of analysis is indicated by the title he chose for his book: A Republic, If You Can Keep It. Those were the words of Benjamin Franklin in explaining what the Constitutional Convention had created. The centrality of originalism to the survival of the Republic, Gorsuch writes, arises from separation of powers. If judges abandon their constitutional role of simply interpreting (though often it is not so simple) what the political branches have done, they are assuming the roles that the other branches are to perform.\n\nGorsuch says the book is for the general citizenry, not academics. He wants to revive and encourage \u201cinterest in the Constitution of the framers\u2019 design and the judge\u2019s role in it.\u201d Even with that goal, the author gives those who are knowledgeable, imperfectly so like this subordinate federal judge, a lot to ponder. A significant part of Gorsuch\u2019s book reprints speeches, court opinions, and other prior writings. Much new is interspersed, though.\n\nThis is not a memoir. Readers who want the details of his selection and confirmation for the Supreme Court will not be sated. One\u2019s appetite is whetted at the beginning of the book, when Gorsuch discusses receiving the White House call, being interviewed, and being announced. Then the book\u2019s final chapter, as the author previews it, \u201ccollects some of the statements I made during and shortly after the nomination and confirmation process.\u201d That\u2019s it. Justice Gorsuch may have decided that persuasively presenting his principles about the judicial role was both more appropriate and more important than recounting a recent political battle. Clarence Thomas is the one current justice who has written extensively about his confirmation controversies, but he waited 17 years to publish. As a personal aside, I too wrote about the pains and sufferings of a difficult confirmation, mine merely for a circuit court. I waited six years until the wounds had (mainly) healed.\n\nThere is just a little about his personal background. What is recounted can be charming. Gorsuch quickly describes several ancestors, including a grandfather in Denver who was a trolley-car driver, then a lawyer. This is the ancestor who had an awful voice but enjoyed using it to sing \u2014 loudly. A grandmother\u2019s family built a small hotel near a railroad depot in Wyoming, which still stands and is used by the current generation during visits to the area.\n\nMom and Dad were both lawyers, though the father little enjoyed being one. What he passed on to his son was a love of the outdoors, of camping, hunting, and skiing, but of fishing most of all. Gorsuch\u2019s mother graduated from college at age 19 and from law school at 22. She became the first female assistant district attorney in Denver, and later was a state legislator. Gorsuch\u2019s wife is a native of England. He gives a brief description of her background and their meeting while he was studying for a doctorate in England. She agreed to marry him and move to Colorado, then fell in love with the West.", "description": "Just over 30 years ago, President Ronald Reagan nominated a former Yale law professor, then serving as a D.C.
