Switchboard operators were done in by the dawn of direct dialing. And in the car industry, auto workers are deathly afraid the engine assembler will give way to battery builders.\n\nDread over the prospect that plug-in cars -- which have fewer parts and require less labor to build -- will doom auto jobs helped spark the first United Auto Workers strike against General Motors Co. in over a decade. Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which are rolling their own battery-powered models to market in the coming years, could face a similar fate if they\u2019re unable to quell the UAW\u2019s concerns that widespread adoption of EVs endangers the employment of 35,000 union members.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a potential for our jobs to be gone -- they don\u2019t need us anymore,\u201d said Tim Walbolt, president of the UAW local representing workers at a Fiat Chrysler transmission components plant near Toledo, Ohio. \u201cIt scares us.\u201d\n\nFor all the buzz generated by Tesla Inc., the EV era is still in its infancy, with zero-emission autos having reached just 2% of global production. GM has extended the UAW an offer to get in on the ground floor, pitching a new battery plant staffed by dues-paying union members in an Ohio town jarred by job loss. But the overture came with a catch: GM wants to pay the workers less, and the facility is unlikely to need as many staff as an engine or transmission factory would.\n\nA recent study of electric-vehicle production in Europe by consultant AlixPartners found that it took 40% fewer hours to assemble an electric motor and battery than a traditional internal-combustion engine and transmission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad news story from a labor perspective,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, the head of AlixPartners\u2019s automotive practice. \u201cYou would just fundamentally need less people.\u201d\n\nPerversely, GM also arguably has uncertainty on it\u2019s side at the bargaining table. It\u2019s going to want concessions to cushion itself against the risk that consumer adoption of electric autos remains slow. The carmaker isn\u2019t fully utilizing the factory that builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV north of Detroit, and tepid demand for the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt put the future of the factory that assembles it in nearby Hamtramck in doubt.\n\nCollision Course\n\nThe collision with carmakers over electrification is one the UAW saw coming.\n\n\u201cElectric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membership,\u201d Jennifer Kelly, the union\u2019s research director, said during a collective-bargaining conference in Detroit earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s almost certain to carry over from the UAW\u2019s talks with GM to negotiations with Detroit\u2019s other automakers. Ford has estimated electric cars will require 30% fewer hours of labor per vehicle and 50% less factory floor space.\n\n\u201cRationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition,\u201d Joe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s automotive president, told investors on an earnings call in April.\n\nEven Fiat Chrysler, a laggard with regard to electrification, has stoked fear at union halls linked to internal-combustion components plants, where rumors are flying that the company plans to outsource work to lower-paying suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot help but feel like the left behind stepchildren of the UAW,\u201d Mike Booth, the president of the union\u2019s local in Marysville, Michigan, wrote in a letter to the labor group\u2019s Chrysler council last month. He and other UAW leaders fear that German mega-supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG, which took over operation of a Chrysler axle plant in 2008, will take work away from the automaker\u2019s machining facility near Toledo and a transmission and castings complex in Kokomo, Indiana.\n\nA Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said the operations the union are concerned about are critical to the business. ZF will continue to work with the UAW in Marysville, and an arrangement in which Fiat Chrysler licenses technology from the supplier in Kokomo may be creating some confusion, a spokesman said. He declined to comment on Toledo.\n\n\u2018Shrinking Bubble\u2019\n\nIn August, GM shut down a transmission plant outside Detroit, affecting more than 260 workers as part of a larger restructuring. That may foreshadow other closures as EV production ramps up. The supply chain is where the job risk is greatest, especially for workers employed making engines, transmissions and sub-components that aren\u2019t needed in EVs.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The milkman went missing thanks to the rise of refrigerators.
