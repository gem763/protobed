Researchers from contact lens supplier Optical Express conducted a survey of over 3,000 UK contact lens wearers. 97 per cent of contact lens wearers are polluting the environment by throwing their used lenses away. Meanwhile, only 3 per cent recycle. This means that around 750 million lenses are dumped every year. Lenses and their plastic packaging that end up in landfill sites can take 500 years to decompose. This has the potential to let plastic pollution to leak into the soil and water. 1 in 4 respondents said they throw their lenses into the sink plughole, or flush them down the toilet. In the sewers, these can break down into tiny particles that pollute the oceans and get eaten by marine life. The survey found that people from Nottingham were the least environmentally friendly, with 98 per cent of people always throw their used lenses in the bin or down the drain. The best performing city was Bristol, where only 87 per cent of people still never recycle their plastic lenses.\n\nResearchers from contact lens supplier Optical Express conducted a survey of over 3,000 contact lens wearers in the UK to find out how they disposed of their lenses.\n\nParticipants were also asked whether they felt they had enough information about the environmental impact of various vision correction solutions and how such impacted their choices.\n\nThe researchers found that 97 per cent of contact lens wearers are inadvertently polluting the environment by throwing their used lenses away. In contrast, only 3 per cent of wearers reported recycling their lenses.\n\nAcross the UK, more than 4 million people use around 780 million contact lenses each year.\n\nThis means that over 750 million lenses are dumped every year.\n\nLenses and their plastic packaging that end up in landfill sites can take 500 years to decompose, potentially allowing plastic pollution to leak into the soil and water.\n\nOn top of this, around 1 in 4 survey respondents admitted to throwing their lenses down the sink plughole, or flushing them down the toilet.\n\nOnce in the sewers, these break down into tiny particles that pollute the oceans and are ingested by marine life.\n\n'We\u2019d suspected that some people were disposing of lenses down the drain, but it\u2019s shocking to learn the true scale of the problem,' said Optical Express Clinical Services Director Stephen Hannan.\n\n'It\u2019s time we all took more responsibility for how our personal decisions affect the environment,' he added.\n\n'We all have choices in terms of vision correction, whether that\u2019s to wear glasses more often or get laser eye surgery.'\n\n'But whatever you do, don\u2019t throw your contact lenses down the drain.'\n\nA study by contact lens and eye surgery provider Optical Express found that one in four people surveyed threw their lenses down the drain or into the toilet\n\nOf the survey participants, a third said that they were entirely unaware of how their choice of vision correction solution was impacting the environment.\n\nIn response, Optical Express has launched a new program to make their users aware of such environmental issues and offer advice on alternatives to using disposable lenses, such as having eye surgery or wearing glasses more frequently.\n\n'Think of all the plastic that would be saved if the 4.2 million UK contact lens wearers chose to have laser eye surgery,' Mr Hannan commented.\n\n'Contact lenses not only have an environmental impact, but they can be very expensive over the course of a lifetime, and prolonged use increases the risk of eye infections.'\n\n'In the long run, eye surgery is better for the environment, better for your pocket and better for your eyes.'\n\nThe firm is also encouraging users to dispose of their used lenses in an environmentally friendly manner \u2014 with special recycling boxes made available in locations nationwide.\n\nA similar scheme is also offered by Acuvue \u2014 a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson \u2014 via drop-off locations in Boots chemists and other stores across the country.\n\nMicroplastic particles \u2014 which are made as such plastic items as contact lenses, pictured, slowly degrade \u2014 pollute oceans and rivers and have the potential to endanger marine life\n\n'As we all become more environmentally aware and understand the impact on the planet of our decisions and actions, we learn that as consumers, we always have a choice,' said 'Say No To Plastic' campaigner and former broadcaster, Heather Suttie.\n\nMs Suttie \u2014 whose previous campaign work against the use of plastic bags helped lead to the five pence bag levy imposed by the Scottish Government in 2014 \u2014 has now teamed up with Optical Express to tackle plastic contact lens waste.\n\n'Businesses have a responsibility to educate their patients and customers with information on the environmental impact of products and should offer alternative solutions where possible,' she added.\n\n'With 125 million contact lens users worldwide, this is a global crisis and it needs action on a massive scale. Billions of used contact lenses and their packaging are causing widespread pollution and people simply don\u2019t realise the damage.'\n\n'People have been flushing or binning used contact lenses and their packaging for decades, causing untold environmental damage. We need to take action now.'\n\n'It\u2019s great that Optical Express is taking the war on plastic seriously and I hope other eye care providers follow their lead.'\n\n'Through this kind of information and support, all of us can make better informed choices and start cleaning up our oceans and our beaches.'", "description": "Researchers from contact lens supplier\u00a0Optical Express conducted a survey of over 3,000 contact lens wearers in the UK to find out how they disposed of their lenses.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/16/18923808-0-image-a-39_1569424469186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
