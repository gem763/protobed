Another, Cleodie Rickard, 23, who graduated in Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in 2018, said she was \u2018outraged\u2019. The pair are pictured above\n\nAfter an internal investigation, Trinity Hall announced Dr Hutchinson had \u2018withdrawn permanently from any further involvement with college affairs\u2019 and would \u2018not be present in college at any time in the future\u2019.\n\nBut yesterday the college said its statement was \u2018incorrect\u2019 and that Dr Hutchinson would now be allowed back to \u2018attend certain college events\u2019.\n\nThe college said Dr Hutchinson had automatically became an emeritus fellow upon his retirement, which meant he could not be banned from campus after all.\n\nThe archaic rules mean Trinity Hall could have faced legal action from Dr Hutchinson if it did not allow him to return, according to the BBC.\n\nOne of his accusers, Sophie Newbery, 23, who graduated in German and Russian in 2018, said the decision was \u2018a slap in the face\u2019.\n\nAnother, Cleodie Rickard, 23, who graduated in Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in 2018, said she was \u2018outraged\u2019.\n\nBoth women said the college authorities had failed to notify them of its decision.\n\nIn a statement, Trinity Hall said: \u2018Dr Hutchinson will continue to attend certain college events and to exercise his dining rights, but will not attend events primarily aimed at students or alumni except by agreement with the college.\u2019\n\nDr Hutchinson said that there had been \u2018no legal finding of harassment\u2019 by the college authorities and emphasised that it was an internal investigation.\n\nHe was previously cleared of groping a former students in 2005. He admitted at Cambridge Crown Court that he twice patted his accuser on her bottom but denied sexual assaulting her.", "description": "Dr Peter Hutchinson was barred from Trinity Hall in Cambridge and from contacting students in 2017 after a string of allegations were made against him by young women.", "authors": ["Michael Powell For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19941338-0-image-a-62_1571529309967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
