Look Back 200 Years", "language": "en", "text": "Editors\u2019 note: This is part of the Op-Eds From the Future series, in which science fiction authors, futurists, philosophers and scientists write Op-Eds that they imagine we might read 10, 50 or even 200 years from now. The challenges they predict are imaginary \u2014 for now \u2014 but their arguments illuminate the urgent questions of today and prepare us for tomorrow. The opinion piece below is a work of fiction.\n\nWhen you think of communication back in the early 21st century, you probably think of it as the beginnings of the modern phone. But you may not realize that it\u2019s also the origin point for many words and linguistic constructions that we\u2019re still using now, 200 years later. I\u2019ve been using the records at the Internet Archive to research the English of this fascinating historical era, and my research has led me to believe that we should take a more relaxed and curious attitude toward our own language changes in the 23rd century.\n\nFor example, did you know that there was a period between the 17th and the 20th centuries when English didn\u2019t make a distinction between formal and informal ways of addressing someone? Shakespeare distinguished between formal \u201cyou\u201d and informal \u201cthou,\u201d but our presentday distinction between formal \u201cyou\u201d and informal \u201cu\u201d dates back only to the beginning of the internet age. How could people of this unfortunate era have had a true understanding of the Bard when they had no way to fully grasp the intimacy of the sonnets (\u201cshall i compare u to a summer\u2019s day / u are more lovely and more temperate\u201d)?\n\nI was also surprised to learn in my archival research that \u201clol\u201d was once an acronym! Today, we\u2019re all used to it being a simple indicator of double meaning, but it actually once stood for the phrase \u201claughing out loud.\u201d I\u2019ve even seen historic phrases like \u201cit\u2019s lol funny,\u201d which only make sense if we interpret them as \u201cit\u2019s laugh-out-loud funny.\u201d The shift from genuine to aspirational laughter seems to have been well underway by 2001, and the further shift to irony that we\u2019re all familiar with today happened more gradually in the decades after. Strange enough, there are even some records of people spelling it \u201cLOL\u201d or pronouncing it \u201cell oh ell\u201d before it settled on the obvious \u201cloll\u201d pronunciation.", "description": "We should stop worrying that kids these days refuse to say \u201cno worries\u201d in response to \u201cthank you.\u201d", "authors": ["Gretchen Mcculloch"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/sunday/22Mcculloch/22Mcculloch-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
