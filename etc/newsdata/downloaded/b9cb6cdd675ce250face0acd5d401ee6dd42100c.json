He had pled guilty to paying $300,000 to get his daughter into USC.\n\nAccording to a report by NBC News, California Winemaker Agustin Francisco Huneeus has received the longest sentence of any parent involved in the Varsity Blues college bribery scandal.\n\nHuneeus will spend time in prison over his decision to pay $300,000 to have his daughter fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California. Breitbart News reported in September that actress Felicity Huffman had been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her role in the scam. Huffman pled guilty to paying William \u201cRick\u201d Singer to manipulate her daughter\u2019s SAT score with the aid of a bribed exam proctor.\n\nUnlike other parents, Huneeus participated in both parts of the scam. With the aid of William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, Huneeus orchestrated a plan that involved having his daughter\u2019s SAT scores manipulated. Additionally, Huneeus created a fake athletic profile to have his daughter recruited to the university as a water polo player. Although Huneeus\u2019 daughter actually played the sport, investigators concluded that she was not qualified to play at the collegiate level.\n\nPrior to the sentencing, Huneeus told the court that he was eager to pay for his crime, adding that his decision to participate in Singer\u2019s scheme has been \u201cdevastating\u201d to his friends and family.\n\n\u201cToday is a hard day, a super hard day. I want more than anything to pay for my crime and atone for the harm I have caused\u2026 The consequences of my crime have been devastating to my friends and family. I am ashamed.\u201d\n\nDespite his attempt to sound remorseful, prosecutor Justin O\u2019Connell claims that Huneeus knew his actions were wrong from the beginning. \u201cHe knew what he wanted, that was a fraudulent advantage for his daughter. He knew how to get it, and he pushed for that result,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on the Varsity Blues college bribery scam.", "description": "A California winemaker was sentenced to five months in prison over his role in the \"Varsity Blues\" college admissions bribery scandal.
