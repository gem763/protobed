Walshe is a whiz for this kind of thing: she yanks off the plastic veneer of commercial culture by parodying then systematically dismembering the archetypes.

It\u2019s an in-your-face celebration of orchestral virtuosity that references a host of American idioms without ever getting too specific. It\u2019s not his finest orchestral work by any means (those came last century), but an effective, extrovert showpiece.

Photograph: Mark Allan\n\n23 James MacMillan\n\nStabat Mater (2016)\n\nThe prolific Scottish composer has made an impact on choral music, by drawing on his Roman Catholic roots, most recently in his Fifth Symphony, Le grand Inconnu, and in his Tenebrae Responsories. His Stabat Mater for chorus and string orchestra, premiered and commissioned by Harry Christophers and the Sixteen, caught the public imagination, its message direct, immediate, radiant and impassioned.

She leaves space around the material to consider it from this way and that, then sinks in deep. Catlin Smith\u2019s music is slow and quiet but it\u2019s also lush. More than any minimalist, she takes her cues from Couperin, Debussy and the paintings of Agnes Martin. The results are sparse, rugged and sensual; quiet does not have to mean soft. KM\n\nRead our review\n\n21 Max Richter\n\nThe Blue Notebooks (2004)\n\nWritten in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, The Blue Notebooks is Max Richter\u2019s meditation on violence and war, one that was recorded in three hours. The song cycle is linked by narration from Tilda Swinton, but the most compelling pieces don\u2019t require words. Organum is a funereal organ solo, Shadow Journal a piece of ambient house, but the centrepiece is On the Nature of Daylight (since used on countless films and TV soundtracks), where ever-expanding layers of strings are used to heart-tugging effect.

It might blow apart solemn, hard-boiled notions of greatness, but it has to be the most joyous work on this list.

The journey lasts half an hour; it sums up a resolute lifetime of holding the course in bright and heartsore times. Miller is a master of planting a seed and setting in motion an entrancing process, then following through with the most sumptuous conviction.

An ingenious reworking of Shakespeare (libretto by Matthew Jocelyn) which opens with a fragmented \u201cTo be, or not to be\u2026\u201d, it was premiered at Glyndebourne in 2017 with Allan Clayton in the title role and Barbara Hannigan as Ophelia.

Photograph: Mark Allan\n\n17 Steve Reich\n\nWTC 9/11 (2011)\n\nIt took the quintessential New York composer a full 10 years to process the horrors of September 11 and compose this dissonant threnody, one that sets Reich\u2019s sawing strings against manipulated voices. The recordings of horrified air traffic controllers and eyewitnesses are spliced and looped, the tonalities of their speech replicated (sometimes almost mockingly) by the Kronos Quartet, before we reach a closure of sorts with a cantor\u2019s prayer.

Composed in collaboration with the soprano Juliet Fraser, Skin takes inspiration from Samuel Beckett, turning the writer\u2019s image of dust as \u201cthe skin of a room\u201d into a 25-minute evisceration of the sounds that the soloist and ensemble can make. Saunders burrows into the interior world of the instruments, and inside the grain of Fraser\u2019s voice \u2013 scrapes and screams, breaths and sighs \u2013 and finds a revelatory world of heightened feeling.

Extracts from Andersen\u2019s story and from St Matthew\u2019s gospel are interleaved with closely woven vocal writing, that is sometimes unaccompanied, sometimes punctuated by discreet percussion and often comfortingly tonal and hauntingly affecting.

The score subtly alludes to Monteverdi and French baroque, but the sound world it creates is uniquely Dusapin\u2019s own: tense, quietly mesmerising and austerely beautiful.

An immersive production, staged by the English National Opera at the Young Vic, used film, a chirruping electro-acoustic score and the terrifying, androgynous voice of David Moss to further confuse things.

But the work for Cello is perhaps the most original and entertainingly disconcerting of all of them, cast in four brilliant movements that never quite conform to type, while doing everything expected of a concerto, in a fresh and unconventional way.

But somehow, it brilliantly captures the play\u2019s absurdities while adding a layer of surrealism that is entirely Barry\u2019s own.

But Adams\u2019s intention is much more than mere description \u2013 it\u2019s a warning of what lies ahead for us and our seas if we do not care for them.

But, as often in his theatre pieces, the most unlikely ingredients cohere magically, creating a witty, allusive dramatic world unlike any other, with the 1960s sounds counterpointing Stein\u2019s rambling surrealism. AC\n\nRead our review | Listen to a recording on YouTube\n\n8 Jonathan Harvey\n\nString Quartet No 4 (2003)\n\nFor live electronics and string quartet, this 2003 work is written in cycles rather than movements, with an idea of dying away, renewal and continuation. Harvey experiments with technology to discover new aural possibilities and keep the traditional form alive. He wrote all his quartets for the Arditti, knowing they would meet every challenge he put before them. The result is eloquent and lyrical.

A Hartley film was part of the original staging, but Andriessen\u2019s wonderfully polyglot score, with its host of historical references and exuberant embrace of jazz and folk music, stands on its own.

Based on La Vida breve by Jaufre Rudel, with a libretto by French-Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, the music has medieval and Middle Eastern echoes but shimmers in Saariaho\u2019s own distinctive and mesmerising voice.FM\n\nRead our review | Listen on Spotify\n\n5 Thomas Ad\u00e8s\n\nThe Tempest (2003)\n\nIt starts with a geometric storm and ends with a consolatory chaconne. Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s The Tempest was the catalyst for his creation of a musical language that is at once richly familiar and beguilingly strange. It was a piece that immediately fulfilled expectations for what Ad\u00e8s would do with the full resources of the Royal Opera House when it premiered in 2004 \u2013 and transcended them.

An austere, utterly faithful rendering of the original, mostly delivered in recitative, and reinforced with typically terse, wiry orchestral writing. It is a distillation of the uncompromisingly direct music that Kurt\u00e1g has composed all through his career.

His death scene, created especially for the bass John Tomlinson, is a majestic operatic set piece, the climax of a work in which the eruptions of orchestral violence are offset by music of lyrical beauty and pungent transparency.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\n2 George Benjamin\n\nWritten on Skin (2012)\n\nGeorge Benjamin\u2019s first full-scale opera, with words by Martin Crimp, arrived in 2012 seemingly timeless in every way, its ultimately gruesome story told grippingly to a modern audience through Benjamin\u2019s tense, precise and often glowingly beautiful score. Katie Mitchell\u2019s thoughtful staging was only the start: no opera since has had so many different productions in so many theatres. EJ\n\nRead our review | Watch a production\n\n1 Hans Abrahamsen\n\nLet Me Tell You (2013)\n\nWhen the 21st century began, the idea that Hans Abrahamsen would compose one of the masterpieces of the next 20 years would have seemed extraordinary. At that time very little of his music had been heard for almost a decade \u2013 he had suffered a creative block that he\u2019s since described as being \u201cparalysed by the white paper\u201d, and from which he eventually rescued himself by composing a series of arrangements, both of his own earlier scores and of pieces by others, including Bach and Debussy.\n\n\n\nBorn in 1952 in Copenhagen, Abrahamsen had begun his career as a member of a group of young Danish composers who reacted against what they saw as the overcomplexity of the European new music they heard and who sought a much simpler style. He explored minimalism and studied for a while with Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, and soon established himself as one of the younger European composers to watch, his works championed in the 1980s by conductor/composers such as Hans Werner Henze and Oliver Knussen. After early success came a long silence \u2013 he completed just one short piece in eight years, but he did return to composition with the piano concerto that he finished in 2000, in which he started to invent for himself a totally original and utterly personal sound world.\n\n\n\nThis list could just as easily be headed by the work that first exploited this newly invented world, Schnee, an extraordinary hour-long ensemble piece from 2008, as by the ravishing orchestral song cycle Let Me Tell You that followed it five years later. The intricate symmetries and microtonally tinged canons of Schnee define the icy, fragile world that Abrahamsen had been mapping out for himself, and which went on to provide the perfect environment for the settings of extracts from Paul Griffiths\u2019s novel of the same name that he made for the songs.\n\n\n\nLike Griffiths\u2019s book, Let Me Tell You is a portrait of Ophelia, but one that tells her story from her perspective rather than from the way she is portrayed in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. It\u2019s an operatic scene as much as a song cycle, one of soaring lines and shivering pianissimos, and which makes use of the stuttering repetitions, stile concitato, that Monteverdi introduced into opera four centuries ago to signify anger or anxiety. The vocal writing is astonishingly assured. It is hard to believe this was Abrahamsen\u2019s first large scale vocal work, and it seems perfectly tailored to the soprano Barbara Hannigan, for whom it was conceived, and for her precious ability to soar ethereally and effortlessly above the sometimes forbidding, sometimes ravishingly beautiful soundscapes that the orchestra creates beneath her. There is the feeling, Hannigan has said of the cycle: \u201cThe music\u2019s always been there,\u201d and the sense of there being something timeless and utterly inevitable about Let Me Tell You gives it a very special power.
