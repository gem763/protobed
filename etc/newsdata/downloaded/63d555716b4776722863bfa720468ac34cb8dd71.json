I can\u2019t recall a time ever that its has been so stressful and difficult to be a law enforcement officer,\u201d said Officer Sherri Martin of the Enfield, Connecticut, police department and chair of the national officer wellness committee of the Fraternal Order of Police.\n\nAmong the police officers who have ended their lives in recent weeks:\n\n\u2981 Montgomery County Police Officer Thomas Bomba, 38, requested backup Monday for a report of disorderly conduct at a parking garage in Silver Spring, Maryland. When officers arrived, they found Officer Bomba suffering from a gunshot wound. He died later at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center.\n\nThe chief medical examiner for the District of Columbia announced Tuesday that the 13-year veteran of the Montgomery County force died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n\u2981 An off-duty sergeant for the New York City Police Department fatally shot himself in his home in the Fresh Meadows neighborhood of Queens on Tuesday. He was the 10th officer the department lost this year to suicide.\n\n\u201cWe vow to keep fighting this fight, to do better on these and many other fronts, and to put a stop to this epidemic once and for all,\u201d said NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neil.\n\n\u2981 An off-duty Chicago police officer was found dead last month in a forest in an apparent suicide, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nThe newspaper said the officer\u2019s death was the fourth suicide by a Chicago officer this year and the eighth since July 2018. Days later, a retired Chicago police officer fatally shot himself in his home, the Tribune reported.\n\n\u2018A sense of hopelessness\u2019\n\nThomas Coghlan is a retired NYPD police detective who served for 21 years on the force before becoming a clinical psychologist specializing in assessments and therapy for first responders. He identified four types of stressors that can affect a police officer\u2019s mental health:\n\n\u2981 Operational: responding to traumatic incidents such a fatal wreck, homicide or domestic violence.\n\n\u2981 Occupational: such as mandatory overtime, scheduling or missing family time.\n\n\u2981 Organizational: an agency\u2019s punitive policies against officers or treating them as liabilities rather than assets.\n\n\u2981 Situational: such as a divorce or an illness in the family.\n\nMr. Coghlan said a lack of reciprocity on the job can contribute to hopelessness, a \u201ckey contributing factor to suicidal thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may love the job, but the job will never love you, and that\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficers can become disillusioned by the job and how their department treats them, which can begin a downward turn toward hopelessness, he said.\n\nAs officers work in the department for years, they begin to realize how the agency treats them doesn\u2019t improve, Mr. Coghlan said.\n\n\u201cIf today is the best there is, and it will never get better \u2014 in fact it will always get worse \u2014 it can develop into a sense of hopelessness,\u201d Mr. Coghlan said. \u201cHopelessness informs suicidal thinking.\u201d\n\nTerrence Cunningham, deputy executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, compared the stress that officers experience to carrying a heavy load without assistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like putting bricks in a backpack and at some point the backpack gets too heavy and it needs help,\u201d said Mr. Cunningham, a former police chief in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nHelping police officers\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police conducted a national study on the emotional health of 8,000 officers across the country. It found that 79% reported experiencing critical stress at some point during their career, which they defined as \u201ca strong emotional reaction that overwhelms usually effective coping abilities.\u201d Of that, 69% said it caused lingering emotional issues.\n\nA fifth of the respondents said they use counseling through their agencies\u2019 employee assistance program.\n\nThe survey found that a significant number use coping mechanisms like talking with friends and family, exercising, or picking up a hobby for distraction, but many resort to self-medication with alcohol or substances or doing nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWhen they are undiagnosed and untreated, and very frequently self-medicating, they represent a very high level of risk, and when they are treated represent a low level of risk,\u201d Mr. Coghlan said.\n\nOfficer Martin of the FOP\u2019s wellness committee noted that police officers\u2019 schedules often don\u2019t promote healthy habits. When officers work late-night shifts, for example, the only dining options available are often fast food.\n\nShe said officers monitor one another when someone on the force is unwell, but an officer\u2019s mental health rarely poses a threat to the public.\n\nMr. Cunningham of the International Association of Chiefs of Police said \u201cpeople are finally starting to realize we have got to knock down the stigma and change the entire culture. The whole profession has to be healthier.\u201d\n\nIn Montgomery County, the police department \u201chas a Crisis Response and Support Unit that provides peer support to both sworn and professional staff,\u201d county council President Nancy Navarro\u2019s office said in an email. \u201cStress counseling services are also offered to the police through the County\u2019s Office of Human Resources to provide appropriate confidentiality.\u201d\n\nIn New York, Commissioner O\u2019Neill established a health and wellness task force, whose initiatives include health and wellness training for command-level officers and a peer support program.\n\nAdditionally, the FOP is developing a nationwide program to train officers to be peer support counselors, which survey respondents said is the most helpful. It also is creating a directory of counseling providers who are familiar with the work of first responders.\n\nOfficer Martin said some legislatures have passed measures to allow for post-traumatic stress disorder to be included in workers\u2019 compensation policies.\n\nShe said some departments require every officer to have a yearly check-in with a mental health professional, which reduces the stigma and helps officers build trust with counselors.\n\nMr. Coghlan said that in many cases, an agency\u2019s discipline policy mimics its mental health policy, so they revisit how they treat people who seek help.\n\n\u201cI believe you need to address the issue of stigma and why officers are so resistant to voluntarily seeking treatment,\u201d Mr. Coghlan said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
