In addition, online messaging applications have been disrupted to thwart further protests. The Egyptian government has also sent advisory warnings to foreign reporters on how they must cover the protests.\n\nCivil society groups, including the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, said so far 1,003 people had been arrested including prominent academics.\n\nJohnson and Sisi held their bilateral meeting on the margins of the UN general assembly hours before the UK hosted a high-profile event designed to drive home its support for a campaign to develop new laws that will defend journalists\u2019 rights.\n\nBut the president\u2019s spokesman Bassam Radi reported after the meeting with Johnson that the UK was \u201ckeen to praise Egypt\u2019s economic performance noting that the Egyptian economy is witnessing an obvious improvement\u201d.\n\nThe presidential spokesperson also said the two leaders discussed efforts to curb terrorism and extremism, enhancing the exchange of information and preventing funding for terrorist activities.\n\nContractor, actor \u2026 protest leader? The Egyptian exile driving rare dissent Read more\n\nThe bland Downing Street read-out of the meeting also made no mention of the crackdown on protests. It simply said \u201cthe leaders recalled their constructive meeting at the G7 Summit in Biarritz and reconfirmed their commitment to work together to build on the positive progress in our bilateral relationship\u201d.\n\nIt added \u201cThey discussed our two countries\u2019 economic ties and the importance of building on this after the UK leaves the EU\u201d.\n\nOfficials said the media crackdown may have been raised privately with Sisi. But the absence of any criticism of the assault on press freedom in the read-out raises questions about whether the UK government is willing to hold repressive autocrats to account in public about issues of media freedom, especially if commercial ties might be threatened.\n\nPressed at the media freedom summit in New York on whether ministers are prepared to make its case directly to resistant world leaders, Lord Ahmad, the human rights minister, said the UK government often raised human rights issues in private as well as public. He insisted this private pressure had an effect.\n\nThe UK held a high-profile media freedom conference in the summer and Clooney, a champion of threatened journalists, has helped established a high-level panel of legal experts to examine what global laws are needed to defend press freedom globally.\n\nAt the meeting in New York, Ahmad reaffirmed the UK\u2019s intention, after Brexit, to establish a UK global human rights sanctions regime to hold those who commit serious violations of human rights to account, including when journalists, whistleblowers and human rights defenders are targeted. He said a statutory instrument would be introduced as soon as possible.\n\nClooney, the leading lawyer defending journalists under threat, said: \u201cIf democracy is to have any chance of survival we need leaders who believe in liberal values to step up.\u201d\n\nTrump's rhetoric 'makes journalists vulnerable to abuse', says Amal Clooney Read more\n\nShe said journalists were made incredibly vulnerable by the rising drumbeat of senior officials vilifying the media and creating a toxic environment.\n\nShe said the current international treaties defending freedom of expression were ineffective, adding the team of senior legal experts created two months ago and chaired by former supreme court president Lord Neuberger set up by the UK Foreign Office was drawing up model laws needed to embed a genuine free press.\n\nShe favours five new tools including targeted sanctions regimes, freezing bank accounts and entry bans against state officials that abuse media freedom, deployment of a team of international lawyers capable of investigating attacks, a commitment to transparency when a journalist is arrested, enhanced consular advice and a system of visas for reporters suffering persecution.", "description": "Banning of BBC and crackdown on protests seemingly not on agenda at PM\u2019s talks with Sisi", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be35c944ef177fec0d8824ffe2fcfd02d45f20f8/126_299_1789_1074/master/1789.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bed13de786bb2e2f2f737513b6c7e20", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
