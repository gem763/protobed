They\u2019re scattered among our emerging technologies and industrial sectors.\n\nIts nationals, agents and moles steal American intellectual property. Its companies buy or invest in U.S. firms in key economic sectors.\n\nIt forces American companies to transfer their IP and proprietary technology, as well as enter joint ventures with domestic entities (some state-owned, others state-subsidized) as the price of access to that country\u2019s market.\n\nThe country\u2019s government centrally runs its economy. Its government picks winners and losers. State-subsidized companies there don\u2019t actually have to compete with foreign rivals because the former are in their government\u2019s hip pocket.\n\nIt\u2019s China, right? Today, yes, but also Japan.\n\nJapan\u2019s mercantilist, protectionist, industrial policy model, with its economic rising sun referred in the 1970s and \u201880s as Japan Inc., amounted to \u201cthe same systematic industrial planning that Japan had used to guide its economy during the war,\u201d economist Pat Choate notes.\n\nChina has paid attention.\n\nForeign central planners have targeted sectors such as automobiles, computers, electronics and manufacturing. Their expropriation of American IP, trade barriers blocking Western competitors and currency manipulation to make their exports cheaper have dulled America\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nChina and other foreign competitors play dirty pool to put our technologies and products into their industrial favorites\u2019 hands. Commonly, foreign governments demand U.S. innovators to license their inventions at bargain-basement rates or else the foreign government denies access to its market, while domestic firms make and sell the stolen technology without having to pay U.S. owners a licensing fee or royalties.\n\nRecently, the Trump administration designated China as a currency manipulator. Indeed, it is. And we shouldn\u2019t lose sight that Japan directly intervened in currency markets, devaluing the yen against the dollar, 376 times between 1991 and 2016.\n\nAs a result of systematic cheating, American-born industries, including key manufacturing sectors like textiles, semiconductors and machine tools, have been hollowed out here and been displaced by other countries\u2019 national champions. The foreign firms directly benefit from central industrial planning and official scale-tilting; unfair competitive practices that back domestic industry players; massive trade deficits; mafia-grade IP expropriation and strong-arm tactics; weaponizing \u201ccompetition\u201d laws to injure American firms; and denying due process.\n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of setting slugging records powered by steroids \u2014 institutionalized cheating. Such underhanded misconduct advantages companies such as Huawei and ZTE, the Chinese telecom giants.\n\n\u201cThe countries outcompeting us [have] . . . comprehensive trade strategies and everyone pulling together,\u201d Sen. Ernest Hollings said. And they don\u2019t hesitate to break the rules of fair competition.\n\nThis foreign freeloading and outright theft erodes America\u2019s industrial competitiveness. Such lack of respect for the rule of law and fair competition hurts U.S. economic and national security. It robs millions of Americans across the country of good-paying jobs that don\u2019t require their collegiate indebtedness.\n\nThe United States is a rules-based society. Our strengths include private property rights, the rule of law and a free enterprise economy that rewards innovation and private risk-taking. Our regulatory burden is heavier than it should be, but hardly equal to the economic effects of favoritism practiced overseas.\n\nUncle Sam doesn\u2019t pick winners and losers. Successful American companies aren\u2019t state-owned or politically favored national champions. U.S. firms answer to owners and investors who may freely vote with their wallets.\n\nThus, if America is to lead the world in cutting-edge technologies like 5G wireless connectivity, artificial intelligence, biopharmaceuticals, medical devices and self-driving vehicles and retain robust industrial sectors in these fields, we must play to our strengths.\n\nPresident Reagan took measures to mitigate the Japanese economic threat. Reagan secured voluntary antidumping restraints on steel, autos, semiconductors and machine tools. His administration won a foothold for U.S. access to certain Japanese markets and got Japanese manufacturers to build U.S.-based plants. His Plaza Accord weakened the dollar against the yen to counter Japan\u2019s currency manipulation and reduce the trade deficit.\n\nReagan also convened a Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. The commission identified innovation as our competitive edge and the cornerstone of our economic success and competitiveness. \u201cInnovation spurs new industries and revives mature ones,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Young Commission viewed secure intellectual property as integral to private sector innovation. IP boosts research-and-development investment and a diverse, flourishing U.S. manufacturing sector to commercialize R&D\u2019s fruits.\n\n\u201cWhen intellectual property rights are fully protected under the law \u2014 in the same way that tangible property is \u2014 the competitive edge that U.S. industries gain from new technologies is preserved,\u201d the commission said.\n\nOnly with secure IP rights can U.S. firms maintain technological superiority in advanced technologies and the American lead in areas like 5G. U.S. medical device and pharmaceutical companies need IP rights to discover and develop new therapies and cures.\n\nThe president should create a new commission on industrial competitiveness for the 21st century. Its members should be the patent owners, business leaders and venture capitalists in cutting-edge technological fields.\n\nBottom line, securing patents and IP, along with the U.S. government having our companies\u2019 backs against foreign trade cheating and institutionalized IP theft, will determine whether America or another country prospers from our innovation.", "description": "Quick, name that country:Ranks of researchers come study or work .10/25/2019 19:51:18PM EST.", "authors": ["James Edwards", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/95/079b9347-782d-4dd9-ac90-28dbf8ca5a7e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
