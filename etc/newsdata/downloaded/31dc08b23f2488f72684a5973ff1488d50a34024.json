The country's banking association said banks would remain closed until stability is restored, amid growing fears that a rush to withdraw savings when they reopen could deplete dwindling foreign currency deposits.\n\nSeparately, Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh said in a statement on Sunday that currency exchangers must be licensed by the central bank to move funds, do it through licensed companies or apply for a licence.\n\n\"Then there are no restrictions on the amounts shipped and there is no need to request prior authorisation,\" the central bank statement said.\n\n\"The Lebanese exchange market will remain a free market in accordance with the current [central bank] laws and circulars. The BDL will not issue any new circular on this subject,\" it said.\n\nAs protests grip the country, Lebanon's banking association has held meetings in recent days in search of a way to reopen banks without triggering a run on deposits.\n\nThe historic wave of protests in Lebanon is targeted against political leaders blamed for corruption and steering the country towards economic collapse. There is no sign of moves towards a compromise between the government and protesters, whose demands include its resignation.\n\nLebanon, where the Lebanese pound currency is pegged to the dollar, is one of the world's most heavily indebted states.\n\nCapital inflows needed to finance the state deficit and pay for imports have been slowing down, generating financial pressures not seen in decades, including the emergence of a parallel market for dollars.
