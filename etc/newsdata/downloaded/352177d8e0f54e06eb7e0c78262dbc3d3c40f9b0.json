It\u2019s amazing how there are so many positive ones yet our human nature self has us focus on the negative.\u2019\n\n\u2018You are a master at clap back!!! I love it!\u2019 said another follower who was clearly excited by the entertainment.\n\nRiRi\u2019s been blessing us with her greatness recently (Picture: Rihanna, Instagram)\n\nDrawing on their own experience, another said: \u2018Girl you are BOMB I\u2019ve always got teased because of My forehead too but it never stopped my beauty brains or income I love how you wear your real hair too..bild beautiful and fancy [sic].\u2019\n\nThe troll wasn\u2019t the only person sliding into Rihanna\u2019s comments.\n\nRiRi gave her 76.4 million followers a surprise over the weekend when she shared yet another Fenty Beauty promo video with a Chris Brown song playing in the background.\n\nThe pair split in 2009 following a domestic violence incident that saw Chris, 30, plead guilty to felony assault.\n\nBut clearly both have moved on from the horrific incident and Chris responded to Rihanna\u2019s support of his music by reposting her video and adding the prayer hands and love heart emojis.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
