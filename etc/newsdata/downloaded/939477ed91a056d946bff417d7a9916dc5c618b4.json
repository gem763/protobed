One White House official described this act as an abuse of the electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nIt is also alleged that Mr Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, \u201cis a central figure in this effort\u201d, and that the attorney-general, William Barr, \u201cappears to be involved as well\u201d.\n\nThe official, who reportedly is a senior member of the US intelligence community, said several other state department and intelligence community officials \u201cwere also briefed on the contents of the call\u201d.\n\nThe whistleblower acknowledges they were not a \u201cdirect witness to most of the events described\u201d, but says they heard from over half a dozen US officials whose accounts they found to be \u201ccredible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
