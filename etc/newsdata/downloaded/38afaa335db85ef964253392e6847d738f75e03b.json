He is being held at Liberty County Jail in Hinesville, Ga. An arraignment hearing in Cleveland is scheduled for Sept. 13, according to court records.\n\nAccording to WSAV-TV in Savannah, Ga., on Aug. 14 the Liberty County Sheriff\u2019s Office received a request from investigators in Cleveland for a sample of Biles-Thomas\u2019s DNA. A cheek-swab test was conducted and the results were presented to a grand jury, which then returned an indictment.\n\nPolice and prosecutors in Ohio say a group of people showed up uninvited to a New Year\u2019s Eve party at a Cleveland apartment above a pizzeria that was being rented as an Airbnb. After being asked to leave, a fight broke out and someone in the group started firing a gun at around 11:30 p.m. Devaughn Gibson, a 23-year-old barber; DelVaunte Johnson, a 19-year-old student; and Toshon Banks, a 21-year-old laborer, died of multiple gunshot wounds. Two other people were shot but survived.\n\nAccording to online court records, Biles-Thomas was charged with six counts of murder (three for directly causing another person\u2019s death and three for causing someone\u2019s death during the commission of a separate felony), three counts of voluntary manslaughter, five counts of felonious assault and one count of perjury. No one else has been charged.\n\nBecause of their mother\u2019s drug and alcohol addictions, Biles and her three siblings lived in foster care until they were adopted by relatives. When she was 6, the future four-time Olympic gold medalist and her younger sister were adopted by their grandfather in Texas; Biles-Thomas and another sister were adopted by a great-aunt in Cleveland.\n\nRead more on the Olympic sports:\n\nChristian Coleman cleared after USADA withdraws doping charges\n\nA Paralympic rower drowned after his boat capsized in training.
