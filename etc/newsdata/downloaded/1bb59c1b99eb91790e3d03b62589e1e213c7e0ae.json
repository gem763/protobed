It said: \"The Duchess of Sussex had worked with Peter in the past and personally chose him to shoot the 15 women on the cover.\n\n\"There is no other photographer she considered to bring this meaningful project to life.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Lindbergh was known for his photographs of models Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford.\n\nLindbergh studied at Berlin's Academy of Fine Arts in the 1960s. He assisted German photographer Hans Lux for two years before opening his own studio in 1973.\n\nHe moved to Paris in 1978 to pursue his career, his website says.\n\nThe photographer's work appeared in magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Harper's Bazaar and The New Yorker.\n\nImage copyright Peter Lindbergh\n\nHe preferred to capture his models naturally, telling Vogue earlier this year: \"I hate retouching. I hate make-up. I always say: 'Take the make-up off!'\"\n\nEdward Enninful, editor of UK Vogue said: \"His ability to see real beauty in people, and the world, was ceaseless, and will live on through the images he created. He will be missed by everyone who knew him, worked with him or loved his pictures.\"\n\nHis work was shown in museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.\n\nLindbergh also directed a number of films and documentaries. His film Inner Voices won best documentary at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2000.\n\nCelebrities who have worked with Lindbergh paid tribute to him on Twitter.\n\nMusician Mika described the photographer as an \"extraordinary man and talent\".", "description": "The German photographer will be remembered for his dramatic black and white portraits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/864C/production/_108608343_mediaitem108608340.jpg"}
