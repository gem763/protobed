This trend appears to have abated in 2016 and global inequality is now likely to edge downward in the immediate future.\"\n\nOverall, global wealth also grew over the past year by 2.6%, reaching the new high of $360 trillion. If divided equally, that would mean there is approximately $70,850 per adult in the world.", "description": "The Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report shows that millionaires own 44% of the total wealth in the world.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/millionaires-stock-gty-aa-191022_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
