The 44th president was born in Hawaii and his birth certificate proves it.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s taste for scurrilous and malicious untruths has come back to bite him. The US president is facing an impeachment inquiry that could remove him from office, precisely because of his relentless pursuit of conspiracy theories.\n\nHere are the five such theories that lie at the heart of the Ukraine scandal:\n\n1. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor, to shield his son Hunter\n\nThis goes right to the core of the impeachment inquiry, as it speaks to the \u201curgent concern\u201d raised by a whistleblower in the intelligence services. According to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, Trump repeatedly urged the Ukrainian government to investigate the former vice-president, in the hope of gathering dirt on someone who stands a good chance of contesting next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTrump\u2019s theory begins with a truth: in 2016 Biden withheld $1bn in loan guarantees from Ukraine in order to winkle out its then chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. The prosecutor, Trump\u2019s story goes on less accurately, was busily investigating Hunter Biden, the vice-president\u2019s second son, who was a paid board member of a large Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.\n\nTwo and two makes five: Joe Biden, Trump concluded, was corruptly interfering in Ukraine in order to protect his son.\n\nThere are problems with this narrative. The Burisma investigation was dormant when Biden pushed for Shokin to be fired. And Biden was not alone in wanting Shokin out: several European governments and authorities including the IMF also pressed for his dismissal, because of his dire record on fighting corruption.\n\n2. Hunter Biden was up to his neck in corruption\n\nThere is no doubt the younger Biden\u2019s appointment at Burisma in April 2014 was curious, to put it politely. He had no expertise in the gas industry and it is hard to avoid the thought his main attraction was his bloodline.\n\nBut the move was not illegal and his father has stated that the pair never discussed business. In May, the then prosecutor general of Ukraine told Bloomberg there was no evidence either Biden did anything wrong.\n\nThen, as now, there was no law or regulation preventing children or other relatives of powerful public figures pursuing lucrative business opportunities.\n\nAsk Billy Carter, brother of Jimmy Carter; Hillary Clinton\u2019s brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham; and George W Bush\u2019s brother Neil. As Vox has pointed out, all raised eyebrows by engaging in business dealings when their relative was in high office. To that list you might add three other presidential children: Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka Trump.\n\n3. The whistleblower is biased\n\nTrump has repeatedly smeared the individual he calls the \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d and \u201c#FakeWhistleblower\u201d, questioning his or her patriotism and motivations.\n\nA whole new conspiracy theory has emerged. Trump has tweeted a link to an article by the rightwing website the Federalist that suggests foul play on the grounds that Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower\u2019s attorney, interned for leading Democrats Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior adviser, told Fox News Sunday: \u201cI know the difference between a whistleblower and a deep state operative.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, very little is known about the whistleblower\u2019s political beliefs. The inspector general of the intelligence community, the first to receive the complaint, did find \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias\u201d.\n\nBut he concluded that the allegations \u201cappeared credible\u201d. Furthermore, the general counsel in the office of the director of national intelligence stated: \u201cWe have every reason to believe that [the whistleblower] has acted in good faith.\u201d\n\nIn a related theory, the Federalist also reported that shortly before the Ukraine complaint was filed, the US intelligence community \u201csecretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings\u201d. The report, embraced by conservative media figures Trump is known to follow, has been debunked.\n\n4. \u2018CrowdStrike\u2019\n\nThis is the most bizarre of all Trump\u2019s Ukraine fantasies. To put it briefly: Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity company hired by the Democratic National Committee to look into a massive hack of emails during the 2016 election, was in cahoots with key Democrats and collectively framed Russia as the source of the theft.\n\nIn fact, the theory goes, the DNC server was not hacked by Russia but was hidden in Ukraine. The whole Russia line was a ruse to besmirch Trump and help Clinton.\n\nRelease of Trump-Putin transcripts needs Russian approval, Kremlin says Read more\n\nThere are so many fallacies in the theory it is hard to know where to begin. There is no one DNC server and it is not hidden in Ukraine. Russia was confirmed as the source of the hacked emails by US intelligence agencies, the justice department and the FBI.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump\u2019s first homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert \u2013 no deep state Democrat he \u2013 told ABC the idea Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in 2016 was \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d and \u201chas no validity\u201d.\n\n5. George Soros is behind it all\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who is now Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has repeatedly touted the idea that the billionaire philanthropist was the financier and mastermind behind Democratic dirty dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros was behind it, George Soros\u2019 company was funding it,\u201d Giuliani told ABC, referring to the related conspiracy theory that Ukraine colluded with Clinton.\n\nSoros has been a favourite target of virulent rightwing conspiracy theories dating back to the early 1990s, many with antisemitic undertones.\n\nThe Soros-Ukraine narrative has been widely discredited. An investigation by the Daily Beast found it to be \u201cflimsy\u201d and based \u201calmost entirely on innuendos\u201d.", "description": "The US president is facing an impeachment inquiry directly related to his relentless pursuit of malicious untruths", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington", "Laurence H Tribe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b0baa39047cbc00169d67b68e7677ffe0e9ef33/0_383_5751_3451/master/5751.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ace3b764b6791f1949fe9e1bbf31ae6f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
