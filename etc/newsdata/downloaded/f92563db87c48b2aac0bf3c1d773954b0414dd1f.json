These cards offer increased rewards on entertainment events and exclusive access to presales, premium seating and venue lounges. Below, CNBC Select takes an in-depth look at three of the best credit cards for entertainment spending as well as the added entertainment perks issuers provide to all cardholders, regardless of whether you have an entertainment rewards card.\n\nHow entertainment rewards credit cards work\n\nEntertainment rewards credit cards offer bonus rewards on all your entertainment related purchases, whether that's concerts, plays, movies or sporting events \u2014 in some cases even streaming services. Bonus rewards means a cardholder earns a minimum of 2% cash back or 2X points per dollar spent. The Capital One\u00ae Savor\u00ae Rewards Credit Card offers 4% cash back on entertainment, which is one of the highest rewards rates available. This card tops our list of the best credit cards for entertainment spending since you can earn an estimated $129 in rewards on entertainment related purchases each year, assuming an average $3,221 annual spend on entertainment (from a sample budget created by location intelligence firm Esri). The Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express offers a high 6% cash back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions, which include popular services like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify and Prime Video Unlimited. And if you want to save at movie theaters and on TV, internet and streaming services (which includes 15 providers such as Comcast, Apple Music and Hulu), the U.S. Bank Cash+\u2122 Visa Signature\u00ae offers 5% cash back on two bonus categories each quarter, on your first $2,000 in combined eligible net purchases, then 1%. So, you can select both categories and benefit from increased rewards. Depending on what type of rewards credit card you have \u2014 cash back, points or miles \u2014 you can redeem rewards for statement credit, gift cards, travel, merchandise and more.\n\nHow to maximize your perks and rewards\n\nEntertainment rewards credit cards often offer enhanced perks for various events and may even offer elevated rewards. In addition to 4% cash back on entertainment, the Capital One\u00ae Savor\u00ae Rewards Credit Card offers cardholders who buy tickets through Vivid Seats, a ticket resale site, 8% cash back (through May 31, 2020), which is double what you'd typically earn.\n\nHow to get exclusive entertainment experiences\n\nBeyond entertainment-specific credit cards, many card issuers and networks also provide access to exclusive entertainment events, ticket presales, premium seating, lounge access and more. To take advantage of these perks, you simply need to be a cardholder.
