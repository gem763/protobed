All customers currently abroad with Thomas Cook who are booked to return to the UK over the next 2 weeks will be brought home as close as possible to their booked return date,\" it said in a statement. According to the Guardian, the government is also relying on other British airlines such as Virgin and easyJet to ferry people home.\n\nSpeaking on his arrival in New York this morning for the U.N. General Assembly, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised the government would do its \u201clevel best\u201d to get people home on time, and hinted at future measures to ensure travel company bosses do more to avoid financial risk.\n\n\u201cOne is driven to reflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivized to sort such matters out,\u201d the PM said. He also revealed that the government had rejected a request from Thomas Cook for a bailout because doing so would have set up a \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nThomas Cook has struggled to cope with a \u00a31.7 billion debt burden. An 11th-hour meeting on Sunday between company executives and stakeholders did not lead to a solution, according to the Guardian.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook will also prove hugely costly to the U.K. taxpayer, with compensation payouts guaranteed to all customers who had booked holiday packages through the firm. Some estimates quoted by the Guardian put the total cost \u2014 including the mass repatriation \u2014 as high as \u00a3600 million.\n\nHowever Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today program this morning: \"We know that the Monarch [Airlines] rescue was about \u00a350 million, and we know that this is about 50 percent bigger. This is the biggest peacetime reparation, so it gives your a sort of indication [of the cost].\"\n\nHe added that Thomas Cook had asked for a bailout of \u00a3250 million that the government had rejected in the early hours of the morning. \"I fear it would have kept them [afloat] for a short period of time and then would have been back in the position to repatriate people in any case. The problems the company has are systemic.\"\n\nLabour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell criticized the government response on the same show, saying the government should have stepped in to help, with \"strings attached,\" following the \u201cmanagement failure\u201d at the travel firm, owing to the thousands of jobs at risk and the threat to people's holidays.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "The liquidation puts 9,000 British jobs in jeopardy and leaves 150,000 Brits stranded around the world.", "authors": ["Sanya Khetani-Shah", "Ian Geoghegan"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176354663-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
