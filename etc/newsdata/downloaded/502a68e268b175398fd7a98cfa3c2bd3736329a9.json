Sometimes I'll have my Kissed Earth Cleanse,' Rachael said.\n\n'It depends how I feel and what my body wants. But hydration is key.'\n\nAt 7am, it's time for Rachael's coffee - which comes in the form of 'collagen coffee' - she makes this with black coffee, almond milk, Kissed Earth collagen, mushrooms and maca powder\n\nWhat is Rachael's morning routine? * 6am: Wakes up. * 6.15am: Large glass of water with apple cider vinegar and lemon water. * 6.20am: Heads outside for brief dog walk. * 6.30am: 20 minutes of Vedic practice meditation in the park or at home. * 7am: Collagen coffee made from black coffee, almond milk, Kissed Earth collagen, mushrooms and maca powder blended. * 7.30am: Makes kids' breakfast and packs Violet's school lunch.\n\nFollowing her water, Rachael said that at 6.20am she will head outside to walk her dog, Simba, briefly.\n\nBut her dog walk isn't like every other dog walk.\n\nOnce she is out and about in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, Rachael said she will 'swing my arms and do weird things to wake up my body'.\n\n'At 6.30, I do 20 minutes of Vedic practice meditation,' she said.\n\nSometimes this is in the park, and sometimes it's at home on the sofa while the rest of her family sleeps.\n\nVedic Meditation is a technique dating back thousands of years in India.\n\nPractitioners use a mantra - a word or sound with no meaning - which they silently repeat in their heads.\n\nThis allegedly helps to draw awareness away from the usual compulsive and repetitive thought patterns that occupy us - such as never-ending to-do lists at work.\n\nAt 7.30am, she makes her children's breakfast, packs her daughter Violet's school lunch and gets her home ready to begin whatever she has in store that day\n\nAt 7am, it's time for Rachael's one and only coffee of the day - which comes in the form of 'collagen coffee'.\n\nTo make this, Rachael fuses black coffee, almond milk, Kissed Earth collagen, mushrooms and maca powder all blended together.\n\nAt 7.30am, she makes her children's breakfast, packs her daughter Violet's school lunch and gets her home ready to begin whatever she has in store that day.\n\nRachael's evening routine is no less detailed, and the model said she always tries to have dinner between 5 and 6pm - and 'no later than 6 if possible'\n\nWhat is Rachel's evening routine? * 5-6pm: Dinner, always no later than 6pm. * 6.30pm: Play time with the children. * 7pm: Bath time for the children in calming essential oils like lavender and Vetiver. * 7.30pm: Kids go to bed and Rachael spends time with her partner. * 8pm: Warm shower and bed for reading. * 8.30-9pm: Lights out and sleep.\n\nRachael's evening routine is no less detailed, and the model said she always tries to have dinner between 5 and 6pm - and 'no later than 6 if possible'.\n\nAt 6.30pm, she'll enjoy some 'play time' with her young family, before she bathes the kids at 7pm in calming essential oils like lavender or Vetiver.\n\n'I try to make this a wind down period,' she said.\n\n'No technology, dim lights etc.'\n\nAt 7.30pm, she puts the kids to bed and spends some time with her partner, before having her own warm shower at 8pm and going to bed for reading.\n\n'If I do happen to have my phone in use at this time I'll wear my Baxter Blue light-blocking glasses to help omit the blue violet light,' she said.\n\nBetween 8.30pm and 9pm, Rachael said she turns out the light and goes to sleep.\n\nBetween 8.30pm and 9pm, Rachael said she turns out the light and goes to sleep (Rachael pictured)\n\nBeneath Rachael's post, others shared the morning and evening habits that allow them to feel their best.\n\n'I love listening to the birds chirp outside at sunrise. In the evening I try to do some deep breathing and listen to some music that really moves me,' one woman posted.\n\nAnother said: 'Ten big breaths as soon as I wake - then three stretches of choice followed by lemon water too'.", "description": "Model and mother Rachael Finch has offered a look inside her exhausting morning and evening wellness routine - and for those seeking to emulate, it's not for the faint of heart.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20304628-0-image-a-21_1572306623170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
