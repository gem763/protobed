Security forces have stepped up their presence in major cities and have been conducting spot checks of mobile phones for political content.\n\nSisi, in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, indirectly accused the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood of stirring up the protests, saying \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d was to blame.\n\nAnalysts say it won\u2019t be easy to curb dissent without addressing its economic and political causes. Many Egyptians distrust government promises after three years of austerity agreed with the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $12 billion loan.\n\nSince then, Egypt has introduced valued-added tax, devalued the currency and raised the prices of electricity and fuel.\n\nTURMOIL\n\nSisi remains popular among many ordinary people for stabilizing Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 led to turmoil that scared away tourists and foreign investors, and brought the public finances close to collapse.\n\nBut the austerity measures, which were accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, heaped pressure on many. The number of Egyptians living below the poverty line rose to 32.5% in the 2017/18 financial year from 27.8% two years earlier.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is a very serious warning, the situation is not totally under control,\u201d said Mohamed Zaree of the non-governmental Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies.\n\nHe said most people who took to the streets were not members of organised political parties \u201cwhich shows that there is public anger\u201d.\n\nThe protesters lack leaders, political affiliations and coordination, analysts said. The crowds were spontaneous, making the protests difficult to control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear whether protests will escalate or fizzle right now,\u201d said Michele Dunne, director of the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cBut if not this week, protests are likely to return in the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\nSeveral Cairo residents said hardship was driving the protests, and they might join in if they could be sure of safety in numbers.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the size of the protest. If many people join, I might too,\u201d said a driver who gave his name only as Abdallah.\n\n\u201cIf numbers are too small it is too unsafe,\u201d he said before adding: \u201cPeople are fed up.\u201d\n\nA 40-year-old engineer who used to support Sisi until austerity started to bite said: \u201cI will take part in Friday\u2019s protests. I\u2019m unhappy with where the country is going.\u201d\n\nVIDEOS\n\nThe protests came after videos posted from Spain by Mohamed Ali, a hitherto little-known actor and building contractor, were widely shared online. He accused Sisi and parts of the military of corruption and squandering funds on projects such as new presidential palaces.\n\nSisi denied the claims. State media have tried to discredit Ali\u2019s motives, and have broadcast pro-Sisi songs and reports on his achievements, while also warning against destabilisation.\n\nThis has not stopped other dissidents uploading videos discussing the security crackdown, corruption and poverty.\n\nAhdaf Soueif, an Egyptian novelist, said Ali\u2019s videos had struck a chord because he casts himself as a self-made man with a modest background.\n\n\u201cHe is what the millions of young Egyptian men with brains and ambition and a sense that the dice are loaded against them would wish to be,\u201d she said. \u201cThe system has no idea how to deal with him.\u201d\n\nThe fact that protesters managed to gather at all has prompted some to suggest that officials were unsure on how to respond.\n\n\u201cThis is a much more serious issue for President Sisi than foreign investors because the protests suggest there\u2019s a division behind the scenes in the Egyptian deep state as much as unrest in the society,\u201d said Hasnain Malik, managing director, frontier markets equity strategy at investment firm Tellimer in Dubai.\n\nTo address grievances, authorities could increase cash handouts, pensions and insurance for the poor and create low-income housing, with which the IMF would agree, said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Egypt\u2019s Naeem Brokerage, adding that he does not expect protests to escalate.\n\nWhile the reforms and the 2016 devaluation have stabilized the currency, Egypt has not been able to create jobs by boosting non-oil foreign direct investment, which fell in the first three months of 2019 to its lowest for at least five years.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Capital Economics said authorities should improve the business environment, make the labour market more flexible and make more land available, but questioned whether this would happen.", "description": "Scattered protests in Egypt in the past few days highlight the risk that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi could face broader dissent, driven by grievances over economic austerity and allegations of official corruption.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433788692&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1DK", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
