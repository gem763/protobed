He was located in Morocco, where he was arrested in 2017 following his indictment on the sex charges, and was extradited to New Mexico.", "description": "Catholic priest Arthur Perrault convicted of \u2018long-term\u2019 abuse of altar boy in New Mexico in 1990s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2caf60439360f5b0b25b4aa4113890ca6d6d0ed1/0_68_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f8713b0d1b8c48b2c2861d8fa593201", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
