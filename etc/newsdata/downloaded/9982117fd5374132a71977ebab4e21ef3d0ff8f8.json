Call it the thousand-year bull market \u2026 one that I can see continuing for another 1,000 years.\n\n5G Stocks More\n\nFortunately, we don\u2019t need to think that far ahead to make money now. In fact, we can start right now. The next great leap in technology and communications is happening as we speak, and this move to 5G is going to be the biggest one yet.\n\nThink about how important technology has become to our economy, our lives, and our world over the last century. Take technology away and almost everything collapses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf that\u2019s not the definition of infrastructure, I don\u2019t know what is. It used to be roads, and now it\u2019s the information super highway. Technology is everywhere \u2026 from our computers to our clothes dryers to our cars.\n\nInvestors who recognized this trend in the 1980s and 1990s and owned the best internet infrastructure stocks made a ton of money:\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the leader in semiconductors. Those chips were a big part of the foundation, and the stock soared more than 3,500% in the 1990s.\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) made the equipment that made all of those chips. Its return in the 1990s: more than 6,150%.\n\nThen there was Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the king of communications and networking equipment. This stock went from under $1 per share in the early 1990s to $43 by the end of the decade for life-changing returns of nearly 34,000%! (The stock took off so sharply in the late 1990s that you can see how the higher prices on the y-axis are mushed together.)\n\nCSCO Performance Chart More\n\nWe are now on the verge of the most advanced breakthrough of all \u2014 a new infrastructure that will not only make communications faster but enable virtually all of the coming technological innovations across the world.\n\nJust as there were fortunes made in prior generations, there will be big money made once again. In fact, I think this opportunity is even bigger because the leap ahead will drive other tech trends \u2014 some of the most powerful the world has ever seen.\n\nThink of it as the next-generation toll road. The road to the future passes through 5G wireless technology, and it\u2019s time to set up our booth and start collecting.\n\n\u201cA Game Changer for Humanity\u201d\n\n\u201cGet ready,\u201d 5G \u201cis going to change EVERYTHING,\u201d says Forbes.\n\nZDNet says it\u2019s so critical that it\u2019s going to \u201creplace the future.\u201d\n\nFinancial Times calls it simply \u201ca game changer for humanity.\u201d\n\n5G is poised to fundamentally alter the very fabric of society. This tech is little-known (as of now), but it is going to be the centerpiece of an entire new generation of groundbreaking technologies.
