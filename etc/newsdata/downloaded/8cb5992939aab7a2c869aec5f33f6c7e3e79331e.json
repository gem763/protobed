Phil Scott (R) speaks at a news conference in Essex Junction, Vt., on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019. He said he supported an impeachment inquiry into the actions of President Trump. (Wilson Ring)\n\nFor the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan.\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday that they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Scott called the inquiry \u201cappropriate\u201d and said it is a key part of Congress\u2019s duty as a co-equal branch of government.\n\n\u201cI think we have much more to learn and need to understand all the facts as this serious allegation is considered,\u201c he said. \"Congress has a solemn responsibility to every American to fulfill its role in our government system of checks and balances.\u201d\n\nBut impeachment, he cautioned, \u201cis a very serious issue and should not be taken lightly or abused.\u201d\n\n[Cracks emerge among Senate Republicans over Trump urging Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden]\n\nAt a Thursday event, Baker told reporters that, \"It\u2019s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nAs governors, however, Scott and Baker have no role in the formal process, so their break from the Republican ranks is largely symbolic.\n\nSo far, just two Senate Republicans have publicly expressed serious concern over revelations that Trump repeatedly urged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, one of his foremost political rivals.\n\n\"There\u2019s obviously a lot that\u2019s very troubling there,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) on Wednesday, adding that Democrats should still be careful when using the word \u201cimpeach.\u201d\n\nSasse opposed Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy, but has since won the president\u2019s favor \u2014 and a Trump endorsement of his reelection bid.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also said Wednesday that, \"It remains troubling in the extreme. It\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201d That same day, The Post reported that further cracks were emerging privately among GOP senators.\n\nOther Republican governors, even those who haven\u2019t been afraid to criticize the president in the past, have remained neutral or silent when questioned about the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine refused to comment, saying only that he thinks \"it\u2019s important we wait until all the evidence is in.\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n[Why now? The moments that moved Pelosi and House Democrats toward impeachment.]\n\nAt least a modicum of Republican support is seen by some strategists as crucial if Democrats are to wage a politically successful impeachment battle. That was also the position of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 before the explosive new allegations against Trump surfaced.\n\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path because it divides the country,\u201d Pelosi told The Post in March. \"And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Vermont, Scott has spent the last two decades in Republican state politics, serving in the Vermont Senate and as lieutenant governor before he ran for and won the chief executive job in 2016. That same year, Hillary Clinton won nearly 56 percent of the vote in the presidential election in the state, while Trump won just under 30 percent.\n\nIn June, after Trump told four female Congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, Scott was one of the few prominent Republicans to label the president\u2019s words racist.\n\n\u201cI find these statements offensive, racist and certainly not what we expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world,\u201d Scott said then. \u201cWords matter and we\u2019ve seen the same rhetoric used throughout history to discriminate, degrade and divide.\u201d\n\nBaker, too, governs a state that backed Clinton over Trump in 2016, 60 to 33 percent. After an on-again-off-again career in state politics, Baker ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2014. He won the endorsement of the Boston Globe \u2014 the first Republican in two decades to do so \u2014 and then won the election.\n\nSince taking office, Baker routinely ranks among the country\u2019s most popular governors. This feat, as a Republican running a state with a famed liberal state, has often been attributed to two skills: his negotiation of a bipartisan government and his ability to distance himself and his own brand of politics from Trump.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhere House Democrats stand on impeaching Trump\n\nWhistleblower claimed Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up\n\nAnalysis | With Trump under threat, his allies are seizing on various defenses.
