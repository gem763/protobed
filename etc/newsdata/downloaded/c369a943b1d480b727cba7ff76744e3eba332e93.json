So it is allowing us to gain new insights that really haven't been able to do before.\"\n\nTo capture the whale\u2019s perspective footage, the researchers used suction cup tags fitted with cameras and sensors.\n\n(Image: University of Hawaii)\n\nThis footage was paired with drone data to create a one-of-a-kind video of the bubble-net feeding in action.\n\nMr Bejder added: \u201cSo basically we have two angles and the drone's perspective is showing us these bubble nets if you will and how the bubbles are starting to come to the surface and how the animals come up through the bubble net as they surface, while the cameras on the whales are telling us from the animal's perspective, so overlaying these two data sets is quite exciting.\"\n\nThe researchers hope the video will help scientists to understand how humpback whales feed, how often they need to feed, what they feed on and how fast their bodies change or grow.", "description": "Researchers from the University of Hawaii have captured beautiful footage of humpback whales bubble-net feeding in the waters off of Southeast Alaska", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "University Of Hawaii"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20576694.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-120857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
