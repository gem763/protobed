ESR can also exercise a 15% \u201cgreenshoe\u201d, or over-allotment, option if there is demand.\n\nESR had planned to raise up to $1.24 billion in its earlier IPO attempt in June, but postponed the deal citing \u201ccurrent market conditions\u201d.\n\nSources, however, told Reuters that ESR had targeted a relatively aggressive valuation of between $6.28 billion and $6.75 billion, making the deal a hard sell at the time.\n\nESR declined to comment.\n\nAt least seven existing shareholders are selling shares in the IPO, including Warburg Pincus unit WP OCIM, Goldman Sachs Investments Holdings (Asia) Ltd and e-commerce firm JD.com Inc\u2019s (JD.O) Jingdong Logistics Group Corp, the term sheet showed.\n\nESR has lined up $585 million from one cornerstone investor, OMERS Administration Corporation, among Canada\u2019s largest pension funds, based on the mid-point of the price range. It had not secured any cornerstone investors in its June IPO attempt.\n\nCLSA and Deutsche Bank are joint sponsors for the IPO.\n\nESR was formed in 2016 by the merger of the Japan-centric Redwood Group and China-focused e-Shang, co-founded by Warburg Pincus in 2011.\n\nIts shares will be priced on Oct. 25 and trading is scheduled to start on Nov. 1.\n\nIPO ACTIVITY PICKS UP\n\nESR\u2019s float will be among a clutch of recent listings seen as tests of investor sentiment in Hong Kong that has been roiled by a five-month long political crisis.\n\nHaving topped the global charts in 2018 for funds raised through IPOs, Hong Kong is currently lagging behind both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq with $18.5 billion raised as of mid-October, Refinitiv data showed. That compared with $21.9 billion on the NYSE and $23.3 billion on Nasdaq.\n\nBut IPO activity in the city has picked up, marked by the September relaunch by AB InBev\u2019s Asia-Pacific unit.\n\nBudweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd (1876.HK) raised about $5 billion in Hong Kong\u2019s biggest and the world\u2019s second-largest IPO so far this year.\n\nIt had cancelled a plan for a bigger float in July citing \u201cseveral factors, including the prevailing market conditions\u201d.\n\nAmong other planned listings, JS Global Lifestyle Company Ltd, on Monday launched a Hong Kong IPO of up to $464 million, according to a marketing term sheet seen by Reuters.\n\nBacked by Chinese private-equity firm CDH Investments, JS Global is selling about 500 million shares with an indicative price band of HK$5.55 to HK$7.25 per share.\n\nJS Global did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company owns Chinese kitchen appliances maker Joyoung and U.S. home appliances maker SharkNijia.", "description": "ESR Cayman Ltd <1821.HK>, backed by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus, relaunched a bigger Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) that aims to raise as much as $1.45 billion, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
