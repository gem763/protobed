Federal court documents show that she was sentenced on Tuesday to 2-1/4 years time served.\n\nXiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen and Princeton University graduate student, was conducting dissertation research in Iran in 2016 when he was detained and accused by Iran of \u201cspying under the cover of research,\u201d a claim his family and university deny.\n\nHe was subsequently convicted on espionage charges, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nU.S. officials typically do not discuss such cases in public. Brian Hook, the U.S. State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran, on Monday said that if Iran wanted to show good faith, it should release the U.S. citizens it has detained, including the Princeton graduate student.\n\n\u201cWe spent time this week, we spend time nearly every day working to release the Americans and others who are detained wrongfully inside of Iran. We will continue to do that,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nWashington has demanded Iran release Americans it is holding including Wang, Iranian-American father and son Siamak and Baquer Namazi; Michael White, a Navy veteran imprisoned in 2018; and Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent missing since 2007.\n\nRouhani said Tehran is open to talks about prisoner exchanges, saying at his news conference, \u201cWe have always shown goodwill in the issue of prisoner swaps.\u201d\n\nRouhani pointed to the release in June of a Lebanese citizen with U.S. residency who was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of spying for the United States.\n\n\u201cAfter his release, Americans thanked us but failed to reciprocate. Therefore, the ball is in the American\u2019s court now,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nIn June, Iran released Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese businessman with U.S. permanent residency who had been in prison for four years, in a gesture meant as an opening for U.S.-Iranian talks, according to three Western sources familiar with the issue.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined on Thursday to discuss the possibility of a U.S.-Iranian prisoner swap after the United States deported an Iranian woman who pleaded guilty to exporting restricted U.S. technology to Iran.", "authors": ["Humeyra Pamuk", "Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
