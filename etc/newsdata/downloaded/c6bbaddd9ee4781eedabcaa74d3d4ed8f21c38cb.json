But that\u2019s what we knew would happen if we won test matches.\n\n\u201cIt gives the players - I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s one word for it - but it makes us incredibly proud. We are playing for 125 million people and most of them don\u2019t normally support rugby. But they are behind us.\u201d\n\nMuch of that new-found favour came following the surprise 19-12 victory over high-ranking Ireland in their second Pool A game, which has presented Japan with the chance to not only qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time, but also secure top spot in the group and avoid New Zealand in the next stage.\n\nBut Joseph has also cautioned that the Ireland victory has perhaps raised expectations a little too high.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to put everybody straight. We\u2019ve got a really awesome opportunity to do something that\u2019s not been done before. No-one thought we could beat Ireland and now they think we can win every game we play. That\u2019s how silly it is.\u201d\n\nHe said they are not looking at anything beyond the crucial Scotland fixture having also claimed three wins at the 2015 World Cup in England, which were not enough to secure a place in the knockout stages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s game-by-game. Enjoy this week again and then get back for what\u2019s going to be a really tough game against Scotland.\u201d", "description": "Japan coach Jamie Joseph is not sure if his team is more globally popular than New Zealand, but can feel a massive swell of public support as they stand on the brink of an historic Rugby World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437565001&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9501M", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
