In what capacity I'm not sure but I want to make sure that the influence I have in the country has a positive contribution,\" he said.\n\n- Religious, ethnic conflict -\n\nAfter two days of violent protests, tensions had cooled Friday in Addis Ababa, although the total damage inflicted by the unrest was still being tallied.\n\nFisseha of AI said the violence had included instances of security forces opening fire on protesters but was increasingly taking the form of ethnic and religious clashes.\n\n\"Some people have lost their lives with sticks, with machetes, some houses have been burned. People have been using even bullets and light arms to kill each other, to fight each other,\" he said.\n\nAt least six people were killed in the town of Ambo, west of Addis, after security forces opened fire on protesters, Fisseha said.\n\nEthnic and religious violence has been reported in the towns and cities of Dodola, Harar, Balerobe and Adama.\n\nProperty belonging to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which some associate with the Amhara ethnic group, has been targeted in several locations, Fisseha said.\n\nDaniel Bekele, head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, urged public figures to tamp down virulent rhetoric that could contribute to additional unrest.\n\n\"It is extremely depressing that public officials and community leaders don't appreciate the consequences of their actions and words leading to this senseless loss of lives, destruction of property and disruption of ordinary life,\" he said.\n\n\"As security forces are struggling to calm the crisis, everyone has a responsibility to do their share and cooperate.\"", "description": "Violence in Ethiopia that began with protests against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and quickly morphed into ethnic clashes has left 67 people dead in Oromia state, a police official said Friday.
