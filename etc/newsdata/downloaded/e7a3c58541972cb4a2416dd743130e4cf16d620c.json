The money will pay for bilingual technical assistance and protect or create 300 jobs, according to the release.\n\nAD\n\nThe light-rail line is being built with a $5.6 billion public-private partnership \u2014 one of the broadest of its kind for any U.S. transit project.\n\nUnder the most recent timetable, the rail line, which will have 21 stations, would begin carrying passengers in late 2022, starting in Prince George\u2019s.\n\nMany small firms in the project corridor, including in predominantly Latino communities such as Langley Park, are concerned about the loss of business owing to disruption during Purple Line construction.\n\nAD\n\nCommunity leaders welcomed the JPMorgan Chase investment, saying local governments did not have sufficient resources to do what was needed to ensure low- and middle-income communities benefit from the transit project.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s some real money from a real bank foundation, to do some of the things that got cut out of the budget when the whole Purple Line was launched,\u201d said Gerrit Knaap, director of the National Center for Smart Growth at the University of Maryland at College Park.\n\nAD\n\nHe referred to a gap left when the administration of Gov. Larry Hogan (R) scaled back the project to cut costs as a condition of building it. The National Center for Smart Growth administers the Purple Line Corridor Coalition, a public-private coalition that promotes economic and community development.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFive million dollars isn\u2019t a trivial amount of money to invest in the corridor, particularly for affordable housing and small-business preservation,\u201d Knaap said. \u201cThe counties don\u2019t have a lot of money.\u201d\n\nThe funds will allow three community organizations \u2014 Enterprise Community Partners, the National Housing Trust and the Latino Economic Development Center \u2014 to offer loans and other resources for housing and small-business projects.\n\nPreviously, the biggest grant for such projects in the Purple Line corridor was a $2 million award from the Federal Transit Administration. Kaiser Permanente has also contributed money to the effort.\n\nAD\n\nThe award is part of a $1.75 billion, five-year global philanthropic commitment to promote inclusive growth by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s department of corporate social responsibility.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is inequality is continuing to be a huge issue in the communities where we\u2019re working,\u201d said Colleen Briggs, the bank\u2019s head of community innovation. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for business. . . . Despite a growing economy, people are working harder and not getting ahead.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cGovernments and charities alone can\u2019t tackle these issues. Companies like JPMorgan have a responsibility to be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nThe bank\u2019s effort includes a $25 million, five-year commitment in the greater Washington region. In 2017, it awarded a $5 million grant for the 11th Street Bridge project in the District.\n\nThe news release included comments supporting the grant from Hogan, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) and Prince George\u2019s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHogan said the JPMorgan Chase investment represented \u201cexactly the kind of forward-thinking project that other leaders across the country should be thinking about \u2014 a partnership between the federal, state and local governments and the private sector.\u201d\n\nElrich said the effort would help build \u201ca more equitable and inclusive region.\u201d Alsobrooks said, \u201cWe have a responsibility to ensure that those who work here are able to live here, while also ensuring that our seniors are able to age in place.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The bank\u2019s grant, the largest so far in the corridor; will support affordable housing and small businesses.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yQVe3Q6gz1hSM7ZbLnHKck7e_GA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LRUNJTDBK4I6TH7SVPEYJXE65Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
