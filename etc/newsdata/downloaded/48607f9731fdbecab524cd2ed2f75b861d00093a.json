REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe trade war has hardened into a political and ideological battle that runs far deeper than tariffs, trade experts, executives, and officials in both countries say.\n\nChina\u2019s Communist Party is unlikely to budge on U.S. demands to fundamentally change the way it runs the economy, while the U.S. won\u2019t backtrack on labeling Chinese companies national security threats.\n\nThe conflict between the two countries could take a decade to resolve, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow warned on Sept. 6. Yu Yongding, an influential former policy adviser to China\u2019s central bank, told Reuters that China was in no rush to make a deal.\n\nPresidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping may hammer out an interim agreement in October to soothe stock markets and claim political victory after this week\u2019s lower-level talks.\n\nBut any final agreement is \u201cextremely unlikely to meaningfully address the Chinese structural reforms\u201d sought by the U.S. and other countries, said Kellie Meiman Hock, a former U.S. Trade Representative official and managing partner with McLarty Associates, a policy and government consultancy.\n\nNegotiators have made little discernable progress on the many points of disagreement since negotiations broke down in May, sources briefed on the talks say.\n\nISSUES DIVIDE\n\nBeijing is unwilling to address the way it supports state-owned companies and subsidizes their products in coming talks, sources in China and the U.S. say. The U.S. continues to label Chinese tech company Huawei a national security threat, and dangle the threat of new tariffs against China.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate result of talks must be the dropping of all tariffs,\u201d said He Weiwen, senior fellow, Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University. \u201cThis is the baseline for China.\u201d He is not optimistic about the talks\u2019 prospects.\n\nSince trade negotiations between the world\u2019s largest economies collapsed in May, both countries have also broken promises and traded public insults. The mood is upbeat, but a single Trump tweet could turn that around, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re locked in this uncomfortable embrace,\u201d said William Reinsch, a former senior Commerce Department official and Center for Strategic and International Studies fellow.\n\n\u201cBoth presidents have undercut their negotiators and neither side can rely on what the other has said,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018TECTONIC SHIFT\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201ctough on China\u201d stance has swept in a new way of thinking about Beijing in Washington, despite the unpopularity of many of his other policies. The U.S. Congress, bitterly divided along partisan lines on most issues, is united about the need for systemic reform in China.\n\nDemocrats running against Trump aren\u2019t likely to repair the China relationship if they take the White House in 2020. In a debate on Sept. 12, presidential candidates used terms like corruption and theft to discuss China\u2019s trade practices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a tectonic shift,\u201d said Warren Maruyama, former general counsel for the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office and a partner with law firm Hogan Lovells.\n\n\u201cThe old idea that China was in the middle of free market economic reforms that would lead them our way is effectively dead,\u201d Maruyama said. \u201cThere\u2019s bipartisan support for a tougher China policy.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are responding, with several China-related bills making their way through Congress, from legislation to punish Beijing for human rights abuses against Muslims in Xinjiang and to support protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nAdditionally, the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, could include provisions targeting China on issues ranging from technology transfers to the sale of synthetic opioids.\n\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE\n\nTrump faces a worsening economy and recession fears at home, thanks in part to the tariffs he has enacted, but key constituencies have stood by him so far. U.S. executives in China say Beijing is miscalculating if it thinks the trade war will undermine Trump\u2019s political support.\n\n\u201cIf anything, the trade war has unified support in the business community,\u201d one senior American executive in China said.\n\n\u201cThe problems are deep, and they are structural,\u201d said Craig Allen, a former senior U.S. Commerce Department official who now heads the US-China Business Council. The countries\u2019 high-tech sectors may be permanently decoupled, he said, thanks to concerns about Chinese espionage, cyber hacking and intellectual property theft.\n\nChina\u2019s Communist Party also faces a slowing economy as it prepares to celebrate on Oct. 1 70 years of ruling the country.\n\nMany in Beijing believe that Trump\u2019s erratic approach to the trade war this year has provided Xi with convenient short-term political cover, allowing him to blame White House tariff increases instead of domestic policies for the slowdown.\n\nIn a throwback to the Mao Zedong era, Xi told cadres this month that there must be a \u201cresolute struggle\u201d against any risks and challenges to the party\u2019s leadership, the country\u2019s sovereignty and security and anything that threatens the country\u2019s core interests.\n\nInvestments between China and the U.S. dropped to the lowest six-month level in five years in the first half of this year, a study by the research firm Rhodium Group shows.\n\nForeign direct investment and venture-capital deals between the two countries fell to $13 billion in the period, down 49% from the first half of 2018.", "description": "U.S. and Chinese officials will restart trade talks at the end of this week, but any agreement the world's largest economies carve out is expected to be a superficial fix.", "authors": ["Michael Martina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430710719&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G09V", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
