He has teed up a massive 'Super Saturday' showdown with MPs as his hopes of a Brexit deal look to be crumbling amid DUP opposition\n\nAnd he later even compared his intense negotiations to that of a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption - in which the hero escapes a jail by wading through a tunnel of waste.\n\nDowning Street confirmed the government will now table a motion for the Commons to sit on Saturday - the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands War.\n\nIf there is a deal at the summit today MPs will be asked to approve it on Saturday, but if not Mr Johnson is expected to stage a vote on whether to delay Brexit or go for No Deal.\n\nRemainers are also preparing a bid to force a second referendum, as the struggle for the country's future intensifies.\n\nAmid desperate efforts to win over the DUP - whose 10 MPs are seen as critical to unlocking a Parliamentary majority for a deal - there are hotly denied claims that billions of pounds more funding for Northern Ireland is on the table as a sweetener.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, leaves Downing Street amid desperate talks to get a Brexit deal finalised ahead of an EU summit in Brussels today\n\nERG members (second from left to right) Mark Francois, Steve Baker, Iain Duncan Smith and Bill Cash leave Downing Street following last minute talks to try and secure a Brexit deal\n\nLeader Arlene Foster was in No10 for more talks yesterday afternoon, but she dismissed afterwards EU claims reported by Irish broadcaster RTE that she had given in on key issues.\n\nShe tweeted: 'Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.'\n\nOne Cabinet minister told MailOnline there was 'guarded optimism' over the chances of getting the DUP on board but they insisted the government is preparing to fight to get Brexit done by October 31 if a resolution cannot be found.\n\n'We will be ready if the DUP can't be won over,' they said.\n\nIt comes as chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, Steve Baker, said that 'great progress' has been made in talks with Number 10 last night.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcome European Commission president-elect Ursula Von der Leyen after a joint Franco-German cabinet meeting in Toulouse, France yesterday. Macron had been optimistic yesterday evening as he said he wanted 'to believe that a deal is being finalised'\n\nHe said: 'We know there will be compromises, but we will be looking at this deal in minute detail, with a view to supporting it.\n\n'But until we get that text, we can't say.'\n\nHe added however, that the ERG 'can't support deal without seeing text'.\n\n'We really must see the text in time to read it in order to vote on Saturday,' he said.\n\n'Time is becoming very short for everyone now. As Michel Barnier famously said, 'the clock is ticking'.\n\n'We need to get through this (European) Council, have the text of the deal, have the implementing legislation ready, and we need to be voting on that on Saturday.'", "description": "The DUP's Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds have said they 'could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues' and that there is a 'lack of clarity on VAT' in the new Brexit deal.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19822622-0-image-a-8_1571291978995.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
