Motorway limits could rise to 80mph, Grant Shapps has suggested\n\nThe previous proposed rise to the limit he was referring to had been put forward by then transport secretary Philip Hammond in September 2011.\n\nThe plans were abandoned after the independent committee on climate change warned that the increase from 70mph to 80mph could generate an extra 2.2 million tons of CO2 annually, undermining emissions targets.\n\nWhile an increase in electric vehicles will negate the pollution impact, consistently travelling at speeds of 80mph will undoubtedly limit their battery capacity and put an additional strain on the already limited charging infrastructure.\n\nWith an electric car's battery power drained more rapidly when travelling at greater speeds, owners will ultimately be forced to recharge more often on the motorway network.\n\nThe government has recently committed to invest \u00a3400 million into the country's charging infrastructure, including doubling the number of rapid chargers to 5,000 on major routes and motorways over the next five years.\n\nAt an earlier conference talk he hinted moves to ensure no new cars are petrol or diesel by 2040 could be brought forward by five years.\n\nShapps is considering the move because of the growth in the use of electric cars, like this Tesla Model 3 (which he owns)\n\nThe comments were made just weeks after Mr Shapps hinted the plug-in car grant - a government subsidy of \u00a33,500 towards buying a new pure-electric vehicle - could soon be terminated as demand for plug-in models grows.\n\nThis was shortly after the transport secretary himself had used the grant to purchase a \u00a340,000 Tesla Model 3.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1967, the only speed limits on British roads were a restriction of 30mph in built up areas.\n\nOutside towns and villages, cars were only limited by the power of their engines and the ability of the driver.", "description": "Transport secretary Grant Shapps is considering increasing the 70mph speed limit on the British motorway network which was first introduced as a temporary measure in 1965.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter", "Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/03/19235504-0-image-a-18_1570070276945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
