Police were seen arresting at least one group of protesters.\n\nOn the first day of the new school year, secondary and university students began a school boycott. Some had believed the start of the academic year would mark the end of almost three months of mass demonstrations against the Hong Kong government, backed by Beijing.\n\nInstead, organisers estimated at least 9,000 students from more than 200 schools would be participating in the class boycott, which was expected to last until Tuesday and continue one day a week until the protesters\u2019 demands are met.\n\nQuick guide What are the Hong Kong protests about? Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nSecondary students were seen kneeling, holding hands, and chanting in the rain outside their schools. In Kowloon, dozens of students and alumni stood outside a Christian secondary school, Ying Wa College, at 7am chanting: \u201cFree Hong Kong! Democracy Now!\u201d. The students, dressed in their school uniforms and hardhats, masks and goggles, planned to boycott the term\u2019s opening ceremony.\n\nSome had painted one side of their goggles red, in reference to a woman who was blinded in one eye at the protests. One held a yellow sign with the Bible verse: \u201cBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d The students started off kneeling but soon stood as they were hit by heavy rains as a category three typhoon approached the city.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to give up our dignity just to beg the society to change,\u201d said Thomas Loh, one of the students who helped organise the class boycott at his school.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students protest at Edinburgh Place in Hong Kong on Monday.

On Sunday, demonstrators attempted to lay siege to the airport, prompting a swift response from riot police. On Saturday, riot police stormed a metro station, attacking trapped protesters with batons.\n\nFire and fear: Hong Kong lit by protests after dark \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nMonday\u2019s class boycott was accompanied by a call for a general strike. It followed two days of mass protests where demonstrators paralysed links to airport, and clashed with police outside government buildings and in MTR stations.\n\nSeveral editorials in Chinese state media on Monday condemned the protesters as \u201ccrazy and vicious\u201d for bringing \u201ccatastrophe\u201d upon the Hong Kong economy. An editorial on the website of the state-run news agency Xinhua warned \u201cthe end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nThe shift of the protests to school campuses is comes after Chinese officials have blamed the protests on the city\u2019s liberal education curriculum. In recent weeks, Beijing has criticised teachers and parents for not instilling patriotic values in students and called for an overhaul of Hong Kong\u2019s education system, which includes topics like the Chinese military\u2019s violent crack down on democracy demonstrators on 4 June, 1989.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police wait at a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station as commuters walk past in Hong Kong Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters\n\nAt Ying Wa college, secondary students were preparing to hold \u201ccivic lessons,\u201d forums and salons, to educate their younger peers who have not followed the protests as closely. At the school gates, teachers watched as students handed out permission slips for parents to sign allowing the students to skip class.\n\nStudents said they would soon escalate their actions if the government continued to refuse protesters\u2019 demands, which include the formal withdrawal of the bill and making democratic reforms.\n\nHong Kong protests: calls grow to give citizens right to live and work in UK Read more\n\n\u201cFor now, we are still boycotting under the school but escalation means not only do we boycott \u2026 we have to paralyse the teaching institutions,\u201d said Kinson Cheung, 18, an alumni of the school who had to support the boycott.\n\nLoh said: \u201cI was once a so-called \u201cHong Kong pig\u201d , someone who only wants to live peacefully and cares more about the economy than politics, but now I realise how important this home and the freedom I enjoy here is to me.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI really hope Hong Kong can once again be a free city.\u201d", "description": "School and university students call for democracy after weekend that saw some of the most violent clashes so far", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcead42de64b79c92ac7c47ab6d53c5caeb1a8aa/0_135_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8e7017a1826312bfa7590f03543126e"}
