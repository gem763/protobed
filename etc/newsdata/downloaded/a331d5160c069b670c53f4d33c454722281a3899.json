Bercow has bent every rule in the book to help Remainers scupper the result of the 2016 referendum.\n\nTo nobody's great surprise, up popped that gurning gargoyle Bercow (pictured) yesterday to stymie, yet again, the latest attempt to get Brexit through the Commons\n\nHe's like The Man From Del Monte in reverse. Readers who recall this famous TV advertising campaign from the Eighties and Nineties will know exactly what I'm getting at.\n\nIt featured a colonial fruit and vegetable buyer for a canned goods company. Kitted out in a fedora and Our Man In Havana white suit, he would be wafted to remote tropical farming districts in pursuit of the purest produce.\n\nNervous locals who'd spent months toiling in the fields would await the arrival of his seaplane, or chauffeur-driven limo.\n\nAfter ceremoniously squeezing oranges, dissecting pineapples and sampling freshly picked tomatoes, The Man From Del Monte would pass judgment.\n\nA thumbs down meant financial ruin, a thumbs up prosperity. Eventually, a farmer with a Viva Zapata moustache and a dodgy, Mind Your Language accent would declare, to rapturous relief:\n\n'The Man From Del Monte, he say YES!'\n\nHe was never going to permit Boris's deal to be put to a vote of MPs \u2014 especially once it became apparent that the Government might just have cobbled together enough support to get it passed\n\nIf they ever revive the campaign, Bercow would be perfect for the part.\n\nThe problem would be getting him to stick to the script. Because when it comes to Brexit, The Man From Del Monte, he always say NO! It doesn't matter what ministers lay before the House, the Speaker takes a perverse delight in obstructing all attempts to take Britain out of the EU.\n\nHe was never going to permit Boris's deal to be put to a vote of MPs \u2014 especially once it became apparent that the Government might just have cobbled together enough support to get it passed.\n\nScaling new heights of pomposity and self-justification, Bercow blew the Government's Brexit timetable out of the water.\n\nIt's largely irrelevant which reason he plucked out of thin air. If it hadn't have been this one, it would have been another.\n\nBut bear with me for a moment. Bercow said that he wouldn't allow a vote because Parliament had already voted on a similar motion and some arcane rule prevents the same question being put twice.\n\nIn which case, can we also expect him to stop MPs putting forward amendments calling for a second referendum and continued membership of the customs union \u2014 both of which have already been rejected?\n\nDon't hold your breath.\n\nWhat really sticks in the craw is the repeated bleating of Bercow and his fellow diehard Remainers that democratic accountability demands Brexit is subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nDon't make me laugh.\n\nThis rotten, cynical Parliament has shown nothing but contempt for democracy. Having promised to respect the referendum result, the majority of MPs have strained every sinew to overturn it.\n\nThe only reason they are insisting on Parliamentary scrutiny is because that's the best way of preventing Brexit ever happening.\n\nI don't want to depress you, but we could be in for another three years of this. Because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there needn't be another General Election until the summer of 2022.\n\nLabour isn't going to back an election it would inevitably lose. The only way an election could be triggered is if the Government is defeated in a vote of confidence.\n\nBut the Opposition refuses to move one.\n\nI suppose Boris could always hold a vote of confidence in himself in the hope that he'd lose, thus freeing him to go to the country. But he doesn't even have the numbers to get that through the House.\n\nDespite agitating for a 'People's Vote', a 'confirmatory vote', the Opposition is scared stiff of letting the people decide.\n\nAmong those demanding a People's Vote are a couple of dozen MPs who have resigned from the Tory and Labour parties recently and either joined the Lib Dems, set up Change UK, or are sitting as independents.\n\nChucky Umunna is on his third party in the past few months.\n\nNot a single one of them has had the decency to offer themselves back to their constituents in a 'confirmatory' by-election, even though they now represent a different political party.\n\nSo I think we can take whatever they say about a People's Vote with a shovel of Himalayan rock salt.\n\nTo be honest, I had hoped that after I'd taken a week's holiday, I would come back to find MPs had seen sense and embraced Boris's deal on Saturday.\n\nNot that I think it is worth the paper it's written on. It's Theresa May's dismal, defeatist 'deal' on Botox \u2014 a pig in lipstick. The triumphalism we are seeing is some quarters is misplaced wishful thinking.\n\nBut it's probably the best we can expect in the circumstances. If it gets through, we might, just might, be able to pick the bones out of it later.\n\nHaving said they didn't want to leave without a deal, however, MPs then threw it out. Go figure.\n\nWhat happens next? As I've written before, anyone who claims to know is a liar.\n\nThe public mood has moved beyond exasperation. I've never known such despair at the antics of the political class, the courts, the pro-Remain media.\n\nInstead of action, honesty and plain speaking, all we get is self-indulgent waffle about the 'Benn Act', the 'Letwin Law', blah, blah . . .\n\nThey might as well call it the Bill And Ben Act, as the political class are all talking Flowerpot Man.\n\nFlob-a-Dob, Flob-a-Dob, Flob-a-Dob.\n\nAnd coming up after the break, it's Soubry Loo.\n\nWeeeee-eeeeed!\n\nWhether there will be a backlash if and when we are eventually allowed a General Election remains to be seen. The politicians will drag this out as long as they can, in the hope that we'll all get so bored we'll forget about it.\n\nAnd at the centre of it all struts Mr Speaker himself, a preening popinjay in love with the magnificence of his own verbosity.\n\nHe's been described as the most powerful man in Britain, since staging a coup which empowered Parliament to neuter the Prime Minister and remove the Government's ability to govern.\n\nYet Parliament has seized power without accepting responsibility. It's what Kipling called the prerogative of the harlot through the ages.\n\nWelcome to our very own Parliament of Whores.\n\nBut who, precisely, voted for that? To whom is Bercow accountable? Certainly not the electorate. Convention dictated that he was returned to Westminster unopposed.\n\nIn turn, he is supposed to remain unimpeachably impartial.\n\nYet Bercow ripped up his end of that bargain. Even his own deputy now says he is blatantly biased in favour of Remain.\n\nAnd despite the fact that he was foisted on the Tories by Labour as a kind of practical joke at the end of the Brown years, the incoming Cameron government decided not to remove him.\n\nAnother triumph for Call Me Dave.\n\nBercow is due to retire at the end of this month. But I wouldn't put money on it. He's already broken his word on standing down once before.\n\nMy guess is that he won't give up the chair until Brexit is dead and buried, even if that takes another couple of years.\n\nAll we can do is watch impotently, while Bercow and his Remainer allies trash democracy before our very eyes.\n\nThe only thing we can be sure of is that when it comes to Brexit, The Man From Del Monte, he say B@\u00a3\u00a3&%#$!", "description": "RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: To nobody's great surprise, up popped that gurning gargoyle Bercow yesterday to stymie, yet again, the latest attempt to get Brexit through the Commons.", "authors": ["Richard Littlejohn For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/23/20006790-0-image-a-52_1571697937937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
