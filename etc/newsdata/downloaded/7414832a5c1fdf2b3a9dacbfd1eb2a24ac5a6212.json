Blockbuster\u2019s plastered all over it, and rightly so. Timed-ticket sales for its one-stop run are moving right along.\n\nBut the marvelous show you actually see, honoring the 500th anniversary of Leonardo\u2019s death, is, tonally, some other thing: quieter, slower, better. It\u2019s a succession of major painterly melodies set among ink-drawn pre-echoes and reverbs . It\u2019s a confluence of presences and absences \u2014 art that\u2019s there and some that\u2019s not \u2014 both equally potent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a biographical vapor trail of a talent who has been used as a romantic model of what a Great Artist should be \u2014 large-gestured, face-to-the-sunrise \u2014 but who largely departed from that ideal, who identified himself above all as a science-wonk, who spent as much time writing as making art, and who ignored (and missed) commission deadlines almost till the day he died.\n\nThat day was May 2, 1519. And his death, at 67, happened in France, where he passed his last years as court artist to King Francis I . Leonardo\u2019s residency there helps explain why so large a percentage of his surviving works \u2014 a total of only about 15 to 20 paintings are generally attributed to his hand \u2014 ended up in Louvre\u2019s collection, which in turn helps explain why the quincentenary tribute is happening in France and not in Italy, his native land.", "description": "The marvelous survey of 160 works, including paintings, drawings and notebooks, shows the great artist\u2019s hand and mind in constant action.", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/arts/leonardo-review1/leonardo-review1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
