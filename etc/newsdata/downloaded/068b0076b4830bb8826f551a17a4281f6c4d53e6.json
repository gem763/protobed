If he did not believe 'Nick', he had decided to mislead the public.\"\n\nMr Rodhouse said he was \"sincerely sorry for the distress caused\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Met's deputy commissioner Sir Stephen House says he is \"deeply sorry for mistakes made\"\n\nSir Stephen said he was \"deeply, deeply sorry\" for the pain caused by the Met's \"serious mistakes\", although he said the force does not accept everything in the report.\n\nHe said he was conscious of the \"dreadful impact on wrongly accused individuals and their families\".\n\nSir Stephen said: \"There was a significant amount of pressure on a lot of different public bodies in relation to not taking seriously allegations around this type of assault.\n\n\"That does not excuse the mistakes made but it explains some of the thinking we had.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Labour deputy leader Tom Watson met \"Nick\" and \"created further pressure upon police\", said the report\n\nThe report also said \"there can be no doubt\" Labour MP Tom Watson \"believed Nick\" and \"created further pressure upon officers\".\n\nMr Watson - who is now the party's deputy leader - said the review \"contains multiple inaccuracies\" about him and police asked him to \"encourage the hundreds of people that came to me with stories of child abuse to report their stories to the police\".\n\nSir Richard also criticised the effect BBC journalists had upon the investigation.\n\nHe records how BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds showed Beech pictures of two boys who were either murdered or went missing in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he met him in November 2014.\n\nPolice subsequently investigated whether one of the boys - Martin Allen, who went missing in London - was one of the three boys allegedly murdered by the people Beech accused.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered a third review of the Met's investigation\n\nSir Richard records that relatives of Martin Allen were subsequently spoken to by detectives and that the \"upset caused to that family is one of several distressing aspects of this case\".\n\nThe retired judge wrote that the \"photographic identification by Symonds was fundamentally flawed and would not be admitted in a court\".\n\nHe said senior officers should have told the BBC's reporters and a retired social worker who was also working with Beech \"not to feed information to 'Nick'\".\n\nCompensation fraud\n\nSir Richard also criticised the now-defunct news website Exaro News, which also met with Beech and showed him 42 pictures of men, through which Beech identified Mr Proctor and Lord Bramall.\n\nHe said: \"There can be no doubt that 'Nick' received information and assistance from Exaro and other journalists that misled officers and contributed to their concluding at an early stage that 'Nick' was credible.\"\n\nThe report also criticised officers who helped Beech claim \u00a322,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, for which he was later convicted of fraud.\n\nSir Richard said: \"Assisting a claimant to recover compensation before an investigation is complete prejudges the outcome of the investigation and should not have happened.\n\n\"Having assisted 'Nick' to claim compensation rendered it more difficult to discontinue this investigation,\" he said.\n\nNumber 10 said the case was \"deeply concerning\" which is why Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered a third review of it.", "description": "The Met is heavily criticised for its investigation into false allegations of a VIP paedophile ring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D891/production/_108614455_carl_beech_mugshot_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
