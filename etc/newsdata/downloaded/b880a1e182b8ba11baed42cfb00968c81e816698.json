So it is a symbol of doing good for others.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera The \"deliveryman\" was seen wiping away the design with his foot.\n\nThe homeowner said his wife was upset when she saw the destroyed symbol.\n\n\u201cI was pretty calm when I saw it but my wife was devastated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe live very kindly and happily and the rangoli was a sign of welcoming all the people to the house.\n\n\u201cI tried to explain to her that the guy who did it was not wrong, but he was also not correct, because he just had a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nThe swastika has been a spiritual symbol for multiple cultures for more than 5000 years.\n\nA rotated version was appropriated by the Nazi party after World War I and became associated with the Holocaust and millions of deaths during World War II.", "description": "A deliveryman has been caught on CCTV wiping away what he appeared to think was a piece of vile neo-Nazi imagery on an Adelaide doorstep.
