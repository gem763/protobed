Certainly, the depth of gumption that he dredged up to capture his first win in seven years suggested that Padraig Harrington\u2019s team next year would be strengthened by the Belgian golfer\u2019s resurgence.\n\nThe 36-year-old resembled his 2012 self in cruising to a three-shot lead at the French Open at Le Golf National, before his recent troubles seemed to come back to plague him when he followed a brilliant chip-in eagle on the 14th with a double \u00adbogey on the 15th.\n\nBut then, he succeeded where so many Americans failed at the Versailles layout in the biennial dust-up last September, by parring the last three holes for a 72 and a 12-under total for a one-shot victory over Dane Joachim B Hansen, with South Africa\u2019s George Coetzee a further stroke back in third.\n\nDown in shocking 424th position in the world rankings, Colsaerts went into the week worried about retaining his card on Tour, but the newly married father-of-one now has his status guaranteed for two more years. His Tour nickname is \u201cThe Dude\u201d but he looked unashamed to reveal his emotions when the tears emptied on the 18th green.", "description": "Could Nicolas Colsaerts make an overdue reappearance in the Ryder Cup for Europe?", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213610236-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqs_c18eXBngJHg5-wdzAqoVqlVxgq9lZ4cPKKC-pA_G0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
