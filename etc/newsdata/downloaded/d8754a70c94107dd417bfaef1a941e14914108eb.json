It\u2019s time for management to sort this out so our members can get on with the jobs they love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are encouraged by the way negotiations with the Science Museum Group have progressed, but we are still well short of a long-term commitment to paying the real living wage.\n\n\u2018Paying the real living wage next year is welcome, but means that for several months, hundreds of workers will still be earning less than they need to survive.\n\n\u2018SMG has some of the highest profile museums in the country and it is ludicrous that they won\u2019t just start paying all their workers enough to live on, and commit to doing so in the future.\u2019\n\nThe dispute involves staff at the Science Museum in London, the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, the National Railway Museum in York and the National Collections Centre in Wroughton.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
