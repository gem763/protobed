In separate interviews at two film festivals this weekend, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig endorsed the idea of a woman taking the helm of the storied spy franchise.\n\nToday\u2019s reigning Bond, Craig, told Variety in an interview this weekend that \u201cof course\u201d the iconic spy could be played by a woman in the future. Craig made his remarks while promoting the Agatha Christie-esque murder mystery \u201cKnives Out\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival, and jokingly endorsed his co-star Jamie Lee Curtis for the role.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, at the Deauville American Film Festival in France, former 007 Pierce Brosnan wholeheartedly endorsed the idea of a woman playing Bond to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve watched the guys do it for the last 40 years, get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there,\u201d said Brosnan, who played the super spy in four films: \u201cThe World Is Not Enough,\u201d \u201cTomorrow Never Dies,\u201d \u201cGoldenEye\u201d and \u201cDie Another Day.\u201d \u201cI think it would be exhilarating, it would be exciting.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brosnan conceded that a female James Bond was unlikely, given executive producer Barbara Broccoli\u2019s insistence that \u201cBond is male.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a male character. He was written as a male and I think he\u2019ll probably stay as a male,\u201d Broccoli told the Guardian in October. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t have to turn male characters into women. Let\u2019s just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters.\u201d\n\nBrosnan told THR that, \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to happen under their watch.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the franchise isn\u2019t evolving, however. There have been rumors that the upcoming James Bond film \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d would feature actress Lashana Lynch taking over the code name of 007 even though Craig will still play the famous spy.\n\nHowever, some fans might not enjoy all of Brosnan\u2019s remarks to the trade publication.\n\nWhile Brosnan told THR that the franchise would need to change its approach to female characters because \u201cthe #MeToo movement has been relevant and significant and well needed in our society,\u201d he also praised the directing talent of Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, both of whom have been accused of sexually assaulting minors.\n\nBrosnan was asked about Polanski, who was awarded the Venice Film Festival\u2019s highest honor this week despite his conviction for raping a 13-year-old girl in the 1970s, because he had worked with the director on 2010\u2032s \u201cThe Ghost Writer.\u201d\n\nTHR reports that Brosnan dismissed questions about Polanski\u2019s appearance at Venice, saying, \u201cMr. Polanski and I have worked together, he\u2019s a brilliant filmmaker and so is Woody Allen. We celebrate them as filmmakers.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTom Hanks has a Mr. Rogers-inspired message: Please, won\u2019t you be less cynical?\n\nWant to know who will rule the upcoming awards season?
