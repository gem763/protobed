President Trump faces an unprecedented inquiry into his abuse of the vast powers of the presidency for personal gain.\n\nThe origins of Trump\u2019s constitutional predicament are firmly rooted in the president\u2019s embrace of political conspiracy theories. In an era when hyperpartisan news sources dominate political discourse, fanciful and factually challenged political narratives spread like wildfire, radicalizing millions of Americans\u2019 political leanings.\n\nIn particular, conspiracy theories surrounding the Steele dossier, the murder of Seth Rich, \u201cSpygate,\u201d \u201cPizzagate,\u201d \u201cQAnon,\u201d Benghazi, Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation, \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of illegal votes, President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, IRS \u201ctargeting,\u201d and \u201cFast and Furious\u201d among others, come to mind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThrough indoctrination by partisan media sources, lurid conspiracy theories such as these lead far too many Americans to accept false narratives of egregious corruption or, worse, that millions of their fellow citizens are actively subverting the United States. The emergence of ever-more outlandish theories only reinforces such toxic assumptions. Worst of all, facts, truth and logic die an unceremonious death as political conspiracy theories propagate via hyperpartisan \u201cnews\u201d sources and social media.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a brief examination of the conspiracy theories that precipitated President Trump\u2019s current political crisis \u2013 and the objectively false narratives that emerged in its wake \u2013 are in order.\n\nConspiracy Theory #1: The FBI investigation of Trump campaign coordination with Russia was a \u201cdeep state\u201d (or Clinton/DNC) plot to damage Trump politically.\n\nThe Reality: This is an absurdly baseless claim apparently embraced by the president himself. Worse, Trump has improperly pushed foreign leaders to discredit the well-understood origins of the FBI investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign. After years of exhaustive investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE reported that the FBI inquiry into the Trump campaign began with a tip-off from a foreign government.\n\nIn short, a Trump aide disclosed to an Australian diplomat that Russia possessed political \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonDemocrat running for Hurd's seat in Texas raises M in third quarter Ex-police chief charged with hate crime called Trump 'last hope for white people' Brent Budowsky: Deep Throat's defending our democracy MORE. This revelation prompted the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign. Of note, Mueller also reported that another foreign government (possibly Greece) relayed a similar warning to the FBI before the Australian government\u2019s tip-off. Absolutely no evidence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to entrap Trump exists.\n\nConspiracy Theory #2: Vice President (and Democratic presidential candidate) Joe Biden Joe BidenHarris presses Twitter to 'do something' over Trump's 'coup' tweet Poll: 40 percent of Republicans say Trump 'probably' mentioned Biden on Ukraine call Pompeo, House chairmen clash in impeachment fight MORE and his son Hunter Biden, or both, engaged in corrupt activities in Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Reality: This conspiracy theory is completely unfounded. The former Ukrainian prosecutor general has stated that there is no evidence of illegal activity by the Bidens and no grounds to investigate either of them. Perhaps most importantly, had Hunter Biden engaged in corrupt activities in Ukraine, Vice President Biden\u2019s push to remove an ineffective Ukrainian prosecutor general would have potentially placed his son in legal jeopardy.\n\nConspiracy Theory #3: Joe Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukraine to remove the prosecutor investigating the company that hired his son.\n\nThe Reality: The investigation into the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter Biden was inactive when the younger Biden began working at the company. Separately, allegations of wrongdoing by the company\u2019s CEO predate Hunter Biden\u2019s hiring.\n\nMoreover, America\u2019s NATO allies, Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, and the International Monetary Fund all urged the firing of the ineffective Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden ultimately persuaded the Ukrainian government to dismiss. In short, Joe Biden should be commended for prompting the removal of an ineffective prosecutor in a country riddled with corruption.\n\nConspiracy Theory #4: Ukraine mounted a coordinated effort to interfere in the 2016 election on behalf of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Reality: Ukrainian \u201cinterference\u201d in the 2016 election centered on the release of documents detailing massive corruption by Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortHouse Democrats suggest Trump may have lied to Mueller about WikiLeaks contacts Ukraine scandal shows that foreign influence is a bipartisan affair Let's get real: Democrats were first to enlist Ukraine in US elections MORE. Right-wing pundits (and President Trump) are absolutely right that political corruption by an American occurred in Ukraine; the only problem is that the perpetrator (Manafort) served at the very top of the Trump campaign. Instead of criticizing Ukraine\u2019s actions in 2016, Americans should thank the Ukrainian government for bringing Manafort\u2019s illegal activities to light. Not only did they force Manafort\u2019s resignation, the associated scrutiny assisted U.S. law enforcement agencies in bringing Trump\u2019s campaign manager to justice. Manafort is currently serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence in federal prison.\n\nConspiracy Theory #5: As part of a massive Ukrainian plot to interfere in the 2016 election on behalf of Hillary Clinton, a Ukrainian-linked cybersecurity firm falsely accused Russia of hacking Democratic National Committee servers.\n\nThe Reality: The director of national intelligence, CIA, FBI, NSA, special counsel Robert Mueller, numerous congressional committees and private cybersecurity companies affirm that Russia hacked the DNC as part of a sweeping plot to interfere in the 2016 elections. Trump, on the other hand, has openly questioned the U.S. government\u2019s unambiguous conclusions, most notably while standing immediately next to Russian President Putin.\n\nMoreover, the FBI was satisfied with the forensic data that it received from CrowdStrike, the IT security firm that analyzed the DNC\u2019s servers. In his call with the Ukrainian president, Trump peddled the widely debunked conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike is linked to the Ukrainian government or to Ukrainian \u201cwealthy people.\u201d CrowdStrike is an American company based in Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nConspiracy Theory #6: Whistleblower reporting requirements were altered to accommodate allegations of wrongdoing by Trump.\n\nThe Reality: The intelligence community inspector general (a Trump appointee) has forcefully rejected such claims. The reporting form and guidelines have not been altered since mid-2018, a full year before Trump corruptly sought to persuade his Ukrainian counterpart to open a corruption investigation into his chief political rival in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nConspiracy Theory #7: In suddenly halting years of military aid to Ukraine shortly before asking the Ukrainian president for a political \u201cfavor,\u201d Trump claimed that Europe was not contributing enough resources to support the Ukrainian government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Reality: European countries and financial institutions have contributed over $16 billion in aid to Ukraine since 2014. By comparison, the U.S. has contributed $1.5 billion in security assistance over the same period.\n\nConspiracy Theory #8: Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffPompeo, House chairmen clash in impeachment fight Trump says he's becoming victim of a 'coup' Overnight Defense: State approves M weapons sale to Ukraine | Pompeo rejects Dem demands for officials' testimony | Dems worry about whistleblower's safety | US, North Korea to hold talks MORE (D-Calif.) lied to Congress and to the American public in an opening statement on the whistleblower allegations (and should be arrested for treason for doing so).\n\nThe Reality: Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, parodied the call to illustrate how Trump improperly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Biden\u2019s son for Trump\u2019s political gain. In his opening statement, Schiff clearly stated that the transcript of Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president \u201creads like a classic organized crime shakedown.\u201d Following his parody, Schiff further stated that \u201cThis is, in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.\u201d\n\nConspiracy Theory #9: The whistleblower\u2019s allegations of corruption by President Trump have no merit because they were not witnessed first-hand.\n\nThe Reality: Not only is \u201cfirst-hand\u201d knowledge not required by law, the whistleblower\u2019s allegations of corruption by Trump are in perfect alignment with the evidence released to date.\n\nThe litany of conspiracy theories outlined above presents a true threat to the United States. For one, President Trump\u2019s embrace of such absurd narratives allows Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinUkraine agrees to local elections in separatist eastern region Kremlin says Russian consent needed to release Trump-Putin phone calls The Memo: Will impeachment create an even more polarized nation? MORE to realize peak return on investment in his gamble to sow political and social discord in the U.S.\n\nEqually damaging is the GOP\u2019s stalwart defense of Trump in the face of such indefensibly bogus claims. As Sen. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTo win the federal paid family leave debate, allow states to lead the way Democrat argues GOP had 'no deep love or loyalty' to Trump Flake tells GOP: Trump 'does not deserve reelection' MORE (R-Utah) aptly noted, continued Republican cover of Trump in light of the objective truth lays bare the lengths to which Republicans will go to \u201cpreserve\u201d and \u201cmaintain\u201d their power.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the U.S. Department of Defense.", "description": "Continued Republican cover of Trump in light of the objective truth lays bare, as Senator Mitt Romney aptly identified, the lengths that Republicans will go to \u201cpreserve\u201d and \u201cmaintain\u201d their power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_093019_0.jpg"}
