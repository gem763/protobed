LeBron started at point guard with Avery Bradley and Danny Green on the wing. But once Rondo gets healthy, he\u2019ll start with LeBron shifting back to forward and Bradley presumably coming off the bench.\n\nLakers coach Frank Vogel, via Dave McMenamin of ESPN:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given it a lot of thought and I think he\u2019ll be in the starting lineup a lot,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of Rondo after practice Thursday. \u201cI definitely envision a lot of games where he\u2019ll be the starting point guard.\u201d\n\nVogel said there still could be games where Rondo comes off the bench and Bradley starts, depending on matchups.\n\nOn one hand, this seems like an overreaction to a single game against a team many \u2013 myself included \u2013 picked to win the championship. On the other hand, teams shouldn\u2019t stick to a plan just because it\u2019s already in place.\n\nThe Lakers could use better ball movement, and Rondo should help. He showed a nice ability to set up Anthony Davis with the Pelicans. However, Davis has since expanded his all-around game, improving his ability to create for himself and others.\n\nLos Angeles also needs better spacing, and Rondo is a liability on the perimeter \u2013 a key reason he has fit so poorly with LeBron. That\u2019ll remain an issue for a guard in a post-up offense.\n\nRondo\u2019s defense is suspect, too. Bradley applies more pressure on the ball.\n\nThe Lakers have many distinctive pieces to fit together. I\u2019m unconvinced starting Rondo is the answer, but it\u2019s also difficult to envision an optimized rotation. Vogel should keep experimenting like this.", "description": "Once Rajon Rondo gets healthy, he'll start with LeBron shifting back to forward and Bradley presumably coming off the bench.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lkdQVHrCZCxCl0A3U2bt6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjMuMzk2Nzc4OTE2NTQ0Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TyhhukiG3pNejQnqSeaXtw--~B/aD0zODY7dz02ODM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/56d1d91d0e5a23bbda31b786aaa53f11", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
