About half of these employees provide investment advisory services, up nearly 5% over 2018.\n\n\u201cOur profession is experiencing continued growth as increasing numbers of investors recognize the value of fiduciary advisors,\u201d IAA President and CEO Karen Barr said in a statement.\n\nAssets under management across the RIA channel grew $1.2 trillion in 2018, or 1.4% year over year, but growth of assets is slowing compared with past years, likely a function of stock market performance, according to Wealth Management. For instance, in 2015, assets grew 8%, and in 2018 were up nearly 17% from 2017. Since 2001, total industry assets have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8.2%, the report states.\n\nThe majority of AUM are concentrated among a small group of large advisors. While they account for only 1.1% of SEC-registered advisors, the 148 RIA firms managing over $100 billion account for nearly 60% of industry assets. About seven in 10 RIAs manage less than $1 billion in assets, and they account for just 3.1% of all AUM.\n\n-- John Kimelman", "description": "While head count is up, asset growth is slowing, according to the Investment Adviser Association and NRS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107479/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
