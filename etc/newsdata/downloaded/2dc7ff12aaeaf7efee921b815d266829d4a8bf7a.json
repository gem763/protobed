Man Throws Brick At A Car, It Bounces Back & Hits Him In The Face!\n\nYou know how they say 'what goes around comes around'? Well, here is an example of that.\n\nIn a hilarious turn of events, a man threw a brick at a car, which bounced back and hit him in the face. Whether it was instant karma or just bad luck, we're not quite sure. But it is funny. The amusing video of the incident has gone viral on social media.\n\nThe incident was captured on a CCTV camera of the house in Brandon, Durham. The video shows a man wearing a black hoodie, walking past a car. He then comes back, picks up the brick from the ground and hurls it at the car.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nA 40-year-old man hurled a brick at a specially adapted disabled car - but it bounced back and hit him in the face. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\n\nThe police later arrested him for criminal damage. #karma pic.twitter.com/pNtUgTDrQM \u2014 Ben Claimant (@imajsaclaimant) October 11, 2019\n\nHe then throws a brick at the car\u2019s windshield and if you notice in the video, the prankster throws the brick at the edge of the gate and windshield, it obviously bounces back! The brick hits the car and bounces back at him, hitting him hard, right in the face. Might we say, ouch!\n\nThe man then keeps his hands on his face, in pain. Thinking it to be useless, he finally picks up the brick and throws it in the garden next door and walks away.\n\nDon't Miss 421 SHARES 150 SHARES 4.6 K SHARES\n\nThe man whose house\u2019s CCTV camera recorded the incident said, \"Just scratches to glass and paint work.

Think that's karma for you,\" he told Mirror.\n\nThe video went viral on social media with over 254.3 k views and people just cannot stop laughing.
