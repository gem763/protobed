The Astros went down in order an inning later to drop the series opener.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile a big boost for his team\u2019s chances, Springer\u2019s RBI double also presented an awkward question. It\u2019s not often you hear this asked about a player who accounted for half his team\u2019s RBIs on separate hits, but could Springer have done more? Like, say tie the game?\n\nIt seems possible, though the player denied it after the game.\n\nGeorge Springer isn't running in this picture. Some people had problems with that. (Tim Warner/Getty Images)\n\nGeorge Springer didn\u2019t exactly run to first base\n\nPlenty of people at Minute Maid Park seemed to think Springer had just hit a game-tying homer as the ball soared through the air. One of those people was Springer, who basically galloped to first base rather than run while watching where the ball landed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s significant because, well, Springer ended up on second base despite the ball hanging in the air, getting mishandled by a jumping Adam Eaton, having to get run down by Victor Robles and thrown into the infield. It took nearly 12 seconds from when Springer made contact for the ball to make it to shortstop Trea Turner at second base.\n\nSpringer is not a slow player, so many wondered if he could have gotten a triple just by hustling out of the box. It\u2019s not the first time such a question has come up this postseason. Had Springer reached third, he could have possibly scored an Altuve\u2019s lineout a batter later.\n\nSpringer addressed the matter after the game, saying he would have \u201dfor sure\u201d been out of third if he tried for a triple and he might have passed Tucker on the basepaths.\n\nGeorge Springer on his eighth-inning double: \u201cI don\u2019t want to necessarily run as fast as I can because, for some reason, if he tags or whatever the case and I run by him, it\u2019s not good. I was watching the outfielder\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I had gone to third, I\u2019m out. I'm out for sure\" \u2014 Chandler Rome (@Chandler_Rome) October 23, 2019\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not exactly the question we\u2019re dealing with here. Springer would have definitely been thrown out if he went for a triple, what we want to know is what would have happened had he just run out of the box on contact.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to truly know that, but there are reasons to give Springer the benefit of the doubt. First, the announcers noted that Tucker held up at second base until the ball landed, so Springer might have been blocked from reaching third even if he sprinted out of the box.\n\nAlso significant is that \u201cnearly 12 seconds\u201d isn\u2019t the time of an easy triple. It\u2019s the time of a Mike Trout triple. Had Tucker not been an obstacle and had Robles gotten the ball in quicker (Springer had little way of knowing Robles needed to run down the ball), Springer might have been in trouble. It\u2019s tempting to say that Springer \u2014 who had already done plenty for the Astros \u2014 should have easily been on third, but there was enough in his way that you just can\u2019t know for certain.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "George Springer hit what looked like a homer, then turned into a double.
