For Shaheen Bhatt, daughter of Mahesh Bhatt, this challenge was fought with utmost bravery.\n\nTalking about her own depression, she had written,\n\nInstagram\n\n\u201cThe first time I felt it, I was twelve and approaching my 13th birthday. I thought that the niggling feelings of unease creeping up on me had to do with the fact that I had recently gained a lot of weight and was being teased for it at school. So, l spent 4 months starving myself and lost all the weight before my 13th birthday rolled around. Surprise surprise: not only did those painful, uneasy feelings stay put, they got worse with every passing day. I spent a lot of time oblivious and unaware that those feelings could be something more. I spent a lot time in denial when I learned they were something more.\u201d\n\nAfter penning down her book on her experience with depression, she has now started an initiative to support people struggling with mental illness. She took to social media to make people aware of it. She wrote,\n\n\u201c@herecomesthesunofficial #HereComesTheSun was born from a simple idea. The idea that we are not alone. None of us are alone in our struggles and journeys with mental health- we all have the same fears and we all hope for the same things.
