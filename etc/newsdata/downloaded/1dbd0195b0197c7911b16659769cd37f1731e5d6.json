PayPal, where David Marcus used to be president, was the first to leave withdrawing its support earlier this month.\n\nAlthough the future of Facebook\u2018s \u2018cryptocurrency\u2018 has been called into question many times, and it\u2019s made regulators and central banks uneasy, Marcus took to Twitter to reassure the public that the outcome of this latest meeting had been positive.\n\n1/ Awesome day today at our inaugural Libra Association member council! It was energizing to see reps from many different industries, and interests come together with one mission at heart, improve access and lower costs to digital money and financial services for everyone. \u2014 David Marcus (@davidmarcus) October 14, 2019\n\n2/ We\u2019re now 1 out of 21 official members (and many more to come), and I\u2019m honored to have been voted in alongside four awesome board members: @katie_haun (@a16z), @wences (@xapo), Patrick Ellis (PayU), and Matthew Davie (@Kiva). Onward! \u2014 David Marcus (@davidmarcus) October 14, 2019\n\nUnsurprisingly, Marcus has been vocal about the project\u2018s viability, recently speaking out against a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article that suggested Mastercard was looking to pull out of the project \u2013 which of course we now know it did.\n\nAt the time, Marcus didn\u2019t explicitly deny the overall thread of the WSJ piece, but said the initial (and official) group of Libra\u2018s partners \u201cwill be formalized in weeks to come.\u201d\n\nLibra\u2018s future may remain uncertain, and while it still has to overcome several challenges, at least we now have some clarity as to who\u2019s behind it.", "description": "Facebook has managed to officially sign up 21 organizations to its Libra Association following several high-profile departures from its controversial \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 project.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-24.jpg&signature=4a8d4f755823e5ccb55ae83518551419", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
