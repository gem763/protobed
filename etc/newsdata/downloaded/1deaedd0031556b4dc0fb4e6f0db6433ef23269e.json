Goodbye, Freedom Man.", "language": "en", "text": "Trump\u2019s withdrawal will do worse than that.\n\nIt will put thousands of Kurdish lives in jeopardy. It will deepen Tehran\u2019s influence in Syria. It will increase the likelihood of all-out war between Israel and Iran. It will underscore the inefficacy of U.S. sanctions to curb Tehran\u2019s ambitions. It will ratify the wisdom of Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to intervene on Assad\u2019s behalf. It will strengthen Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s hand, not only in northern Syria but also in Turkish politics, just as he was finally beginning to experience serious reversals after 16 years in power.\n\nAnd it will fundamentally jeopardize the gains made against the Islamic State, around 10,000 of whose fighters are in the custody of the Kurdish forces now being attacked. As Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told Bloomberg\u2019s Eli Lake, \u201cIf we think the Turkish operation will not stop, we cannot fight ISIS anymore.\u201d\n\nTrump thus repeats Barack Obama\u2019s mistake in Iraq of declaring success, pulling out, and creating the security and political vacuums which ISIS, Iran, and other bad actors were quick to fill. That alone should have been enough to dissuade this president from pursuing his course.\n\nExcept that Trump\u2019s instinctive need to appease dictators appears to be even more powerful than his aversion to imitating his predecessor. Distracting attention from impeachment surely played a role, too, based on the view that ending \u201cstupid endless wars\u201d is generally a political winner \u2014 at least until the consequences of our geopolitical fecklessness are again felt fatally at home.\n\nAll of which makes it noteworthy that Trump\u2019s Kurdish betrayal has elicited such a political backlash, including among some of his more reliable lackeys in the Republican caucus. People like Senator Lindsey Graham understand that what the U.S. is now doing isn\u2019t simply foreign policy folly. It\u2019s a national disgrace.\n\nIt\u2019s a signal that Americans are the friends you never want: there for you when, and only when, it\u2019s convenient for them. It\u2019s evidence that our moral values are tissue paper around the glass fragments of our president\u2019s ego. It\u2019s proof that the idealism that stormed Normandy, fed Europe, democratized Japan, and kept West Berlin free belongs to an increasingly remote past.\n\nIt means that American sailor or soldier seen on the horizon is no longer \u201cfreedom man.\u201d He\u2019s fair-weather friend.\n\nEven now, this is not how most Americans, including many of Trump\u2019s supporters, would wish to see themselves. People on their way to the bottom have their occasional moments of clarity, seldom seized. In the Syria debacle, Republicans have a chance to see, if not save, themselves.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
