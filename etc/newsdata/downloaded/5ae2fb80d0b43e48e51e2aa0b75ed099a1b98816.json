Subject to getting it written,' said Trump in the Oval Office of what he described as phase one.\n\nThe first phase includes agricultural purchases, ownership interests and some aspects of intellectual property and technology transfer rights.\n\nTrump said he expects to sign the paperwork at a Chilean summit in mid-November that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping both plan to attend.\n\nHe declared his trade deal to be a matter of 'world peace' and described trade talks as a 'love-fest' between the two nations, while congratulating the country on 70 years of communism.\n\nThe president firmly denied discussing Joe Biden and his son Hunter with Xi's emissary, saying as he did earlier in the week that it's up to China to launch an investigation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Liu He, the vice premier of China, for a new round of trade talks\n\nTrump said on Sept. 20 at a news conference that he did not want a 'partial' trade deal with China. Yet, that is what he settled for on Friday afternoon.\n\nHe said phase one 'should happen pretty quickly' in the next several weeks.\n\n'So we're very happy with it. We have great respect for China, great respect for President Xi,' he said.\n\nIn the meantime, he said tariffs would not be increasing from 25 percent to 30 percent later this month, in preparation for the deal he said he's confident he'll get.\n\n'Yeah, I think we're very close,' he said. 'I think this is a very important phase.'\n\nIt is not a firm deal, though, he admitted: 'No it's subject to getting everything papered.'\n\nHe told press that he made no requests, related to the Bidens, in the talks with the Chinese.\n\n'I have not brought up Joe Biden,' he said. 'China can do whatever they want with respect to the Bidens.'\n\nHe added, 'But we do have to look into corruption but no it has not been brought up.'\n\nEarlier, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hinted that Trump would have an announcement to make.\n\n'I wouldn't be surprised if like usual he decides to invite a few of you in,' Mnuchin told reporters, 'but I'm not going to make any other comments in advance of us meeting,'\n\nFinancial markets, highly sensitive to the ups and downs of the U.S.-China economic relationship, surged on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up, more than 480 points, or 1.9 per cent, in afternoon trading.\n\nAsked about the trading rally, the treasury chief quipped: 'The stock market's always right.'\n\nLiu shook hands with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer after a minister-level trade meeting at the Office of the United States Trade Representative in Washington on Friday\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin briefed reporters for six minutes on Friday, saying Trump would meet with Liu but refusing to forecast the result\n\nStocks rose sharply on Friday as traders showed optimism about the economic impact of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war\n\nBeijing's vice premier is in Washington leading the 13th round of negotiations with Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Expectations for a major breakthrough in the 15-month standoff are still low.\n\nThe two sides are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration's assertions that China steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a sharp-elbowed drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.\n\nBeijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China's aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.\n\n'There are deep underlying issues to be resolved,' said Alexis Crow, who leads the geopolitical investing practice at the consulting firm PwC. Increasingly, she said, the administration sees China 'as an enemy, not a partner. I don't see that approach disappearing.'\n\nBut hopes are growing that the two countries can at least reach a cease-fire through a so-called mini-deal that would lower U.S.-China tensions and suspend Trump's plans to raise existing tariffs on Chinese goods and impose new ones. The talks had stalled in May after the administration accused Beijing of reneging on earlier commitments.\n\n'China came to Washington prepared to put some things on the table,' said Robert Holleyman, a former deputy U.S. trade representative who is now a partner at the Crowell & Moring law firm. 'They want to do something that gets these negotiations back on track.'\n\nBeijing could agree to buy more farm products from the United States or act to address concerns that it manipulates the Chinese currency to gain an unfair edge in export markets, analysts say.\n\nProgress in the talks might prompt the administration to delay plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports on Tuesday and to impose new import taxes on an additional $160 billion of goods on Dec. 15 - a move that would extend sanctions to just about everything China ships the United States. (China is taxing about $120 billion in American products.)\n\nLiu met Thursday with leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council. Liu told them that the Chinese negotiators 'come with great sincerity' and were ready to discuss the trade balance, market access and investor protection, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nThe report made no mention of any willingness to discuss Chinese industrial and technology policy.\n\nLiu He shook hands with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday\n\nAlways thorny, the U.S.-China relationship has been complicated by growing concern that Chinese firms like the telecommunications giant Huawei pose a national security threat, not just an economic one. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Huawei, warning that its equipment can be used for cyberespionage.\n\nTrump has suggested that easing the sanctions on Huawei could be a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations - a move that would likely encounter resistance in Congress.\n\n'A China mini deal?' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted Friday. 'It must not include concessions on Huawei. That's what China wants most, and it would show tremendous weakness.'\n\nBut Trump tweeted that a U.S.-China agreement does 'not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!'\n\nThe U.S.-China tariff war is taking an economic toll, especially on American manufacturers, which face higher costs and uncertainty over when and how the hostilities will end. A private survey found last week that U.S. factory output dropped in September to the lowest level since the recession year 2009.", "description": "Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, briefing reporters about a new authorization for economic sanctions against Turkey, said negotiators 'have had a productive two days of discussions.'", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent", "David Martosko", "U.S Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19603438-0-image-a-66_1570821569723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
