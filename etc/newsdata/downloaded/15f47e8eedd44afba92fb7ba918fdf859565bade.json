Cummings, who died last week, Mr. Obama never mentioned the president by name but seemed to draw a contrast between his successor and the congressman whom Mr. Trump denigrated last summer.\n\nMr. Obama said that Mr. Cummings showed that being strong meant being kind and that being honorable was no flaw.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about kindness and compassion,\u201d Mr. Obama told a packed hall at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, which Mr. Cummings, a Democrat, represented in the House for the past 25 years. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about looking out for others. There\u2019s nothing weak about being honorable. You\u2019re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.\u201d", "description": "The former president said that Representative Elijah E.
