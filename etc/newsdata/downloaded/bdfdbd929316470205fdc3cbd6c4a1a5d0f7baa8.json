The best team won and it wasn't us. I am very proud of this team and how they carry themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"I think people should take a deep breath and let it go.\n\n\"Everyone is hurting. These are not easy days.\"", "description": "New Zealand boss rules out Gatland for All Blacks coach", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9Q0W0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
