(AP) - The Jacksonville Jaguars have added rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew to the injury report with right shoulder soreness sustained in last week\u2019s victory against the New York Jets.\n\nThe team listed Minshew as a full participant in practice Wednesday and said he took 100% of his normal repetitions. His addition to the injury report is considered precautionary, and he\u2019s expected to play when the Jaguars (4-4) play a \u201chome game\u201d against AFC South rival Houston (5-3) in London on Sunday.\n\nMinshew is 4-3 as a starter since replacing Nick Foles (broken collarbone) in the season opener.
