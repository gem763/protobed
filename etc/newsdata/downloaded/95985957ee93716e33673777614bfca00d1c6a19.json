It could have gone their way again,\" he said.\n\n\"I have so much respect for Wales and their coach that I thought those last few minutes, they might pull it through again. I think a little bit of luck (was) on our side,\" the coach said.\n\nAsked if he had regained some respect for South African rugby, which was in the doldrums when he took over, Erasmus said: \"We're in the final of the World Cup. I guess that's some respect but that's only halfway there. We'd love to win the World Cup.\"\n\nHe described final opponents England as \"classy\" after they dismantled reigning champions New Zealand 19-7 in the other semi-final on Saturday.\n\nAnd Erasmus also paid tribute to his substitutes and a ferocious defensive effort that keep Wales out as the clock ticked down.\n\n\"Those kind of things really gel a team together and those moments count,\" he said.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland said the Springboks \"deserved to win\" after his side failed to topple South Africa for the third time in a World Cup match.\n\n\"We never gave up and we got ourselves back into the game. It was a real arm-wrestle,\" said Gatland after the kick-dominated and error-strewn match.\n\nHowever, Gatland, who is stepping down after 12 years in charge, paid tribute to Wales which he said \"punches massively above our weight in terms of playing numbers\".\n\n\"They've given us 100 percent. They continue to do so. We got ourselves back in that game tonight. Really close contest,\" said Gatland.", "description": "Rassie Erasmus warned his Springboks team they were only \"halfway\" there after edging a \"nerve-wracking\" semi-final against Wales to set up a World Cup final with England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2876/e631ce0641aa42efaa276197f90104b5.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
