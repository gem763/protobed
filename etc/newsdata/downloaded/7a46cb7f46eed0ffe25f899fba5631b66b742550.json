Some old irrevocable trusts that have been in effect for decades might have to be revised by trustees to address exorbitant health-care costs, while new ones should be carefully drafted to limit expenses.\n\nHealth-care costs have been rising at more than twice the pace of inflation for decades for folks with average needs. Factor in a chronic illness or catastrophic disabling accident\u2014or even just old age\u2014and costs skyrocket. According to a 2017 Fidelity Investments study, couples will spend an average $285,000 on health care in retirement, and that\u2019s after taxes and doesn\u2019t factor in long-term care expenses. All-in health-care costs in retirement could easily exceed $1 million for high-net-worth individuals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s standard to set up a trust for health care, education, maintenance, and support,\u201d says Dan Griffith, senior vice president and regional trust manager at Huntington Private Bank. \u201cBut when you have individuals living longer, or in their second marriages with kids from their first marriages, it becomes more and more important to be very specific about how you use trusts to address health care.\u201d\n\n\u201c A yoga retreat in Bali may be a de-stressor, but is it an appropriate health-care cost? \u201d \u2014Brad Dillon\n\nWealthy folks already are accustomed to addressing soaring education costs in trusts. But health care is far more sensitive\u2014would you want to cap a sick child\u2019s payouts for medical treatments?\u2014and costs are unpredictable.\n\nDefine What Health Care Means\n\nIn an age when health can be tended to with indulgences like a $10,000 weeklong wellness retreat in the Maldives, it\u2019s easy to imagine a beneficiary trying to stretch the limits of what can be classified as a health-care expense.\n\nDefine what kinds of health-care expenses your trust is intended to cover. \u201cA yoga retreat in Bali may be a de-stressor, but is it an appropriate health-care cost?\u201d says Brad Dillon, director of fiduciary tax and trusts at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want a trustee to make that decision on a trust that\u2019s three or four generations old,\u201d Dillon says.\n\nAvoid Setting Dollar Caps\n\nSetting a dollar limit on how much a trust will pay for health care each year may seem smart now, but it may cause trouble in years ahead. Instead, trusts can require that beneficiaries attempt to contain costs without compromising care. \u201cThe difference between medicine A and medicine B can be $2,000 a month,\u201d Griffith says.\n\nRevisit Old Trusts\n\nIt used to be common to set up a so-called pot trust\u2014a single trust for multiple beneficiaries, intended to cover their general needs for their lifetimes. Given exorbitant health-care costs, the potential problem with this trust structure isn\u2019t hard to predict: Assets can potentially be sopped up by the needs of a single ailing family member.\n\nContemporary estate planning avoids this by setting up one trust per beneficiary. But existing pot trusts are creating challenges for some beneficiaries, especially as they age. An imbalance in needs for trust assets may be cause for dividing the trust between beneficiaries, Dillon says.\n\nConsider Beneficiaries\u2019 Ages\n\nWhile dividing assets evenly through multiple trusts can be best for adult beneficiaries, for dependent children consider setting up a single trust that pays out for their health care and other needs\u2014no matter how imbalanced, says Joshua Rubenstein, the national head of the trusts and estates practice at Katten Muchin Rosenman.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to say that until your youngest children are adults, all the money stays in a common pot and everybody\u2019s expenses get paid if you die early\u2014which is what would happen when you\u2019re alive,\u201d Rubenstein says.\n\nOnce they\u2019re adults, it\u2019s time to discuss plans to avoid surprises later on. \u201cBeneficiaries don\u2019t have to know everything about your finances, but they should understand the general plan.\u201d", "description": "Older trusts may need to be revised, while new ones should consider potentially rising expenses", "authors": ["Karen Hube", "Brad Dillon"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-99966/social", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
