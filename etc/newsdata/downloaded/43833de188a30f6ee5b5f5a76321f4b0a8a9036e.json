(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and his team are distorting the facts in explaining the administration's decision to stop California from setting its own emission standards for cars and trucks.\n\nThe move announced this week revokes California's authority to set auto mileage standards stricter than those issued by federal regulators. The administration argues it would result in less expensive, safer cars, and that electric cars are financially inaccessible to most Americans. U.S. automakers contend that without a substantial increase in fuel efficiency, their vehicles will be less competitive globally, potentially resulting in job losses.\n\nA look at the administration's claims and reality:\n\nANDREW WHEELER, administrator of the EPA, criticizing electric cars: It's \"a product ... which most families cannot approach.\" \u2014 remarks Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: His argument that electric cars are too expensive for most Americans is overstated.\n\nIn a speech earlier this week, Wheeler cited a McKinsey & Co. analysis from March 2019 that found electric cars cost about $12,000 more per vehicle to manufacture than a comparable gasoline powered car.\n\nBut for a new electric car, that price gap is often largely off-set by the lower operating and maintenance costs over time. Tesla is the top-selling electric brand in the nation.\n\nFederal tax credits for new electric vehicle purchases range from $2,500 to $7,500 per vehicle, depending on the model and battery capacity, though the credits are no longer available on General Motors and Tesla vehicles. Many states also offer additional incentives for EV purchasers, from tax rebates for the car and home charging equipment to the free use of commuter toll lanes.\n\nEV drivers also don't have to fill up at the gas pump, pay for oil changes or replace timing belts or spark plugs. A 2018 study from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found that electric vehicles cost less than half as much to operate as gas-powered cars \u2014 $485 per year for EVs compared to $1,117 for gasoline-powered models. So over 10 years, an EV driver will save another $6,320.\n\nWheeler, a former fossil fuels lobbyist, has also suggested it's mostly wealthy people who buy new electric cars, citing 2016 figures showing that of the roughly 57,000 households that received the EV tax credit, nearly 80% had at least a six-figure income.\n\nSetting aside that wealthier households are generally more likely to buy new cars than poorer families, in 2016 the top-selling EV was the Tesla Model S, a luxury sedan with a more than $71,000 sticker price. But in recent years, several more economical models have come on the market and the prices of the batteries that power EVs have fallen. For 2018, the best-selling EV was the less-expensive Tesla Model 3, which currently has a base sticker price of about $37,000. That's below the $39,500 average U.S. sticker price of new vehicles cited by Wheeler.\n\nThe range of electric cars is growing to where many will be able to travel more than 300 miles on a single charge. McKinsey, the management consulting firm, predicts that battery and other costs will fall to about the same as gasoline engines in three to five years.\n\n___\n\nWHEELER, on electric cars: It's \"a product that has minimal impact on the environment.\" \u2014 remarks Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not so. Wheeler's argument that electric vehicles provide little environmental benefit appears rooted in that EVs make up just 1% of new vehicle sales. But when comparing car to car, EVs on average have a far smaller carbon footprint than a gas-powered car, even for households where their electricity primarily comes from dirtier coal-fired power plants.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, a gas-powered passenger vehicle emits on average about 11,435 pounds of planet warming carbon dioxide per year. EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, so their carbon footprint comes from how the electricity charging them is sourced.\n\nSo, if the power is coming from sources such as hydroelectric dams, wind turbines or solar panels, the carbon footprint is much lower than for electricity generated by burning fossil fuels. Nationally, according to DOE estimates , that averages out to about 4,352 pounds of CO2 equivalent per year \u2014 less than half the average for gasoline vehicles.\n\nStory continues", "description": "President Donald Trump and his team are distorting the facts in explaining the administration's decision to stop California from setting its own emission standards for cars and trucks.
