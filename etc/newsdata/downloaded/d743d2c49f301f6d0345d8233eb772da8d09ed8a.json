He has broken into the England team and continued his good form this season with three goals in the opening seven league games for Dortmund.\n\nHaaland, son of former Manchester City, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest defender Alfe-Inge Haaland joined Salzburg in January 2019.\n\nThe 19-year-old has starred in the Austrian Bundesliga and Champions League, almost helping the side to a famous comeback against Liverpool in a game they lost 4-3.\n\nHaaland's current contract at Salzburg runs until the summer of 2023, but it is difficult to envisage him staying at the club for the duration of his deal if he continues to perform to such a high standard.", "description": "Real Madrid are set for a big push in the transfer market and are eyeing both Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland.
