Joi Ito, director of the Media Lab, resigned Saturday, according to MIT President L. Rafael Reif.\n\nThe article contains \u201cdeeply disturbing allegations about the engagement between individuals at the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d wrote President Reif in a letter to the MIT community. \u201cBecause the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation.\u201d\n\nMr. Reif asked the institute\u2019s general counsel to hire a law firm to conduct the investigation.\n\nLater Saturday, Mr. Ito resigned from his seat on the board of directors of the New York Times Co. , a position he had held since 2012, the company said.\n\nMr. Ito didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Epstein died Aug. 10 in a New York federal jail cell of what a coroner said was a suicide. He had pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking counts arising from a scheme federal prosecutors said involved sexual abuse of dozens of girls.\n\nIn 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to two counts related to prostitution.\n\nMIT previously said that it had received about $800,000 from foundations controlled by Mr. Epstein. The New Yorker article said that Mr. Ito disclosed this week that he had received an additional $1.2 million from Mr. Epstein for investment funds he controlled, in addition to $525,000 Mr. Epstein donated to the lab.\n\nAdditionally, the article said Mr. Epstein helped secure at least $7.5 million in donations from wealthy donors and organizations, citing records and accounts from current and former faculty and staff of the lab.\n\nMIT was also aware of Mr. Epstein\u2019s history of pleading guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution, which disqualified him as a donor for the institution, according to the New Yorker. The article also reported that Mr. Ito and other lab employees worked to hide Mr. Epstein\u2019s donations and efforts to solicit donations from other individuals.\n\n\u201cThe acceptance of the Epstein gifts involved a mistake of judgment,\u201d Mr. Reif wrote in his letter. \u201cWe are actively assessing how best to improve our policies, processes and procedures to fully reflect MIT\u2019s values and prevent such mistakes in the future.\u201d\n\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "description": "The director of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned following the publication of a news report detailing his ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his donations to the highly esteemed institution.", "authors": ["Joseph De Avila", "Joseph.Deavila Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105054/social", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
