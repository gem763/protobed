We Just Live in It.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s so metaphorical!\u201d Kim Ki-woo exclaims early in \u201cParasite,\u201d Bong Joon Ho\u2019s new film. Ki-woo is the college-aged son of one of the two families \u2014 the impoverished Kims and the wealthy Parks \u2014 whose fates entwine with horrible and hilarious results. He uses the phrase a few times, most notably with reference to the large, decorative \u201clandscape rock\u201d that is a gift from a better-off friend. In the interpretation of \u201cParasite\u201d that emphasizes the movie\u2019s fairy-tale aspects, the stone brings good fortune to Ki-woo, his sister and their parents, even as, like so many magical objects, it also curses them. (Spoilers follow, for \u201cParasite\u201d and other Bong movies.)\n\nBefore long, Ki-woo stops talking about metaphors. Maybe because things start getting real. He takes a job tutoring the Parks\u2019 teenage daughter, Da-hye, and pretty soon his whole family is employed, under dubious premises and fake identities, in the Park household. His sister, pretending to be a highly trained art therapist, starts working with Da-hye\u2019s younger brother, Da-song. The Kim patriarch, Ki-taek, replaces the chauffeur who drives Mr. Park to and from his fancy tech job. Kim Chung-sook, the mother of the clan (a former Olympic-level hammer-thrower), takes over as housekeeper.\n\nOr maybe \u2014 and it might amount to the same thing \u2014 the Kims\u2019 reality has turned into an unsettling allegory of modern life, and Ki-woo doesn\u2019t see metaphors in the way that a fish doesn\u2019t notice water. What started out as a clever scam has turned into a fable.", "description": "If you want to know why his biting \u201cParasite\u201d is the film of the year, look at the director\u2019s body of work, a deeply humane vision of rotting humanity.", "authors": ["A.O.
