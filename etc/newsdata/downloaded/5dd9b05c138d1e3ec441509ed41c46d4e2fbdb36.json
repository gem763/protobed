Should it get preference for playing time?", "language": "en", "text": "City officials and Maret leaders defended a no-bid deal that allows the elite K-12 school the right to use the field at Jelleff Recreation Center during prime after-school hours until 2029. In exchange, the school with a $34 million endowment has agreed to pay $950,000 for maintenance and some renovations to the field and adjacent recreation center.\n\nAD\n\nThe arrangement is an extension of a 2009 agreement with the city, in which Maret spent $2.4 million for new turf, a remodeled outdoor pool and outdoor lighting in exchange for use of the field during prime hours.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, the nation was still recovering from the 2008 recession and the city\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation welcomed a way to fund improvements to Jelleff.\n\nBut critics and some lawmakers question whether a city now flush with cash still needs Maret\u2019s help to maintain a public facility.And they note that the deal means that students at Hardy are blocked from using the field during prime hours, forcing their sports teams to travel across the city to compete. Under the arrangement, Hardy, which does not have a regulation field on its campus, is allowed to use Jelleff only on Wednesdays.\n\nAD\n\nKatrina Tracy testified about the challenges of playing soccer as a Hardy student without regular access to the field next door.\n\nShe said she frequently missed her last classes of the day to travel for games and practiced alongside the boy\u2019s soccer team at Hardy\u2019s outdoor space: a cramped, oval-shaped piece of land with no lines and no full-size goals. The arrangement with Maret meant she never played a single home game in her years at Hardy, she said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo one ever explained why public school students couldn\u2019t use the public field across the street from us,\u201d said Tracy, now a freshman at School Without Walls. \u201cTo allow a private school five days a week at the prime time is the epitome of private-school privilege.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOthers noted that children who attend after-school programs at Jelleff are also blocked from using the field.\n\nBut Kendrick Curry II, a Maret junior and a baseball player, said the opportunity to practice at Jelleff, which has one of the few regulation-size playing fields in Northwest, is part of what drew him to Maret.\n\n\u201cWithout funding from Maret, Jelleff would be nonexistent,\u201d said Curry, who lives in Ward 7. \u201cJelleff is also our home, and it is a significant part of Maret continuing to thrive as a school so Maret can continue to serve our community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCurry and Tracy were among the few students to testify at Monday\u2019s daytime hearing. The council chamber was at capacity with hundreds of mostly adult attendees. Maret alumni, employees, parents and students turned out to defend their school from what they described as smears.\n\nAD\n\nCouncil member Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8), who leads the committee overseeing the parks department, convened Monday\u2019s hearing to hear public testimony and to question city officials about their handling of the deal.\n\nSome who spoke urged the council members to pass legislation to prevent similar no-bid partnerships. They noted that the contours of the agreement \u2014 less than $1 million and fewer than 10 years \u2014 meant it could be approved by a city agency and didn\u2019t require review by the D.C. Council. Decisions about the use of public facilities should first be scrutinized by elected leaders, they said.\n\nAD\n\nDelano Hunter, the director of the parks department, was expected to testify that the best way to serve D.C. residents who can\u2019t use the Jelleff field during prime hours is to create a field at nearby Duke Ellington School of the Arts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are confident that our good faith effort to be fiscally responsible in continuing a longstanding relationship with an excellent partner was the best decision,\u201d Hunter\u2019s prepared remarks say.\n\nCouncil member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), whose son attended Maret and whosedistrict includes Jelleff, on Monday defended the city\u2019s relationship with the private school.\n\n\u201cWithout this investment, the field and pool would have sat vacant for many more years,\u201d Evans said.\n\nCouncil members Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) questioned whether the arrangement was in the best interest of the city.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaret\u2019s interests are not the District\u2019s interests,\u201d said Silverman. \u201cYes, in 2009 those interests coincided. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true now, [or] in 2020.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMaret supporters said they resented how the dispute had been framed by some as a wealthy school asserting its privilege.\n\nSusan Reilly, who said one of her children attended public school and another Maret, said she was \u201coutraged over this angry smear campaign\u201d against the private school. \u201cThis rich-kid-poor-kid scenario is an easy potshot,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nA Twitter account, @MaretGoAway, sharply argued against the deal, frequently posting with the hashtag #RichKidsWinAgain. A viral Deadspin article summed up the situation with the headline: \u201cThe Legendary Public Rec Center In A Private School\u2019s Pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey accused our children of being the quote, \u2018Children of the powerful\u2019 and denied quote, \u2018black and brown kids\u2019 access to the field,\u201d said Ian Cameron, who leads the school\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cCanceling the Jelleff agreement would do nothing to address the real culprit here . . . insufficient playable space in D.C.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers also decried some of the vitriol leveled at the school.\n\n\u201cMaret was not wrong here trying to meet a need that their school community had for more field space,\u201d Robert White said in his opening remarks. \u201cI do believe, however, that our agencies were wrong to enter into an agreement that stripped the community of access to their field that they need.\u201d\n\nOthers said they were grateful to Maret for helping renovate the field, but they objected to extending the deal.\n\n\u201cThe question now is about access, and how that access is being given and who has the access,\u201d said Abi Paulsen, a co-president of the parent-teacher organization at Hardy. \u201cThere\u2019s essentially another generation of kids that won\u2019t have access.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSupporters of the deal with Maret warned that if the District breaks the agreement, the city risks scaring away other organizations from partnering with the government.\n\nAD\n\nBut critics countered that the extension of the deal creates its own troubling precedent.\n\n\u201cPrime-time access for $950,000 when the District is seriously prosperous?\u201d said Mary Levy, an education budget analyst. \u201cThe District is short on public fields as it is, and yet on that rationale, every single public field in the District is in danger of being taken from the public to serve moneyed private entities.\u201d", "description": "The D.C.
