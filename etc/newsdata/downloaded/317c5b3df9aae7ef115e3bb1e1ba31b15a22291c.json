I couldn\u2019t stop. I ended up going to see a counsellor who told me that I was mourning Sinead.\n\n\u201cA month later I still feel like I\u2019m really mourning her. It feels like waves of sadness coming over me.\n\n\"One minute I\u2019ll be all right, then the next I\u2019m in tears. It might sound weird, but to me Sinead has always been real.\n\nKatie added: \u201cSometimes I hear her voice and I have mistakenly thought I have caught a glimpse of her face in a crowd of people.\n\n\u201cWhen I look in the mirror a piece of Sinead looks back at me.\u201d\n\nKatie tells how she felt she was coping well during the actual filming but first broke down just days after leaving the Street.\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cI was so confused about what was wrong with me,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason for me to be so upset. I hadn\u2019t been drinking, I wasn\u2019t hungover and I knew it wasn\u2019t hormonal.\n\n\u201cBut I got the role aged 19 and Sinead had become like a friend to me.\n\n\"Throughout my adult life. She\u2019s been inside of my head for seven years and my whole life was wrapped around her.\n\n\u201cI used to put on Sinead\u2019s crazy shoes, and I would become her. I have grown up with her and I\u2019m sad now she\u2019s gone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the type to cry normally. I\u2019m not heartless but my friends have joked in the past that I had a heart of stone because I don\u2019t cry about much.\n\n\u201cI put it down to growing up in a Northern household where you\u2019d get the mickey taken out of you if you cry over a sad film or whatever.\n\n\u201cBut I suddenly felt very vulnerable. It came as a shock and I thought, \u2018I\u2019d better do something about this\u2019.\u201d\n\nA friend gave her the name of a counsellor and she has since had three weekly sessions.\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cThe first time we just talked about why I was so upset, while the second meeting was about getting to the crux of the problem,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI told her I couldn\u2019t understand what was up.\n\nThe counsellor told me, \u2018Katie, you are grieving for Sinead\u2019.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realised what was happening at the time but it made sense when she said it.\n\n\"She said I\u2019d got so good at differentiating myself from Sinead that she had become like a friend to me.\n\n\u201cIn my third session, we talked about ways that I could improve the way I felt by looking after myself, going to the gym more and taking long walks.\n\n\"I told my friends and family how I wasn\u2019t feeling myself, although I think they knew because I kept crying for no reason.\n\n\u201cMy mum Ruth lives a few miles away in Manchester and I was so busy with interviews about leaving Coronation Street that I couldn\u2019t get to see her so she was worried. She kept phoning to check in on me.\u201d\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\nKatie\u2019s counsellor has suggested she write a farewell letter to Sinead or take a few days away to help her \u201cprocess\u201d the loss.\n\nBut she admits some of her upset could be connected to leaving her \u201cCoronation Street family\u201d after six years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all really close,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to miss everyone. It\u2019s such a life change.\u201d\n\nWhile she says she is starting to feel better, she reveals she is still hit by \u201cwaves of grief\u201d which leave her crying again.\n\nThe role has also had an effect on her physical health.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe says she piled on a stone eating junk food and takeaways because she became so emotionally entrenched in Sinead.\n\n\u201cThe emotion involved in Sinead dying meant I was just grabbing food and not really thinking about good nutrition,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI was so tired when I got home that I\u2019d order a takeaway. On set, there were a lot of chocolates, flap jacks and treats flying around.\u201d\n\nCoronation Street bosses offered Katie counselling while she was playing Sinead but she says it was only after leaving that she felt the toll of the demanding role.\n\n\u201cWhile I was playing Sinead, I was just so immersed I didn\u2019t have time to focus on anything else,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt was upsetting at times, of course, but I didn\u2019t think it was having any effect on me.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe says the most devastating scenes showed Sinead recording a final goodbye message to baby son Bertie.\n\n\u201cThe tears I shed then were real. I put myself into the storyline as much as I could and it just felt so real.\n\n\u201cI just imagined I really was Sinead and thought about how she would really feel. I did that a lot with the role and I think that\u2019s why it impacted me so much.\u201d\n\nShe also reveals that soap co-stars Rob Mallard and Lisa George, who plays her aunt Beth, were also tearful during the last days of filming.\n\n\u201cWe are really close friends and I think it was quite upsetting for them because it was not just Sinead\u2019s last days but I was leaving too,\u201d says Katie.\n\n\u201cThe last few weeks were weird because every time we went into Sinead\u2019s room there was an eerie atmosphere and everyone in the cast and crew would go quiet or tearful. It was like someone was actually dying.\u201d\n\nShe tells how when she left she took a few of Sinead\u2019s costumes home when she left the Street, saying: \u201cHer pyjamas are special to me. I feel close to her when I wear them.\u201d\n\nIt was Katie who suggested to Corrie producers that her character was killed off because a lot of shows cover cancer but very few take it to the death.\n\nShe says she has had little personal experience of cancer herself but hopes Sinead\u2019s plight will restore the \u201cJade Goody effect\u201d, which saw a huge surge in the number of young women going for smear tests after the diagnosis and death of the reality TV star.\n\nKatie\u2019s storyline has seen women take to social media calling for the cervical cancer screening age to be lowered below the age of 25.\n\nShe says: \u201cI\u2019ve had emails from young women thanking me because they were too scared to get a smear until they watched Sinead\u2019s battle. Some have had treatment for irregular cells and are thankful they went.\n\n\u201cNurses have also sent me messages saying they have seen an increase in smear tests. It makes me so proud.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMeanwhile, she is backing the Sunday Mirror\u2019s mental health campaign Time to Change, to end discrimination against those suffering.\n\n\u201cThis is my first experience of mental health issues and it\u2019s not been pleasant,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cMy advice to anyone having problems is to get help as soon as you can.\u201d\n\nNow Katie is looking forward to some light relief \u2013 she is to play Tinker Bell in Peter Pan at Northwich Memorial Court this Christmas.\n\n\u201cI love drama, but my first love was comedy,\u201d she says.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Katie McGlynn reveals how the harrowing on-screen death of her Coronation Street character Sinead Tinker left her grief stricken and in need of counselling", "authors": ["Grace Macaskill", "Image", "John Gladwin Sunday Mirror", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20730526.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JGP_MSM_261019Corrie_005JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
