The move, military officials said, is designed as a deterrent against an increasingly hostile Iran.\n\nTrump administration officials on Sunday issued their own warnings to Iran, stressing that the U.S. will not hesitate to defend itself while also saying they want to avoid military conflict and will continue pursuing a diplomatic track this week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nBut Iran seems to have little appetite for diplomacy and instead is ramping up its rhetoric.\n\nMaj. Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said over the weekend that any \u201climited\u201d military response by either Saudi Arabia or the U.S. will lead to widespread destruction.\n\n\u201cBe careful. A limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor,\u201d Gen. Salami said in a speech broadcast on Iranian state-controlled TV. \u201cWe are after punishment, and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\u201d\n\nThe White House, the State Department and the Pentagon have gone to great lengths over the past week to avoid further inflaming tensions with Iran. So far, the administration has steered clear of retaliatory strikes against Iran after an attack earlier this month in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil facility, a key cog in global energy markets.\n\nAmid lingering questions about how Saudi Arabia \u2014 which has purchased state-of-the-art defense equipment from the U.S. in recent years \u2014 was unable to detect and thwart the attack, American military officials said they will dispatch another contingent of troops to the region.\n\nThe exact number of military personnel headed to the Middle East is expected to be announced this week. At a hastily arranged press conference at the Pentagon on Friday evening, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the deployment will serve three distinct purposes.\n\n\u201cFirst, to send a clear message that the United States supports our partners in the region. Second, to ensure the free flow of resources necessary to support the global economy,\u201d Mr. Esper told reporters. \u201cAnd third, to demonstrate our commitment to upholding the international rules-based order that we have long called on Iran to obey.\n\n\u201cAs the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary,\u201d the Pentagon chief added.\n\nMr. Esper and other administration officials have blamed the Abqaiq assault on Iran, though they have not said definitively that the missiles and drones used in the attack were launched from inside Iran.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the presence of more U.S. troops will help security conditions in the region and dissuade Iran from launching further attacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll improve,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about volume and density.\u201d\n\nBut Iran continues to deny responsibility for the Abqaiq attack. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that he welcomes an investigation into the origins of the incident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that Iran did not play a role. I\u2019m confident that anyone who conducts an impartial investigation will reach that conclusion,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Zarif also said there will be no \u201climited war\u201d in the region and that any conflict will end with the destruction of Iran\u2019s enemies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident we can avoid a war. I\u2019m confident we will not start one,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident whoever starts one will not be the one who finishes it.\u201d\n\nThe administration dismissed Mr. Zarif\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone listens to the Iranian foreign minister,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cHe has lied for decades. \u2026 It\u2019s beneath the dignity of anyone in the world to listen to someone who repeatedly makes the claim that the Houthis launched this attack.\u201d\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the Abqaiq attack. The U.S., Saudi Arabia and other nations have dismissed that claim.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
