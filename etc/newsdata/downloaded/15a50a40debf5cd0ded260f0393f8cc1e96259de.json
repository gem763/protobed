It\u2019s being waged fiercely in Westminster Palace\u2019s House of Commons and also in the House of Lords \u2014 and in the newsrooms and green rooms of American journalism as well.\n\nYou could argue it\u2019s the subject, open or veiled, of almost all recent British and American opinion journalism. But what I find most interesting is that the same elites who proclaim themselves the guardians of accepted mores and norms of civility have been freely, and self-righteously, abandoning those very mores and norms without a hint of embarrassment.\n\nConsider what\u2019s been happening in Westminster. Some 21 MPs elected as Conservatives voted against Prime Minister Boris Johnson and effectively placed control of the agenda in the hands of the leftist anti-Semitic Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. That goes against the long-established norm of voting with your party.\n\nThey were able to do so only because the House Speaker, John Bercow, abandoned longstanding precedent to allow such a vote, making it clear he did so to undermine Johnson\u2019s policy on Brexit. That goes against the long-established norm that the British speaker (unlike the speaker here) is politically neutral and follows precedent, whatever the political effect.\n\nThe issue that divides Johnson and the large majority of Conservative MPs from the party rebels and the speaker (who was originally elected to Parliament as a Conservative himself) is, of course, Brexit.\n\nBritish voters in June 2016, more than three years ago, voted to leave rather than remain in the European Union. Turnout was huge; discussion was thorough, and dominated by the pro-\"Remain\" leaders of all parties and the pro-\"Remain\" BBC. Nonetheless, some 52% of British voters voted for leave \u2014 a larger number than have ever voted for any party in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nYet, Britain hasn\u2019t left yet, for reasons set out by Christopher Caldwell in the Claremont Review of Books. Johnson\u2019s feckless predecessor, Theresa May, made unilateral concessions to EU negotiators, guided by pro-remain career civil servants. The Commons rejected her agreements three times by nearly 2-to-1. She effectively abandoned the alternative that Britain would leave without a deal, reverting to WTO trade rules.\n\nJohnson has said he\u2019ll negotiate with the EU but, absent an agreement, will leave on the Oct. 31 date which Parliament voted and revised the parliamentary schedule to facilitate that.\n\nRemainers in Parliament and the press attacked his determination to carry out voters\u2019 solemn verdict as \u201cundemocratic.\u201d Some called for a \u201cunity\u201d government, as if a position rejected by voters could forge unity. They routinely dismissed \"Leave\" voters as ignorant, bigoted, or manipulated by campaign trickery. The two lead editorials in the pro-\"Remain\" Economist incongruously lament voters\u2019 cynicism and yet urge overturning voters\u2019 Brexit verdict.\n\nContempt for voters as ignorant and bigoted unites English-speaking elites on both sides of the Atlantic. Here it is apparent, or lightly disguised, in New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet\u2019s remarks at a newsroom meeting of reporters and editors last month.\n\nThe precipitating event seems to have been a Times headline reading \u201cTrump urges unity vs. racism.\u201d This accurate description of a presidential speech inspired Twitter rage from readers and Democratic politicians and was dropped for one with an anti-Trump hit, \u201cAssailing hate but not guns.\u201d So much for the norm of journalistic objectivity.\n\nBaquet also reflected on the Times\u2019 coverage of the Trump presidency. \u201cChapter One of the story of Donald Trump, not only for our newsroom but, frankly, for our readers was: Did Donald Trump have untoward relationships with the Russians, and was there obstruction of justice?\u201d But then, \u201cthe day Bob Mueller walked off that witness stand,\u201d he went on, \u201cour readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, \u2018Holy [expletive], Bob Mueller is not going to do it.\u201d\n\nOne of the hallmarks of a great journalist is an instinct for stories that are going to pan out; by his own account, Baquet and the Times lacked it utterly for two years. So, what\u2019s the paper\u2019s new number one story? \u201c[t]o write more deeply about the country, race and other divisions.\u201d Hence the Times\u2019 1619 Project. The news hook is the arrival of slaves in Virginia 400 years ago, with articles repeatedly asserting the centrality of racism in America ever since, in everything from the lack of universal healthcare to the routes of the freeways in Atlanta.\n\nIn other words, having failed to oust Trump on Russia, the Times will try to discredit the elected president, his policies, and his voters as racists.
