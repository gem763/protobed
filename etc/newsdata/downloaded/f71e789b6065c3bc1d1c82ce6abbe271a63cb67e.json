In the midst of rapid urbanisation and Westernisation, there still exists a significant amount of tribes and tribal communities in the country. These tribes, collectively known as Adivasis or \u201coriginal inhabitants,\u201d retain their centuries-long traditions and are often ignored by the Indian government and society. When Chotani realized this, he knew he had to find a way to preserve these tribes.\n\nEnter The Last Avatar, Chotani\u2019s photography project that launched in March 2018.\n\n\u201cI want this to act as an archive for future generations, researchers or anybody who might be interested in knowing these tribes,\u201d Chotani told VICE. \u201cTo our dismay, we realized how their cultures are slowly vanishing and being forgotten. This is too big a loss to be handled.\u201d\n\nChotani initially intended to capture the tribes through a photo book but he eventually expanded his vision into a digital project that now consists of a website and Instagram account. He and his co-founders Vishal Bali and Stanzin Chokphel, who are part of the production team, collaborate to produce the various components of the initiative. Writers Roohani Sawhney and Vrinda Vaid also work on the project by telling the stories of the indigenous people.\n\nA woman from the Raikas tribe.

So far, they have captured 15 communities across the country, covering the regions of Gujarat, Ladakh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh, and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nFor the most part, each tribe\u2019s openness in front of the camera depended on whether they\u2019ve been exposed to photography before. Chotani said he and his team were welcomed by most indigenous communities they visited but that some tribes were shy at first.\n\n\u201cIt is more to do with the kind of rapport you built with them,\u201d he explained. \u201cI personally believe in building a relationship and spending time in knowing them before asking them to be photographed. And mostly they have happily agreed.\u201d\n\nA woman from the Red Aryan tribe.

He views each of these elements as \u201cthe various gifts of culture\u201d that the tribes offer.\n\nEach tribe\u2019s geographic location plays a huge role in shaping their lifestyle, the photographer said.\n\nThere\u2019s the Konyaks of Nagaland, who live in a tightly-bound community led by traditional chiefs. There\u2019s the Red Aryans, or Drogpas, who reside in Ladakh and previously kept themselves isolated, forbidding marriage outside of their own community. Then there\u2019s the Aghori, a group of Hindu ascetics who perform post-mortem rituals and often depict Hindu gods such as Lord Shiva.\n\nA head hunter from the Konyak tribe.

They're visible in the flamboyant headgear worn by the Drogpas, the regal turbans donned by the Rajasthani tribes, and the tattoos adorning the faces of the Konyaks.\n\nIn a way, Chotani\u2019s photographs shed light on these communities that are often ignored by the larger Indian population.\n\nAccording to the last nationwide census in India conducted in 2011, indigenous people and scheduled tribes make up 8.6 percent of the country\u2019s population, which is around 104 million people. This is the largest indigenous population of any country in the world. Still, the rights of these tribes are often a contentious point in Indian politics and society. Amnesty International has long advocated for Adivasi rights, empowering the communities and making sure they are protected.\n\nGirls from the Ahir tribe.

Chotani observed in his travels that not all traditions are as well-preserved as others. For example, the tribes of Rajasthan still adhere to traditional modes of dressing but members of many other tribes nationwide now wear modern clothing.\n\nThis change is also noticeable in the technology, career aspirations, and food habits of some members of these indigenous groups. Chotani said that televisions and mobile phones were used by tribes \u201ceven in the remotest areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe younger generations [in these tribes] are highly influenced by the urban culture. This has led to the extinction of a major chunk of their traditional aspects,\u201d said Chotani. \u201cThey are leaving behind their traditional setup and fast assimilating to the urban lifestyle.\u201d\n\nFor Chotani, this is why The Last Avatar is important.\n\n\u201cThis project is our initiative towards saving what is being forgotten,\u201d the photographer said. \u201cDocumenting [each of the tribes] has been a soulful journey.\u201d\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "The Adivasis, or the indigenous people of India, make up 8.6 percent of the country\u2019s population and are largely forgotten by the media and society.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6cdb2bc1f18300088dc568/lede/1567415148103-Red-Aryans-Drokpas.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8419xh;0xw,0.1581xh&resize=1200:*"}
