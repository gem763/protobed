Berty said she was told his brain was swelling and at 6:30 a.m., on their scheduled wedding day, he was rushed into surgery to deal with an abscess.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t really thinking about the wedding at this point,\u201d she told SWNS. \u201cIt was more like, \u2018How is this happening? We are supposed to be starting our lives and he could die.' It was scary and I cried a lot.\u201d\n\n'UNIVERSAL' FLU VACCINE MAY BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO REALITY\n\nSinus infections afflict an estimated 31 million people in the United States each year, resulting in 16 million doctor visits, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Symptoms usually include headache, facial pain, runny nose and nasal congestion. In rare cases, if not treated, the infection can spread to the brain, which can be life-threatening. Patients with allergies, structural blockages in the nose or sinuses, or those with weakened immune systems may be at greater risk.\n\nDoctors removed the left side of Timothy\u2019s skull to relieve pressure and he was placed in a medically induced coma for two days. Meanwhile, the couple\u2019s parents told the guests to go to the firehouse and enjoy the food and cake that had already been set up.\n\nTimothy wound up spending 23 days in the hospital and was devastated to learn that the wedding hadn\u2019t taken place, SWNS reported. When he woke from the coma, he reportedly told his fiance, \"You, me, forever.\"\n\nBut rather than reschedule their big day, the couple got married at his bedside with the help of a friend who is an ordained minister.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe was discharged weeks later and in January underwent another surgery to have his skull restored. He\u2019s continuing his recovery and the couple hopes \u201cthat the worst is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur wedding was really just about us,\u201d Jessica Berty said of their impromptu nuptials. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered if there were 220 guests or no guests.\u201d", "description": "The couple's guests were told to go ahead with the party since the food and cake had already been set up.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/neurosurgery-nu-420084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
