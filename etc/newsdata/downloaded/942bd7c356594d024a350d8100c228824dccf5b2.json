Many of the passengers aboard the boat, which had taken divers out on Saturday and planned to return Tuesday, were asleep and below deck.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a worse situation,\u201d Brown said of the boat\u2019s remote location and fire\u2019s early morning start time.\n\nKyle Grillot / Reuters Flowers are fixed to the railing at Truth Aquatics as a search continues for those missing in a pre-dawn fire that sank a commercial diving boat off a Southern California island near Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to see if anybody could have survived this,\u201d he continued, noting that the search around the boat and nearby coastline was still underway.\n\nThe first four bodies recovered Monday morning won\u2019t be identified until the coroner\u2019s office performs a DNA test, Brown said, but confirmed that the first four victims were two adult men and two adult women. The four additional bodies discovered later on Monday will remain on the ocean floor until it\u2019s safe for rescue divers to retrieve them.\n\nNews of the disaster first broke early Monday morning when Ventura County fire officials tweeted that they were responding to a fire aboard a dive boat southwest of Oxnard. Coast Guard officials said then that they had rescued the five crew members on board and found the first four bodies.\n\nThe boat began to sink while firefighters responded to the fire, according to the Coast Guard.\n\nA representative for Truth Aquatics, which operates the boat, would not comment, saying he was awaiting word from officials.\n\nThis is a developing story.
