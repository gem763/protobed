George Laing of the Contra Costa Fire Department. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two tanks that are releasing chemicals that are still burning.\u201d\n\nThe Contra Costa Health Department posted on Twitter that there was a \u201chazardous materials emergency\u201d in the towns of Crockett, home to about 3,100 people, and Rodeo, population 8,700.
