Foley said: \u201cThey all have southern hemisphere coaches, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nWarren Gatland revels in Wales calm as Cheika whips up Australia storm | Paul Rees Read more\n\nThe Australia fly-half, the architect of the 2015 victories over England and Wales has been restored to the side for Sunday\u2019smatch against Wales. It will, after Fiji\u2019s defeat to Uruguay, very probably settle the group title. Wales and Ireland had the same coaches in 2015 when they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by South Africa and Argentina, respectively. Australia saw off England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 just \u2013 while the Springboks overpowered Scotland and New Zealand flattened France. It was put down as a triumph of ball handling over manhandling, brain-vanquishing brawn, but despite the nationalities of the three head coaches, the gap has closed not through imitation but the reinforcement of traditional virtues.\n\nThe meeting between Australia and Wales will be the first and only test of whether there has been a significant shift in the balance between the hemispheres, with New Zealand and South Africa in the same pool. England do have Argentina to contend with next Saturday, but the Pumas have barely won a Test since overwhelming Ireland, in the 2015 semi-final.\n\n\u201cA number of the squads have improved in terms of depth and consistency,\u201d said Foley. \u201cThey all have world-class players throughout their 31 and their domestic competitions are set at an extremely high level. It means they play a lot of good football all year round and that can only benefit them when it comes to preparing for a World Cup.\u201d\n\nIt is an explanation for the rejuvenation of England and Ireland, the two countries to supply European Champions Cup winners in the past four years. But Wales? The Scarlets did make the semi-finals last year and in 2017 became the last winners of the old Pro 12, but the success of the national side under Warren Gatland has largely been despite the record of the country\u2019s four regions rather than because of it.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to look too far back,\u201d said the Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who breaks Gethin Jenkins\u2019s record of 129 Welsh caps. \u201c\u2018Gats has said that we now perform when the big games come around. We know we have a big test in front of us and we will not shy away from it.\u201d\n\nFor all the three grand slams Wales have won in the Gatland era, and the manner they stole the 2013 Six Nations title from England in Cardiff, it will be their defining moment under Gatland, no more than five weeks before he hands over after 12 years in charge. They are expected to win, as Australia\u2019s head coach, Michael Cheika, acknowledged, even if almost in relief. Yet their record against the south\u2019s big three in the World Cup is poor, 10 straight defeats.\n\nWhile Australia have largely struggled since reaching the final four years ago, they tend to dig deep in a World Cup. They have reached three finals, more than anyone else, and one semi-final in the five tournaments in the professional era, their one failure coming when England burst their tyres at the Stade Velodrome in the 2007 quarter-final.\n\nThey were in no better shape four years ago than now. Cheika, less than a year into the job, turned to experience then and he has done so again. Wales ended a run of 13 consecutive defeats to Australia in Cardiff in November, but matches between them this decade have tended to be tight, often decided by a late score.\n\n\u201cWe made changes to the backline from the Fiji game because we want to produce different pictures,\u201d said Cheika. \u201cIt was not a response to what happened that day but something we thought about from the very start. Wales are a very well-drilled side, but our players know what their jobs are.\u201d\n\nCheika has loosened the reins this year in an attempt to made his side more difficult to read in an age of constant analysis. It did not work against Fiji who revel in chaos, but if there is a reason why it may be premature to anticipate an all-European final, it is that England, Wales and Ireland are not at their most comfortable dealing with the unexpected. Australia will be armed with the element of surprise and they have a turnover specialist in David Pocock. \u201cThere is no one style of play that guarantees you victory,\u201d said Cheika. \u201cWhen I coached Leinster, we played in a very different way to Munster but both teams were successful. I just like my teams to play footy.\n\n\u201cWhen we first came together at the start of the year and started talking about playing a different way, there were a lot of blank looks, especially from the playmakers because they are so used to pre-calling everything. A certain amount of unpredictability is good.\u201d\n\nWales do not see it that way, but they will need to deal with the unexpected.", "description": "Warren Gatland\u2019s side are favourites against Australia in Tokyo but recent history is not on their side", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65fbb752deb2d16157d1c2fd74017a205c98a841/0_119_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=212bb02254567e886bc66d9ab3c6a2e5", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
