Well, it\u2019s not really moving. It\u2019s just your brain being confused by what your eyes tell it.\n\nThe confused brain\n\nOur brain is like a blind supercomputer; it\u2019s very smart, but it can\u2019t see. It\u2019s just a really smart blob.\n\nTo figure out what it needs, our eyes tell our brain what the things around us look like. The problem is our eyes only know a handful of words to describe what they see.\n\nSometimes, our brain gets confused by what the eyes are trying to tell it.\n\nThis can mean the brain thinks things are moving when actually they\u2019re still. Or you might \u201csee\u201d shapes, shades or colours that aren\u2019t really there.\n\nA simple language\n\nOur eyes and brain speak to each other in a very simple language, like a child who doesn\u2019t know many words. Most of the time that\u2019s not a problem and our brain is able to understand what the eyes tell it.\n\nThe colour of an orange, the size of a chair, how far away the door is \u2013 your brain knows all these things because the eyes told it so in simple language.\n\nBut your brain also has to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d meaning it has to make some guesses based on the simple clues from the eyes. Mostly those guesses are right (for example, I can see the door looks about this big and the light falls on it that way, so my brain is taking these simple clues and guessing the door is about one metre away).\n\nA wrong guess\n\nSometimes, however, the brain guesses wrong.\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nFor example, it thinks our eyes told it something is moving but that\u2019s not what the eyes meant to say to the brain. (Our brains and eyes evolved to be quite sensitive about movement because in pre-historic times it was a big help if you could spot movement early and often. A slight rustle in the bushes could mean a predator was nearby and it was time to run away. Spotting movement early could save your life!)\n\nOptical illusions happen when our brain and eyes try to speak to each other in simple language but the interpretation gets a bit mixed-up.\n\nBut how and why?\n\nA lot of scientists have worked very hard for many years trying to understand how optical illusions work. But the truth is, in many cases, we still don\u2019t know for sure exactly how our brain and eyes work together to create these illusions.\n\nWe know that information that our eyes gather goes on a long, complicated journey as it travels to the brain. Some of the confusion happens early in that journey. Other optical illusions can only be explained by really complicated processes way down the line in that journey.\n\nIn general, the further down the line these \u201cconfusions\u201d occur, the less scientists tend to know about exactly how they happen.\n\nBut who knows? Maybe you will grow up to be part of the research team that cracks the code.\n\nCedric van den Berg, PhD student, The University of Queensland\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
