REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nThe interviews could yield more fodder for Democrats\u2019 impeachment drive over a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that Trump leveraged $400 million in aid to secure a promise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and assailed the probe.\n\nAmong those due to testify: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who was involved in efforts to get Ukraine to open the investigations, and Masha Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May after Trump supporters questioned her loyalty to the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House could formally tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as early as Monday that it will ignore lawmakers\u2019 demands for documents until the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives holds a vote to formally approve the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi says a vote is not needed, but Democrats say she would prevail if one were held, although very few Republicans would be expected to side with the Democratic majority. Congress returns to Washington on Oct. 15 after a two-week recess.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that she would have the votes,\u201d Democratic Representative Jim Himes said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday.\n\nThe impeachment investigation could lead to the approval by the House of formal charges against Trump.\n\nA trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, but few Republicans have broken ranks with Trump so far for asking Ukraine and China to launch investigations of Biden, a former vice president and leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nSECOND WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate an August complaint from an unnamed U.S. government official, which touched off the investigation.\n\nDiplomatic text messages released by Democrats last week show that U.S. officials were involved in the effort to secure a public commitment from Ukraine to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has alleged that Hunter Biden profited in his business dealings in both Ukraine and China from his father\u2019s position, and that Joe Biden, as vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to impede a probe of a company tied to his son.\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden.\n\nThose texts show Sondland seeking to downplay the concerns of another U.S. diplomat, William Taylor, that the United States was withholding $400 million in aid in order to secure Ukraine\u2019s cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland wrote. \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forths by text.\u201d\n\nSondland is expected to testify on Tuesday before the three House committees leading the impeachment probe. State Department counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl is also scheduled to testify that day.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State George Kent is scheduled to testify on Monday. Yovanovitch is due to appear on Friday.", "description": "A parade of U.S. diplomats will head to Capitol Hill for closed-door testimony this week as Democrats build their impeachment case against President Donald Trump, while the White House considers ways to slow down the process.", "authors": ["Andy Sullivan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437942731&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9607G", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
