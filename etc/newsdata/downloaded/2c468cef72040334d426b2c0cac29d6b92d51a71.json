In a terse response,\n\nPresident Macron criticised Greta's attack, saying: \u201cThere are lots of citizen\u2019s actions that are useful. Here, such very radical positions are liable to antagonise our societies.\u201d\n\nHe denied that the \u201cFrench or German government\u201d were blocking any green transition, saying they were \u201cstopping our coal activities, our fossil fuel production\u201d.\n\nMr Macron has styled himself internationally as a champion of environment issues abroad, but climate activists accuse him of failing to take enough concrete measures at home to fight climate change.\n\nHis government leapt to this defence too, with ecological transition minister Brune Poirson warning: \u201cYou cannot mobilise with despair, almost hatred.\u201d\n\nEducation minister Jean-Michel Blanquer added: \u201cFrance is today a locomotive in (fighting climate change) and Pr\u00e9sident Macron has done a lot on the issue.\n\nYou mustn\u2019t create a generation of depressed people over this issue,\u201d he warned.\n\nMr Macron has been seeking to gild his green credentials since placing a high-profile green second on his party\u2019s list for European elections, seeing young green vote as crucial to municipal elections next year and the presidentials in 2022.\n\nHe managed to annoyed Poland on Monday by calling on France's climate activists to \"go protest in Poland\u201d, which is heavily dependent on coal.\n\nHe said they were preventing the EU reaching its plan to eliminate coal by 2050. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek said he hoped that \"in this area as well as in other areas, (Mr Macron) will refrain from this kind of lecturing which, in his case, has become tiring\u201d.\n\nOnce again; this isn\u2019t about just 5 nations.\n\nThey were named since they are the highest emitters that have ratified the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, on which the complaint is built. China, USA, Saudi Arabia, Russia etc haven\u2019t.\n\nVisit https://t.co/VxeelgLkDi for more. https://t.co/TKQjJ3KjsR\n\n\n\n\u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 24, 2019\n\nGreta's UN speech saw her come in for mockery from Donald Trump.\n\n\"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\" the climate-skeptic American president tweeted afterwards.\n\nThat drew a furious online response from 16,000 users, with many slamming Mr Trump for attacking a young girl who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism.\n\nVeteran conservationist David Attenborough has, meanwhile, taken aim at Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for not giving a \"damn\" about coal emissions and his lack of action on climate change.\n\n\"Australia, it seemed to me, were saying all the right things - previous governments were,\" he told national broadcaster ABC. \"And you are keepers of an extraordinary section of the surface of this planet, including the Barrier Reef,\" he said \"what you say, what you do, really, really matters.\" Ends", "description": "Emmanuel Macron and his government on Tuesday\u00a0warned teenage climate activist\u00a0Greta\u00a0Thunberg that her \u201cradical\u201d stance risked \u201cdepressing a generation\" after she singled out France at the UN.
