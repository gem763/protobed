Here's my best piece of advice.", "language": "en", "text": "I work 40 hours a week, enjoy my weekends, and take plenty of vacations. And I\u2019ve never even earned a six-figure salary. Which is why, $US300,000 later, I\u2019ve got one huge piece of advice about money that you need to hear:\n\nYour money can work harder than you can. A lot harder.\n\nHow a few digits on a computer screen worked harder than a professional financial analyst\n\nAs a financial analyst, my take home pay is about $US5000 a month. Add back my retirement contributions, and my job as a financial analyst builds my wealth by somewhere around $US6000 a month.\n\nNot bad, and I definitely feel fortunate to have a decent-paying job. That said, my job is a bit of a slacker compared with my investments \u2026\n\nBetween January and February 2019 alone, my net worth grew by $US13,584. Of that $US13,500 of growth, $US2000 could be attributed to my pay cheque. The remaining $US11,500? That\u2019s my money working for me. And working hard.\n\nLooking back on the rest of the net worth log that I keep on my blog (how\u2019s that for a rhyme!?) my portfolio\u2019s returns outgrew my salary in six of the past 12 months:\n\nCourtesy of The Money Wizard\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realise this is a bit of a weird comparison. Investment gains can be volatile, and what goes up can and often does come down. And yet, on average, my investments have grown at a rate around 10 per cent a year for the past several years.\n\nExactly how hard does my $US312,000 portfolio work?\n\nWell, let\u2019s think of it this way. Through diligent saving and living frugally, I\u2019ve built my net worth towards a total value of roughly $US315,000. Assuming nothing else, even just 6 per cent returns on that $US315,000 equals $US15,750 a year.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that even if I personally start slacking in bringing home the cheese, my portfolio is still working away to bring in a $US15,750 salary.\n\nOn one hand, that amount sounds impressive. On the other hand, $US15,750 a year sounds like less than minimum wage. So let\u2019s put it into perspective.\n\nLast year, I saved $US36,253 from my salary as a financial analyst. If my portfolio also earns an additional $US15,750, that\u2019s an amount of money that would otherwise take me at least five months to save.\n\nThink about that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could slave away at a desk job, day in and day out for five months straight. Or, I could just have a $US315,000 portfolio, which by itself, automatically spits off five months\u2019 worth of my usual savings. Every year. For doing nothing.\n\nHinting at a future of financial freedom\n\nAs cool as it sounds to claim an army of money employees who are essentially working half a year for you, for free, I think we can do better. More specifically, what happens if I keep growing that portfolio? What happens if my portfolio isn\u2019t $US315,000, but instead $US500,000, or even $US1.5 million? Imagine a $US1.5 million portfolio. Sounds nice, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nYet I believe from using the frugal techniques I\u2019ve honed over the past few years (the same ones that now have me saving over 50 per cent of my salary) this is entirely achievable through consistent contributions and compound interest.\n\nIn this case, a $US1.5 million portfolio works so hard that assuming 5 per cent returns, it\u2019s earning $US75,000 every single year. At this point, all bets are off. At this point, your portfolio really is working harder than you are, and it makes no logical sense to continue working.\n\nThis is true financial freedom.\n\nTying this back to reality\n\nMy biggest pet peeve with most financial advice is just how unrelatable it seems. I mean, it\u2019s really freakin\u2019 hard to imagine a $US1.5 million portfolio, especially if you\u2019re struggling to save your first $US100,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd one of the biggest struggles in saving that first pile? It usually feels like you\u2019re not making any progress. Here\u2019s what I suggest.\n\nCalculate how much money you\u2019re saving. Then, calculate how much money your current portfolio is earning, by itself. Or even a portfolio that\u2019s completely attainable in the future, given some minor tweaks.\n\nSay you earn $US50,000 a year, and you\u2019re saving 10 per cent of your take home pay. (About $US4000 a year.)\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you make a few minor tweaks to your lifestyle. Maybe you start bringing your lunch to work instead of spending $US8 a day on yet another burrito. Over the course of a year, that $US8 a day adds up to $US2080. A 50 per cent increase in your savings rate.\n\nAn $US8 tweak here and there, and it\u2019s entirely possible to build up a $US50,000 portfolio in just a few years. At even just 5 per cent a year, your newfound portfolio is earning $US2500 a year, or a whopping 63 per cent of how much you were saving when you started this journey. Your portfolio is now building up 7.5 months of your old savings each year, compared with when you started.\n\nThis is why your money can work so much harder than you can.\n\nSo, is saving $US8 a day actually worth it? Despite how we may feel in the moment, the answer is a resounding, abso-freakin\u2019-lutely. Every dollar you save makes you exponentially richer. And over time, each dollar works harder and harder than the last.\n\nI get it. It\u2019s hard to imagine yourself building up an investment portfolio from zero to a million dollars. But that outlook is a mindset trap, because it\u2019s not just you building up that portfolio. It\u2019s you and every single dollar you\u2019ve ever saved. Together, you\u2019re all working towards making this dream of financial freedom a reality.\n\nGood luck.\n\nSean, who goes by the name \u201cThe Money Wizard\u201d, is a 28-year-old blogger and financial analyst.
