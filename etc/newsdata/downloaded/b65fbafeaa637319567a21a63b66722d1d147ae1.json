REUTERS/Tim Aeppel/File Photo\n\nThe survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday came on the heels of data last week showing a moderation in consumer spending in August. The economy\u2019s fading fortunes have been blamed on the White House\u2019s 15-month trade war with China, which has sapped business confidence and undermined manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThis is serious,\u201d said Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. \u201cThere is no end in sight to this slowdown, the recession risk is real.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates again last month after lowering borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008 to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said trade policy tensions, which \u201chave waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports.\u201d Powell said U.S. central bank contacts had told policymakers that trade policy uncertainty \u201chas discouraged them from investing in their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe ISM said its index of national factory activity dropped 1.3 points to a reading of 47.8 last month, the lowest level since June 2009, when the recession was ending. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 11% of the U.S. economy. September\u2019s reading marked the second straight month that the index broke below the 50 threshold.\n\nThe index has now declined for a sixth consecutive month and is in stark contrast with a rebound in the so-called hard data like industrial production, which showed output at factories rising in August.\n\nStill, the ISM index needs to drop below the 42.9 level to signal a recession in the broader economy.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war also coincides with a fading boost from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package. The ISM said comments from manufacturers \u201creflect a continuing decrease in business confidence,\u201d and also noted that \u201cglobal trade remains the most significant issue.\u201d\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index rising to 50.1 in September.\n\nThe ISM\u2019s forward-looking new orders sub-index edged up to a reading of 47.3 last month from 47.2, which was the lowest level since June 2012. A measure of export orders plunged 2.3 points to a reading of 41.0 in September. The survey\u2019s factory employment index dropped to 46.3 last month from 47.4 in August.\n\nThe dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the data. U.S. Treasury prices rose. U.S. stocks were trading lower.\n\nCONSTRUCTION SPENDING TEPID\n\nSlowing economic growth was also underscored by a separate report from the Commerce Department showing construction spending edged up 0.1% in August. Data for July was revised down to show construction outlays unchanged instead of nudging up 0.1% as previously reported.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending increasing 0.4% in August. Construction spending fell 1.9% on a year-on-year basis in August.\n\nSpending on private residential projects jumped 0.9%, the biggest gain since November 2018, after rising 0.6% in July. Housing starts and building permits surged to a more than 12-year high in August, government data showed last month, lifted by declining mortgage rates.\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped about 130 basis points from last year\u2019s highs to an average of 3.64%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.\n\nSpending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, dropped 1.0% in August to the lowest level since January 2018. Investment in private nonresidential structures decreased 1.6% in July.\n\nOutlays on private nonresidential structures have been weighed down by a manufacturing downturn due to trade tensions and cheaper energy products. Investment in nonresidential construction fell at its steepest pace in more than three years in the second quarter. That contributed to business investment declining for the first time in more than three years.\n\nSpending on private construction projects was unchanged in August after declining for four straight months.\n\nInvestment in public construction projects rose 0.4% after increasing 1.4% in July. Spending on state and local government construction projects gained 0.6%. That followed a 1.7% surge in July. Outlays on federal government construction projects dropped 2.2% in August after falling 2.5% in the prior month.", "description": "U.S. manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low in September as lingering trade tensions weighed on exports, further heightening financial market concerns of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435929388&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9031D", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
