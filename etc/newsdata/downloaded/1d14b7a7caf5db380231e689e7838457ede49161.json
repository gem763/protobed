Investments in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and consumer hardware ventures such as FitBit weighed on Google\u2019s profits last quarter, while clicks on ads rose by half less than penciled in by analysts. Meanwhile, the company lost a $10 billion dollar cloud contract with the US government to Microsoft. Hence, Alphabet shares could feel the pinch of bad news later today.\n\n\n\nNasdaq futures dipped on Google bitterness but rebounded as fast as they fell to record highs. Facebook and Apple are due to announce their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAlso, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is broadly expected to lower the interest rates by another 25 basis points. The expectation of a third rate cut in the US is reflected in asset prices up to 90%.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the good-looking third-quarter earnings point at an increased possibility of a hawkish rate cut, meaning that the Fed will likely serve the 25-basis-point cut with an accompanying hawkish statement at this week\u2019s banquet.\n\n\n\nThis is what the US sovereign markets have been pricing in, along with Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that the US is \u2018ahead of schedule\u2019 to sign a partial agreement with China at next month\u2019s APEC summit. The 10-year yield stands at a six-week high.\n\n\n\nGold returned to it is preferred $1490 an ounce shelter as risk averse-capital moved towards better-yielding, low-risk US treasuries.\n\n\n\nThe pound swung higher as the EU extended the Brexit deadline by three months to January 31, then gave back gains as Boris Johnson was refused an early election for the third time.\n\n\n\nBut Johnson is determined to hold a snap election before Christmas, come hell or high water. Hence, he will try to convince Parliament again on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHaving exploited most upside potential ahead of the Brexit agreement, the cable will likely remain skewed to the downside. Clearing the 1.28 support should send the pound towards the 1.27 against the US dollar, the critical 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, which should distinguish between the consolidation of recent gains and a mid-term bearish reversal.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE 100 remains bid below the 7300p mark.\n\n\n\nBP\u2019s third-quarter earnings should give a fresh direction to British energy stocks today. BP\u2019s earnings per share are expected to have fallen to 0.091 versus 0.1380 printed a quarter earlier on subdued oil prices amid global trade tensions and waning demand. The US oil stocks have surprised on the upside, as a reference. Hence, better-than-expected earnings on the BP front could give support to the 7% recovery since last week.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE is set for a flat open on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nFTSE to open 3 points higher at 7334\n\n\n\nDAX to open 10 points higher at 12952\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
