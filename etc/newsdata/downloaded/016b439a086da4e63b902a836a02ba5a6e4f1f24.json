When will the BBC learn that? | Micha Frazer-Carroll", "language": "en", "text": "Journalism 101 tells us that if someone says it\u2019s drizzling outside, and another that it\u2019s dry, the job of the journalist is not to quote both but to find out which is true. But this week, the BBC upheld a complaint against the breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for stating a truth as obvious as \u201cwater is wet\u201d. Munchetty was found to have breached the BBC\u2019s impartiality policy for her unscripted response to President Trump\u2019s tweets telling four congresswomen of colour to go back home. \u201cEvery time I have been told as a woman of colour to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.\u201d She said she felt \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d about it.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s misguided response suggests that reacting to racism is worse than racism itself. All I saw was another woman of colour calling out racist remarks for what they were, and describing her own experiences. The clear message sent by this ruling is that whether or not something is racist is purely subjective.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the BBC has framed racism as a conversation with two legitimate sides. It\u2019s not even the first time this month \u2013 last Friday, a complaint was upheld against the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis for being too \u201cpersistent and personal\u201d in confronting Rod Liddle on his back catalogue of blatantly racist columns. Maitlis didn\u2019t do anything more than quote Liddle\u2019s writing back to him \u2013 including one clipping that joked about Islamophobia and bombings, and another that implied the MP Kate Osamor was only in her job because of her race. This fits into a broader climate where short, fraught, \u201cfor and against\u201d interviews are equated with fair coverage on a given topic, which often just looks like asking a person of colour to debate a racist. I\u2019m bored of seeing all-white panels stacked against one person of colour to discuss whether blackface is \u201cactually offensive\u201d.\n\nAny approach to impartiality needs to clearly acknowledge that racism \u2013 particularly of the blatant \u201cgo home\u201d variety \u2013 is a violent and illegitimate standpoint. A head of state telling people of colour to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d is intrinsically intertwined with growing racist and anti-immigrant sentiment. A news presenter shouldn\u2019t be punished for observing this fact, and bringing her lived experience to the conversation. This is especially important considering standards don\u2019t always appear to be applied evenly \u2013 the white male BBC journalist Nick Bryant directly referred to the tweets as racist but didn\u2019t face the same consequences, perhaps because viewers didn\u2019t complain about what he said. This puts people of colour, who I suspect are more likely to face viewer complaints, at a double disadvantage.\n\nThe way Munchetty incorporated her personal experience of racism into the discussion also serves as a reminder that \u201cinclusion\u201d in a media context requires effective structural reform. This incident is a perfect illustration of why diversity isn\u2019t enough. While the BBC has improved the number of people of colour on screen, across the industry we are all too often used as visual signifiers of progress without organisations being fully prepared for what that means. We may bring different perspectives, and occasionally (gasp) will even speak about the racism we face. But if anything, this should be encouraged. A \u201cdiversity\u201d that is only concerned with having black and brown faces in the room fundamentally misunderstands representation as about good optics rather than platforming marginalised voices in the media. Bringing people of colour into newsrooms is purely tokenistic if the industry asks women like Munchetty to leave their perspectives at the door.\n\nBBC staff complain over Munchetty reprimand for Trump remark Read more\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t underestimate how pivotal moments like this can be in establishing attitudes to race within an organisation \u2013 and in the case of the BBC across the British media more broadly. In response to the broadcaster\u2019s decision, the BBC correspondent Sangita Myska wrote on Twitter: \u201cMany of us are worried about showing our concern in case we are reprimanded.\u201d This feels eerily reminiscent of the way that many staff said they felt after an episode of Question Time debated whether it was \u201cmoral\u201d for children to learn about LGBT relationships, with the BBC even later reprimanding its staff for publicly criticising the decision.\n\nThe BBC should revoke its decision and issue an apology to Munchetty, and it should reassess its self-described \u201cinclusive\u201d policy on impartiality. It should also bring people of colour into its executive complaints unit to weigh in on how policies are implemented, which internal BBC documents suggest might only have two women on its panel of seven.\n\nIn the current political climate, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment are rife, and the line between fact and opinion feels like it\u2019s becoming increasingly contested in the media. But racism is racism, and when people of colour are silenced, it sets a worrying precedent as to which experiences are seen as objective, and what is left up for debate.\n\n\u2022 Micha Frazer-Carroll is opinions editor at gal-dem.com", "description": "Naga Munchetty was right to criticise Trump\u2019s racist tweets, says gal-dem.com\u2019s opinions editor, Micha Frazer-Carroll", "authors": ["Micha Frazer-Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66fe45dd8fbb8f1c0ab98ed6f1897b1b4ba0bdf5/0_82_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=530b176de519f5c521a7b4c22ab0a1bc", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
