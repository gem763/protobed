I have had a tenant in it for the last couple of years and this helps to supplement my low income.\n\nThe local authority has now decided to upgrade my block, there are four flats in the block and as I am the home owner it has been assessed that my share will be \u00a314,000.\n\nI stopped working three years ago aged 60 due to ill health. I now have a part-time minimum wage job which I enjoy, have started to get back on an even keel and had started to reduce my medication but this has set me back.\n\nA man is being forced to have renovations on a flat he owns by the local council, which owns the block (stock image)\n\nI have contacted my local authority as some of the work does not appear necessary, as my home is in good repair. I thought they could carry out the work on the other council-owned properties and leave mine but apparently not. The sum appears excessive as the flat is only valued at approximately \u00a360,000.\n\nMy only option appears to be to make my tenant homeless and sell the property to pay the bill. I don\u2019t believe any responsible lender would offer me a loan of \u00a314,000 due to my age and financial position, however, wondered if you could help.\n\nThere are other elderly home owners in the street in the same position and the local authority doesn\u2019t care about what it is doing to us. I am at my wits end and don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIt is Falkirk Council who originally built the property and it was my home with my parents from 1972. I purchased it in around 1997 to allow my parents to live rent-free.\n\nIt is a four-in-a-block with a central stairway and my property is top left. The other people in the block are council tenants so will face no charges. The council are carrying out renovation work in various locations around the local area and have now descended on my village.\n\nI visit the property occasionally and can see no visible defects in the roof above my property or in the render. JP, Falkirk\n\nGrace Gausden, of This is Money, replies: You were contacted by Falkirk Council a couple of months ago to say that the local authority had decided to upgrade the housing block where you own a flat and understandably are worried about how on earth you will find the money for such a large bill at short notice.\n\nThe council told you that they intend to replace the roof and renew the render on the building and you will have to pay \u00a314.127.44 towards the work.\n\nYou say that do not think this work needs doing and more importantly you can't afford the money they are asking for, which represents almost 25 per cent of the value of the flat that was originally your family home from the early 1970s and you helped to buy for your parents to live in 22 years ago.\n\nI spoke to Falkirk Council to try to find out more and also looked into the background of your case.\n\nOfficial documents from April of this year say about the property: 'There is evidence of weathering throughout all elevations. There is significant loss of surface aggregate to all elevations.'\n\nThe council says that it gave those affected the opportunity to appeal the decision, which you say that you did, although the council have claimed otherwise, despite your insistence that you even went into the Falkirk Council building to do so.\n\nA This is Money reader was shocked to find out he had to pay the council thousands of pounds\n\nOf the four flats in the building block, three are council flats and a majority vote of three was needed to go ahead with the renovations, which has since been granted and is 'legally binding', suggesting you were the only one who opposed the decision.\n\nYou also explained that you went to the local Sheriff Court to complain but got nowhere.\n\nThe other people living in the block who are council tenants will not have to pay towards the changes as Housing Services pay for upgrades to council-owned properties.\n\nA spokesperson for Falkirk Council said: 'We carry out consultation with owners of properties in a mixed tenure block which allows them to put forward their views on if the work should be carried out.\n\n'Owners are provided with details of the proposed work and are given an opportunity to obtain their own quotes. If the majority say they want the work to go ahead then that is legally binding (there is an appeals process available).\n\n'We have not received any appeal or any alternative quotations for the work in this case. No work will take place until the appeal period has ended. We can discuss payment options with owners directly if requested.'\n\nOnce the work has been completed, you will receive a final bill and the council has said that a payment plan can be set up so you can spread out the costs over three to twelve months.\n\nHowever, you say that doing this would leave you in financial hardship, as even over a year it would require you to find \u00a31,167 a month and you are on a low income.\n\nFalkirk council said the roof needed replacing on the home of the This is Money reader\n\nThe renovation is being conducted under Schedule one of the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004 which sets out the procedure for making scheme decisions affecting scheme property, which is defined as 'parts of the tenement which are owned in common or maintained communally and which are so important to the structure of the tenement that they should be treated in a special way'.\n\nUnder this section, it claims that scheme property includes external walls of the tenement building and that carrying out maintenance to scheme property is a basic scheme decision under the schedule.\n\nIt also says that scheme decisions are made by majority vote of all the votes allocated - where one owner owns the majority of properties in a particular block then that owner also carries the majority vote.\n\nFalkirk Council says the title deeds for your freehold property allow the majority owners to make decisions and that you have been advised on numerous occasions to seek legal advice.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that there is little that you can do to challenge these charges. The council says that the work needs to be done and has calculated the cost - you could ask for a breakdown but it would be difficult for you to ascertain whether it is fair value.\n\nIt says that you could get your own quotes for doing this and present them, but again this is not the easiest thing for an individual flat owner on a low income to do, or assess the quality of contractors and their estimates.\n\nYou should make sure that you have followed all the official objection and appeals processes and investigate whether there is any way to continue to pursue this.\n\nIt would also be worth your while trying to speak to someone at the council who has the ability to discuss payment options. You could appeal to the council to let you spread the cost over a considerably longer period in order to make paying the bill more manageable.\n\nUnfortunately, even selling up will be difficult with these charges hanging over your flat and any new owner.", "description": "Falkirk Council has  decided to upgrade my block, there are four flats in the block and as I am the home owner it has been assessed that my share will be \u00a314,000.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
