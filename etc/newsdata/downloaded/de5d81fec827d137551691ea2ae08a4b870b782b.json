Backed by Miley Cyrus and number of other celebrity investors, the cafe is the first farm-to-table restaurant that brings cannabis and cuisine under one roof.\n\nLos Angeles-based cannabis company Lowell Herb Co. is behind the restaurant, which is one of over 10,000 licensed cannabis operators in California, according to the state's cannabis portal.\n\n\u201cWe always wanted to be an institution, as far as West Hollywood is concerned,\u201d Kevin Brady, Lowell Cafe\u2019s director, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \"We wanted to be a great restaurant that you could go to and, instead of having alcohol, replacing [it] with the social aspects of cannabis.\u201d\n\nLowell Cafe brands itself as part of a \u201cpost-cannabis prohibition\u201d atmosphere, a place where customers can enjoy the experience of pot consumption.\n\nExperienced smokers and novices are all welcome. Lowell has \u201cflower hosts\u201d that are similar to a restaurant\u2019s wine sommelier, who can offer suggestions and explain any of the product strains, flavors and their level of potency.\n\nLowell Cafe interior More\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s menu is organically inspired, and includes different forms of cannabis consumption. While cafe-goers can explore smoking, joints, pipes, bongs, and edibles, cannabis infused foods are not yet available because of California food restrictions.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the West Hollywood regulations versus the state regulations aren\u2019t necessarily at the same level, so we wanted to make sure [Lowell Cafe] abided by that,\u201d said Brady.\n\n\u201cIt has been a unique opportunity for sure,\u201d said Brady. \u201cWe\u2019ve really put a lot of effort into working with the local municipality to make all of this come to fruition.\u201d\n\nLowell Cafe menu items More\n\nWhile it became legal for licensed businesses to sell and distribute cannabis in the state back in 2018, not everyone in the West Hollywood neighborhood is on board with Lowell Cafe\u2019s grand opening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the first of its kind, something new, something different, and a lot of people are a bit hesitant to see what that\u2019s going to do\u201d to the community, Brady explained.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to demonstrate every single day is that we can, not only be a great business, and a great place that employs a lot of our local community, but also being a great neighbor to the community,\u201d he added.\n\nAmid widespread concerns about the safety of vaping, Brady touted Lowell\u2019s products as being of \u201cthe highest quality\u201d \u2014 and the proprietors stood behind them.\n\n\u201cKnowing that we have great partners there, we feel really confident as far as what we\u2019re offering here is always going to be safe for the consumer, and at the same time using our flower hosts that are going to be able to walk our guests through any sort of concerns that they have, and their cannabis experience from start to finish,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Smith is a Segment Producer/Booker at Yahoo Finance.
