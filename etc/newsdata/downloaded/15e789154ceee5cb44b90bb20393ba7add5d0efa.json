A failure to do so, the committee chairs warned, could lead to charges of contempt of Congress.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding this attempted obstruction, the duly authorized subpoena remains in full force and Dr. Kupperman remains legally obligated to appear for the deposition on Monday,\u201d the letter by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff: Barr 'weaponizing' DOJ 'to go after the president's enemies' Top Trump administration officials hail al-Baghdadi raid but stress need for resolve in fighting ISIS Schiff: 'Bolton is a very important witness' MORE (D-Calif.), acting Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney Carolyn Bosher MaloneyHouse leaders threaten contempt if former White House official defies subpoena House passes bill aimed at reducing rape kit backlog Speier to run for Oversight gavel MORE (D-N.Y.), and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelHouse leaders threaten contempt if former White House official defies subpoena Schiff says committees are making 'rapid progress' in impeachment probe Top Democrat: Court ruling 'wipes out' GOP claim of 'fake' impeachment MORE (D-N.Y.) said.\n\n\u201cThe deposition will begin on time and, should your client defy the subpoena, his absence will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding.\"\n\nCooper, in his letter to Noble, said \"it is not Dr. Kupperman who contests\" the Democrats' legal claim.\n\n\"It is President Trump, and every President before him for at least the last half century, who have asserted testimonial for their closest confidential advisors,\" Cooper wrote.\n\nKupperman was reportedly on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment investigation into allegations that Trump solicited foreign leaders to help his reelection in 2020.\n\nSchiff said Sunday that Bolton is also a \u201cvery important\u201d witness and House Democrats want him to testify.
