Sportsmail looks back at the most dramatic meetings between the teams in the Premier League era.\n\nEric Cantona's goal at St James' Park in 1996 proved significant in the Premier League title race\n\nMar 4, 1996 - Newcastle 0-1 Manchester United\n\nFor a couple of years in the mid-1990s this was arguably the biggest fixture in the Premier League. The Toon had topped the table by as much as 12 points but for all their swashbuckling attacking football they wilted as the finish line drew closer.\n\nUnited in relentless form arrived at St James' Park and through an Eric Cantona strike secured a vital win to close within one point of Kevin Keegan's side.\n\nNewcastle never recovered from the loss and shortly after Keegan's famous 'I would love it if we beat them' rant, the Red Devils would pip them to the title on the final day of the season.\n\nOct 20 1996 - Newcastle 5-0 Manchester United\n\nKeegan's side had a point to prove seven months on from the previous loss on home soil as well as a chastening 4-0 defeat in the Charity Shield at Wembley.\n\nBut with world record signing Alan Shearer now in the side, Keegan's team finally looked like they could take on the Sir Alex Ferguson juggernaut (if only briefly).\n\nShearer was sparkling alongside Les Ferdinand in attack and with an in-form David Ginola they left United stunned as they were torn apart. The trio were on target following Darren Peacock's opening goal and before Philippe Albert's audacious lob near the end that perfectly underlined one of the greatest Premier League performances.\n\nSadly for Newcastle, it failed to spark a credible title tilt and Keegan left the club before the season was out bringing down the curtain on the 'Entertainers' era.\n\nAlan Shearer and Les Ferdinand celebrate during the 5-0 thumping of Manchester United\n\nMay 22 1999 - Manchester United 2-0 Newcastle\n\nThree years after their title battles the then narrow gap between the teams had grown into a chasm.\n\nNonetheless, Newcastle had a chance to gain a measure of revenge at Wembley as they looked to win their first domestic cup since 1955 and stop United from gaining the second trophy on their way to a historic treble.\n\nYet this result was never in doubt as goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes saw Ferguson's side claim the FA Cup and condemn the Toon to a final defeat for the second year running.\n\nWembley goalscorers Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes celebrate FA Cup success in 1999\n\nSep 15 2001 - Newcastle 4-3 Manchester United\n\nNewcastle were starting to march up the table again and for the first time in five years were getting under the skin of United under the management of Sir Bobby Robson.\n\nJust after half-time they were 3-1 up in this clash, with goals from Laurent Robert, Rob Lee and Nikos Dabizas overseeing Ruud van Nistelrooy's equaliser.\n\nRyan Giggs and Juan Veron soon levelled but a late Wes Brown own goal had St James' Park rocking.\n\nMore drama was to come though. Roy Keane and Shearer clashed in the final moments, leading to the irate Irishman throwing a punch at the Toon striker and being sent off. Before he threw a few more he had to be restrained by team-mates.\n\nRoy Keane was sent off after throwing a punch at Shearer late on in his side's 2001 defeat\n\nApr 12 2003 - Newcastle 2-6 Manchester United\n\nThe teams shared 16 goals between them in the 2002-03 season - unfortunately for Newcastle, the Red Devils grabbed 11 of them.\n\nAt St James' Park Jermaine Jenas opened the scoring for the Toon and Shola Ameobi finished it but they were ripped apart by United in between that.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's equaliser, a double from Scholes and a Ryan Giggs strike ensured Sir Alex Ferguson's side were 4-1 up at the break. By the time the hour mark had passed Scholes had already completed his hat-trick and Ruud van Nistelrooy had netted the sixth with a penalty kick.\n\nScholes scored a hat-trick as Manchester United hammered Newcastle 6-2 in 2003\n\nApr 24 2005 - Manchester United 2-1 Newcastle\n\nA week after defeating Newcastle in the FA Cup semi-finals, United piled more misery on the Toon at Old Trafford.\n\nDarren Ambrose had given Newcastle the lead but second half strikes from Wayne Rooney and Wes Brown secured a comeback win for the hosts.\n\nBut it is Rooney's stunning volley which will most fondly be remembered. After getting into an argument with the referee during play, he took his anger out on the ball just seconds later with an incredible thunderous 25-yard volley that flew past a totally helpless Shay Given. He still looked an angry man while he was celebrating.\n\nWayne Rooney is congratulated by team-mates Rio Ferdinand and Cristiano Ronaldo after his stunning volley gave Manchester United an equaliser against Newcastle in 2005\n\nJan 12 2008 - Manchester United 6-0 Newcastle\n\nIt's incredible to think that at half-time in this game, managerless Newcastle were well on their way to frustrating United into a goalless draw at Old Trafford.\n\nBut as Ferguson's side chased a win that would send them to the top of the table, they eventually found a way through and with a Ronaldo brace and a Carlos Tevez strike were 3-0 up with five minutes to play.\n\nUnited were not done though. A late flurry of goals from Rio Ferdinand, Tevez and Ronaldo gave them the joy of six and the Portuguese star his only hat-trick in English football.\n\nRonaldo's only hat-trick in English football came in the 6-0 thumping of Newcastle in 2008\n\nDec 26 2012 - Manchester United 4-3 Newcastle\n\nIn a fixture that has contained so much drama it was fitting that the final one held while Ferguson was still in charge at Old Trafford would end with a seven-goal thriller... and obviously a late, late winner for the hosts.\n\nNewcastle took the lead three times in this Boxing Day epic, with James Perch, a Jonny Evans own goal and a Papiss Cisse strike cancelled out by Evans (scoring at the correct end), Patrice Evra and Robin van Persie.\n\nBut as 'Fergie time' loomed, Javier Hernandez popped up for the hosts to grab a dramatic winner a minute before the end.\n\nJavier Hernandez scored a minute from time to seal a late Boxing Day win in 2012\n\nDec 7 2013 - Manchester United 0-1 Newcastle\n\nWith Ferguson gone, it didn't take long for Newcastle to take full advantage of his absence by registering their first league win at Old Trafford since 1972.\n\nDavid Moyes' reign was already coming under pressure having struggled to reach the same high standards during the Ferguson era.\n\nAnd a Toon side who were left crestfallen following their last gasp defeat a year earlier did not make the same mistake, with Yohan Cabaye's strike on the hour enough to secure their only Premier League win at Old Trafford.\n\nNewcastle's only Premier League win at Old Trafford came via Yohan Cabaye in 2013\n\nOct 6 2018 - Manchester United 3-2 Newcastle\n\nYou can count the amount of Alexis Sanchez's stellar Manchester United contributions on one hand but 12 months ago he rolled back the years by completing a United comeback that even Ferguson would have been proud of.\n\nJose Mourinho was coming under increasing pressure, and his reign as boss looked like it had just 20 minutes left with his side trailing 2-0 thanks to Newcastle goals from Kenedy and Yoshinori Muto.\n\nHowever, Juan Mata pulled a goal back before Anthony Martial equalised in the 76th minute.\n\nIn classic United fashion they then bombarded the Newcastle goal before Sanchez popped up to head home the winner in the final minute.", "description": "Title fights, media meltdowns, cup finals, stunning goals, dramatic comebacks and even the odd punch being thrown too.
