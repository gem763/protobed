Anchored by a gutsy performance by star Cynthia Erivo, the film is not out to radically reinvent our notion of Harriet Tubman: It\u2019s a straightforward historical epic about a national hero whose story has gone untold for too long. (A running joke on Twitter is that before this Tubman had previously only appeared on film in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.) There\u2019s a snarling slave owner played by Joe Alwyn, plenty of rousing emotional speeches, even blue-toned flashbacks to Harriet\u2019s past. If you\u2019ve seen a biopic before, you will not be surprised by much. But you may be surprised by one particular thing.\n\n(Mild spoilers to follow.)\n\nErivo\u2019s Harriet is a woman of outstanding gifts \u2014 she doesn\u2019t just have an undaunted spirit, and a fantastic singing voice, she also has an intense spiritual relationship with the Almighty. Just like the real Tubman did, she experiences flashes of images that she interprets as visions from God. (Upon hearing this, Leslie Odom Jr.\u2019s William Still dryly jots down \u201cpossible brain injury.\u201d) Gradually, both Harriet and the audience realize that those blue-tinted shots are not flashbacks, but flash-forwards \u2014 God showing her the way. If she and some runaway slaves are being pursued in a forest, the visions will tell her to turn left. When they get to a river, visions of waves spur her to swim across. It\u2019s a method to explain how the movie\u2019s Harriet has so much faith in her own mission, as well as a way of presenting the historical Tubman on her own terms, and it ends up spurring a rescue-mission montage, set to Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSinnerman,\u201d that\u2019s the clear highlight of the film.\n\nBut other times, it can\u2019t help but feel a bit like God has given Harriet Tubman superpowers. As the film escalates toward its big showdown, Harriet is able to subconsciously detect when the bad guys are closing in on her, almost as if she\u2019s got her very own spidey sense. And later, she reads a villain to filth by revealing to him the precise time and nature of his own death. The critical response to these moments has been mixed. \u201cContextualizing Harriet as the kind of person who fights for good against great odds, who achieves an improbable victory and demoralizes her foes isn\u2019t too far from reality anyway,\u201d notes Sarah Marrs at Laineygossip, while David Rooney of THR writes that these superhero elements \u201ccontribute to the sense of invulnerable sainthood that keeps [the movie\u2019s Harriet] at a slight remove.\u201d Which way will audiences lean when the movie hits theaters in November? Unlike Harriet, I can\u2019t see the future, but I\u2019m not personally in the habit of betting against superhero movies these days.", "description": "Kasi Lemmons\u2019s biopic \u201cHarriet,\u201d starring Cynthia Erivo, is a straightforward historical epic about a national hero, except when it\u2019s not.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/tiff/harriet-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
