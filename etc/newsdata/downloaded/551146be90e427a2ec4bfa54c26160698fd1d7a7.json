After Donald Trump, ignoring the advice of his foreign policy and national security teams, withdrew American troops, \u201ctotal chaos\u201d soon followed.\n\nAs we discussed yesterday, our Kurdish allies, abandoned by Trump and confronting \u201cbloody carnage,\u201d have now allied with Russia and Syria\u2019s Assad regime, largely because they needed a reliable ally and could no longer count on the United States. The Kurdish campaign against ISIS, not surprisingly, is effectively over, to the delight of the terrorist network.\n\nThe only real beneficiaries of the chaos Trump created are Russia, Syria, Iran, and ISIS.\n\nAnd yet, despite all of this, the American president was quite explicit this morning and making one thing clear: Trump simply does not care.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday downplayed the escalating tensions in the Middle East in the aftermath of his abrupt withdrawal of American troops from northeastern Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s not our border,\u201d Trump said speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Kurdish forces that, until recently, fought side by side with the United States forces as \u201cno angels.\u201d\n\nThe Republican went on to say his decision was \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d Trump added that American soldiers \u201care totally safe.\u201d\n\nThe president also said, in apparent reference to Turkish and Kurdish forces, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d Trump added that he believes the Kurds deliberately freed some ISIS prisoners in the hopes that he would say, \u201cOh gee, we gotta get back in there.\u201d\n\nAs difficult as this was to hear, Trump\u2019s extraordinary unscripted comments offered a peek into his rather twisted vision of the world.\n\nIt appears that Trump has settled on an exceedingly narrow view: global instability, rival powers, and allied bloodshed are, in his mind, entirely irrelevant. Syria is far away from the United States, which leads the president to believe events that unfold in Syria have no bearing on the United States.\n\nAnd while that\u2019s certainly one way to look at international affairs, there is an alternative approach. For example, some might argue that when the United States makes decisions that help Russia, Syria, Iran, and ISIS, that\u2019s failing to advance our interests. When our allies are betrayed and forge partnerships with our adversaries, that fails to advance our interests, too.\n\nWhen the United States abandons its role as a global leader, and others fill the vacuum, that also fails to advance our interests. When the world sees the United States abandon its allies, subject them to slaughter, and then suggest they somehow deserve the violence \u2013 because they are \u201cno angels\u201d \u2013 that fails to advance our interests, too.\n\nDonald Trump has no doubt heard the phrase that the American president is the \u201cleader of the free world.\u201d He made clear this morning, however, that he sees no value in filling such a role.\n\nAs for Trump justifying his indifference by asserting that American soldiers \u201care totally safe,\u201d there\u2019s ample evidence to the contrary. Following up on our earlier coverage, it was just a few days ago when U.S. troops were reportedly \u201cbracketed\u201d by Turkish artillery fire, which (a) put those American troops at risk; (b) meant an ostensible NATO ally was firing on our military servicemen and women; and (c) potentially left those Americans stuck in a highly volatile area, since Turkish forces control the nearby roads. By some accounts, an airlift may be necessary.\n\nThat Trump surveys this landscape and sees his decision as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d suggests he doesn\u2019t fully understand what the words \u201cstrategy\u201d and \u201cbrilliance\u201d mean.", "description": "As difficult as this was to hear, Trump's extraordinary unscripted comments offered a peek into his rather twisted vision of the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_msnbc_trump_server_191016_1920x1080.jpg?itok=zlgQzXXC", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
