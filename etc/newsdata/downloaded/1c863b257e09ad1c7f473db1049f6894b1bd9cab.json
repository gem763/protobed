Rather than shy away from the attention, Medvedev played into the crowd as he took the microphone and thanked them for encouraging him to victory.\n\n\"First of all I can say thank you all, guys, because your energy tonight gave me the win,\" Medvedev said. \"Because if you were not here, guys, I would probably lose the match, because I was so tired. I was cramping yesterday \u2014 it was so tough for me to play. So I want all of you to know when you sleep tonight: I won because of you.\" He then applauded the crowd and waved his arms to encourage his audience to boo more.\n\n\"Again, the only thing I can say is the energy you're giving me right now, guys, I think it will be enough for my five next matches,\" he concluded. \"The more you will do this, the more I will win \u2014 for you guys.\"\n\nThe boos from the crowd came after a tense match that was filled with attitude from Medvedev.\n\nDuring the first set of the match, Medvedev irked the Queens crowd after he angrily grabbed a towel from a ballperson in a somewhat aggressive fashion.\n\nMedvedev received a code violation for his action and responded by throwing his racket and slyly giving the middle finger to the umpire as he walked past his chair.\n\nAfter the match, Medvedev was notably calmer when discussing the win.\n\n\"I was in the heat of the moment. Started losing the momentum, so I mean, was tough,\" Medvedev said, per AP Sports. \"Was tough and I don't really remember. I mean, I paid for it the whole match after, because as you saw it wasn't easy. So I'm just happy to win.\"\n\n\"I'm working on myself and hopefully I will be better next time,\" he concluded.\n\nWith his victory, Medvedev advanced to the fourth round, where he will face off against Dominik Koepfer on Sunday.\n\nKobe Bryant says he sometimes used to wish that he played an individual sport like tennis instead of basketball\n\nCoco Gauff says she felt like the Golden State Warriors in Game 7 when the US Open crowd was chanting her name\n\nSimona Halep crashed out of the US Open after repeatedly smacking her racket on the court in an out-of-character meltdown\n\nNaomi Osaka won a US Open match in straight sets because she didn't want guests Kobe Bryant and Colin Kaepernick to 'sit in the sun too long'", "description": "Daniil Medvedev embraced his role as a villain at the US Open on Friday night, soaking up the boos of the crowd after his victory.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6aa1de2e22af5bd7288623-1920-960.jpg"}
