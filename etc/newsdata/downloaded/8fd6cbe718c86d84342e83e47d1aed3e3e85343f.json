John Yarmuth quoted Pelosi as saying Trump had told her that \u201che\u2019d like to figure this out,\u201d and Pelosi responded to Trump by saying, \u201cTell your people to obey the law.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Senate voted unanimously on Tuesday, with no objections from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, for a resolution calling for the whistleblower\u2019s report to be sent to Congress.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks to reporters as she arrives for a meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe House is due to vote on a similar non-binding resolution on Wednesday.\n\nEven if the Democratic-controlled House ultimately voted to impeach Trump, it would be unlikely to lead to his removal from office. Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate, where an impeachment ruling would need a two-thirds majority to pass.\n\nBut the process could damage the president\u2019s image as he vies for re-election, with polls showing that only about 45% of Americans approving of his performance as president, especially if damaging information comes out during public hearings.\n\nIt could also boost Trump if Americans believe Democrats are unfairly targeting the president.\n\nGlobal markets fell on Wednesday, partly on concerns of long-term political uncertainty in the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe U.S. dollar recovered early on Wednesday following the losses it suffered against most major currencies following the inquiry announcement.\n\nREPUBLICAN SUPPORT\n\nThe White House had refused to hand over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress, but an administration official said it was now preparing to release it by the end of the week and would most likely allow the whistleblower to meet with congressional investigators, though Democrats remained skeptical.\n\n\u201cI have a question of whether we are going to see a word-for-word transcript or if we are going to see an interpretation by someone who works for the president of the United States,\u201d Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN.\n\nFormer White House and national security officials have said any statement about the call is likely to be complied from written notes taken by U.S. officials who listened in on the conversation.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval among Republicans remains strong. A Sept. 16-20 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 82% of registered Republicans approved of his job performance.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the party\u2019s leader in the House, accused Democrats of seeking to overturn the 2016 election. \u201cThis is all about politics. Not about facts,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi had considered creating a select committee to lead the impeachment inquiry, but instead opted to rely on the House Judiciary, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and other committees already conducting probes of the Trump administration.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThose investigations will continue and committee leaders will decide whether to hold public hearings.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has said his panel was communicating with an attorney representing the whistleblower and that the individual would like to testify this week.\n\nThere will be a burst of hearings this week, but lawmakers then leave Washington for two weeks and will not return until after the Oct. 14 Columbus Day holiday.", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives were set on Wednesday to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, a move that could dramatically change the 2020 presidential race.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433767144&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O177", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
