While the player did violate the rules of the tournament he was competing in, it\u2019s Blizzard that\u2019s taking all the criticism for kicking him out.\n\nNg Wai Chung, known by his handle \u201cBlitzchung,\u201d was giving an interview last Sunday on a Taiwanese Hearthstone stream while wearing a gas mask. He shouted \u201cLiberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our age!\u201d in Chinese (thanks to Inven for the translation). The hosts dove behind their table at this, and the stream quickly cuts to an ad break. All official VODs of this interview have been scrubbed, but you can still find clips online:\n\nAfter the interview, Blizzard announced on the Hearthstone blog that it was removing Blitzchung from the Grandmasters tourney, stripping him of his winnings, and banning him from competing in any Hearthstone esports competitions for the next year. The specific rule he violated is one which forbids competitors from doing anything that \u201cbrings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate for just one sentence, that rule does seem like a pretty clear message from Blizzard to toe the line while you\u2019re in its spotlight. But this seems overly cruel considering Blitzchung is from Hong Kong \u2014 you\u2019d think if anyone should be allowed to voice an opinion on the situation, but sadly that\u2019s not how the world works. The salt on the wound is that Blizzard also broke with the casters who were doing the interview, even though their reactions would seem to prove they didn\u2019t know Blitzchung was going to say what he did.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t follow esports, it\u2019s easy to see why such a move from a prominent American company is ruffling feathers. Fans on the now-closed Blizzard subreddit were lighting the company up over this decision, saying they would no longer be playing Hearthstone or any of the company\u2019s games. Blizzard said it would \u201cstand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions\u201d but added \u201cplayers and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.\u201d\n\nPoliticians are now also jumping into the mix. Florida senator Marco Rubio accused Blizzard of knuckling under to Chinese authorities in order to retain access to the Chinese market.\n\nRecognize what\u2019s happening here. People who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone. https://t.co/Cx3tkWc7r6 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 8, 2019\n\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon tweeted something similar, saying that Blizzard was willing to \u201cwilling to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck. https://t.co/rJBeXUiwYS \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 8, 2019\n\nIn the middle of all this, I\u2019m thinking again of one of the major objections to the Epic Games Store. Earlier this year, when the PC Store Wars were getting heated, those who disliked the Epic Games Store in particular expressed reservations over the fact that Epic is, in part, owned by Chinese company Tencent. I won\u2019t dignify most of those comments \u2014 a lot of which had a more general anti-Chinese air than a simple objection to the Chinese government \u2014 by saying they\u2019re all worth listening to.\n\nBut it\u2019s interesting now that some are pointing to Tencent as the instigators of this incident, considering they also own a minority stake in Activision Blizzard (less than 5 percent). They\u2019re also responsible for the suspension of NBA broadcasting in China over a similarly supportive tweet from the manager of the Houston Rockets.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Blizzard for comment and will update this article if we receive it.\n\nRead next: Twitter says it used your 2FA info to advertise by accident", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FHearthstone-Cinematic.jpg&signature=f9c02704a91c0a559d52ceee40f70965", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
