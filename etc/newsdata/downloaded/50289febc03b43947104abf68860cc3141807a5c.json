Speaking to Inside Soap, she said: \u2018At the beginning of the year, I was thinking about my job at Emmerdale and how much I love it and how I\u2019d hate for it to become anything less than the job I adore.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So I\u2019m leaving now, but maybe one day I\u2019ll come back to it. Never say never. After all, Cain needs his mum.
