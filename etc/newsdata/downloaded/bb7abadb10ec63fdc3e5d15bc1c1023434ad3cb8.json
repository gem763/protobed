It\u2019s a true comet and the first we\u2019ve ever confirmed that comes from interstellar space, and the Hubble Space Telescope captured some amazing imagery of it. Good thing, too \u2014 because it\u2019s never coming back.\n\nYou probably remember \u2018Oumuamua as the interstellar object that launched a thousand headlines \u2014 mostly around the idea that it could be an alien ship of some kind. Needless to say that hypothesis didn\u2019t really pan out, but honestly the object was interesting enough without being an emissary from another world.\n\nThis new comet, called 2I/Borisov (not as catchy), was first identified in August by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov, who lives in Crimea. Studies by other near-Earth object authorities observed its trajectory and concluded that it did indeed come from interstellar space.\n\nHow do they know? Well, for one thing, it\u2019s going 110,000 miles per hour, or 177,000 kph. \u201cIt\u2019s traveling so fast it almost doesn\u2019t care that the Sun is there,\u201d said UCLA\u2019s David Jewitt, who leads the Hubble team watching 2I/Borisov. (Note that in the gif above, the streaks don\u2019t indicate its speed \u2014 those are from the Earth spinning.)\n\nBasically the angle it\u2019s coming in, plus the speed at which it\u2019s traveling, mean it can\u2019t possibly be in even a super-wide orbit of the Sun. It\u2019s just passing through \u2014 and in early December will be less than 200 million miles from the Sun. It\u2019s not on track to hit anything, fortunately, which would be a truly cosmic coincidence, so in a couple months it\u2019ll be gone again.\n\nBut its short visit is ample opportunity to study its makeup, which appears to be very similar to our own \u201clocal\u201d comets. Although it would be cool for 2I/Borisov to be super weird, its similarity is interesting in itself \u2014 it suggests that comet formation in other solar systems is not necessarily different.\n\nIt is, however, very different from \u2018Oumuamua, which appeared to be an inert, oblong rock. Interesting in its own way, but comets are so dynamic: clouds of dust and ice surrounding a much smaller core. Very picturesque, even if the tails don\u2019t always point the way you think they should.\n\nNote that these interstellar visitors are actually thought to be quite common, with perhaps thousands in the solar system at any given moment. But few are big and bright enough to be detected and studied.\n\nHubble will continue observing 2I/Borisov through January and perhaps beyond. If it\u2019s never going to return, we want to gather as much data as possible while we can.", "description": "The solar system has another interstellar visitor, but there's no question of this one being an alien spacecraft.
