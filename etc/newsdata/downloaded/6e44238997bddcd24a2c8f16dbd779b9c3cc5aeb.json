She was left in a coma, with massive head injuries.\n\nSheena McDonald, 66, who suffered head injuries after being hit by a police van in 1999, has documented her recovery in a new book with her husband Allan Little, 60, (pictured together)\n\nIt was a terrible reversal for the brilliant 44-year-old broadcast journalist, who at the time was on national radio or tv almost every night \u2014 immaculately made-up, presenting Channel 4 News and Right To Reply, introducing opera from Glyndebourne, hosting discussions for the bbc on politics and art. She was at the peak of her career, living in London, visiting her then boyfriend Allan for weekends wherever the BBC had sent him, be it Sarajevo, South Africa or Russia.\n\nAt the time of the accident they had been an item for only five years. They had never lived together and led quite separate, independent lives. \u2018We lived that fast, exciting, on-the-go life,\u2019 says Allan.\n\nIn their new book, Rebuilding Life After Brain Injury: Dreamtalk, which they co-wrote with Sheena\u2019s clinical neuro-psychologist Gail Robinson, Sheena admits that a year before the accident, she had asked Allan for some commitment.\n\n\u2018I guess I\u2019m just an old bachelor. A moody selfish old bachelor,\u2019 had been his rebuttal. \u2018Bear with me.\u2019\n\nWhen the accident happened \u2014 Sheena still prefers to call it \u2018the injury\u2019: \u2018Driving on the wrong side of the road is not an accident. You know you are doing it\u2019 \u2014 Allan was working as the bbc\u2019s chief correspondent in Moscow.\n\nHe flew through the night not knowing if she would survive or have irreparable brain damage. When he got to the intensive care unit at University College Hospital in London, Sheena was in a coma and on a ventilator \u2018in a cage of wires and tubes\u2019. She had a major facial fracture, running from above her eye, through the cheek and into the upper jaw.\n\nHer head had swelled to the size and colour of a blue pumpkin, her eye was somewhere in the middle of her face. The left side of her head \u2014 where, it\u2019s thought, the van\u2019s wing mirror hit her with tremendous force \u2014 was a mess of tissue and bone. Allan only recognised her by her feet and hairline.\n\nHe and her family kept a bedside vigil. \u2018The damage to my brain had been caused by my head being hit, forcing my brain to ricochet inside my skull,\u2019 says Sheena today.\n\nSheena (pictured at the scene of her crash) was knocked down by a police van driving on the wrong side of the road on February 26, 1999, just before midnight\n\nDoctors did not offer any kind of long-term prognosis of recovery. \u2018For a while I lost myself. I was no longer Sheena,\u2019 she adds simply.\n\nWhen, after four days, she gradually began to regain consciousness, she was suffering from almost total memory loss (post-traumatic amnesia) and only able to speak nonsense. For weeks she existed in \u2018a sort of in-between state between consciousness and unconsciousness\u2019, babbling in what Allan calls \u2018dreamtalk\u2019.\n\nShe didn\u2019t recognise Allan, assuming he was a doctor or childhood sweetheart. She couldn\u2019t remember what she had looked like, or that she had been a well-known broadcaster.\n\nHaving forgotten how to swallow, she was kept alive via a nasal feeding tube and lost 30lb.\n\nHer recollection of the 15 years before the accident was at first non-existent. She had no idea Princess Diana, whom she had met, had died. When Allan gently told her, she remarked thoughtfully: \u2018You know I don\u2019t think that\u2019s widely known.\u2019 Allan was torn between laughing and celebrating her new-found curiosity.\n\nHe took six months off work and, in April 1999, moved them back to their native Scotland. First Sheena was in hospital in Edinburgh, close to her parents, then they moved into a friend\u2019s cottage in East Lothian.\n\nLife was calmer in Scotland, but he couldn\u2019t leave her alone in the house for a minute in case she fell or choked. McDonald describes his care and determination as crucial to her recovery.\n\n\u2018This remarkable man stood by me and helped me to piece my battered brain together.\u2019\n\nSheena (pictured with Allan) had almost total memory loss and was kept alive via a nasal feeding tube\n\nTo improve her word skills and concentration, he played hundreds of games of Scrabble and Boggle with her and learned to do crosswords \u2014 before her injury, Sheena was a crossword fiend.\n\nBut he also had to live with Sheena when she was, as she puts it, \u2018anti-social, intolerable and unattractive\u2019.\n\nAs Allan writes eloquently in their book: \u2018A barrier had descended cutting Sheena and I off from our past life. I didn\u2019t know it yet, but there would be no going back to the way things had been before that day. You were entering a new country with an unfamiliar language and an unknown map.\u2019\n\nSheena says 75 per cent of relationships don\u2019t survive the type of brain injury she suffered. People lose their jobs, have to sell their house, their lives fall apart.\n\nWe talk about the stresses placed on the marriage of Olympic rower James Cracknell and Beverley Turner (now divorced) after he suffered a brain injury after being hit from behind by a petrol tanker while cycling. They express sympathy but stress every head injury is very different.\n\nNot only did Allan go from boyfriend to full-time carer, he was coping with Sheena\u2019s extreme mood swings caused by her injury. \u2018I got the blame for everything. I would come home from work not knowing which Sheena I was going to be greeted by.\u2019\n\nThe only thing that kept him going was knowing this was not the real Sheena. \u2018It was the injury talking and not the person you love.\u2019 But would she ever come back?\n\nSheena (pictured) experienced chronic fatigue and saw her weight escalate to 14st, as the part of her brain which controls appetite was damaged\n\nSheena cashed in a critical injury policy she\u2019d taken out, and the bbc helped Allan out with studio work and assignments as close as possible to home. But he recalls a workaholic producer saying accusingly: \u2018I think you\u2019re hiding behind Sheena\u2019s illness, using it as an excuse not to pull your weight.\u2019\n\nIn fact, Allan had two full-time jobs. For years Sheena was chronically fatigued. There were episodes of compulsive internet shopping. When friends visited, Sheena would talk over them or indulge in what Allan calls \u2018tangential talking\u2019 (disinhibited behaviour and lack of self-knowledge is part of a brain injury).\n\nWhen he took 48 hours off for a trip with a male friend, she refused to answer his calls and he returned home to find her sitting in the dark. He apologised and she said in a monotone: \u2018My mother said a leopard never changes his spots. She\u2019s right.\u2019\n\nDid she imagine her mother saying that about Allan? \u2018No, she\u2019d have said it. To this day she says what she thinks. She\u2019s now 90.\u2019\n\nWith no self-awareness, Sheena ignored mirrors and her weight rose to 14st (heavy for her 5ft 5in frame). Before the accident she rarely ate cake or chocolate. But the part of her brain that controlled her appetite was, and still is, damaged by the impact, and she didn\u2019t know when to stop eating.\n\n\u2018Allan was so pleased to see me eating after I lost so much weight, he allowed me to have second helpings and finish his plate. But there must be some neurological lever that doesn\u2019t operate.\n\n\u2018One day I was in a taxi and saw a very large woman waddling past. I asked Allan: \u201cAm I as big as her?\u201d He said: \u201cYes, nearly.\u201d\u2019 It was a huge shock.\n\n\u2018Denial played a very large part in the process,\u2019 she says, \u2018which is terrible for everybody else. Denial, luck and a lack of vanity.\u2019\n\nAlways so independent, Sheena became clingy and controlling.\n\nSheena (pictured in 1984) was referred to a psychologist at the Maudsley Hospital after venting her fury at Allan\n\nWhile all the attention was on Sheena\u2019s recovery, few people recognised the toll her brain injuries and behaviour had had on Allan. Out for drinks with friends, everyone was discussing Sheena\u2019s progress, when one friend asked Allan: \u2018And what about you? Who\u2019s looking after you?\u2019 The question \u2018hit him like a train\u2019. He walked away, tears rolling down his face.\n\n\u2018You have those moments of revelation when you realise how tired you are, and how much you are putting everybody else first,\u2019 he says today.\n\n\u2018And you had no reason to expect things would get better,\u2019 Sheena adds softly.\n\nOn millennium eve, their celebration together with friends in Moscow was interrupted when Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced he was stepping down to be replaced by President Putin.\n\nIt was a major moment in world history; of course Allan had to report on it, but Sheena was furious. The trip was, as Allan later recalled, \u2018a nightmare\u2019. He\u2019d only recently turned 40 \u2014 how was he going to have the working life he wanted?\n\nOne day after Sheena said something \u2018barbed and unkind\u2019, he told her. \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing left. I\u2019m emptied out.\u2019\n\nHe said he was going out for a walk and when he came back it was her turn to think of something to make it better. On his return Sheena hugged him silently.\n\nLater that year, Sheena was referred to a psychologist at the Maudsley Hospital. \u2018He asked me questions nobody had asked before, I went through a box of Kleenex.\u2019\n\nShe came to understand she was depressed, a classic consequence of serious head injury. He prescribed a Serotonin antidepressant and within six weeks her motivation returned. \u2018Being honest about it was important,\u2019 says Allan. \u2018You told the psychiatrist: \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be depressed\u201d and he said: \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to be short!\u201d Which is a line I imagine he uses a lot.\u2019\n\nSheena began freelancing after the couple (pictured) sought help from neuro-psychologist, Gail Robinson\n\nFortunately, a neuro-psychologist, Gail Robinson, kept seeing the couple for a further five years. Her role is to assess and help treat problems caused by a brain injury, so the person and their family are better able to cope with the impact the condition may have. \u2018I think she found us an interesting case study and she became a friend.\u2019\n\nReading Gail\u2019s notes at the time, she was clearly something of a relationship counsellor, too. She could see Allan was holding on by a thread and offered a safe space where the couple could speak freely. \u2018She was our neuro-psychologist. I was her patient, too, in a sense,\u2019 says Allan.\n\nYou work as a team, Gail tells me: \u2018It was like a contract, we agreed on goals. Instead of doing a very short intensive period of rehabilitation, it made sense to space it out, because Allan was sometimes overseas, and Sheena was trying to return to work, and because her injury was so severe, though most people wouldn\u2019t realise that now. Her recovery is extraordinary.\u2019\n\nSheena began to diet and exercise. Gail had begged her to keep a food diary. \u2018If you can\u2019t address your problems, everything I\u2019ve done will be useless.\u2019\n\nSoon Sheena started freelancing again and was well enough for Allan to take up the post of South Africa correspondent (a job he\u2019d loved six years earlier). The plan was for Sheena to join him in Johannesburg.\n\nBut she had so much work in London, she stayed put. She visited him, but worried she was driving him away. One day, she assumed, he would simply wake up and think \u2018this is not me! I\u2019m a lone wolf\u2019. Lesser men have crumpled.\n\n\u2018I never spent even a minute thinking about leaving,\u2019 he insists now. In fact, Allan was missing her in South Africa. It wasn\u2019t the same on his own. He told his bbc boss it had been a mistake. They allowed him to leave after a year to become bureau chief in Paris.\n\nSheena (pictured) who brought a civil action against the police for negligent driving, revealed she's still working on forgiveness\n\nShe tells a story of rushing out of the shower to take Allan his passport that he\u2019d forgotten for Paris to the railway station. She hadn\u2019t blowdried her hair so the angry, jagged scar across her right eyebrow was visible. Allan blanched when he saw her. It made her realise she had to do something about her appearance if it upset him, so she saw a plastic surgeon and had two procedures done on the nhs.\n\nToday, you\u2019d never guess Sheena is a trauma-survivor. Doctors have described her recovery as \u2018a miracle\u2019. Some credit her no-nonsense Scottish upbringing.\n\n\u2018When I was in intensive care, my poor mother sat by my bed every day and one day lent over and said: \u201cGet a grip, Sheena.\u201d She felt so guilty about it afterwards. But, ridiculously I think something in me heard it.\u2019\n\nGetting justice has been in some ways harder. The cps charged the police officer who hit Sheena with \u2018driving without due care and attention\u2019. At the end of 1999 a trial was held and the case was dismissed. Worse still, the police evidence highlighted Sheena\u2019s drinking. In fact, she had consumed just one glass of wine after attending a scholarly talk at bafta.\n\nLater, she brought a civil action against the police for negligent driving, and the Met settled out of court. It wasn\u2019t enough to pay off a mortgage, she observes dryly.\n\nToday, she\u2019s still working on forgiveness. \u2018It\u2019s a very difficult thing to achieve, full-stop.\u2019\n\nWas it painful remembering that awful time when writing their new book with Gail to help others with brain injury? \u2018No, it was useful,\u2019 says Allan. \u2018It was like packing it away and saying: \u201cThis is what happened.\u201d When I was going through it, I wanted to read someone else\u2019s account of walking the path and there was nothing.\u2019\n\nSheena (pictured) has lost her sense of smell and can't drive, but the couple say they hardly think about the accident 20 years on\n\nThe last thing they wanted to write was misery-lit. \u2018I said we can\u2019t sugar coat anything. We have to be absolutely brutally frank,\u2019 he adds. \u2018Self-pity has never been part of our lives.\u2019 Designed as a resource to help other brain injury victims and their partners, the book reads like an emotional thriller as you wonder if the couple will be able stay together.\n\nIn fact, going through the accident brought them closer. Sheena is less of a workaholic; Allan says it made him more emotionally intelligent. \u2018It makes you think of your own vulnerability in ways you wouldn\u2019t be expected to, especially as a man.\u2019 It also led to a proper commitment.\n\nIn Scotland on Christmas Day 2005, they hosted lunch for her family. After the guests had left they exchanged gifts. Sheena can\u2019t remember what she gave Allan, but will never forget Allan\u2019s present \u2014 an engagement ring. She has never taken it off since.\n\nThey were married on June 24, 2006 \u2014 Sheena\u2019s father, the Rt Rev Dr Bill Mcdonald, conducted the service. \u2018I knew we had to be together. I understood it was the only way I wanted to live,\u2019 says Allan.\n\n\u2018This wasn\u2019t a conversation he had with me,\u2019 says Sheena airily. \u2018So I was genuinely absolutely amazed that Christmas Day.\u2019\n\nBoth she and Allan accept they now live in a \u2018new normal\u2019. She has lost her sense of smell, can\u2019t drive and will take the lift, not the stairs. But 20 years later, the couple insist they never really think about the accident any more. \u2018We\u2019ve never let it define our lives.\u2019\n\nRebuilding Life After Brain Injury: Dreamtalk by Sheena McDonald, Allan Little and Gail Robinson is published by Routledge at \u00a319.99.", "description": "Sheena McDonald, 66, who suffered head injuries after being hit by a police van on February 26, 1999, has detailed her recovery in a new book with her husband of 13 years, Allan Little, 60.", "authors": ["Liz Hoggard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665324-0-image-a-24_1570998592905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
