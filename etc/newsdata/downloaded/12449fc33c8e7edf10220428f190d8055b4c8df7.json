Putting too much stock in a small sample size might cause you to make a decision that hurts you in the long run. That said, it doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be taking stock of what\u2019s happened in the immediate past. It can be useful when it comes to weekly or especially daily lineup decisions, waiver wire considerations, tracking who might be coming into more playing time, etc.\n\nThe Rotoworld Player Rater is a handy tool that\u2019s among the extensive offerings in Season Pass . Each week, I\u2019ll be using the Player Rater to look at the hottest hitters, position by position, over the last week, and providing commentary.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n*The following data is based on 5x5 Roto scoring and covers games played from August 19-September 1.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass .

The 37-year-old\u2019s bat has been feeble for most of this season as he battled through a nagging thumb injury, but he\u2019s suddenly caught fire over the last couple weeks with a .465/.549/.837 batting line, four homers and 11 RBI across 13 games. He\u2019s notched multiple hits in each of his last five starts. Perhaps the thumb ailment is finally behind him, and if that\u2019s the case Molina is suddenly looking like a viable fantasy option down the stretch \u2026 Victor Caratini\u2019s production right after Willson Contreras (hamstring) went down was lacking, but he\u2019s gone 11-for-24 with three bombs over his last seven contests. Caratini and Jonathon Lucroy have split playing time evenly since the latter was signed, although Caratini received some starts at first base, as well, while Anthony Rizzo (back) was banged up. Contreras is due back later this week \u2026 Gary Sanchez is closing in on a new career high in home runs following a two-homer game over the weekend. The slugging catcher has needed just 411 plate appearance to reach 32 home runs, with eight of those dingers coming across 20 games since he returned from a groin injury \u2026\n\nFirst Base\n\nAfter slugging a pinch-hit, walk-off home run in Sunday\u2019s comeback win over the A\u2019s, Mike Ford has now hit five over the boards across his last six games and nine in 25 contests since his recall in early August. He has started just one of three games since Luke Voit (abdomen) returned from the IL, although the Yankees faced lefties in two of those tilts. Ford has gone deep 33 times between the majors and minors this season and rarely strikes out for a power hitter (16 percent). There\u2019s deep league potential with him as long as he\u2019s playing against right-handers \u2026 C.J. Cron looked initially like he still might be feeling his thumb malady for the first couple weeks after being activated, but he\u2019s since homered five times and driven in 15 runs over his last 12 games, which has included a stretch of going deep in each of his last three starts. Cron does nothing for you when he\u2019s not hitting homers, but he\u2019s certainly useful when in the midst of a nice power stretch \u2026 Josh Bell has run hot and cold in the second half, but the good news is it\u2019s been more of the former of late, with the first baseman putting up a 1.114 OPS with four long balls and 11 RBI across his last nine games. As he has been throughout his career, Bell has been much more productive against right-handers (1.031 OPS) than he has versus left-handers (.705 OPS) \u2026\n\nSecond Base\n\nJonathan Villar has reached 20 home runs for the season after five long balls over his last 12 tilts, giving him his first 20-20 campaign. He\u2019s one of only five players so far to go 20-20 in 2019, and only he and Ronald Acuna have done so with 30+ steals. Villar ranks just outside the top 10 among all fantasy hitters this season \u2026 Ronny Rodriguez is getting a chance to play regularly again following his recall last month and has taken advantage with six home runs and a .955 OPS over his last 13 contests. He\u2019s batted cleanup for the Tigers in seven of his last eight starts. The plate discipline with Rodriguez remains awful, but he\u2019s a flyball hitter with multi-position eligibility and is in a good spot in the lineup, even if that lineup is dreadful. Perhaps he can manage to be somewhat useful for a bit longer \u2026 Speaking of favorable spots in the lineup, Kolten Wong has risen from the bottom of the Cardinals\u2019 order to the No. 2 spot. The second baseman boasts a 1.006 OPS in the second half to push his season OPS over .800 for the first time since early May. Wong is just one stolen base shy of his second 20-steal season and he\u2019s been caught only two times all year \u2026\n\nThird Base\n\nAnthony Rendon is hitting a ridiculous .402/.460/.738 with nine home runs and 31 RBI over 27 contests since the beginning of August. The impending free agent has reached the 30-homer mark for the first time in his career and he\u2019s done so while maintaining his elite plate discipline with a 10.5 percent walk rate and just a 13.8 percent strikeout rate. His 47.8 percent hard-hit rate also ranks in the top eight percent of the league \u2026 The red-hot Eugenio Suarez has gone deep 11 times over his last 25 tilts and six times across his previous nine contests, with his long ball on Sunday giving him No. 40 on the season. Suarez is striking out more than ever (28.3 percent) and his 40.4 percent hard-hit rate is pretty ordinary. However, he\u2019s hitting more flyballs than ever (41.4 percent) and pulling the ball more than ever (52.8 percent) and obviously that\u2019s leading to a boatload of home runs \u2026 Tommy Edman has remained the preferred option at third base even after Matt Carpenter returned from the injured list nearly a month ago. It\u2019s not difficult to see why, as Edman is sporting a .323/.356/.434 batting line over that stretch while Carpenter is hitting only .214/.333/.343. Edman is hitting lower in the order now, which obviously limits his potential, but there\u2019s still a little appeal here with his speed and multi-position eligibility \u2026\n\nShortstop\n\nKevin Newman certainly took advantage of series in Philadelphia and Colorado last week and over his last eight games is now an absurd 18-for-35 (.514) with three home runs, 10 RBI, 13 runs scored and two stolen bases. Newman remains in the bottom five percent of the league both in hard-hit rate (25.9 percent) and exit velocity (84.7 mph), but he\u2019s in the top four percent in strikeout rate (11.5 percent) and xBA (.295) \u2026 Jorge Polanco\u2019s average almost dropped below .290 a couple weeks ago for the first time since early April, but he\u2019s roared back with a 1.134 OPS, three home runs, 10 RBI and 17 runs scored over his last 14 games. Polanco has continued to be a disappointment in the stolen base department \u2013 he hasn\u2019t even attempted one in the second half \u2013 but he\u2019s reached the 20-homer plateau for the first time, is going to cruise to 100 runs scored and could hit .300, as well \u2026 Speaking of cruising to 100 runs scored, Marcus Semien is just two away from reaching the century mark for the first time and he\u2019s also slugged eight home runs and put up a .925 OPS since the beginning of August. The underrated Semien has been a top-10 option at a loaded shortstop position \u2026\n\nOutfield\n\nAs if the Yankees were running short on firepower, it\u2019s looking like the old Aaron Judge is back following a 12-game stretch during which he\u2019s homered seven times while posting a 1.221 OPS. Judge\u2019s Statcast data has been elite even in the midst of his \u201cstruggles,\u201d as his hard-hit rate (58.8 percent), exit velocity (96.4 mph) and barrel rate (20.1 percent) all rank in the top one percent of baseball. Judge\u2019s flyball rate has dipped down to 29.4 percent this season, but it\u2019s sitting at 39.4 percent during the aforementioned 12-game span \u2026 Brian Goodwin\u2019s playing time was cut after Justin Upton returned from his toe injury earlier this season, but he\u2019s starting to earn it back thanks to a robust 1.044 OPS and eight home runs since the All-Star break. He\u2019s even batter first or third in the Angels\u2019 last four games. Goodwin is going to have some fantasy appeal while he\u2019s batting directly before or behind Mike Trout even if his power/speed upside isn\u2019t super high \u2026 Mark Canha has assumed everyday center fielder duties for the A\u2019s and is also batting fourth or fifth for them lately thanks to a terrific second half that\u2019s seen him hit .311/.407/.575 with 11 dingers, 27 RBI and 27 runs scored over 44 tilts. Canha has remained a flyball hitter and is sporting a 51.4 percent pull rate that\u2019s easily a career high. That\u2019s helped lead to his power breakout (and the juiced ball hasn\u2019t hurt) \u2026 Nicholas Castellanos last Friday had his second multi-homer game as a Cub and has already gone deep as many times with his new club (11) over 29 contests than he did with the Tigers across 100 games. His HR/FB rate this year with Detroit was 9.2 percent. With Chicago? 31.4 percent \u2026", "description": "Ryan Boyer highlights and analyzes the hottest hitters using Rotoworld's Season Pass Player Rater.
