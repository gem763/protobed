Rugby World Cup semi-final: England vs New Zealand predicted team 1/24 England vs New Zealand Here's the team Eddie Jones should select for the Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. AFP via Getty Images 2/24 1. Mako Vunipola After coming through his first start in five months last weekend with flying colours, Eddie Jones knows he has one of his genuine world class players to call upon from the start. Vunipola completely changes the way that England\u2019s pack are able to impose themselves on the opposition, which enables the likes of Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi to reap the benefits.

England\u2019s lineout has been lauded by this correspondent as currently the best in the world \u2013 now it\u2019s time for them to prove it. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler His excellent display against Australia felt like a breakout performance that will have filled him with confidence ahead of what will be the biggest game of his career since the Lions tour. Sinckler is proving one of the gems in the pack that is proving his class by the minute. Getty Images, 5/24 4. Maro Itoje If New Zealand could have one player from the England side in their squad, it would be Itoje. The dynamic forward has been one of England\u2019s most consistent performers in Japan and has led their turnover charts, proving what a thorn he is in the backside of opponents. AFP via Getty Images 6/24 5. George Kruis He has swapped places with Courtney Lawes throughout the tournament and I\u2019d expect no different for this occasion, given the emphasis that Eddie Jones has put on the lineout. Kruis also brings extra bulk in the carrying department. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry Man of the match against Australia at the age of 21, Curry now has a target on his back that the Kiwis will have spotted. His place could have been at risk in order to play Courtney Lawes to strengthen the lineout, but breaking up the \u2018Undercurry\u2019 duo would be a travesty. Getty Images, 8/24 7. Sam Underhill The second part of England\u2019s dynamic flank duo, Underhill has proven worth his weight in gold in Japan, having formed a back-row of the likes that England have never seen before. Getty Images, 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola With fitness concerns and burnout fears done and dusted, Vunipola is the easy choice at No 8. AFP via Getty Images 10/24 9. Ben Youngs One of the survivors of the victorious 2012 team, Youngs has had a good World Cup up until now, but he will need to be at his very best to outshine opposite number Aaron Smith. AFP via Getty Images 11/24 10. George Ford A surprise choice, but one that makes sense. New Zealand lack a big ball-carrier in the centre unless they select Sonny Bill Williams, which given how Steve Hansen has gone this tour looks unlikely. In which case, England need the creativity that Ford and Farrell bring together. AFP via Getty Images 12/24 11. Jonny May There\u2019s a big concern over his hamstring, but if\u2019s he\u2019s close to fully fit May is worth the gamble. He proved his lethal finishing ability against the Wallabies, and the All Blacks know what he can do given his famous try at Twickenham in 2014. Getty 13/24 12. Owen Farrell The move to inside centre would be a surprise, but Farrell appeared to regain his confidence last weekend as displayed by his 100 per cent kicking ability. His appearance in this week\u2019s press conference said as much, and it\u2019s worth remembering that he and Ford know what to do together. Getty Images, 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi Can he rekindle the 2012 Manu Tuilagi that blew New Zealand away? His recent form suggests he could well do so, and New Zealand know they need to hatch a plan to contain him when he\u2019s given the space out wide. Getty Images, 15/24 14. Anthony Watson The wing utilised his footwork supremely well against Australia, and having been faced with the powerhouse that was Marika Koroibete last week, George Bridge should be a welcome release. Getty Images, 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Jones\u2019s go-to man at full-back, Daly needs something closer to what he produced against Argentina than the Australia game. AFP via Getty Images 17/24 16.

Jack Nowell Getty Images\n\nFor Tuilagi, Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final could come full circle. Incredibly it was a nearly seven years ago that Tuilagi was part of the last England side the defeat New Zealand. Twice they have come close, losing by a solitary point on the summer tour of 2014 and again last November, but it has been six games on the trot that the All Blacks have ran out winners.\n\nIt would be a fair assessment to say that Tuilagi has not reached the highs of that Twickenham afternoon seven years ago since due to a culmination of injury and ill-discipline, but there are clear signs that the best times may be in front of the Leicester back. He will make his 10th start for England in 2019 \u2013 and his 12th appearance in total \u2013 and has already bagged himself two tries and a man-of-the-match award in the victory over Tonga at this tournament, but the real challenge comes in trying to be a part of the first side to beat New Zealand at a World Cup since 2007.\n\nHowever, Tuilagi is one of just eight players within this England squad who knows what it feels like to beat the All Blacks while wearing the red rose, and he is fully aware that what happened under Stuart Lancaster\u2019s watch will have little-to-no bearing on what plays out in Yokohama this weekend.\n\n\u201cEveryone just did their job, not do anything amazing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was all about each player, one to 23, doing their job as well as they can and that is exactly what we need to do this weekend, just focus on your own job and do it the best you can. Then the performance will take care of itself.\n\n\u201cIt was a good day and a good win, but it\u2019s not about that day now \u2013 it\u2019s all about Saturday. You take the learnings from the game and hopefully put them into this game at the weekend.\u201d\n\nAs has been well documented, Tuilagi was firmly of the opinion that this day would not come for him. His appearance against New Zealand in June 2014 \u2013 which came out on the wing \u2013 was to be his last England start for four years and eight months, and there was a time when not only did it feel like Tuilagi\u2019s time with England had ended, but England\u2019s time with Tuilagi had wound up too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, for me, you\u2019ve got to enjoy every moment,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the big moment. Sometimes you forget, with everything that\u2019s going on, but when you really think about it, this is the dream come true and you\u2019ve got to enjoy every moment of it. If you enjoy it; that will allow you to do your job.\u201d\n\nFor Tuilagi, his job this weekend could not be any clearer.", "description": "Manu Tuilagi spent his childhood watching the All Blacks, dreaming of one day becoming the next Jonah Lomu.
