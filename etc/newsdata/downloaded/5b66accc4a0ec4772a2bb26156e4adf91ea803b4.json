But she also brought along a colorful accessory that made fans and the fashion world take notice.\n\nThe author and \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d star held a clutch by Edie Parker, who has also designed custom handbags for Katy Perry and Emma Roberts, among other stars.\n\nCox\u2019s bag featured a rainbow design on one side, along with lettering that reads, \u201cOct. 8, Title VII, Supreme Court.\u201d The other side features the transgender flag, along with the hashtag #TRANSISBEAUTIFUL.\n\nAccording to Vogue, Cox collaborated with Parker on the design, which refers to three LGBTQ discrimination cases to be heard by the Supreme Court this fall.\n\nOn Oct. 8, justices will begin hearings on the cases of Donald Zarda and Gerald Bostock, who were allegedly fired from their jobs for being gay. They\u2019ll also hear arguments in the case of Aimee Stephens, who claims she was dismissed from her job for being transgender.\n\nCollectively, the court\u2019s ruling will decide whether LGBTQ workers are protected by the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which \u201cprohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\u201d\n\nIn an amicus brief filed last month, the Trump administration argued that the 55-year-old civil rights law cannot be interpreted to ban discrimination against LGBTQ workers because it was not the original intention of the legislation\u2019s authors.\n\nFrazer Harrison via Getty Images Laverne Cox brought a rainbow-striped Edie Parker clutch to the 2019 Emmy Awards on Sunday that boasted a pro-LGBTQ message.\n\nA three-time Emmy nominee for her role as Sophia Burset on \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d Cox said her interest in raising awareness about the significance of the upcoming Supreme Court ruling made her appearance at Sunday\u2019s ceremony more meaningful.\n\n\u201cThis current administration is telling the Supreme Court to make discrimination against LGBTQ people legal,\u201d Cox told Vogue. \u201cVery few people are talking about this crucial case. I hope this will get people talking about the implications for LGBTQ people and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has implications for women and anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to someone else\u2019s idea of how you should be,\u201d she added in an interview with E! News. \u201cA man or woman or neither.\u201d\n\nCox attended the Emmys with lawyer Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The organization is representing Stephens and Zarda in their cases.\n\nI will fight every day of my life for our beautiful community. On October 8 the Supreme Court will have more trans people in attendance than any time in history. We will call into that space all who died so we could live and fight. #RiseUpOctober8 #TransIsBeautiful pic.twitter.com/XpepCrpp1v \u2014 Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cThis is actually going to transform the lives of LGBTQ people. And people who are not LGBTQ. Anyone who departs from sex stereotypes, like all the fabulous people here, for example,\u201d Strangio said. \u201cSo we really need to show up Oct. 8 and pay attention. Their lives are on the line.\u201d", "description": "The \"Orange is the New Black\" star's Edie Parker purse drew attention to a discrimination lawsuit to be heard by the Supreme Court this fall.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f5e4210000f605dab0dc.jpeg?cache=awzlnkxu3w&ops=1778_1000"}
