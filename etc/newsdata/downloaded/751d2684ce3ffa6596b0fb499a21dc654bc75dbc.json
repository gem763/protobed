I also suggest that, when appropriate, you create meaningful dialogue around the subject in your classrooms. These can be difficult conversations, but we must be willing to engage in them. Moreover, we need to create discourses in our classrooms that can counter some of the false and misleading information students are receiving from some of these groups.\n\n\u201cOn October 7th, the local chapter of Turning Point USA will host the visit of Charlie Kirk,\u201d continued the email, claiming that Kirk\u2019s group is linked to white supremacy. \u201cSeveral colleagues in CLA [College of Liberal Arts] and other colleges are collaborating with student organizations that are planning an alternative event or teach-in on the same day.\u201d\n\nRice mentioned, however, that members of the campus community who were critical of TPUSA had never made an effort to speak with the conservative students, to find out what they really believe in.\n\n\u201cNo one ever talked to us, so they would never know who we are actually,\u201d said Rice. \u201cWe all have strong moral characters. This is why it\u2019s so upsetting \u2014 we all come from a good place in our hearts. We\u2019re all very loving people, we genuinely love every single person.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by promoting hate against us on campus \u2014 through this email \u2014 there was constantly always something around the corner. I would go to class, and there would be posters with our logo \u2014[they] put, \u2018UNR protects racists, conservative groups are a place for white supremacists,\u2019 stuff like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was slander, everywhere I went, every single lecture hall, every building,\u201d said Rice, \u201cand it is to be believed that it\u2019s coming down from the highest points of position in this university, and they\u2019re encouraging students and teaching them that it\u2019s okay to silence conservatives on campus.\u201d\n\nOne week before the Kirk\u2019s scheduled appearance at UNR, a leftist student approached a TPUSA recruiting table, where group members were promoting the upcoming event.\n\n\u201cThis individual came up to us, and he started acting aggressive, arguing with us,\u201d explained Rice. \u201cAt one point \u2014 his body language was just very uneasy. We had valuables on the table \u2014 my laptop and a portable speaker. We started taking those off the table, in fear that he might do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the minute we took off our last valuable thing, the individual just came at us and flipped the table,\u201d said Rice. \u201cOur table was destroyed, coffee went everywhere. I know coffee went all over our pants, and the individual just ended up running away.\u201d\n\nThe incident was caught on video, and later posted to Kirk\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nWow: This intolerant leftist pretends he is curious about my upcoming visit to @unevadareno He then violently throws over our @TPUSA chapter table and sprints away@RenoPolice needs to look into this destruction of property & targeting of conservatives RT so they can't ignore pic.twitter.com/WknR3OjvtL \u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 1, 2019\n\nAccording to the University of Nevada, Reno Police Department, the man \u201cwas arrested for Destruction of Property and Disturbing the Peace. He was taken to the Washoe County Jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI applaud our campus police for acting so quickly and diligently to hold this person accountable,\u201d said Rice, \u201cbut that was only our campus police, the university didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nMarlow mentioned that the left has changed the definition of \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe definition of white supremacy used to be you actually had to think white people are superior to other races,\u201d said Marlow. \u201cNow [the definition] is simply, you are a right-of-center person and you don\u2019t hate the president, even if you\u2019re a black person. Remember, Candace Owens is a \u2018black white supremacist,\u2019 according to the left.\u201d\n\nRice added that despite all of the slander being directed toward her group, it did help with TPUSA recruitment, as students have witnessed first-hand the propaganda being promoted by the left, which in turn, has motivated conservative students to see to it that their voices are not silenced.\n\n\u201cBecause colleges are controlled by leftist faculty and students, I initially thought there was going to be less conservative [students], but as I started getting out there and recruiting, there was a lot more than I thought,\u201d noted Rice.\n\n\u201cMany of them did not have a voice on our campus and were afraid to speak up,\u201d she added, \u201cbut by doing this event, it allowed me to recruit them on my team and help other conservatives that did not have a voice before.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "University of Nevada, Reno student Kendall Rice told Breitbart News that her Turning Point USA (TPUSA) group received push-back from school's assistant dean, who sent out an email likening the organization \u2014 which recently hosted its annual\u00a0Black Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C. \u2014 to \"white supremacy.\" Rice spoke to SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow on Wednesday for the show's weekly TPUSA campus report.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Donald-Trump-embraces-black-TPUSA-member-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
