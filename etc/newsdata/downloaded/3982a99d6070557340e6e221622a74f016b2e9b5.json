You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe confusion came after it emerged that three million of the coins were to be imprinted with the Brexit date of 31 October and ready to spend by the end of the month.\n\nTreasury sources told the Daily Telegraph that the coins had to be approved at the privy council so the coins had \"legal tender status for when it is introduced on the day we leave\".\n\nOne source said: \"Three million will be ready for exit day and 10 million will be struck within the first year.\"\n\nThe new 50p pieces were due to be emblazoned with the words \u201cpeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u201d and the 31 October date of the UK's anticipated departure from the EU.\n\nA further seven million were then due to be minted over the course of year \u2013 considerably more than the 10,000 commemorative coins planned by Mr Javid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond.\n\nThe Royal Mint regularly issues commemorative currency, with notable coins minted in honour of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
