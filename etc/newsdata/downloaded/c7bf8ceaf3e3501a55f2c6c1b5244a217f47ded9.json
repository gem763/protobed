REUTERS/Sergio Maldonado\n\nRich or poor, residents are anxiously hoping the labor dispute will end so the company reopens the plant, which has been an anchor of the local economy since GM arrived a generation ago, transforming the landscape forever.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors is the biggest source of income here. When General Motors stops, everything stops,\u201d said Silao resident Francisco Vazquez. \u201cBefore General Motors, there was nothing.\u201d\n\nOnce a provincial backwater with a handful of colorful old churches, Silao is now enveloped in a thick cordon of factories and warehouses serving automotive companies from all over the world.\n\nIn the years after GM opened the Silao plant in 1995, dozens of other firms followed, such as Volkswagen, Continental and Pirelli. Meanwhile the city\u2019s home state, Guanajuato, drew in plants from carmakers including Mazda, Honda and Toyota.\n\nTensions over the future of manufacturing in North America are at the heart of the mass GM walkout. The debate has pitted U.S. labor advocates eager to reduce Mexico\u2019s cost advantage against Mexican trade unions fighting to protect local jobs.\n\nIn the United States, the average GM assembly employee earns about $30 per hour before tax. By contrast, an assembly worker in Silao with 10 years experience was, until the shutdown, getting about $4.50 per hour before tax, including benefits like shopping vouchers, according to a pay-slip he showed Reuters.\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he pledged to bring back manufacturing jobs lost since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in 1994. He also vowed to slash illegal immigration from Mexico.\n\nYet Silao\u2019s labor leaders say moving jobs from Mexico to the United States will only increase pressure on Mexican workers to migrate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep jobs in Mexico for the sake of the United States,\u201d said Hugo Varela, the Guanajuato boss of Mexico\u2019s CTM trade union confederation, which represents GM workers. \u201cIt\u2019s what stops migration to the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t jobs here, people will try to cross.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the GM strike has Mexican business leaders worried that industrial unrest could spread here, where the leftist government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to help strengthen trade unions.\n\nMore than a dozen local workers, union officials and contractors of GM told Reuters their priority was defending local jobs. There has been little indication that Mexican autoworkers will show solidarity with the UAW.\n\nEMPTY PARKING LOTS, ODD JOBS\n\nOperations at the GM Silao plant ground to a halt on Oct. 1. Vast parking lots in front of the cream-yellow building were mostly empty this week. Fast food sellers set up on the perimeter of the sprawling plant complained business was bad, and local GM workers said they were trying to make ends meet with odd jobs.\n\nThe GM worker with the pay-slip said that during his furlough he was only receiving 55% of his regular wage. He shook his head when asked if he might strike to pressure GM for full pay. His chief concern, he said, was to keep his job - or ensure a proper severance.\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019d go on strike if they tried to take the plant away,\u201d said the GM worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because he worried he could be fired for talking to the media.\n\nThe Silao shutdown has sparked temporary layoffs at another GM site in Mexico and some major suppliers locally, including American Axle & Manufacturing (AXL.N), employees said.\n\nIn Washington, the GM strike has complicated Trump\u2019s push to get Congress to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the trade deal he brokered to replace NAFTA.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers allied with unions are resisting, saying Mexico must do more to implement tougher labor rules.\n\nU.S. and Canadian unions accuse their Mexican peers of flouting international standards to undercut them, and hope tougher laws will make Mexico less attractive to offshoring.\n\nOver the past two decades, Mexican annual automobile output has jumped 165% to more than 4.1 million according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, lifting Mexico from 11th to 6th place in the global rankings.\n\n\u201cGETTING DESPERATE\u201d\n\nBy July 2019, the automotive industry made up more than 30% of the value of Mexico\u2019s total exports. Some 80% of those are sent to the United States, making Mexico highly sensitive to U.S. industrial disputes.\n\nThe U.S. strike at the No. 1 U.S. carmaker began on Sept. 16, with its 48,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union seeking more pay and job security, a bigger share of company profits and protection of healthcare benefits.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn Silao, fears about the local economy are growing.\n\nJose Juan Campos, a contractor who said he had worked regularly at the GM plant from its opening until the strike, said he had never known a stoppage like it and that the firm was unlikely to take back many workers before Christmas.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting desperate,\u201d he said.", "description": "Half a continent away from the auto plants of Detroit, U.S. strikes at General Motors (GM) have sent shivers through the central Mexican city of Silao, where the local GM factory furloughed 6,000 workers last week when parts from the United States ran out.", "authors": ["Dave Graham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439866679&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A24L", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
