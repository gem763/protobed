Hyperbole is a classic Trumpian reflex. It\u2019s not enough for U.S. forces to vanquish an enemy leader; it has to be the most menacing terrorist the nation has ever confronted\u2014even though bin Laden orchestrated the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\n\nBaghdadi, Trump said, \u201cis the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This [Baghdadi] is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, \u2018a country,\u2019 a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\nGraeme Wood: Baghdadi\u2019s final humiliation\n\nObama\u2019s role in finding and killing bin Laden has been on Trump\u2019s mind for years. When fielding questions after his statement, Trump referenced a book he released the year before the 9/11 attack, The America We Deserve, that he said warned bin Laden must be killed. (This is false.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get any credit for this, but that\u2019s okay. I never do,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.\n\nAs ever, there\u2019s a tweet from years past that\u2019s relevant to the moment. In 2012, Trump tweeted that Obama \u201cworks hard to take all the credit away from\u201d the Navy SEALs who killed bin Laden in a compound in Pakistan. Yesterday morning, Trump pointed to the centrality of his own contribution. Since his first day in office, \u201cI would say, Where is al-Baghdadi? I want al-Baghdadi. We would kill terrorist leaders, but there were names I never heard of \u2026 I kept saying, Where is al-Baghdadi? And a couple of weeks ago, they were able to scope him out.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment about Trump\u2019s messaging tactics.\n\nNews of the successful raid comes at an auspicious moment for Trump. Impeachment hearings are producing a trove of revelations that Trump and his underlings pressured Ukraine into digging up political dirt on his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. With Baghdadi\u2019s death, Trump can try to shift the conversation and showcase his credentials as commander in chief. He can recount this story on the campaign trail for the next 12 months, delighting his base with details that he learned\u2014and can declassify at will\u2014while watching the operation unfold in real time.\n\nRead: Trump has no room for error in 2020\n\nTrump returned to the White House around 4:20 p.m. ET Saturday after playing golf at his private club in Northern Virginia with two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and David Perdue, and Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. Then, at about 5 p.m., Trump said he went down to the Situation Room to watch the raid along with Vice President Mike Pence; General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Defense Secretary Mark Esper; and others.", "description": "The president\u2019s detailed account of the raid that killed the leader of ISIS was particularly Trumpian.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/TrumpGW/facebook.jpg?1572194087", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
