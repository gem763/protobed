So what does this mean for stocks?\n\n\u201cFor equities, remember we\u2019ve seen something like this twice and had two very different results,\u201d Renaissance Macro\u2019s Neil Dutta noted in an email. \u201cDuring the [President Richard] Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started. During the [President Bill] Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps these political events are eventually overwhelmed by the fundamentals?\u201d Dutta asked rhetorically.\n\nOn one hand, the historical sample size is very small. On the other hand, you could argue that no one president is bigger than the pistons powering the economy.\n\nCiti Private Bank strategists circulated the annotated charts above in a note to clients noting \u201cthe US stock market performed in line with the prevailing fundamentals of the time.\u201d (Citi Private Bank) More\n\nThe Nixon experience is notable because stocks took an unambiguous plunge. But as JPMorgan\u2019s John Normand noted in an August 2018 note to clients: \u201cThese were extraordinary times, however, with or without domestic politics. The Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was in the process of disintegrating due to US balance of payments stress and Nixon\u2019s decision to suspend the dollar\u2019s convertibility into gold \u2014 and devalue the currency \u2014 in 1971. Hence the dollar\u2019s erratic swings and gold\u2019s rally during this period. The First Oil Shock in late 1973 delivered both recession and rising inflation in 1974, and thus a stagflation-driven sell-off in Equities and Bonds.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there were other forces moving markets.\n\nThe Clinton experience is interesting as well because the stock market got slammed before the impeachment proceedings, as Normand notes, \u201cdue the previous months\u2019 traumas from the Asian Crisis, Russian default and LTCM collapse.\u201d From there, investors were too busy riding up the dot-com boom to be distracted by turmoil in D.C.\n\nThe takeaway is that each instance was very different and it\u2019s probably safe to say this time is different. But what\u2019s clear is that over time, the stock market has ultimately reflected what\u2019s been going on in the economy, not the White House.\n\n\u2014\n\nSam Ro is managing editor at Yahoo Finance.
