Anyone who knows me knows very well that I am not a racist.'\n\n'I went and looked up the word racist, just to see what the exact meaning of the word was ... and it is to look down on someone of a different race.\n\n'That's not what I said, and I certainly do not think I am better than anyone else.'\n\nHowever Stynes fired back on Saturday, saying Kennerley had not been exonerated by the ACMA finding.\n\nYumi Stynes has reignited the racist debate between her and Kerri-Anne Kennerley after lashing out at the popular TV host in a fiery tweet\n\nKennerley came under fire after she was labelled a 'racist' by Stynes during a heated argument about Australia Day in January\n\n'Don't be tricked by this headline,' she tweeted on Saturday, citing a Sydney Morning Herald report on the ACMA report.\n\n'ACMA didn't clear KAK (Kerri-Anne Kennerley). It cleared Channel 10. ACMA found that KAK's comments were based on RACE and were capable of \"generating strong negative feelings...\"\n\n'...this was mitigated (for Ch10, not KAK) precisely because someone was there to call it out.\n\n'I am sickened by the further gaslighting of indigenous people by this inaccurate and lazy reporting.'\n\nKennerley and Stynes confronted each other on air during a Studio 10 discussion about protests against Australia Day, with Kennerley saying indigenous protestors and their supporters should be more concerned with the dire state of many Aboriginal communities.\n\n\n\nStynes called out the article stating that it was Channel 10 that was cleared of any wrongdoing\n\nFollowing an investigation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Kennerley said she was happy that 'common sense prevailed' after the watchdog cleared her of any wrongdoing\n\n'The 5,000 people who went through the streets making their points known, saying how inappropriate the day is - has any single one of those people been out to the Outback, where children, babies, five-year-olds, are being raped?\n\n'Their mothers are being raped, their sisters are being raped. They get no education. What have you done?'\n\nAfter a pause, Stynes then attacked Kennerley's comments.\n\n'That is not even faintly true, Kerri-Anne. You're sounding quite racist right now,' she said.\n\nKennerley and Stynes both joined the Studio 10 panel during discussions over 'Invasion Day' protests earlier this year\n\nKennerley responded by stating she was offended, but Stynes doubled down on her insult.\n\n'Well keep going then, because every time you open your mouth you're sounding racist.'\n\nKennerley wasn't prepared to cede any ground, either, and again went after the protesters who she accused of only caring one day of the year.\n\n'These people are desperate for help. Aboriginal elder women are desperate for help, and they're not getting it.\n\n'Where are these people doing [other than] one day of the year? You'd be better off doing something positive.'\n\nWith the argument threatening to boil over, host Sarah Harris tried to defuse the situation.\n\n'Take it back a notch\u2026 everything's going to be cool,' she interjected.\n\nShe tried to say that it is an issue that really 'fires people up', but maintained 'everyone has their hearts in the right places and everyone wants to do the right thing'.\n\nStynes told Kennerley many of the protesters would have previously gone out into the Indigenous communities, but Kennerley demanded exact numbers\n\nStynes told Kennerley many of the protesters would have previously gone out into the Indigenous communities, but Kennerley demanded exact numbers.\n\nShe also claimed Kennerley was glossing over women and children also being raped in cities, stating it wasn't just a rural problem.\n\nKennerley insisted she wasn't racist just because she 'had a point of view', but Stynes objected to her making assumptions about 5,000 people.\n\n'Yeah, you're actually connecting rape, child abuse, you're drawing a straight line\u2026 and you're implying those 5000 protesters, none of whom you know personally, are all lazy and idle,' she said.\n\n'You're asking if any of them have ever done anything as though it's clear they haven't.'\n\nKennerley in turn accused her of 'drawing a line that isn't there', but Stynes said she 'saw it quite clearly'.\n\n'Well\u2026 get new glasses,' Kennerley snapped back as Yumi sat stony-faced and stared out at the audience.\n\nFollowing the conflict from her comments, Kennerley was invited to spend time with Indigenous women in the outback of Alice Springs.\n\nDuring her time there she spent several days with Shirleen Campbell and the Tangentyere Women's Family Safety Group, which she labelled a 'great experience'.\n\nStynes, whose mother is Japanese, campaigns on race and feminism issues along with being a broadcaster and writer.", "description": "Kerri-Anne Kennerley came under fire after she was labelled a 'racist' by Yumi Stynes during a heated argument about Australia Day in January.", "authors": ["Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/12/19331222-0-image-a-24_1570274972285.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
