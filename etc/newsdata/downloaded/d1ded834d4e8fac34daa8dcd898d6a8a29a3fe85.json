about 15 seconds to get to her feet but won the next two points to earn a crucial break for a 3-2 lead and then took a medical timeout so a trainer could look at her already-wrapped ankle.\n\nHer coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, later told reporters that Williams was not in too much discomfort.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem -- there is the video, but what is more important is how she feels and how the ankle looks. The ankle looks okay,\u201d said Mouratoglou.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel much pain. She feels, but it\u2019s acceptable. And we will know tomorrow when it\u2019s going to be cold.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who is seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title and her first since the 2017 Australian Open, will face China\u2019s Wang Qiang in the quarter-finals.\n\nReuters", "description": "Serena Williams charged into the US\u00a0Open quarter-finals on Sunday but it may have come at a price as the six-times champion suffered a right ankle injury.
