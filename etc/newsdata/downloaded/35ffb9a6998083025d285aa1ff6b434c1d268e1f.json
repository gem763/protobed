Tom Tingle, The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nMy son was killed by an illegal immigrant who was helped by the same open-borders philosophy Beto O'Rourke is pushing. That makes my blood boil.\n\nDemocrat presidential candidate Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O'Rourke's response to a legitimate question at a campaign rally offers a teaching moment on immigration \u2014 just not the sort that Beto intended.\n\nA woman at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally in Phoenix told Beto exactly what many reasonable people think about his push to end immigration enforcement and effectively open the border. She calmly and respectfully told O'Rourke that he was \u201cpandering,\u201d and that his policy proposals were a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to legal immigrants who sacrificed time, effort and money to follow the law.\n\nWhat was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s reaction? His response all but accused this woman of wanting to kill kids.\n\nBeto says immigrants 'pose no threat'\n\nForget about the slap in the face to legal immigrants. O'Rourke deemed it a slap in the face to \u201chis conscience\u201d that anybody would dare to question his desire to open the borders, launching into ridiculous talking points about \u201cchildren in cages.\"\n\nEven worse, he talked about the seven children who have died in immigration custody over the last few years \u2014 all of them tragic, none of them due to foul play on the part of Americans.\n\nPolicies have consequences: My son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die.\n\nIn case the implication of his response \u2014 that if you oppose illegal immigration, you like dead kids \u2014 wasn\u2019t clear enough, O'Rourke tweeted the exchange with the caption, \u201cImmigrants pose no threat to her. And we need to call people out for saying they do.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke could just as easily have been talking to me.\n\nAs the mother of a police officer killed by an illegal immigrant who was able to remain in America because of the same immigration philosophy O'Rourke is pushing, the way he treated this woman makes my blood boil.\n\nMy son was killed by an illegal immigrant\n\nMary Ann Mendoza wears a necklace with the face of her son, Brandon Mendoza, a Mesa officer who was killed by an undocumented wrong-way driver. (Photo: Megan Janetsky/Cronkite News)\n\nChallenged on his opposition to enforcing our immigration laws, O'Rourke talked about the tragic deaths of children whose parents forced them to make a dangerous, illegal journey through the desert.\n\nBut he ignored the fact that many, many more migrants die making that crossing than die accidentally in custody \u2014 as well as the fact that those children who did die in custody already faced life-threatening conditions when they were apprehended.\n\nThose deaths are actively encouraged by the open borders ideology, yet they aren\u2019t important to O'Rourke.\n\nStories from the border: The women asylum seekers I met need protection, not barriers\n\nMy son, Brandon Mendoza, was killed less than 30 miles from the spot where the candidate stood and berated that woman. An illegal immigrant \u2014 the kind that Beto scoffed \u201cposed no threat\u201d \u2014 slammed into my son\u2019s car as he drove home from his shift with the Mesa Police Department.\n\nThat illegal immigrant, who would not have been in our country if our laws were properly enforced, was drunk. He had alcohol in his blood at three times the legal limit. He was high on methamphetamine and driving the wrong way on the highway.\n\nWeak enforcement has consequences\n\nMy son\u2019s killer had multiple criminal convictions during his 20 years living illegally in America. Employing the same open borders rationale as O'Rourke, judges, policymakers and activists ensured that he was never deported.\n\nSince my son\u2019s death, I\u2019ve fought to change the policies that enabled it \u2014 to get our elected officials to secure the border and remove people who have no right to be here, especially convicted criminals.\n\nTurning on their own people?: I asked Latinos why they joined immigration law enforcement. Now I'm urging them to leave.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke has made it clear he wants the opposite. He wants us to believe that enforcing immigration law is tantamount to killing kids.\n\nThat\u2019s a slap in the face not just to legal immigrants, but to everyone who has suffered from the sort of weak immigration enforcement that O'Rourke desires.\n\nMary Ann Mendoza live in Arizona.
