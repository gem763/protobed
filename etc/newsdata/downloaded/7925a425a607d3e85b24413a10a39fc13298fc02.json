According to a report from the Hong Kong Free Press, the vehicle smashed into a storefront and injured at least one woman.\n\nProtests in Hong Kong have taken their darkest turn yet, with a taxi driver ploughing through a crowd of protesters who then turned on him. @renaehenry9 #9News pic.twitter.com/Gb0qQJXXaS \u2014 Nine News Australia (@9NewsAUS) October 7, 2019\n\nFollowing the crash, large crowds of protesters surrounded and attacked the taxi driver. Other protesters then shielded the driver from further beatings. Details of his condition remain unclear, although he was seen bleeding profusely from his head. Firefighters stepped in to give first aid to both the driver and the woman; the man was later taken to hospital for his injuries.\n\nHong Kong's political unrest took another dark turn Sunday when a driver mowed down protesters with a taxi cab and was beaten bloody by a mob. #9Newshttps://t.co/v7iEgRmF1J \u2014 Nine News Queensland (@9NewsQueensland) October 6, 2019\n\nThe vehicle was later found heavily vandalized, with its windows broken, license plate spray-painted, and the man\u2019s possessions scattered on the ground.\n\nSunday\u2019s protests were called in response to Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam\u2019s decision to ban face masks across the city, citing British colonial law. The ban applies to both \u201cillegal\u201d and police-approved demonstrations and carries penalties ranging from a fine to up to a year in jail. Nearly all of the demonstrators wore masks in defiance of the ban, making it effectively impossible for police to regulate.\n\n\u201c(Hong Kong leader) Carrie Lam is not the god of Hong Kong. She can\u2019t do anything she likes,\u201d retiree Patricia Anyeung told ABC Australia as she marched with her mask on. \u201cThey can\u2019t arrest us all. There are thousands of us. There is no going back \u2014 we are at the point of no return.\u201d\n\nThe protests took place throughout the weekend despite bad weather, roadblocks, and the closure of public transport.\n\nProtesters in Mong Kok appear to have made a catapult with bamboo scaffolding in order to launch bricks.

As of Monday afternoon, the boy was reportedly in a stable condition having suffered a gunshot wound to the leg.\n\nHong Kong has been subject to widespread political and civil unrest since early June when pro-democracy activists began taking to the streets to oppose an extradition bill that would have permitted criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0fProtesters remained on the streets of Hong Kong as night fell, Saturday, October 5, despite an increased police presence.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Hong Kong Lawmakers Seek to Block Mask Ban; Protests Persisthttps://t.co/QAyLtHVf9p pic.twitter.com/Zkhg4mbef1 \u2014 The Voice of America (@VOANews) October 6, 2019\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government has since scrapped the bill. Wider demonstrations continue to demand an investigation into police brutality, freedom for political prisoners, and the direct election of lawmakers.\n\nThe movement is part of an intense pushback against Beijing\u2019s increasing interference in the city\u2019s internal affairs, undermining the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d that was signed following the handover from the British Empire in 1997.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "A taxi driver reportedly rammed his vehicle into a crowd of protesters in\u00a0Hong Kong on Sunday, triggering a violent response.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hong-kong-china-protesters-democracy-2019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
