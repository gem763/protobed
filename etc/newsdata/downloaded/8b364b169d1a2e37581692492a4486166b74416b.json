Like poaching and animal brutality,\" he wrote in a note posted on his Instagram stories. \"Ur tripping because I want a specific kind of cat? U weren't tripping when I got my dog Oscar and he wasn't a rescue.\"\n\nBieber added that he believes \"in adopting rescues but also think there are preferences and that's what breeders are for.\"\n\n\"PETA go help with all the plastic in the ocean, and leave my beautiful cats alone,\" he ended his note.\n\nOn Friday, PETA responded to Bieber in another statement provided to CNN.\n\nPETA President Ingrid Newkirk said \"Sorry, Justin, but you must think more deeply about this issue: When millions of animals are losing their lives every year because not enough people adopt -- choosing instead to shop -- the animal overpopulation crisis is a 'real problem.'\"\n\n\"That's what 'sucks,'\" she said. \"PETA urges you to spend just one hour in a municipal animal shelter with us -- we think you'll understand how hard it is to look into the animals' eyes and know that because people pay breeders, many of them will pay with their lives. You have the power to be a great role model on this issue -- your behavior guides that of tons of your fans -- so please put that to good use.\"", "description": "Justin Bieber and PETA are engaged in a cat fight.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191004132130-justin-bieber-cats-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
