For the most part, the former White House Press Secretary turned memoirist, super-PAC spokesman and now controversial reality TV contestant\u2014who couldn\u2019t open his mouth during his calamitous six-month stint in the Trump Administration without sticking a foot in it\u2014let his costume do the talking. And it was loud. Clad in a shiny, ruffly, chest-baring chartreuse shirt, Spicer shimmied gamely into the show\u2019s Art-Deco-camp studio at the beginning of the episode. Though he spent the first hour and 45 minutes of the two-hour premiere hovering in the back of group shots, his face obscured but bits of his flammable-looking top glistening tackily under the lights, it was clear from the moment he made his entrance that Spicer would be playing the role of the good sport.\n\nAfter raising eyebrows last month by publicly lamenting a new executive producer\u2019s decision to book \u201cdivisive\u201d celebrities \u201cfrom ANY party affiliation,\u201d host Tom Bergeron kept any lingering frustration over Spicer\u2019s presence well concealed. And the rest of the cast followed suit. For her part, his dance partner Lindsay Arnold poked fun at his limited skills (\u201cHe definitely isn\u2019t a natural\u201d) but maintained that she was \u201clooking forward to forming [her] own opinion\u201d about Spicer as a person. He grinned his way through the judges\u2019 good-natured ribbing and gratefully praised Arnold for her attempts at whipping him into shape.\n\nThe show did\u2014briefly and cagily\u2014address the backlash to his casting in the rehearsal montage that preceded his debut performance, a salsa number set to the Spice Girls hit \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d that opened with the political operative pounding bongos and closed with him executing a knee slide that looked painful. Alongside clips of innocuous briefing room gaffes, Spicer admitted that his time in Washington was \u201ctumultuous,\u201d fretted that Americans had gotten a \u201cone-dimensional\u201d view of his personality and confessed that dancing in front of an audience of millions was even more intimidating than facing the media. Responding to a tweet in which Trump cheered Spicer\u2019s casting, Spicer basked awkwardly in the glow of his former boss\u2019s approval: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have the leader of the free world on your side.\u201d\n\nOn the whole, Spicer came off as humble and self-aware but far from contrite\u2014a triumph of image rehab without accountability. His success is more than a little infuriating when you remember\u2014though of course he would prefer that you forgot\u2014that the original controversy surrounding him wasn\u2019t just partisan noise. The problem with a primetime dance competition giving Spicer a platform to burnish his reputation isn\u2019t that he holds conservative views; it\u2019s that he helped normalize practices, from his invention and repetition of obvious falsehoods to his antagonistic relationship with the press, that were previously beyond the pale for American politics. When Spicer appeared on the Emmys in 2017, just a few months after leaving the White House, former Obama Administration speechwriter David Litt called his comeback \u201can I\u2019m-getting-away-with-it-right-now-because-I-let-the-American-people-down-and-you\u2019re-applauding-me-for-it tour.\u201d Two years later, that tour rolls on.\n\nBergeron needn\u2019t have worried that the former press secretary would inject Republican talking points into DWTS or do anything else to jeopardize what the host described as a \u201cjoyful respite from our exhausting political climate.\u201d (Personally, I would describe the experience of sitting through the two-hour broadcast as more \u201cexcruciating\u201d than \u201cjoyful.\u201d) The danger in casting Spicer isn\u2019t that he could politicize the show; it\u2019s that, with each episode, the show will help to de-politicize Spicer. The more we watch him ham it up in funny costumes, the more we\u2019ll forget what he did. The shameful details of his legacy will fade from our collective memory, merging into an undifferentiated mass of late-2010s cultural curiosities. Once, he was the press secretary notorious for practicing casual Holocaust denial, justifying the President\u2019s position on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with the absurd claim that Adolf Hitler \u201cdidn\u2019t even sink to using chemical weapons\u201d against his own people. Now\u2014like cast mates James Van Der Beek, Karamo from Queer Eye and Supremes legend Mary Wilson\u2014we know him simply as a \u201cstar.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The danger in casting Spicer isn't that he could politicize the show; it's that the show will help to de-politicize Spicer.", "authors": ["Judy Berman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/153328_em1_3087.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
