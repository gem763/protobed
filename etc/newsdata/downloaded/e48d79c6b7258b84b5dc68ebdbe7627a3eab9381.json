That should be a special imperative in this litigation, which is so much in the public eye.\"\n\nThe companies include retailers CVS Health Corp, Rite Aid Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Walmart Inc, and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp , Cardinal Health Inc, Henry Schein Inc and McKesson Corp.\n\nTheir disqualification request, originally made directly to Polster on Sept. 14, followed several rulings against them.\n\nLegal experts have called the effort to remove Polster a long shot, saying it is common for judges to encourage settlements and that disqualifications are rare.\n\nOhio, 13 other states and Washington, D.C. have separately asked the appeals court to halt the upcoming trial, saying it undermines their right to litigate on their own.\n\nOpioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
