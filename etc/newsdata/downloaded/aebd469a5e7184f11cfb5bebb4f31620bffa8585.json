And for some, that translates into an almost religious devotion to the team they support.\n\nTake for instance, Saskatchewan Roughriders fans.\n\nOver a century old, the football team has won four Grey Cup Championships and amassed innumerable fans from countries across the world.\n\nOne megafan Lance Hackewich , has an entire shrine dedicated to the Roughriders his Regina home.\n\nFrom helmets to signed cleats to a suite of novelty items that could easily rival any gift shop, he takes his devotion to the team very seriously.\n\nAnother Riders superfan loved the team so much, he had their symbol tattooed onto his prosthetic eye .\n\nIn 2009, Rider Nation even caused a surge in demand for watermelons in Calgary, when they descended on the city for a Grey Cup game.\n\nThe fruity \"helmets\" are an essential part of Roughriders culture.\n\nSaskatchewan Roughriders fans can usually be found wearing their traditional watermelon \"helmets\". (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Thornhill)\n\nAnd this doesn't just happen in Saskatchewan. From Mexico to Australia , fans have been seen showcasing their Rider pride in stadiums across the world.\n\nAnd according to Chris Hrynkow, professor of religion at Saint Thomas More College in Saskatoon, this kind of devoutness to sports fandom can be explained by what's known as \"civil religion.\"\n\nHere, he is referring to the parts of our daily lives that can be likened to a religion, or the idea of bringing people together through shared beliefs, experiences and rituals.\n\nAnd just like a religion with weekly services, sports fans have recurring opportunities to express their devotion throughout a season.\n\nHrynkow said there are a number of other ways that being a sports fan can become kind of a religion.\n\nDevotion\n\nAfter moving to Saskatchewan in 2011, Hrynkow said he was struck by the values that are often attached to being a 'Rider's fan.\n\n\"One of the greatest Saskatchewan historians, talks about how during the Depression, people had real faith in the land, even though it wasn't producing well. [They believed] that it would come back and it would still be bountiful and give them a harvest,\" Hrynkow explained.\n\nHe said Roughriders fans regard their team with a similar optimism.\n\nJust like the farmers who believed in the land despite poor harvests, Riders fans maintain their faith during the years their team does badly, \"and then [have] these sort of moments of deliverance of redemption when they do well,\" he said.\n\nA far cry from his early years living in Montreal, Hrynkow says he was struck by how much the Riders fans seem to draw positive energy when their team does well, but still stick with them when they do poorly.\n\nAfter losing a Grey Cup game, a crowd of cheering Riders fans welcomed the team at Mosaic Stadium. ((Troy Fleece/Canadian Press))\n\nEvangelizing\n\nHrynkow says sports fandom is also similar to religion in the way that sports fans try to bring people into the fold.\n\nSaint Thomas More College, where Hrynkow works, recently sponsored a Syrian refugee who is Muslim.\n\n\"When we were setting him up, [a lot of people] gave him Riders gear as sort of a way to welcome him to the province,\" he said.\n\n\"It's kind of like evangelizing in that way.\"\n\nAnd, as he points out, even the Catholic community who sponsored him were more concerned about what CFL team he was going to support than where he'd be worshipping.\n\n\"No one would say, you know, we really want you to become Catholic, but I think they really wanted him to become a Riders fan.\"\n\nStadium as holy site or temple\n\nHrynkow says some stadiums and sports arenas can become ad hoc holy sites.\n\n\"The classic example where I grew up in Montreal would be like the Montreal Forum , and that was a place of pilgrimage,\" he said. \"[As] schoolchildren you're brought there, you're told the history.\"\n\nFor the Roughriders, that holy site is the Mosaic Stadium in Regina. The 33,000-seater is an open-air stadium that the Riders call home.\n\nPilgrimage\n\nIf the stadium is a holy site, then it follows that the trek to get there can become something of a pilgrimage.\n\n\"[It's] the idea of people making the effort to go to the place [just] to have that experience,\" he said.\n\nAnd that assumption is right, especially when you consider the lengths that many sports fans will go to to make sure they get to see their favorite team in the flesh.\n\n\"Here in Saskatchewan, people come from all around the province, and even expatriates come from further afield to go to Regina to see the Riders play.\"\n\nRituals\n\nMany athletes practice rituals that they hope will either motivate them or give them some kind of luck in the game.\n\n\"They feel if they don't practice those rituals properly before they enter the ice, or enter the arena, then their game might go poorly,\" Hrynkow said.\n\nBut it's not just athletes who have rituals, Hrynkow said. The fans do too.\n\n\"[They] seem to believe also that certain actions that they do can affect the outcome of the actual sporting event, which is kind of interesting,\" he said.\n\nWatermelon helmet anyone?", "description": "Over the years, the Saskatchewan Roughriders have built one of the most loyal and devoted fan bases in the CFL.
