(Shelley Joyce/CBC)\n\nPapais says she is especially excited by the new mosaic because it took many years to create all the drawings seen in the piece, and years to process all the ideas brought forward by Ashcroft's Japanese community.\n\n\"I found out that these people are gracious beautiful people that \u2060\u2014 as it says on the piece written in their Japanese characters \u2060\u2014 in the spirit of generosity can forgive going forward,\" Papais told Shelley Joyce, host of Daybreak Kamloops.\n\nArt in retirement\n\nPapais and Collett moved to Ashcroft 12 years ago to retire. But retirement has been busy for the couple, as they treat making free glass art for the community as a full time job \u2060\u2014 working out of the Ashcroft HUB community centre.\n\n\"We do it because we want to allow other people in our community to have a full voice on the things that are important to them,\" said Papais.\n\n\"I do it because I know it will live well beyond me. And it's a statement. It's something I can leave as a legacy to my grandchildren and to all the people that I love.\"\n\nArtist Marina Papais cuts glass in her Ashcroft workspace. (Shelley Joyce/CBC)\n\nShe says glass can last well beyond paintings, and the materials she uses are weather and winter resistant, making her pieces well-suited for the streets of Ashcroft.\n\n\"The translucency of glass is spectacular. I love the way the sun plays on glass. It's always moving and living and it's always talking to you.\"\n\n50 public art installations and counting\n\nPrior to retiring, Collett was a construction teacher and carpenter. He builds all the framework for Papais' mosaic pieces and helps her place the glass.\n\nOne of Marina Papais and Daniel Collett's public pieces of mosaic art in Ashcroft, B.C. (Shelley Joyce/CBC)\n\nOver 50 of the large glass art pieces can be found in Ashcroft, and the community decides where to place them. \u200bCollett estimates one mosaic piece takes between 450 to 600 hours to make.\n\nPrior to the Japanese internment piece, the duo worked with the Ashcroft Indian Band for five months to create a public mosaic as well.\n\n\"I'm sure all communities are beautiful. But Ashcroft is a really special community, so I do it because I love this community,\" said Papais.\n\nThe mosaic Marina Papais made in collaboration with the Ashcroft Indian Band.
