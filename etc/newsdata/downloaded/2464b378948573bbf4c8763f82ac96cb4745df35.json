They were part of an ongoing initiative to commemorate the day Brexit is finalised that was first pitched by former chancellor Philip Hammond during his time in No 11.\n\nHowever HM Treasury has confirmed the approximately 3 million coins would be recycled now that the EU has agreed a Brexit extension of 31 January with the UK Government.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\"We will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the European Union, and this will enter circulation after we have left,\" a spokesman said.\n\nThe dates on the coin may continue to change but the text \u2013 Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations \u2013 has remained constant.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
