Speaking to an audience of 100 black women, Cooper said, \u201cI hate when people talk about black women being obese. I hate it, because it becomes a way to blame us for a set of conditions that we didn\u2019t create. We are living in the Trump era. And look, those policies kill our people. You can\u2019t get access to good health care, good insurance.\u201d\n\nShe told the group that when black women follow the same diet as white women, \u201cwe lose less weight and we lose it slower.\u201d According to Cooper, \u201cpublic health practitioners think that our stress responses in the body change our metabolism.\u201d\n\nDrumroll, please. Wait for it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally that the racism you are experiencing and the struggle to make ends meet actually means the diet don\u2019t work for you the same.\u201d\n\nThe women in the audience all nod in agreement.\n\nLeading the panel was a very fit young black woman. My heart rose for a moment when she said, \u201cIt\u2019s also important for us to note that we have the power,\u201d but fell when she completed her sentence with \u201cto choose how we see ourselves.\u201d What?\n\nShe continued \u201cWe will be fortified to fight all of these external issues when we pour into ourselves enough to say, \u2018I love me. I\u2019m not the conditions that surround me. I am not my experience. I am more than the circumstances I have gone through.\u201d\n\nTo say that Trump\u2019s policies are responsible for the obesity of black women is, obviously, ridiculous. I searched the internet for any year-over-year comparisons to see if obesity has increased over the last three years among this demographic, but was unable to find any up-to-date studies.\n\nStudies do show that obesity is disproportionately higher for black women than any other group. Four out of five are considered to be obese. And obesity rates have increased in the U.S. overall in the past two decades.\n\nBut these women are preaching a victim mentality. It is self-defeating and it is dangerous. How about instead of telling these women \u201cIt\u2019s also important for us to note that we have the power to choose how we see ourselves,\u201d you tell them \u2018it\u2019s also important for us to note that we have the power to choose what we put into our mouths, to go out for a walk once a day or to go to the gym.\u2019\n\nTo blame obesity on race is self-defeating. To blame obesity on President Trump\u2019s policies is insane.\n\nThe U.S. economy is the healthiest it\u2019s been in years. The unemployment rate, both overall and among blacks, is the lowest it\u2019s been in half a century. I doubt very much that economic pressure among blacks has increased in the last three years.\n\nPutting aside any Trump connections, instead of giving these young women excuses for their obesity, thereby perpetuating the cycle, why not tell them it doesn\u2019t have to remain this way?\n\nI know. We are living in the era of Trump. And everyone is a victim.\n\n\u201cI hate when people talk about Black women being obese. I hate it, because it becomes a way to blame us for a set of conditions that we didn\u2019t create.\u201d \u2013 @ProfessorCrunk.
