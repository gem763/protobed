The outburst was intended for 10-year-old fraternal quadruplet brothers, who have achieved notoriety for posting music to their ZN8tion Instagram account, which boasts over 143,000 followers. Two weeks ago, the Westchester, New York natives \u2014 who go by the names Hollywood, Slim Z, Bonez McKoy and Mr. Great \u2014 posted a scathing diss-track against Cardi, saying she\u2019s \u201cwashed up,\u201d \u201cbelongs in a zoo,\u201d and smells like a \u201cturd,\u201d among other schoolyard insults.\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic More\n\nRELATED: Cardi B Isn\u2019t Embarrassed by Anything She\u2019s Done \u2014 Not Her Stripper Past Nor Her Nicki Minaj Feud\n\nThe taunts continued with chants of \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s faker: your life or your butt.\u201d To illustrate this point, one of the quartet accentuates his bottom by shoving a pillow down his pants before busting a move.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Cardi B Claps Back at Jermaine Dupri for Calling Today\u2019s Female Hip Hop Stars \u2018Strippers Rapping\u2019\n\nThe kids don\u2019t seem particularly upset by Cardi\u2019s response. In fact, they posted a capture of the 26-year-old\u2019s rant to YouTube (NSFW, obviously), and included the link in their Instagram bio for all to see.\n\nIn an interview with Page Six, the brother known as \u201cHollywood\u201d claimed that they targeted Cardi because \u201cshe\u2019s been a bully\u201d to other artists over the course of her career. \u201cWe wanted to show Cardi B to not be a bully and give her a taste of her own medicine.\u201d", "description": "Cardi B Slams 10-Year-Olds for Posting Diss Track", "authors": ["Jordan Runtagh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U.WJ6bgl0sCyQTgOR_s4MQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/5927fb88028b5892afd909698571f287"}
