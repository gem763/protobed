REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File Photo\n\nAsia\u2019s third largest economy expanded just 5.0% year on year, official data showed on Friday, far below the 5.7% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists - and analysts believe the slowdown could persist for two or three years while much needed structural reforms are put in place.\n\nIn its annual report on Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said a big push on infrastructure spending would be needed to revive consumer demand and private investment.\n\nStructural reforms - covering labour laws, taxation and the legal system - were also required to ease the path for businesses in India, it said.\n\nThe RBI has cut its benchmark repo rate by 110 basis points so far this year, and a further cut of at least 25 points at its next monetary policy committee meeting in October now appears on the cards.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy grew 8% in the same quarter of 2018, and 5.8% in the previous quarter.\n\nMadhavi Arora, lead economist at Edelweiss Securities in Mumbai, said the economy appeared to have lost momentum.\n\n\u201cThe growth slump clearly reflects that the slowdown is beyond just the cyclical aspects and policymakers need to address the structural constraints to ensure ...growth picks up ahead,\u201d Arora said.\n\nWith inflation having run below the RBI\u2019s 4% medium-term target in the year to July 2019, it has shown willingness to join hands with the government in trying to provide stimulus.\n\nKrishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economic adviser at the Ministry of Finance, said the government was \u201ctaking all the necessary steps\u201d to quickly put the economy back on a high-growth path.\n\nOn Friday, the government announced mergers involving ten state-owned banks in a bid to strengthen a banking sector struggling under a mountain of bad debt, and to boost lending.\n\nThis week it also approved 100% foreign investment in coal mining and eased rules in the contract manufacturing and single-brand retail sectors.\n\nBROAD-BASED SLOWDOWN?\n\nSigns of slowing demand and investment are widespread.\n\nMany indicators \u2013 automobile sales, rail freight, petroleum product consumption, domestic air traffic and imports - are signalling drops in domestic consumption.\n\nIn July, auto sales tumbled 31% from a year earlier, the biggest decline in nearly two decades, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nIn the June quarter, private investment grew 3.1%, down from 7.2% in the previous quarter, while government spending growth slowed to 8.8% from 13.1%.\n\nCapital investment picked up to 4.0% from 3.6%, indicating rise in lending by banks, while agriculture grew modestly and manufacturing edged up just 0.6%.\n\nWorkers erect scaffolding at a construction site of a metro rail station in Kolkata, India, July 5, 2019.

Finance ministry officials said this provided room for \u201cmodest stimulus\u201d despite pressure to contain the fiscal deficit.\n\nSakshi Gupta, Senior economist at HDFC Bank, said policy stimulus from both the RBI and the government, along with a near-normal monsoon, could provide some economic relief in the second half.\n\n\u201cGoing ahead, we are looking at activity improving from these lows.
