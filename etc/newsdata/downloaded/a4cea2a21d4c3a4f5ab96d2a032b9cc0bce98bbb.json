The pound was yanked down to $1.2850 from $1.30 GBP= after UK lawmakers put the brakes on the government's Brexit plans again on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe\u2019s tech sector .SX8P fell as much as 1.4% as STMicroelectronics (STM.MI), Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) and Infineon (IFXGn.DE) all dropped after Texas Instruments slumped 10% (TXN.O) in after-hours Wall Street trading.[.EU]\n\nMajor Asian chipmakers, including Taiwan\u2019s TSMC (2330.TW) and South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix (000660.KS), had fallen overnight too on worries the industry was being squeezed both by a downturn in global demand and by the U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\u201cWhen there are tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious. And they pull back,\u201d Rafael Lizardi, Texas Instruments\u2019 chief financial officer, said after the company\u2019s results.\n\nWith investors seeking out safer assets again, the Japanese yen climbed to a one-week high of 108.25 per dollar JPY= and the Swiss franc CHF= gained early in Europe.\n\nAdam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said Brexit was driving a \u201cgeneral risk-off tone.\u201d Others pointed to the growing likelihood British Prime Minister Boris Johnson would now push for a snap election.\n\n\u201cThings could change very quickly today, depending on the EU response,\u201d Cole said, referring to how much EU leaders would be prepared to extend the Brexit deadline beyond Oct. 31.\n\nBut he added he didn\u2019t see \u201cmuch downside\u201d risk for sterling now, with a no-deal Brexit off the table.\n\nThe pound has surged 4.5% this month which, if it holds the gains, will be its best month since January last year.\n\nReceding worries about a no-deal Brexit also underpinned the euro at $1.1122 EUR=, just below a two-month high of $1.1180, though it was also down to the dollar staying subdued before an expected third U.S. interest rate cut of the year next week.\n\nIn a mirror image of the pound and euro, October is on course to see the biggest monthly fall in the dollar index .DXY since January 2018. It has only fallen for six of the months during that period too.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A trader works as a screen shows market data behind him at CMC markets in London, Britain, December 11, 2018.

Hopes for forgetting Texas\u2019 woes were already dashed as digger giant Caterpillar (CAT.N) blamed a weak global construction market as it cut its profit forecast after a hefty 13.5% fall in third quarter profits.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices fell after data showed U.S. crude inventories grew more than expected last week. But prices generally held firm after China signaled hopes for progress in upcoming trade talks with the United States and OPEC and its allies considered deeper cuts in production.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 0.52% to $59.39 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 lost 0.81% to $54.04 per barrel.", "description": "World stock markets struggled on Wednesday, as hopes faded that a Brexit deal would be wrapped by next week and a profit warning from Texas Instruments pulled down technology shares.", "authors": ["Marc Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444052277&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0ND", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
