For every MCG or Lambeau Field that staunchly retains and protects their historic title, there\u2019s a shiny new Smoothie King Centre or 1300SMILES Stadium that totally sells it down the river. It\u2019s an utterly ridiculous concept, so the best we could ever hope for is for some company with more money than they know what to do with ponying up the cash to do something outrageous and wonderful. Enter, the current bidding war for naming rights to a major NBA arena, and the porn company BangBros.\n\nThe story goes the NBA\u2019s Miami Heat and their home city council are in the process of looking for a new corporate sponsor for their arena, after previous holders American Airlines revealed they would not be renewing their sponsorship after this year.\n\nAs you\u2019d imagine, naming rights to a major NBA arena is a lucrative business, so the competition to nab them has been reasonably fierce.\n\nBangBros, which happens to be based in Miami, has officially put their hand \u2013 and probably other bodily parts \u2013 up for consideration this morning, submitting an extremely real $10 million bid that, if successful, would see the arena renamed the BangBros Centre for the next 10 years.\n\nOr, the BBC.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be British to know they\u2019re not referring to a TV station with that one.\n\nWe've officially Submitted our $10,000,000 bid for the naming rights to the Miami Heat Arena. We wish to thank American Airlines for their past support of the @MiamiHEAT We intend to change the name to the BangBros Center aka 'The BBC' #BangBrosCares pic.twitter.com/YbhNattIm7 \u2014 BANGBROSOFFICIAL (@BangBrosDotCom1) September 12, 2019\n\nThe proposal includes an artist\u2019s mock-up of what the arena would look like under the watchful eye of a porn company, complete with giant horny bus on the ceiling and a big-ass sign (not, we stress, a big ass sign) out front.\n\nThey\u2019ve even put together a website for the bid, which if you can even believe it, is 100% clean and safe for work.\n\nWe\u2019re not kidding. Click on it. The only thing close to a dirty joke in there is a Pitbull reference.\n\nWhile it would kick indescribable ass to have a porn company sponsor a major American arena, the outcome looks a little bleak for the BangBros and their beloved bus.\n\nAmerican Airlines was paying around $2 million per year to maintain the naming rights to the arena, and reports suggest the potential winning bid would be paying somewhere around $6 million per year for that privilege. So a $1 million-per-year contract over the span of a decade isn\u2019t likely to get the deal done.\n\nHonestly, they should put all $10 million in one basket for a single-year deal. The joke doesn\u2019t get outlived that way, and you\u2019re still getting \u2013 pun very intended \u2013 bang for your buck as far as \u2013 again, intended \u2013 exposure goes.\n\n\u2018Course a decade deal allows time for the team to get good again, meaning an NBA Championship banner wouldn\u2019t be the only thing being hung in there.\n\nYa gotta laugh, folks.", "description": "BangBros - yes, the porn site - has made a very real, very serious, $10 million bid for the naming rights to the Miami Heat's home arena.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/bangbros-centre-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
