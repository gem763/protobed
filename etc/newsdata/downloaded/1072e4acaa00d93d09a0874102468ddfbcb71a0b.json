Roberts\u2019 character self-indulges for the sake of self-indulging to a legendary scale, but perhaps such a feat has made this watchable in a rubbernecking sort of way.\n\nNetflix also adds an Original with the teen-centric \u201cTall Girl.\u201d You can read more about all three movies below.\n\nAnd if you want to stay informed of everything joining Netflix on a weekly basis, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HuffPost\n\nNotable Movies\n\n\u201cEat Pray Love\u201d \u2015 Sept. 10\n\nColumbia Pictures Julia Roberts in \"Eat Pray Love.\"\n\nDetails: This adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s 2006 memoir of the same name tells the story of a recently divorced woman who leaves her New York City life to travel to Italy, India and Indonesia in search of a renewed lust for life. Through caring less about the American dream of success and opening her heart to carbs, spirituality and unexpected romance, this woman feels as if she can transform into a happier person.\n\nJulia Roberts stars as the eater, prayer and lover. The cast also includes Javier Bardem, Billy Crudup, Viola Davis, James Franco and Richard Jenkins. Ryan Murphy co-wrote and directed the movie.\n\n\u201cEat Pray Love\u201d runs 2 hours, 13 minutes.\n\nRead on: Critics didn\u2019t like this movie, and backlash to the plot put somewhat of an end to the storytelling trope of having rich white people travel to \u201cexotic\u201d locales to find themselves through personal indulgence. (See also Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited\u201d from a few years earlier.) Here\u2019s how critic David Denby began his review of \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d in The New Yorker:\n\n\u201cEat Pray Love,\u201d in which Julia Roberts plays the writer Elizabeth Gilbert \u2014 a divorc\u00e9e looking for truth in highly photogenic locales \u2014 dribbles on for an eternity, sometimes intelligently and companionably, sometimes vacuously.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cTurbo\u201d \u2015 Sept. 12\n\nDreamworks The titular character of \"Turbo.\"\n\nDetails: A snail living in Los Angeles dreams of being fast, despite the limitations of his mollusk body. A moment of extreme wish fulfillment occurs as a Chevy Camaro sucks the snail into its nitrous oxide tank, which fuses the car with the snail\u2019s DNA. And so, obviously, the snail becomes super fast. But this new speed also brings new problems.\n\nRyan Reynolds voices the titular racing snail. The large voice cast also includes Snoop Dogg, Paul Giamatti, Bill Hader, Samuel L. Jackson, Ken Jeong, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Michelle Rodriguez, Maya Rudolph and Ben Schwartz.\n\n\u201cTurbo\u201d runs 1 hour, 36 minutes.\n\nRead on: DreamWorks Animation had to make a $13.5 million write-down on the movie despite \u201cTurbo\u201d earning around $280 million in the global box office. This snail movie almost created an existential catastrophe for DreamWorks, as the movie\u2019s monetary failure contributed to a class-action lawsuit. Here\u2019s how Bomb Report described the incident:\n\nThe box office failure of \u201cTurbo\u201d triggered a class action lawsuit from DreamWorks Animation shareholders against the company in 2013. During the 2013 second quarter earnings call CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg said \u201cbased on the data that we have to date, we do believe that \u2018Turbo\u2019 will be a profitable film.\u201d In the 2013 fourth quarter filing, DreamWorks animation posted the write-down and the lawsuit quickly followed. Shareholders claimed that DreamWorks delayed the write-down to artificially inflate the stock price by announcing \u201cTurbo\u201d would be profitable, knowing it would never get out of the red \u2014 even after ancillary sales. This led to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a year later the court sided with DreamWorks. Shareholders appealed three years later in February 2017 and the court upheld the ruling.\n\nMuch ado about a snail that goes fast voiced by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nTrailer:\n\nScott Saltzman/Netflix \"Tall Girl\" on Netflix.\n\nDetails: Jodi is a 16-year-old high school girl who has already grown to a height of 6 feet, 1.5 inches, making her the \u201ctall girl\u201d in school. Classmates call her \u201ctall girl\u201d to tease her, while friends try to convince Jodi to embrace her uniqueness. Jodi wants to date someone taller than her, so when a hot and tall boy arrives as a new student, Jodi has a reason to figure out how to use what she has to get what she wants. As expected, this quixotic journey of love helps her mature and question the desire to date someone taller than herself in the first place.\n\nThis stars mostly up-and-coming actors. Angela Kinsey (from \u201cThe Office\u201d) and Steve Zahn (from many movies) also appear.\n\n\u201cTall Girl\u201d runs 1 hour, 41 minutes.\n\nRead on: Madeleine Aggeler recently wrote a story for The Cut titled \u201cIt Was a Tall Girl Summer\u201d \u2015 a play on Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s hit song \u201cHot Girl Summer.\u201d Tied to the trailer debut of \u201cTall Girl,\u201d the piece celebrated various \u201ctall girls\u201d from this summer including Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Brienne of Tarth. The piece repeatedly refers to the protagonist of the Netflix movie as \u201cJordi\u201d in either a mistake or a joke that\u2019s beyond me, but here\u2019s an excerpt from the otherwise wonderful piece:\n\nAlthough Labor Day marks the unofficial end of the season, Tall Girl Summer isn\u2019t technically over yet. There are still a few weeks to embrace one\u2019s tallness, regardless of your height \u2014 to literally or figuratively look down on those around you, to go to concerts and be like, \u201cAhh, sorry, can you see?\u201d\n\nTrailer:\n\nThe Full List of Movies Joining Netflix\n\nSept. 9\n\n\u201cNorm of the North: King Sized Adventure\u201d\n\nSept. 10\n\n\u201cEat Pray Love\u201d\n\nSept. 12\n\n\u201cTurbo\u201d\n\nSept. 13\n\n\u201cHead Count\u201d\n\n\u201cTall Girl\u201d (Netflix Film)\n\nSept. 14", "description": "An infamous Julia Roberts rom-com joins the service.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76b26f240000822677c8e4.jpeg?cache=lPzSqw7b3F&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
