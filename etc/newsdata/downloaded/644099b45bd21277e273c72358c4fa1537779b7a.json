But the fight for freedom and a better world continues\n\nIn 1942, aged 18, my mother was running for her life with her father, mother and siblings, heading for an air-raid shelter as bombs pulverised Portsmouth, turning the city into \u201ca tomb of darkness\u201d as one diarist recorded. During the war the family were to lose their home twice as the city and its docks became a prime target. My mother was wearing a new coat so when her father ordered everyone to hit the ground, she refused. A bomb splinter gouged one side of her back. A female ambulance driver risked her life to drive my mother to hospital through the raid.\n\nI was born in 1948. My mother and father lived in a bedsit and saved a few shillings a week for her confinement. And then, like millions who had endured six years of war, they had their just rewards. \u201cThe destruction is so awful and the people so wonderful, they deserve a better world,\u201d wrote the future Queen Elizabeth to her grandmother, Mary. On 5 July, the NHS was born. It no longer cost a couple dearly to have a baby. I came along a few weeks later, a citizen of the new \u201ccradle to the grave\u201d welfare state. As historian Asa Briggs said: \u201cWar has necessitated welfare.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New mothers received home visits from nurses after the NHS was founded in 1948.

Clothes were still \u2018austerity\u2019, from the war dismal and ugly,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEveryone was indoors by 10 and the streets were empty\u2026 Any conversation tended to drift towards the war like an animal licking a sore place. There was a wariness, a weariness.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers, like me, were born out of \u2013 or because of \u2013 that weariness. We now make up one in five of the population (more than 12 million). This huge postwar bulge, \u201cthe pig in the python\u201d, created by those born in the years between 1944-64, is a permanent irritation to many not least because we are accused of making off with the spoils (one in five is a millionaire while 16% of the UK population lives in relative poverty). Eighty years since the second world war began and 74 years since it ended, we are now moving into our seventies.\n\nAt 18 I was part of the so-called swinging 60s, miniskirts, women's lib and the counter culture\n\nTime is running out to reconsider how war shaped not only the lives of our parents but our lives too. At 18, I was part of the so-called swinging 60s, sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll, miniskirts, Beatles, sit-ins, women\u2019s lib, protest, anti-establishment \u2013 the counter-culture. (The counter-culture combined with consumerism, described by American academic Theodore Roszak as \u201ca resounding market success\u201d).\n\nThanks to the expansion in higher education, in 1967, I was about to go to a redbrick university, on a full grant and paying no tuition fees. My mother had left school at 14 and became a tailor\u2019s apprentice and, to me, in 1967, she was a lost cause, entombed in domesticity. Then, the arrogance of youth meant she and I belonged to alien (and sometimes hostile) tribes. Only years later did I come to realise how much we had in common: how the experience of war had shaped my aspirations and frustrations and my generation\u2019s rejection of the notions that women and the working class should know their place \u2013 just as surely as it had shaped hers.\n\n\u201cBritish women have proved themselves in this war\u2026 they have died at their gun posts,\u201d instructed a US war department booklet given to every soldier entering Britain, equipped with supplies of nylon stockings, fags and chocolate. \u201cWhen you see a girl in uniform with a bit of ribbon on her tunic, remember she didn\u2019t get it for knitting more socks than anyone else in Ipswich.\u201d War, for women in Britain, broke down traditional barriers between the public and the private, the domestic and the \u201creal\u201d world. Women showed guts.\n\nOnly in Britain, from 1941, were so many women conscripted; the cage door had opened. In 1939, 5.1 million females were in work. Four years later, that number had swollen to 7.25 million \u2013 nine in 10 single women and eight in 10 wives had a wage packet. Even earlier, my mum had become one of the 2,000 women a week who enlisted, in her case in the newly established Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force. Posted to Yorkshire, she left her father\u2019s house as \u201ca mobile woman\u201d, independent, for the very first time. Much to the consternation of the trade unions, women took over what had previously been regarded as out of bounds for \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d, highly skilled \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d, including 300,000 jobs in the explosives and chemical industries and half a million posts in the engineering and metal industries. John G Winant, US ambassador to London, said: \u201cThis war, more than any other war in history, is a woman\u2019s war.\u201d\n\nWorking-class women had always needed to work but before the war more than a million had been employed as \u201cdomestics\u201d. Now they were in the male labour force. Mona Marshall, a nursemaid turned steelworker, said: \u201cThe war made me stand on my own two feet.\u201d Ellen McCulloch, a women\u2019s officer at the TGWU, said in 1942 of her members: \u201cThey began to realise that they weren\u2019t second-class citizens.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Secondary modern schools, like this one in Sheffield in 1960, offered new educational opportunities for working-class children.

In 1943, in the Rolls-Royce factory in Hillington near Glasgow, women went on strike. They earned 43 shillings a week, the men 30 shillings more. Backed by the men, they won \u2013 wages were paid according to the job, not gender.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to confront a common condition before you have recognised it,\u201d feminist Sheila Rowbotham was to write in 1973, about women waking up to the position they were in. \u201cYou can\u2019t begin to find your own power until you have consciously recognised your non-power.\u201d\n\nWar and national reconstruction meant women had been let out of the home but only on temporary licence to fulfil \u201cmasculine\u201d duties. But once out, some at least began to perceive that the problems they faced weren\u2019t down to their \u201cnatural\u201d inferiority but the system itself. That awareness set off ripples that created a tidal wave in the sixties.\n\nDislocation is a theme of all wars. In Britain in the second world war, mothers left home for work; men went to the front; children in London were evacuated. \u201cThey call this spring, mum,\u201d one child wrote to his mother from the countryside, \u201cand they have one down here every year.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yvonne Roberts and father John, May 1949.\n\nIn the sixties, we chanted \u201cMake Love Not War\u201d. In the war, they were making love. The number of illegitimate babies tripled to 16.1 per thousand in 1945. War forced men, women and children out of their comfort zone \u2013 gender, geography (between 1939-45 there were almost 35m changes of addresses in England and Wales) and class contributed to a kaleidoscope of new experiences and nobody knew where the pattern would settle \u2013 except that it had to be better than the squalor, poverty and social injustice that had prevailed before the war.\n\nThen came the Valium of the fifties when the position of women appeared to regress. They were told to go back home; nurseries were closed. But something had irreversibly changed. Women were carving out a different existence and so too, willingly or not, did the two million men returning from the forces.\n\n\u201cIn place of the traditional working-class husband as mean with his money as he was callous in sex, forcing unwanted babies on his wife, has come a man who wheels the pram on Saturday morning,\u201d wrote Michael Young and Peter Wilmott, egging the pudding a touch, in their study of London\u2019s Bethnal Green.\n\nWages rose (as did inflation), hire purchase \u2013 \u201cthe never-never\u201d \u2013 arrived and ensured that \u201ca \u2018care free kitchen\u2019, was awash with products to keep \u2018the little lady\u2019 amused\u201d. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958\u2019s The Affluent Society described what we now have again, \u201cprivate affluence, public squalor\u201d. In Britain the Conservatives built houses but also created new estates that were deserts not neighbourhoods.\n\nAs we lived in fear of the H-bomb and annihilation, influential child psychologist John Bowlby insisted that a good mother stayed at home with her child. However, while in 1931 10% of married women were in work, that rose sharply to 21% in 1951 and 47% in 1972. My mother became a gifted, but unqualified teacher, and I saw her at her happiest, if not without maternal guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult to be a woman just at present,\u201d said a character in Rosamund Lehmann\u2019s 1953 book, The Echoing Grove. \u201cOne feels so transitional and fluctuating\u2026 so I suppose do men.\u201d\n\nMoney, opportunity (albeit delivered by the carnage of war) and access to education remoulded the working class \u2013 as did the advent of the teenager, the stripling baby boomer, who had plenty left over from a \u201cgood\u201d wage after handing over their keep to mam to invest in mod, teddy boy or rocker gear. The civil rights, anti-authoritarian, liberal, permissive (though not as permissive as the myths have it) attitudes that heralded the sixties were rooted in the experiences of war, the affluence of the fifties and full employment. \u201cTune in, turn on, drop out\u201d had the insurance that there was always a job waiting when flower power waned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Working-class lives: the 1959 film of Look Back in Anger, with Claire Bloom, Richard Burton and Gary Raymond. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive\n\nAt the beginning of the sixties too, the prewar deference \u2013 diluted in the second world war as the inequities of the class system were laid bare \u2013 translated into a cultural and intellectual acceptance of the working class. For the first time, people from my parents\u2019 backgrounds saw their working class-lives mirrored in plays, television, books and Coronation Street, watched by my mother, always the stoic, until just before her 90th birthday. Out went plots set in house parties and country estates, in came Arthur Seaton as the bicycle worker in Alan Sillitoe\u2019s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. \u201cThe air crackled with a new energy,\u201d said Stan Barstow, author of A Kind of Loving.\n\nNineteen-year-old Shelagh Delaney, a theatre usher, wrote a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d play, A Taste of Honey, that wonderfully tells the story of Jo, a 17-year-old working-class girl from Salford having a mixed-race \u201cbastard\u201d baby, befriended by a gay man (at a time when homosexuality was illegal). Delaney\u2019s targets were poverty, homophobia, misogyny and racism. The programme notes for the original production said of Delaney: \u201cShe is the antithesis of London\u2019s \u2018angry young men\u2019. She knows what she is angry about.\u201d\n\nIn John Osborn\u2019s Look Back in Anger, Jimmy, the sweet stall holder and weekend intellectual, rages at his posh wife, Alice. She tells her father, a retired colonel: \u201cYou\u2019re hurt because everything has changed. Jimmy is hurt because everything is the same. And neither of you can face it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scorn which the angry young men hurled at the establishment was a class resentment but one devoid of any class consciousness,\u201d feminist Lynne Segal writes perceptively in Radical Happiness: Moments of Collective Joy. In the decades that followed, shaped by race riots, feminism, Thatcherism, the miners\u2019 strike and the collapse of heavy industry and trade unionism, working-class solidarity appeared to fracture. The rise of what\u2019s now called identity politics began.\n\nIn 1961, sociologist Ferdynand Zweig noted presciently: \u201cWorking-class life finds itself on the move towards new middle-class values and middle-class existence\u2026 the change can only be described as\u2026 the development of new aspirations and cravings.\u201d My mother\u2019s ambition was to move up the social ladder when that was still possible.\n\nToday, paradoxically, middle class by education and income, I anchor myself in the working class. And I\u2019m not alone. In 2016, an Oxford University survey found that the majority of Britons called themselves working class. Nostalgia? Or a yearning for more than looking after number one?\n\nFrom the Blitz to Brexit is a tenuous thread but it is visible. The decades since 1939 have been conflicting and contradictory. In 1968, student and feminist Mary Ingham records in her diary: \u201cWhy am I not happy and married with two kids? Why am I aimlessly wasting away?\u201d Individualism and austerity have shifted blame from a profoundly unequal and unjust society, widely acknowledged in the war, to character failings.\n\nWe have moved from criticism of the systemic to the personal. But in tribute to my parents\u2019 memory, I do believe that what existed at the heart of the people\u2019s war still continues. Namely, a hope that in collective effort, under the banner of freedom and fairness, something better can be built.", "description": "Life for the postwar baby boomers has been full of opportunity and change.
