The Kurds, especially those living in Iraq and Iran, have long been one of the few groups in the region consistently allied with the U.S.\n\nThe Sunday night statement also expressed frustration with how other NATO allies had handled, or not handled, captured ISIS fighters and also put that issue in Ankara\u2019s hands.\n\nMs. Grisham said the U.S. had \u201cpressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came\u201d but \u201cthey did not want them and refused.\u201d\n\nBecause the U.S. \u201cwill not hold them for many years,\u201d she explained, \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
