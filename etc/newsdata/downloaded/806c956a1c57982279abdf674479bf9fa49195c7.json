Sabraw decreed that families should not be separated \"absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.\"\n\nAccording to figures disclosed through litigation, more than 2,800 children were separated from their parents under \"zero tolerance\" as of late 2018. Approximately 1,000 migrant minors were separated from their parents after Sabraw's ruling. The separations revealed on Thursday had never before been disclosed by the government.\n\n\"What's shocking is when we went into court, the government said there is approximately 2,800 families that were separated. We worked for months and months trying to find those families and reunite those families,\" Gelernt said. \"Then we found out only because of an internal watchdog that broke the story that there may have been thousands more families separated ... that the government never told us about, the court or Congress.\"\n\n\"We've finally gotten the list of names from the government,\" he added.\n\nAlthough his group has not been informed about why the government separated the newly identified families, Gelernt said the separations could stem from pilot programs the administration ran before fully implementing the \"zero tolerance\" policy along the entire southern border in the spring of 2018.\n\nGelernt said the new revelations mean the publicly available figures now suggest that the Trump administration separated approximately 5,500 families at the very least.\n\n\"And it's ongoing. That's the really scary part. We get a list from the government every month,\" he said.", "description": "\"Those are 1,600 hundred families we'll now have to find and search all over the world for,\" Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney, told CBS News", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez", "Camilo Montoya-Galvez Is The Immigration Reporter At Cbs News.
