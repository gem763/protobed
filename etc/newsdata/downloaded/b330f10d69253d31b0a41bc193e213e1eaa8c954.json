In one tweet, Trump called it \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth.\u201d\n\nMcEnany insisted that the president is \u201cfighting for the people of Puerto Rico by calling out the corrupt politicians\u201d and claimed that \u201cthere were misused funds last time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Cuomo pointed out, Trump fought tooth and nail to block, cut, and stall passing relief funds for Puerto Rico. Trump has also repeatedly lied that the island has received at least $91 billion (or $92 billion per Trump\u2019s latest claim this week), when less than half of that has been allocated, and far less actually spent.\n\nMcEnany defended the imaginary number as coming from the \u201cestimated projections of what will be provided to Puerto Rico over time.\u201d Ignoring the lies Trump has told about Puerto Rico relief and his opposition to it, she insisted that \u201cthis was the largest FEMA operation in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nThroughout the interview, which touched on a variety of issues beyond Puerto Rico, McEnany defended the president\u2019s record and echoed his attacks on the press. \u201cThe president is lied about constantly,\u201d she said, attacking CNN for being \u201cfake news.\u201d When Cuomo noted that Trump is responsible for creating his own negative coverage, McEnany claimed, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lie; the press lies.\u201d\n\nCuomo was taken aback by the claim that Trump doesn\u2019t lie, and pressed McEnany further on it. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe the president has lied,\u201d she confirmed. At that point, Cuomo brought the interview to a close.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore segueing, Cuomo spoke directly to his audience. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that this president doesn\u2019t lie to you guys, alright?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can argue why he lies, you can argue how you feel about his lies, but if you can\u2019t even admit that, the conversation is dead. I\u2019m sorry, but it is.\u201d\n\nThe interview happened the same day the Washington Post ran a feature on Trump\u2019s new press secretary and communications director, Stephanie Grisham, in which she claimed that she doesn\u2019t think Trump ever lies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re lies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the president communicates in a way that some people, especially the media, aren\u2019t necessarily comfortable with. A lot of times they take him so literally. I know people will roll their eyes if I say he was just kidding or was speaking in hypotheticals, but sometimes he is. What I\u2019ve learned about him is that he loves this country and he\u2019s not going to lie to this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Post\u2019s count, Trump has made over 12,000 statements that were false or misleading since taking office. He averages about 20 such statements every day.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cuomo-Prime-Time-09_45_33-PM.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1"}
