CNN was the first to report the White House severely restricted distribution of memos detailing his calls to Mr Putin and Mr bin Salman.\n\nThe report suggested the move was done out of concern for details of the conversation being leaked, and there was no evidence of anything untoward being said during the conversations.\n\nMr Trump had been furious when details of his conversation with the leader of Mexico on paying for a border wall, and with the leader of Australia about abiding by an Obama administration deal on asylum-seekers, were made public.\n\nIn previous administrations, rough transcripts of presidential phone calls were kept private, but not housed on the highly classified computer system unless sensitive national security information was discussed. Summaries of the calls were distributed to relevant officials in the White House, the state department and other agencies.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
