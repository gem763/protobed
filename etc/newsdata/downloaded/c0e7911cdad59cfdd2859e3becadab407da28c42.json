The designer\u2019s ponytailed silver hair tied, always, with a velvet ribbon, oversized sunglasses, high-collar shirts, Hedi Slimane suits and cut-off black leather driving gloves were as distinctive as personal aesthetics come.\n\nLagerfeld, who died aged 85, once professed he was a caricature of himself. Often accessorised with his beloved pet cat, the ragdoll Choupette (who had two personal maids, an Instagram account and even a book deal), Lagerfeld the man became as globally renowned as his designs, his iconoclastic look being immortalised in cartoons, Steiff teddy bears and Barbie dolls. It was a visual nod to his penchant for satire (which saw him brand everything from boxing gloves to hockeysticks with the Chanel double C logo) and earned him the title of endearment, The Kaiser, from industry insiders.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

For 30 years he was at the helm of Chanel; in 1984 set up the Karl Lagerfeld brand. He was a sartorial tour de force, creating more than 15 collections annually as well as designing costumes for theatre and the ballet productions. An avid illustrator and photographer, the designer shot most of Chanel and Fendi\u2019s advertising campaigns himself and hosted exhibitions of his personal work.\n\nHe was born in Hamburg in 1933 to a wealthy family (facts he rarely alluded to, striving to remain an enigma by manufacturing his personal history in interviews throughout his life as well as changing his original surname from Lagerfelt in order to sound more commercially appealing). Lagerfeld began his career after winning a design competition in 1954, for which he submitted a yellow wool coat that belted at the collar. Off the back of this accolade he was hired as an assistant to the couturier Pierre Balmain in 1955, where he cut his teeth for three years before moving to become art director for Jean Patou, famously saying \u201cI was not born to be an assistant.\u201d At Patou he worked under the name Roland Karl and his early collections received negative reviews, seen as a stain upon the prestigious name of couture.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In 1975 he launched the brand\u2019s first perfume, Chloe Original.\n\nHis work at Fendi from 1967 saw him revitalise the leather goods brand. Much to the horror of animal rights activists, he transported fur from the dusty shelves of aristocratic women to the shoulders of the fashion forward. Dubbed \u2018fun furs\u2019, Lagerfeld\u2019s styles removed linings and, as Rebecca Arnold, professor of history of dress at The Courtauld Institute says, \u201capplied new approaches to render it supple and light\u201d.\n\nIngrid Newkirk, animal rights campaigner and Peta cofounder, has said: \u201cHis passing marks the end of an era when fur and exotic skins were seen as covetable. Peta sends condolences to our old nemesis\u2019s loved ones.\u201d\n\nReinventing Chanel\n\nDespite leaving an indelible mark on both Chloe and Fendi, Lagerfeld\u2019s most powerful legacy undoubtedly lies with his revival of Chanel. By 1983, the French fashion house \u2013 once at the cutting edge of Parisian style \u2013 had become tired and stagnant, bought largely by older traditionalists. On becoming creative director that year, Lagerfeld resurrected the brand, injecting a youthful energy that sent its stocks skyrocketing.\n\nAt the time, Yves Saint Laurent was considered the reigning king of French fashion, with postmodernist designs that clashed high fashion with street style. Lagerfeld adopted a similar method, crystallising the zeitgeist by translating the contemporary fashion lexicon into high fashion pieces.\n\n\u201cThere are very few designers who have changed the course of fashion history. Coco Chanel was one of them, and Karl Lagerfeld was another. His great talent was his ability to identify, articulate, and frequently anticipate changes in the zeitgeist. Effectively, he invented the language of late 20th- and early 21st-century fashion with his creative genius and quickfire, epigrammatic wit,\u201d said Andrew Bolton of the Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nFirst and foremost, though, he referenced the work of his predecessor, Mademoiselle Chanel, in his work \u2013 always paying homage to the founder. \u201cHe was a true chameleon who could adapt to the needs of a brand or the changing moods of society with unparalleled skill,\u201d said Emma McClendon of New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology.\n\nLagerfeld\u2019s first haute couture collection for the house was an ode to Chanel\u2019s earliest silhouettes of the 1920s and 1930s. Chanel had revolutionised fashion following the First World War by adapting traditional unstructured menswear shapes and fabrics (such as tweed and ticking) and repurposing them for womenswear.\n\nThe comfort of menswear appealed to her in an era marked by the restrictive corsetry of womenswear and the Chanel style was simple and versatile, focusing primarily on the comfort of the wearer. She pioneered a democratic style of fashion: her pieces were sold at couture prices but they spoke to an emancipated mood that raised traditional working class fabrics into the realm of couture and lent themselves easily to cheaper copies. This democratisation is something Lagerfeld himself took to in his own high-street collaborations.\n\nLagerfeld adapted the classic boxy tweed Chanel suit of 1925 and reinvented it for the modern age. Appearing in all his collections, his versions stretched Chanel\u2019s fabrication, expanding it to include denim and leather and embellishing it with plastic, wood and even digital printing methods. Where Chanel had referenced her humble beginnings through pedestrian fabrics, Lagerfeld tore and frayed his suits and made them with mini- and maxi-skirts and even hotpants. Chanel herself, would have balked at the latter \u2013 apparently saying of Mary Quant\u2019s miniskirt: \u201cHave they all gone mad?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Karl Lagerfeld's most iconic designs 1/13 70s chic at Chlo\u00e9 Before he worked at Chanel, Lagerfeld designed for bohemian-inspired label Chlo\u00e9. Here, he's pictured alongside a model ahead of showcasing his spring ready-to-wear collection in 1974 for the French fashion house. While there, Lagerfeld became renowned for cementing the label's romantic roots via bold prints and flowing dresses. Rex Features 2/13 His first collection for Chanel Lagerfeld presented his first collection for Chanel in January 1983, which was widely praised by the press at the time for reinvigorating the brand by bringing hemlines up and adding some pizzazz to the label's accessory line. AFP/Getty Images 3/13 The power suit Thanks to Chanel, the suit has become one of the most adored silhouettes during the 21st Century, with a focus on bolero jackets, tweeds, and chiffons. Following years experimenting with denim, faux rips, hot pants, and concrete beads on the suits, for his spring/summer 2016 haute couture collection the designer hinted at the brand\u2019s focus on sustainability, adorning one suit from the collect with finely cut pieces of wood. AFP/Getty Images 4/13 The interlocking logo It's one of the most recognisable logos in the world, but the famous interlocking \"C\" logo might not be on Chanel's products today had it not been for Lagerfeld. The designer modernised the label when he took over as artistic director in 1983, proceeding to put the now-iconic logo on a whole host of Chanel garments and accessories. Some believe the double \"c\" stands for Coco Chanel, in reference to the brand's founder. But others claim it was inspired by a visit by Chanel herself to Ch\u00e2teau de Cr\u00e9mat in Nice, where she's believed to have attended several parties hosted by her friend, socialite Irene Brez. Here, the logo is seen on one of Chanel's most sought-after products: the chain-strap handbag. 5/13 The pink ruffle gown It was the gown that sparked a thousand \"oohs\" and \"aahs\". Lagerfeld ended his spring/summer 2017 show with a thrilling ruffled pink gown as modeled by Lily Rose Depp, whose casting in the show was made all the more significant given that her mother, Vanessa Paradis, was also a model for the brand. Getty Images 6/13 The Fendi 'baguette' It is probably Fendi's most famous item. The slim, baguette bag was designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi, who is the only family member still working at the Italian label. But under Lagerfeld's reign, it has become a cult fashion item, having been reworked season to season with new designs continuously emerging. Getty Images 7/13 CC-logo-ed guitar At Chanel's spring/summer 2009 ready-to-wear collection, the designer sent one model down the runway carrying a CC-logo-ed guitar and matching case. AFP/Getty Images 8/13 The Dying Swan dress Lagerfeld might be better-known for his fashion designs, but he also dabbled in costume and produced this tutu for the English National Ballet in 2009 as part of a special production by the dance company Ballets Russes, for whom Coco Chanel was a benefactor. Getty Images 9/13 The 'lampshade' dress Keira Knightley struck a distinctive silhouette in this Chanel dress, which she wore to Paris Fashion Week in 2014 to attend the brand's autumn/winter show. The corseted layer dress was from the brand's couture spring 2014 collection. AFP/Getty Images 10/13 The multi-layered pearl necklace One of Lagerfeld's most contemporary contributions to Chanel was accessories. The multi-layered pearl necklace continues to be a prominent feature of his collections, and have been firm favourites among celebrities, too. In 2006, it even made an appearance in the cult fashion film \"The Devil Wears Prada\", in which it was worn by lead actor Anne Hathaway to illustrate her character's newfound fashionable taste. Getty Images 11/13 The Karl Lagerfeld x H&M collaboration In 2004, Lagerfeld was the first designer to collaborate with the Swedish retailer, who has been partnering with major fashion brands ever since. The collection prompted huge excitement among Lagerfeld's fans as they reveled in the fact that they could now purchase his designs as a lower price point. Getty Images 12/13 The pregnant bride For the Chanel autumn 2014 couture show finale, Largerfeld walked hand-in-hand with a seven-month pregnant model down the catwalk. The model was dressed in a cr\u00eape de Chine dress with a gold, brocade cape and a line of buttons along the bodice. The model\u2019s hair was teased into a quiff. AFP/Getty Images 13/13 Cara Delevigne's space-age outfit for the Met Gala The model has been a Chanel muse for several years and chose to support the brand at the 2017 Met Gala by wearing a dramatic sci-fi-inspired suit. The suit featured a plunging neckline and bold shoulders, contrasting with the star's smooth metallic-painted silver bald head. The model-turned-actor accessorised the look with a dusting of silver body glitter and a wide silver belt at the waist. 1/13 70s chic at Chlo\u00e9 Before he worked at Chanel, Lagerfeld designed for bohemian-inspired label Chlo\u00e9.

The corseted layer dress was from the brand's couture spring 2014 collection. AFP/Getty Images 10/13 The multi-layered pearl necklace One of Lagerfeld's most contemporary contributions to Chanel was accessories. The multi-layered pearl necklace continues to be a prominent feature of his collections, and have been firm favourites among celebrities, too. In 2006, it even made an appearance in the cult fashion film \"The Devil Wears Prada\", in which it was worn by lead actor Anne Hathaway to illustrate her character's newfound fashionable taste.

The collection prompted huge excitement among Lagerfeld's fans as they reveled in the fact that they could now purchase his designs as a lower price point.

The model was dressed in a cr\u00eape de Chine dress with a gold, brocade cape and a line of buttons along the bodice. The model\u2019s hair was teased into a quiff. AFP/Getty Images 13/13 Cara Delevigne's space-age outfit for the Met Gala The model has been a Chanel muse for several years and chose to support the brand at the 2017 Met Gala by wearing a dramatic sci-fi-inspired suit. The suit featured a plunging neckline and bold shoulders, contrasting with the star's smooth metallic-painted silver bald head. The model-turned-actor accessorised the look with a dusting of silver body glitter and a wide silver belt at the waist.\n\nLagerfeld\u2019s designs at Chanel were peppered with controversy, much like his predecessor. Icing the brand with sex appeal in the 1980s, he sent models down catwalks nearly naked with just camellias over their nipples. In the mid-1990s he took advantage of the prevailing popularity of hip hop, accessorising his collections with enormous gold chains and featuring looks inspired by street style. Another collection saw surfer-style introduced. \u201cHe combined a vast knowledge of fashion history with an insatiable interest in contemporary culture and was never shy of provoking controversy,\u201d says Oriole Cullen of the V&A.\n\n\u201cLagerfeld\u2019s drive, ambition and clarity of vision enabled him to take on not just multiple collections each season, but numerous fashion houses, defining each with his ability to combine a unique identity with an overriding sense of the present\u201d, says The Courtauld Institute\u2019s Rebecca Arnold. His own label, however, never reaped the success he earned at the French fashion houses.\n\nThe spectacle of the catwalk\n\nTo Lagerfeld, fashion was to be worn to perform at the theatre of life. At both Chanel and Fendi he masterminded catwalk shows that became the most theatrical in the industry, bringing collections to life by weaving catwalks around elaborate settings that saw Paris\u2019s Grand Palais transformed into everything from a scaled-down Eiffel Tower; a 148-metre ship that took a month to install; a beach with a moving tidal machine and Chanel lifeguards and a Chanel supermarket and even a space station. For Fendi\u2019s 90th anniversary, he bridged Rome\u2019s Trevi Fountain with a glass catwalk.\n\nCourting controversy\n\nJust as his Chanel predecessor, Madame Coco Chanel herself, Lagerfeld\u2019s life was not without its controversies. Always outspoken and often offensively so, the designer knew how to rub people up the wrong way. In 1994 he faced accusations of cultural insensitivity when he embroidered phrases form the Koran onto dresses, he was outspoken about female celebrities being \u201ctoo fat\u201d once saying of his own weight loss: \u201cFashion is the healthiest motivation for losing weight,\u201d and criticised the Me Too movement.\n\nFor Chanel\u2019s spring/summer 2015 collection, the designer took advantage of feminism\u2019s nascent fourth wave, staging a mock rally that saw models including Cara Delevingne storm down the specially-created \u2018Boulevard Chanel\u2019 waving placards that read \u201cLadies first,\u201d History is her story,\u201d and \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are more than alright.\u201d It was a matter of years before numerous other brands followed suit.\n\nBusiness acumen\n\nHis desire to have his clothes enjoyed by a mass audience and a keen eye for a commercial opportunity saw Lagerfeld creating successful diffusion lines at multiple price points. In 2004, Lagerfeld became the first name in a long line of designers who had collaboration with highstreet chain H&M. The collection sold out worldwide in just two days, though Lagerfeld was incensed by the small production run that went against the intent of giving his collections mass availability, soon dismissing ever working with the brand again. In 2017 he collaborated with skater brand Vans, producing T-shirts printed with his likeness, leather backpacks and redesigned skater shoes and in 2011 he designed a series of Diet Coke bottles.\n\nA lasting legacy\n\nWidely adored in the fashion industry, Lagerfeld was famed for his close relationships with his fashion muses, over the years including the likes of Vanessa Paradis, Kate Moss, Florence Welch and Cara Delevingne. He even walked Kristen McMenamy down the aisle at her wedding to Miles Aldridge in 1997.\n\n\u201cKarl Lagerfeld was a giant of the fashion world. Throughout a long and impressive career, he managed to retain an important place at the centre of the industry,\u201d said the V&A\u2019s Cullen. \u201cHe will be greatly missed by all in the fashion world. As the last practising designer from the 20th century\u2019s golden years of fashion, his passing marks the end of an era.\u201d\n\nTo read more news related to Chanel\u2019s former creative director Karl Largerfeld, click here.", "description": "Aside from the polished\u00a0bob and dark sunglasses of Vogue editor Anna Wintour, there are few who cut as recognisable a silhouette\u00a0as\u00a0Karl Lagerfeld.
