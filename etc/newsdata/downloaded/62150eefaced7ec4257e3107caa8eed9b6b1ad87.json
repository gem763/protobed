That removes a key source of risk from Europe\u2019s equity markets, given the negative impact on demand on a region that is a big net importer of oil and gas.\n\nEven so, oil and gas stocks continued to attract bids.\n\nBrent crude is still trading comfortably above the $60 level that most European majors need to cover their investment needs and dividend obligations. As such, that adds an extra level of certainty to the relatively high dividend yields that most of them offer.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Investing.com, European oil and gas majors currently trade at the following dividend yields:\n\nRepsol (MC:REP) - 6.41%\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Class A - 6.29%\n\nBP (LON:BP) - 6.13%\n\nENI (MI:ENI) - 5.87%\n\nTotal SA (PA:TOTF) - 5.48%\n\nEquinor ASA - 4.82%\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy cash flows for oil companies of course are generally bad news for their customers. As such, Deutsche Post (DE:DPWGn), the owner of DHL, was the biggest loser on the German DAX Wednesday, falling 2.0% after rival FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) profit warning late in New York on Tuesday. Swiss-based logistics group Kuehne & Nagel (SIX:KNIN) was also down 2.4%, although U.K.-based Royal Mail (LON:RMG) escaped collateral damage, rising 0.6% by 5 AM ET.\n\nThe benchmark Stoxx 600 was up less than 0.1% at 389.54, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2% and the Italian FTSE MIB led the way with a 0.5% gain, recovering after Tuesday\u2019s dip. Italian assets were hit by the decision of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to split from the Democratic Party along with a number of senior allies. However, the group will still support the new governing coalition. In similar vein, Spain\u2019s IBEX 35 rose 0.1%, shrugging off the prospect of yet another election after King Felipe called time on Pedro Sanchez\u2019 minority left-wing government.\n\n\u201cMarkets agree that this is no big deal,\u201d said Capital Economics analyst Angel Talavera via Twitter. \u201c(The) economy continues to be much more dependent on external factors as well as its position in the cycle than to who is in power in Madrid.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEDF says no need to close nuclear reactors over welding problems\n\nMore Investors Are Seeing Global Yield Lows in Rear View Mirror\n\nGermany backs draft law to protect parcel delivery drivers", "description": "By Geoffrey Smith", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
