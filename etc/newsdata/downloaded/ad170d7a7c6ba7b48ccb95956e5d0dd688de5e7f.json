Some of the bad vibrations are clearly the repercussions of the two predominant political parties arrayed in thunderous battle against each other. Building in intensity, though, is a throbbing sense that the nation is losing its ability for holding fair elections to public office. On the threshold of the 2020 presidential campaign, voters must hold to account any faction scheming to fiddle with voting machines or with voters\u2019 heads.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s unexpected 2016 White House victory and the subsequent exhaustive investigation into Russian election meddling jarred the public\u2019s confidence in the nation\u2019s capacity for untainted electioneering. Two years on, the shock hasn\u2019t ceased and neither have the threats to the system.\n\nA survey of attendees in advance of the annual Black Hat USA conference for security professionals in Las Vegas last month found that 63 percent believe the next presidential election will be affected by the hacking of voting machines. Titled \u201cConsumers in the Crosshairs,\u201d the survey turned up the same proportion saying they expect Russia to mount cyber-attacks from overseas that will succeed in impacting the election process.\n\nRussia isn\u2019t the only nation fully engaged in cyber-attacks. The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a database of \u201csignificant cyber incidents\u201d during the past 12 months. China is fingered as the purported culprit in the lion\u2019s share of attacks, with Iran and North Korea joining Russia as lesser offenders. And while the majority of incidents are defense-related, the Russians don\u2019t seem to regret the uproar they triggered in 2016: Brushing off its election-tampering playbook, Moscow has been allegedly at it again, this time targeting European government agencies prior to European Union elections in May.\n\nThe cybersecurity experts polled also expressed concern over the danger of social media platforms being used to manipulate information accessed by voters. Relying on election-related information posted on social media to form opinions was rated unwise by 75 percent of respondents, with 80 percent advising that reliance on Facebook, the most popular site, as particularly risky.\n\nSimilar concerns have filtered down to regular users. \u201cDisinformation and the 2020 election: How the Social Media Industry Should Prepare,\u201d a September report released by New York University, predicts that in 2020, Instagram \u201cwill be the vehicle of choice for people who wish to disseminate meme-based information.\u201d Under a credibility cloud, Instagram garners \u201csome trust\u201d by a meager 23 percent of Americans, according to an Institute for Public Relations survey cited in the report. Parent company Facebook scores only slightly higher at 29 percent. Facebook ranked higher than its subsidiary, 64-46 percent, in the unenviable category of being viewed as \u201csomewhat responsible\u201d for spreading disinformation.\n\nFederal officials are scrambling in various directions to prepare for fresh disruptions to the election process. Two measures are pending in the U.S. Senate that would impose automatic sanctions on any nation found to be meddling in U.S. balloting. One introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, would penalize Russian oil firms and financial institutions for interference. Another bill by Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, and Sen. Bob Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, would go further and target the financial interests of Russian political figures, including President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFederal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub is warning the heads of Facebook, Google and Twitter on the need for vigilance against the infiltration of digital disinformation with the approach of the 2020 elections. Unraveling the distinction between \u201cfake news\u201d and the real thing constitutes a virtual Gordian Knot that threatens to entangle the popular platforms in First Amendment violations.\n\nAmericans learning recently that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had his own Twitter account penetrated by a hacker who filled his page with racial slurs may despair of steering clear of mischief-makers wreaking havoc in cyberspace. There is little citizens can do other than roll the dice and hope that knights in shining cyber-armor succeed in blocking malicious hackers from breaching the nation\u2019s computerized ballot-tallying systems.\n\nNo one, though, is forced to depend on social media for reliable information. There are publications out there, including this one, that still honor the old saw of the no-nonsense newspaperman: If your mother says she loves you, check it out. Objective news is the basis for an informed choice.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
