It\u2019s the crispest surveillance footage I\u2019ve ever seen, the scene is well lit for a bar in the middle of the night, and the main player just happens to be perfectly positioned inside the room for viewers to watch his every totally unbelievable move.\n\nAlso, why rob a bar with a long gun instead of with a weapon that\u2019s easier to conceal?\n\nIt\u2019s real, says the bartender. It happened early Wednesday morning at a tavern in St. Louis.\n\nA St. Louis man who\u2019s obviously seen a few things was caught on camera looking completely unphased as an armed thief held up the bar he was drinking in. At one point, the man can be seen lighting up a cigarette \u2014 keeping his cool the entire time and refusing to get up from his chair \u2014 while the suspect points his heavily modified pistol at him. He even refuses to give up his cellphone when ordered by the crook\u2026 \u201cThis is incredible,\u201d wrote one person on Twitter. \u201cDude has no f\u2013ks left.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true. To set the stage for you, the video picks up apparently at the moment the gunman enters the bar, momentarily out of frame on the lower left. Everyone reacts \u2014 except the man who, indeed, seems to have no f**ks left to give.\n\nWhich is probably how it is for a lot of people sitting in a bar in Missouri at 12:30 a.m. in the middle of the week, let\u2019s face it.\n\nThe question that now needs answering: Was the guy blitzed and thus artificially sedate or was he naturally this indifferent to the prospect of a sudden and violent death?", "description": "\u201cDude has no f\u2013ks left.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/b-14.jpg"}
