Both cities have a chronic air pollution problem because of the widespread use of wood as heating fuel.", "description": "Belgrade (AFP) \u2013 Health officials in Serbia warned on Sunday about the risks of \u201cvery high\u201d levels of air pollution in Belgrade and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/01fb28_man-rides-bicycle-on-one-belgrade-bridges-balkans-suffering-high-air-pollution-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
