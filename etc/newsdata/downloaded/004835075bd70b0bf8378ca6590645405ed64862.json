Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden changed the game, the top-ranking House Democrat conceded in a CNN interview late Monday night, but Mrs. Pelosi wouldn\u2019t say whether she fully backs impeachment.\n\nWhen asked whether the caucus will be reaching a decision on impeachment later Tuesday, a senior Democratic aide told The Washington Times: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe substance of the whistleblower report is still not clear, and it has not been made available to Congress.\n\nMrs. Pelosi gave National Intelligence Director Joesph Maguire until Thursday to send the report to lawmakers.\n\nMany Democrats, including presidential hopefuls, have said that if that deadline passes or the allegations prove true, then they should move forward on impeachment.\n\nThese most recent allegations opened the floodgates Monday evening and Tuesday morning with more than a dozen coming out in support of impeachment.\n\nProminent Pelosi allies Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Debbie Dingell of Michigan have been holding out until now.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter of grave urgency,\u201d Ms. DeLauro said in a statement. \u201cAn impeachment inquiry may be the only recourse Congress has if the President is enlisting foreign assistance in the 2020 election. Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation\u2019s history with decisive action.\u201d\n\nSeveral vulnerable swing-district Democrats, with the most at risk politically to support impeachment, are also coming forward.\n\n\u201cIt has become clear that our president has placed his personal interest above the national security of our nation,\u201d New York Rep. Antonio Delgado said in a statement. \u201cHaving taken an oath of office before God and my fellow citizens to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, I can only conclude that Congress move forward with articles of impeachment.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
