I'm a very loving father.'\n\nHe also revealed that he's found it difficult to be accepted back into society after being imprisoned for five weeks in 2017.\n\nJeremy admitted he agreed to take a step back from Caben to protect him, and his unborn daughter has become his 'main focus.'\n\nFormer lovers: On Thursday Jeremy admitted 'not every situation can be fixed' after the dramatic downfall of his romance with Stephanie Davis (pictured in 2017)\n\nPriorities: Jeremy has now said that his unborn daughter has become his 'main focus' (pictured with Amy Childs, 29, and girlfriend Katie at The Baby Show over the weekend)\n\nHe said: 'A lot of people say I don't care about my child because I'm moving on but what options was I left with? I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.\n\n'People say to me \"Why are you acting like you have just one child?\" But there's a time and a place.\n\n'Any one that has half a brain cell needs to understand the reason I am not part of Caben's life is because not every situation can be fixed.\n\n'I protect my son as much as I can. It's not neglecting, it's protecting. I'm a very loving father. This is better for Caben.\n\n'My priority is my baby girl because it's in my control \u2013 I have rights over that. My main focus is my girl.\n\nSecond chances: The reality star said he'll be focusing on his new baby daughter because it's in his 'control' (pictured with Katie in October)\n\n'I've done all the things I needed to do in order to get where I am now. I've got an amazing job and I've moved myself away from certain things.'\n\nJeremy credited Hollyoaks actress Stephanie, 26, for her hard work as a mother but admitted he struggled to cope when her ex Owen Warner, 20, formed a close bond with Caben.\n\nHe said: 'I can't speak about it much for legal reasons, but Steph is doing a great job. She\u2019s doing really well and I know she\u2019s a good mum.\n\n'But you can imagine how hard it was for me. Some 20-year-old being called dad in her last relationship. I thought the whole thing was really distasteful.'\n\nTough: The ex-model said he struggled to see Caben spend time with Stephanie's ex Owen Warner and found the 'whole thing really distastful' (pictured earlier this year)\n\nIn August 2017, Jeremy was found guilty of battering Stephanie in a drug-fuelled rage.\n\nHe was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months \u2013 but was later jailed for breaching his community order by flying to Turkey for a hair transplant.\n\nJeremy says he's living proof a leopard can change its spots after getting himself back on the straight and narrow the last two years.\n\nHe explained: 'Going to prison was a massive wake up call. I had to sit myself down and say \"This is it now\".\n\n'It was hard because in this country people don\u2019t accept rehabilitation well. People need to believe that you can change.\n\n'A leopard never changes his spots isn't true \u2013 I have proven that I have rehabilitated. I hope over a two year period I've shown that. I was an embarrassment to myself. I acted like a f**king d**khead.'", "description": "The reality star, 29, who shares two-year-old Caben Albi with ex-girlfriend Stephanie Davis, showed he's getting ready for the imminent arrival of his newest baby", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20053782-0-image-a-17_1571775983085.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
