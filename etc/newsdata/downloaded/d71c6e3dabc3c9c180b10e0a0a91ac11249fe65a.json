Bradley Byrne (R-AL) told Breitbart News Saturday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) leadership is \u201cblowing up\u201d her impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n\nRep. Byrne told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle that Pelosi\u2019s House Democrat leadership has continued to unravel their impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\nBoyle noted that House Financial Services Committee Chairman Maxine Waters (D-CA) wants to put Trump in solitary confinement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on the GOP to stop Trump\u2019s filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed,\u201d Waters said this week. \u201cImpeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.\u201d\n\nRep. Byrne said that Waters\u2019 comment has continued to discredit Democrat leadership with it\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\n\nByrne explained, \u201cWell, the facts don\u2019t have anything to do with this investigation. I mean if you just look at the facts, there was no there, there. But for somebody in a position of significant responsibility\u2013Maxine Waters\u2013 to want to put the president in solitary confinement, that\u2019s just nuts. Once again that\u2019s a further marker of the fact that these folks have discredited themselves but the way they\u2019re conducting the so-called impeachment inquiry, I mean, you don\u2019t put the president in solitary confinement. That\u2019s just nuts.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama conservative said that all of Pelosi\u2019s leadership, including Waters, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (R-NY) are \u201cblowing up\u201d impeachment inquiry due to their incompetence.\n\nRep. Byrne said that Schiff continues to be \u201cdishonest,\u201d while Nadler \u201chas been discredited by the way he handled the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s chosen the wrong people to lead this investigation and each are slowly blowing up on her,\u201d he added.\n\nByrne said, \u201cEach one of them are slowly blowing up on her. It\u2019s blowing up her so-called inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to waste our time and not fail to focus on more important issues for the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nBoyle then noted that Sen. Jones has called allegations against President Trump \u201cstunning and disturbing.\u201d Rep. Byrne said that Jones is \u201cjust one step away from saying to remove the president from office.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoug Jones is showing his true colors here. He\u2019s a far-left Democrat, \u201d he added.\n\nRep. Byrne said that Jones is an \u201caccidental senator and we\u2019re going to fix the accident next November.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1 P.M.
