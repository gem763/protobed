The company has not given a specific timeline for the resumption of full output.\n\nTwo sources briefed on Aramco's operations said a full return to normal production \"may take months.\"\n\nPrices surged about 20 per cent after the open on Sunday evening, with Brent crude posting its biggest intraday gain since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, before pulling back as various nations said they would tap emergency supplies to keep the world supplied with oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump approved the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which helped limit gains in oil prices.\n\nOil futures climbed higher during the session after the Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen's Houthi movement said the attack was carried out with Iranian weapons, raising the prospect of a global conflict involving the United States and Iran.\n\nMr Trump also said Washington was \"locked and loaded\" to hit to respond to the strike, and the threat of retaliation and an escalation of tensions in the Middle East may keep prices elevated, regardless of any relief from global stockpiles.\n\nUS Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft told the Security Council that emerging information on attacks on the Saudi oil facilities \"indicates that responsibility lies with Iran\" and that there is no evidence the attack came from Yemen.\n\nBritain's UN Ambassador Karen Pierce told the council: \"We're still assessing what happened and who's responsible for the attacks. Once this has been established, we will discuss with our partners how to proceed in a responsible manner.\"\n\nRussia and China urged against hasty conclusions over the attacks.\n\nASIA EXPOSED, PRODUCTS IN DEMAND\n\nSaudi oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters, but the attack raises concerns about how long the kingdom will be able to maintain oil shipments.\n\nMajor importers of Saudi crude, such as India, China, Japan and South Korea, will be the most vulnerable to any supply disruption. South Korea has already said it would consider releasing oil from its strategic reserves.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined products after the attacks, which may have also cut Aramco's refining capacity, consultancy Energy Aspects said.\n\nAramco Trading Co is making enquiries to buy diesel for prompt delivery, trade sources said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [NEW YORK] Oil ended nearly 15 per cent higher on Monday, with Brent logging its biggest jump in over 30 years and a record trading volumes, after an attack on Saudi Arabian crude facilities cut the kingdom's production in half and intensified concerns of retaliation in the Middle East. .
