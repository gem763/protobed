The Tube plus Heathrow Express journey to the airport and check-in time adds 1h15, and frequent trains run from Manchester airport to Oxford Road station \u2013 close to the conference centre \u2013 in about 20 minutes. That adds up to a total journey time of 2h 45m. The cheapest air fare going north on Monday and south on Tuesday is \u00a3271, excluding luggage and airport transfers.\n\nTrain\n\nVirgin Trains runs a service every 20 minutes from London to Manchester, typically taking 2h 7m. From Westminster to the London terminus at Euston takes 15 minutes by Tube (Jubilee line to Green Park, then the Victoria Line). From Manchester Piccadilly to the venue is a 15-minute walk. Total time: 2h 37m, not counting the time to buy a ticket \u2013 which ranges from \u00a389.60 for a time-restricted Off Peak return to \u00a3484 for a First Class Anytime ticket.\n\nThe fare can be reduced by at least half by using London Northwestern Railway trains from London to Crewe with onward connections on Virgin Trains or Northern.\n\nCar\n\nAccording to AA Route Planner, the 210 miles between Parliament Square and the convention centre should take 3h 53m in normal traffic. The prescribed route involves the A4, M4, M25, M40, M42, M6 Toll, M56 and A556. The estimated fuel cost for the one-way journey is \u00a333.45, assuming the vehicle does 40 miles per gallon.\n\nBus\n\nMegabus has plenty of availability at around \u00a324 each way. The average journey takes 5 hours. Victoria Coach Station and Shudehill Interchange are within walking distance of both Westminster and the conference centre, giving a total journey time of 5h 30m.\n\nThe most environmentally friendly form of motorised transport is also likely to be slowest. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Manual: Britain recommends taking the Northern Line of the London Underground to Brent Cross, from where the roundabout at the southern end of the M1 is accessible. It is rated three stars (out of five). Heading south from Manchester, the roundabout at the junction of the A57 (M) and Princess Road is an acceptable two-star location for thumbing, and within walking distance of the conference centre.", "description": "Parliament has voted against suspension of proceedings for the Conservative Party Conference 2019, which runs from Sunday 29 September to Wednesday 2 October.
