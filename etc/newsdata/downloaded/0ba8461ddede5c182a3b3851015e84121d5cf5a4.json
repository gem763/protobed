Photo: Debrocke/ClassicStock/Getty Images\n\nSchool is back in session, which means lunch-packing season is in full swing. Whether you\u2019re packing grub for a toddler, primary-school kid, a tween at secondary school, or even yourself, having the right lunch box and lunch gear can streamline the process of getting a meal together, keep the leftover tofu stir-fry from leaking onto the cheddar-cheese cubes, and cut down on extra plastic and waste. But which lunch box to choose?\n\nWe asked 14 teachers, parents, and nutritionists to tell us about their favorite dishwasher-friendly lunch boxes, easy-to-open containers, and playground-proof thermoses that are best for kids of every age. And while we\u2019ve broken the lunch boxes and gear down into age groups here, most of the items here can be used by kids of any age (and adults, if you\u2019re looking for something for bringing your lunch to work).\n\nBest overall lunch box: bento-style lunch box\n\nEight of the 13 teachers and dietitians we spoke to recommended bento-style lunch boxes for kids. These boxes, which can come in a variety of materials, including stainless steel and plastic, allow parents and kids to separate their meal into a variety of smaller portions. \u2018We see many lunch boxes, and by far the most popular seems to be the bento-box style,\u2019 says Kristin Brady, director of Cobble Hill Play School, who adds that she uses a bento-style lunch box herself. \u2018I think the magic lies in the various different compartments \u2014 children love to make their own choices. Even if parents choose the contents, children get to choose the order [in which they eat the foods]. Some of our parents even report letting their children pick the contents for one compartment while they pick the others \u2014 this way, packing lunch can be something that happens with children rather than just for children.\u2019\n\nPlanetBox Rover Stainless Steel Lunch Box PlanetBox was the brand we heard about again and again, for kids of all ages. \u2018PlanetBoxes are stainless steel, so better for the environment, and they come in three sizes, so you can vary based on child size, age, or appetite and have a lot of accessories to tailor to the family needs,\u2019 says childhood nutrition and feeding expert Jill Castle. Nutritionist and mom of three Lauren Antonucci likes PlanetBox\u2019s lunch boxes because they make a healthy lunch look more appealing. \u2018What\u2019s really good about that one, especially for the younger and middle kids, is that you can make it look really fun to eat fruits and vegetables by putting different colours of fruits and vegetables in different places,\u2019 she says of the brand\u2019s boxes. \u2018And because all of the little compartments are small, even if you did want to put a treat, it\u2019s going to be small.\u2019 And while the price may seem a little high for a lunch box, the nutritionists and parents we spoke to found that the container was versatile enough to be used over many years. Stacie Billis and Meghan Splawn, co-hosts of the family-focused food podcast \u2018Didn\u2019t I Just Feed You,\u2019 are fans, and so are their kids: \u2018Stacie\u2019s 9-year-old has been taking his lunch to school in their PlanetBox Rover ever since he was in Montessori,\u2019 says Splawn. She uses them with her own kids as well. \u2018I like that it\u2019s a single moulded piece, so no crevices where food can get crusty. And clearly they hold up \u2014 in all these years, we\u2019ve only had to buy new insulated sleeves,\u2019 she says.

[Editor\u2019s Note: This product price doesn\u2019t take into account additional shipping costs.] \u00a340 at PlanetBox Buy\n\nLunchBots Large Trio Stainless Steel Lunch Container Many of the parents, teachers, and nutritionists we spoke to named LunchBots as another (slightly less expensive) go-to brand for stainless-steel bento boxes for younger children. \u2018LunchBots are really great for little kids who don\u2019t need a ton of food,\u2019 says Antonucci. She suggests adding a main item, like a soup or a sandwich, and filling the smaller compartments with fruits, veggies, cheese, and a \u2018secondary treat,\u2019 like cheese crackers or dessert. Dietitian Robin Kaiden seconded the recommendation, noting that LunchBots \u2018fit in standard-size lunch boxes\u2019 (unlike PlanetBoxes, which require the brand\u2019s own carrying cases). Food writer and founder of the Children\u2019s Food Lab Jill Santopietro also recommended LunchBots, which she says are \u2018dish-washable, nonplastic, lightweight, and easy to open.\u2019 \u00a337 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nYumbox Original Leakproof Bento Lunch Box Container Castle nominates Yumbox\u2019s lunch containers as her favorite bento-style boxes. \u2018Yumbox is leakproof, has an insertion that shows what foods go where, so there\u2019s some subtle nutrition education, and it\u2019s great for reception and young primary school kids,\u2019 she says. \u2018They have so little time to eat at school and the three compartments hold just enough for my kids to get what they need to eat and actually finish it.\u2019 Milana Shabekova, director of early childhood education at JCC Brooklyn, told us that these are the most popular lunch containers in her school, and that they work well both for warm foods and cold foods when insulated with an ice pack. \u00a325 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nUtopia Kitchen Glass Food Storage Container Set If you\u2019d rather pack food in individual containers, Chloe Smith, a teacher at Saint Ann\u2019s School and mother of a 5-year-old, says that she likes Bayco\u2019s glass containers and puts them directly into her daughter\u2019s unicorn-themed backpack. \u2018She can open the tops of the food containers on her own, so I would definitely say they are kid-friendly,\u2019 Smith says. [Editor\u2019s note: Bayco isn\u2019t readily available in the UK, but these Utopia glass storage boxes are a good alternative.] \u00a337 for 18 at Amazon UK Buy\n\n\u2018The amount of juice cartons and string-cheese wrappers we throw away over the course of the year is really astonishing,\u2019 says Nora Painten, science and garden teacher at Red Hook Play Group. She\u2019s been reducing waste by packing food in reusable bags: \u2018If my children need an extra snack, I\u2019ll use a reusable cloth Velcro bag like the ones by Lunchskins for a sliced apple,\u2019 she says. \u2018I also love using Bees Knees or Etee waxed canvas for wrapping sandwiches.\u2019 Painten notes that these products can be used by kids as young as 2, but can be helpful for anyone trying to cut down on their plastic use (we\u2019ve sung the praises of Bee\u2019s Wrap before, too).\n\nWildkin Kids Insulated Lunch Box And for carrying lunch gear to school, Ilona Zeltser, site director of the JCC Brooklyn Windsor Terrace, says that Wildkin lunch boxes are very popular among her program\u2019s younger kids. Kristin Brady also mentioned Wildkin as a favoured lunch box brand at her school, too. The lunch box comes in a wide range of patterns, which would appeal to kids of all kinds. We especially like this cheery yellow one. \u00a313 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest lunch boxes and gear for elementary-school kids\n\nLunchbots Large Snack Tray Steel Lunch Container All of the items that were recommended for young kids can be used by older kids (including, as we noted earlier, our winning lunch box, the Rover). But as kids get older, the size of the lunch box will probably get larger. For instance, a growing school kid may want to graduate from LunchBots\u2019 three-compartment offering to their larger snack tray. \u2018It\u2019s great for kids who like variety,\u2019 says Billis. \u2018We like that it\u2019s dishwasher-friendly. Also, what kid won\u2019t be sold on a lunch box that\u2019s called a snack tray?!\u2019 \u00a339 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nKlean Kanteen Double Wall Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Food Canister For packing a hot lunch, Antonucci recommends Kleen Kanteen\u2019s containers. \u2018Kleen Kanteen makes some really good-quality, throw-\u2019em-around-the-play-yard \u2014 not saying they should, but they\u2019re going to \u2014 \u201creally easy to screw on and off, nothing leaks, you can put hot stuff in there, it\u2019ll stay moderately warm\u201d containers,\u2019 says Antonucci. \u2018But the biggest thing is they\u2019re sturdy, they\u2019re durable, they\u2019re not going to break, and they\u2019re really easy to close, so for those little kids, those work really well.\u2019 \u00a326 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nTo-Go Ware Bamboo Travel Utensils \u2018We have bamboo utensils that I\u2019ve had for years and years,\u2019 says Antonucci, who cites To Go Ware as her favorite brand. \u2018It has a fork, a knife, a spoon, and chopsticks in this cute little holder. Every once in a while, the kid will lose one, but it\u2019s still so much better than all of that plastic.\u2019 She packs the sustainable utensils in her kids\u2019 lunches. \u00a325 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest lunch boxes and gear for middle-school kids\n\nStasher 100% Silicone Reusable Food Bag \u2018For older children in primary school, who find lunch boxes too \u201cchildish,\u201d I love Stasher bags as the environmentally friendly alternative to sending single-use plastic,\u2019 says Silber. \u2018They\u2019re reusable, resealable, silicone-based bags that come in different sizes from smaller snack bags that would fit a sandwich.\u2019 Silber notes that while these might seem a little pricey for a snack bag, Stasher bags are dishwasher-, freezer-, and oven-safe, so they can be used for cooking and storage beyond packing lunches. Antonucci seconds the silicone pouch recommendation. \u2018You could put a banana in a silicone pouch so it doesn\u2019t leak in the backpack \u2014 the crackers can go in there, the grapes, the cheese, and they have tiny ones that you could put a smaller serving size in. I use them all the time,\u2019 she says. The bags were also recommended to us when we asked sustainability experts about the best ecofriendly kitchen items. \u00a320 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nWaxed Canvas Lunch Bags Brown Paper Bag Styled Billis told us that for her 12-year-old son, the idea of carrying a lunch box is \u2018mortifying\u2019 \u2014 \u2018so a brown bag it is,\u2019 Billis says. \u2018I\u2019m hoping I can at least appeal to his ecofriendly nature so that he\u2019ll carry a reusable brown bag.\u2019 She suggested this waxed canvas lunch bag, which has that classic brown-bag look without the waste. \u00a315 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nOXO Good Grips Leakproof On-The-Go Salad Container \u00a315 (was \u00a316, now 6% off) \u2018For middle-schoolers who are willing to take a healthy salad to school, I love this OXO salad container that has a separate dressing container to prevent soggy salads,\u2019 says Silber. \u2018The lids are easy for kids to open.\u2019 She also likes the brand\u2019s \u2018On the Go\u2019 container , which \u2018fits both a sandwich and a bowl that can be filled with fruits and veggies.\u2019 \u00a315 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
