In most states, the party in power draws election districts \u2014 which means the maps can be manipulated to give one political party an advantage. But independent commissions leave voting maps up to a bipartisan group of people, limiting the role of elected officials.\n\nEight states already have an independent redistricting commission, and legislation to create one was introduced this year in at least a dozen more states, according to Ballotpedia. But not one of those at least a dozen states passed the legislation.\n\nThe bills failed to even make it out of committees in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. In New Hampshire, Republican Governor Chris Sununu vetoed the legislation.\n\nBills are still pending in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. But prospects appear grim in Pennsylvania, where the bill has nearly 100 bipartisan cosponsors but has been stuck in committee since April. The same is true in Tennessee, where the bill has just one sponsor and hasn't seen any action since February.\n\nAlthough legislators on both sides of the aisle support independent redistricting commissions, it may be up to the voters to weigh in on the issue. In 2020, questions that could create an independent redistricting commission may appear on ballots in Arkansas, Oregon, South Dakota and Virginia.\n\nIf they do, there's a high chance they will pass. According to a bipartisan poll by the Campaign Legal Center, at least 60% of Democrats, Republicans and Independents support turning redistricting over to an independent commission.\n\nThe states that already have an independent redistricting commission are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Montana and Washington.", "description": "The Supreme Court has made it harder to fight, and reform bills are failing, but the issue could appear on 2020 ballots in several states", "authors": ["Caroline Cournoyer"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/b19588a3-880a-4beb-8fd7-f07982777b8b/thumbnail/1200x630/871fbc0e64c14557fc18685480754111/ap-19080535603704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
