Hundreds of reported sightings only added to the mystery.\n\nIn 2015, a letter and photo of two of his sons, signed with his name and the message 'I am still alive', was delivered to an AFP journalist but experts could not verify its authenticity.\n\nThe alleged killer evaded a police dragnet in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery.\n\nHundreds of people take part in a march on April 26, 2011 in the French western city of Nantes, in memory of the five Dupont de Ligonnes family\n\nThe alleged killer evaded a police dragnet in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery (pictured: Nantes, April 2011)\n\nEuropol is the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation which has helped in the eight-year hunt for De Ligonn\u00e8s (pictured: Police hunt De Ligonn\u00e8s in the south of France)\n\nYesterday evening, French media outlets reported that De Ligonn\u00e8s had been arrested at Glasgow Airport following a flight from Paris.\n\n'He was travelling under a false identify and had changed his appearance completely,' said an investigating source.\n\n'He did not try and resist arrest, but information corresponded with what is on a Europol search card. It is now being double checked. He is now in the hands of Scottish police.'\n\nEuropol is the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation which has helped in the eight-year hunt for De Ligonn\u00e8s.\n\nLast year police searched underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, in the south of France, where De Ligonn\u00e8s was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011.\n\nHe had fled Nantes a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks.\n\nDetectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of those who had been killed.\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations.\n\nA police seal on the front door of Dupont de Ligonnes' family home in Nantes after French authorities issued an international search alert\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s had been arrested at Glasgow Airport following a flight from Paris and was travelling under a false identity\n\nIn confiscated emails he said that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to 'the masses'.\n\n'I think I've got a superiority complex, you could call it that,' he wrote. 'But it's based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.'\n\nRecalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonn\u00e8s added: 'All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grand-mother and mother. To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.'\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens, abandoning his car there.\n\nHe was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a camera.\n\nAn extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information \u2013 police resumed it last year, but found nothing.\n\nFrench authorities have been searching for Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s without success ever since the bodies of his wife, Agnes, and four children - Arthur, Thomas, Anne and Benoit - were discovered (pictured: French police hunting de Ligonn\u00e8s in April 2011)\n\nThere was a theory that De Ligonn\u00e8s may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police were searching for remains of his body.\n\nHowever, prosecutors had never ruled out the possibility that De Ligonn\u00e8s was living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France.\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s's ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue.\n\nFive months before the murders, De Ligonn\u00e8s said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club.\n\nReceipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies.\n\nIt also emerged that De Ligonn\u00e8s, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties. Among those he had been asking for money was a mistress in Paris.\n\nAccording to Scottish police the arrested man's 'digital fingerprints' correspond to that those recorded for De Ligonn\u00e8s, French media reported.", "description": "Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, 58, was subject to an international arrest warrant for the 2011 killings in a mystery that transfixed France.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/07/19618818-0-image-a-11_1570862134837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
