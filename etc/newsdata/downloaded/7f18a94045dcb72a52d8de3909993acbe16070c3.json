So it built a format called Social Display, which basically takes an advertiser's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter creative and repurposes it for web ads, and it says they perform better than publisher's traditional ads and Facebook itself.\n\nRead more: The Information has tapped Spotify and BuzzFeed execs as it looks to double its business team\n\nPolar made the tech available to the rest of its publisher clients starting this year after an exclusivity period with News Corp. and Verizon Media.\n\nSince then, 120 Polar clients, including Bloomberg, Vox Media, and NBCUniversal have sold the product to 1,500 advertisers across 2,500 campaigns, Kunal Gupta, CEO of Polar, said.\n\nThe pitch to publishers is that these ads can solve banner blindness and make their display ads more compelling to users, and hence, advertisers.\n\nFor advertisers, the pitch is that they can create these ads with no extra work or cost to their Facebook ads.\n\n\"Banner ads have been ignored by users but also by advertisers \u2014 they haven't invested in the format,\" Gupta said. \"The advertisers love the idea of, you build it once and reuse it. So we engineered a solution where the advertiser doesn't have to spend more money.\"\n\nPolar says its ad format outperforms old-fashioned banner ads\n\nPolar said that across those 2,500 campaigns, the engagement rate \u2014 0.6% \u2014 is far higher than that of standard banner ads. (The rates vary by industry, but Google has estimated click-through rates for banner ads to be as low as an abysmal 0.05%.)\n\nPolar also says its Social Display ads have an average view time of nine seconds \u2014 compared to the 1.7 seconds Facebook says its users spend with a piece of content on mobile and 2 1/2 seconds on desktop.\n\nGupta hopes results like that will get advertisers to shift some of their Facebook ad budgets to publishers.\n\nSocial Display is a \"significant opportunity\" to shift back some of the ads going to social platforms, according to Steve Sottile, the president for North America at the social-video-ad platform Unruly, whose parent, News Corp., helped develop the ad format.\n\nMike Rucker, the creative director of NBC News Brand Studio at NBCUniversal, said users were interacting with the ads far more often than they were with standard display ads. He speculated that's because people scroll more slowly on NBCUniversal's sites than they do on social media, and the sociallike format stands out.\n\n\"There's no denying the big dogs are getting more of the pie, so there's a growing sense of urgency for brands in how to capture attention and for publishers to retain and reclaim those dollars,\" he said.\n\nSocial Display ads don't solve other publisher problems, though\n\nIt's tempting to think old-media companies could thrive by beating Facebook at its own game. But there are other obstacles keeping publishers from shaking loose advertising from Facebook.\n\nEven if the ads perform well, publishers can't compete with Facebook on scale, audience, and targeting.\n\nThe Social Display ads are suited to advertisers that need to drive awareness but less so to performance-focused marketers.\n\nPublishers have to fight inertia from ad agencies and marketers who are entrenched in habitual ways of buying media.\n\nPublishers also might have to deal with turf wars between competing agency teams that might both lay claim to buying such ads.\n\nPlus, there could be resistance from agency staffers who make banner ads and could find themselves displaced by the new ad format.\n\nMarcus Witte, the senior vice president of business practices at Cadreon, IPG Mediabrand's ad-tech unit, said Social Display was an easy way for advertisers to extend their social campaigns, and the units perform well, but they're limited to the number of publishers running them. \"You can't get millions of impressions,\" he said.", "description": "Polar built ads that use Facebook creative from social ads and says they are getting viewed for a whopping 9 seconds.", "authors": ["Lucia Moses"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d23abafa17d6c13535ac582-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
