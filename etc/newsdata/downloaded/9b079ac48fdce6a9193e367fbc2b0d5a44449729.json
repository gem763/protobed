He\u2019ll score 20 goals a season with his eyes shut. They\u2019re in disarray, so go and get him.\u2019\n\nPochettino would hate to see Kane leave north London, but was full of praise for Keane as he responded to the comments, and said that his striker \u2018deserves everything.\u2019\n\n\u2018I heard what was said,\u2019 Pochettino told a press conference. \u2018Of course, I respect him and admired him when he was a player. He was the kind of player who you want beside you, or as a centre-back like me you want him in front of you.\n\nMauricio Pochettino made an unlikely admission about Kane (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Whenever I listen to him he is very clinical in his comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Of course he loves good players and Harry Kane is a fantastic player. We more than agree Harry Kane deserves everything.\u2019\n\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted that he is a big fan of Kane, but dismissed his chances of bringing in the prolific forward.\n\n\u2018Roy\u2019s quite straightforward isn\u2019t he,\u2019 joked Solskjaer. \u2018For us it\u2019s working hard, getting Anthony back is gonna be a massive boost for us and I\u2019m sure when Anthony comes back that\u2019ll help Marcus as well. With the forwards we\u2019ve got and the pace, I\u2019m looking forward to the next few weeks.\n\n\u2018There aren\u2019t many\u2026 Lewandowskis and Harry Kanes, they\u2019re like Shearer, Van Nistelrooy, fantastic players. Ours are diff types of players but I like someone who can finish half a chance and he does that. Harry\u2019s one of the best but he\u2019s a Tottenham player.\u2019\n\nFormer Arsenal star Paul Merson agrees with Keane that the Red Devils should get the cheque book out because Kane is a safe investment.\n\n\u2018Manchester United need to go and break the bank because they need a goalscorer,\u2019 Merson told Sky Sports. \u2018For me, he\u2019s one of the best around and he\u2019s proven.\n\n\u2018They need someone to come in and hit the ground running with 25 goals next season. \u2018He\u2019d be moving to the biggest club in the world. Even if they spent \u00a3120m, you know you\u2019re buying goals and you wouldn\u2019t be sweating. \u2018He\u2019ll get you 25 goals a season without you sweating.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Paul Merson tells Manchester United to sign \u00a3120m Harry Kane\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjar responds to Roy Keane\u2019s claim Manchester United should buy Harry Kane", "description": "Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino 'more than agrees' with Roy Keane after the Irishman said Manchester United should buy Harry Kane.
