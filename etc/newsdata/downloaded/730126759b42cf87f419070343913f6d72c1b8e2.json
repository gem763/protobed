For all of his talk of homelessness, Mr. Trump indicated to reporters that his sympathies rested with the taxpayers, rich immigrants and business leaders forced to wade through California\u2019s urban detritus.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, they came from other countries and they moved to Los Angeles or they moved to San Francisco because of the prestige of the city, and all of a sudden they have tents,\u201d Mr. Trump exclaimed to reporters before disappearing behind the cloistered mansions of Silicon Valley. \u201cHundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building. And they want to leave.\u201d\n\nThat did not endear the president to politicians already indisposed toward his overtures.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a slumlord who has spent his presidency pushing people into homelessness by taking away health care, food assistance and affordable housing funds,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco. \u201cHe has no credibility on housing and homelessness.\u201d\n\nFew people like to acknowledge it, but there are things the Trump administration and California policymakers basically agree on. On Monday, the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers released a 40-page report on homelessness that was full of grisly and true statistics, such as California being home to one-twelfth of the country\u2019s people but about half of the nation\u2019s unsheltered homeless. The report also blamed many of California\u2019s own policies, like its strict building and environmental regulations, for creating it. That is a fact that the state\u2019s legislative analyst\u2019s office and politicians from Gov. Gavin Newsom on down routinely affirm.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s awful descriptions of California\u2019s housing woes can\u2019t be worse than those of the state\u2019s most liberal politicians. But that\u2019s where the agreement ends.", "authors": ["Conor Dougherty"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/us/politics/17dc-trumpcalif-promo/17dc-trumpcalif-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
