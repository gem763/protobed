Netanyahu, who counts on the working-class, Gaza border towns as part of his electoral base, was himself whisked away by bodyguards from a campaign event on Tuesday when Palestinian militants fired rockets toward the area where he was.\n\nIsrael withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and Hamas militants overtook the territory by force two years later. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and engaged in several other rounds of violence over the past decade.\n\n\u201cI do not wage war unless it is a last resort and I don\u2019t risk the lives of our soldiers and citizens just to get applause,\u201d Netanyahu said in an interview with Kan Reshet Bet Radio. \u201cWe will probably have no choice but to set out on a big campaign, a war against the terror forces in Gaza.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t start it one minute before we are ready, and we are preparing for a \u2018different war\u2019,\u201d he added, shortly before flying to Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt was Netanyahu\u2019s first major interview to a mainstream media outlet in a frenetic campaign in which he has been dictating the agenda with a dizzying array of maneuvers.\n\nJust this week, he alleged fraud in Arab voting areas and pushed for legislation to place cameras in polling stations on election day. He also claimed to have located a previously unknown Iranian nuclear weapons facility and vowed to annex the heart of the West Bank if he wins re-election.\n\nHis pledge to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley sparked international condemnation. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said that if it were carried through it would be a \u201cserious violation of international law.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. statement comes after Saudi Arabia, a regional power that has grown closer to Israel in recent years, condemned the move, along with several others who warned it could inflame the Middle East and eliminate any remaining Palestinian hope of establishing a separate state.\n\nNetanyahu said it was important to act now as President Donald Trump prepares to unveil his Mideast peace plan after the elections next Tuesday in Israel. The move was widely viewed in Israel as Netanyahu\u2019s latest stunt to draw in right-wing voters in a hard-fought campaign.\n\nIn a statement issued Wednesday evening, the Russian foreign ministry said it took note of Netanyahu\u2019s announcement and the \u201chighly negative reaction in the Arab world.\u201d It said it would share its concerns with Israel since \u201cimplementation could trigger a sharp escalation in the region and undermine hopes for establishing a lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.\u201d\n\nPrior to his departure to Sochi, Netanyahu said the focus of his talks with Putin would be to promote the \u201cjoint goal\u201d of removing Iranian forces from neighboring Syria. Netanyahu and Putin have met regularly in recent years to coordinate military activities in Syria.\n\nNetanyahu has for years argued for aggressively countering Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its regional belligerency and often takes pride in having a strong working relationship with both Putin and Trump.\n\nHowever, Netanyahu\u2019s clout in Washington appeared to take a hit this week with the firing of one of his like-minded allies in the administration, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and amid reports that Trump was considering meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and easing sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn his radio interview, Netanyahu defended his record.\n\n\u201cWhere did this strong sanctions policy against Iran come from if not from the struggle that I led? Indeed, I have had influence on Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell the president of the United States with whom he should meet, but there is not one person who has influenced more, and continues to influence, the aggressive stance against Iran than me, and everyone knows that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that continued rocket fire from Gaza is making another war against militants in the coastal strip inevitable, his latest headline-grabbing announcement just days before he seeks re-election in a nationwide vote.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aron Heller"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/israel_settlements_06688_c0-538-6424-4283_s1770x1032.jpg?b696ea5a8f7177dfb76198eb8dbce5c7f407a5af", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
