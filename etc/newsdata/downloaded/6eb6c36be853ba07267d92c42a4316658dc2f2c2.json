Then the Baghdad bureau chief for The Washington Post, I drove with Iraqi and American colleagues to Sadr City, the sprawling slum on the outskirts of the city. We watched hundreds of black-clad religious militiamen, waving their AK 47s in the air and calling for revenge, in what would be the start to a campaign of sectarian killing and torture.\n\nDuring visits to Baghdad's morgue over the next two days, I saw Sunni families thronging to find the bodies of loved ones killed by the militias. The morgue's computer registrar told the grim-faced families and me that we would have to be patient; the morgue had taken in more than 1,000 bodies since the Samarra bombing, and was way behind on processing corpses.\n\nHere's the thing, though: According to then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his top commanders, it never happened. These killings, these dead, did not exist. According to them, reporters like myself were lying.\n\n\"The country is not awash in sectarian violence,'' the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. George Casey said, on talk show after talk show, making the rounds to tell the American home-front not to worry. Civil war? \"I don't see it happening, certainly anytime in the near term,\u201d he said, as he denied the surge in sectarian violence.\n\nCasey had taken his own drive around Baghdad after the bombing of the Samarra mosque and had seen, not executed bodies in the streets but \u201ca lot of bustle, a lot of economic activity. Store fronts crowded, goods stacked up on the street.\u201d\n\nDonald Rumsfeld held a news conference at the Pentagon to say that U.S. press reports of killings\u2014such as mine that estimated 1,300 dead in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, based on what I had seen at the morgue, interviews with Sunni survivors, U.N. and Iraq health officials\u2014were calculated \"exaggerated reporting.\" Iraqi security forces, he said, \u201cwere taking the lead in controlling the situation,\u201d everything he assured his listeners was \u201ccalming.\u201d\n\nHere's the thing, though: According to then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his top commanders, it never happened. These killings, these dead, did not exist.\n\nAmerican journalists in Baghdad were under attack not just from Iraqi insurgents, but, at least verbally, from our own country's civilian and military commanders as well.\n\nAfter the mosque bombing, I had the twisting-in-the-wind experience of attending the weekly press briefings at the Green Zone\u2014this war\u2019s four o\u2019 clock follies\u2014and have the military spokesman insist that things were great, implying that the problem wasn\u2019t the executed and mutilated bodies now found in the streets; the problem was people like me.\n\nThanks to WikiLeaks, though, I now know the extent to which top American leaders lied, knowingly, to the American public, to American troops, and to the world, as the Iraq mission exploded.\n\nThe American troops, who were risking their lives on the ground, witnessed and documented it themselves.\n\nHeavily redacted, the log entries offer surreal but chilling glimpses of the chaos that followed the Samarra bombing on Feb. 22. Within hours of the bombing, U.S. troops reported gunmen attacking; open street fighting between Shia and Sunni militias; rocket-propelled grenade attacks on mosques; assassinations and kidnappings.\n\nLater, one U.S. military patrol happens on militia members dumping bodies on the side of the street. The killers speed away, leaving the American soldiers with a grim discovery: \u201cbodies shot in the face\u2026still warm,\u201d according to one log.\n\nIraq was not \u201ccalming,\u201d as Rumsfeld would have it. Rather, this was sectarian war, and, over the next few months, the Bush administration\u2019s effort to convince the world that everything was hunky-dory in Iraq became less and less sustainable as the slaughter continued. According to the synopsis of the WikiLeaks documents by The New York Times, the death toll in 2006 reached beyond 3,000 one month.\n\nLate last year, I sat in on a seminar at Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government led by a former Bush official in Iraq and heard her say matter-of-factly that more than 1,000 people died in one day in the immediate killing after the Samarra bombing.\n\nBut as the WikiLeaks documents show, Casey and Rumsfeld must have known that all along, owing to the accounts from their forces. Despite the statements of the top U.S. commanders at the time, it wasn\u2019t the journalists in Baghdad who were lying.\n\nEllen Knickmeyer is a former Washington Post bureau chief in Baghdad and Cairo.
