There followed four more tries in the next 16 minutes for New Zealand to race to 63-0.\n\nOne of them went to lock Scott Barrett, who joined his brothers Beauden and Jordie as try-scorers, supplementing their milestone as the second trio of brothers to play in the Rugby World Cup after the Vunipola brothers of Tonga in 1995.\n\nThere was no more scoring through the last quarter, but only because the pace the All Blacks were playing at was too quick for even themselves, and passes were knocked on or forward. Dominating almost every category and making most of the running, the All Blacks made 15 handling errors. They had more than 60 per cent of the ball, and 70 per cent of the turf.\n\nOn Friday, Canada takes on two-time winner South Africa.\n\nWATCH | Canada crushed by Italy at Rugby World Cup on Sept. 26:", "description": "New Zealand gave Canada a 63-0 thrashing on Wednesday in that was expected in the Rugby World Cup at Tokyo.
