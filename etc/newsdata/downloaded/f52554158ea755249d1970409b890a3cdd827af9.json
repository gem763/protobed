It's too much. Honestly, it's too much,' Guardiola said ahead of Saturday's crunch game at Crystal Palace.\n\n'The broadcasters pay a lot of money. They don't look at these players or this club. What is best for my money now, to pay back, they do it. That's how it works.\n\n'The broadcasters are the bosses, it's not about us. I'm concerned for the players. It's a business. The people do not care about the players. He's injured? OK, another one.' Guardiola then joked: 'Maybe the broadcasters are fans of another club.'\n\nMAN CITY'S CHRISTMAS SCHEDULE (Premier League fixtures only) December 3 - Burnley A December 7 - Man United H December 15 - Arsenal A December 21 - Leicester H December 27 - Wolves A December 29 - Sheffield United H January 1 - Everton H\n\nLIVERPOOL'S CHRISTMAS SCHEDULE (Premier League fixtures only) December 4 - Everton H December 7 - Bournemouth A December 14 - Watford H December 21 - West Ham (Postponed) December 26 - Leicester A December 29 - Wolves H January 2 - Sheffield United H\n\nThere are less than 118 hours between City's three matches over Christmas - at least 25 hours shorter downtime than in any of Guardiola's previous three seasons.\n\nTop-flight managers will have to devise a plan of how their players properly recovery in such a short space of time.\n\nGuardiola added: 'Players to the fridge. I'm not joking. Go home, open the fridge, and get inside for 48 hours. See you at the Etihad Stadium. When I open the fridge to make an omelette maybe I can talk with my players. But apart from that, no way.'\n\nGuardiola asked if this was the shortest time City have ever had to recuperate between matches and, after conformation that it was, said: 'We have this honour.' City had attempted to push the Sheffield United fixture back to December 30 but that came to nothing.\n\nHe said: 'The broadcasters are the bosses,' before joking: 'Maybe they're fans of another club'\n\n'We have meetings with Premier League, the managers... they are so glad - nice pictures, nice coffee - (but) it doesn't matter, we have to play,' Guardiola said. 'On another day we'll have more recovery time than the others, it is what it is.\n\n'We've solved it in the past and we'll solve in the future. If we can't solve anything then we cannot win four titles in one season. This year we will try with the problems that we have in several positions. We accept it.\n\n'I'm sure last season we had less days between games compared to Liverpool, most of the time. We didn't say anything. No, go and play and try to win. And we won the Premier League.'", "description": "City play Wolves on December 27 before hosting Sheffield United two days later and Guardiola claimed the authorities place no emphasis on protecting players.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/14/19885870-0-image-a-5_1571405806317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
