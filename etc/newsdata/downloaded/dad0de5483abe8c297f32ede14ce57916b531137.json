REUTERS/Andrew Winning/File Photo\n\nThe talks, which mark a turnaround in fortunes since 2017 when Bovis rejected a bid approach here from Galliford, come amid a slowdown in Britain's housing market, partly due to uncertainty caused by the country's departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe individual businesses lack scale and by combining they might be better placed to compete with industry heavyweights like Barratt Developments (BDEV.L) and Persimmon (PSN.L),\u201d said Russ Mould, investor director at AJ Bell.\n\nA deal would also allow Galliford to concentrate on turning round its other construction interests.\n\nGalliford shares surged more than a quarter in value to a six-month high of 780 pence in early Tuesday trading. Bovis\u2019s shares fell about 4%.\n\nEarlier this year, Bovis was in talks to buy Galliford\u2019s Linden Homes and Partnerships & Regeneration divisions for 950 million pounds in shares and the assumption of 100 million pounds in debt, but discussions ended after Galliford said they were not in its shareholders\u2019 interests.\n\nUnder the new proposal, Galliford shareholders would get 0.57406 Bovis shares for each Galliford share they own, implying a value of 675 million pounds, and Galliford would also be paid 300 million pounds in cash.\n\n\u201c(The) new cash element will be a welcome injection for the newly reorganized Galliford construction division, which has been struggling after problems with the Aberdeen bypass and the Queensferry crossing,\u201d Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said.\n\nGalliford and Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) were left finishing the Aberdeen contract, one of Scotland\u2019s biggest motorway projects, following the high-profile collapse of Carillion.\n\nWilson noted that Galliford\u2019s negotiating position had weakened since the last round of talks with Bovis collapsed, following a profit warning in April.\n\nBovis said it would fund the cash part of the deal from an equity placing, additional debt and existing resources.\n\nGalliford shareholders would own about 29.3% of the enlarged Bovis, while Bovis would also take on Galliford\u2019s 10-year debt worth 100 million pounds.\n\nGalliford\u2019s pension schemes would transfer to Bovis as well.\n\nBovis said significant work was still needed before a definitive deal could be signed, including agreeing on commercial terms, due diligence and arranging funds.\n\nBovis also reported a 20% rise in profit for the six months ended June 30 to 72.4 million pounds, adding it had not seen any significant change in customer behavior ahead of Brexit.\n\nGalliford, which has reduced its exposure to Central London where the housing market slowdown has been most marked, is best known for construction projects ranging from the redevelopment of the Wimbledon tennis venue to hospitals and city bypasses.", "description": "Britain's Galliford Try has restarted talks to sell its residential housing businesses to Bovis Homes after Bovis nudged up its proposed offer to 1.08 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) and included a cash component.", "authors": ["Shashwat Awasthi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428238358&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890IV", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
