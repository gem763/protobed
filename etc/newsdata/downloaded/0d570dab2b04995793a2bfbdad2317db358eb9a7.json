In hindsight this one was easy. We already know that Team Trump is pursuing a \u201cmax trollishness\u201d strategy in campaign merchandising, cranking out items like Trump-branded plastic straws (paper straws are for left-wing wimps) and funny t-shirts goofing on Chris Cuomo\u2019s insecurity as the \u201cFredo\u201d of his family. Sometimes it\u2019s about owning an individual lib, sometimes it\u2019s about owning the libs collectively, but either way the thinking is the same \u2014 the Trump campaign is going to hawk stuff that lets the buyer believe he\u2019s irritating the left with his purchase.\n\nApart from limiting immigration and protecting gun rights, the GOP platform in 2019 is basically just \u201cliberal tears.\u201d Team Trump\u2019s online store recognizes that.\n\nSo how could they pass on the opportunity to sell cheapie Trump-branded markers? The campaign sold $670,000 worth of straws in their first month of availability. They\u2019re bound to make a killing on this too.\n\nBuy the official Trump marker, which is different than every other marker on the market, because this one has the special ability to drive @CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy! #KeepMarkersGreathttps://t.co/eakgICM0LR \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) September 6, 2019\n\nFive markers for 15 bucks sounds like a deal.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t followed \u201cSharpiegate\u201d and don\u2019t know why markers are suddenly an item of interest for Team Trump, read this and this. He\u2019s still tweeting today that he was right all along that the hurricane threatened Alabama at one point, even having his campaign tweet out week-old CNN clips chattering about the state possibly being affected. It\u2019s all gaslighting, though: Alabama was out of the storm\u2019s path by August 31st, the day before Trump included it in his tweet about states that might be affected. The worst \u2018Bama faced by the time he tweeted was a small possibility of tropical-storm winds in the southeastern corner of the state. He gave the public outdated information, a minor mistake. But because he\u2019s Trump, instead of owning up to it he\u2019d rather quintuple down in Queeg-like fashion \u2014 even reportedly doctoring the map he showed off in the Oval Office on Wednesday to include Alabama in the storm\u2019s path.\n\nIt was Trump who used a black Sharpie to mark up an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map, which he displayed during an Oval Office briefing on Wednesday, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cNo one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\u201d the official said of the map, which added Alabama into the hurricane\u2019s potential pathway inside the loop of the marker. Several White House officials argued that media coverage of the Alabama issue has been unfair to Trump, but one senior administration official said that \u201cas long as it\u2019s in the news, he is not going to drop it.\u201d\n\nWhen he was asked after the Oval Office photo op who had drawn on the map, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d A source told Fox News yesterday that someone else had done it during a briefing but that never seemed plausible, as he\u2019s the only person in the administration who cares that the earliest forecasts included Alabama in the storm\u2019s path. According to CNN, in fact, Trump saw Fox\u2019s skeptical coverage yesterday and called reporter John Roberts into the Oval Office to plead his case in person that he\u2019d been right all along. Now that the campaign\u2019s markers gimmick has given the media a new hook, there\u2019s every reason to believe he\u2019ll still be tweeting about it on Sunday, stretching this story into a full week. I figure we\u2019ll get 10 minutes minimum on the subject at his next rally, with \u201cAlabama was in the initial projections!\u201d a new MAGA applause line.\n\nWhy has this moronic nothingburger dispute caused both sides to commit to such a lengthy fight? Andrew Egger captures part of it: Trump is Trump, and pushing back on him is just what anti-Trump commentators do now.\n\nAs the president\u2019s interminable war with the Fake News drags on, it\u2019s become clear that our media is poorly equipped to handle stories where the appropriate takeaway is obvious. The professional takester is supposed to trim away the useless gristle of the news to reveal the juicy meat concealed within\u2014and further, to do so in a wholly original and non-derivative way. That approach works well when the news is complicated\u2014a big new policy proposal to break down and chew over, say. It works less well for stories whose morals are plainly visible to the naked eye\u2014and these are the stories that seem to occupy more of the news. The takeaway from the Sharpie story is obvious: \u201cthe president is a media-addled old fool who can\u2019t be trusted to read a map, let alone operate our nuclear arsenal.\u201d How are 500 columnists supposed to pad that out to 800 words? The unfortunate result has been that much anti-Trump punditry is simply boring. If the humorists have trouble improving on the joke, we\u2019re the folks tasked with the unenviable task of explaining it. You could read a thousand takes on Sharpiegate, but not a single one of them would approach the near-transcendental, anything-is-possible high you got the first time you saw Trump whip out that lunatic map.\n\nIf he\u2019s going to go on being obviously wrong for days, people whose job it is to point when he\u2019s wrong are going to go on ad nauseam about it for days too. I think this case is special, though, in that the sheer triviality of Trump\u2019s error and the petty lengths to which he\u2019s gone in refusing to admit to it have paradoxically led his critics to dig in deeper than they might on a matter of greater import. It\u2019s practically a test of wills now: Can he wear down his critics into letting this matter drop through the sheer persistent force of relentless gaslighting even when they have him dead to rights on the facts? He tweeted bad information last weekend, he briefly panicked a state, and instead of admitting it he\u2019d prefer to fight a week-long media battle replete with outdated maps intended not so much to prove that he was right as simply to make the other side give up in exasperation and let him declare victory. Can he get his antagonists let him win even when he\u2019s so plainly wrong? That\u2019s why they\u2019re holding out. They don\u2019t want to let him.", "description": "\"his one has the special ability to drive CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy!\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
