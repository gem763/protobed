It was President Trump, who has brought the American people massive job creation, a stronger economy, lower taxes and a booming energy sector that has put us on the road to energy independence.\n\nI predict that millions of voters who learned about the Democrats\u2019 energy plans will have no choice but to turn to Trump to avoid the disaster those plans would bring.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE'D BACK US FUNDING FOR THIRD WORLD ABORTIONS, BIRTH CONTROL AS PART OF CLIMATE PLAN\n\nAnother winner on Wednesday night was renewable energy, which was supported by all the Democratic candidates at the town halls \u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; businessman Andrew Yang; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nAnd there were two big losers of the night.\n\nFirst, science. It was replaced by magical thinking on the part of the 10 Democratic candidates, who believe they can translate the hopes and dreams of environmental zealots into reality.\n\nThe other big loser was the American people \u2013 who have no choice on the Democratic side for a candidate who advocates sound environmental policies based on reality that will not cripple our economy and throw millions of people out of work.\n\nAll of the candidates promised \u201cgreen jobs. All of them claimed their policies will create opportunities across America. But future promises pale in comparison to reality.\n\nUnder President Trump we have record-high employment and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. We have cheap energy \u2013 compared to the \u201cgreen\u201d energy in Europe where people pay three and four times much as we do utility costs.\n\nOur abundant fossil fuels mean that despite hurricanes and Iranian hostility, gasoline prices remained very low even at the height of summer.\n\nDemocrats embrace a doomsday clock ticking to 2030 \u2013 saying we must get off fossil fuels by then. This is a constant fearmongering tactic that Americans are tired of. We aren\u2019t ready to surrender our jobs, our steaks, our cars, our air-conditioning and heat for a socialist power grab. Americans want to be winners.\n\nThe Green New Deal, climate hysteria and all 10 candidates cannot make Americans believe what science, math and history show to be true.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the green energy the Democratic candidates embrace holds a lot of potential and has a bright future years from now, all of the candidates ignored a few inconvenient truths, if I may borrow a phrase for former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that the president of the United States is not a dictator. Many of the proposals by the Democratic candidates are sure to run into resistance by Republicans and even many Democrats in Congress. So just because a new president says he or she wants to take certain actions to fight climate change doesn\u2019t mean Congress will authorize and fund them.\n\nSecond, green technology is completely sustained by tax subsidies, and cannot survive in the marketplace without them. The candidates glossed over how to raise the trillions of dollars needed to fund these subsidies \u2013 a critical problem with various versions of the Green New Deal and even less ambitious programs.\n\nIt\u2019s like saying you\u2019d like to buy a $20 million mansion for your family \u2013 and will worry later about how to pay for it.\n\nWe have to face the facts: There aren\u2019t enough \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d \u2013 the group demonized by so many of the Democratic candidates \u2013 to pick up the tab for the green revolution the presidential hopefuls want to fund.\n\nThe green revolution would require massive tax increases on all of us \u2013 taking a lot of green out of our wallets and crippling consumer spending that fuels our economy and creates jobs.\n\nThe candidates and moderators also completely ignored the fact that green technology is not at all \u201cgreen.\u201d It requires tremendous amounts of fossil fuels, and particularly the most targeted: coal.\n\nCoal forges steel \u2013 900 tons of which is required for each wind turbine. Coal is the main ingredient in concrete \u2013 2,500 tons of which is required to anchor each wind turbines. In other words, without coal we do not have wind power.\n\nThe other panacea of the greener tomorrow is electric vehicles. Teslas, like all electric vehicles, are reliant on enormous tax subsidies to make them affordable to consumers. And it is curious, maybe even unfair, that at the same time, taxpayers provide thousands of dollars to purchase these cars, Tesla\u2019s founder has become a multibillionaire without incurring the wrath of any candidate. And Teslas, just like all electric vehicles, need to be forged with steel. Which requires coal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nElectric vehicles also require tremendous amounts of rare earth elements, most of which are not found in America, requiring China to play ball. If we force consumers to only buy electric vehicles, we are basically building China\u2019s economy \u2013 just like we did when we moved manufacturing out of the Rust Belt.\n\nOn top of this, while electric vehicles don\u2019t emit carbon dioxide, many power plants producing electricity run on fossil fuels. Replacing all those power plants would be an enormously expensive undertaking. And many Democrats oppose a massive turn to nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide but faces opposition because of safety concerns and concerns about disposing of atomic waste.\n\nFinally, another loser in the very long night of political spin was Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who lost his battle to keep a climate debate out of the Democratic primary process.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe American people are on a figurative first date with the 2020 presidential candidates right now. You never want to show your crazy side on a first date.\n\nAfter the long night of the Democratic environmental talkfest, we should be skeptical about another date with any of these candidates.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DANIEL TURNER", "description": "The biggest winner of the night wasn\u2019t even on stage...", "authors": ["Daniel Turner"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/27/694940094001_6077888013001_6077880670001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
