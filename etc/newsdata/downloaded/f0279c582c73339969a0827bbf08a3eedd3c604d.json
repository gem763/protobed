I\u2019m 30 lol #ageist .\u201d\n\nShe then added: \u201cI\u2019m literally in shock. I don\u2019t get what\u2019s wrong with the one aggressive when dancing. Her fave song I think, she went in.\u201d [sic]\n\nHowever, this led to fans urging the beauty to be \u201cstop lying and to \u201cadmit she is in the wrong.\u201d\n\n\" @lauraanderson1x being in the public eye you need to be mindful of what you say even if you dont mean offence. You\u2019ve clearly slipped up and upset alot of people by your comment so why don\u2019t you just take accountability, educate yourself and apologise its really that simple but people never want to admit that they\u2019re in the wrong which is the problem instead you are here trying to sugarcoat it\u201d contributed a follower.\n\nOthers added: \u201c @lauraanderson1x if you meant energetic you should of said that, instead of pulling her arm and then putting on a scared face while saying she\u2019s very \u2018aggressive\u2019, and, \u201c @lauraanderson1x aggressive is not energetic. Stop lying ?\u201d\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\nIt was not the first time Laura commented on Yewande's behaviour.\n\nDuring the 2019 series of Love Island, Laura gave an interview to the Daily Star where she admitted she was not a fan if Yewande\u2019s fiery personality.\n\nShe said:\"Yewande has shown a side of herself that I don\u2019t really like.\n\n\"She\u2019s being a bit of a moody brat. Her behaviour was really uncomfortable to watch and I\u2019m not sure she deserves Danny.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it will work between them in the long run. I don\u2019t think she can expect much from Danny if she isn't giving him much attention.\n\n\"She is a nice girl but she is playing it wrong.\"", "description": "Both the Love Island stars attended Anna Vakali and her sister Mandi's intimate shoe launch party", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Nightvision", "Splashnews.Com", "Gc Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541161.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Simmi-Shoes-collection-launch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
