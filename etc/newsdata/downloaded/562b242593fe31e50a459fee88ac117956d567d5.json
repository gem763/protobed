Because of this huge profit potential, the major TV networks have maintained a firm grip on the broadcast rights to NFL games. Compared to other leagues, streaming any NFL game you want is a bit more complicated, and more expensive.\n\nBasically, the games are spread across five different networks. Games with an NFC home team are aired on Fox, games with an AFC home team on CBS, Sunday Night Football on NBC, Thursday Night Football on NFL Network or available for streaming via Amazon Prime or Twitch, and Monday Night Football on ESPN. Wherever you are watching from determines which games get aired on your local networks.\n\nYou can access these channels without a cable subscription via streaming services like HDTV antennas, Hulu with Live TV, Sling TV, fuboTV, and NFL Sunday Ticket. Additionally, NFL RedZone can be added as a bonus for fans who want to watch all the action from across the league simultaneously rather than sit through one game.\n\nThese services can all be accessed through most smart TVs, game consoles, and streaming devices like Apple TV, Roku, or Amazon Fire TV Stick. They can also be streamed on-the-go via smartphones, laptops, and tablets.\n\nHere's how you can stream all the NFL content you want without signing up for a traditional cable subscription.", "description": "The NFL season is here, and that means that people without cable need to find a way to stream games.
