The FBI hierarchy has said it officially started investigating Trump campaign aides free of any dossier presence.\n\nAn examination of available testimony by The Washington Times shows evidence to the contrary. Former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele\u2019s stunning but discredited allegations of a wide and deep Trump-Kremlin conspiracy were available to FBI decision-makers beforehand, the evidence suggests.\n\nFormer FBI agent Peter Strzok, who began the counterintelligence investigation, has acknowledged relying on the dossier. When when asked by Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, at a June 2018 closed session about when he first obtained dossier allegations, Mr. Strzok refused to say.\n\nFormer FBI Director James B. Comey has provided a precise timeline while promoting his memoir, \u201cA Higher Loyalty.\u201d He categorically ruled out the presence of dossier information at FBI headquarters before July 31, the day campaign adviser George Papadopoulos became a target.\n\n\u201cThe information that triggered it was the Papadopoulos information that came in late July,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cThe FBI didn\u2019t get any information that\u2019s part of the so-called Steele dossier, as I understand it, until after that. And so the investigation was triggered entirely separately from the Steele dossier.\u201d\n\nJames A. Baker, former FBI general counsel, was asked by House investigators last year whether the allegation that started the investigation on July 31 had anything to do with the dossier.\n\n\u201cBased on the information that I have seen in the public domain, I think I can answer it. And I think the answer is it did not have to do with the dossier,\u201d he testified.\n\n\u2018Trying to fool the FBI\u2019\n\nThe dossier\u2019s role is one of the questions Attorney General William Barr wanted answered when he chose Mr. Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, as a special investigator. His mission is to determine the probe\u2019s origins and decision points.\n\nMr. Barr has chastised Mr. Strzok for his text messages that showed a deep bias against Mr. Trump. The attorney general has questioned the 2016 FBI decision to use informants for a what he called a \u201cperipheral player\u201d \u2014 Papadopoulos.\n\nThere is evidence that dossier material arrived before July 31.\n\nMr. Steele beseeched Rome-based FBI agent Michael J. Gaeta to visit London in early July 2016 to hear his sensational allegations against candidate Trump. Mr. Gaeta won trip approval from Victoria Nuland, who was assistant secretary of state.\n\nMr. Gaeta arrived at Mr. Steele\u2019s Orbis Business Intelligence office in London on July 5 and was greeted with horror stories. Mr. Steele handed him dossier pages. FBI practice would be for Mr. Gaeta to fill out a Form 302 containing Mr. Steele\u2019s charges and circulate it to headquarters in Washington.\n\n\u2981 That same month, Ms. Nuland has said, she was given several dossier pages. She said she instructed staff to give the documents to the FBI.\n\n\u201cThe dossier, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding, and our immediate reaction to that was, this is not in our purview,\u201d Ms. Nuland said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThis needs to go to the FBI if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian Federation. That\u2019s something for the FBI to investigate. And that was our reaction when we saw this. It\u2019s not our \u2014 we can\u2019t evaluate this.\u201d\n\n\u2981 In testimony to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Glenn R. Simpson, co-founder of opposition research firm Fusion GPS, said he gave Mr. Steele permission in early July to start talking to the FBI. Mr. Simpson was a paid Clinton campaign agent and handled Mr. Steele.\n\n\u201cAnd by approximately early July, like 1st or 2nd, I had given my assent to him doing it as a professional obligation or a citizenship obligation. And then that\u2019s when he did it, sometime around the Fourth of July,\u201d Mr. Simpson testified.\n\nQuestion: \u201cSo in early July, is it fair to say in early July that you knew that Mr. Steele had taken some information to the FBI?\u201d\n\nAnswer: \u201cI think he said he was going to, and then later he told me he did.\u201d\n\nA House Republican staffer told The Washington Times: \u201cWe have genuine concern Steele and Simpson were trying to fool the FBI into investigating Trump much earlier than the public testimony suggests. This is one of the big questions John Durham is looking into.\u201d\n\nAfter a nearly two-year investigation into President Trump and colleagues, special counsel Robert Mueller in March said he didn\u2019t find a Trump-Russia election conspiracy. His 448-page report, when compared with the dossier, eviscerates Mr. Steele\u2019s conspiracy allegations, of which a Washington Times analysis found to have totaled 13.\n\nMr. Strzok could have settled the question of when dossier material first reached his counterintelligence desk when he testified in a closed-door session before a House task force last year. But he declined to answer, citing the Mueller investigation that was still open.\n\n\u201cWhen did you first read it?\u201d Mr. Jordan asked.\n\n\u201cAgain, that gets into a level of investigative detail about an ongoing investigation that I don\u2019t think the FBI or the special counsel want me to answer,\u201d Mr. Strzok said. \u201cI am happy to answer it, but I defer to what I think the appropriate FBI equities are in this regard.\u201d\n\nMr. Strzok became famous with the disclosure of his strident text exchanges with his then-lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Both expressed deep dislike for Mr. Trump during the investigation.\n\nWhat is missing so far in the investigation of the dossier is a gauge of how Mr. Steele influenced FBI decision-makers and their attitudes toward Mr. Trump and his aides. Mr. Steele depicted them as traitors and felons conspiring with Kremlin operatives to hack Democratic computers and conduct information warfare.\n\nAgain, Mr. Mueller didn\u2019t find this.\n\nConspiracy allegations\n\nAlthough Mr. Strzok officially began the investigation on July 31, events indicate it started earlier, perhaps as a preliminary inquiry.\n\nStefan Halper, a Cambridge University professor and foreign policy figure in Washington, was an FBI Trump-Russia informant. His graduate assistant reached out to Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser, in late June 2016 and invited him to a security conference, the Daily Caller reported. Mr. Halper also touched base with campaign adviser Sam Clovis in mid-July.\n\nMr. Steele began work for the Democrats, through Fusion GPS, in mid-June.\n\nHis first dossier memo, one of 17 completed in December 2016, is dated June 20. Mr. Steele\u2019s Kremlin intelligence operatives were his sources. Mr. Steele said Mr. Trump was a Moscow informant and was receiving regular dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Mueller, assigned to find \u201cany links\u201d between Trump associates and the Kremlin, found no such relationship.\n\nMr. Steele\u2019s July 19 memo alleged a Trump-Russia \u201cextensive conspiracy.\u201d It said that during Mr. Page\u2019s public speaking engagement in Moscow he had discussed bribes for sanctions relief.\n\nThe Mueller report confirmed none of this and, in fact, found no conspiracy. No Trump campaign adviser was charged with any election conspiracy.\n\nIt is documented publicly that the FBI received dossier allegations in August 2016, shortly after the official investigation started.\n\nThe key link was Bruce Ohr, then an associate deputy attorney general at the Justice Department. Mr. Ohr testified that he met with Mr. Steele in Washington on July 30, 2016, talked with him via social media and ferried the information directly to FBI headquarters. His first stop was then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Ms. Page in August.\n\nMr. McCabe launched a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump in May 2017, shortly after the president fired Mr. Comey.\n\nHow the dossier\u2019s unfounded allegations of a Trump-Kremlin relationship influenced that decision is not known publicly. In his memoir \u201cThe Threat,\u201d Mr. McCabe avoided any dossier discussion to include his role.\n\nHe has suggested that Mr. Trump was a Russian agent \u2014 a supposed relationship not found by Mr. Mueller.\n\nThe FBI had an immediate interest in hearing Mr. Steele, who had worked as an informant on soccer scandals.\n\nAgents cited the dossier as the primary piece of evidence to obtain at least one yearlong wiretap on Carter Page. Mr. Comey briefed President Obama on the dossier and later President-elect Trump.\n\nFBI agents met with Mr. Steele a second time in Rome and agreed to pay him $50,000 to keep investigating Mr. Trump. The FBI eventually assigned a case agent to Mr. Steele in 2017 for continuous flow of anti-Trump information.\n\nBy that time, the Trump investigation was well underway. Australia notified the FBI in mid-July that Papadopoulos told one of its diplomats that he heard Moscow may own thousands of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. The Australian tip triggered Mr. Strzok to open an investigation.\n\nThe answer to exactly when Mr. Strzok and his unit first received dossier material is likely contained in a secret 113-page transcript. It is an interview by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with Mr. Gaeta, the agent who met Mr. Steele in London on July 5.\n\nThe transcript of that hearing is now in the intelligence community\u2019s hands. Agencies are determining how many of Mr. Gaeta\u2019s words can be released to the public.\n\nIn the bestselling book \u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Mr. Gaeta, after hearing Mr. Steele on July 5 recite Mr. Trump\u2019s crimes, told the former spy, \u201cI have to report this to headquarters.\u201d\n\nTom Fitton, who heads the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, has acquired FBI-Russia documents through open documents lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThey are giving us nothing on Gaeta. Unusually secretive on him and the whole cabal,\u201d Mr. Fitton told The Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
