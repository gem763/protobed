Combs, 20, of Gainesville, Florida, was arrested Friday on charges of attempted murder, sexual battery, aggravated battery, aggravated assault and kidnapping, according to his arrest affidavit, which was obtained by the Gainsville Sun.\n\nPolice said the incident started when Combs went to the his 19-weeks' pregnant girlfriend's home early Friday morning.\n\nThe woman, who had been dating Combs for about a year, was on the phone when he arrived.\n\nPolice said that Combs waited for her to hang up the phone before telling her that 'I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t let you have my son.'\n\nCombs then allegedly grabbed the woman by her hair and dragged her to the living room, where he punched her and kicked her in the stomach multiple times. He was said to have then pulled her - again by her hair - upstairs, where he continued to punch and kick her in the belly.\n\nPolice said that the woman attempted to run back downstairs, but that Combs caught her and started to punch and slap her in the head.\n\nCombs is being held on $3.5million bail at the Alachua County Jail (pictured) in Florida\n\nWhen he saw that the woman was bleeding from a small cut on her head, Combs allegedly tried to wipe up the blood with napkins, before beating her again, while saying 'I\u2019m sorry, but I have to kill the baby.'\n\nThen, Combs was said to have held a four-inch folding knife to the woman\u2019s throat, at which point the woman reportedly said: 'I\u2019ll do anything, but don\u2019t take my life.'\n\nAccording to police, Combs told the woman to 'do it to yourself,' ordering her to slit her wrists - specifying that she cut vertically, instead of horizontally 'for results,' according to WCJB.\n\nWhen the pregnant and battered woman made a move to comply, he allegedly told her to stop and then raped her.\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene, they said the woman had extensive bruising on her stomach, as well as bruising on both arms, her shins and her right breast.
