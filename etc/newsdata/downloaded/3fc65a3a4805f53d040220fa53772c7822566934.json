I\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing that because they\u2019re the ones that are going to inherit the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a very difficult situation at the moment, especially in the U.S., where all the environmental controls that were put in place \u2014 that perhaps were just about adequate ... have been rolled back by the current administration so much that they are all being wiped out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. should be the world leader in environmental control has lost that and has now decided to go the other way,\u201d Jagger added.\n\nHe also said he was worried about \u201cwhere all this polarization and rudeness and lying\u201d in the U.S. and now the U.K. is \u201cgoing to lead us.\u201d\n\nActor Donald Sutherland agreed with Jagger on the environment. \u201cMick is right when he said the reforms that were instituted during the Obama administration were barely adequate, and now they\u2019re being torn apart. It\u2019s the same in Brazil, and they will be torn apart in England.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen you\u2019re my age, when you\u2019re 85 years old and you have children and grandchildren, you will leave them nothing if we do not vote those people out of office in Brazil, in London, in Washington. They are ruining the world. We have contributed to the ruination of it, but they are ensuring it.\u201d\n\nThe two men appeared together to promote the closing film at the festival from director Giuseppe Capotondi, \u201cThe Burnt Orange Heresy,\u201d in which they both star. The thriller is about \u201cfake[ness] and truth ... so it is part of this modern dialogue,\u201d said Jagger, referring to politics.\n\n\u201cWe are going through a very strange time. You know you are living in it but you don\u2019t know what is going to happen at the end,\u201d he added.\n\nYou can check out their remarks in the video above.", "description": "\u201cThe U.S. should be the world leader in environmental control, but now it has decided to go the other way,\u201d said the Rolling Stone.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d749e672300009f03512770.jpeg?cache=nxemekdkfi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
