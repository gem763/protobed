I've always said, in any democratic Parliamentary system the decision will be in the hands of the ruling party. Meaning I leave it to the PH council,\u201d Anwar told reporters in Parliament.\n\nAnwar and his deputy Datuk Seri Azmin Ali have been perceived to be at odds with each other for months, fuelling speculation that the former may not succeed Dr Mahathir as expected.\n\nThe rift between the two PKR leaders have also resulted in Opposition lawmakers like Umno\u2019s Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein inviting Malay parties to forge a new political alliance to govern the country, leaving out PH component parties DAP and Amanah.\n\nBut when asked if Azmin's comments for Dr Mahathir to remain prime minister was inappropriate, Anwar merely said: \u201cIt's ok lah, we understand the background\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister-in-waiting was also asked his view of Dr Mahathir\u2019s remarks on Kashmir, which prompted a boycott call from an Indian trade group.\n\n\u201cHe was probably presenting the sentiments of some in the country, but we have to find a way to solve this amicably because it's important for our economy.\n\n\u201cPM Mahathir is known to be very consistent with his views,\u201d Anwar said when asked if Dr Mahathir\u2019s remark was too harsh and if the latter should apologise for it.\n\nDr Mahathir was critical of India\u2019s violent actions to control Muslim-majority Kashmir during his address at the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly in New York last month.\n\nThe prime minister had remained firm about his statement and sees no need for an apology, despite allegations of interference by Indian groups.\n\nRelated Articles Wan Azizah: Liu\u2019s statement on PH govt without Bersatu, is just an opinion Ronnie Liu denies sabotaging Pakatan, says loves coalition and still supports Dr M PKR info chief reminds party leaders of pre-election promise on power transition", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 23 \u2015 Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim today said the Pakatan Harapan (PH) leadership council will decide whether or not he is to replace Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad mid-term....", "authors": ["R.
