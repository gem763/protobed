Meadows: Comey\u2019s congressional testimony at odds with what he told IG Horowitz, new referral needed", "language": "en", "text": "The DOJ Inspector General\u2019s work is never done. Just last month IG Horowitz released a report which concluded that former FBI Director James Comey violated bureau policy by treating official records as if they were his personal documents. Today, Horowitz testified before Congress and was asked by Rep. Mark Meadows about some apparent discrepancies between what Comey told the IG during that investigation and what Comey had said during congressional testimony last year. Rep. Meadows said a referral would be forthcoming and Horowitz agreed to look over the information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken, now, your report and we\u2019ve put it side by side [with] congressional testimony that James Comey made before the joint oversight and judiciary hearing and I\u2019m finding just a number of irregularities,\u201d Meadows said. He continued, \u201cSo would it be appropriate if ranking member Jordan and I were to refer those inconsistencies to the IG and if we did that would the IG look at those inconsistencies?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly appropriate for us to get a referral about a then-employee of the department, which is I think the hearing you\u2019re probably referencing, and then we would assess it,\u201d Horowitz replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you one example,\u201d Meadows said. Referring to testimony Comey gave in December of 2018, Meadows continued, \u201cMr. Gowdy was asking, he said \u2018Did you initiate an obstruction of justice investigation based on what the president said?\u2019 It was a very clear question. Mr. Comey said \u2018I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t recall doing that so I don\u2019t think so.\u2019\n\n\u201cHowever, on page 13 of your IG report, it says that Comey purposefully leaked the memo so that they could have a special counsel appointed to investigate obstruction of justice. So two of those can not be true. They\u2019re at opposite dynamics in terms of what they\u2019re constructing. And we have dozens of examples where that has happened.\u201d\n\nMeadows added, \u201cSo we\u2019ll be referring those inconsistencies to you today, Mr. Horowitz, and I think that it\u2019s important that the American people get to look at this.\u201d\n\nObviously it could be a while before we hear the IG\u2019s reaction to that referral. In the meantime, Horowitz recently submitted a draft of his 18-month-long investigation into possible FISA Court abuse. That document will be marked for material that needs to be redacted at which point Horowitz\u2019 office will prepare a public version of the report for release. So probably sometime next month we could have a new, probably lengthy IG report to review.\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange that took place today between Meadows and Horowitz:", "description": "\"We'll be referring those inconsistencies to you today, Mr. Horowitz...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Horowitz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
