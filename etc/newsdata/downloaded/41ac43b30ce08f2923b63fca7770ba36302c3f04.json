He leaves behind a gift for Bosch: a murder book that highlights a cold case from almost 30 years ago.\n\nAt first glance the crime appears to be a simple drug deal gone wrong, but it was never resolved. Though he is officially retired, Bosch keeps busy working on cases, and he decides to take this one to his friend, Detective Renee Ballard, who works the night shift for the Los Angeles police department.\n\nThey made a promise to work together on cases when they can, and he feels this is one is worth pursuing since it was important enough for his former partner to have taken the case files with him when he retired.\n\nBallard lands a case in a homeless encampment that seems on the surface to be a simple accident where a man sleeping inside a tent knocked over a heater and burned to death. Looking over the evidence, she begins to realize something doesn\u2019t quite feel right.\n\nIn addition to these two cases, Bosch reluctantly agrees to assist his half-brother Mickey Haller with his defense of a client who left DNA behind at the murder scene.\n\nBallard wonders why Bosch would get involved but trusts him to do the right thing when it comes to justice.\n\nConnelly is the Raymond Chandler of this generation, and readers will be studying his writing methods decades from now.\n\nHe has created another novel that feels authentic on every level, and the underlying theme of mortality running through the narrative makes everything in the story more urgent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"The Night Fire,\" Little, Brown and Co., by Michael Connelly", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jeff Ayers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/book_review_-_the_night_fire_47188_c0-884-1848-1962_s1200x700.jpg?67898c29d2b77b480fb182179d6bc28301b1f1d4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
