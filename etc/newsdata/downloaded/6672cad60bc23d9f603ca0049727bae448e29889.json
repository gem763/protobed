Many analysts and politicians across have deemed that decision a blow to the U.S.-backed Kurds.\n\nBut CNN Turk paints a different picture for its audience.\n\n\u201cIn America, CNN tells you what people in Washington want to hear,\u201d Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Thursday. \u201cCNN Turk knows its audience, so they\u2019ve taken an entirely different line. They describe Turkey\u2019s military operation in Syria as \u2018a Peace Spring operation.\u2019\u201d\n\nFLASHBACK: WILL CNN PULL LICENSING RIGHTS FROM SHADY, PRO-DICTATOR NETWORK 'CNN TURK'?\n\nCarlson noted that CNN Turk regularly describes Kurdish militant groups as \"terrorists.\"\n\nCNN Turk's homepage, at the time of publication, featured a banner across the top with a link to on-air coverage. It was accompanied by the headline \"3 days in the Peace Spring Operation.\"\n\nTwo articles also appeared to refer to the local Kurdish militia, known as the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), as \"terrorists\".\n\nThe Turkish network made headlines last year after a reported $890 million deal shifted control of it and other key media outlets from the Dogan group, which paid CNN a license to independently operate the news network, to a conglomerate led by Erdogan Demiroren, an even stronger supporter of Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose repressive policies have shuttered or disrupted dozens of media operations in recent years.\n\nTURKEY'S SYRIA INVASION: MEMBER OF US SPECIAL FORCES SAYS, 'I AM ASHAMED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER'\n\nAt the time of the sale, Fox News asked one of CNN\u2019s highest-ranking executives about whether it would reconsider licensing its name to the Turkish network.\n\n\u201cWe will be meeting with the new owners in due course to discuss the implications of the sale.\u200e If, following those conversations, we have any reason whatsoever to believe the journalistic integrity of the channel could be compromised by the new owners, we will revoke the license,\u201d Allison Gollust, CNN\u2019s worldwide executive vice president and chief marketing officer, said in March 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGollust noted that CNN Turk operates as \u201ca wholly independent channel,\u201d and editorial decisions were not being made by CNN's stateside executives. However, the bio of CNN Executive Vice President Tony Maddow specifically says he \u201cis responsible for an international news and information portfolio that includes \u2026 CNN Turk.\u201d\n\nDemiroren, the namesake of the ownership group, is strongly pro-Erdogan, and reportedly once called the Turkish president his \u201cboss.\u201d He was even caught apologizing to Erdogan for a negative newspaper article, according to The New York Times. \u201cDemiroren was heard weeping, promising Mr. Erdogan that he would find the source,\u201d The Times reported.\n\nFox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight investigative producer Alex Pfeiffer contributed to this report.", "description": "CNN\u2019s stand-alone Turkish network CNN Turk, which has long been criticized for being a tool of Turkey\u2019s increasingly anti-American dictator,\u00a0is directly contradicting the narrative American CNN viewers are being fed.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
