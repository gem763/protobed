We're fighting two minute rounds which I think is totally embarrassing,' Gallen told Nine's Sports Sunday.\n\nGallen, 38, then fired another shot at his 42-year-old rival, saying he needed to 'man up' ahead of the match - dubbed the 'code war'.\n\n'Barry man up, let's fight three minute rounds and box properly. Man up!' he said.\n\nCronulla great Gallen retired from the NRL last month after 19 seasons but has fought nine times since making his debut in 2014 for nine victories - five by KO.\n\nThe 38-year-old, who is 5ft 11in, has been training the UK and has shared his preparations on social media.\n\nHe uploaded a training video of him with the caption: 'I hope ya training hard Barry because we'll be saying 'bye bye Barry' on the 15th.'\n\nThe two former footballers will get in the ring for a one-off heavyweight stoush dubbed the 'code war' at Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena on November 15\n\nGallen, who has nine amateur fights under his belt since retiring from the Cronulla Sharks, has also been hard at work (pictured)\n\nGallen admitted Hall was a formidable opponent but said he doubted whether he would be able to keep up with him in the ring.\n\n'He's already had 16 amateur fights which is more than me so he's going to know what he's doing,' Gallen said.\n\n'Guys who fight as amateurs get taught the basics of boxing and that's the most important thing and that will all come back to him.'\n\nBarry Hall (pictured with wife Lauren Brant) said he's feeling confident about the match despite dropping boxing at 16\n\nGallen (pictured with wife Anne) said Hall wouldn't be able to keep up with his pace in the ring\n\n'But I don't think he's going to be able to keep up with the pace I'm going to go at, he won't be able to cop it so once we get in there it's going to be a shock for him.'\n\nHall, 42, who dropped boxing when he was just 16 said he's feeling confident about the match.\n\n'A lot of people will say I'm too old but I know my body and I know what I'm capable of,' Hall said.\n\n'I'm very comfortable in the ring.'", "description": "The former Cronulla Sharks captain lashed out at Hall after he refused to fight for three minute rounds in their upcoming match at Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee", "Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20257588-0-image-a-5_1572214944508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
