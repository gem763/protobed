Renewable projects are also a lot less risky than upstream ones, even if financing them would require a lot higher leverage.\n\n\u201cClearly Chevron and Exxon and everybody have ambitions to be an energy major 30 or 40 or 50 years from now,\u201d Rystad told Bloomberg. \u201cCurrent energy majors are only 15% debt, but the future energy majors will be 85% debt. That\u2019s why it will change the capital structure of the industry.\u201d\n\nThere is one added benefit for Big Oil shareholders: large institutional investors such as pension funds and banks would be much happier with renewable investments. Just recently, Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund said it would divest $6 billion worth of interests in oil companies. Although the fund\u2019s reason for the decision was to reduce exposure to the volatility of the oil industry, other large investors are also pulling out\u2014or planning to pull out\u2014from oil and move to more sustainable industries.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Easier access to debt is expected to fuel the renewables boom, and big oil\u2019s shareholders are already looking forward to earnings from major bets on renewables", "authors": ["Irina Slav"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
