Part of the appeal was that it seemed ahead of its time \u2014 it could do things like show you notifications and help you control your phone\u2019s music, which would become table stakes for smartwatches made by other companies in the years to come.\n\nThe first Pebble seemed ahead of its time\n\nBut once the Apple Watch entered the market in 2015, it was game over for Pebble. The company was acquired by Fitbit in late 2016, and Fitbit eventually announced it would shut down Pebble\u2019s web services, which included an app store, voice dictation, weather, and more.\n\niFixit\u2019s story chronicles how the \u201cRebble Alliance,\u201d a group of dedicated Pebble fans, developers, and ex-employees, banded together to document and save as much about Pebble as they could so that they could rebuild what would otherwise be lost.\n\nAs the story explains, the Rebble Alliance has been incredibly successful. Among other things highlighted in the story, there\u2019s now a GitHub that preserves an incredible amount of technical information about the Pebble, web services (some with paid subscribers!) that replace much of what was shut down by Fitbit, and even aspirations of reverse-engineering Pebble\u2019s firmware to someday be able to build custom, Pebble-like smartwatches.\n\nIt\u2019s an great story \u2014 and you should go read it on iFixit.", "description": "The crowdfunded Pebble smartwatch officially died last June \u2014 but a group of dedicated Pebble fans are giving Pebbles second lives, as detailed in this great article on iFixit that you should go read.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fpu1GeWlXZVP0lAfI7YDKHV_tzw=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3729522/pebbletime2_2040.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
