Bill Flores, R-Texas, during a mock swearing in ceremony on Capitol Hill. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nOutside the Beltway\n\nTHEN THERE WERE 16: Two more Republican congressmen just announced plans to step down at the end of their terms, bringing the total number of GOP House members who have said they won't be seeking reelection in 2020 to a whopping 16.\n\nRep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) , who has served in Congress for 40 years, last night became the highest-ranking Republican to announce his retirement.\n\n, who has served in Congress for 40 years, last night became the highest-ranking Republican to announce his retirement. Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.) hours earlier became the fifth Republican from Texas to do so.\n\nWriting on the wall: The spate of retirements is a sign that enthusiasm is fading among Republicans about the prospects for taking back the House majority from Democrats next fall \u2014 and about the idea of spending another term in the minority.\n\n\u201cTo the extent Democrats can pick up a few \u2018insurance seats,\u2019\u201d The Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman told Power Up, \u201cit makes it a lot harder for Republicans to take control.\u201d\n\nThe Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman told Power Up, While Flores and Sensenbrenner are in relatively safe districts for Republicans, Wasserman pointed to three Texas seats of exiting Republican Reps. Will Hurd, Kenny Marchant and Pete Olson that are in increasingly competitive districts that the GOP incumbents won by slim margins in 2018.\n\nOn the flip side: Only four House Democrats are voluntarily heading for the exits in 2020. California Rep. Susan A. Davis, in a safely Democratic district, was the latest to announce her departure last night.\n\nHistoric?: Analysts are closely watching the exit rate to see if 2020 might surpass last cycle's historic number of what FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich tallied as 39 open Republican seats and \u201c26 pure Republican retirements \u2026 the fifth-biggest exodus of any party in any election going back to 1974.\u201d\n\nTexodus: \u201cSo far, 22 percent of Texas's Republicans are leaving and that number could rise before the December filing deadline,\u201d Wasserman tells us. \u201cIf that 'Texodus' percentage were applied to the whole country, we'd be on track for 43 Republican open seats, surpassing 2018's historic number.\u201d\n\nThe minority factor: The Texodus is largely made up of members who once held subcommittee chairmanships \u2014 and whose power has already been checked by being in the minority.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, you had a lot of chairman who became ranking members \u2014 and even then there are term limits for how long they can serve,\u201d Dave Carney, a GOP strategist who has advised Texas pols for over 20 years, told Power Up. \u201cAnd being a minority member is just you sitting on the backbench and it's not as entertaining and engaging and fun. So Texas is a victim of having so many subcommittee chairmen.\u201d\n\nDave Carney, a GOP strategist who has advised Texas pols for over 20 years, told Power Up. \u201cAnd being a minority member is just you sitting on the backbench and it's not as entertaining and engaging and fun. So Texas is a victim of having so many subcommittee chairmen.\u201d That list of ex-panel leaders includes Rep. Michael Conaway, the former House Agriculture Committee chairman, and Flores, a former chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee. Hurd, as another example, chaired the House Oversight panel's Information Technology subcommittee.\n\n\u201cMost House Republicans didn't have any idea what serving in the minority is like before 2019,\u201d Wasserman told Power Up. \u201cBill Flores, for example, came into the House in the GOP wave of 2010. So it's not surprising we're on pace for a lot of Republican retirements.\u201d\n\nHistory, duh: It's a dynamic that history has seen before. \u201cAfter Democrats in 2006 won back the House majority for the first time in a dozen years, Republicans saw a high number of retirements in the following term. The departures helped Democrats pick up even more seats in the 2008 election,\u201d The Atlantic's Russell Berman reports.\n\nGOP retirements are going to be problem for the party this cycle, but the Sensenbrenner news is more of a reflection of how miserable it can be in the minority than anything else. \u2014 Doug Heye (@DougHeye) September 4, 2019\n\nThen there's the Trump factor: Hurd, the lone black Republican in the House, referenced Trump's racist tweets that said four congresswomen of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to their ancestral countries in his exit interview with my colleague Bob Moore in August. \u201cWhen you imply that because someone doesn\u2019t look like you, in telling them to go back to Africa or wherever, you\u2019re implying that they\u2019re not an American, and you\u2019re implying that they have less worth than you,\u201d Hurd said.\n\nWhat this matters for the party: \u201cHurd represents the exact kind of district Republicans need to hold on to or win to retake the majority in 2020. His border district is 70 percent Hispanic; it\u2019s a battleground district in a state that has the potential to become a battleground state,\u201d our colleague Amber Philips wrote earlier this month.\n\n\u201cHurd represents the exact kind of district Republicans need to hold on to or win to retake the majority in 2020. His border district is 70 percent Hispanic; it\u2019s a battleground district in a state that has the potential to become a battleground state,\u201d our colleague Amber Philips wrote earlier this month. There's also the daily Trump grind: \u201cDay after day, members walk to the U.S. House chamber to cast votes. And day after day, reporters swarm these members to answer for the latest Trump tweet or policy change,\u201d the Texas Tribune's Abby Livingston reports. \u201cMarchant, Olson and Hurd, who were already in tough reelection races, have also faced exceedingly angry constituents, eager political trackers following them around with video cameras to catch any misstep and opposition researchers digging into their backgrounds looking for anything that could be used against them.\u201d\n\nMore to come post-recess?: As our colleague Paul Kane wrote at the end of July, there's an \u201cunspoken fear among Republicans \u2026 that more retirements could be on the way, particularly over this long recess as members of Congress spend time with their families, travel their district or make official overseas trips.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat time away helps lawmakers recharge and come back to Washington ready for the fall and winter legislative slog \u2014 or realize how much they enjoyed their time away from the Capitol, prompting them to prepare their retirement announcements,\u201d P.K. added.\n\nP.K. added. Silver linings?: Some strategists argue, however, that the loss of some older and less diverse members could present an opportunity for House Republicans to recruit new and perhaps more exciting talent.\n\nSome strategists argue, however, that the loss of some older and less diverse members could present an opportunity for House Republicans to recruit new and perhaps more exciting talent. \u201cI think fresh blood with new ideas and fresh energy is not in and of itself a bad thing,\u201d Carney told us. \u201cSometimes these guys were mailing it in \u2026 You take things for granted when you\u2019re not a challenger.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAt The White House\n\nTRUMP DISPLAYS DOCTORED DORIAN CHART: \u201cOn Wednesday, it appears the White House attempted to retroactively justify a tweet that President Trump issued over the weekend in which he warned, erroneously, that Alabama would be affected by Hurricane Dorian,\u201d our colleagues Matthew Cappucci and Andrew Freedman report.\n\nWhat happened: \u201cIn a White House video released Wednesday, Trump displays a modified National Hurricane Center 'cone of uncertainty' forecast, dated from 11 a.m. on Aug. 29, indicating Alabama would in fact be affected,\u201d Matthew and Andrew write. \u201cThe graphic appears to have been altered with a Sharpie to indicate a risk the storm would move into Alabama from Florida.\u201d A White House official later confirmed a drawing was made using a black Sharpie.\n\n\u201cIn a White House video released Wednesday, Trump displays a modified National Hurricane Center 'cone of uncertainty' forecast, dated from 11 a.m. on Aug. 29, indicating Alabama would in fact be affected,\u201d Matthew and Andrew write. \u201cThe graphic appears to have been altered with a Sharpie to indicate a risk the storm would move into Alabama from Florida.\u201d A White House official later confirmed a drawing was made using a black Sharpie.

(Erin Schaff/The New York Times/Pool)\n\nTRUMP BACKS JOHNSON AMID BREXIT CHAOS: \"Trump stuck by embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday, offering encouragement for the fight to take Britain out of the European Union as the political turmoil in Great Britain complicated a week of European diplomacy for Vice President Pence,\" our colleagues Anne Gearan and Robert Costa report.\n\n'Boris knows how to win': \"He\u2019s a friend of mine, and he\u2019s going at it, there\u2019s no question about it,' Trump said, noting that he had watched Johnson on television earlier in the day. 'Boris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s a friend of mine, and he\u2019s going at it, there\u2019s no question about it,' Trump said, noting that he had watched Johnson on television earlier in the day. 'Boris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him.\" The same boat: \"If Johnson is unable to deliver Brexit on time, or at all, or if he is ousted as prime minister, his rise and fall will be tied to Trump. The president has been willing to look past policy disagreements with Johnson on Iran, climate change and trade protectionism chiefly because of Johnson\u2019s Trump-like rhetoric about the importance of shedding E.U. control, analysts said,\" Anne and Bob write.\n\nThe Guardian front page, Thursday 5 September 2019: Cornered Johnson suffers triple Commons defeat pic.twitter.com/4Rw5SqwTkd \u2014 The Guardian (@guardian) September 4, 2019\n\nGlobal Power\n\nBORIS IS HAVING A \u2018VERY, VERY BAD WEEK\u2019: \"Johnson has lost his majority in Parliament just weeks into his term, and British lawmakers are in revolt over Johnson\u2019s 'do or die' plan to effect Brexit by the end of next month,\" as Anne and Bob note. \"His government in chaos, Johnson failed Wednesday in his effort to call a new election on Oct. 15.\"\n\nSo Power Up got a fill straight from our London bureau. Here's what our colleague Kevin Sullivan says about what some analysts are calling the \u201cshortest political honeymoon in British history.\u201d\n\nBrexit has always been dramatic but Johnson has added a new wrinkle: \u201cBy now we\u2019re used to all the Brexit arguments \u2014 either the sky is falling, or the sky will never be a more beautiful blue, depending on your tribe. But introducing Boris Johnson into the mix has given it all a new flavor. The man long dubbed 'Blond Ambition' has been prime minister for six weeks, but he hasn\u2019t really had to deal with Parliament until members returned from summer break this week. And what a homecoming it was,\" Kevin tells us.\n\n\u201cBy now we\u2019re used to all the Brexit arguments \u2014 either the sky is falling, or the sky will never be a more beautiful blue, depending on your tribe.

And what a homecoming it was,\" Kevin tells us. Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament before Oct. 31 only added fuel to the fire: \u201cIt was a \u2018coup,\u2019 and \u2018assault on democracy\u2019 or any number of nasty things \u2014 which everyone agreed was Vintage Boris, and not anything Theresa May would have thought of in her wildest dreams, if she has those. So we have protesters in the street dressed in Boris masks, swarming 10 Downing Street wrapped in E.U. flags and carrying [expletive-filled signs about] Boris. It\u2019s Brexit, but it just as much Boris, that has brought the marchers to the streets.\"\n\n\u201cIt was a \u2018coup,\u2019 and \u2018assault on democracy\u2019 or any number of nasty things \u2014 which everyone agreed was Vintage Boris, and not anything Theresa May would have thought of in her wildest dreams, if she has those.

The weather has been sunny all week, but it\u2019s been nothing but storms on the airwaves. It\u2019s too soon to know how this all plays out for Boris, let alone Brexit.\"\n\n\u201cSome are thrilled, some are despondent, some just wish the whole thing would stop taking up every blessed second of airtime on every TV news show.
