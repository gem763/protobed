We want action.\u201d\n\nThe Friday event, which drew more than 250,000 to lower Manhattan, was the first of two demonstrations bookending the United Nations General Assembly. A second strike is set for Sept. 27.\n\nBut Prakash, whose group\u2019s protests have propelled the Green New Deal into the political mainstream and helped shape the 2020 Democratic primary debate, said the movement is preparing a set of demands that go far beyond simply rejoining the Paris Agreement\u2019s targets for cutting planet-heating emissions.\n\nComparing rhetorical shows of support like former President Barack Obama\u2019s call for \u201caction\u201d to the empty public statements politicians and corporations routinely release on Earth Day, Prakash said the demonstrators sought to conjure the original 1970 march that pressured then-President Richard Nixon to pass bedrock regulations and create the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThis escalation of the stakes started earlier this week, when teenage climate strikers admonished lawmakers at a congressional hearing.\n\nGreta Thunberg, the Swedish 16-year-old who founded the strike movement last year, dispensed with legislators\u2019 praise. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to listen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to listen to the scientists.\u201d\n\nJamie Margolin, the 17-year-old from Seattle who founded the nonprofit Zero Hour, called delaying U.S. action \u201cshameful and cowardly.\u201d\n\nThunberg and Margolin coined the term \u201cGen GND\u201d \u2015 Generation Green New Deal \u2015 this week, suggesting that the movement would rally around the proposal for a sweeping industrial policy to dramatically reduce emissions by 2030, dismantle the fossil fuel industry and provide millions of secure jobs.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be afraid to politicize the issue,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need empty words of support.\u201d\n\nThe Sunrise Movement cut its teeth in 2018 campaigning for many of the left-leaning Democrats who are vocal advocates for the Green New Deal now that they\u2019re in office. In February, a 16-year-old campaigner with the group confronted Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in a heated protest at her office, a video of which went viral.\n\n\u201cWe have to go to war with the wealthiest and most powerful people and industries in the history of the world, and we have to win,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cIt could get ugly.\u201d\n\nFor some, it already is. When billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer showed up to Friday\u2019s march in Washington, D.C., strikers booed him and chanted, according to a New York Times reporter, \u201cstop running for president\u201d and \u201cyou represent corporate greed.\u201d Roughly 1,600 Amazon employees were scheduled to walk off the job on Friday to protest the company\u2019s ties to fossil fuel companies and failure to do more on climate change. In a particularly stark example, protesters in New York demonstrated outside a Santander office demanding the bank forgive debt owed by Puerto Rico on the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Mar\u00eda.\n\nPicket signs at marches across the U.S. included calls to prosecute executives at Exxon Mobil Corp. and other oil giants whose leaked internal documents showed they understood the dangers of climate change even as the company spent millions promoting disinformation about the threat.\n\nIn a telling sign, the Twitter accounts of most of the big oil companies were mostly silent on Friday.", "description": "Tired of empty words and emissions targets without plans to meet them, the strike movement is coalescing behind a Green New Deal.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d853a882100005d00d512c6.jpeg?cache=mr8ekue268&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
