Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law this month that further encourages their construction.\n\nLarger, multiroom ADUs built from the ground up are also a part of efforts to contend with the housing crisis, but Mr. Dietz, a longtime venture capitalist who invested in Costco and Starbucks and has taught a class on entrepreneurship at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business, took inspiration from the new laws to focus on a garage-based solution \u2014 with research help from his students at U.S.C.\n\nHis idea is simple: United Dwelling enters a partnership with a homeowner, pays for the garage conversion, manages the rental of the apartment to a qualified applicant and splits the rent with the homeowner.\n\nSince most of the detached garages in Los Angeles aren\u2019t used for cars \u2014 91 percent of the 2,100 homeowners surveyed by Mr. Dietz\u2019s students use their garages for something else, mostly storage \u2014 this can provide rental income and affordable housing in many neighborhoods. And it does it by using existing structures.", "description": "Converting some of Los Angeles County\u2019s 250,000 detached garages into apartments could address multiple problems.", "authors": ["Bonnie Tsui"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/realestate/19real-LAflats02-inyt/19real-LAflats02-inyt-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
