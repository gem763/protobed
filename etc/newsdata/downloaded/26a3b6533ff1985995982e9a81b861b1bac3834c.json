Returns come in two forms \u2013 appreciation, the gains share price that strong stocks will show, and dividends, the profit-sharing payments companies make to shareholders. Today, we\u2019ll be looking at four tech stocks that show a winning combination of both. These are the names that will bring you a return, no matter what the upside may be.\n\nTo find these stocks, we\u2019ve used the TipRanks' Stock Screener tool. The Screener is chock full of filters to make your market research simple. You can sort companies by market cap, average price target, investor sentiment, or market sector. Or, you can do what we did \u2013 sort out the stocks with high dividend yields and Buy ratings from the analyst consensus. Let\u2019s take a look at our market stalwarts for strong returns.\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nThe first stock on our list is one of the market\u2019s most venerable names, AT&T. The largest descendant of the old Bell system, AT&T is still the largest landline provider in the US, as well as world\u2019s largest telecom company and mobile provider. The company does over $170 billion worth of business annually, realizing a net profit on the order of $19.9 billion. T stock is up over 34% year-to-date, outstripping the NASDAQ\u2019s 25% gains.\n\nOn the red side of the ledger, AT&T is held down by a massive $160 billion debt load. The company purchased Time Warner last year, for $85 billion, in a move to gain a proven content provider as it prepares to enter the streaming space. In recent weeks, AT&T has started divesting itself of lesser stakes in Europe, using the proceeds to work down the debt.\n\nAT&T has a long-standing policy of returning profits to shareholders regardless of market performance. Management has consistently raised the dividend for the last 16 years, and the yield is now a healthy 5.5%, giving an annualized payout of $2.04 per share. This is income on top of the strong appreciation noted above.\n\nAT&T has just reported mixed earnings for Q3, showing 94 cents per share against a forecast of 93 cents. This marked a 4.4% gain from the year-ago quarter. The earnings beat came even as revenues were down slightly, with the $44.59 billion just under the year-ago figure of $45.74 billion.\n\nNomura\u2019s 4-star analyst Jeff Kvaal sees AT&T\u2019s current situation as strong. His prediction of Q3 earnings being \u201cmore positive than not\u201d was vindicated, and he says, \u201cAT&T's reticence to match Verizon's price cut implies confidence in wireless\u2026\u201d Kvaal sets a $43 target on T, for an 11% upside. (To watch Kvaal's track record, click here)\n\nOverall, T\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus comes from 10 \"buy\" and 6 \"hold\" ratings. The stock trades for $38; the average price target of $38.92 suggests a modest 4% upside. (See AT&T stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nSecond spot on our list goes to Verizon, the second-place telecom giant. With 153 million mobile subscribers, Verizon is second to AT&T in the US wireless market. It is also second in revenue, with $130.86 annually making it the second-largest telecom company in the world. Version sees a net income of $15.5 billion.\n\nDespite its second-place status, VZ just reported firmer earnings than AT&T. Verizon beat both the EPS and revenue forecasts. The $1.25 EPS was just ahead of the $1.24 expected, while the $32.84 quarterly revenues were a half-percentage higher than the estimates. Sales revenues were in-line with the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues", "description": "You\u2019re in the investment markets to make money, and that means you\u2019ll be looking for stocks with a strong return.
