Barr of having \u201cgone rogue\u201d and said she\u2019s praying for God to \u201cilluminate\u201d Trump.\n\nThe fallout from a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky played out on Twitter and television Friday, as the number of Democrats supporting the impeachment inquiry launched by Pelosi continued to grow.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials had signed a statement supporting an impeachment inquiry based on Trump\u2019s pressing Zelensky during their call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u25cf Effort to shield Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian leader was part of broader secrecy effort\n\n\u25cf Democrats eye quick impeachment probe of Trump as freshmen push for focus on Ukraine\n\n\u25cf Who\u2019s who in the whistleblower complaint\n\nThe whistleblower complaint | Official readout: Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky\n\n10 a.m.: Oregon congressman accuses Trump of \u2018treason\u2019\n\nRep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), speaking on the House floor Friday morning, accused Trump of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nDeFazio referred to remarks Trump made at a private event where the president said the whistleblower\u2019s actions were akin to being a spy or committing treason.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see: Russia has invaded the Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his political opponent,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cHe\u2019s jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States. If anybody is committing treason \u2014 and I believe that\u2019s an impeachable offense \u2014 it\u2019s the president of the United States, Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker presiding over the House reminded DeFazio not to engage in personal attacks against the president in the House chamber.\n\nA little later, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said DeFazio crossed the line and asked that the Democrat be reminded that \u201csuch violation won\u2019t be tolerated in the future.\u201d\n\n9:45 a.m.: Trump speculates \u2018a leaker or a spy\u2019 fed information to whistleblower\n\nTrump speculated on Twitter on Friday morning that the whistleblower might have received information from \u201ca leaker or spy\u201d or a \u201cpartisan operative.\u201d He offered no evidence for his suggestions.\n\n\u201cSounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn\u2019t a Whistleblower at all,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cIn addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the whistleblower complaint wasn\u2019t written by the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cLook at the phraseology, the endnotes and the footnotes,\u201d Sekulow said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm.\u201d\n\n9:30 a.m.: Trump returns to Twitter, calls Schiff a \u2018sick man\u2019\n\nTrump fired off a series of mid-morning tweets, once again claiming his conversation with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and taking aim again at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cIT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!\u201d Trump said in one tweet written in all capital letters.\n\nShortly afterward, he renewed his call from earlier Friday for Schiff to resign for what Trump contended was embellishing Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky during remarks during a hearing Thursday hearing with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cHe must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!\u201d\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s hearing, Schiff explained that his summary of Trump\u2019s call \u201cwas meant to be at least part in parody.\u201d\n\nIn his mid-morning tweets, Trump also declared that, \u201cThe Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!\u201d\n\n9 a.m. Schiff responds to Trump\u2019s call for his resignation\n\nSchiff took to Twitter on Friday morning to respond to Trump\u2019s call for him to resign for offering an embellished account of Trump\u2019s phone conversation with Zelensky during Thursday\u2019s House Intelligence Committee hearing.\n\n\u201cYou engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country. And then you tried to cover it up,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cBut you\u2019re right about one thing \u2014 your words need no mockery. Your own words and deeds mock themselves. But most importantly here, they endanger our country.\u201d\n\nSchiff said Thursday that his recounting of the Trump-Zelensky call was intended partly as parody, which Schiff said should have been obvious.\n\n9 a.m.: Talk continues about Flake\u2019s claim on GOP impeachment votes\n\nBuzz continued on social media Friday about a claim made the day before by former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) that at least 35 Republican senators would privately vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nFlake, a frequent critic of Trump, offered his assessment Thursday at the Texas Tribune Festival.\n\n\u201cI heard someone say if there were a private vote there would be 30 Republican votes. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Flake said during a question-and-answer session. \u201cThere would be at least 35.\u201d\n\nA Senate vote at any impeachment trial would be public.\n\n8:30 a.m.: New Yorker cover shows Trump and Giuliani killing Uncle Sam\n\nThe New Yorker revealed its cover art for next week\u2019s magazine, which depicts Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani as mobsters throwing Uncle Sam off a bridge to his death.\n\nAn early look at next week\u2019s cover, \"Whack Job,\" by Barry Blitt. https://t.co/BeqIKP0Xwh pic.twitter.com/CyFUGQxGxO \u2014 The New Yorker (@NewYorker) September 27, 2019\n\n8 a.m.: Pelosi says she prays for Trump, asks that \u2018God will illuminate him\u2019\n\nDuring a morning television appearance, Pelosi said she is praying for Trump and accused Barr of have \u201cgone rogue\u201d in his handling of the fallout from Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\nIn the midst of a discussion about her decision to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, Pelosi said: \u201cI pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong. It\u2019s very problematic.\u201d\n\nAt other points during her appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Pelosi also accused Trump of \u201cbeing disloyal to the oath of his office\u201d and having used taxpayer dollars to \u201cshake down\u201d Zelensky.\n\nPelosi was referring to the fact that Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine at the time of the phone conversation with Zelensky, in which he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that there was \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Pelosi was also highly critical of Barr\u2019s handling of the episode.\n\nBarr\u2019s Justice Department played a central role in holding up the disclosure of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nAs acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday, he consulted the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which overruled the inspector general\u2019s determination that the complaint was of \u201curgent concern,\u201d a legal threshold that would have required disclosure to Congress within seven days.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone rogue,\u201d Pelosi said of Barr, adding: \u201cI think where they\u2019re going is a coverup of the coverup.\u201d\n\n7:45 a.m.: Trump calls on Schiff to \u2018resign immediately\u2019\n\nTrump on Friday called on Schiff to \u201cimmediately resign\u201d following Thursday\u2019s hearing in which the House Intelligence Committee chairman offered an embellished account of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cHe was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHe has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!\u201d\n\nSchiff explained later in the hearing what he had done.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least part in parody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Pelosi said she was \u201cso proud of Adam Schiff\u201d for his handling of the hearing but did not allude to the episode in question.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Trump takes swipes at the media in morning tweets\n\nTrump took multiple swipes at the media in morning tweets, including complaining about punctuation used in a CNN report that mentioned a derogatory term he used for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, misspelling describing. \u201cLow ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!\u201d\n\nTrump in fact used an apostrophe, not a hyphen.\n\nIn another tweet, he took issue with a story by Peter Baker of the New York Times and declared that he \u201cshould not even be allowed to write about me.\u201d\n\n7 a.m.: White House spokesman decries those who gave information to whistleblower\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley denounced leaks coming from the White House, calling them \u201cdangerous,\u201d and questioned the motives of those who provided information to the whistleblower.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Gidley was asked about Trump\u2019s remarks Thursday morning to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in which he dismissed the complaint against him from the intelligence community whistleblower and suggested that the person\u2019s actions made him or her \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was talking about the people who actually gave the information to the whistleblower,\u201d Gidley claimed.\n\nThe whistleblower said the complaint was based on information from more than a half dozen U.S. officials.\n\nGidley noted that transcripts of previous Trump calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico had also been leaked to the press.\n\n\u201cThese leaks are dangerous,\u201d he said, adding that he was not sure why they have happened.\n\n\u201cDo they just want to bolster their own careers or get invited to the cocktail parties here in D.C.?\u201d he asked.\n\nDuring the same interview, Gidley insisted that no one in the White House is concerned about the revelations in the whistleblower report.\n\n\u201cNo one I\u2019ve talked to is concerned at all about this because there is nothing there,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in the White House is concerned about this because the president has done nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n6:45 a.m.: Democrats rip Trump\u2019s \u2018threatening\u2019 comments against whistleblower\n\nSomeone laughed loudly during the closed-door speech President Trump gave at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday. Other voices spoke in hushed murmurs.\n\nTrump had just demanded to know who provided a whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian president, describing that person as \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and adding: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, which were included in leaked video obtained by The Washington Post and others, have sparked intense backlash, with top Democrats decrying his words as \u201cthreatening\u201d and defending the whistleblower at the center of a new push for impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe sounds like a criminal,\u201d Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential primary candidate, told MSNBC on Thursday night. \u201c\u2018Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let\u2019s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there\u2019s a consequence and it\u2019s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Allyson Chiu\n\n6:30 a.m.: Nearly 300 former officials call Trump\u2019s actions concerning Ukraine \u2018profound national security concern\u2019\n\nNearly 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials have signed a statement warning that Trump\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine are a \u201cprofound national security concern\u201d and supporting an impeachment inquiry by Congress to determine \u201cthe facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress\u2019 deliberative process,\u201d said the statement, released Friday. \u201cAt the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe collection of signatures was set in motion by National Security Action, an organization founded and largely populated by officials from the Obama administration to call attention to Trump\u2019s \u201creckless leadership.\u201d\n\nMany of the signers are former Obama officials. But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Matthew Olsen, head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division under President George W. Bush and director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Barack Obama.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karen DeYoung\n\n6 a.m.: \u2018Enough is enough with this guy,\u2019 says Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nEchoing other Democratic White House hopefuls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lambasted Trump during an appearance Thursday night on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d during which he also called the president a \u201cspoiled brat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country,\u201d Sanders said, prompting applause from the studio audience. \u201cI think this Ukrainian business \u2014 using national security money designed to protect the people of America and use that as leverage to try to get dirt on a political opponent, and then trying to cover that up \u2014 this is an outrage on top of an outrage. And I think this is kind of taking millions of people to say, \u2018You know what? Enough is enough with this guy. \u2019 \u201d\n\nSanders went on to say that he doesn\u2019t think Trump \u201cknows the difference between lying and truth-telling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt very much that he understands what the Constitution of the United States of America is about,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he understands that we have an emoluments clause which says you cannot enrich yourself when you\u2019re president. I don\u2019t know that he understands that. He grew up as a very rich kid. I think he\u2019s a spoiled brat, and I think he thinks he can do anything that he wants to do.\u201d", "description": "Fallout continued Friday from an explosive whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July phone call with the leader of Ukraine.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3IMBTSX9wba-BCpQcaf4Z6zEZ0g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WUOCP2XBEII6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
