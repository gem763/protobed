The NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan became the first American woman to do so later the same year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right now on television all over the world, so don\u2019t get nervous,\u201d Trump added.\n\nHe paused for five seconds, then started to ask a question as one of the astronauts began responding to his initial comments. An aide explained to the president that there was \u201cabout a four- or five-second delay.\u201d\n\nWhen the astronauts got the chance to respond, Meir politely corrected President Trump.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us,\u201d Meir, who was doing her first-ever spacewalk, said. \u201cThis is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time, and it\u2019s really interesting for us. We\u2019ve talked a lot about it up here, you know, for us, this is really just us doing our jobs. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been training for for six years.\u201d\n\nSpace.com shared the video of the call (below) on its Youtube channel.\n\nMeir continued: \u201cWe do, of course, want to give credit to all of those that came before us. There has been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers, and astronauts, and we have followed in their footsteps to get us where we are today. We hope that we can provide an inspiration to everybody, not only women, but to everybody that has a dream, that has a big dream and is willing to work hard to make that dream come true.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Christina Koch and Jessica Meir paused their important work on the space station to politely correct the president.
