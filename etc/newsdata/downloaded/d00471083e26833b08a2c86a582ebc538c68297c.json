Prices are below the declining 50-day simple moving average line. The rising 200-day moving average line is below the market but prices are not extended above it as they were in late August.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line declined with prices and it has recently stabilized signaling a shift away from aggressive selling.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the upside from below the zero line giving us a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SHOP, below, we can see that prices have corrected just some of its rally from around $125 to over $400.\n\nPrices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line but the weekly OBV line has turned down and so has the MACD oscillator. Because we are using weekly information any signals about a turn to the upside are likely to be late.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SHOP, below, we can see an upside price target of $349 or so.\n\nBottom line strategy: As long as SHOP stays above $299.87 (use this as a sell stop) it looks like the long side of SHOP is attractive.", "description": "Can we see a good risk/reward trade set up?...SHOP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Shopify Needs To Stay Above", "To Remain Attractive On The Charts", "Can We See A Good Risk Reward Trade Set Up", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/79726b0f-d3df-11e9-822b-d70b6cfd030b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
