A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jack Leach - 5 Will forever rue the front-foot no-ball that cost England the best part of 100 runs from Steve Smith's bat, but plugged away and turned in another diligent tail-end defence.

England are losing an Ashes series and he\u2019s only taken eight wickets at 30 in three Test matches.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s troubled anyone. It just annoys me.\u201d\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the third Test, a video emerged of Leach re-enacting his single run with his England teammates on the pitch in Leeds.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m not saying that you don\u2019t do these things,\u201d Pietersen said. \u201cIt can be good for team spirit to have a bit of fun, but from my side, I want to win.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see the crowd about how funny he is. I want to see him winning matches for England with his bowling.\n\n\u201cWhen we beat Australia, Graeme Swann took big wickets for us. For Australia, Shane Warne and now Nathan Lyon take big wickets.\n\n\u201cWe had Monty Panesar. But Monty, who everybody laughed at when he fielded the ball, knocked over the likes of [Sachin] Tendulkar and [Virender] Sehwag, [and] got big Australian wickets.\n\n\u201cWhen we beat India in India, he and Swann bowled beautifully. Yes, some people laughed, but he was still doing his job. Jack Leach isn\u2019t doing his job.\n\n\u201cSo what does he want to be remembered as? Does he want to be remembered as this funny guy who can hold a bat, or as a match-winner for England?\u201d\n\nThe final Ashes Test of this year\u2019s series starts at The Oval on Thursday, and Leach has been named in an unchanged England squad.", "description": "Former England Cricket Team batsman Kevin Pietersen has criticised spin bowler Jack Leach for becoming a \u201claughing stock\u201d.", "authors": ["Alex Pattle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/15/13/Jack-Leach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
