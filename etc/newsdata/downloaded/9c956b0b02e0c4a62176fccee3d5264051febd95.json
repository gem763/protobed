REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo\n\nWith the sound of seagulls as a backdrop, Moura unveiled designs that reflected the fishermen\u2019s work and lifestyle in the line called \u201cGadidae\u201d, the name given to the family of codfish.\n\nSquare jackets were matched to cargo shorts or cropped wide-leg trousers and, like dark-coloured dresses and skirts in the Spring/Summer 2020 collection, were adorned in pockets and zips giving a practical feel to the clothes.\n\nSome dresses had small detachable pouches on them.\n\nThere were also anoraks in block colours and two-tone denim jacket and short combinations, and the odd gingham print.\n\nDresses came in floral tapestry-like prints, reminiscent of the carpets hanging outside fishermen\u2019s homes, show notes read, where the codfish, a Portuguese culinary speciality, usually dry out in the sun.\n\nOther dresses were white and in lighter cotton and linen, with unfinished hems, or black and see-through. One see-through evening coat appeared as a lighter version of a nautical jacket.\n\n\u201cThis collection is driven by the contrast between different fishing techniques and its people throughout the 20th century,\u201d the show notes read.\n\n\u201cInfluences of working clothes\u2019 utilitarian details and the fishermen\u2019s everyday clothes counteract today\u2019s oversized fitting and sportswear clothes.\u201d\n\nMoura used a colour palette of mainly cobalt and dark blue, black, orange, red and dark earthy tones. Footwear consisted of trainers that were given a worn feel, and one bag came fish-shaped.\n\nMilan Fashion Week was the third leg of the month-long Spring/Summer 2020 womenswear catwalk calendar that began in New York and also includes London and Paris.\n\nThe six-day event, where the likes of Italian fashion power houses Prada, Giorgio Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Versace presented their latest designs on the runway, also included the Green Carpet Fashion Awards on Sunday night.\n\nThe awards are aimed at promoting environmental sustainability in the fashion industry, where an increasing number of brands are seeking to improve their green credentials amid more ecologically aware consumers.\n\nWinners included veteran Italian designer Valentino Garavani, 87, who was given the Legacy Award while British designer Stella McCartney, who is known for her animal-friendly fashion ethics, received the Groundbreaker Award.\n\nFashionistas now head to Paris, the last stop for this season.", "description": "Portuguese designer Alexandra Moura closed Milan Fashion Week on Monday with a tribute to her country's cod fishermen, presenting a spring collection for women and men inspired by the sea.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432942630&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0YO-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
