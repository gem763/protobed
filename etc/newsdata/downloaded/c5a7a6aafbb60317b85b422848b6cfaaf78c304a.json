(PFPT) a \"winner.\"\n\n\"They're doing a good job,\" said Cramer to a caller during the show's \"Lightning Round.\" Let's check out the charts to see what they can add to the conversation.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of PFPT, below, we can see that prices have been in an uptrend the past eleven months. This uptrend does not lend itself to a simple or easy trend line with a straight edge.\n\nPrices do make higher highs and higher lows, which is the simple definition of an uptrend. Prices are currently below the rising 50-day and the rising 200-day moving averages, but that could change with a rally. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been positive the entire calendar year. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is currently in negative territory, below the zero-line, but narrowing toward an eventual cover-shorts, buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of PFPT, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices are just below the 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been generally positive for several months and more recently the past two months. The MACD oscillator is still above the zero-line, but in a take-profits mode.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of PFPT, below, we can see an upside price target of $175.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts of PFPT are not clearly bullish, but the overall pattern of prices and the Point and Figure chart suggest that we should be positive. Be patient and approach from the long side. A close below $105 would tell us our analysis was wrong.", "description": "The charts of PFPT are not clearly bullish, but outlook is overall positive, so be patient and approach from the long side....PFPT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Burden Of Proofpoint", "Rally Is Likely", "But It Will Take Time", "The Charts Of Pfpt Are Not Clearly Bullish", "But Outlook Is Overall Positive", "So Be Patient", "Approach The Long Side.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d5a29b97-d88e-11e9-848d-911f27c0192d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
