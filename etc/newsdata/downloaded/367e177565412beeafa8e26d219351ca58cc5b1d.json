The metro line in the area was also closed as were schools and businesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve calculated that the fire is moving at a rate of 800 acres per hour,\u201d Terrazas said, adding that it would probably take days to get it under control.\n\nSome 200 firefighters were meanwhile battling several other blazes in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, including one that tore through a trailer park and was started by burning trash.\n\nThat blaze, dubbed the Sandalwood fire, destroyed 76 homes and buildings and killed an 89-year-old woman who was unable to escape the flames.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, but authorities ordered several hundred homes in the area be evacuated.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Gusting winds fueling a fast-moving wildfire in southern California showed no signs of abating Saturday as a blaze that forced", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/8ec5cd_firefighter-walks-flames-saddleridge-in-southern-california-southern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
