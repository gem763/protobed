The Missouri High School Activities Association told the newspaper it had accepted Cardinal Ritter\u2019s self-imposed sanctions over the issue.\n\nNEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ACQUIRE MOHAMED SANU FROM ATLANTA FALCONS: REPORT\n\nCardinal Ritter self-reported the use of an ineligible player to the state\u2019s high school sports governing body Tuesday, according to the Post-Dispatch. The issue stems from the school using a player who was supposed to be suspended for the first game of the season but played anyway using a different name.\n\nJunior Bill Jackson, who was ejected from the 2018 Class 3 state championship game, was set to be suspended for the team\u2019s first game of the 2019 season. However, a player, who later was identified as Jackson, appeared in a No. 24 jersey for the team\u2019s first game. For the charade, the player was identified during the contest as freshman Marvin Burks. The next week, Jackson was back on the field, but this time with his own name and wearing his normal jersey.\n\nJackson\u2019s unique tattoos apparently gave away the scam.\n\nGregory had spoken to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch after Jackson \"returned\" in Week 2 and rushed for 147 yards.\n\nURBAN MEYER SPARKS SPECULATION ABOUT HIS INTEREST IN DALLAS COWBOYS HEAD COACHING JOB\n\n\u201cHe earned it, he deserved it. It was his time to play ball,\u201d Gregory said.\n\nCardinal Ritter also \u201cpermanently released\u201d the entire coaching staff of the football team, and the school\u2019s athletic director, Preston Thomas, made the \u201cdecision to retire.\u201d\n\nGregory told KMOV-TV on Friday he thought Jackson sitting for a Jamboree game satisfied the suspension. Gregory, however, said he takes responsibility for not knowing the rules.\n\n\u201cThat's kinda my wrongdoing of not knowing the rules and that he shouldn't have not sat out the jamboree, he should have sat out week one so that's what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nGregory also denied he was trying to cover up the fact Jackson was on the field by switching his number during the Week 1 game.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\u201cThat's a thing our kids do on the regular basis, you know, they try to change jersey numbers and sometimes don't let us know,\u201d he said.", "description": "A top Missouri high school football team forfeited all wins from an\u00a0undefeated 2019 season and the program's\u00a0head coach was fired as part of self-imposed sanctions after it was discovered the squad was\u00a0using an ineligible player wearing\u00a0a different jersey.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
