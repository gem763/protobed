PA\n\nCorbyn had been hoping the European Union would move first, providing some clarity on how long a Brexit delay they\u2019ll offer \u2013 but they\u2019re actually waiting for him to show his colours. And he has the deadline of that Monday vote, whereas the Europeans have the luxury of a few extra days until the Brexit process formally expires on October 31.\n\nThe lowest-risk manoeuvre for Corbyn is to vote against the election. That will confirm that Johnson has overplayed his hand, because it will leave him powerless. He\u2019s even threatened to respond by cancelling the November 6 budget and has implied he'll basically stop governing altogether.\n\nJohnson thinks he\u2019ll be able to make capital out of Corbyn ducking the fight and postponing the journey out of the Brexit quagmire. But voters aren\u2019t chafing for an election like the Prime Minister is, and Johnson risks looking like a big sulk.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not going to do Corbyn\u2019s poll ratings any great favours either. And \u201cparliament\u201d (read: everyone except Boris and his band of merry men) is certainly firming in the public eye as the main culprit in the never-ending Brexit saga.\n\nThere\u2019s also an ideological, rather than tactical, reason to vote against an election, which is the one cited by the opposition parties in their defence: it re-opens the theoretical possibility of a post-election no-deal Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorbyn is certainly clinging to that life raft, and will probably kill Johnson's election vote on Monday for that reason.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Johnson may on Monday agree to extend the backbench law that prevented an October 31 no-deal Brexit to cover the January 31 scenario, as a way of winning Corbyn's support.\n\nIf Corbyn decides to support an election, the risks are split. Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position isn\u2019t a vote-winner, nor is his economic agenda. Labour \u2018Leavers\u2019 will abandon him for the Brexit Party (if not the Tories), \u2018Remainers\u2019 will flee to the Liberal Democrats. So he\u2019s on the back foot.\n\nBut Johnson might not be able to profit as he anticipates. He has broken his unequivocal pledge to leave the European Union on Halloween, \u201cdo or die\u201d. The risk for him is that a growing number of eurosceptic voters lose faith in him. In that situation, there could be a surge in support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party that will scupper his chances of winning a majority.\n\nAnother hung parliament would plunge Britain into a really serious political crisis. The question would be whether the political parties could put aside the repetitive groove they\u2019ve dropped into and come up with a cross-party attempt to settle this in the national, rather than partisan, interest.\n\nIf Johnson loses his vote on Monday, he may try an alternative route to an election requiring only a simple majority. His hope then would be to peel off the Scottish National Party and get them to back the election. But they don\u2019t want to help out Johnson, or risk a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSo even if Johnson starts off with a sulk after a Monday defeat, surely he\u2019ll eventually have to go back to trying to get his Brexit deal through parliament, making some compromises on key aspects and hoping these won\u2019t alienate the Brexiteer Tories who made Theresa May\u2019s life a misery.\n\nThe yin of Johnson\u2019s soul, and among his team of aides, probably wants to do this. But there\u2019s also a trenchant, uncompromising yang that just wants to fight and bluster through this. But that way lies a repeat of the October 31 fiasco, except on January 31.\n\nWill Boris regain his footing, or will he keep slipping down the slope?
