All respect to him because he is already crucial.\u201d\n\nFarke insisted United were big favourites to triumph on Sunday despite having failed to win a Premier League away game since February.\n\nBut with his Norwich side having beaten champions Manchester City home last month, the German is confident of another upset.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a 50-50 game - I would say it\u2019s only one game in 10 that we would be able to gain points.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBut it was the same against Manchester City and we were able to create a magic night.\u201d\n\nTop scorer Teemu Pukki hasn\u2019t scored for his club since that shock 3-2 win over the champions.\n\nBut Farke reckoned the six-goal striker is due to find the net.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nHe said: \u201cHe was scoring goals for fun at the beginning. Hopefully he can deliver another special performance.\u201d\n\nNorwich will also remember former club captain Duncan Forbes, who died aged 78 on Wednesday.\n\nFarke added: \u201cI never had the chance to meet him but I\u2019m told that when he was shouting on the pitch you could hear it in Cromer.\u201d", "description": "Farke tried to sign flying Welshman in summer - now he is plotting ways to stop him and cause Carrow Road upset", "authors": ["Jon West", "Image", "Srdjan Suki Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727691.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FK-Partizan-vs-Manchester-United-Belgrade-Serbia-24-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
