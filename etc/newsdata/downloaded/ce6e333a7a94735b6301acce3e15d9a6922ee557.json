REUTERS/Lisi Niesner\n\n\u201cIt is meaningless to continue unilateral commitments to the deal if we don\u2019t enjoy its benefits as promised by the deal\u2019s European parties,\u201d Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart in Moscow.\n\nIran has said it will breach the deal\u2019s limits on its nuclear activities one by one, ratcheting up pressure on the countries who still hope to save it.\n\nTehran has threatened to take further steps by Sept. 6, such as enriching uranium to 20% or restarting mothballed centrifuges, machines that purify uranium for use as fuel in power plants or, if very highly enriched, in weapons.\n\nTehran is prepared to take a \u201cstronger step\u201d in reducing its commitments under the deal with world powers if European countries don\u2019t take action to save the pact, its foreign ministry\u2019s spokesman said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe third step has been designed and will be stronger than the first and second steps to create balance between Iran\u2019s rights and commitments to the JCPOA,\u201d state news agency IRNA quoted the foreign ministry\u2019s spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying on Monday.\n\nHowever, Iran had earlier stressed that these steps are \u201creversible\u201d if the European signatories of the pact fulfilled their obligations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last year exited the accord between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, which the West suspected sought to make a nuclear weapon, in exchange for the lifting of many international sanctions on Tehran. Washington has also reimposed sanctions on exports of Iranian oil.\n\nIran denies ever having sought a nuclear weapon.\n\nAlso, Iran\u2019s government spokesman said on Monday that Iran and France\u2019s views on the deal have moved closer, mainly after phone calls between President Hassan Rouhani and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cFortunately the points of views have become closer on many issues and now technical discussions are being held on ways to carry out the Europeans\u2019 commitments (in the nuclear deal),\u201d the spokesman, Ali Rabiei, said in remarks carried by state television. He did not go into details.\n\nRelated Coverage Iran's Zarif warns EU over nuclear commitments\n\nTwo Iranian officials and one diplomat told Reuters on Aug. 25 that Iran wants to export a minimum of 700,000 barrels per day of its oil and ideally up to 1.5 million bpd if the West wants to negotiate with Tehran to save the nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s oil should be purchased and its money accessible,\u201d Rabiei said on Monday.\n\nIran\u2019s oil exports have plummeted because of the U.S. sanctions, which also make it difficult for the country to receive payments through banks.", "description": "Iran said on Monday it would further reduce its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal if European parties failed to shield Tehran's economy from sanctions reimposed by the United States after Washington quit the accord last year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425363244&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810SY"}
