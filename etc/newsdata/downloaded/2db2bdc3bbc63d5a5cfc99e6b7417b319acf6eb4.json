However, there\u2019s a few people in particular who\u2019s fuming with her actions \u2014 and all these few will become prime suspects as the Dog landlady is brutally shot in the coming episodes.\n\nBetween battling a drug habit, to knocking Grace (Tamara Wall) down during a joyride with Liam (Jude Monk McGowan), Mercedes has had a lot on her plate this year. What\u2019s more, she also had a steamy summer affair with Liam behind husband Sylver\u2019s (David Tag) back, which only made her marital problems all the more stressful.\n\nHowever, things are set to get much worse as Grace played the recording of Mercedes confessing to the hit-and-run aloud in The Dog on the day of Harry\u2019s funeral, and thus the entire village turns on her as a result. Later, she retreats to The Loft and gets drunk, but as she dances on the dance-floor, one of the scorned villagers picks up a gun and shoots her. The question is: which one is it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSylver McQueen\n\nSylver\u2019s quite possibly the most devoted husband in Hollyoaks history, as he\u2019s stood by Mercedes through everything and it\u2019s clear just how much he loves her. However, in spite of everything he\u2019s done for her this year, Mercy repeatedly cheated on his with Liam \u2014 something which will come to light in the coming episodes. Could this perhaps be enough to drive him to want to shoot Mercedes?\n\nActor David said: \u2018Sylver\u2019s motivation could be a number of things: firstly,Mercedes has been having an affair with Liam behind Sylver\u2019s back; she aborted a baby that could have potentially been his; there was the car crash where Mercedes ran over Grace and unknowingly left her for dead.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sylver has become quite close to Grace recently and Mercedes could have killed her or paralysed her. So there\u2019s a few things that could make Sylver quite mad and we know he\u2019s got a bad temper\u2026\u2019\n\nLiam Donovan\n\nThe only person who could rival Sylver in loving Mercedes is Liam. The young man has went to extreme lengths to protect her over the past couple of months, covering up her involvement in the hit-and-run which endangered his own sister. However, Mercedes repeatedly chose Sylver over him, and refused to run away with him earlier this year. But is her capable of shooting the woman he loves?\n\nActor Jude Monk McGowan said: They\u2019ve had a very off and on intense relationship for the last 6 \u2013 7 months and Mercedes has very definitely decided that it\u2019s over, she\u2019s done this to him before. He\u2019s seemingly at her beck and call and Liam is usually not the kind of guy to let that happen. She\u2019s aborted a baby that could have been Sylver\u2019s, it could have been Liam\u2019s, so there are lots of reasons why, in Liam\u2019s mind, shooting her would remove him of a problem. Breda McQueen (Picture: Lime Pictures) When it comes to murdering, there\u2019s nobody more of a pro than Chester\u2019s resident serial killer Breda McQueen. In addition to the fact that she\u2019s bumped off half the village, she\u2019s also demonstrated her disdain for Mercedes on numerous occasions in the past, and she\u2019s made several attempts to murder her before. With news that Mercedes had been cheating on her son about to out, it\u2019s likely that Breda will set about seeking revenge on the young woman once more. Grace Black (Picture: Lime Pictures) While all the suspects on this list have been wronged by Mercedes in soem respect, you could argue that Grace is the one who was hurt the most, what with her having left her to die by the side of a roadside. Grace certainly gets some degree of revenge when she plays the recoding of Mercedes confessing aloud, but could she perhaps go one step further and pull the trigger? Actress Tamara Wall said: \u2018Grace has just found out that it was Mercedes who ran her over and put her in a wheelchair, so she wants to get her revenge. Mercedes was with Grace\u2019s brother, Liam when the accident happened but they framed Harry because it was his car that they were driving.\u2019 On Grace\u2019s rivalry with Mercedes, Tamara mused:It\u2019s always fun. It\u2019s like something out of Dynasty ,I think that\u2019s what we get described as, Alexis and Krystle Carrington, because they are two of the feistiest characters in the show.\u2019 James Nightingale (Picture: Lime Pictures) Ever since discovering Harry had been murdered, James has been hellbent on finding out who was responsible. While he doesn\u2019t discover the identity of the actual killer yet, he comes to believe that Mercedes is the one responsible. Is he capable of murder? Love certainly makes people go to extreme lengths, and it\u2019s safe to say he loved Harry. What\u2019s more, he doubted Harry about his involvement in the hit-and-run, so when he finds out that Harry had been telling the truth, he\u2019ll no doubt be horrified. Actor Gregory Finnegan said: \u2018So, James\u2019 motive for shooting Mercedes is that he blames her for pretty much everything bad that has happened to him and to his ex-boyfriend, Harry over the past few months.He has discovered about the hit and run that Mercedes framed Harry for and he believes that she has silenced Harry and killed him to make sure that the true story doesn\u2019t come out, so James is hell bent on revenge, or is he?\u2019 Diane Hutchinson (Picture: Lime Pictures) In Tony\u2019s (Nick Pickard), Diane has been left to organise Harry\u2019s funeral. When the truth comes to light, she\u2019ll no doubt be horrified that Mercedes was more or less to blame for everything that happened to Harry. What\u2019s more, it was his quest to find Harry that lead to Tony disappearing in the first place, so Mercedes is inadvertently responsible for all the heartache Diane\u2019s endured over the last couple of months. Actress Alex Fletcher said: \u2018Diane\u2019s motive for shooting Mercedes is becauseMercedes let her step-son, Harry take the blame for running over Grace, when in fact that wasn\u2019t the case at all. Nobody wanted to come to Harry\u2019s funeral because of that, because they thought he was such a bad person. Tony went missing because he was trying to find Harry and now obviously he\u2019s disappeared, so Diane blames Mercedes for pretty much everything, for the mess that her life\u2019s in at the moment.\u2019 Joel Dexter (Picture: Lime Pictures) Hollyoaks\u2019 resident vicar has been keeping Mercedes\u2019 big secret for the past couple of weeks, so when the truth outs, he\u2019ll no doubt be shunned by villagers for failing to notify anyone about the truth. If this does prove to be the case, could Joel perhaps seek revenge? Actor Rory Douglas-Speed said: \u2018Joel has a couple of motives: in the weeks previous hefinds Mercedes\u2019 confession that she ran over Grace andhe thinks that Mercedes has also killed Harry. He gets beaten up by Liam and Mercedes then threatens to kill Joel and hurt her own cousin, Goldie who Joel\u2019s besotted by, if he spills the beans, so that\u2019s the first motive.\u2019 The second bit is that she embarrasses him in front of the whole village and calls him out on his past mistakes when he\u2019s trying to not be that kind of guy anymore. He\u2019s a Fox at the end of the day, he\u2019s Warren Fox\u2019s son and thinks that this girl deserves what she gets. She\u2019s pressing and ticking all the boxes for someone to want revenge. Bad Joel is making an appearance and we love bad Joel.\u2019 One to watch: Tuesday 5th September at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mercedes has wronged a lot of people this year \u2014 but which Hollyoaks resident is capable of seeking murderous revenge?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90007670_1571418134.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
