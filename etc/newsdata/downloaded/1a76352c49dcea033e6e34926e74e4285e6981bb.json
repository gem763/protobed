(Cole Burston/Canadian Press via AP)\n\nU.S. national soccer team players arrived in Fairfax on Monday from near (D.C. United\u2019s Paul Arriola) and far (Turkish-based Tyler Boyd), but one call-up stayed behind for an injury assessment.\n\nVeteran striker Jozy Altidore remained in Ontario after departing Toronto FC\u2019s 1-0 victory over the Columbus Crew with a second-half calf injury. U.S. Coach Gregg Berhalter was awaiting word on whether Altidore will be healthy enough to report to camp ahead of Nations League matches against Cuba on Friday at Audi Field and Canada next Tuesday in Toronto.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think I should speculate on it,\u201d Berhalter said before light workouts at George Mason University. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on the results of the scan. When we get the results, together with Toronto, we\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d\n\nAltidore, who turns 30 next month, ranks third on the U.S. career scoring chart with 42 goals in 115 international appearances. He missed the recent friendlies against Mexico and Uruguay because of Toronto\u2019s schedule.\n\nAside from the U.S. schedule, Altidore will want to reach peak fitness for the MLS playoff against United on Oct. 19 at BMO Field.\n\nBerhalter called seven forwards into camp, but among those who are able to play centrally, no one matches Altidore\u2019s experience and strength as a target. He figured to start one of these two matches, perhaps at the Toronto stadium he has called home for five seasons.\n\nBerhalter already lost one player to injury: Los Angeles FC defender Walker Zimmerman suffered a concussion Sunday against the Colorado Rapids and was scratched from U.S. consideration Monday. Atlanta United\u2019s Miles Robinson, who was initially assigned to an under-23 training camp, took Zimmerman\u2019s roster spot.\n\nOtherwise, the rest of the 26-man U.S. squad named last week seems to have gotten through weekend matches without incident.\n\nBerhalter welcomed back defender DeAndre Yedlin, who has not played for the U.S. team since March because of a groin injury. Sidelined with Newcastle in the Premier League since April, he returned Sept. 29 to make a late-game appearance at Leicester City and logged 90 minutes Sunday in a 1-0 victory over visiting Manchester United.\n\n\u201cWe have been with him through this process,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating because it\u2019s been taking a long time for him to get back on the field \u2014 back healthy, back feeling like himself. But he was able to play 90 minutes. You see what he did [against Manchester United]: He just grinded. We were surprised he stayed on, but mentally he got into a good place and just kept working hard.\"\n\nCenter back Matt Miazga also returns after missing the past two friendlies \u2014 and a month of action with English second-tier Reading \u2014 with a hamstring injury.\n\nAnother player back in the mix is Arriola, who skipped the Mexico and Uruguay friendlies for family reasons. Arriola has performed well for Berhalter since the coach\u2019s appointment last winter, making an impact on the flanks.\n\nHe will remain in a wide role for the national team, although he inherited a central midfield job late in the season.\n\n\u201cIf we do interchange,\u201d Berhalter said, \u201cat least he is comfortable in that position coming inside.\u201d\n\n>> Berhalter attended the D.C.-Cincinnati match Sunday but kept a close eye on many of the other 11 games that kicked off simultaneously.\n\n\u201cThose were my favorite days in the league [as Columbus\u2019s coach] where there is a lot of excitement, they are flashing goals, I\u2019m getting my updates on my phone. I had my phone open the whole time, getting the live table.\u201d\n\n>> Besides Arriola, several others in the delegation have ties to the D.C. area: assistant coach Josh Wolff (former D.C. forward), guest goalkeepers coach Rob Vartughian (former University of Maryland assistant), goalkeeper Zack Steffen (Maryland), midfielder Michael Bradley (who lived in Fairfax County when he was young) and attacker Christian Pulisic, whose parents played at George Mason.\n\n>> As of Monday afternoon, 10,150 tickets had been sold. The U.S. team\u2019s visit in June for a pre-Gold Cup friendly against Jamaica drew 17,719. \u2026 Kickoff is slated for 7:06 p.m. on FS1 and UniMas. \u2026 The Americans will train Tuesday through Thursday at George Mason, but all sessions are closed to the public.", "description": "The Americans are preparing for Nations League match against Cuba on Friday at Audi Field.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
