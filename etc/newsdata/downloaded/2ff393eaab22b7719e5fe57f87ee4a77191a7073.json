Hope you took profits or move SL in profits. With double bottom on support I do expect a re-test to commence,\u201d she noted while pointing to the below chart.\n\n$Eth Broke down as mentioned last week\n\nHope you took profits or move SL in profits With double bottom on support I do expect a re-test to commence pic.twitter.com/nA6Q7cXCr0 \u2014 The Cryptomist (@TheCryptomist) October 4, 2019\n\nIt remains unclear as to whether or not its recent climb to over $178 marks an invalidation of its recent downtrend, but it is highly probable that ETH\u2019s near-term trend will be determined by how it trades going into the weekend trading session.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Analysts are warning investors to not get too excited about this Ethereum movement, as a bearish technical formation could spell trouble for ETH.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_661816195-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
