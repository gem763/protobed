REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nTurkey\u2019s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system in July raised the prospect of U.S. sanctions, and the State Department has said an offer to sell Raytheon Co\u2019s (RTN.N) Patriot missile defence system to Ankara has expired.\n\nHowever Erdogan told Reuters he had discussed buying Patriots in a phone call with Trump two weeks ago and would follow up when they meet at the U.N. General Assembly, which opens next week.\n\n\u201cI said no matter what package of ... S-400s we get, we can buy from you a certain amount of Patriots,\u201d Erdogan told Reuters on Friday.\n\n\u201cBut I said we have to see conditions that at least match up to the S-400s,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that he was referring to the possibility of joint production and favourable lending terms.\n\n\u201cHe (Trump) said: \u2018Are you serious?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes\u2019,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that he told Trump they would discuss it in greater detail when they meet.\n\nAsked whether he would also ask Trump to prevent the U.S. Treasury imposing a heavy fine on Turkey\u2019s mainly state-owned Halkbank for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, Erdogan said he was confident they could avoid such a \u201cmistake\u201d, citing what he said was \u201ca different kind of trust\u201d between the two men.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion a country like the USA will not want to hurt its ally Turkey any more. This is not a rational behaviour,\u201d he said in an interview at the Ottoman Dolmabahce palace complex on the Bosphorus in Istanbul.\n\n\u2018SAFE ZONE\u2019\n\nErdogan and Trump will also discuss plans to establish what Turkey describes as a safe zone along 450 km (280 miles) of Syrian border stretching from the Euphrates river to the Iraq border, a region controlled mainly by U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters.\n\nOn Sunday the two countries launched joint military patrols in the area, but Erdogan says that Washington has dragged its feet in an operation Turkey sees as crucial to driving the YPG, which it designates a terrorist group, away from its border.\n\nTurkey has warned it will act alone if the safe zone is not established this month, raising the prospect of a third Turkish military incursion into northern Syria in three years.\n\n\u201cThe peace corridor is the essential thing. We will not allow a terror corridor on our borders and we will take whatever steps are necessary on this subject,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. alliance with the YPG in Syria has angered NATO member Turkey, which has faced a decades-long insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast and fears growing Kurdish military power on its southern border.\n\n\u201cIt is Turkey which is fighting with these terror groups... We are your partner in NATO. You give them the weapons for free that you will not sell for money to your NATO ally,\u201d he said, referring to U.S. arms supplies to the YPG.\n\n\u201cWe are fed up with explaining this... I think Trump must understand us,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nRussia and Iran back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against rebels who sought his overthrow. The United States, European and Arab allies as well as Turkey have supported different rebel factions.\n\nAssad has regained control of most territory lost in the early stages of the eight-year conflict and has vowed to retake every inch of Syria including the northwestern province of Idlib, where Syrian and foreign radical fighters hold sway alongside other more moderate factions.\n\nErdogan reiterated a warning that Turkey would be forced to let Syrian refugees on its soil leave for Europe if Western nations did not provide greater support to Turkey and support its plans for a safe zone where Syrians could be settled.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t accept this business, we will open the gates. Let them go from there wherever they want,\u201d he said.\n\nEstablishing the zone 20 miles (32 km) inside northeast Syria would allow refugees in Turkey \u201cto return to their lands, and allow for all their needs - from education, health, shelter - to be met. It will allow them to live on their own lands and break away from the tent life and container cities,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan said the financial aid Turkey was receiving from the European Union was not sufficient to ease the burden of 3.6 million Syrian refugees who have fled to Turkey since the civil war erupted in 2011.\n\nTurkey says it has spent $40 billion (\u00a332.1 billion) hosting the Syrians, and a deal with the EU to give 6 billion euros to support those efforts was not enough and too slow, a message he would repeat to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the United Nations.\n\nErdogan will host the presidents of Russia and Iran on Monday for talks that would focus on securing a lasting truce in Idlib, preventing a fresh refugee wave into Turkey, and asserting control over jihadist fighters there, he said.", "description": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he will discuss buying U.S. Patriot missiles with President Donald Trump this month, saying his personal bond with the U.S. leader could overcome a crisis caused by Ankara buying Russian air defence systems.", "authors": ["Samia Nakhoul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429528686&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C20L", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
