Don't let him \u01c0 View", "language": "en", "text": "A deadly U.S.-led raidin northwestern Syria has killed the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist, Islamic State founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who reportedly detonated a suicide vest. On Twitter and during an eye-popping Sunday morning press conference, President Donald Trump practically crowed.\n\nNo doubt the president will use this moment to trumpet what he believes are his foreign policy triumphs, for as long as possible. It was only last Wednesday, if we recall, that the president stood at the White House and declared his Syria policy a great success. On that podium and on Twitter, he boasted and bragged and claimed his tacit enabling of a Turkish invasion of Syria \u2014 a massacre of America's Kurdish allies \u2014 had been averted and a permanent cease-fire achieved. Given this alleged peace, the U.S. would be lifting all sanctions on Turkey, he said.\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s grandstanding, and despite even this latest, legitimately positive news regarding Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the past few weeks have not been a collective success. Rather, they have been a boon for America\u2019s adversaries and a catastrophe for its friends.\n\nImportantly, whether deliberately or not, Trump just can\u2019t seem to stop sending valuable gifts to Russian President Vladimir Putin. At this point, even the Russians can\u2019t believe Putin\u2019s good fortune. Because the developments roiling the United States and the Middle East this month all benefit the Kremlin and Russian power. Even better, at least from Putin\u2019s perspective, they were obtained at minimal cost.\n\nPutin\u2019s backers could not imagine it would all turn out so beautifully, but they had a hunch. On the day Trump won the 2016 elections, the Putin-dominated parliament erupted into applause; euphoric lawmakers toasted (literally) with champagne. Three years later, the celebrations look increasingly prescient.\n\nPutin really wants democracy, in the U.S. and elsewhere, to look chaotic and unappealing so that his autocratic methods look trustworthy and wise by comparison, thus strengthening his hold on power. Frida Ghitis Columnist\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and his apparent extortion of Ukraine are only the latest in a conveyor belt of actions that advance Putin\u2019s geopolitical goals. Moscow, which has worked with Trump for many years, wants the U.S. to relinquish its global influence so that Russia can rise, altering the global balance of power. Putin wants to see the West divided and thus weakened for the same purpose; something Trump has achieved. And Putin really wants democracy, in the U.S. and elsewhere, to look chaotic and unappealing so that his autocratic methods look trustworthy and wise by comparison, thus strengthening his hold on power.\n\nWhen Trump plunged the Middle East into turmoil with his announcement that the U.S. would clear the way for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s military ambitionsin Syria, even his fiercest supporters in the U.S. were alarmed. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called it \u201cthe worst mistake of his presidency.\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., said \"a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime.\"\n\nThe Russians agreed wholeheartedly.\n\nWriting in the Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, columnist Mikhail Rostovsky declared that \u201cTrump\u2019s totally misjudged, reckless and contradictory actions\u201d amounted to \u201can unexpected lottery win\u201d for Russia, which \u201cautomatically raises Russia\u2019s influence in the world.\u201d As for the U.S., he noted in bafflement, it was unclear what exactly Washington accomplished. \u201cAmerica lost its way in broad daylight,\u201d he said, according to a translation published by the BBC.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to open a path favorable to both Turkey and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, simply makes no sense for the United States. I, for one, believe it demands more explanation.\n\nBut with the U.S. mostly out of the picture in Syria, Russia becomes the main power broker. Putin is the man to see, and the one whose favor Turkey, Iran, Assad and the Kurds will all seek. Putin has been trying to turn Moscow into a major international player, involving the Kremlin in Venezuela and Sudan as he seeks footholds in Latin America and Africa. And these interventions consistently favor tyrants \u2014 Putin has recently backed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Sudan\u2019s deposed ruler Omar al-Bashir, among others.\n\nThe Syria crisis exploded in the midst of Trump\u2019s other giant mess in Ukraine. There, too, Trump\u2019s exploitation of his presidential powers aligns with Putin\u2019s goals.\n\nRussia has fought to prevent Ukraine from becoming a fully independent nation ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and has supported corrupt regimes there for years. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman Paul Manafort got millions helping a corrupt Kremlin-backed president stay in office \u2014 until Ukrainian protests drove him to exile in Russia. After Ukrainians threw off those shackles, Putin invaded and annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula and prodded pro-Russian insurgents into a separatist war along the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nFor years, the U.S. has backed Ukrainian reformers yearning to clean up corruption and stand up to Russia\u2019s brutality. But Trump\u2019s actions have once again harmed U.S. interests while serving Russia\u2019s.\n\nFor one, part of the scandal includes Trump\u2019s attempt to promote an unfounded theory that suggests it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Russia\u2019s interference on behalf of Trump is thoroughly established. But Trump has repeatedly jumped at the chance to cast doubt on this intelligence. First he sided with Putin and against U.S. intelligence in denying that Russia interfered. Then he bought into a wild conspiracy theory that claims it was Ukraine that hacked the election, working against Trump to help Democrats.\n\nThe Republican Party, a traditional watchdog against Moscow\u2019s designs, has recently turned into a Trumpian lapdog, with its leaders routinely defending Moscow by parroting Trump\u2019s \u201cRussia Hoax\u201d meme. Frida Ghitis Columnist\n\nWithholding military aid helped bolster pro-Russian fighters in Ukraine\u2019s east and hampered a young government seeking to tackle Russia\u2019s corrupt influence and Ukraine\u2019s own chronic graft problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has opened up the U.S. to more influence from Russia. Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, now jailed, allegedly helped launder political cash from Kremlin-linked figures and have ties to the Russia mafia (which itself has alleged tiesto the Kremlin.) It\u2019s not unreasonable to believe that Putin has had a hand in Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\nThe Republican Party, a traditional watchdog against Moscow\u2019s designs, has recently turned into a Trumpian lapdog, with its leaders routinely defending Moscow by parroting Trump\u2019s \u201cRussia Hoax\u201d meme. This in itself is a gift to Putin.\n\nIn an iconic photo taken earlier this week, Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are seen arguing in the White House. When asked what was happening at the moment the photo was taken, Pelosi said, \u201cI was probably saying \u2018all roads lead to Putin.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s what the evidence suggests, and the reason Putin and his friends likely will have a lot more champagne toasts in their future. And we must not allow Trump to use the death of a terrorist \u2014 however good news it may be \u2014 try to distract us from his true record abroad.\n\nFrida Ghitis writes about world affairs.
