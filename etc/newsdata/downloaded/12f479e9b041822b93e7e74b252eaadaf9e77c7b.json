This includes the logistics industry, which, despite continuing on an impressive upward trajectory \u2014 the market is expected to reach $15.5 trillion by 2023, up from $8.1 trillion in 2015 \u2014 is filled with inefficiencies that the distributed ledger technology (DLT) is potentially well suited to fix.\n\nAs a result, the DLT has become one of the most attractive investment opportunities for companies in the logistics space; in fact, the market for blockchain technology in supply chain management is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49% from $41 million in 2017 to $667 million in 2024, according to Zion Market Research.\n\nThis is leading some of the largest firms in the logistics industry to explore blockchain and its potential use cases. For example, in 2017, a group of technology, transportation, and supply chain executives formed the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. BiTA now has over 450 members, including global heavyweights UPS, FedEx, SAP, Google, Cisco, and Daimler.\n\nHowever, there are still major hurdles to overcome before the technology can become commonplace. Many companies, especially small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), are still unaware of what blockchain is, how it works, or what the benefits of the technology are.\n\nIn The Blockchain in the Supply Chain Report, Business Insider Intelligence explores how blockchain can provide value to the global logistics industry. We break down some of the inefficiencies in the logistics industry that are leading firms to explore blockchain and explain how the technology can be used to solve these issues. Additionally, we examine some specific use cases along the supply chain and identify some of the hurdles to adoption. And finally, we take a look at what needs to occur in the logistics industry for blockchain to be deployed widely.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report include: BiTA, FedEx, IBM, Maersk, Modum, SAP, Volt Technology, and Walmart.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:", "description": "In a 2019 report, Business Insider Intelligence explores how blockchain can provide value to the global logistics industry.
