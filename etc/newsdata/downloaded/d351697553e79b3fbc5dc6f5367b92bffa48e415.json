Being a quarterback in this league is definitely a privilege. We have targets on our back, no matter who you are.\n\n\u201cBeing a quarterback of one of the 32 teams is very important in this league. We just have to go in week in, week out and try to silence the critics.\u201d\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nSo, will he be nervous playing so far from home, in a new stadium and with a strange crowd?\n\n\u201cBefore every game, I get butterflies. No form of nervousness but butterflies and just because I care, and I want us to win so badly.\n\n\u201cBut you deal with that with the first play. On the first play you give everything you\u2019ve got and then you empty out the tank.\u201d\n\nNFL on TV this week\n\nSunday: Carolina at Tampa Bay, Sky Sports Main Event, 1.55pm (Highlights, BBC1, 11.40pm); Houston at Kansas City, Sky Sports Action, 5pm; San Francisco at LA Rams, Sky Sports Action, 9.05pm; Pittsburgh at San Diego, Sky Sports Main Event, 1.10am.\n\nMonday/Tuesday: Detroit at Green Bay, Sky Sports Main Event, 1am\n\nThursday/Friday: Kansas City at Denver, Sky Sports Main Event, 12.30am", "description": "NFL LONDON: The Glazers will be in attendance as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers look to get their season back on track", "authors": ["Keith Webster", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566003.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NFL-International-Series-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-Practice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
