As Disney tries to enter the direct-to-consumer streaming video market and compete with giants like Netflix, it\u2019s crucial to be on Fire TV, which is the second-largest distributor of streaming apps, according to the Journal. The disputes are a result of Amazon wanting the right to sell a \u201csubstantial percentage of the ad space on Disney apps,\u201d according to the Journal, but Disney is resisting.\n\nConflicts between Amazon and other companies, including Apple and Google, have kept other popular apps from being carried on Fire TV. YouTube is one example. It wasn\u2019t until this year that Amazon and Google, YouTube\u2019s parent company, were able to come to an agreement over carrying the official YouTube app. Prior to this year, Amazon wouldn\u2019t carry the app, and Google didn\u2019t offer Chromecast users the ability to connect to Amazon Prime Video.\n\nGiving consumers easy access to streaming services is crucial to companies like Disney as more streaming services prepare to launch. Sources told the Journal that a deal could still be reached, and there\u2019s no reported deadline on when talks between Amazon and Disney have to close.\n\nBut the two companies don\u2019t have long before Disney\u2019s streaming service debut. Disney+ will launch in a number of countries on November 12th for $6.99 a month.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s Fire TV is at risk of being the only major streaming platform without Disney+ at launch, as the two companies remain locked in a dispute over advertising, according to The Wall Street Journal.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psIAww1L4_zdWBg2tPuncNN7DQg=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19218417/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
