Combine it with tequila, and a little lime, and you have a very sunny, sippable cocktail you can build right in the glass.\n\nAny grapefruit soft drink will work. Jarritos and San Pellegrino are my two favourites, but if you have another favourite brand, you should feel empowered to use that. Other than your favourite soft drink and some tequila (blanco), you\u2019ll need half a lime. If you want to venture into the world of four-ingredient cocktails, a pinch of salt in the beverage is pretty nice as well. To make this fruity, refreshing cocktail, you will need:\n\n60mL tequila blanco\n\n1/2 a lime\n\n120mL grapefruit soft drink\n\nAdd tequila and the juice of half a lime to a highball filled with ice. Top with grapefruit soft drink and gently stir to combine. Enjoy and repeat as needed.", "description": "A Paloma is one of my favourite \u201csomething and soft drinks,\u201d mainly because it\u2019s a good excuse to drink some grapefruit soft drink, the drink of my childhood.
