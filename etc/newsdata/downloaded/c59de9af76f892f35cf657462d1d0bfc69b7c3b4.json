Almost all unregistered companies are based outside the Netherlands, De Bruin said, citing Poland and Austria as examples.\n\nRotterdam port handles about 40 million tonnes of goods to and from Britain every year and has repeatedly warned about the consequences if Britain does not secure a negotiated withdrawal from the European Union, fearing massive traffic jams and a weakening of international trade.\n\nPort authorities on Wednesday said they had created emergency overflow parking spaces for about 700 trucks, where drivers will get 24 hours to get their paperwork sorted.", "description": "Almost a third of companies who ship goods to Britain through the Netherlands have failed to complete the necessary paperwork for their trucks to embark on ferries after Brexit, the Dutch transport association TLN said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
