President Donald Trump has voiced support for tackling mental health issues related to the violence while also looking at expanded background checks, an issue on which he has wavered.\n\nLeading Democrats have pushed Republicans in the U.S. Senate to take up legislation already passed by the House of Representatives addressing the issue. Lawmakers are expected to look at the legislative options more closely when they return to Washington from their August recess.", "description": "U.S. Attorney General William Barr has drafted legislation that would speed the death penalty for people who have committed mass murder, a White House official said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425447590&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811C9"}
