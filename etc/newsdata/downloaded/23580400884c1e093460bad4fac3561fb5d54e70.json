We tip, he said, \u201cbecause restaurateurs have shifted the burden of paying for some of their labor costs to diners. So when you don\u2019t tip, it affects the wages of servers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCarman did not say that restaurant customers should continue to patronize a restaurant that repeatedly fails to provide good service. He merely wanted people to understand why tips matter, no matter what.\n\nMany folks vehemently disagreed. Here\u2019s just a sample of diners who advocate a sliding scale for tipping:\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe waiters do not deserve any special treatment for bringing you a couple of plates and a glass of water. We have been conned and brainwashed into handing over an increasing amount of tip. I don\u2019t feel sorry for those waiters, many of whom earn more than my son the scientist with [an] advanced degree who makes poverty wage \u2014 and getting no tip for saving mankind.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cTipping is based on scale of service. Great service without question, 20 percent or plus. Average service, anywhere from 15 percent to 20 percent, and really poor service, 10 percent to 15 percent, with a note on the receipt why. It\u2019s no different than a company bonus. You do well, you get rewarded \u2026 don\u2019t ask how the food is, don\u2019t refill my water or ask if you can refill my diet coke, or just be rude or inconsiderate, you are not getting 20 percent. We are all expected to be the best we can be, but if you are not, no, you are not going to get my sign [of] approval.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cI am a retired CEO and have managed many people over the years. Tipping 20 percent when my order is wrong, I am missing silverware and I had to hunt down my waiter to pay the bill is not sending the right message. In fact, I would suggest you are enabling the waiter to not self-improve and thus possibly lose their job. When I receive bad service, I give 5 percent to 10 percent. I leave a note why they didn\u2019t get 20 percent in the hopes that they understand that our actions have consequences. The sooner one learns this lesson, the sooner life will be more successful.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cBased on my performance review, my pay [is] adjusted. How is that different than tipping? Wait staff \u2014 and I\u2019ve worked as wait staff when I was in college \u2014 receive performance reviews with each customer. I suppose next you\u2019ll be writing that all writers at The Post should receive a raise whether their articles are thoughtful or not?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd then there were these comments:\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cIf wait staff doesn\u2019t make enough money, it\u2019s not my job to compensate them beyond the cost of the meal. If nurses don\u2019t make enough, should I buy them a car when I need care in a hospital? Should I go to a school to tip teachers for educating our kids because the schools don\u2019t pay enough? If waiters don\u2019t like what they\u2019re making, they have a choice \u2014 find a better job.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cI refuse to put money in the pockets of people who don\u2019t care. If people care, you can tell; and if they\u2019re having a bad day, I can forgive that. Maybe if they don\u2019t make enough in tips, they\u2019ll get the hell out of customer service work and move on to a factory job.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cTipping is all about service quality. The server doesn\u2019t have the \u2018right\u2019 to a tip. Poor service equals poor tip. If a server isn\u2019t able to deliver quality service, then their incomes will drop and maybe they will find another job.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe tip is low at cheap restaurants and high at expensive restaurants. That does not make sense. The restaurants should pay a living wage and the customers tip whatever they want depending on how happy they are with the quality of ambiance, food and service as well as the depth of their pocket.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cI do empathize with people who are generally underpaid and under appreciated in the service industry. But, it\u2019s not my job to \u2018throw money at the problem\u2019 in order to superfluously subsidize their living expenses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cBad food or service equals bad tip. End of discussion. That is the economic power of the customer.\u201d\n\nI was relieved to read the following comments:\n\n\u2014 \u201cA friend and I were having lunch and a \u2018new\u2019 waitress was assigned to our table. It was unusually busy that day and the service was terrible \u2026 long time for food and beverage to arrive. Food was cold. Coffee was stale. I asked the waitress for another cup of coffee because the one that she just brought was \u2018stale.\u2019 At the end of the meal, we tipped 25 percent. We went back to the restaurant a few days later and the same waitress recognized us, put on a fresh pot of coffee and asked us to wait just a few minutes for the fresh [pot].\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 \u201cI agree with many of the commenters that restaurants should pay a fair wage to its workers. \u2026 But until that happens, I agree with the article\u2019s premise: Just tip your server 20 percent. Carman\u2019s advice to tell a server what you want or don\u2019t want is important. Servers can\u2019t read minds and serve diners who have different ideas of what is good service and what is a pleasant dining experience. They have to straddle a line between being attentive, but not intrusive. Being polite, but not too friendly or chatty. Not to mention the numerous things that affect your experience that they cannot control, such as how quickly your food is prepared and whether it is prepared correctly. To penalize them when they do not meet an expectation you did not share with them is unfair.\u201d\n\nMy mom was a waitress when times were tough professionally for my dad - eight kids. The constant refrain - and I hear it today and think of her on her tired feet at the end of a long day: If you can't afford to leave a decent tip, you can't afford to eat out. \u2014 catewhite (@cfwhite1892) October 9, 2019\n\nUnless a server is actually surly towards me or visibly spits in my food, it's 20% and then rounding up to the nearest dollar. https://t.co/3uA3Tu63vd \u2014 Kristen Page-Kirby (@kpagekirby) October 9, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve written about a lot of personal finance topics \u2014 the cost of retirement or health insurance, economic inequity \u2014 but which topic has received the most comments?\n\nTipping.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI was floored by the profanity people used. The outrage factor about tipping is titanic, with hundreds of readers arguing passionately that it\u2019s their right to withhold or greatly reduce a tip if they think the service was unsatisfactory. Keep me waiting too long for my dessert? No tip for you!\n\nI get it. You want good service. I\u2019d like an attentive, pleasant server, too. But I\u2019ve had many meals where the service was bad, and I tipped well anyway. The difference wasn\u2019t going to break my bank or delay my retirement, so I erred on the side of generosity \u2014 and this coming from a lifelong penny-pincher.\n\nWhat are we talking about here, really?\n\nAbsolutely, you should be discerning so that you don\u2019t enable someone to continually be irresponsible \u2014 whether waiting tables or managing his or her money. All I\u2019m proposing is that you take the focus off yourself and consider that a generous gratuity \u2014 perhaps even one that is undeserved \u2014 can be motivating, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, you are free to do what you want with your money. I just provide a forum for us to respectfully discuss such issues. So, stop swearing at me!\n\nRead more:\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nWhat social practice drives you nuts financially?

I charge everything on my credit cards and pay them in full every month and have for years. Why should I be penalized if I am using a lot of my credit each month?\n\nA: Well, actually you aren\u2019t being penalized. With a score above 800, you are being rewarded for a good credit history. You may not be a perfect 850 for a number of reasons, including not having a mix of credit such as a mortgage or a car loan. But that\u2019s just fine. After a certain threshold, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have a super high score.\n\nQ: Why do people continually tell me not to close an account that I\u2019m not using because it will lower my credit score? I voluntarily closed an Ethan Allen account with a $10,000 credit line that I am positive I will not use. My score runs around 825 every month. Will it be lowered once this voluntary closure is posted to my account?\n\nA: If you\u2019ve established a history of responsible credit management by paying your bills on time and keeping credit card balances low, you are likely to see minimal impact to your score by closing an account.\n\nYou may have heard that you should not close an account that you\u2019ve had for a long time. Positive credit history can stay on your credit report for 10 years from the date the account was closed. It\u2019s important to realize that after your credit score reaches a high enough level, minor changes won\u2019t have a significant or long-term effect on your credit history.\n\nBut here are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n\u2014 Don\u2019t close an account if you are about to apply for credit. You don\u2019t want even a minor drop to affect the loan process.\n\n\u2014 Closing an account could negatively impact your credit score if you have balances on one card or others.\n\nFor more on closing a credit account read: Some guideposts for those lost in Crazy Credit Town\n\nColor of Money Columns This Week\n\nKnowledge isn\u2019t power.\n\nThe right knowledge is power.
