Hongkongers have shed their stereotype as people who care only about making money, months of clashes are helping tip the city into recession. Protesters also managed to shut down the city\u2019s airport, the world\u2019s eighth busiest. The city has changed forever. Emily believes there is no going back.\n\n\u201cI am uncertain about the future of Hong Kong,\" she says. \"In two or three years\u2019 time, it will be more and more suppressive. Of course we are afraid but we have to be brave enough to stand up. If we don\u2019t stand up, a lot of people will get hurt.\u201d\n\nDenise Ho is shaken and clearly furious when AFR Magazine speaks with her just a few hours before she gives a talk at the Sydney Opera House\u2019s Antidote Festival in early September. The previous night, riot police in Hong Kong began using blue dye in the water cannons to leave a lasting mark on the protesters and make them easier to identify. Some officers were captured on camera storming a metro station and beating passengers with batons as they cowered on the floor of a train carriage.\n\n\u201cEveryone is so angry. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d Ho says. \u201cThey beat up everyone and they left. There were no arrests on the train so why were they beating up people?\u201d\n\nHo is a pop singer and actor. In 2014, she was arrested for taking part in the so-called Umbrella Movement, which occupied part of Hong Kong\u2019s city centre. Although she was never charged, her involvement ended her career in China, where her music was banned. \u201cMy career was starting to gain some fans and traction. I have friends who are still earning from that market and they are earning tens of millions, so it\u2019s really very easy money. It\u2019s easy on the revenue side but not easy on the silencing and self-censorship side.\u201d\n\nPop singer Denise Ho has become an unofficial spokesperson for the protesters. \"If on the front line, the young people are using more aggressive means, we understand...\" Alina Gozin'a\n\nShe has become an unofficial spokeswoman for the protesters. In July, she addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council. And while the Umbrella Movement was peaceful, this time around, Ho says, violence is unavoidable. \u201cWe were a largely peaceful population but now, with the police violence, the majority of the people are prepared to fight and defend ourselves from the government clampdown,\" she explains. \"If on the front line, the young people are using more aggressive means, we understand and we don\u2019t condemn them because they are really fighting for their lives. If it\u2019s a totally peaceful protest, there is no pressure on the government.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s protests are, indeed, completely different from the Umbrella Movement of 2014. Back then, pro-democracy activists demanding universal suffrage sat peacefully and occupied main streets in Hong Kong\u2019s CBD for 79 days, armed with little more than the yellow umbrellas that became the symbol for their movement. There were homework stations for students missing out on their classes and university lectures, families camping out in tents and restaurants offering free food. Ultimately these efforts were left unrewarded and the protests petered out. But for many students, they sparked a political awakening and a resolve that has hardened over the past five years, prompting a more determined and extreme approach to demonstrations this time around.\n\nHaving learned from their 2014 experience, the protesters have adopted a \u201cleaderless\u201d approach and guerilla-style tactics over a long, drawn-out occupation. The catch-cry for Emily and her fellow agitators is \u201cBe Water!\u201d, a tactic borrowed from the late martial arts movie star Bruce Lee. The idea is to be adaptable, flexible and on the move, altering plans to dart unexpectedly from one district to the next and keep the authorities guessing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey operate in teams, barricading roads and standing their ground in front of columns of riot police. Some use makeshift hard hats and wooden batons, others throw petrol bombs and meet violence with violence. In response, the police are becoming more aggressive \u2013 deploying water cannons and tear gas, and firing rubber bullets at close range. By the end of August, there was a report of police pointing a gun at the protesters and firing live ammunition into the air.\n\nAs violence begets more violence, the city seems gripped in a downward spiral that might appear to favour heavier intervention from Beijing. But Jimmy Lai, who owns one of the city\u2019s top-selling newspapers, Apple Daily, and is another high-profile backer of the protests, says there is more at stake in 2019. \u201cThe Umbrella Movement was a fight for democracy. When we fight for something we haven\u2019t got yet, the whole purpose is abstract,\u201d Lai says. He speaks via phone from Hong Kong as the campaign\u2019s 80th day transpires, officially making it the city\u2019s longest run of protests since it was handed back to China from the UK in 1997.\n\n\u201cWe are a lot more determined because this time we are not pursuing something we don\u2019t have. We are stopping something we already have \u2013 the rule of law \u2013 from being taken away. This is very different. It\u2019s so much more concrete. It\u2019s so much more real when you're threatened with something you have being taken away.\u201d\n\nMedia tycoon Jimmy Lai at a protest march. Lai is one of the few prominent Hong Kong business people openly supporting the protesters. Getty\n\nLai, who arrived in Hong Kong as a 12-year-old in 1960 after his family took a boat from Guangdong to escape China\u2019s great famine, is a rare voice of support among the city\u2019s prominent business people. Many entrepreneurs and property tycoons made their fortunes on the back of mainland connections and political stability and don\u2019t want a political stand to jeopardise their wealth and status. Lai made his money from setting up clothes retailer Giordano and then Next Media (now Next Digital).\n\nHis business interests have suffered as a result of his pro-democracy stance, with Chinese state-owned companies pulling their advertising from his media companies. At the same time, the government-controlled Chinese news outlets regularly accuse the 71-year-old of orchestrating the protests at the US government\u2019s urging, labelling him a CIA agent. Lai recently met with US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington to discuss the extradition bill and the protests. He says claims he\u2019s a CIA agent are a \u201cbloody lie\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhenever there is a movement against the Chinese government, they always say it is foreign influence,\" Lai says. \"They can never admit that it is because they have done something horrible. They have taken our freedom, that\u2019s why we resist.\u201d\n\nEmily, for her part, takes offence at being tagged a rioter and a radical in the Chinese media: \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable and independent-minded person. I see things clearly.\u201d She says her world changed in 2014 when she took part in the peaceful occupation of the city centre and saw police \u201cbeating up\u201d protesters outside the gates of the city\u2019s Legislative Council building. \u201cI was terrified. I ran back to the road but no one would help. I was so sad. These kids were being beaten in front of my eyes. Something changed for me then.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is worried about the young teenagers who are taking part in the current protests, mostly organised at a moment\u2019s notice on the popular online forum LIHKG, which is similar to Reddit in the US and allows users to stay anonymous. \u201cSome of them say to me: \u2018Emily, sister, I am carrying my last letter in my bag. If anything happens to me, please pass to my parents.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to see things like that. I want to be brave in front of them.\u201d She cries as she tells her story.\n\nHong Kong officially returned to China after 156 years of British rule at midnight on June 30, 1997. The handover was marked with a rain-soaked farewell parade followed by a formal ceremony in the convention centre overlooking Victoria Harbour. Prince Charles read a message from the Queen before standing stiffly next to Tony Blair and watching on as the Union Jack was lowered and replaced with the Chinese flag. In the audience, Australia\u2019s then-foreign minister, Alexander Downer, was struck by the height of the Chinese soldiers on stage (they were reportedly required to be at least 187 centimetres tall), who towered over their British counterparts.\n\nIn his speech, then-Chinese president Jiang Zemin lamented Hong Kong\u2019s \u201ccentury of vicissitudes\u201d under British rule but also expressed optimism for the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d governing model that was being adopted. Deng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher, 13 years earlier, had agreed that Hong Kong would remain a capitalist economy and keep its legal system and basic rights and freedoms until 2047.\n\nMargaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping (centre) at signing of Hong Kong agreement in 1984. AP\n\nMany believed that agreement would allow time for China\u2019s political system to change and open up, becoming more like Hong Kong's. By the time of the handover, the Berlin Wall had fallen and the USSR had collapsed; liberalism and capitalism were sweeping the world.\n\nStanding behind the officials on stage at the handover ceremony that night, in a bright red dress, Anson Chan had mixed emotions. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t know what our future would be like,\u201d Chan, who was head of the civil service both before and after the handover, tells AFR Magazine. \u201cWe hoped for the best but we didn\u2019t know very much about our new sovereign power. We knew they had different values. But most of us just put our hope in the joint declaration,\u201d she says, referring to the agreement Thatcher and Deng negotiated.\n\nThis hope underpinned a decision by Denise Ho, who was born in Hong Kong but grew up in Montreal, to return to the city in the year of the handover and enter a television singing contest. She won, kickstarting a career that would allow her tour the world, star in award-winning films and theatre productions and be feted in both her home city and on the mainland. \u201cI left with my family in 1988 just before Tiananmen Square happened,\u201d Ho says, referring to the violent crackdown on student protests a year later in Beijing. \u201cI arrived back in 1997 and actually felt fine at that time.\u201d\n\nFor more than 10 years after the handover, China lived up to its word and Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. But after President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, the Communist Party increased its control of the city. Having promised to bring in universal suffrage by the 2017 elections, in 2014 Beijing revealed a significant caveat \u2013 everyone would be given the vote but Beijing would first vet the candidates. This triggered the start of the Umbrella Movement.\n\nA year later, five Hong Kong booksellers specialising in gossipy reads about China\u2019s political elite disappeared and emerged later in detention on the mainland. A billionaire businessman was also \"escorted\" back across the border to help Chinese authorities with a corruption case, compounding fears about the ability of mainland security agents to operate freely in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late 2016 and early 2017, six pro-democracy lawmakers were stripped of their seats for failing to take their oaths properly. Meanwhile, leaders of the Umbrella Movement were jailed for their involvement. And last year, the Hong Kong government declined to renew a journalist visa for Financial Times Asia news editor Victor Mallet, who was acting head of the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club when it hosted a talk by an independence advocate.\n\nChan says the extradition bill was the last straw. \u201cThat really raised alarm bells,\" she says. \"Until then, people felt safe in their own beds in Hong Kong but if the extradition proposals were passed, you could be subjected to extradition probably on some trumped-up charge, sent across the border and then maybe you just disappear.\n\n\u201cAll these issues, one on top of the other, impresses upon people here what is happening to \u2018one country, two systems\u2019. In their eyes, it has become \u2018one country, one-and-a-half systems\u2019 and if this deterioration continues, very soon it will become \u2018one country, one system\u2019.\u201d\n\nHo has been blacklisted in China and Chinese state media has branded Chan and Lai members of the new \u201cgang of four\u201d, a reference to the political faction that supported Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution and was prosecuted for treason after his death. The other two people branded members are Democratic Party elders Albert Ho and Martin Lee.\n\nA protester throws an egg at police headquarters in Hong Kong. Bloomberg\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the state propaganda machinery in full swing,\u201d Chan says. \u201cThey think nothing of mounting smear campaigns against people like me who do not toe the line. It\u2019s very convenient to blame foreign interference. I\u2019m sure they themselves don\u2019t believe it. But I think in Hong Kong and on the mainland, there are those who do believe it.\n\n\u201cThe China of today is very different to the China when Deng Xiaoping negotiated the joint declaration. At that time and for several years after the handover, they badly needed Hong Kong investments, managerial and professional know-how and Hong Kong\u2019s connectivity to the rest of the world. But of course the China we see today is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy and increasingly confident about its growing clout. They think nothing of throwing their weight around.\u201d\n\nOne Sunday evening in August as thousands gather in a park for an authorised sit-in, the frontline protesters are darting about the streets with soldier-like efficiency. A man with a megaphone calls for CEO Lam to be sacked and a group of girls hand out bottles of water, while a dozen people dressed head-to-toe in black and all wearing masks suddenly gather around a traffic light. Umbrellas open in synchronised precision, shielding the group from view. There is a hissing sound and the smell of spray paint wafts above their makeshift screen. And then almost as quickly, umbrellas contract and the group disperses, on their way to the next target. The traffic lights they leave behind have been blacked out. Smaller groups jog by with barricades on trolleys. Within minutes, one of Hong Kong Island\u2019s eight-lane highways has been closed to traffic and the thousands gathering in the park are on the move. Everyone is on full alert in case police arrive with tear gas. There is a sense of camaraderie among the crowd, which is filled with people in their 20s and early 30s.\n\nSome protesters have taken on the task of pouring water on canisters of tear gas to neutralise them so crowds don't run away in panic. AP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat evening, the crowd appears to be heading for the Chinese government\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Sheung Wan, an obvious target. But no one AFR Magazine asks is completely sure. An hour later, the river of black suddenly changes course. People with megaphones are yelling \u201cCauseway Bay, Causeway Bay\u201d in Cantonese. This is a popular shopping district four underground train stops away. People begin pouring into an underground MTR station. We join them in the carriage as they chant slogans such as \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nWe get off at Wan Chai and join thousands of others on a long march down Hennessy Road, a major thoroughfare on Hong Kong Island lined with restaurants, bars and shops. But the mood is tense now and it is clearly unsafe. A fight suddenly breaks out between a local man and several protesters; the man is screaming at them to go home. The protesters are fighting on two fronts \u2013 a physical battle with the police and a battle to keep the support of the majority of Hongkongers, whose everyday lives are constantly being disrupted. Minutes later there is a loud bang and everyone freezes, looking around nervously, fearing it is tear gas. But someone from a nearby apartment is throwing objects at the protesters as they walk down the street. Everyone moves to the other side of the road.\n\nCauseway Bay is a battle zone. Tear gas has been fired below an overpass lined with post-it notes and banners supporting the protest movement, a so-called Lennon wall. People sit on the side of the road while friends pour water in their eyes. The air is thick with the stinging fumes. Within minutes, the protesters have moved on to another district.\n\nAfter four months of protests, there is talk of curfews as a way to restrict protesters\u2019 movements. But short of shutting down the internet, the authorities seem unable to stop Hong Kong\u2019s younger generation from mobilising. Apart from LIHKG, the online forum principally used, the protesters rely on encrypted chat groups such as Telegram and AirDrop technology on mobile phones to transmit messages when the network is overloaded or blocked.\n\n\u201cThe actual mechanism is pretty similar to an online game,\u201d explains Matt, another protester, in an interview over Telegram. He says the posts in LIHKG are arranged according to their popularity \u2013 the amount of \u201cup-votes\u201d and responses they get. That ensures the proposed course of action with the most support appears at the top of the feed. It is a raw, albeit imperfect, form of democracy. Once out on the streets, roles are designated according to people\u2019s skills and risk appetite.\n\nViolence begets violence. Yet Matt supports the more aggressive line protesters are taking, in what he describes as the \u201cjust force\u201d approach. His is a generation that is becoming increasingly, perhaps indelibly, resentful towards Beijing. \u201cI want to live under the Hong Kong legal system without the threat of being sent back to the mainland courts and judged by their laws inhumanely,\" Matt says. \"I cherish my liberty and I am willing to fight for it.\u201d\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s descent into anarchy is the result of a widespread belief among a generation of young people that this is their only chance to shape their future.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0367%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2503%2C$y_981/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/92c5b3e6f8f1b25ba30a7369ba240c11b2dac9c2", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
