He then singled out the iconic film director Andrey Tarkovsky \u2013 and mentioned the certain writer and philosopher with a knack for human psychology.\n\nIn school, I always carried around a book \u2018Crime and Punishment\u2019 by [Fyodor] Dostoevsky.\n\n\u201cGame design is a complex discipline that unites various forms of creativity and art,\u201d Kojima told the gathering at the Moscow contemporary art museum Garazh. \u201cEvery day, I seek to watch a movie and regularly read a lot.\u201d\n\nKojima\u2019s love for Russia appears to be mutual as the creator enjoys a significant local fan base \u2013 and has even become a gamer meme. Referred to as none other than \u201cGenius,\u201d often ironically, Kojima could not escape questions on whether he agrees with his nickname.\n\nGeoff, this moment was truly magical. Today at IgroMir 2019 during Death Stranding Comic Con panel fans started to screaming \"Genius, genius, genius!\" to Hideo Kojima. We all know that it's a meme, but still I think he IS genius! @geoffkeighleypic.twitter.com/02WhTZAU4p \u2014 Macintosh (@Maccusha) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019m a genius,\u201d Kojima told the late-night talk show, \u201cEvening Urgant,\u201d where he was invited ahead of his appearance at Comic Con Russia and IgroMir game exhibition. \u201cBut if everybody calls me like that, I\u2019ll probably become one someday.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese auteur game creator came to Russia as part of a promotion tour for his first independent project, Death Stranding \u2013 a game that, despite nearly an hour of CG trailers released and another full hour of gameplay showcased by Kojima himself, still puzzles most people as to what it actually is about. Kojima describes his creation\u2019s genre as something completely new, while doing his best to not give away too much about the plot.\n\n\u0425\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u041a\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0434\u0441 \u041c\u0438\u043a\u043a\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435\u00bb. \u041d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430! pic.twitter.com/Gn5fR5kXbN \u2014 \u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f (@igromania) October 5, 2019\n\nDespite the disturbing, horror-inducing and often violent imagery of the trailers, Kojima insists that the game is all about connecting things, while the fighting is done at the last resort, and will always carry consequences.\n\nThe first tool invented by people was a stick \u2013 to hit others and defend themselves. Later, the people created a rope to tie things together\u2026 The gaming industry is 30 years old already. Yet it has nothing expect for the stick. It is high time a game about ropes came out.\n\nLike this story?
