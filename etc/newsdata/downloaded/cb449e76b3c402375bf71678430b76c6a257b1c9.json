Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPersonally, I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the lurch toward impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh that some Democrats made over the weekend. And I\u2019m at least ambivalent about the court-packing schemes that Pete Buttigieg and others have embraced. But in both cases we don\u2019t need any lectures from Republican officeholders about respect for precedents involving the judicial branch \u2014 not unless they are willing to admit their party denied President Obama\u2019s SCOTUS nominee Merrick Garland the hearings and confirmation vote he deserved.\n\nAnd of all the Republicans who need to keep a low profile on this issue, I\u2019d put Missouri\u2019s young semi-theocratic Senator Josh Hawley near the top of my list. Yet here he is telling The Hill he\u2019s terrified for the Constitution:\n\n\u201cYou know, they want to impeach Justice Kavanaugh, they want to pack the Supreme Court, I mean talk about destroying any institution they can\u2019t control. It\u2019s really unbelievable. This is a Democrat party that increasingly is at war with the American constitution,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nLast time I looked, both impeachment of judges and Congress\u2019 power to regulate the size of the federal courts were right there in the constitution. I\u2019m sure Hawley, a Yale Law School grad and a very bright boy, knows that. So maybe he is referring to that hazy concept, the spirit of the constitution?\n\n\u201c[Democrats are] willing to destroy an entire branch of government, the independent judiciary; they want to destroy it why? Because it won\u2019t rule the way they want it too. I mean is there anything more dangerous to constitutional government than that way of thinking.\u201d\n\nI dunno, senator. I\u2019d say this way of thinking is pretty inimical to constitutional government, too:\n\nScripture teaches that political government is mandated by God for his service and is one means by which the enthroned Christ carries out his rule\u2026.\n\nThese things together tell us something quite important about what government is for, and what Christians should be trying to do with it and with politics. Government serves Christ\u2019s kingdom rule; this is its purpose. And Christians\u2019 purpose in politics should be to advance the kingdom of God \u2014 to make it more real, more tangible, more present.\n\nThat was Hawley in 2012. If that\u2019s too long ago to be considered relevant (I don\u2019t think it is, at all), there\u2019s this reflection on constitutional liberty from a speech he made earlier this year:\n\nPerhaps the most eloquent contemporary statement of Pelagian freedom appears in an opinion from the United States Supreme Court, in a passage written by former Justice Anthony Kennedy. In 1992, in a case called Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, he wrote this: \u201cAt the heart of liberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the Pelagian vision. Liberty is the right to choose your own meaning, define your own values, emancipate yourself from God by creating your own self. Indeed, this notion of freedom says you can emancipate yourself not just from God but from society, family, and tradition.\n\nI\u2019d say treating the idea of individual liberty as the devilish reflection of an ancient heresy professing the perfectibility of human nature is more than a little hostile to the spirit of the constitution.\n\nPerhaps a clue to Hawley\u2019s strange attitude on this subject is that he likes to use the self-identifying label of \u201cconstitutional conservative.\u201d This particular code-term, which was briefly in fashion at the height of the Tea Party Movement, is actually pretty radical, as I explained in 2014:\n\nIt basically holds that a governing model of strictly limited (domestic) government that is at the same time devoted to the preservation of \u201ctraditional culture\u201d is the only legitimate governing model for this country, now and forever, via the divinely inspired agency of the Founders. That means democratic elections, the will of the majority, the need to take collective action to meet big national challenges, the rights of women and minorities, the empirical data on what works and what doesn\u2019t\u2013all of those considerations and more are so much satanic or \u201cforeign\u201d delusions that can and must be swept aside in the pursuit of a Righteous and Exceptional America.\n\nThat sounds like Josh Hawley, all right, who in 2018 had this to say about his wicked country:\n\nExcerpts of an audio tape have leaked of Hawley speaking to a conclave of Christian-right activists in December that\u2019s more than a little out there, blaming the scourge of human trafficking on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and \u201970s. Sexual freedom leads to sexual slavery, he explained.\n\n\u201cIt ends in the slavery and exploitation of young women. It will destroy our families,\u201d he said, per the Kansas City Star. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about, the 1960s, 1970s, it became commonplace in our culture among our cultural elites, Hollywood, and the media, to talk about, to denigrate the biblical truth about husband and wife, man and woman.\u201d\n\nYes, that\u2019s the sort of thinking that has made Hawley the poster boy for a sinister sort of post-Trumpian conservatism that tends to pursue authoritarian means to achieving its godly ends. And it makes him an entirely inappropriate figure to pretend to defend the constitutional order from those godless Democrats.", "description": "Republican senator Josh Hawley, whose theocratic views make him a poster boy for post-Trump authoritarian conservatives, is not a fit defender of the constitution against alleged threats from Democrats talking about impeachment or court-packing.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/17/17-josh-hawley.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
