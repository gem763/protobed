The high court\u2019s order stayed the effect of lower-court injunctions that barred the administration\u2019s plans. One of those injunctions was issued just this week by a federal judge in California.\n\nThe policy, one of several measures the Trump administration has taken to deter immigration from Latin America, demands that refugees seek asylum in a safe country they enter before reaching the U.S. The rules effectively cut off most asylum claims by people coming from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras.\n\nThe court\u2019s unsigned order was a single paragraph and didn\u2019t provide any legal rationale. The justices\u2019 action isn\u2019t a ruling on the merits of the case, which is still proceeding in lower courts.\n\nWednesday\u2019s action stands in contrast to an earlier Supreme Court order from December where, with a 5-4 vote, the justices declined to lift lower-court orders blocking a less severe Trump administration policy that denied asylum eligibility to applicants who didn\u2019t present themselves at an official port of entry. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the court distinguished between the two cases.\n\nPresident Trump said on Twitter after Wednesday\u2019s court order: \u201cBIG United States Supreme Court WIN for the Border on Asylum!\u201d\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, filed a dissent.\n\n\u201cOnce again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution. Although this nation has long kept its doors open to refugees\u2014and although the stakes for asylum seekers couldn\u2019t be higher\u2014the Government implemented its rule without first providing the public notice and inviting the public input generally required by law,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote, echoing reasons lower courts cited in blocking the policy.\n\nIn papers filed with the Supreme Court, the administration argued that the rule was necessary to ease the \u201ccrushing burden\u201d a surge of asylum seekers has imposed on the U.S. immigration system.\n\nThe policy \u201cscreens out asylum seekers who declined to request protection at the first opportunity,\u201d and thus \u201cdeters aliens without a genuine need for asylum from making the arduous and potentially dangerous journey from Central America to the United States,\u201d the government argued.\n\nBlocking the rule \u201cimpairs the security of our border, perpetuates a crushing burden on our asylum system, and impedes ongoing diplomatic negotiations\u201d with foreign countries such as Mexico,\u201d the administration argued.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant and other immigrant-rights groups challenging the policy, argued in legal papersthat the administration was attempting \u201ca blatant end-run around the scheme Congress created\u201d to manage asylum applications.\n\nAfter the high court\u2019s action, ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said: \u201cThis is just a temporary step, and we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll prevail at the end of the day. The lives of thousands of families are at stake.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s action means the Trump restrictions can be enforced along the entire border\u2014and likely for many months.\n\nLitigation in the case could take another year or longer to conclude.\n\nIn July, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar Oakland, Calif., issued a nationwide injunction halting implementation of the rule while litigation over its legality proceeded.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, later narrowed the injunction to its own circuit, which includes the southern border states of Arizona and California. That meant the administration couldn\u2019t enforce the restrictions there, but it could in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nJudge Tigar this week restored the nationwide scope of his injunction, offering additional reasons why he believed such an approach was appropriate.\n\nJudge Tigar found that the administration\u2019s restrictions likely didn\u2019t follow congressional requirements: For one, there was no agreement with Mexico, as there is with Canada, for refugees to be returned to its soil. In addition, Judge Tigar said the record indicated that refugees would be at risk of violence and abuse if they were forced to seek asylum in Mexico.\n\nJudge Tigar also found the government skirted legal requirements to provide public notice and comment for the third-country rule, saying that process likely would have brought to light the dangers to refugees of seeking asylum in Mexico.\n\nOther challenges to the policy are pending in other courts. In July, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., declined to enjoin the rule while a challenge by different immigrant-rights groups proceeds.\n\nThe Trump administration has suffered an array of legal setbacks in its bid to take a tougher stance with U.S. immigration policy, but the tide has started to shift in recent months. The White House scored another notable victory in May when the Ninth Circuit appeals court allowed the administration to continue returning Central American migrants to Mexico while their requests for asylum in the U.S. are adjudicated. Litigation in that case also is ongoing.\n\nAnd more high-stakes cases are looming. The Supreme Court in November will consider whether the Trump administration acted lawfully when it canceled an Obama-era program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that provided benefits to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. The program remains in effect for now.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement: \u201cWe are pleased the Supreme Court has ruled our administration can implement important, needed fixes to the broken asylum system. This greatly helps build on the progress we\u2019ve made addressing the crisis at our southern border and will ultimately make American communities safer. The district court\u2019s erroneous nationwide injunction was another in a series of overreaching orders that allowed a single, nonelected district court judge to override policy decisions for the entire nation.\u201d\n\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "description": "The Supreme Court authorized the Trump administration for now to deny asylum to Central Americans who cross through other countries on their way to the U.S.", "authors": ["Brent Kendall", "Jess Bravin", "Brent.Kendall Wsj.Com", "Jess.Bravin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106418/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
