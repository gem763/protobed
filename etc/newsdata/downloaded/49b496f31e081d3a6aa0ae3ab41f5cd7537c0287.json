Sources familiar with his work said he would have had knowledge of code words and operations.\n\nOrtis was charged under a section of the Security of Information Act that applies to individuals \"permanently bound to secrecy\" as a condition of their work \u2014 which strongly suggests he had access to top secret material.\n\nUnder the Security of Information Act, Ortis has also been charged with:\n\nUnauthorized communication of special operational information.\n\nPreparing for the commission of an offence by obtaining or gaining access to information, or possessing any device, apparatus or software used for concealing, surreptitiously communicating or obtaining information.\n\nOne of the charges stems from 2015, while the others span a year, going back to September of 2018.", "description": "The cache of classified intelligence material an RCMP official was allegedly preparing to share with a foreign entity or terrorist organization is so vital to Canada's national security\u00a0that the country's intelligence agencies say its misuse strikes at the heart of Canada's sovereignty and security, documents seen by CBC News reveal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283250.1568424627!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cameron-ortis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
