He was eventually released because the couple couldn't afford the ransom.\n\n\n\nFelipe Reyes, a psychologist at one of the MPP shelters, has treated asylum seekers for everything from depression to PTSD.\n\n\"I've seen people kidnapped twice,\" he said.\n\nA new report from Physicians for Human Rights states that \"U.S. policies have stranded asylum seekers\" in Mexico, where they are \"vulnerable to violence, theft, and extortion by cartels, gangs, and police authorities.\" The group says 12 out of the 15 asylum seekers they spoke to showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 and that even children reported having symptoms.\n\nAccording to the administration's protocols, also known as \"Remain in Mexico,\" all asylum seekers are now required to wait in Mexico for the entirety of their court proceedings.\n\n\"With MPP, migrants are receiving due process and protection while the United States is restoring integrity to our immigration system,\" said Acting Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan.\n\n\n\nThe mayor in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico insists the city safe and the violence is under control. Last month, U.S. officials apprehended or turned away approximately 52,000 migrants, a more than 60% decline from the peak in May. CBP said Tuesday that the immigration crackdown is working.", "description": "\"It's not safe for them to be here,\" one doctor said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/e90c7b82-4043-428c-8d9a-5caa0f3d6ed5/thumbnail/1200x630/8850448aa6d13d38c5aa0072bdd39d12/ctm-saturday-clean-feed-20191012-cr470c-0700-0900-01-frame-57847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
