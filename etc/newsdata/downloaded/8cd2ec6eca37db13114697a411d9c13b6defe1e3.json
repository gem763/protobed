McMaster: Some Trump Advisers Are a \u2018Danger to the Constitution\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Former national security adviser H.R. McMaster has accused some unnamed White House advisers of being \u201ca danger to the Constitution\u201d by trying to manipulate President Trump to achieve their own ulterior motives.\n\nMcMaster, who was rumored to be at loggerheads with Trump for months before his departure in March 2018, stopped short of offering his own assessment of the president while making the remarks Wednesday at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But he suggested that at least two distinct groups of advisers to the president are secretly running point on agendas that are at odds with those of Trump himself.\n\nOne group, he said, consists of those \u201cwho are not there to give the president options\u2014they\u2019re there to try to manipulate the situation based on their own agenda, not the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nThe other group \u201ccast themselves in the role of saving the country, even the world, from the president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think those latter two categories of people are actually a danger to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile McMaster did not identify any White House advisers in his warning, it appeared to echo a claim about an internal \u201cresistance\u201d made in an explosive anonymous op-ed published by The New York Times last year. The op-ed, whose author claimed to be a senior official in the Trump administration, said several officials worried about Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior were intentionally thwarting parts of his agenda to stop his \u201cworst inclinations.\u201d\n\nMcMaster, a retired Army lieutenant general, joined the administration's inner circle after Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was abruptly fired after a few weeks on the job.", "description": "In a rare speech, the former national security adviser suggested two distinct groups of advisers are actually acting against the president.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2260,w_4018,x_0,y_309/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1557354860/RTS1NTIE_iexvhj", "published_at": "2019-05-08"}
