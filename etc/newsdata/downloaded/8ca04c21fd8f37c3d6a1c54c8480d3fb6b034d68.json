And an assumption that an all-electric economy will emerge just as soon as we close the alternatives,\" Dudley said.\n\nWhen asked by CNBC why he referenced Bloomberg in his speech, Dudley replied: \"Because I think it is irresponsible.\"\n\n\"I think it means well (but) it is not going to work in so many countries.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Michael Bloomberg was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Wednesday afternoon.", "description": "BP CEO Bob Dudley believes Michael Bloomberg's $500 million plan to halt the building of gas-fired power plants is \"irresponsible.\"", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106172150-1570621175928gettyimages-1148400353.jpeg?v=1570621247", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
