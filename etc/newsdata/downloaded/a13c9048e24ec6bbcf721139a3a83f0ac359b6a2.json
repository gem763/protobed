WeWork, which replaced its controversial chief executive last week, announced that it will withdraw a plan to go public\n\nGlobal credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Tuesday downgraded WeWork's credit rating by two notches to 'CCC+', putting the Softbank-backed office-sharing firm deep into junk territory\n\nFellow ratings agency Standard & Poor's last week downgraded WeWork to 'B-' from 'B'.\n\nBoth 'CCC+' and 'B-' are junk bond ratings reserved for corporate borrowers judged to be higher risk to lenders.\n\nWeWork is in discussions with banks as well as its largest investor SoftBank Corp about potential alternative funding, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe backlash against the startup unfolded after the company's huge losses were revealed in its prospectus filing for an IPO.\n\nCEO Adam Neumann and his wife Rebekah Paltrow Neumann are pictured last April. She produced WeWork's S-1 and, insiders say, treated it like the 'September issue of Vogue'\n\nAmong WeWork's expenses was a Gulfstream jet the company paid $60million for and to have it redesigned inside. A file image of the style of jet he bought is shown\n\nIt revealed, among other things, WeWork's huge losses ($1.6 billion) which sent investor faith and public opinion of the company plummeting.\n\nIt also raised questions about ousted Neumann's potential conflicts of interest and his ability to lead.\n\nUntil then, the company had relied on public image and buzz to boost its reputation. It was valued at $47billion - a 'ridiculous' sum by some analysts' measures.\n\nAmong complaints from staffers was that Neumann charged ahead prematurely with the IPO when he should have been focusing on the company's growth.\n\nSome also criticized him for bringing in his wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, to produce the S-1 - a regulatory form that all companies must submit when they apply to go public.\n\nThe introduction to WeWork's S-1 is shown above. The sleek, image-heavy document did not fall in line with the normal format followed by companies when submitting their financials\n\nThis is one of the pages from the S-1 which Neumann's wife produced with the help of a creative director and professional photographers. She featured celebrities like Anna Faris in the document and quoted her gushing about the office space she could rent. The glossy, magazine-like S-1 did not fail to disguise the company's huge losses, however\n\nNormally a standard regulatory filing, in WeWork's case the S-1 was a glossy, pitch-deck like portfolio which featured celebrities and Instagram influencers including Anna Faris and Aimee Song.\n\nIt showcased the company's offices and touted the 'amenities' clients' got with them - flavored water, micro-roasted coffee, cleaning, and 'craft on draft' beer.\n\nInsiders said the way Neumann handled the document was typical of WeWork - to focus not on the point of it, which was to prove the company's financial viability, but to jazz it up.\n\nIt also cast Neumann's astronomic spending in new light. In recent years, the young former CEO has amassed an $80million property portfolio.\n\nHe also bought a Gulfstream jet and personalized it to the tune of $65million. Before he was ousted, the company announced plans to sell it.", "description": "WeWork plans layoffs\u00a0'in the thousands', though less than the 3,000 to 5,000 number that had been previously reported, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider .", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303284-0-image-a-19_1570203960967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
