Eliot Engel (D-NY), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Pompeo is \u201cnot complying\u201d with the impeachment inquiry \u201cso far.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping there are discussions that are ongoing, and we\u2019re hoping that he will comply,\u201d he added.\n\nPompeo also told reporters in Greece that House lawmakers had \u201charassed and abused\u201d State Department officials \u201cby contacting them directly\u201d rather than their lawyers first.\n\nThe secretary of state proclaimed:\n\nSadly, there have been congressional inquiries [by Democrats] that have harassed and abused State Department employees by contacting them directly and seeking to have them provide documents \u2014 documents that belong to the State Department, that are official U.S. government records \u2014 and asked them to do so \u2026 saying, \u201cHey don\u2019t bother calling the State Department lawyers, just talk to us directly.\u201d That\u2019s harassment, and I\u2019ll never let that happen to my team.\n\nOn Face the Nation, Engel dismissed Pompeo\u2019s accusations of \u201charassment\u201d as \u201claughable.\u201d\n\nUnder President Trump, \u201cwe have been getting numerous complaints from people who work at the State Department about all kinds of harassment by this administration,\u201d Engel argued.\n\nEchoing other Trump administration officials, Pompeo denounced demands for documents at the hands of the Democrat-led House as a partisan exercise.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly politics involved in this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chairmen of the House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs requested documents linked to the State Department\u2019s dealings with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s private lawyer, and other matters affiliated with the July 25 phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims that Trump withheld aid to Ukraine in a bid to pressure the Eastern European country to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nTrump denies the accusations.\n\nThe U.S. president urged Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s link to the owner of energy company Burisma Holdings, which had been under investigation by the former top prosecutor in Ukraine.\n\nAs vice president, Biden pushed Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, prompting accusations of corruption.\n\nOn Friday, the prosecutor general\u2019s office in Ukraine said it is reviewing its investigation into the owner of Burisma.\n\nUkraine opened the original investigation into Burisma while Hunter Biden was serving as the company\u2019s board member.", "description": "Mike Pompeo said his department sent Congress an \"initial response\" letter following a subpoena for documents linked to the House impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mike-Pompeo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
