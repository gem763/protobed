In turn, the kids won\u2019t be expected to perform official royal duties.\n\nMembers of Sweden\u2019s royal house are entitled to receive a taxpayer-funded annual sum known as an appanage, the BBC noted. The Swedish monarchy is estimated to cost taxpayers some $14 million annually.\n\nThe king\u2019s decision will affect five of his seven grandchildren: the two sons of Prince Carl Philip, the king\u2019s second of three children; and the two daughters and one son of Princess Madeleine, the king\u2019s youngest child.\n\nBoth Prince Carl Philip and Princess Madeleine said they welcomed their father\u2019s move.\n\nThe princess said in an Instagram post that the change would give her children a \u201cgreater opportunity to shape their own lives as private individuals,\u201d according to a CNN translation. Her brother echoed that sentiment, saying on the social media site that his sons would get \u201cfreer choices in life.\u201d\n\nThe king\u2019s announcement likely was in response to a brewing controversy in the country about the growing size of the royal house and its impact on taxpayer pockets, Swedish historian Dick Harrison told BBC.\n\nThe king\u2019s grandchildren had yet to be targeted in these conversations, but \u201cthe king is preventing a discussion that otherwise would have taken place,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nThe king\u2019s decision will not affect the position of his three children or his wife, Queen Silvia, who \u201cwill continue their work in the non-profit foundations and organizations which they have founded or in which they are involved,\u201d Fredrik Wers\u00e4ll, marshal of the realm, said in a statement on the Swedish Royal Court\u2019s website.\n\nThe son and daughter of the king\u2019s eldest child, Crown Princess Victoria, will also remain in the royal house. Princess Estelle, 7, and her 3-year-old brother, Prince Oscar, are second and third in line to the throne, respectively.", "description": "King Carl XVI Gustaf stripped the children of their royal highness status amid questions about the cost of the taxpayer-supported monarchy.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9c3f332100005907abfc64.jpeg?cache=3lvaa2d7xv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
