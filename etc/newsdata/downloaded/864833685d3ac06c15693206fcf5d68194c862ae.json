You don\u2019t want an election. Let\u2019s get on with the people\u2019s agenda\u201d \u2014 senior officials later said that if Tory MPs vote against the prime minister on Tuesday, the government would push for a general election, likely on October 14.\n\n'No circumstances'\n\nFollowing a hurriedly arranged meeting of his Cabinet on Monday, Johnson insisted that there would be \u201cno circumstances\u201d under which he would request a Brexit delay from Brussels, warning MPs attempting to prevent the U.K. from leaving with no deal that they would \u201cplainly chop the legs out from under the U.K. [negotiating] position.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister said: \u201cIf there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum or that tomorrow MPs will vote with Jeremy Corbyn to get another pointless delay.\"\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThe move, designed to put pressure on Tory MPs not to vote against their own government, came shortly after a cross-party group of MPs published a draft bill that would force the prime minister to request a three-month extension to Brexit negotiations if a deal is not agreed between the EU and the U.K. by October\u2019s European Council summit.\n\nThe extension bill, to be officially put forward by Labour MP Hilary Benn and which has been signed by Tories who served under Theresa May as well as MPs from other opposition parties, was revealed on Monday night.\n\nIt would force Johnson to request an extension from Brussels until January 31, 2020 if he has failed to secure a deal by October 19. The bill spells out exactly what the prime minister would have to write to the bloc in his request, and notes that he would be forced to agree to any extension offered by the EU within two days unless the EU offer is rejected by parliament.\n\nElection threat\n\nSpeaking after the statement, a senior government official set out the plan if the opposition proposal is successful, warning the government would put forward a motion for an early general election, which would be put to MPs on Wednesday.\n\n\"If they vote tomorrow to wreck the negotiating process, to go against giving Britain the ability to negotiate a deal, they will also have to reflect on what comes next,\" the official warned.\n\nIn order to call an election, the prime minister must first secure backing of two-thirds of MPs in the House of Commons. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated on Monday he is likely to back such a move, saying the U.K. \u201cneeds\u201d a general election.\n\nAlso in his statement outside Downing Street, Johnson tried to persuade wavering Tory MPs who could vote for the Brexit extension bill that he is \u201cencouraged\u201d by the \u201cprogress\u201d the U.K. was making in the Brexit negotiations.\n\n\u201cIn the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey can see that we want a deal. They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU \u2014 something that has perhaps not always been the case. And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may.\u201d\n\nBut former Chancellor Philip Hammond penned a letter to Johnson demanding he set out exactly what progress has been made since the prime minister visited Berlin 11 days ago.\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the bill would stop Johnson \u201cforcing through a reckless and damaging\u201d no-deal Brexit on October 31 and could be \u201cparliament\u2019s last chance to stop a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
