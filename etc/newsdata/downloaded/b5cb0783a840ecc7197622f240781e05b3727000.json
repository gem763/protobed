Adam Schiff (D-CA) is a snake. Period. There\u2019s no way around it. He\u2019s part of the cabal of anti-Trump Democrats who pushed the Russian collusion myth for two years. Actually, he and the rest of his clown crew haven\u2019t but we have a new front in this war against Trump. The Trump-Ukraine phone call that the Left thought would be their ticket to impeachment.\n\nSome whistleblower, who is reportedly a CIA agent, alleged that Trump shook down Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, threatening to withhold aid unless they investigated possible acts of corruption committed by Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was placed on the board of an energy company during his father\u2019s time in office. Hunter was not qualified to serve in that position; he has no energy experience and it was seen as a way to sell access to the U.S. elite.\n\nAlas, it was all fake news. There was no quid pro quo. But House Democrats decided this allegation was enough to launch a formal impeachment inquiry\u2014and all of this was done before the complaint was ever released.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Schiff knew about the complaint a month before this whole impeachment circus started and now, we find out that Schiff actually had contact with the whistleblower and knew about the allegations before this complaint was formally filed. So, talk about collusion between House Democrats and the intelligence community. Also, Schiff said he never spoke with the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower. Uh, he did\u2014and our friends at Twitchy noted it:\n\nRep. Schiff: \"We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.
