It is embarrassing to the media how much they botched this. It is a level of self-preservation that makes them completely incapable of handling this story,\u201d Hemingway said.\n\nHemingway\u2019s comments came after President Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he hopes Attorney General William Barr looks into potential ties between Ukraine, Hillary Clinton and the controversial anti-Trump dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele.\n\nHemingway said that White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s explanation of the Ukraine controversy at a news conference last week was \"confusing,\" but faulted the media for \"willfully misunderstanding\" the story.\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ: REPUBLICANS 'FINALLY PLAYING OFFENSE' ON IMPEACHMENT AND NEED TO DO MORE OF IT\n\n\"It requires the media to not be so reflexively hostile and actually try to understand the situation,\" she said, adding that Mulvaney was trying to explain why Ukrainian corruption and the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia probe are important issues.\n\nSpeaking to Hannity in an exclusive interview Monday, Trump discussed potential ties between Clinton, the dossier and Ukraine, something he said he has been \u201chearing about.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear about Ukraine, and you\u2019ve been hearing about it. I heard Clinton was involved,\u201d the president told Hannity.\n\nHOUSE VOTES TO SET ASIDE RESOLUTION CENSURING ADAM SCHIFF\n\nTrump has continued to face criticism over allegations he temporarily delayed $391 million in aid in order to leverage Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating potential involvement of his governent with Democrats during the 2016 election.\n\nThe investigation was mentioned during a phone call between the two world leaders, but both Trump and Zelensky have insisted there was no pressure involved. Hemingway said Americans still want to know what happened in 2016, since the probe conducted by Robert Mueller failed to address questions about how the investigation began and failed to substantiate explosive allegations about Trump's connections to Russia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cPeople are hungry for the facts. They do want to know just what happened in 2016. How did this false and dangerous conspiracy theory take root in our government, in our media?\u201d she said.", "description": "The media narrative surrounding Democrats' impeachment push is \u201cembarrassing,\" Fox News contributor\u00a0Mollie Hemingway told \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/mollie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
