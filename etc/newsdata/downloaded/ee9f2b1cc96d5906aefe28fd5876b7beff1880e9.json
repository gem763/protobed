It must be Transylvania, the home of Dracula, right? Or Salem, Massachusetts, for its history of witches, right. Maybe even New York, for its celebrity-led annual Village Parade.\n\nOne place you almost certainly wouldn't think of is Derry \u2013 the second city of Northern Ireland. But that's where you'd be wrong.\n\nI was born and bred in Derry, so don\u2019t take my word for it. Instead, listen to USA Today, who named Derry the \"best Halloween destination in the world\" in 2015. If Americans say someone else does Halloween better, you can guarantee they do.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It was only when I first moved away from Derry for university that I realised Halloween wasn\u2019t nearly as big a deal anywhere else, and I've always wondered how our city came to be such an essential festive location. The answer, it seems, has its roots in Irish history.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the Americanisation of 31 October. Halloween's origins date back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (sow-in), when, according to tradition, the ghosts of the dead returned to walk the earth before a new year began for the Celts on 1 November\n\nThis sparked a long tradition of sacrifices, bonfires, activities, and the telling of ghost stories. Indeed, despite the introduction of Christianity, the pagan culture of Ireland \u2013 and a belief in the supernatural, spirits, and fortune tellers \u2013 remained very much alive in the nation. The popularisation of Halloween in America in the late 19th century coincided with the mass migration of Irish people following the potato famine of the 1850s, suggesting that as with many American traditions, it was brought to the country by immigrants, before being mass-marketed and exported back to the world.\n\nBut back in Derry, the carnival we know and love is entirely homegrown. My grandparents\u2019 generation have memories of little more than telling ghost stories, but Jacqueline Whoriskey, the festival manager, fills me in on how the festivities grew in size.\n\n\u201cIt was started by the local communities, groups getting together and dressing up,\" she says. \"Derry has a lot of creativity, and because it was a city of shirt factories, people also had the skills to put together great costumes. It was done among the local people long before it drew others in from abroad.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, the city council stepped in to make Halloween more of an organised event. Arthur Arbuckle was one of the workers who helped put that first year together.\n\n\u201cIt was a very small carnival,\" he tells me. \u201cWe built a stage in the Guildhall Square, there was a small band, no parade \u2013 just a festival which then grew year after year. I\u2019ve spoken to people who\u2019ve come from all over the world: England, Germany, America. They just thought it was the greatest thing ever.\u201d\n\nThat certainly rings true for the people I spoke to. Lorenzo De Martino \u2013 an Italian living in London \u2013 visited Derry for Halloween with friends a few years ago, and remembers how the locals \u201ctruly embraced\u201d the whole affair.\n\n\u201cI was positively surprised at the effort people made for fancy dress, and how big an event is actually is,\" he says. \"It wasn\u2019t just about finding a ready-made costume to wear but to go and find different pieces in different shops to create the best and most original outfit.\u201d\n\nOtherwise known as being a city of song and dance, rich in history with a reputation for a good night out, the Halloween celebrations fuse the best of Derry together \u2013 starting with the 17th-century city walls that give it its nickname, the Walled City (Derry is the only fully intact walled city in Ireland). While they've often been seen as a divisive symbol in a city largely populated by Irish nationalists, now the Halloween \"wakening of the walls\" \u2013 which see them brought to life with art projections and nearby parades \u2013 has given them a new significance.\n\nIn 2013, the Halloween carnival was one of the centrepieces of Derry\u2019s year as UK City of Culture. On the occassion of its 30th anniversary in 2016, the council estimates 80,000 people took part in four days of festivities \u2013 with 30,000 people attending the main carnival itself. It's unique in the world, insists Whoriskey. \u201cWe don\u2019t know of anywhere else in Europe that puts on a Halloween carnival like we do \u2013 and we have looked hard!\u201d\n\nVisitors to the carnival can expect fireworks and Jack-o\u2019-lantern competitions (with traditional Irish turnips used for carving in addition to the expected pumpkins). To tie in with this year\u2019s theme of \u2018Under the Samhain Moon\u2019, there will be a giant moon on display in the central Guildhall Square \u2013 the centre for many activities \u2013 before it is released during the final parade.\n\nOf course Halloween isn\u2019t just for children, and it isn't just for horror fans either. The Derry celebrations will see a harvest market for foodies, the Samhain Sessions for music lovers, as well as plenty of opportunities to scare yourself senseless \u2013 literally. The Playhouse Theatre is engaging the help of its resident ghost \u2013 supposedly a nun, who lingers there from when the building was a school \u2013 and putting on a sensory deprivation exercise called \u2018See No Evil\u2019 which involves being put in a room blindfolded, to heighten your other senses.\n\nSo, for the best Halloween experience in the world, rooted in th festival's history, look no further than Derry. And remember: spooky costumes bought in a shop are usually frowned upon, so get creative while you\u2019ve still got time.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nBMI Regional flies to Derry from London Southend.
