As a result, Alexa can be affordably plugged into every room in our home, accompany us in our vehicle, become our hi-fi sound system, keep order to our daily meal planning and simplify Wi-Fi around the house.\n\nWith this expanded offering, we are going to see Alexa adoption grow fast and Amazon\u2019s consumer data grow even faster. This will drive up Amazon\u2019s performance, and its stock is primed to go along for the ride.\n\nFrom 100 million to 1 billion\n\nEarly in 2019, Amazon touted a vague but inspiring number of 100 million Alexa-powered devices sold. Now not every one of these were made by Amazon, but all the other companies are paying to license its technology. And so now we order those Kleenex, accessories and an endless stream of unnecessariness by just saying the word. Don\u2019t believe me? I have an extra fire pit and about 100 Clif bars I never intend to eat. Thanks, Alexa.\n\nSo don\u2019t scoff at the idea of Alexa-powered eyeglasses or a stylish ring (Echo Loop) that you can talk to and that sends a quick jolt to let you know you have new notification. These just a few examples of the 14 new products unveiled on Wednesday.\n\nSuddenly users will have three or four Alexa devices per person, per household, and that 100 million quickly grows to more than a billion devices, all of which track, monitor and offer immediate gratification of our every need. They will order our groceries, book our dinner reservation, play our favorite songs and more. All this will feed the data machine that enables Amazon to know even more about what we listen to, who we call, where we go to dinner, our favorite travel destinations and, well, pretty much everything.\n\nGoogle GOOG, -0.50% GOOGL, -0.39% knows our search intent\u2014what we want to buy. Amazon will know everything.\n\nAnd while not every product launched by Amazon is sure to be a hit, (See: The Fire phone), I\u2019m sure that many of these products will be wildly successful. Many are relatively inexpensive, for between $25 and $250. The Echo Studio brings hi-fi sound to every home for a couple hundred bucks, and the Amazon EERO mesh Wi-Fi will allow you to just ask Alexa to set up a guest network. The $25 Amazon Echo Flex lets you put an Alexa in every room of your home for less than the price of a decent alarm clock.\n\nPerhaps the only new product I\u2019m not sure will sell in numbers is the Alexa Oven, but I could be completely wrong on that. I mean, what is it worth to be able to watch your chicken breasts cook to perfection while you run to the store to pick out the perfect bottle of wine to match?\n\nThe bottom line is Amazon is making smart home and connected lives not only possible, but also very affordable. This will lead to significant sales growth for that hardware. One forecast says 75% of U.S. households will have smart speakers by 2025.\n\nBut it is just the beginning, because we all know the key to Amazon\u2019s success is that it knows you, the consumer, from the inside out. The expansion of the Amazon line will power the company to another level of customer insights, which will lead to greater spending by you and greater earnings for the e-commerce giant.\n\nAmazon is about to go for an AI-powered bull run. You may want to ask Alexa to call your stockbroker before you miss the ride.\n\nDaniel Newman is the principal analyst at Futurum Research. Follow him on Twitter @danielnewmanUV.
