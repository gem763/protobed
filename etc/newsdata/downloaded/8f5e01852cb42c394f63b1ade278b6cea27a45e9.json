REUTERS/Dave Paresh/File Photo\n\nA report from London-based charity Privacy International said that many users around the world lack meaningful insight into how ads are targeted on social media services.\n\nThe group called Google \u201cespecially deficient\u201d in disclosure of information about targeting, which enables advertisers to deliver tailored messages to different groups of users.\n\nGoogle spokeswoman Alex Krasov said \u201cwe know there is more work to be done and we\u2019re looking at ways to bring more political ads transparency to more regions and more types of elections.\u201d\n\nBig internet companies have been sharing more information around political advertising following scrutiny after U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russia had targeted American voters with social media content, including ads, to try and influence the 2016 election. Russia has denied the allegations.\n\nA Facebook spokesman said that the company had tightened its rules on political advertising in recent years and improved transparency on both Facebook and Instagram.\n\nTwitter did not reply to Reuters requests for comment on the new report.\n\nPrivacy International\u2019s criticisms come ahead of the European Commission\u2019s own report, due by the end of the year, on the tech companies\u2019 commitments to its self-regulatory Code of Practice on Disinformation.\n\nThe companies and trade bodies for the advertising industry signed up to the European Commission\u2019s voluntary measures in October 2018 to ward off more heavy-handed legislation.\n\nAs part of recent transparency efforts, Facebook, Twitter and Google have all launched searchable online libraries of political ads on their platforms, but these have been criticized by researchers for being poorly maintained and failing to provide useful ad targeting information.\n\n\u201cCompanies that rely on people\u2019s data to establish their market dominance should give all users heightened ad transparency, and transparency into the targeting and funding of ads should be meaningful,\u201d said Sara Nelson, a spokeswoman for Privacy International.\n\nThe new report singled out Google for not having defined what it considers to be \u201cpolitical issues\u201d, saying this rendered transparency into ads on such issues on the site less meaningful.\n\nIt also argued that as Twitter, outside of the United States, does not give the same level of transparency to \u201cpromoted tweets\u201d as it does to political ads, these paid-for tweets run without the heightened transparency they warrant.\n\nIn the United States, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner have been pushing for the introduction of the Honest Ads Act, which would require platforms to disclose the purchasers of ads, applying the same rules that exist for TV and radio.\n\n\u201cA patchwork of voluntary measures from tech companies isn\u2019t sufficient \u2014 we need to pass the Honest Ads Act,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement last month when tech company Snap, which owns disappearing messaging app Snapchat, released its own political ad spending data last month.\n\nSome platforms, such as Chinese company ByteDance\u2019s TikTok and photo-sharing site Pinterest, do not allow political ads on their platforms.", "description": "Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet's Google have failed to provide adequate transparency for global users around political advertising on their services, a privacy advocacy group said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436470348&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF92001-OCATC"}
