The vote reflected a rocky, scandal-plagued first term for the 47-year-old Mr. Trudeau, whose party failed to win a single seat in the western oil-rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in Monday\u2019s vote.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democrats, said Tuesday that he had already spoken with Mr. Trudeau on NDP priorities, including a program to pay for all prescription medicine through the country\u2019s national health care system, capping cell phone bills, waiving interest on student loans, \u201cending fossil fuel subsidies and reinvesting in clean, renewable energy,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Mr. Singh told his audience in British Columbia that he would make sure Mr. Trudeau raised taxes on the \u201csuper wealthy,\u201d his audience erupted in loud cheers and chants of \u201cTax the rich! Tax the rich!\u201d By contrast, Mr. Trudeau said little about his second term plans in his victory speech beyond a vague commitment to \u201cfight climate change\u201d and \u201cget guns off our streets.\u201d\n\nIn Monday night\u2019s election, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party won 157 of the 338 seats in Canada\u2019s Parliament followed by 121 seats for the Conservative Party, 32 for the Quebec-based Bloc Quebecois, 24 for the NDP and 3 for the Greens.\n\nPatrick Gossage, chairman of Media Profile Communications, said the NDP will push Mr. Trudeau to pass a prescription drug subsidy bill as one of their first priorities.\n\n\u201cIt will be really expensive but it will be very popular,\u201d Mr. Gossage said.\n\nJohn Wright, a partner of Dart C-Suite Communicators, said alienation in Canada\u2019s west and pressure from the left could drag Canada into a national unity crisis similar to the rise of Quebec separatism in the 1970s.\n\nAlberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and, to a lesser extent, British Columbia have been hard hit by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s failure to build a pipeline to take oil to sea ports on the coast and by China\u2019s $1 billion cut in its purchase of Canadian canola as a result of the legal battles over Huawei executive Meng Wangzhou. In the next government, the Liberal Party will have just one representative west of Ontario.\n\nCanada\u2019s Conservative Party actually won more votes than Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, but because their support was heavily concentrated in the less populated west, they elected fewer representatives. According to Mr. Wright, what doomed Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer was his boast just before Election Day that he would win a majority government.\n\nMr. Trudeau \u201cused that to spook progressive voters to vote Liberal instead of for the NDP or Greens to stop Mr. Scheer,\u201d Mr. Wright said.\n\nMr. Gossage also predicts Canada faces a polarizing political environment, with a government tacking left, rising conservative opposition, and Quebec sovereignists pushing to make their province a semi-autonomous state within Canada.\n\nThe challenge for Mr. Trudeau will be balancing the many political and economic forces pulling at Ottawa from different directions.\n\n\u201cHe needs to display a maturity he has so far had difficulty in showing,\u201d Mr. Gossage said. \u201cHe has to reinvent himself and take more serious advice if he wants to get through the next two years.\u201d\n\nJared Wesley, political science professor at the University of Alberta, said the left must be careful not to overplay its hand. The NDP cannot afford another election and so they must support the Liberal government, Mr. Wesley said. Mr. Trudeau can govern as if he has a majority government and turn his second mandate into one that advances social programs that benefit people across the country.\n\nBut the Conservative opposition said it was ready to exploit any sign of weakness in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s second term, given the declining vote share for the Liberals.\n\n\u201cConservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\u201d Mr. Scheer said. \u201cAnd Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
