(AP) - Stanford coach Jerod Haase didn\u2019t even name a captain last season because he could not find someone he thought deserved it.\n\nThis season, he is counting on someone to step up and lead the young Cardinal as they look to make strides in the deep Pac-12 Conference.\n\nEven if they are down players because of season-ending injuries, meaning walk-ons are being counted upon to help get the Cardinal through practices.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are down, certainly,\u201d Haase said. \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging to have a longer practice. I like the group.\u201d\n\nHaase has one potential candidate to take charge on the floor.\n\nHe will look to junior point guard Daejon Davis to lead the way after he ranked fourth in the Pac-12 for assists averaging 4.6 and also was seventh with 1.6 steals per game.\n\nThe Cardinal have been below 20 wins for each of the last four seasons and three of those since Haase took over.\n\nUNDERMANNED\n\nStanford is thin because of injuries.\n\nRedshirt junior Kodye Pugh, a 6-foot-8 forward who has played in 38 games his first two years on The Farm, is recovering from knee surgery after getting hurt playing during Stanford\u2019s foreign tour in Europe over the summer. He hopes to return for his senior season.\n\nPugh was injured Aug. 25 in Switzerland.\n\nIn addition, senior Trevor Stanback\u2019s college career is over because of medical reasons but he will remain part of the program as a student assistant coach.\n\n\u201cThe most important part for our team this year it\u2019s probably going to be health. Trevor Stanback is in a medical hardship and he\u2019ll be done, and he\u2019s helped out with the team but he won\u2019t be playing,\u201d Haase said. \u201c\u2026 From a numbers standpoint we\u2019re down, and we don\u2019t have a full complement of players necessarily. But having said that, the guys that we have, we\u2019re really excited about, but that goes back to the number one factor being injury prevention. If we can keep guys on the floor, I like what we have but we\u2019ve got to make sure we keep them out there.\u201d\n\nDAVIS\u2019 GROWTH\n\nAs Davis gains maturity and familiarity in the program, Haase knows he will find more consistency on both ends.\n\nHe averaged 11.4 points, 3.0 rebounds and 4.4 assists last season as a sophomore.\n\n\u201cI think his game is going to flourish as he has the stability on the court mentally, not getting too high or too low. He\u2019s as dynamic of a person as I\u2019ve ever been around, and when things are good, he can take an entire team with him to really good spots, and when he gets frustrated or struggles, he really takes the team with him some. And I think so far, he\u2019s really off to a great start with that stability part, and I think his game as he gets more and more consistent with handling adversity, I think his game is going to absolutely flourish.\u201d\n\nHE\u2019S GONE\n\nForward KZ Okpala departed after his sophomore season and was selected 32nd overall by the Miami Heat in the NBA draft, becoming Stanford\u2019s youngest player ever drafted.\n\nStanford will have to try to find scoring options with Okpala gone. He led the Cardinal at 16.8 points per game and averaged 5.7 rebounds. He was fifth in the Pac-12 in scoring, too.\n\nAlso gone is Josh Sharma, whose .673 field-goal percentage for a season was best in program history.\n\nYOUTH MOVEMENT\n\nLast season, 11 of Stanford\u2019s 15 players were freshmen or sophomores - one of the youngest rosters nationally.\n\nMore experience for that group should be a positive.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stanford coach Jerod Haase didn't even name a captain last season because he could not find someone he thought deserved it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/pac-12_media_day_basketball_70775_c0-216-5184-3240_s1200x700.jpg?48c42b2789ee0d08ce9a91ab8317603cc81a12f8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
