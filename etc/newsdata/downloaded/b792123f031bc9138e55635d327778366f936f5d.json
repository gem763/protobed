The 54-year-old, who is also a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, is appearing voluntarily.\n\nThe briefing will take place behind closed doors, the first of a series of events in the probe, none of them public, scheduled within the 10 days. More are expected.\n\nLate on Wednesday, U.S. Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the session with Volker, saying that Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans were not being given equal representation or the chance to question Volker.\n\nHe also expressed concern that U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic House foreign affairs chairman, had ceded oversight of U.S. foreign policy to the Intelligence Committee because that panel, he said, would lead the questioning of Volker.\n\nAn Intelligence Committee aide said the panel\u2019s staff would conduct the interview because Pelosi had designated it as the lead committee in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIntelligence Committee investigators have been working with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees, \u201cboth of which will have equal Majority and Minority representation,\u201d the aide said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the Foreign Affairs Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson will testify at an Intelligence Committee hearing. Marie Yovanovitch, who was the U.S. ambassador in Kiev until Trump recalled her in May before her normal term was up, will meet with committee staff on Oct. 11.\n\n\u2018PERFECT\u2019 - OR \u2018WRONG\u2019?\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, repeatedly calling his call with Zelenskiy \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nPelosi dismissed that characterization at a news conference on Wednesday, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect - it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s Republican allies have joined him in seeking to discredit Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence panel, after a New York Times report on Wednesday that the whistleblower had contacted the committee for advice on how to proceed.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats familiar with the process said, however, that Schiff\u2019s panel had acted properly in advising the person to contact an Inspector General and seek legal counsel.\n\nStaff from eight Senate and House congressional committees, including Republicans and Democrats, also reacted with surprise on Wednesday after a briefing by the State Department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick.\n\nAt the briefing, which was held behind closed doors but not classified, Linick handed out packets of documents that the only lawmaker who attended, Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, described as \u201cpropaganda and disinformation.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO - Kurt Volker, United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kiev, Ukraine October 28, 2017. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Picture\n\nCommittee staff members who attended the briefing said it concerned a package of documents delivered to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that included allegations against Biden and Yovanovitch.\n\nA photograph of one document, whose source was not disclosed, described a discredited theory promoted by Trump allies that Yovanovitch was installed in her post by billionaire George Soros, a Democratic donor frequently attacked by far-right activists.\n\nThe impeachment probe could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove Trump from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate. Republicans, however, have shown little appetite for ousting him.", "description": "A longtime U.S. diplomat who served as President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine will tell his story to congressional committee staff on Thursday as part of a Democratic-led impeachment probe of the Republican president.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436513916&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9208X"}
