There is going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nHe later contradicted himself, ruling out a quid pro quo in a statement from the White House.\n\nIn a July 25 call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for \u201ca favour\u201d to look into the server as well as the California-based cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC in 2016 to investigate hacking of Democratic emails that it later determined was done by Russia.\n\nTrump also asked Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political opponent, Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, who had served as a director for a Ukrainian energy company. Zelenskiy agreed during the call to carry out the investigation that Trump sought. The U.S. aid was later provided to Ukraine.\n\nThe DNC server issue is a discredited claim that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and that a Democratic Party computer server was being held somewhere in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence agencies and a special counsel investigation concluded that Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy.\n\nBiden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMulvaney said Trump did not like foreign aid, thought Ukraine was corrupt and was annoyed at how little \u201clethal aid\u201d European nations provided to Ukraine as it combated Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question,\u201d Mulvaney said, referring to Trump. \u201cBut that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption in that nation,\u201d Mulvaney said, referring to Trump.\n\nA reporter told Mulvaney that what he just described was a quid pro quo. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney responded.\n\nRelated Coverage Pentagon official won't testify Friday to House impeachment probe\n\nIn his later statement, Mulvaney offered a different account, saying: \u201cThere was absolutely no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump said he had a lot of confidence in Mulvaney.\n\nDemocratic members of the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry pounced on Mulvaney\u2019s earlier remarks.\n\nRepresentative Gerald Connolly said: \u201cI guess having failed at discrediting the facts of this case, they\u2019ve decided on a new tactic, which is to admit them and basically say: \u2018So what\u2019?\n\n\u201cThe answer to that is, well the \u2018so what\u2019 is you\u2019re going to be impeached because that\u2019s abuse of office. And extortion, the last time I checked, is still a crime,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. DIPLOMAT TESTIFIES\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments came after the U.S. ambassador to the European Union said in written testimony in the impeachment inquiry that Trump told senior U.S. officials to talk directly to his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, about U.S. policy in Ukraine, raising concern that the president was outsourcing American foreign policy to a private citizen.\n\nThe envoy, Gordon Sondland, told lawmakers in the Democratic-led inquiry that he did not understand \u201cuntil much later\u201d that Giuliani\u2019s agenda included a push for Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nHis testimony was the clearest sign yet that Trump\u2019s efforts to erect a firewall around the White House and frustrate the Democratic-led inquiry\u2019s efforts to interview administration officials are proving unsuccessful.\n\nMore testimony is expected next week, including from a top Pentagon official who oversees policy on Ukraine, two sources told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nIn prepared testimony, Sondland said he and two other officials - Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Ukraine Special Envoy Kurt Volker - were disappointed in Trump\u2019s May order, but they followed it anyway. Sondland said he felt foreign policy should be the work of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nTrump said on Thursday that Perry would step down as energy secretary by the end of the year, adding he had known for months that Perry would resign. The former Texas governor said previously he had no plans to resign. He faces a Friday deadline to turn over documents in the impeachment probe.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney answers questions from reporters during a news briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nSondland, a Republican Trump political donor and a wealthy Oregon hotelier before being named by the president to his EU post last year, also said that \u201cinviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong.\u201d\n\nHis testimony underscored the pivotal role of Giuliani in the Ukraine scandal. Before the president\u2019s July call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Giuliani had been working to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges - known as articles of impeachment - which would prompt a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. The Senate is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who have shown little inclination toward removing him.\n\nMAY 23 MEETING\n\nSondland said that on May 23, three days after Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration, U.S. officials who had attended debriefed Trump and key aides at the White House.\n\nThe ambassador said the officials taking part in the meeting emphasized the strategic importance of Ukraine and the importance of the relationship with Zelenskiy, whom he called a reformer planning to fight corruption.\n\n\u201cWe asked the White House to arrange a working phone call from President Trump and a working Oval Office visit. However, President Trump was sceptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his White House briefing, Mulvaney acknowledged that Trump had directed officials to work with Giuliani on Ukraine, and defended the move as proper. Mulvaney denied that there was a \u201cshadow foreign policy\u201d on Ukraine led by Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sondland\u2019s testimony.\n\nSondland is the latest witness to speak to lawmakers in the impeachment inquiry about his knowledge of efforts by the president to urge Ukraine to investigate Biden as lawmakers investigate whether Trump committed any \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Trump withheld the military aid to Ukraine before making the request.\n\n\u201cPlease know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nWhile he expressed misgivings in his testimony about Giuliani\u2019s role, other witnesses have described Sondland as being among a trio of senior U.S. officials who were considered more reliable than career diplomats in pressing Ukraine to launch investigations that might help Trump\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nTrump has accused the Bidens of corruption related to Ukraine, without offering evidence. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nSondland said he did not fully appreciate in late May what Giuliani\u2019s intentions were regarding Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign,\u201d Sondland said.", "description": "President Donald Trump's withholding of $391 million in military aid to Ukraine was linked to his request that the Ukrainians look into a claim - debunked as a conspiracy theory - about the 2016 U.S. election, a senior presidential aide said on Thursday, the first time the White House acknowledged such a connection.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442039163&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G25G", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
