Of course, in blackjack, there is always the story of a player who takes a \u201chit\u201d on 18, draws a 3 to get a 21, wins the hand and thinks he\u2019s a genius. In the home-selling context, you may hear about the seller who did absolutely nothing to prepare their home for sale, asked an outrageous price and ended up doing well. In both cases, those are the unicorns. Blackjack players and homeowners who don\u2019t know (or ignore) the odds do so at their peril.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen selling your home, the key is to understand the difference between what you can control (your marketing plan) and what you can\u2019t (the market) and to develop a strategy based on that difference.\n\nHere are a few ways to maximize your odds in the market:\n\n\u00b7 Presentation: How does your home show? Make sure that you do everything you can to have your home looking its very best. There are countless articles and books on staging, and most good agents and professional stagers can help you here. In short, though, think of it this way: Once you decide to sell, every dollar you invest in improving your home should have a positive return on your investment (ROI). Generally, cosmetic improvements tend to have the greatest ROI, while larger-scale infrastructure improvements (new windows, roof, HVAC system) have the lowest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u00b7 Photography: Virtually every buyer starts their search online. As with dating apps, if your photos are disappointing, buyers won\u2019t swipe right. Don\u2019t feel the need to show every room from every angle. Only use the photos that heighten the chances a prospective buyer will want to come see it for themselves.\n\n\u00b7 Promotion: Before going to market, make sure you understand who your likely buyers are and have a comprehensive plan in place to make them aware of the opportunity. Are you hitting the different marketing channels as powerfully as you can? What\u2019s your plan to reach real estate agents, neighbors, move-up buyers, downsizers, folks on social media and search engines, major employers, etc.?\n\n\u00b7 First impressions: You only have one opportunity to make a first impression, and that is almost always the time when your home will receive the most visitors and online traffic. Don\u2019t squander it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u00b7 Days on market: Time works against the seller. If a prospective buyer views a listing that\u2019s been on the market one day, that buyer will likely have a sense of urgency in making a decision. If that same buyer views the listing when the days on market (DOM) is, let\u2019s say, 90 days, that buyer might have an entirely different impression. They might question why it hasn\u2019t sold in the previous three months and wonder if they can get a great bargain. They will ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this property and will it be this hard for me when it\u2019s my turn to sell?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Pricing: Getting the highest price for your home is typically the ultimate goal for homeowners. Price too low and you may be leaving some money on the table. Price too high and your home may sit and become stale. The good news is that if you do all the other things listed above to the best of your ability, and your home still isn\u2019t selling, then you\u2019ve isolated price as the last variable.\n\nIf you focus on what you can control and learn from reality, you will make better decisions and maximize your chance of getting a satisfactory sale.\n\nSteve and Hans Wydler are associate brokers and founders of Wydler Brothers of Compass in McLean, Va., and Chevy Chase, Md.\n\nAD", "description": "Once you decide to sell, every dollar you invest in improving your home should have a positive return on your investment.
