That\u2019s all I have to say on the topic.\u201d\n\nOn top of widespread condemnation from Republican and some Democrat politicians, protesters in Hong Kong also filmed themselves burning the jersey of the 34-year-old Los Angeles Lakers star.\n\n\u201cYes, LeBron James is taking a lot of heat for not standing up against China and their oppression, with people even burning his jersey in Hong Kong,\u201d Noah began on Wednesday. \u201cWhich by the way, if the NBA kept statistics of most jerseys burned, I think LeBron would dominate that too.\u201d\n\nTONIGHT: People are burning LeBron\u2019s jersey in Hong Kong. Luckily he\u2019s used to it by now. pic.twitter.com/hBaclgIjKW \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cNormally I would agree that NBA players shouldn\u2019t have to know the intricacies of East Asia policy, but at the same time Dennis Rodman is basically the U.S. Ambassador to North Korea so I don\u2019t know what the rules are anymore,\u201d he continued.\n\nNoah added that he understood why people were disgusted by LeBron\u2019s comments, but pointed out that his motivation for refusing to criticize China\u2019s abysmal human rights record may have been to ensure his own personal safety rather than protect his own financial interests.\n\n\u201cI also understand why people think LeBron\u2019s comments were insensitive or misguided, but at the same time, I get where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause the Houston Rockets GM slammed China on Twitter while he was on his way to China, so LeBron was probably like \u2018Hey man, start this beef after I leave. What\u2019s wrong with you man?\u2019\n\n\u201cBecause I would do the same thing. If someone asked me about China\u2019s policies, I\u2019d say, \u2018I think China has policies,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the policies that allow me to fly home!'\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday on the same network, South Park slammed LeBron James, with Cartman echoing James\u2019 pandering China comments word for word.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "\"Daily Show\"\u00a0host Trevor Noah roasted NBA basketball star LeBron James over his defense of China's communist regime, admitting he understands why people found his comments both \"insensitive\" and \"misguided.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/noahlebron1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
