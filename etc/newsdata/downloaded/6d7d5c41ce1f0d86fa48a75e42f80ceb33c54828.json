One of those is Seth Haye, who helps manage $1.2 billion for the Oaks Group within Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n\nForbes dubbed Haye the best millennial wealth adviser in the US in 2019, and he has ranked high on similar lists for the past three years.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Haye said he always tried to impart these ideas to younger investors to help them decide what they want, and get ahead so they can fulfill those plans.\n\n1. Live beneath your means\n\nHaye feels that a lot of people take a backward approach to spending, figuring out how much they can afford to devote to necessities like a home and a car and luxury items based on how much income they're pulling in, he said. He warns younger clients in particular not to spend that way.\n\n\"You've got to be willing to adjust your cost of living early in life,\" he said. \"Once you get used to the nicer things, it's really tough to go to the things that aren't so nice.\"\n\n2. Prioritize, then plan\n\nHaye tells clients to decide what's most important in life, not just financially but also in personal and career terms. Only after they've figured out what they need can they craft a plan to achieve it.\n\nFor many of his younger clients, that first priority is saving up for a house. Broadly, Haye says a home is a worthwhile investment, even though the returns generally aren't huge. That's because the leverage buyers take on in the form of mortgage debt greatly improves their returns.\n\nRetirement planning tends to be high on the list as well, and Haye urges clients to start saving as early as they're able so they can benefit as much as possible as their returns compound over the years.\n\nRead more: A JPMorgan heavyweight who advises a $1.7 trillion business breaks down the perfect blend of international investment for the next 5 years \u2014 which he says will guard against a recession\n\n3. Make investing a game\n\nHaye recommends creating a new goal every year and trying to meet and then exceed it, and to treat that habit as something enjoyable instead of a chore. That makes it much easier to stick to a long-term plan.\n\nHe emphasizes that they should focus on the process of saving and investing and not just target a specific dollar amount in their investment accounts \u2014 because the market will have more control over that number than they do.\n\n4. Don't sweat over asset allocation\n\nInvesting strategy involves a lot of details and fine-tuning to maximize returns. In Haye's telling, younger investors should make a point of not getting lost in the weeds. The most important thing is to continue to save and invest as early as they're able.\n\n\"Don't get too hung up on the asset allocation and the individual stock selection,\" he said. \"That should be secondary to ... your ability to make these contributions each year early in your career, and dollar cost average into the market, and that's going to take away some of the general market risk.\"\n\n5. Be excited for bad news\n\nSince saving and investing is the goal, Haye tells his clients they shouldn't worry about market sell-offs. In his telling, by maximizing their retirement investments early on, their dollar cost averaging into the market early on, and a downturn early in their career, could mean bigger returns later.\n\n\"I try to get them to be excited for corrections and bear markets and recessions because that is usually where the real money is made,\" he said. \"You're going to have the opportunity, especially if you're really early in your career, to double the contributions to your portfolio or triple the contributions to your portfolio, and to buy many more shares while the market is cheap.\"", "description": "Seth Haye, just named the best millennial wealth manager by Forbes, explains how he gets young clients focused on long-term saving and investing.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94d5522d81630ba4081f1d?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
