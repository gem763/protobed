Some of the properties in the suit are owned by other companies but managed by Westminster.\n\nKushner Cos. was run by Jared Kushner before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, his father-in-law. Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner\u2019s father, has said his family firm has been unfairly targeted since his son became a key adviser to the president. In July, Trump attacked the Baltimore district of Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, describing it as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d Cummings died last week.\n\nThe suit, an administrative proceeding by the attorney general\u2019s Consumer Protection Unit, comes about a month after Laurent Morali, president of Kushner Cos., said Westminster had rejected an offer from Frosh to settle a long-running probe into how its tenants were treated, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe refuse to be extorted by an ambitious attorney general who clearly cares more about scoring political points than fighting real crime and improving the lives of the people of Maryland,\u201d Morali said. \u201cWe look forward to defending ourselves against these bogus allegations.\u201d\n\nA statement of charges in the suit describes \u201crodents living and dying in walls and kitchen appliances\u201d and cockroaches that have \u201ccrawled into consumers\u2019 food.\u201d Various plumbing problems cause \u201cwater-logged carpeting; holes in walls and ceilings; sagging, buckling and collapsing ceilings; and the stench of mildew and sewage,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nKushner Cos. has also battled Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, where the company wants to build a mixed-use tower. Fulop \u201chas expressly acknowledged to several people on the phone and in meetings that Kushner Companies is being unfairly and blatantly discriminated against by Jersey City simply because its former CEO works in the Trump administration,\u201d a spokeswoman told Bloomberg last year.\n\nIn New York, the company was targeted last year for failing to disclose rent-regulated tenants when applying for construction permits in Queens. The disclosure is required to protect such tenants from being forced out of their homes. In a statement at the time, the company said the filings were prepared by a third party.\n\n(Updates with details of allegations and with Kushner Cos.\u2019 view that it has been unfairly targeted)\n\n--With assistance from Andrew Harris.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Chris Dolmetsch in Federal Court in Manhattan at cdolmetsch@bloomberg.net;Caleb Melby in New York at cmelby@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Jeffrey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- An apartment management firm run by Jared Kushner\u2019s family was sued by Maryland\u2019s attorney general, who claims the company engaged in numerous \u201cillegal and harmful\u201d practices.Westminster Management lied about the quality of rental units and the level of maintenance the company would provide", "authors": ["Chris Dolmetsch", "Caleb Melby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IAJolgG3XuQ79RngZKUjnw--~B/aD0xMTc4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/454356eed2b697a146f992ed02712cff", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
