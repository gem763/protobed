You can read up on it as much as you want or talk to people but it might not prepare you for everything.\n\nSo one dad-of-three wrote to his past self about the things he ought to know.\n\nTed Gonder from Chicago, Illinois, wrote an open letter to his 24-year-old childless self about how to be a supportive partner during the \u2018becoming parents\u2019 phase.\n\nThe post immediately went viral, racking up 70,000 likes.\n\nWhile past Ted won\u2019t benefit from the wealth of knowledge, other partners were able to take heed of the words of advice and tagged one another in the comments.\n\nPoint number one on Ted\u2019s list read: \u2018Wifey carried baby IN her belly for nine months. So you carry baby ON your belly for nine months every chance you get.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Not only does it help her recover but it bonds you to your kid more than imaginable.\u2019\n\n\u2018You carry baby ON your belly for nine months\u2019 (Picture: Ted Gonder/Facebook)\n\nHe continued: \u2018Wifey is breastfeeding and \u2013 while beautiful and fulfilling for her \u2013 it\u2019s exhausting. So you change EVERY diaper you can. From diaper #1 onward.\n\n\u2018You will get over the grossness fast. And you will prevent imbalances and resentment in the relationship; in fact, when all your wife\u2019s friends are complaining about how absent and unsupportive their husbands are, your wife will be bragging about you.\u2019\n\nTed added that it\u2019s also important to bring her decaffeinated coffee in the morning as she may be tired from a lack of sleep and will need something to perk her up.\n\nMum comes up with brilliant headless ghost Halloween costume which cost nothing\n\nHe also acknowledged that pregnancy is a precarious time and may leave the mum with body image issues.\n\nHis advice went on: \u2018Tell her she is beautiful and help her see that in the moments when she is feeling most self-critical and hopeless about her body.\n\n\u2018Remind her of times when she achieved goals in the past. Remind her she is a superhero. She literally just moved all her organs around and gained 20 kilograms to give you a child that will be a gift to you for the rest of your life.\n\n\u2018Help her see past her body image issues and stay focused on a positive goal, one day at a time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sweet letter to other dads resonated with many as Ted encouraged them to share it among themselves.\n\n\u2018Remember your job is to be her rock through all of this,\u2019 he reminded them. \u2018So toughen up and keep perspective when her tongue is sharper than you know her best self intends.\n\n\u2018Normal will return soon and you want her to be grateful that you kept it together when she wasn\u2019t, not resentful and disappointed that you hijacked her emotions by making her problems yours.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s hope other dads are taking note.\n\nMORE: Dad leaves the room for 10 minutes, returns to find his three-year-old daughter has eaten 18 pots of yoghurt\n\nMORE: Dad shares important advice for new parents about helping their breastfeeding partner\n\nMORE: Mum and dad retire early after saving millions in just eight years\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Ted Gonder from Chicago, Illinois, wrote an open letter to his 24-year-old childless self on Facebook.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92892878_1572183847.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
