He said Mali had no plans to consider genetically modified cotton varieties, citing difficulties with the quality faced by neighbour Burkina Faso.\n\n\"We have options to increase our yields without resorting to genetically modified cotton,\" he added. \"We are currently Africa's top producer and we intend to stay that way.\"\n\nAnother member of the Malian delegation specified that research was underway on new varieties, without giving further details about them or when they would be introduced.\n\nThe so-called Cotton Four African producers - Mali, Chad, Benin and Burkina Faso - are meeting with other member states at the World Trade Organization in Geneva this week to discuss measures to promote trade. To show their commitment, most African delegates wore striped tunics made from homespun cotton.\n\nOne of the key topics they hope to address is the reduction or removal of state subsidies which they say create an uneven playing field for exporters.\n\nBoubacar said in a speech earlier on Monday that these subsidies amounted to $5.9 billion in 2017-2018, without naming the countries involved.\n\n\"The effect (of subsidies) is our producers, drawn most often from the most vulnerable layers of society, are increasingly precarious,\" he said. \"They are subjected to the injustice of subsidies in addition to unstable prices and the harmful effects of climate change,\" he added, referring to more frequent droughts in the semi-arid belt known as the Sahel.\n\nThe United States and Brazil are the world's top exporters of cotton, with C4 countries together ranking in fifth position with about 1 million tonnes in annual exports, a WTO document showed.\n\nProportionally cotton is a bigger contributor to African producers' budgets and they are also taking steps to encourage more investment in creating African textiles, rather than just exporting raw cotton.\n\nThe C4 countries met with other producers such as India and China on Monday to discuss subsidies. But an agreement stopped short of concrete steps, committing merely to \"intensify our discussions on factors negatively impacting cotton trade and markets,\" a statement said.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Mali sees cotton output at 1 mln T, urges action on subsidies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/cotton_3_800x533_L_1412670400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
