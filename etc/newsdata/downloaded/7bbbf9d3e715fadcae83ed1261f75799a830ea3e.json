Those hearings got underway in the Parliament for other nominees on Monday.\n\nVon der Leyen could, in theory, have tried to find a way to deal with the Parliament's concerns and then asked the legislature to reconsider the nominees. But, with her Commission due to take office in just over a month, she decided to cut her losses and ask Budapest and Bucharest to come up with new candidates.\n\nThe defeat puts an early dent in von der Leyen's authority as she seeks to establish herself in Brussels after a career in German politics. However, the speed with which she dropped the two nominees may fuel speculation that she was not particularly attached to them.\n\nMEPs voted by 13 to 7 to reject Plumb as \u201cunable to exercise\u201d her functions as transport commissioner. They gave a similar verdict against the candidacy of Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi.\n\nA Commission spokesperson said von der Leyen had been in contact with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Romanian Prime Minister Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 and \"expected to get new names\" from them.\n\n\"The candidates must be suitable and match the portfolios. If something doesn't fit, we may have to ask for new names,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBoth of the rejected nominees had been regarded as vulnerable, in part because their governments have tense relations with EU institutions, which have accused them of backsliding on democratic standards and the rule of law. However, the fact they were both ruled out before they even reached confirmation hearings from specialist committees came as a surprise.\n\nBoos from Bucharest\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103, the Romanian prime minister, accused President Klaus Iohannis and the country's opposition parties of campaigning against Plumb's nomination.\n\n\u201cI saw from the president and the opposition parties a limitless denigration campaign,\u201d she told in a press conference in Bucharest. She said Plumb \u201cwas subject to a political game.\"\n\nHowever, D\u0103ncil\u0103 said the government would propose another nominee. She declined to name any potential candidates. She also rejected an invitation from Iohannis to attend a consultation meeting with him on the nomination on Tuesday.\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103, a Social Democrat, is running in November's presidential election against Iohannis, a former leader of a center-right party who is seeking a second term.\n\nThe Hungarian government said in a statement that Tr\u00f3csanyi had helped defend Hungary from migration, and that as a result, pro-migration MEPs are opposed to his candidacy.\n\nAs for a new Hungarian candidate, one name that Orb\u00e1n suggested to von der Leyen is Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, currently Hungary\u2019s permanent representative to the EU, according to the Commission spokesperson.\n\nV\u00e1rhelyi is highly familiar with Brussels politics. He joined Hungary\u2019s foreign ministry in the mid-1990s and worked at the country's mission to the EU ahead of accession, and later in the permanent representation in various senior roles.\n\nHe is also a trained lawyer with experience working in Hungary\u2019s justice ministry, and did a stint at the Commission as head of unit responsible for industrial property rights at the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services.\n\nWhile formally a career civil servant, he is known as highly loyal to Orb\u00e1n and as an assertive advocate for the Hungarian government\u2019s political priorities in ambassadors\u2019 meetings.\n\nA senior official in Orb\u00e1n's right-wing Fidesz party predicted von der Leyen would back V\u00e1rhelyi but suggested the prime minister had taken a hit by having to abandon his first-choice nominee.\n\n\u201cI think she will accept him. He has been a diplomat, [he's] politically less vulnerable than anybody else. But I think this is a serious defeat for the PM,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nCommittee's concerns\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of the Parliament\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee on Monday, MEPs voted by 13 to 7 to reject Plumb as \u201cunable to exercise\u201d her functions as transport commissioner. They gave a similar verdict against the candidacy of Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, with 12 votes in favor of rejecting his candidacy as the future enlargement commissioner, and 9 votes against.\n\nThe vote clarified decisions from last week, when the committee made clear it had concerns about both candidates but did not explicitly state that they could not carry out the duties of a commissioner.\n\nPlumb was called before the committee last week to account for two loans worth nearly \u20ac1 million that she did not declare in her original financial declaration scrutinized by MEPs.\n\nThe committee in particular queried a donation of 800,000 Romanian lei (almost \u20ac170,000) she made to her Social Democratic Party through a loan from a \u201cphysical person operating professionally in the area of tourism.\" The MEPs said it\u2019s not clear how \u201cthis outstanding loan is to be paid back in an open and transparent manner,\u201d according to a letter sent to Parliament President David Sassoli last week.\n\nTr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, a former justice minister, came under scrutiny over links between a law firm he founded and work that it carried out for the Hungarian government.\n\nOn Monday, both Plumb and Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi sent letters to the committee chair attempting to answer the MEPs\u2019 concerns. But the panel was unimpressed.\n\nIn her letter, Plumb said she offered two apartments she owns in Romania to the creditor of the loan in question as a repayment, which the creditor accepted. \u201cConsequently the debt which generated your concern does not exist any longer,\u201d she wrote in the letter, seen by POLITICO.\n\nFormer Hungarian Justice Minister Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, meanwhile, defended his candidacy by sending MEPs a document, also obtained by POLITICO, with bullet points refuting the committee\u2019s concerns about his relationship with a law firm he founded in 1991 and what the committee termed his \u201cconnections to Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo payment of any kind has been disbursed to me by the firm since my current leave of absence that began in 2007, with a single exception: in May 2018, I withdrew my equity share in the firm at par value (which represented 12.6% of the firm\u2019s share capital at the time),\u201d Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi wrote.\n\nHe said a controversial decision he took to extradite suspected Russian arms dealers to their home country despite a U.S. extradition request \u2014 resulting in their release \u2014 was above board. \u201cRegardless of the possible political dimensions alleged by the Committee on Legal Affairs, the decision to extradite the Russian national to Russia was reached solely as a matter of law,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi also accused the Legal Affairs Committee of making a politically motivated decision to punish Hungary's government, which has clashed with Brussels on migration, the rule of law and other issues.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Committee\u2019s accusations are devoid of any factual basis despite the Committee\u2019s having been in possession of the above facts prior to making its statement, I must assume that its objections in fact relate to my former membership of Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government \u2014 a position which it cannot, however, take publicly,\u201d Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi wrote to MEPs.\n\nCarmen Paun contributed reporting.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Mobility.
