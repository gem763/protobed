Now some are afraid their own colleagues could squander it.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, multiple centrist lawmakers expressed concern that the caucus lacked clear messaging or strategy going forward, which could soon suck the air out of the move toward impeachment, according to multiple lawmakers and aides.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf you are asking us to stay on message, give us a goddamn message to stay on,\u201d Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) said in the private caucus meeting, according to multiple Democrats in the room.\n\nSlotkin, whose comments came after Speaker Nancy Pelosi had already left the meeting to deliver a televised statement endorsing an impeachment inquiry, was voicing a sentiment that quickly gained steam among the moderates.\n\nThat\u2019s particularly true of the vulnerable freshmen in GOP districts who took the impeachment plunge because of concerns with Trump\u2019s threat to national security and who now fear that Democrats plan to engage in another wonky process debate that will distract from the allegations of Trump's abuse of power.\n\nAnother first-term Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, raised a similar sentiment about Democrats losing focus on what led the party to this moment, after Pelosi and other key chairmen outlined a multi-step plan for their impeachment inquiry involving the six committees investigating Trump.\n\nSeveral moderates are also privately worried about members of their caucus going too far, with some progressives declaring prematurely that Democrats are ready to imminently impeach Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThey say they want the message focused squarely on Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden \u2014 an effort seemed designed to aid Trump\u2019s reelection \u2014 which Slotkin, Spanberger and five other freshmen described as a potentially \u201cimpeachable offense\u201d in a joint op-ed Monday night.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing but acknowledged he urged Ukraine to investigate the former vice president in a call with the country\u2019s president in July. Pelosi told her caucus it was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of his oath of office and warrants a full and \u201cexpeditious\u201d impeachment investigation.\n\nSeveral members praised the freshman members\u2019 op-ed and stressed that it should be the core of the message, according to multiple people in the room.\n\nDemocratic leaders are also emphasizing \"unity of message,\" with House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries urging members to \"resist the temptation however possible to take shots at each other publicly\" over process disputes.\n\n\n\nStill, moderates say they are worried that the narrative is already straying from the president\u2019s actions to where House Democrats stand on impeachment \u2014 the same scenario that they believe hurt the party as they attempted to use Robert Mueller\u2019s report against Trump earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe focus should be on what actually is happening, what the concern is, what led us to publish that op-ed,\u201d said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), one of seven freshman Democrats with national security resumes who backed impeachment proceedings in the op-ed.\n\nAs instructed by Pelosi, the multiple committee chairmen investigating Trump should present their best evidence to the House Judiciary Committee so that the panel can determine whether to draft articles of impeachment.\n\nBut the where, the when, the how of that strategy? It wasn\u2019t articulated by top Democrats, several lawmakers privately complained afterward.\n\nPelosi did emphasize at times that the caucus would focus on national security.\n\n\u201c[R]ight now, we have to strike while the iron is hot,\u201d Pelosi told lawmakers, according to a Democratic aide in the room. \u201cThis is a national security issue \u2014 a national security issue \u2014 and we cannot let him think that this is a casual thing, so that's where I'm at.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any event, our messaging is: the president admits to this,\u201d she instructed lawmakers, according to the aide, though many members had already left.\n\nPelosi added that Trump has betrayed \u201chis oath of office, our foreign policy, our national security and the integrity of our elections, therefore we are moving forward with this inquiry.\u201d\n\nRep.

Elaine Luria (D-Va.), added that she did believe Democrats\u2019 messaging focus going forward would be on Trump\u2019s blunt acknowledgment that he had spoken to Ukrainian leaders about Biden at the same time as he was withholding military aid from the country.\n\n\u201cThe sole focus is on this particular instance where the president solicited the assistance of a foreign leader in order to conduct an investigation to smear and malign his political opponent, ostensibly influence the outcome of our next election,\u201d Luria said.\n\nPelosi told members that she and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) planned to release a notecard with specific talking points after the meeting based on members' input.\n\nBut several Democrats said they had already expected a full set of talking points from leadership and the committees on such a pivotal day for the caucus. Many also wanted a specific timeline for action.\n\nLawmakers said they\u2019re concerned that by not singling out the Ukraine controversy \u2014 and aggressively pursuing an impeachment investigation based on that alone \u2014 they risk dragging out the process further, bumbling their message and losing the public\u2019s attention at a critical point.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done a great job as a caucus of communicating clearly what the real problem is and what we\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d Slotkin said later when asked about her remarks to the caucus.\n\n\u201cObviously we have a lot of investigations already ongoing. But I think it\u2019s important that we focus on this one,\u201d Slotkin added. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, it\u2019s understandable, it\u2019s strategic, and we need to bring along the country with us.\u201d\n\nWhile the caucus\u2019 most vulnerable members have been the most vocal, several other Democrats expressed similar concerns about the uncertain path ahead.\n\nMultiple Democrats said they\u2019re worried the impeachment investigation could turn into a mockery based on how the probe has progressed so far \u2014 from the circus surrounding Corey Lewandowski\u2019s testimony before the Judiciary panel last week to the antics from colleagues like Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and his fried chicken stunt when Attorney General William Barr stood them up earlier this year.\n\nModerates, in particular, said they were looking for Democratic leaders to adopt a clear and forceful message on Trump to match what they see as a watershed moment for the caucus.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no going back at this point. But going forward, we need to be in a mindspace where cooler heads prevail,\u201d one senior aide close to the moderate wing said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one shot to do this.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Centrist freshmen expressed concern behind closed doors that the caucus lacked clear messaging and strategy.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/13/c7/3ef720e54e6cbc36123323f62058/190924-luria-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
