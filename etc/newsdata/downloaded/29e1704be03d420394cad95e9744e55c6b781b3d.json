Traders also took positions ahead of the expiration of the October futures contract, feeding price volatility.\n\n\u201cWith the Saudis successful return of lost production that stemmed from the Sept. 14 attack on its oil facilities, crude prices are trading mainly on the oversupplied oil market outlook for 2020,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at Oanda.\n\n\u201cMuch of the recent global economic data paints weakness in all the major economies and that does no favors for the global demand outlook,\u201d he said. On Thursday, data showed that U.S. gross domestic product, the official score card for the economy, grew at a 2% annual pace from April to June, unchanged fro the previous estimate.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX19, -0.96% on Nymex lost 75 cents, or 1.3%, at $55.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while November Brent crude BRNX19, -0.54%, the global benchmark, was off 71 cents, or 1.1%, at $61.68 a barrel on ICE Europe.\n\n\u201cOil prices are approaching key support levels and if we see a hint of bearish momentum, it could get ugly,\u201d said Moya. \u201cFor oil to stabilize, it seems we need to see a geopolitical risk flare up, [Tropical Storm] Karen or [Hurricane] Lorenzo [in the Atlantic] to threaten production in the Gulf, or an interim U.S.-China trade deal that delivers a boost to sentiment and business investment.\u201d\n\nNews reports on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia had restored output capacity to 11.3 million barrels a day, more quickly than initially planned, after attacks on facilities earlier this month knocked production of more than 5 million barrels a day offline, sparking a sharp rally in crude prices.\n\nAs a result, \u201csupply risk premium has faded and focus has returned to the demand-side of the equation,\u201d said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, in a note. \u201cHowever, I remain concerned on how the U.S.-Iranian tensions play out in the next couple of weeks which means geopolitical risk premium may return to prices quickly.\u201d\n\nOil was pressured Wednesday after data from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude supplies rose for a second week in a row, up by a bigger-than-expected 2.4 million barrels.\n\nBack on Nymex Thursday, October gasoline RBV19, +0.66% shed 0.3% at $1.6175 a gallon, while October heating oil HOV19, -0.67% was off 1.4% at $1.9272 a gallon.\n\nAhead of its expiration at the day\u2019s settlement, October natural gas NGV19, -3.68% lost 8 cents, or 3.2%, to $2.422 per million British thermal units. November natural gas NGX19, -3.57% was at $2.44, down 7.8 cents, or 3.1%.\n\nThe EIA reported Thursday that U.S. supplies of natural gas rose by 102 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 20. The data were expected to show a build of 93 billion cubic feet, on average, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts.\n\n\u201cPrices have tumbled over the past week and a half on softening weather outlooks from [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[, which now call for cooler temperatures in the western half of the country from September 30 to October 9,\u201d said Christin Redmond, commodity analys t at Schneider Electric.", "description": "Oil futures decline Thursday, heading for a third straight session decline as news reports cite progress in restoring Saudi output following attacks on its...", "authors": ["Myra P.
