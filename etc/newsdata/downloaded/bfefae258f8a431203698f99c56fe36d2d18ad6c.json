That shift to a five-man defence has yielded a 1-0 win over Manchester United and a defeat by the same scoreline at Chelsea last weekend, but Bruce knows it has left the team lacking a goal threat.\n\n\u201cEvery goalscorer needs a bit of service, and that\u2019s the difficult part of the game,\u201d said Bruce, whose side take on Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday. \u201cWe have to try to get that.\n\n\u201cWe got ourselves into good positions at Chelsea and nothing came of it. We\u2019ve got to make better decisions and be more clinical. The decisions we made last week weren\u2019t good enough.", "description": "Steve Bruce has denied Brazilian striker Joelinton is a \u00a340 million flop even though he has managed just one goal for Newcastle United since his summer move from Hoffenheim.", "authors": ["Luke Edwards", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000212220146-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8Asj1eHb3tSpQqwok7bWeynuacdCSZqbWf5hpk60Bmc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
