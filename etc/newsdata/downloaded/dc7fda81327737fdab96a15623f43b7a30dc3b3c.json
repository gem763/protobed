Seventeen people were killed because of the weather, including a seven-year-old girl.\n\nThe researchers measured changes in pressure and sunlight across the north Atlantic and the jet stream, which blows at 200mph six miles above.\n\nThey hope their extended forecast will help the UK anticipate the upcoming risk and plan ahead.\n\nThe coldest winter in three decades could follow closely on the heels of the highest-ever UK temperature, recorded as 38.7C at Cambridge University Botanic Garden on 25 July.\n\nForecaster Craig Snell said the Met Office could only give a long-range forecast for autumn up to the end of November.\n\nHe told The Independent: \u201cNext month it will start going into winter. The trends at the moment look like temperatures and rainfall as a whole will come out just above average. The average maximum temperature for the UK is about 12C and we expect about 325mm of rain.\u201d", "description": "Britain is facing a new Beast from the East\u00a0in what could be one of the coldest winters in 30 years, climate experts say.
