This could prove a big exclusion considering the state\u2019s current $100 billion infrastructure boom.\n\nThis exemption is in line with the Andrews government's election commitments.\n\nA second set of guidelines stops the Victorian public service hiring external labour unless recruitment attempts have been unsuccessful or will likely be, an existing public sector employee is on leave, or temporary backfill is required.\n\nAny hires are capped at 12 months unless the role is critical to business and attempts at recruitment failed, and secretary approval is again needed for any labour hires.\n\nFollowing NSW's example\n\nThe NSW Coalition government capped the maximum daily rate it will pay a consultant at $4000 as part of its plan to cut whole-of-government administrative and procurement costs by $731.4 million over forward estimates, The Australian Financial Review revealed last month.\n\nThe capped rates were introduced in mid-2016 and the big four consulting firms Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC quickly signed up to limit their rates to that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS strategy consultancies McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group both refused to comply with the lower fees. The $4000 cap for strategy partners would be a significant cut for McKinsey, which charges the federal government up to $16,000 a day before discounts for some senior partners. KPMG charges the federal government up to 50 per cent more for partners.\n\nNSW's FY2018 consulting bill\n\nNSW's Berejiklian government clocked up a $41.4 million bill across the big four firms for the 2018 financial year, according to Treasury documents obtained by the Financial Review.\n\nPwC earned the most at almost $13 million. The brunt of this came from just two areas: $4.9 million from the Crown Finance Authority and $4.1 million from the Treasury.\n\nThe government spent $12.2 million with EY, formerly Ernst & Young, across 15 departments. The biggest spend was $3.7 million by the State Insurance Regulatory Body. KPMG had the next highest bill at $9.3 million, with almost a quarter coming from work for the Department of Justice.\n\nDeloitte earned the least from the government of the big four at almost $7 million, but was engaged by 16 departments, the most of any consulting firm.\n\nOf the global strategy firms, the Boston Consulting Group earned the most from NSW taxpayers. The government spent $4.7 million with BCG, compared to $1.4 million with McKinsey.\n\nThe Berejiklian government also spent $6.3 million with CapGemini Consulting and over $500,000 with Accenture and domestic consulting outfit Nous Group.", "description": "The use of consultants now requires secretary-level sign-off under the Andrews government, and the outsourcing of professional services labour is also tightening.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2312%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_31/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0347ae22f1fda554ea0e6f8b79da8f463d0453d0", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
