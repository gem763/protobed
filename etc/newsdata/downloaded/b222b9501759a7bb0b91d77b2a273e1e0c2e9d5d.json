Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nIran\u2019s ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, had said in a Twitter post on Monday that the vessel was free to leave after legal hurdles had been cleared.\n\n\u201cThe detention order on Stena Impero had been lifted and the vessel is going through the proceedings to leave Bandar Abbas\u201d port, Mohammad Rastad, head of Iran\u2019s Ports and Maritime Organization, was quoted as saying on Tuesday by the semi-official news agency ILNA.\n\n\u201cShe has moved during her time there to get fresh water, among other things, but is still in Bandar Abbas,\u201d Hanell said in a text message, adding he had no information as to why the ship had not left Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s seizure of the Stena Impero on July 19 for alleged marine violations, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, ratcheted up tensions in the region following attacks on other merchant vessels which Washington blamed on Tehran. The Iranian vessel was released in August.\n\nIran has denied responsibility for those attacks, which took place along a vital international oil shipping route.\n\nRelations between the United States, its allies and Iran have become more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact to rein in Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and imposed sanctions on the country that were aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.\n\nAsked about accusations that Iran had taken the British tanker hostage, Rastad said: \u201cThere is no hostage-taking. According to the law, the ship was detained because of violations, and... the rules are to first impose a detention order and then investigate the violations and issue a ruling,\u201d ILNA reported.\n\nAn Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that all legal steps had been taken for the release of the tanker, Iranian media reported.\n\n\u201cThe legal work and administrative procedures for the release of the English tanker have been completed but I have no information on the time of the release,\u201d said spokesman Ali Rabiei, according to semi-official news agency ILNA.", "description": "British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, detained by Iran in July, remains in that country even as Iranian officials have said it was free to leave, Erik Hanell, chief executive of the tanker's Swedish owner Stena Bulk said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433265611&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0K4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
