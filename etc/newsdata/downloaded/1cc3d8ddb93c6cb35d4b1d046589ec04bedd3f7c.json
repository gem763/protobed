However, founder and CEO Jay Bregman (who previously founded ridesharing company Hailo) said that thanks to customer demand, the team kept adding insurance for different types of businesses \u2014 and now it\u2019s rebranding to reflect that broader vision.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to talk about Thimble customers as being part of the \u201cgig economy,\u201d Bregman noted that these aren\u2019t just people driving for Uber or delivering for Postmates \u2014 only 4% of the company\u2019s customers identify as gig economy workers.\n\n\u201cThere is this larger thing called the gig economy: People working in flexible ways, on their own terms,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Thimble now says it provides liability coverage for customers in more than 100 professions, including handymen, landscapers, DJs, musicians, beauticians and dog walkers. Policies can be purchased directly from the Thimble website or app by the hour, day, week, month or year.\n\nThe idea, Bregman said, is that as work becomes shorter term and \u201cmore transactional,\u201d it doesn\u2019t make sense to buy an annual insurance policy. To illustrate that point, he noted that 75% of customers didn\u2019t have insurance before buying from Thimble, and that 50% of customers are buying policies to cover a single day or less. And the company says it\u2019s on-track to sell 100,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThimble\u2019s policies are underwritten by Markel, an insurance company that Bregman praised for its \u201cinfrastructure and talent.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, \u201cWe have always been the owner of the product itself. Basically, we worked with carrier partners to bring [our products] to market; the way we do that may evolve slightly as we get older and more mature.\u201d\n\nThimble has received regulatory approval to sell insurance in 48 states so far. Asked whether the broader political debates about whether gig workers are employees could affect the company\u2019s business, Bregman pointed again to the fact that the vast majority of Thimble customers don\u2019t consider themselves gig workers.\n\n\u201cOur only fear here is that in trying to solve a very particular problem with long-term gig employment, that some of these laws may actually unintentionally scare off or capture legitimate freelancers,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the investment, IAC\u2019s chief strategy officer Mark Stein acknowledged that the digital media holding company doesn\u2019t make many early-stage, minority investments. But he said that deals like this are about \u201cplanting seeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we think about at IAC is: How can we go about planting seeds of growth for the future? What will become the next ANGI Homeservices? What will become the next Match Group?\u201d Stein said, alluding to two IAC-owned businesses that may get spun off. \u201cWe need to find these kinds of large, addressable market opportunities now in the hopes of creating very large, industry-changing companies in the future.\u201d\n\nPrevious investors Slow Ventures, AXA Venture Partners and Open Ocean also participated in the round, bringing Thimble\u2019s total funding to $29 million.", "description": "Thimble, which offers flexible, short-term insurance to small businesses and freelancers, is announcing that it has raised $22 million in a Series A funding round led by IAC.
