It might be just inartful, and just a clerical discrepancy.\u201d\n\nPerry, however, declined to comment on what the two leaders allegedly discussed during the parts of the call left out of the official White House summary. He refused to confirm reports that Vindman said Trump referred to recordings of Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine and that Zelensky mentioned Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy firm on whose board Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat.\n\n\u201cI'm not allowed to divulge what was said in the hearings for \u2014 because of a potential ethics violation,\u201d Perry said, adding: \u201cI don't think that that part was part of his opening statement, so I got to be careful what I talk about the particulars there. So I just can't get into that.\u201d\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy asking for a briefing on how Vindman is being protected after conservative media, Trump and Rudy Giuliani attacked him publicly after his testimony. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that \u201cthis vitriol \u2026 may result in professional reprisals and threats to his personal safety and that of his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent on the Army to ensure that he is afforded the same protections as whistleblowers and protected from reprisal for testifying before Congress,\u201d Schumer wrote.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1e/01/905ef9534f8aba5cd449769d4b80/191030-scott-perry-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
