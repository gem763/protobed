The anger over this company\u2019s spectacular collapse is raw, and entirely justifiable.\n\nWhile bosses, chief executive Peter Fankhauser in particular, are at the front of the queue when it comes to apportioning blame, there\u2019s plenty around to be shared. Considering the UK\u2019s competition regulator recommended a major shake-up of accountancy earlier this year \u2013 and the scrutiny faced by the Big Four firms and their auditors \u2013 an investigation into EY\u2019s performance with respect to Thomas Cook was inevitable. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has duly announced one.\n\nIn this year\u2019s interim results, the firm warned there was \u201csignificant doubt\u201d about whether the holiday outfit could continue as a going concern. But the investigation isn\u2019t going to look at Thomas Cook\u2019s final months. Rather it will focus on the work done for the year ending 30 September 2018. The annual report covering that period contains notes about challenges being raised by Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors and adjustments being required to its reporting as a result of them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the auditors signed the business off as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d having \u201cassessed that the severe but plausible scenarios identified by management are reasonable\u201d. With the firm now having ceased trading, it seems those scenarios weren\u2019t severe enough. EY issued only a bland statement in response to the FRC\u2019s announcement, saying that it would be fully cooperating with the investigation while opining that any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.\n\nThere was none of the \u201cwe have confidence in our audit\u201d as has sometimes happened when members of the Big Four have been challenged over their work. Perhaps that\u2019s wise. It wouldn\u2019t look good to be getting punchy amidst the carnage. EY\u2019s bosses must know that the firm is in a tricky spot. The FRC has been repeatedly, and justifiably, criticised for being too soft. Its investigators have a duty to consider the evidence and nothing more. External factors aren\u2019t supposed to matter.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the realpolitik. They will be under huge pressure to pursue this particular investigation aggressively. It bears repeating at this stage that EY is not responsible for the collapse of Thomas Cook. At issue is its oversight and whether it provided sufficient challenge to the company\u2019s bosses. This is an important point, but not one many people are going to want to pay much attention to.\n\nWorking against the firm and its peers in similar situations is a long history of corporate collapses in which auditors have sometimes looked as if they were barely paying attention to what was going on under their noses. This is going to be one of many investigations. They can be counted upon to leave a trail of devastation in their wake. Some big reputations are going to go down, if they haven\u2019t already done so.\n\nThe thing is, is anyone going to suffer to the same extent as the low-waged staff turning up to help when they\u2019d almost certainly be better off looking to their futures? Probably not. Their dedication and self sacrifice will only serve to highlight the failures of their bosses and perhaps their advisers. The FRC will have the final word on the latter.", "description": "With the horror stories of Thomas Cook\u2019s holidaymakers all over the media amid\u00a0a massive repatriation programme that has seen the tour operator\u2019s staff turning up\u00a0for free to assist, attention is now turning to who is to blame.
