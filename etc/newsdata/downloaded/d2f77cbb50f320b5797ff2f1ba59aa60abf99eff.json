In his speech, Barr portrayed \u201csecularists\u201d as enemies of American democracy. Yet few seem to have grasped the deeper political significance of Barr\u2019s remarks.\n\nCult of Beyonc\u00e9: how the star inspired a new wave of Christian worship Read more\n\nOn their face, none of Barr\u2019s claims appear particularly new. The idea that \u201cmilitant secularism\u201d undermines the moral fabric of society, leading to all sorts of \u201csocial pathologies,\u201d and the idea that \u201cfree government\u201d requires the \u201cmoral discipline\u201d afforded by religious belief, have been central tenets of official Catholic doctrine for at least a century and a half.\n\nWhat is more original \u2013 and troubling \u2013 is the political use the US\u2019s chief law-enforcement officer has made of these traditional religious themes. By subtly reworking some of the core tenets of Catholic social doctrine, he has constructed a new political theology in the service of Trumpism \u2013 one which aims to offer conservative Christians a set of principled, not just pragmatic, reasons for supporting the current US administration.\n\nThree intellectual moves define this new political theology. First, by describing \u201csecularists\u201d as engaged in an \u201cunremitting assault on religion and traditional values\u201d, Barr presented an American majority group (self-identified Christians) as a victimized social group. This feeds into Trump\u2019s broader appropriation of the logic of identity politics, which has converted it into a tool for defending the interests of previously dominant social groups by tapping into anxieties about \u201ccultural replacement\u201d.\n\nSecond, by establishing an equivalence between morality and religion, and between religion and Christianity (or, as he sometimes also put it, \u201cJudaeo-Christian values\u201d), Barr excluded two key social groups from the remit of those he deemed capable of \u201cfree government\u201d: non-believers and non-Christians. For anyone keyed into the mainstays of Trump\u2019s discourse, it should be clear who is here being stigmatized as a \u201cthreat\u201d, not just for religion but for American freedom in general: urban elites and recent immigrants. Take these two groups out and you have a pretty good cross-section of Trump\u2019s electorate.\n\nFinally, by talking of a \u201cwreckage of the family\u201d, \u201crecord levels of depression and mental illness\u201d and \u201can increase in senseless violence\u201d, Barr also echoed the idea of an \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d employed by Trump during his inaugural address to present himself as a providentially ordained \u201csavior\u201d called upon to re-establish \u201corder\u201d and \u201ccivility\u201d.\n\nAlthough Trump \u2013 a twice-divorced former pro-choicer \u2013 might seem an unlikely champion for this religious mission, Barr also implicitly appealed to the biblical theme of the \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d, which has been widely used by evangelical Christians to justify their support for the current president. While jokingly telling the story of the rocambolesque way in which Trump informed him about his nomination, he also made sure to reassure the audience that: \u201cAs long as I am attorney general, the Department of Justice will be at the forefront of [the] fight for the most cherished of our liberties: the freedom to live according to our faith.\u201d\n\nFaced with this sweeping set of theologico-political moves, the objection that Barr\u2019s speech violated the principle of separation of church and state appears rather toothless, since it merely reaffirms an article of liberal faith against a conservative theology that doesn\u2019t recognize any of its premises.\n\nAfter all, Barr himself shrewdly alluded to the fact that there is a plausible reading of the \u201cnon-establishment\u201d clause of the American constitution, which suggests that the matter should simply be left for states to legislate upon, since several states still had established religions at the time the first amendment was written. He also mentioned that many of the framers of the constitution explicitly believed that: \u201cOur constitution was made only for a moral and religious people; it is wholly inadequate for the government of any other\u201d, as John Adams put it.\n\nGiuliani associates plead not guilty to illegal campaign finance charges Read more\n\nA more powerful retort to Barr\u2019s speech would therefore be to point out that it is ultimately in contradiction with itself, since it runs counter to other key themes of Catholic and \u2013 more broadly \u2013 Christian theology. Most notably, the fact that Christianity was never intended to function as an exclusive identity, marking out the boundaries between those deemed fit for \u201cfree government\u201d and those that aren\u2019t. On the contrary, the core of the Christian message is one of universal inclusion.\n\nThis is precisely the meaning of the New Testament\u2019s affirmation that: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor gentile, neither slave nor free, nor male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Galatians 3:28). The same point was also recently reiterated by Pope Francis when he reminded believers that \u201cCatholicity\u201d literally means \u201cuniversality\u201d, inferring from it that: \u201cThe church shows her catholicity by \u2026 liv[ing] in solidarity with all of humanity, and never closed in on ourselves.\u201d\n\nRecovering this universalist core of the Christian message is essential to breaking the unholy alliance between religious conservatism and Trump\u2019s brand of authoritarian nationalism. Unless Trump\u2019s opponents are able to persuade the religious right that there is something profoundly anti-Christian in the political theology of Trumpism, it seems pretty unlikely that the next presidential election will yield a result different from the previous one.", "description": "Bill Barr\u2019s \u2018secularists\u2019 speech runs counter to key themes of Catholic, and more broadly, Christian theology", "authors": ["Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61c38bc25dd2a670e949de986e10deea9a9cbe11/0_0_3043_1826/master/3043.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2b9fe7da3e257ce9ff1cee3371921548", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
