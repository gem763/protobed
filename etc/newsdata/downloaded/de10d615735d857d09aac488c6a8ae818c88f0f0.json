Inadvertently, the administration also sent the document to some House Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDuring a panel discussion, the majority of the co-hosts downplayed the revelations that the president did indeed press Ukraine to look into Biden and work with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. That prompted Williams to bring up the publication of the White House\u2019s talking points.\n\n\u201cI think, you know, just listening here, boy, those talking points, they have made the rounds,\u201d the liberal commentator stated. \u201cBecause the reality is\u2014\u201d\n\nImmediately, both Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld interrupted him, asking Williams what he was implying.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Gutfeld shouted. \u201cAre you saying I got talking points?! You got to answer to the accusation!\u201d\n\nWatters added: \u201cAre you telling me I was told what to say?\u201d\n\nThe progressive Fox Newser pointed out that he was hearing that \u201call around,\u201d causing Gutfeld to complain that Williams had already had enough time to talk and it was time to give co-host Katie Pavlich some airtime.\n\nWilliams, however, went back to criticizing the president\u2019s actions laid out in the call, leading Gutfeld to grumble and ask his colleague: \u201cDid you get that from Media Matters, Juan?\u201d\n\nWatters and Gutfeld kept badgering Williams over his apparent accusation as he attempted to finish his point about the call. Williams, for his part, struggled on until Gutfeld finally snapped at him.\n\n\u201cJuan, you\u2019ve had two days to talk about it, Katie hasn\u2019t been able to say a word,\u201d Gutfeld, arms crossed, seethed. \u201cYou were on this show yesterday and we weren\u2019t. You had your shot!\u201d\n\nAs for the White House talking points, it wasn\u2019t just the opinion side that appeared to be embracing them\u2014a number of the network\u2019s \u201chard news\u201d reporters and anchors also appeared to echo them throughout the day.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
