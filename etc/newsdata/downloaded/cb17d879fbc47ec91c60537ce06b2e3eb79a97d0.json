In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump's government cut the country's corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 per cent.\n\nChristopher Ragan, an associate professor of economics at McGill University, told the Canadian Press that Singh is being misleading when he implies only the rich will benefit from the move.\n\n\"It's not just about private jets and limousines,\" he said. \"It's about driving investment in the economy, which drives growth and drives productivity.\"\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May\n\nThe claim: \"I'm very pleased that we are the party standing on stage today that has a full platform, has the budget numbers publicly accessible and approved as a budget that passes muster by Kevin Page and the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Democracy.\"\n\nThe facts: The Green Party was the first in the current campaign to attach a price tag to its platform. The initial costing was not particularly well-received by many economists. One consistent criticism was that the party's fiscal outlook was reliant on highly uncertain revenue projections.\n\nKevin Page is a former Parliamentary Budget Officer who now heads the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa. Throughout the campaign, Page and his team have been independently evaluating the fiscal merits of the party's platforms.\n\nHe initially gave the Greens' plan a failing grade. The party then revised its platform costing and provided Page with additional information about its baseline economic assumptions.\n\nThe updated platform submission got a passing mark for its more realistic projections and overall transparency, though Page said it was still wanting when it comes to \"responsible fiscal management.\"\n\nThe re-evaluation by Page and his team means May's claim is mostly true, but there are still questions about the long-term sustainability of the Greens' proposed measures for fiscal sustainability.", "description": "A round up of\u00a0fact checks on some of the most notable claims made during the debate.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312922.1570508294!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/federal-leaders-debate-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
