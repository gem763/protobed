France proposed economic sanctions on Turkey, an ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), while Sweden's parliament demanded an EU arms embargo.\n\nFurther piling pressure on Ankara ahead of an EU foreign ministers' meeting on Monday and a summit of EU leaders on Thursday, Cyprus and Greece urged economic sanctions against Turkey over Turkish gas drilling in waters off southern Cyprus.\n\nA senior EU official said the EU was spending six billion euros ($6.63bn) on supporting the Syrian refugees currently living in camps inside Turkey, adding that \"to use this as leverage is totally unacceptable\".\n\nAnkara says the aim of its military operation in Syria is to defeat the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which it sees as linked to Kurdish separatists in Turkey. It says it wants to create a \"safe zone\" to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil - and that Europe should pay for it, a plan the EU has rejected outright.\n\nThe YPG is the main fighting element of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the principal ally of the US in Syria against the ISIL group. US Republican lawmakers have joined their Democrat opponents in criticising US President Donald Trump's decision to pull US troops from the region and are now discussing sanctions against Turkey over its offensive.\n\nSanctions\n\nBrussels relies on Ankara to curb the arrival of refugees into Europe following a 2016 agreement to seal off the Aegean Sea route after more than one million people entered the bloc.\n\nFrance's European affairs minister said Paris wanted next week's EU summit to specifically discuss sanctions over Turkey's offensive in northern Syria.\n\n\"We will not remain powerless when faced with a situation that is shocking for civilians, the SDF and the stability of the region,\" French Secretary of State for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin told the France Inter radio network, adding that the possibility of sanctions was \"on the table\".\n\nSo far, EU discussions of sanctions on Turkey have focused on Turkish oil and gas drilling off Cyprus and on the targeting of specific individuals and companies.\n\nBut a French diplomatic source said Europe would look \"absurd\" if the option of sanctions over Ankara's offensive was not discussed. The source said EU foreign ministers would discuss the issue at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\n\"We can't just limit it [the sanctions talk] to drilling, and there are similarities on both issues,\" the source added.\n\nThat could lay the ground for EU leaders to weigh sanctions and possibly impose them, although any decision needs consensus and EU diplomats cautioned that many governments were wary of further angering Erdogan, given Turkey's size and importance.\n\nHungary, which has refused to take in people fleeing Syria's eight-year civil war, is against sanctions and blocked an EU statement on Wednesday criticising Turkey, two diplomats said.", "description": "The European Union has condemned Turkey's actions in Syria and Erdogan's threats to send refugees to Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/dbfdb01899594d87b5590410c3290ba1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
