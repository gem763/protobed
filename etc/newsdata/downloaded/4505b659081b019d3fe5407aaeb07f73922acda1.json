REUTERS/Djordje Kojadinovic\n\nThe air and land offensive has prompted alarm among opponents and allies of Turkey who say it could harm the campaign against Islamic State, worsen Syria\u2019s humanitarian crisis and further complicate the eight-year conflict.\n\nErdogan said the operation against U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters would allow Syrian refugees to return \u201cto their own homes\u201d and promised that Islamic State prisoners being held in northeast Syria would not escape.\n\n\u201cThey are not honest, they just make up words,\u201d Erdogan said in blistering speech in which he hit back at critics of the operation. \u201cWe, however, create action and that is our difference.\u201d\n\nSingling out the European Union and Arab powers Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which both condemned Turkey\u2019s operation, Erdogan said they should \u201cstep aside\u201d and let Turkey get on with the battle.\n\n\u201cLet me start with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Erdogan told members of his AK Party in the Turkish capital Ankara. \u201cLook in the mirror first. Who brought Yemen to this state?\u201d he asked, referring to Riyadh\u2019s military intervention in Yemen\u2019s ruinous civil war.\n\n\u201cDid tens of thousands of people not die in Yemen?\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s troubled relations with Saudi Arabia were further strained last year by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nTies with Cairo have also been poor since the Egyptian army toppled Erdogan\u2019s ally, Muslim Brotherhood president Mohammed Mursi, in 2013.\n\nMursi, Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected head of state, died in July of a heart attack after collapsing in a Cairo court while on trial on espionage charges.\n\n\u201cEgypt, you can\u2019t talk at all. You are a country with a democracy killer,\u201d Erdogan said. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi \u201cheld a meeting with some others and condemned the operation - so what if you do?\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER\u2019\n\nAddressing the European Union, which Turkey still formally aspires to join despite mounting EU criticism of Ankara\u2019s human rights record, Erdogan said the 28-member bloc had never been sincere with his country and warned it would face severe consequences if it portrayed Turkish actions negatively.\n\n\u201cHey, European Union, pull yourself together. If you try to label this operation as an occupation ... we will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey hosts 3.6 million Syrians. Under a deal agreed in 2016, the EU has provided billions of euros in aid in return for Ankara stemming the influx of migrants into Europe, but Turkey says the money was slow to materialise and paltry next to the $40 billion it says it has spent.\n\n\u201cWe invite those who close their eyes to all other developments and criticise Turkey to be mindful instead,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey says its operation aims to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d along 300 miles of border, driving back Kurdish YPG fighters that it considers terrorists because of their links to militants waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nIt says the zone could also be used to settle refugees it is currently hosting.\n\nErdogan said that once Turkey takes control in northeast Syria, Islamic State \u201cwill not be able to establish a presence in the region. I want to give this guarantee to the world\u201d.\n\nAs a top Syrian Kurdish official said that Turkish attacks were weakening the ability of forces in northeast Syria to guard prisons holding Islamic State detainees, Erdogan said Turkey was able to handle the situation.\n\n\u201cWe will keep in prison those who need to be kept in prison and we will send back those who are accepted by the countries of which they are citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan also reiterated plans, which have been met with deep scepticism from the United States and Europe, to settle more than 1 million refugees in northeast Syria.\n\nWestern countries fear that the project would involve moving Sunni Arab Syrians into mainly Kurdish regions of the northeast. But Turkey says any demographic changes would only correct steps taken by the region\u2019s Kurdish authorities.\n\n\u201cArabs, Turkmen, Kurds and all other ethnic groups will return to their homes,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that Turkey would build housing for 1 million who no longer have homes. \u201cWe plan on doing this with international funding\u201d.", "description": "President Tayyip Erdogan delivered a fiery defence of Turkey's military incursion into northeast Syria on Thursday, dismissing a chorus of global criticism and threatening to send more than 3 million Syrian refugees into Europe.", "authors": ["Nevzat Devranoglu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439303572&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990T9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
