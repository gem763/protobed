Those interested can sign up for updates here.\n\nIt's a sign of how the streaming war is heating up. Disney Plus launches on November 12 for $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year, while Apple's competitor, Apple TV Plus, will launch on November 1 for $4.99 a month. Those who buy a new Apple product receive a free year of the service.\n\nVerizon's offer isn't the first deal to reel in potential Disney Plus members. Disney offered a discount in August to new and existing members of its official fan club, D23. The deal offered a three-year Disney Plus subscription for $47 per year ($141 for three years), which is 33% off the original yearly price and amounted to less than $4 a month. High demand for the deal caused the D23 website to crash.\n\nDisney Plus will include content across its popular properties, from Marvel to Pixar. The service will include original movies and TV shows, including \"The Mandalorian,\" the first live-action \"Star Wars\" series, at launch. Every \"Star Wars\" movie will be available, including the original trilogy, but not every Marvel Studios movie.\n\nDisney is investing heavily in the service and is projecting a 2020 original programming budget \"short of $1 billion,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.", "description": "The offer is available to new and existing Verizon Wireless customers, and new Fios Home Internet and 5G Home Internet customers.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf13694af9097f3a7da4f7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
