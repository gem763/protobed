And they came up with 'Philausophy ?' FFS...,' said another.\n\nA number of critics also referred to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who was the Managing Director of Tourism Australia between 2004 and 2006.\n\nMr Morrison oversaw the controversial yet successful 'So where the bloody hell are you?' tourism campaign in 2006 which featured model Lara Bingle.\n\n'Stuff up. Who the bloody hell thinks these absurd things up? Morrison's incompetent hands all over it... I just cringe in embarrassment,' one person said in reference to the new ads.\n\n'Is Uncle Morrie still working for Tourism Australia on the side? That tag is ridiculously dumb. It's half an idea, that they couldn't quite finish, so went with anyway,' said another.\n\nOther's were in support of the marketing, with one declaring it to be the most 'authentic' yet.\n\nThe three-year global campaign has failed to excite the Australian audience, with many sharing their disappointment about the wordplay\n\n'Just wow.

We need to stand out from the crowd and find a unique selling point that sets us apart from our competitors.\n\n'Philausophy aims to do this by not only encouraging people to book a flight to Australia and visit our incredible destinations but go a step further and actually immerse themselves in the best of the Australian way of life.'\n\nMr Birmingham said Philausophy's core was about spotlight on the people, lifestyle and personality that make Australian experiences so memorable.\n\nImages from the campaign showcase the country's landscape and native animals; including Uluru, clear-blue beaches, kangaroos and quokkas.\n\nImages from the campaign showcase the country's landscape and native animals; including Uluru, clear-blue beaches, kangaroos and quokkas\n\nThey also include uniquely Australian slogans like 'no worries' (pictured)\n\nThey also include uniquely Australian slogans like 'no worries' and 'a stranger is mate you haven't met yet'.\n\nTourism Australia Managing Director Phillipa Harrison said the Australian character has long been focus of the marketing.\n\n'The journey perhaps began with Paul Hogan and Come Say G'Day,' she said.\n\n'In more recent times Chris Hemsworth, our global ambassador, has been integral in embodying the Australian character for our audiences.\n\n'Dundee too was all about leaning into our personality.'\n\nHemsworth was joined by conservationists and Australian icons Terri and Robert Irwin at the launch on Wednesday.\n\nOther big names in the campaign include surfer Mick Fanning, singer Kylie Minogue, comedian Adam Hills and writer Kathy Lette.", "description": "The\u00a0$38million new marketing campaign - which urges tourists around the globe to 'Come Live our Philausophy' - was unveiled on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20372322-0-image-a-17_1572437569155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
