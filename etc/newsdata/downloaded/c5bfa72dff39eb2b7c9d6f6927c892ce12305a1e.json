Getty Images\n\nFerrari have been the team to beat since the summer break, but Mercedes dominated practice here at a venue in which they are unbeaten at since 2014.\n\nThe Mercedes cars are armed with upgrades, and look well placed to extend their Japanese winning record into a sixth successive year.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, it was Bottas' name, and not Hamilton's, at the top of the time charts in both sessions.\n\nBottas spun at the final corner, but was able to recover to edge out his Mercedes team-mate.\n\nHamilton heads into Sunday's race needing to outscore Bottas by a mere five points over the next two races - here at Suzuka and in Mexico in a fortnight's time - to secure his sixth world championship.\n\nHis Mercedes team, meanwhile, can wrap up their sixth consecutive constructors' title as early as Sunday if they score 15 more points than Ferrari here. It is a scenario which looks possible after Leclerc and Vettel finished behind both Mercedes drivers, and Verstappen, too.\n\nVerstappen, cheered on by large chunks of the crowd in Suzuka, given that Red Bull are powered by Japanese manufacturer Honda, finished three tenths adrift of Bottas.\n\nThe Dutchman's team-mate Alex Albon finished sixth ahead of Carlos Sainz for McLaren. British teenager Lando Norris was 10th, three tenths slower than his Spanish team-mate.\n\nBritish rookie George Russell propped up the order for Williams.\n\nPA", "description": "Lewis Hamilton trailed Valtteri Bottas in what could prove a pivotal final practice session for the Japanese Grand Prix.
