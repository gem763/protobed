Many children will say their mother\u2019s love has the power to make everything okay, even just with a phone call or a simple hug.\n\nAnd Moshe Ndiki would most likely agree. The TV and radio personality often posts videos and pictures of his mother, sharing how much he loves and appreciates her. And from what we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve concluded she\u2019s the funnier one of the two. She doesn\u2019t disagree either.\n\nTaking to Twitter, Moshe shared a video of a conversation he had with his mother in the kitchen. In it she tells her son: \u201cThe real actor is me, but what stood in my way is that there weren\u2019t a lot of opportunities in my time. You took all my genes, that\u2019s why you\u2019re the way you are today, it\u2019s because of me. And fortunately for you, your time awarded you enough opportunities to become who you are today. But that\u2019s all because of the beast [she points to herself] that gave birth to you.\u201d\n\nBy the time she\u2019s finished, Moshe and the people in the background are dying with laughter.", "description": "Speaking to DRUM, Moshe\u2019s mom says her son was always a very naughty child.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9492/c9355f90b94e4fcca1e63ccaf24c27ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
