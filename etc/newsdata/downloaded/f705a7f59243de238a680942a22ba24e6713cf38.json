Those arrested include the group's leader, 85-year-old Charles Kormi Kudjordji.\n\nThey face charges of conspiracy to commit treason, as well as charges connected to the alleged training of a militia force.\n\n\"Members of the group are being picked up,\" a police officer said, who asked to remain anonymous as \"a joint police-military security operation\" was ongoing.\n\n\"So far we've picked up 20 members and we hope to arrest more,\" the officer said.\n\nA member of the group, Forster Agbormenya, confirmed the arrests.\n\nPolice said the men were part of a group called the \"Homeland Study Group Foundation\", or HGSF.\n\nThe group formed in 1994, and says it works to advance the rights of the people in eastern Ghana, which it calls Western Togoland.\n\nIn 2017, HGSF leaders were arrested and warned not to engage in activities against the state.\n\nMultiple ethnicities live in the region, a place with a history of rule by three colonial European powers.\n\nBritain seized much of what is today Ghana, and Germany grabbed neighbouring Togo.\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in World War One, the land was split between British Togoland and French Togoland.\n\nWhen Britain left its empire in Africa, British Togoland became part of eastern Ghana in 1956.\n\nBut separatists say the area has its own unique history and culture, and want a country of their own.", "description": "Police in Ghana have arrested at least 20 people accused of preparing to declare an eastern region as an independent country, police say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8581/92612189c269453dae3eb61756b1b929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-08"}
