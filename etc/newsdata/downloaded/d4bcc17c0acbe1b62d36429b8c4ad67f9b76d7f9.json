REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nEuropean shares cut losses and U.S. stock indexes turned higher early in the session after Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected.\n\nTrump made the remarks to reporters a day after delivering a stinging rebuke to China\u2019s trade practices at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a \u201cbad deal.\u201d\n\nStocks in Europe were pressured by political uncertainty after Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives moved to launch a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nBut Wall Street shrugged off an impeachment investigation, with the benchmark S&P 500 posting its biggest daily gain in two weeks. Yields on U.S. Treasury long-dated debt rose after falling for seven straight sessions.\n\nThe White House released a summary of a telephone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, who said he was not pushed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cAs long as the economy remains firm, we don\u2019t think the drama out of Washington will impact the staying power of this bull market,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.01%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.58% while in London, the FTSE 100 index .FTSE fell 0.02%.\n\nMichael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, said good economic data is fighting with political noise and good data is winning.\n\nSales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August, the latest sign that lower mortgage rates were starting to boost the struggling housing market.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment is not a big issue until you get into a recession. It\u2019s a big deal politically, but it\u2019s not a big deal economically,\u201d said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 162.94 points, or 0.61%, to 26,970.71. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 18.25 points, or 0.62%, to 2,984.85 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 83.76 points, or 1.05%, to 8,077.38.\n\nThe dollar benefited from a sharp pullback for the pound GBP= amid worries about nagging Brexit- and election-related risks.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.71%, with the euro EUR= down 0.69% to $1.0942. The Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.67% versus the greenback at 107.81 per dollar.\n\nMost yields on 10-year euro zone bonds yields rose in late trade following Trump\u2019s comment U.S.-China trade.\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year Bund yield rose 2 bps at -0.58% DE10YT=RR.\n\nYields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 27/32 in price to yield 1.7302%.\n\nOil prices fell for a second day as U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly surged 2.4 million barrels in the week to Sept. 20, according to the Energy Information Administration, instead of declining 249,000 barrels as analysts expected. [EIA/S]\n\nCrude prices fell after Trump said on Tuesday he saw a path to peace with Iran, easing supply fears after the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities that halved its output. The kingdom and the United States have blamed Iran for the attack.\n\nBrent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 71 cents at $62.39 a barrel.
