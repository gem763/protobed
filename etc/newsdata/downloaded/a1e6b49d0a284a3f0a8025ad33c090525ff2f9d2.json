Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOne short of equalling Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 singles Grand Slam titles, Williams will be hoping that the fourth time is the charm after three agonizing near misses since returning to action following the birth of her first child.\n\nAlready the oldest Grand Slam finalist in the Open era, Williams will celebrate her 38th birthday in three weeks while her 19-year-old Canadian opponent will not be able to celebrate a victory with a drink at New York City bar for two more years.\n\n\u201cIt is just surreal I don\u2019t know what to say it is a dream come true to play Serena in the finals of the U.S. Open,\u201d said Andreescu following her 7-6(3) 7-5 semi-final win over Swiss Belinda Bencic on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nAt the end of last year Andreescu sat an anonymous 178th in the world rankings and lost in the first round of U.S. Open qualifying.\n\nOn Saturday she will step out onto Arthur Ashe Stadium tipped by many as the heir to Williams\u2019 crown as the queen of women\u2019s tennis.\n\nJust the second Canadian woman after Eugenie Bouchard to play in a Grand Slam final, Andreescu has rarely looked out of place on the big stage.\n\nHer breakout season has seen her already win two of the WTA Tour\u2019s elite events in Indian Wells and Toronto while her run to the U.S. Open final has only confirmed her status as the next big thing.\n\nMore remarkably the 19-year-old is playing in just her fourth main draw at a Grand Slam having never before ventured beyond the second round.\n\nThe final will pit power against power with Andreescu having demonstrated she is well equipped to go toe-to-toe with the game\u2019s big hitters and few in the history of the sport have delivered more punishment from the baseline than Williams.\n\nThe two have met just once before in the final of the Rogers Cup in August but there is little to be gleaned from the encounter with Williams quitting with back spasms while down 3-1 in the opening set.\n\n\u201cShe really knows how to mix up the game and play different shots in different ways,\u201d said Williams assessing her opponent. \u201cShe\u2019s a great player.\n\n\u201cYou never know what is going to come from her.\n\n\u201cShe serves well, moves well, has a ton of power. She\u2019s very exciting to watch.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere inside Arthur Ashe Stadium on Saturday is sure to be supercharged with memories of last year\u2019s chaotic and controversial final, that saw Naomi Osaka\u2019s victory overshadowed by an explosive confrontation between chair umpire Carlos Ramos and an enraged Williams, hanging in the air.\n\nThat match saw Williams deducted a point and later a game for her behavior, which included a smashed racket and calling Ramos a \u201cliar\u201d and \u201cthief\u201d.\n\nWilliams has done her best to pretend last year\u2019s events never happened.\n\nAt her first press conference Williams said she did not know a Carlos Ramos and on Thursday, when asked if she had learned any lessons from last year, batted the question answering: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really crossed my mind\u201d.", "description": "A clash of generations will decide the U.S. Open on Saturday with Serena Williams taking a fourth crack at Grand Slam history against teenager Bianca Andreescu, who was not even born when the American lifted her first Flushing Meadows trophy.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426810856&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850KI-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
