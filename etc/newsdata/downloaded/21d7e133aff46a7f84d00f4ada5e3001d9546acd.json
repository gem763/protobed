The public, other housemates, and now even his former co-stars don't seem too convinced. Those who have been regularly watching the show will agree.\n\nTwitter\n\nHis former co-star and friend Aastha Chaudhary, too, said that the one thing he has to do in the house is learn how to control his anger.\n\n\u201c I have known Sidharth over the past 10 years. We started our careers together. But yes, (comparing) the Sidharth I know over the past 10 years and what [sic] he is now, (I can say he) is more mature and sensible. One thing about him is that he won't take any s*** from anyone. So I think he should control his anger a bit because they (the other housemates) will try to trigger him. I have heard good things about him. Everyone is saying that he is playing very well\u201d.\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 244 SHARES 1.3 K SHARES 282 SHARES 8.2 K SHARES\n\nWell, not just Aastha, even Koena Mitra, a former contestant of the house told us in an interview that while Sidharth is a strong player, he needs anger management.\n\nSidharth and Rashami Desai have indulged in big fight since last week and now the house is divided in two groups. Paras reportedly even said in the house that Sidarth was in rehab for a year.\n\nStay tuned for all the latest updates on Bigg Boss 13.", "description": "Now this advise is something that everyone is giving Sidharth Shukla right one.
