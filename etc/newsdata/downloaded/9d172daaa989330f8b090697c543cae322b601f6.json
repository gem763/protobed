Why is Nancy Pelosi doing this?\n\nBecause she has resigned herself to the argument that impeaching Trump is the way for Democrats to win the presidency and Senate 13 months from now. Pelosi\u2019s bank shot isn\u2019t aimed at Trump\u2019s conviction on the Hill. It\u2019s aimed at his loss at the polls.\n\nAmerican University professor Allan Lichtman best expressed the political logic in a recent op-ed. His \u201c13 keys\u201d model, along with most quantitative forecasts, currently favors Trump\u2019s reelection. Lichtman says impeachment would change that by tarnishing the incumbent with scandal. The facts of the case, and whether the Senate convicts, do not matter.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Continetti", "Freebeacon.Com Columns Pelosis-Impeachment-Bank-Shot"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
