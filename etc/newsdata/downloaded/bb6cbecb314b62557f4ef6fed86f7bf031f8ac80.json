You can't just get by on penalties and drop goals,\" Erasmus said.\n\nThe All Blacks have reacted by dropping prop centurion Owen Franks and relegating Ben Smith to the bench, while Rieko Ioane, once a first-choice wing, cannot even make the matchday 23.\n\nInstead, coach Steve Hansen has gone for the youthful exuberance of wings George Bridge and Sevu Reece, while devising a twin playmaker role for Beauden Barrett at fullback with Richie Mo'unga wearing 10.\n\nThey are all capable under the high ball as well as being noted counter-attackers, with Bridge and Reece the try-scoring weapons for the Super Rugby champion Canterbury Crusaders, while Barrett is a two-time world player of the year.\n\nNepo Laulala comes into the front row in a rethink about the requirement for props, with the All Blacks favouring mobility over muscle in an attempt to tire the heavyweight South African pack.\n\nRead says there is \"nothing special\" about the rapid revival of the Springboks over the past two years.\n\n\"They do it well which is being physical, kicking well... and using their strength which is their maul.\n\n\"We know what's coming our way and we're in a good place to put a plan out that we think is going to match it.\"", "description": "New Zealand captain Kieran Read said Saturday's highly anticipated clash with South Africa is one of the biggest matches of his career as the All Blacks launch their bid for a record third consecutive world crown.
