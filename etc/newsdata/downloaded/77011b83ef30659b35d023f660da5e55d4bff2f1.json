Eleven years ago, the Bogans got some, including the buttonwood.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I consider to be what we call a legacy tree,\u201d Bogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s one that\u2019s passed from one person to another.\u201d\n\nA bonsai tree is like an Old Masters painting or a historic house: You don\u2019t so much own one as care for it so it can be passed on to the next caretaker. Some bonsai are hundreds of years old, their lineage recorded as carefully as any princeling\u2019s.\n\nAD\n\nThe Bogans came to love the rough appeal of the buttonwood, named, supposedly, because Native Americans used its hard wood for buttons.\n\n\u201cIn swamps, they\u2019re constantly windblown and hurricanes tear part of the bark off. That gives it an old driftwood, gnarly-looking trunk,\u201d Bogan said.\n\nAD\n\nThis summer, the Bogans were approached by a Tennessee bonsai broker named Bjorn Bjorholm who said he had a client who was searching for a stellar tree to give as a gift.\n\nThe buttonwood fit the bill.\n\nBogan didn\u2019t know who the tree was going to until news rippled through the bonsai community that the CIA had posted a photo of a bonsai on its Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe saw it and said, \u2018That\u2019s our tree,\u2019\u201d Bogan said.\n\nAD\n\nThe tree had been given to the CIA director by the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for us to receive gifts from foreign countries,\u201d said CIA spokeswoman Chelsea Robinson. \u201cIn this particular case it was just in honor of our country\u2019s close partnership with the UAE.\u201d\n\nUnlike a ceremonial dagger or a crystal vase, the tree could not just be put on a shelf. It needed the proper environment and regular care.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had it in my office, in front of this big window,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe put out a big punch bowl filled with water, shut the door and covered up the air-conditioner vents trying to make it more humid. We were terrified of leaving the tree.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd so the decision was made to transfer it to the National Bonsai & Penjing Museum at the National Arboretum.\n\nIn a letter to the museum, CIA director Haspel wrote: \u201cWhile the CIA has many talented officers, we are not skilled in the art of bonsai maintenance, and so we are incredibly grateful that the tree will be preserved in the museum\u2019s celebrated collection and that it is in such expert hands.\u201d\n\nBill Jagoe died four or five years ago. Dave Bogan called his family with the latest developments: \u201cI told them that their father\u2019s tree was now going to be in the National Arboretum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe buttonwood is in the collection\u2019s \u201cgrowout\u201d area, recovering from its travels before it goes on display.\n\nAD\n\nThere was something I was curious about. Isn\u2019t it risky for the CIA to accept gifts destined for the director\u2019s office, even from an ally?\n\n\u201cOur security had to check the tree to be sure there was nothing in it,\u201d the CIA\u2019s Robinson said. \u201cI will say \u2014 it\u2019s pretty funny \u2014 when we were moving the tree we did discover there actually was a praying mantis in it. So, technically, we were bugged.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "A tree that came from Florida and grew in Indiana is now at the National Arboretum.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pH10lXniUqpIlCoLltsGniQVLA0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O7KHO7XEMEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
