Bolton also opposed Trump\u2019s desire to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an effort to strike a new deal that would limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program and take Washington and Tehran away from the brink of a military conflict.\n\nOn North Korea, Trump came to view Bolton as a potential spoiler for a landmark nuclear deal with the isolated country and repeatedly excluded him from important meetings. During Trump\u2019s second summit with Kim in Hanoi, Trump ordered that Bolton not be included in a dinner meeting with senior U.S. and North Korean officials. When Trump made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone in June, Trump dispatched Bolton to Mongolia instead of having him stay in the country for the Trump-Kim meeting.\n\nTrump repeatedly expressed frustration with Bolton and his aides over the issue Bolton was given the most control over: Venezuela. Bolton had told the president that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro could be quickly ousted following the U.S. imposition of economic sanctions on the country\u2019s state oil company. But China and Russia stood by the authoritarian leader\u2019s side, and the standoff has worsened the humanitarian situation, causing more severe food and medicine shortages.\n\nDays before his resignation, Bolton had argued harshly against an emerging deal with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops in exchange for a promise that the militant group would not allow the country to become a staging ground for terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump looks at John Bolton, then national security adviser, at the White House in 2018. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nBolton had annoyed Pompeo, who oversaw the negotiations with the Taliban, less for his ideology and more for his aggressive, bureaucratic management style. As a result of these tensions, Pompeo excluded Bolton\u2019s team from discussions on Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea. Officials complained that Bolton\u2019s team would lose on a specific policy, such as whether to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, and then leak a distorted view of the decision to a select group of journalists.\n\n\u201cHis team has a reputation for losing and leaking,\u201d said one senior administration official, explaining his exclusion from key decision-making. Like others, the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.\n\nAt the center of the tension between Trump and Bolton is a difference in ideology. Trump came to power promising an end to the United States\u2019 \u201cendless war,\u201d saying that the country has wasted billions of dollars on a military presence that does more to protect wealthy U.S. allies than average American citizens.\n\nBolton, by contrast, harbors a view that exalts the use of American military power and favors a forceful response to traditional American adversaries such as Russia, Iran, Venezuela and North Korea. At different times, Trump sought to test diplomatic options with each country, but Bolton aggressively resisted the moves, officials said.\n\nWhile Bolton tangled with the president and Cabinet officials behind the scenes, he kept a strong public show of support for the president. But the abrupt nature of his departure has raised questions about whether Bolton, a former Fox News pundit, will become a public critic of the president in his post-government life.\n\nThe two men already have found one thing to disagree on: whether Bolton resigned or was fired. In an effort to retake the narrative, Bolton tweeted Tuesday: \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s desire to end U.S. military conflicts exposed sharp differences with his national security adviser.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XCNhVOykXj5OREr2EbLCoGTwZJ0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M4VKAJGUAMI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
