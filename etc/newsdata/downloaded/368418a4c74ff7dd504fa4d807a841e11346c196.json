Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks while introducing health care legislation titled the \"Medicare for All Act of 2019/9ccd4696-2249-46ec-b689-c6c7511b9530/98d222d822585dc92618b420a2d1f9be\" with Sen.

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday introduced a plan to cancel $81 billion in past-due medical bills and replace private credit-reporting companies with a public registry that will exclude debt tied to health costs.\n\nThe Vermont Democrat proposed revising a 2005 bankruptcy law to let people with high bills use the courts to seek relief, and eliminate the means-testing requirement to file for protection from creditors, according to a statement from his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe very concept of medical debt should not exist,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are finding themselves nearly broke or bankrupt because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.\u201d\n\nRead more: Sanders Teases Proposal to Write Off $81 Billion in Medical Debt\n\nThe plan notes 79 million Americans \u201cstruggle to pay\u201d bills, or are paying off medical debts.\n\nUnder the proposal, the federal government would step in to negotiate and pay off past-due bills in collections reported to credit agencies. The plan also would replace for-profit credit reporting companies with a public registry that uses a computer algorithm to determine creditworthiness.\n\nThe signature proposal of Sanders\u2019s campaign is a Medicare for All system that would provide health insurance to every American, replacing private insurance with a government-run system. Health care premiums, deductibles and co-pays would end, offset by higher taxes.\n\nRead more: Sanders Defends Medicare for All Provision for Union Members\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Steve Geimann in Washington at sgeimann@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Steve Geimann\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday introduced a plan to cancel $81 billion in past-due medical bills and replace private credit-reporting companies with a public registry that will exclude debt tied to health costs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHDkLA.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=668&y=340"}
