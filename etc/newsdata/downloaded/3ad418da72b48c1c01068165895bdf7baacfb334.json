I come twice a week to pay my respects.\n\nSharon Doherty with her late husband, Harry, who passed away last year (Picture: MEN Media)\n\nSharon Doherty, 56, was taking freshly bought flowers to the grave of her late-husband (Picture: MEN)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t have put the pile on somewhere that isn\u2019t the grave. Why not next to it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The ornaments with it aren\u2019t expensive or anything, but they look like they\u2019ve just chucked them there. I feel like it\u2019s been violated, it\u2019s not right.\u2019\n\nThe grave will be clear again on Monday afternoon, but this has not made the situation any better for Sharon.\n\nHenry \u2018Harry\u2019 Doherty passed away on September 7, 2018 from lung cancer. He was 80 years old.\n\nSharon is currently in the process of organising a tombstone for him, with a memorial sign being in place until that happens.\n\nThe staff at the cemetery came with cloths to cover the mound of soil at the request of Sharon (Picture: MEN Media)\n\nOrnaments, flowers, and a sign had been moved to make way for another funeral (Picture: MEN Media)\n\nAs well as the soil, there were also tyre marks on the grave behind Harry\u2019s, which were then covered over by the cemetery staff when Sharon pointed them out.\n\nThe staff also came out with sheets to cover the soil pile at the request of Sharon, with them also apologising for the way the grave had been left.\n\nSharon added: \u2018I just felt like getting a shovel and chucking it back. They said that the machine won\u2019t reach beyond the next grave. I just feel violated and disrespected.\n\n\u2018They said usually they put notes on it, so I asked where it was and they said they hadn\u2019t done it. It\u2019ll all be gone by 2pm on Monday but that doesn\u2019t help me, does it?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter apologies from the cemetery staff and the grave site being tidied, Sharon then replaced some of the old flowers, but was still upset about the situation.\n\nA spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council , who look after the cemetery, said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry to hear this complaint about soil being left on a grave in Cleethorpes Cemetery and have spoken to the person concerned.\n\n\u2018Great care is taken when we are digging in the cemetery and we protect any neighbouring graves when working. This work is essential and graves are reinstated to their former condition after backfilling is complete.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
