If there's a loophole there we'll close it.\"\n\nThe bill has already been significantly softened from the version that was shelved before the election in order to reduce the backlash from business and ensure Parliamentary passage.\n\nThe biggest change is that the Federal Court, not the treasurer of the day, will decide whether a company should have its assets forcibly divested upon a recommendation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\nAlso, the laws will expire in 2025 and the powers will apply only to the conduct of energy companies in the wholesale market.\n\nEnergy companies are still vehemently opposed to the bill, especially a contracting provision that enables the government to compel them to supply electricity, or electricity contracts, at whatever terms and conditions the treasurer of the day sees fit. That could include the price, quantity and duration \u2013 for a period of up to three years.\n\nWith Labor coming on board, it seems highly likely the bill will pass both houses. Even without Labor's support, the Senate crossbench has indicated its in-principle support.\n\nIn its submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the laws, the Australian Energy Council says the contracting powers must also be taken away from the treasurer of the day and given to the federal court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A contracting order would require an electricity business to offer financial contracts to any party on terms, price, and volume determined unfettered by the Treasurer,'' it says.\n\n\"Further, the standards of proof required prior to making such an order are alarmingly low. The ACCC would only need to hold a \u2018belief\u2019 that the electricity business has engaged in the prohibited conduct.\n\n\"The Treasurer would then need only be \u2018satisfied\u2019 that a breach has occurred, without any judicial process or finding.\n\n\"This is a serious and ill-considered incursion into the operation of private enterprises in the Australian economy, and one premised on a process that does not afford procedural fairness.\"\n\nThe AEC says there is a real risk the power will be politicised and \"maintains that a contracting order should only be determined by the Federal Court, in line with the application of the Divestment Order power.\"", "description": "Labor's support for the big stick legislation hinges on concerns about privatisation which the government says will be addressed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.256%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_74/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/18a092c761fbdaac639fc05a73881fc0bbdc050a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
