The man knows how to stage a fake fight\u2014like his current brawl with the Fox News Channel. On Wednesday, he mounted a three-tweet attack on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s channel. He savaged it for covering the Democrats, for hiring Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, for keeping Juan Williams and Shep Smith on the payroll, and he invited its viewers to stop watching his once-favorite channel.\n\n\u201cThe New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down!\u201d the president barked. \u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis tantrum followed a similar surge of fury from Trump in March, when he denounced Fox\u2019s weekend anchors, asking whether they had been trained by CNN.\n\nHappy to play the fall guy in the match, Fox anchors pushed back on this latest iteration of Trump\u2019s bogus \u201cFox is being mean to me\u201d storyline. Three minutes after Trump\u2019s first Wednesday tweet, anchor emeritus Brit Hume charged onto Twitter to throw the president in a headlock. \u201cFox News isn\u2019t supposed to work for you,\u201d Hume wrote.\n\nThen Trump escalated the feud on Thursday in a half-hour interview with Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade on his Fox News Radio show. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with Fox,\u201d Trump griped, criticizing Fox\u2019s polls as \u201cphony.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s protest prompted Fox host Neil Cavuto to retaliate by throwing a televised flying forearm at the president\u2019s face. Cavuto reiterated Hume\u2019s point that Fox doesn\u2019t work for Trump. \u201cMy job, Mr. President, our job here is to keep the score, not settle scores,\u201d Cavuto insisted, uttering the channel\u2019s \u201cfair and balanced\u201d slogan like a mantra.\n\nHow angry at Fox can Trump genuinely be? Trump told Kilmeade that he appreciates the broadcasts of his longtime champions, the opinion triumvirate of Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, who host popular night-time shows on Fox. They\u2019re so close to Trump they\u2019re practically unpaid advisers to his presidency. Trump also gets unalloyed tenderness and obsequious respect from the Fox & Friends crew when he phones in. Lou Dobbs of Fox\u2019s sister network, Fox Business Network, does the same. Dobbs has formed a \u201cmind meld\u201d with Trump on immigration, China and more, according to a Washington Post profile. Trump returns Dobbs\u2019 love, calling the anchor \u201cThe Great Lou Dobbs.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to think everybody who appears on Fox should belong to his tag team, so when hard news anchors Shep Smith and Chris Wallace or weekend anchors Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert speak a disparaging word about his policies or ask tough questions, they\u2019re somehow betraying him. Being second-guessed by Fox\u2019s in-house liberal pundits, Brazile and Williams, also rankles him.\n\nBut given his background in wrestling, you would think he would appreciate that Fox conservatives need an opposition to easily pummel. It wouldn\u2019t be Fox if somebody isn\u2019t playing the role of Alan Colmes. Trump\u2019s flimsiest objection to Fox\u2019s coverage is his critique of the channel\u2019s decision to report on the Democrats running for president. \u201cHard to believe @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete, as Chris Wallace likes to call him,\u201d Trump tweeted in May. \u201cFox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering Dems.\u201d He can\u2019t possibly believe that Fox should cover him to the exclusion of covering the Democrats, can he?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump is once again laying the groundwork to start his own, Foxier than Fox TV channel or conservative news website\u2014annoyed to have his 2016 campaign plan interrupted by a presidency. But it\u2019s far likelier that this is all make-believe.\n\nIn the world of pro wrestling, \u201ckayfabe\u201d is the code of secrecy that demands all players stay in \u201ccharacter before, during, and after shows\u201d to maintain the illusion that a real fight is happening. Trump\u2019s trash talk and the raspberries that Fox functionaries like Hume and Cavuto blow back at him are pure kayfabe. As Media Matters for America\u2019s Matt Gertz has noted, Trump so adores Fox that he\u2019s peppered his administration with former Fox News staffers, and five of his former employees have moved on to jobs at Fox or its parent company. Just recently, former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, among the most loyal of all Trumpies, took a job as a Fox News contributor.\n\nTrump\u2019s faux-fight with Fox is designed 1) to add drama and excitement to where there is none; 2) make him the primary focus of events; and 3) temporarily complicate the storyline so viewers keep watching. Fox benefits from Trump\u2019s periodic attacks (remember when he boycotted one of Fox\u2019s 2016 presidential debates because it wouldn\u2019t dump Megyn Kelly from the broadcast). They make the channel look like it\u2019s standing up to the president, and Fox ends up looking more independent and credible.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get more kayfabe than that.\n\n******\n\nMore kayfabe? WWE executive Linda McMahon served in the Trump as the head of the Small Business Administration. More kayfabe: In 2009, Trump \u201cbought\u201d WWE\u2019s Monday Night Raw program from Vince McMahon. Send wrestling notes to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.
