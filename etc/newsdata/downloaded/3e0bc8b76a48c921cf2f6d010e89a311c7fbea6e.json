If enacted, Warren\u2019s plan would raise the average monthly Social Security benefits from $1,395 to $1,595 in 2020, according to an analysis by Moody\u2019s economist Mark Zandi.\n\nChange the way annual cost-of-living increases are calculated to use a measure of inflation that focuses on seniors and they costs they face, including health care.\n\nProvide Social Security credit to people in job-training programs and those who leave the workforce to care for family members.\n\nEnd current provisions that reduce benefits for many former state and local public employees with pensions.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan would cost $150 billion in its first year. To pay for it, she proposes raising taxes on upper-income households, including:\n\nA new 14.8% payroll tax on annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, only earnings up to $132,900 are subject to a 12.4% payroll tax. Under Warren\u2019s plan, the cap would continue to rise, reaching the $250,000 level by 2037, eliminating the gap.\n\nA 14.8% tax on investment income in wealthy households, with a threshold of $250,000 for single filers and $400,000 for married joint filers.\n\nA broader definition of investment income that is subject to payroll tax.\n\nThe application of payroll taxes to pass-through business owners.\n\nThe Warren campaign estimated that those new taxes would result in a $1.1 trillion reduction in the federal deficit over a decade, based on the analysis by Moody\u2019s Analytics. The revenue increases would help stabilize the Social Security system\u2019s finances, keeping the program\u2019s trust fund solvent until 2054, according to the analysis.\n\nWhy it matters: It\u2019s a shrewd political move to court older voters who polls show are more likely to favor Joe Biden. More importantly, perhaps, Warren\u2019s plan reinforces a major change in approach toward Social Security among Democrats in recent years. \u201cWarren\u2019s proposal is the latest sign that Democrats have shifted from promising to protect Social Security benefits \u2014 or in the case of former President Barack Obama, proposing to slow the rate at which benefits increase over time \u2014 to expanding the program and increasing benefits,\u201d Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley of The New York Times said.\n\nMoody\u2019s Zandi said that while there is considerable uncertainty around the proposal given the complexity of the issue, Warren\u2019s plan would \u201cput the system on much sounder financial ground, extending its solvency by almost 20 years into the middle of this century\u201d and create \u201ca much more progressive Social Security system\u201d that would lift nearly 5 million elderly Americans out of poverty.\n\nHowever, by asking the rich to pay much more, the plan may run the risk of weakening political support for the country\u2019s most important poverty reduction program, Zandi said.\n\nRead Warren\u2019s proposal here, along with Zandi\u2019s analysis and writeups at Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal (paywall) and The New York Times.\n\nLike what you're reading?
