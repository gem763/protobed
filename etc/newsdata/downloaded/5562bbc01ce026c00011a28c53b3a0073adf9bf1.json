Maybe one day that will happen.\n\n\u201cFor now the manager has decided I\u2019m a right back. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll play.\u201d On whether he would be open to a midfield role, he said: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m really not fussed where I play.\n\n\u201cI just want to play football. If a manager decides to use me in midfield, or as a centre-back or a striker then that\u2019s where I\u2019ll play.\n\n\u201c[I modelled myself on] Gerrard, really. Everything about his game I always admired. I always studied him and wanted to be like him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not that important to compare because at a young age, you haven\u2019t achieved the things those types of players have. It\u2019s difficult to say whether you will or won\u2019t. Who knows?\n\n\u201cFor now, it\u2019s about having an open mind and wanting to achieve those types of levels, wanting to be those types of players, wanting to reach the levels they\u2019ve reached.\n\n\u201cBeing regarded in the same bracket as them is something the best players want.\u201d", "description": "Trent Alexander-Arnold has revealed that he has modelled his career to date on Liverpool\u00a0great Steven Gerrard and that he could move into a midfield role one day.
