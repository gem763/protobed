The school has some 560 learners.\n\nThe Gates couple then visited a creche in the Site B Informal Settlement.\n\nThrough the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates has invested large amounts in South Africa. The foundation identified South Africa as one of the ten countries where it believes it can have the greatest impact.\n\nIt has invested in more than 100 South African organisations which are focused on discovering new medicines for HIV and TB, as well as treating and preventing those illnesses. Some of these organisations are also involved in agriculture, water sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nGates\u2019 visit to South Africa could coincide with his becoming the world\u2019s richest person again. Bloomberg reports that he looks set to reclaim that title from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose fortunes are closely tied to the Amazon share price. Amazon has been under pressure this week, ahead of a profit update late on Thursday.\n\nBezos has been the world\u2019s richest for the past two years, but a rally in Microsoft\u2019s share price and the Amazon founder\u2019s divorce settlement have contributed to a potential shift.\n\n\"Gates, on the other hand, may have never relinquished the top spot were it not for his philanthropy. He has donated more than $35 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation since 1994,\" Bloomberg reported.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates arrive in Khayelitsha via a mini-bus taxi.
