It was part of a plea deal\n\nBreana was a cheerleader and manager of the high school football team, which Trejo was on. She was stabbed and strangled\n\nHe was being tried as an adult because in March 2005, the US Supreme Court ruled that those under 18 cannot have capital punishment imposed upon them, and he was held without bond.\n\nTrejo's maternal aunt, Alexzaundra Patton-Manu, last year told The Daily Beast his parents and siblings were 'in complete shock' after learning of the allegations against him.\n\n'This is not him,' she told the news site. 'This is not his character.'\n\nThe aunt said that no one in the family knew anything about Trejo's relationship with Rouhselang, and that his parents were not aware that the cheerleader was expecting a baby with their son.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re a loving family. All of us go to church. We\u2019re all God-fearing people,\u2019 Patton-Manu said. \u2018We just want everybody to stop trying to harass everybody in our family. We didn\u2019t do nothing wrong.\u2019\n\nPatton-Manu characterized her nephew - the youngest of four siblings - as a private person but a normal teen who loved sports and video games.\n\nPatton-Manu raised the possibility that a concussion that Trejo allegedly suffered on the football field earlier this year may have played a role in the tragedy.\n\nAaron Trejo (in 2016) was arrested at his home in December and charged with murder and feticide\n\nBreana's family called police at about 4.30am after they 'got the feeling that something wasn't right,' authorities said\n\nAuthorities investigated the scene where Breana's body was discovered (pictured). Her body was found in a dumpster behind Pasquale Rulli Pizza\n\n'That could have messed with his mind, too,' she speculated. 'This is not him.'\n\nThe body of Rouhselang, a member of the cheer squad and football team manager at Mishawaka High School, was discovered by authorities in a dumpster behind Pasquale Rulli Pizza, just a block away from where she lived with her biological mother.\n\nHer mother last saw her alive when the teen said she was going to meet the father of her baby behind their house at 11pm. She never returned.\n\nDetective Gery Mullins detailed the conversation in charging documents in which Trejo confessed to the horrifying crimes, which occurred after the teenage pair had a fight.\n\n'I then asked Aaron if the fight was about the pregnancy,' Mullins wrote.\n\n'Aaron Trejo quietly said, \"Yes.\" Aaron then explained that Breana waited too long to tell Aaron about the pregnancy to get an abortion. I asked Aaron what he did about that, and he replied, \"I took action...I took her life.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear exactly where the dumpster holding Breana's body was located, a Google Street View picture captured in 2011 shows the location of a dumpster behind the restaurant\n\nBreana's stepmother said that she was six months pregnant when her body was found\n\n'Aaron explained that he stabbed Breana in the heart with a knife he brought from home. Aaron chose to use a knife because he thought it would kill Breana quickly.\n\n'Aaron stated that he put the black plastic bag over Breana, which he had brought from home for that purpose.\n\n'Aaron Trejo said that he had been planning and thinking about killing Breana and the baby for about a week and had not told anybody. Aaron Trejo said that after he put Breana's body in the dumpster, he walked to the river and threw Breana's phone and his knife as far out into the river as he could.'\n\nAn autopsy confirmed that Rouhselang died from multiple stab wounds and that her scarf had been tied so tightly that strangulation was occurring before she died.\n\nRouhselang's stepmother, Nicole Rouhselang, said that the last time that she had seen Rouhselang was when she attended her father Dave Rouhselang's birthday celebration on November 17.\n\nBreana told her biological mother she was going to meet the father of her baby.\n\nHer mother woke up at 1am and realized her daughter wasn't home and went to Trejo's house. Trejo told her that Rouhselang never showed up to talk and that she's lost her phone.\n\nHer family called police about 4.30am after they 'got the feeling that something wasn't right,' Arendt said.\n\nAuthorities then began searching the alley near her family home, eventually discovering her body in the dumpster behind Pasquale Rulli's restaurant.\n\nBreana (right) pictured with her father, Dave, and stepmother Nicole Rouhselang (center)\n\nBreana and her father, Dave, are seen in this photo taken the last time they saw each other on November 17\n\nAuthorities said that the restaurant itself was not involved in the homicide, but that it was just 'a location of opportunity to hide the victim,' according to the South Bend Tribune.\n\nAuthorities executed a search warrant at Trejo's home morning and arrested him there.\n\nSuperintendent for School City of Mishawaka, Dean Speicher, told the South Bend Tribune that Breana and Trejo had been attending school together since they were students at John Young Middle School.\n\nThe two teens, who lived near each other, were Facebook friends, but Trejo listed himself as 'single' and Breana did not have her relationship status posted.\n\nNicole told reporters that Breana had aspirations of going to college, but that she had been receiving failing grades recently.\n\n'She was like my daughter,' Nicole told reporters, according to the South Bend Tribune. 'I've known her since she was 6. I just don\u2019t understand it. She was young\u2026 too young to have a baby herself.'\n\nBreana's classmate, Alexis Humphries, told ABC57 that she doesn't 'understand how somebody could do that like, she was just such an amazing person \u2013 her friends, family, she definitely did not deserve this.'", "description": "The 16-year-old Indiana teen charged with stabbing to death a pregnant cheerleader because she was too far along to get an abortion has pleaded guilty to her murder and feticide.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20397954-0-image-a-8_1572471740328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
