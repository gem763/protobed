A two-week preparation is the only chance we've got,' Jones said.\n\n'It's a wonderful World Cup but you can't help typhoons. We all like to think we have power but these things happen and we rise above it.\n\n'We'll do some light training Friday, have a hit out Saturday and then have a few beers.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is being put on par with a category 5 hurricane with 160mph winds expected\n\nEngland had been put through their paces on Wednesday morning with a training session\n\n'We're not concerned, we're excited. Someone is smiling at us, the typhoon gods maybe.'\n\nOthers, though, fear England could be undercooked by the time they face Australia, having not really been tested by any opponent at the World Cup.\n\nWriting in his column for Sportsmail, former England coach Sir Clive Woodward noted: 'My other thought with an England hat on is that this will mean two full weeks off between their last game against Argentina and the quarter-final against, probably, Australia.\n\n'That is a long time between big matches and Eddie Jones will have to step up the intensity in training.'\n\nSir Clive Woodward (right, with Jones over the summer) says training needs to intensify\n\nOn Twitter, fans spoke about their concerns, with one writing: 'Well rested sure, but also potentially under prepared having missed a game against a tough opponent. England haven't really been tested yet and a cancellation potentially means they're not prepared for a big game against Oz.'\n\nAnother added: 'I think England needed the step-up in intensity that the France game would have brought. I fear they will now be undercooked come Australia.'\n\nSome, though, went the other way and believed the break would be an advantage to England, who have more rest time than Australia - who are set to play against Georgia on Friday.\n\nOne fan said: 'So England v France cancelled. That's an advantage for England (and France). Not having this nonsense they need to be playing, they play too much rugby. Rest and prep.'", "description": "Eddie Jones sees England's 14-day break between matches at the Rugby World Cup as a positive, but do his side risk being under-prepared by the time they walk out for their quarter-final?", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/08/19527138-0-image-a-10_1570691153345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
