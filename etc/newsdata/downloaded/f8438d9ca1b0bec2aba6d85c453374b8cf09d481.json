At the time the regulator said it would seek to order Broadcom to halt its behaviour while the investigation proceeds \u2014 \u201cto avoid any risk of serious and irreparable harm to competition\u201d.\n\nToday Broadcom has been ordered to unilaterally stop applying \u201canticompetitive provisions\u201d in agreements with six customers, and to inform them it will no longer apply such measures.\n\nIt is also barred from agreeing provisions with the same or similar effect, and from taking any retaliatory practices intended to punish customers with an equivalent effect.\n\nCommenting in a statement, antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, said: \u201cWe have strong indications that Broadcom, the world\u2019s leading supplier of chipsets used for TV set-top boxes and modems, is engaging in anticompetitive practices. Broadcom\u2019s behaviour is likely, in the absence of intervention, to create serious and irreversible harm to competition. We cannot let this happen, or else European customers and consumers would face higher prices and less choice and innovation. We therefore ordered Broadcom to immediately stop its conduct.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Broadcom for comment.\n\nThe chipmaker has 30 days to comply with the interim measures, though it can choose to challenge the order in court.\n\nShould the order stand it will apply for up to three years \u2014 or the date of adoption of a final competition decision on the case (whichever is earlier).\n\nThe Commission began investigations into Broadcom a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe have reached the conclusion that in first sight \u2014 or in legal lingo, prima facie \u2014 Broadcom is currently infringing competition rules by abusing its dominant position in the system on a chip market in TV set-top boxes, fiber modems and xDSL modems,\u201d said Vestager today, speaking during a press conference setting out the interim measures decision.\n\nIn June, when the Commission issued formal objections, it said it believes the chipmaker holds a dominant position in markets for the supply of systems-on-a-chip for TV set-top boxes and modems \u2014 identifying clauses in agreements with manufacturers that it suspected could harm competition.\n\nAt the time it flagged seven agreements. That\u2019s now been reduced to six as the scope of the investigation has been limited to three markets, following submissions from Broadcom after the Statement of Objections.\n\nVestager said the slight reduction in scope is \u201ca reflection of a process having heard Broadcom\u2019s arguments\u201d over the past few months.\n\nThe use of interim measures is noteworthy \u2014 as a sign of how the EU regulator is seeking to evolve competition enforcement to keep up with market activity. It\u2019s the first time in 18 years the commission has sought to use the tool.\n\n\u201cInterim measures are one way to tackle the challenge of enforcing our competition rules in a fast and effective manner,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cThis is why they are important. And especially that in fast moving markets. Whenever necessary I\u2019m therefore committed to making the best possible use of this important tool.\u201d\n\nDuring a recent hearing in front of the EU parliament \u2014 as the commissioner heads towards another five years as Europe\u2019s competition chief combined with an expanded role as an EVP setting digital policy \u2014 she suggested she will seek to make greater use of interim orders as an enforcement tool.\n\nAsked today whether she has already identified other cases where interim measures could be applied, she said she hasn\u2019t but added: \u201cThe tool is on the table. And if we find cases that live up to the two things that have to be fulfilled at the same time, yes we will indeed use interim measures more often.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a line up of cases [where interim measures might be applied],\u201d she added. \u201cTwo quite substantial conditions will have to be met. One we have to prove that it\u2019s likely there will be serious and irreparable harm to competition, and second we\u2019ll have to find that there is an infringement at first sight.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] an instrument, a tool, where we still will have to be careful and precise,\u201d she went on, noting that the Broadcom investigation has taken a full year\u2019s investigation work up to this point. \u201cWe are careful and we will not compromise on the right for the company in question to defend themself.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question about whether interim measures might be more difficult to apply in digital vs traditional markets, she said the regulator will need to be able to identify harm.\n\n\u201cThe thing is for an interim measures case to work obviously you will have to be able to identify the harm. And that of course when markets are fast moving \u2014 that is the first sort of port of call. Can we identify harm in this market?\u201d she said. \u201cBut\u2026 we do a lot of different things to fully grasp how competition works in fast moving, platform-driven, network-driven markets in order to be able to do that. And to be able to use the instrument if we find a case where this would be the thing to do in order to prevent irreparable and serious harm to competition.\u201d", "description": "Europe has ordered chipmaker Broadcom to stop applying exclusivity clauses in agreements with six of its major customers \u2014 imposing so called \u2018interim measures\u2019 based on preliminary findings from an ongoing antitrust investigation.
