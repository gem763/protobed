Each team will have a men\u2019s side and a women\u2019s side, consisting of 15 players each.\n\nMatches will see each team bat for 100 balls, with the side securing the most runs emerging victorious.\n\nThe 100 balls can be bowled in sets of five or 10, and bowlers can switch ends halfway through a 10-ball spell if they wish. No bowler can deliver more than 20 balls, and each team is allowed a 150-second tactical timeout while fielding.\n\nThere will also be a batting \u2018power play\u2019 for the first 25 balls, during which only two fielders will be allowed outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nTeams will generally play each other once, but will take on their paired \u2018rivals\u2019 twice \u2013 once at home and once away.\n\nThere will be 32 league matches overall, with the top three finishers partaking in the Finals Day. The first-placed team will automatically reach the final, while second play third for the other spot in the final.\n\nThe paired rivals are: the Northern Superchargers and the Manchester Originals, London Spirit and the Oval Invincibles, Birmingham Phoenix and the Trent Rockets, and Southern Brave and Welsh Fire.\n\nWhen does it take place?\n\nThe competition will be played between 17th July and 16th August 2020.\n\nWhen is the main draft?\n\nThe remaining places in the 15-person squads will be filled on 20th October in a full draft.\n\nA draw has already determined the order in which each team will get to pick their players, with the Trent Rockets first up.\n\nWhere can I watch the draft?\n\nIt will be live streamed on the BBC Sport website at 7pm (BST).\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThere are seven salary bands, with up to two players to be picked at each band (\u00a3125,000, \u00a3100,000, \u00a375,000, \u00a360,000, \u00a350,000, \u00a340,000 and \u00a330,000 are the men\u2019s bands, with captains receiving a \u00a310,000 bonus).\n\nPlayers can select a minimum salary band at which they are willing to play, but they will not be selected during the main draft if their reserve price is not met.\n\nTeams can pick a maximum of three overseas players. The biggest names in world cricket \u2013 excluding current India internationals \u2013 are expected to make themselves available.\n\nAfter the main draft, each team will have the chance of a \u2018wildcard\u2019 pick, to be chosen during the T20 Blast next year, and that player will receive a \u00a330,000 contract.\n\nThe second stage of the selection process concerns the women\u2019s game and will take place between 1st October 2019 and 30th May 2020.\n\nTwo women have already been picked by each team, and the remaining 13 spaces in the squads will be filled from three different player pools: the remaining England centrally contracted players, overseas players and domestic players.\n\nTeams can sign one further England centrally contracted player during stage two and can sign a maximum of three overseas players.\n\nThe women\u2019s salary brackets are \u00a315,000, \u00a312,000, \u00a39,000, \u00a37,200, \u00a36,000, \u00a34,800 and \u00a33,600, with captains will receiving a \u00a31,200 bonus.", "description": "On\u00a0Thursday 10th October,\u00a040 men and women were drafted by the eight new teams that will take part in next summer\u2019s inaugural \u2018The Hundred\u2019 cricket competition.
