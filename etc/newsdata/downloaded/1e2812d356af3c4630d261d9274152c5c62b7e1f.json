This rang in the era of bootleg liquor when people whispered passwords through speak-easy doors, flappers ruled the dance floor and mobsters like Al Capone made millions from a thirsty public.

This reversed a 760-year-old declaration made by Pope Innocent III.\n\nIn 1965, workers installed the final piece of St. Louis\u2019 Gateway Arch, a 10-ton keystone.\n\nIn 1985, the leader of the so-called Walker family spy ring, John A. Walker Jr., pleaded guilty to giving U.S. Navy secrets to the Soviet Union. Walker died in a federal prison in August 2014.\n\nIn 1989, the Oakland A\u2019s wrapped up an earthquake-delayed sweep of the World Series over the San Francisco Giants.\n\nIn 2007, Cristina Fernandez became the first woman to be elected president of Argentina.\n\nIn 2010, China announced it had built what experts said was the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, capable of a sustained performance 40 percent greater than the previous record holder built in Oak Ridge, Tenn.\n\nIn 2018, the Boston Red Sox beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 in Game 5 to win their second World Series in five years. It was the seventh title in the team\u2019s history.\n\nA thought for the day: \u201cIt may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital that it should do the sick no harm.\u201d \u2014 English health reformer Florence Nightingale", "description": "Today is Monday, Oct. 28, the 301st day of 2019 with 64 to follow.
