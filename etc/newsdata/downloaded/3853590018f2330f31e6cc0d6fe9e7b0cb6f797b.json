I would have done something to disrupt the courtship,' writes Simon.\n\nShe then reveals what she did know about Onassis prior to meeting Jackie, including 'his secret oil fields, his smashing of plates around other wives and lovers' and the 'unsubstantiated rumors that he'd had Bobby Kennedy killed.'\n\nJackie did not often speak about her second husband, said Simon, but when she did detailed an emotionally abusive union between the pair.\n\nThe former first lady even said that he began to flaunt his affair with opera singer Maria Callas by dousing himself with cologne before he went to see her - despite the fact that he was flying six hours to rendezvous with his longtime paramour.\n\nAri Maria: Aristotle Onassis began to flaunt his affair with opera singer Maria Callas by dousing himself with cologne before jetting off to see her\n\nThe relationship started off well Jackie once told Carly, who recalled that conversation in her book.\n\n'He saw himself as Odysseus and I was no one to argue,' explained Jackie.\n\n'I was so in need of the kind of protection he was offering. I wanted it for Caroline and John.'\n\nShe went on to state: 'That's what a woman innately knows - she has to protect her children in any and every way, no matter how far away from your innate self you have to go.'\n\nJackie then closed out by telling her friend she 'fell for the wide net' that Onassis had cast.\n\nThings soured however when Onassis grew tired of his bride and once again found himself in the arms of Callas.\n\nOnassis told his wife that he had to travel to England see the shipyards, but she knew from the smell of his cologne that this was not the case.\n\nAnd he applied that cologne before even getting on the plane.\n\n'If she was going to meet him at the airport, I mean, he could've reapplied it,' opined Jackie at one point.\n\n'I think he wanted me to know I wasn't everything to him.'\n\nShe continued: 'He didn't want to leave me completely - not entirely in case I turned into the ideal mate he hoped he'd married.'", "description": "Carly Simon writes about the short-lived and tumultuous marriage of her friend Jackie Kennedy and second husband Aristotle Onassis in her new memoir, Touched By the Sun.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/18/20094366-0-image-a-7_1571852768859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
