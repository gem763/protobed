A finals game will certainly bring you a little bit more nerves, a little bit more pressure.\"\n\nHowever, Read said the two defeats -- Ireland's 40-29 triumph in Chicago in 2016 and their 16-9 victory in Dublin, either side of the All Blacks' 21-9 win in the Irish capital -- would count for nothing come Saturday.\n\n\"We certainly respect what the Irish team has done over those couple of games but it's a totally different ball game heading into this one,\" he said. \"It's two teams ranked very highly, good sides, and it's about turning up on the day. We take lessons from those games and we need to be a lot better than what we were.\"\n\nCross-code star Sonny Bill Williams will start on the bench and fellow center Ryan Crotty misses out altogether as coach Steve Hansen named in-form Anton Lienert-Brown and Jack Goodhue in midfield. Two-time World Rugby player of the year Beauden Barrett starts at fullback.\n\n\"Ireland are in a situation where they haven't gone past the quarterfinal. They know what it's like to go home so they'll try their darndest not to and we'll be the same,\" said Hansen.\n\nSchmidt admitted that Hansen and his backroom staff were \"good guys to have a drink with afterwards\", but stressed there would be little conviviality in the lead-up to what he said would be a challenging game for the Irish.\n\n\"We're certainly not going to sneak up on them anymore, we're not going to surprise them. They are well aware of how we play and what they are going to do to combat that,\" said the Kiwi who, like Hansen, will step down after the World Cup.\n\n\"I've no doubt they've got a few things cooked up that we haven't seen before that we're going to find really challenging.\"\n\nSchmidt drafted in Robbie Henshaw to replace Bundee Aki, banned for three matches for a high tackle in their final pool game against Samoa, at inside centre.\n\nVeteran Rory Best will skipper the team from hooker, with the experienced duo of Conor Murray and World Player of the Year Johnny Sexton named at half-back.\n\n\"We're in a reasonably good spot,\" said Best. \"Ultimately, it's all about Saturday -- it's all about which team can turn up and implement their game plan best and deal with the pressure of knockout rugby.\"\n\nHansen echoed Best's words, saying he had primed his All Blacks team to be \"excited, full of energy and ready to rumble\" as they seek a third consecutive title.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Defending world champions New Zealand are ready to conquer their quarterfinal nerves and seize the slightest opportunity when they take on Ireland on Saturday, a side that has beaten them twice in their last three meetings.
