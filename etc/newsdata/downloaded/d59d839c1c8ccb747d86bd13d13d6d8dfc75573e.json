Liam doesn't say on the podcast that they split up in January or at the time of release of For You.\"\n\nThey continued: \"That is The Sun's wrong interpretation of this quote. The couple 11 per cent split up in July 2018 as was well documented. This is just an agenda driven story once again.\"\n\nThe Sun had reported Liam as saying: \"We broke up around For You, actually, which is quite interesting. I think we kind of rubbed off on each other a bit in that way.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"In a bad way, actually. All of that stuff puts so much pressure on a relationship. For her, if you were going out somewhere, it would take so long to get out the door because you're just so worried.\"\n\nThey first struck up a romance early in 2016, and in March 2017 they welcomed baby Bear together.\n\nThe pair were well acquainted before that, though, meeting for the first time during Liam's solo auditon on the X Factor , when he was still a teenager.\n\nSince their split, they seem to have remained civil, and are co-parenting Bear with respect for each other.\n\nLiam even gushed over Cheryl's parenting skills in a Mother's Day Instagram post.\n\nThe heart throb wrote: \"Happy Mother's Day to these two amazing supermums, not sure what me and the little man would do without you.\"", "description": "Liam hit the town with new girlfriend Maya Henry as his ex Cheryl slams rumours that she and Liam faked their relationship for months", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Liampayne Instagram", "Filmmagic", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587853.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_The-BRIT-Awards-2018-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
