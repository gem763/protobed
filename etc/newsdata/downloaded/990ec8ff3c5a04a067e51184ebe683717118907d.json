It happened on September 22, too, when Aston Villa visited.\n\nVilla were leading 2-1 at the time and Xhaka was substituted to a chorus of boos.\n\nArsenal, despite being down to 10 men, went on to win 3-2 without the midfielder.\n\nUnai Emery is to blame for the fury being aimed at Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka\n\nThen five days later, Unai Emery named Xhaka as captain anyway.\n\nEmery is as much to blame as anyone. If you let the players pick their skipper, then it becomes a popularity contest and that is not what leadership is about.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a manager who decided the captaincy that way and, for me, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still the safer bet.", "description": "MARTIN KEOWN: Sunday was not the first time Granit Xhaka has been jeered by his own fans.
