A father was on a roof with his two small kids, and as the water rose an alligator came and took one of those kids right in front of him; some people were just gone. It was a few weeks before I even spoke to my parents. It was a very bad time, a time when people pulled together. We know people who lost their homes, and when we came back, everything you ever knew was misplaced, or just gone.\n\n\"My mom and grandma broke down when we went back and saw their houses. But what I went through was nothing compared to what others went through. They went through hell.\"\n\nPrograis, known as 'Rougerou' - The Bogeyman - has been living in a bedsit in Loughton, Essex, for three weeks. \"Everything\u2019s cool. The weather has been messed up, but it\u2019s okay. I came early to get adjusted to everything. The weather, the food, the time difference - everything,\u201d he explained.\n\nYou sense that nothing fazes him in the ring, after his teenage trauma, not least facing a 'home' fighter in Taylor, who has said he will give Prograis \"trouble in every department\".\n\n\u201cOf course, he\u2019s just saying that,\" said Prograis. \"He doesn\u2019t believe anything he says. Maybe he\u2019s saying that to give himself confidence. He can beat me in every department? Look at my resume, I\u2019ve fought all kinds and stopped every one of them. How can he give me trouble? Maybe he says that to convince himself, or maybe he really does believe that.\u201d\n\nPrograis returns to thoughts of New Orleans, where he holds mythical status as a fighter. \u201cEvery time I fight, my city is with me. I\u2019m like a role model. You can\u2019t say New Orleans boxing without my name. I might even be Louisiana boxing. I take my people into my fights. They ride with their people no matter what. It\u2019s like I fight for my city.\u201d\n\nJosh Taylor vs Regis Prograis for the WBA, IBF, Ring Magazine and Ali Trophy super lightweight titles is live on Sky Box Office on Saturday night.", "description": "When Regis Prograis was told by his grandmother, Carol, that it was time to make a swift exit with Hurricane Katrina one day away from wreaking havoc on his home city, the 16 year-old listened intently.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213209591-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLiZnSJs8x6dOfuqFtiWqEep4cRZuxMpyYGnF7irgIS4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
