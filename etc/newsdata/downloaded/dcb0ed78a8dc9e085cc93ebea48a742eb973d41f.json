The professor highlights a 2015 Under Armour commercial which depicts thousands of Tom Bradys working out and tells the audience to \u201cRule Yourself.\u201d Kusz says the commercial \u201cwould not seem out of place in Leni Reifenstahl\u2019s infamous Nazi propaganda film, \u2018Triumph des willens.\u2019\u201d\n\nKusz told Campus Reform it was the specific commercial from 2015 which drove him to analyze Brady further.\n\nMIAMI DOLPHINS' RAEKWON MCMILLAN SAYS REF TOLD HIM TO 'STAY OFF TOM' BRADY DURING PATRIOTS GAME\n\n\u201cI decided to research Trump and Brady's public performances of their white masculinities and how they connect with broader debates about race and gender politics after a student in one of my classes brought the Under Armour commercial to my attention and it piqued my interest,\u201d he said.\n\nKusz also hammers home the point of who Brady surrounds himself with outside football, specifically with who he takes to the Kentucky Derby with each year. He told the website that because he brings mostly white teammates with him to the event it \u201ctells a more particular story about the racial company he chooses to keep.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt is a vision of Brady as a wealthy, white man who unapologetically enjoys, and has even made a habit out of, spending time with other wealthy white men who treasure time \u2018with the boys\u2019 over all others,\u201d he said. Going to the Derby, Kusz added, \u201csuggests his performance of white masculinity shares much in common with President Trump\u2019s\u201d because most of the Derby\u2019s attendees include elite white people.\n\nThe professor, a New York native who received a doctorate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also cites Brady\u2019s failure to denounce Trump and his intense diet as evidence of how his \"white masculinity is repeatedly constructed.\"\n\nCLICK FOR MORE FROM CAMPUS REFORM", "description": "The real reason why Tom Brady is popular is because, you guessed it, white supremacy.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
