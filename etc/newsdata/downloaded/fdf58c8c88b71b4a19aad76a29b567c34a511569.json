From murderous Wimbledon fans to disrupted fairies and indistinct dinosaurs, here Etan Smallman looks at some of the finest . . .\n\nThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in a carriage from Buckingham Palace during the annual Trooping the Colour Ceremony in London 2014\n\nWE BRITISH \u2018ARE GOOD AT KILLING\u2019\n\nBBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker stressed to viewers that he was not crediting Britons\u2019 talent for murder at Wimbledon in 2017. He quickly took to Twitter to clarify that although the caption said: \u2018We are so good at killing\u2019 \u2014 he actually said \u2018queuing\u2019.\n\nBlushing bride: A unfortunate boob at Princess Eugenie's wedding where the subtitle said: 'What beautiful breasts'\n\nRUSSIAN HARDMAN IS \u2018SO GAY LOVER OF\u2019\n\nChannel 4 News\u2019s Matt Frei was discussing the Russian diplomat Sergei Lavrov. Unfortunately, Vladimir Putin\u2019s confidant \u2014 who has strongly supported his country\u2019s ban on homosexual rights to \u2018protect Russian morals\u2019 \u2014 was put on the screen as \u2018so gay lover of\u2019.\n\nAND NOW IT IS TIME FOR \u2018CAR SAUSAGE\u2019\n\nCAR SOS presenter Tim Shaw introducing his show would have been surprised to learn from the caption that he was working for a show about old bangers.\n\n\u2018THERE WILL BE SEVERE DISRUPTION TO FAIRIES\u2019\n\nTHE sense of BBC Breakfast\u2019s weather presenter Carol Kirkwood\u2019s gale warning was rather lost in translation. She was predicting disruption to . . . ferries.\n\nBBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood's gale warning was lost in translation to 'there will be severe disruption to fairies' instead of 'ferries'\n\nALL HAIL THE CHIEF, IT\u2019S \u2018PRESIDENT CHUMP'\n\nSky News might have been in trouble with the regulator over impartiality when one reporter\u2019s reference to Donald Trump was misinterpreted by the computer.\n\nYES, I AM FROM \u2018HOODEZFIELD\u2019\n\nRegional accents can often be tricky. So pity the poor American subtitler working on The Late Show during an interview with Doctor Who actress Jodie Whittaker. She explained that she was \u2018from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire\u2019. Must be her accent.\n\nIrish singer-songwriter Ryan O'Shaughnessy at the Eurovision song content singing 'Together'\n\nLOSING BUT WE WENT ON \u2018TO EAT OUR OPPONENTS\u2019\n\n\u2018Some people think football is a matter of life and death.

That turned into: \u2018An ordering counsel was made that Parliament be Pro Road.\u2019 We wouldn\u2019t want an anti-road Parliament. Elsewhere, \u2018proroguing\u2019 was transcribed as \u2018Poirot being\u2019, while \u2018justiciable\u2019 [subject to trial in a court of law] became \u2018just disabled\u2019.\n\nLady Hale was telling the Supreme Court about Parliament 'making laws' which was in subtitles as 'making love'\n\nCHINESE \u2018YEAR OF THE WHORES\u2019\n\nUSHERING in the Chinese Year of the Horse in 2014, the BBC\u2019s Tina Daheley had people around the globe celebrating something completely different.\n\n\u2018EXPECT HEAT AND NUDITY\u2019\n\nWhen they are forecasting thunderstorms on the way we are not surprised to be told that \u2018heat and humidity\u2019 are expected. But the BBC made it much more exciting.\n\n\u2018THEY RESPECT SNOWBOARDERS\u2019\n\nTheresa May\u2019s warnings about Russia were rather undermined by how they were reported on screen.

Somehow, \u2018Harry and his brother\u2019 became mangled and gave the royal seal of approval to the Lebanese terror group the Labour leader once called his \u2018friends\u2019.\n\nIn 2017 Jeremy Corbyn sent his congratulations to newly engaged Prince Harry and Meghan Markle which became mangled and gave the royal seal of approval to the Lebanese terror group\n\n\u2018ABORTION FRUIT\u2019 \u2014 EAT SEVEN A DAY\n\nEnough to put you off your dinner. \u2018A portion of fruit\u2019 became rather less appetising as the BBC reported we should be eating seven portions a day.\n\n'A portion of fruit' became a rather less appetising 'abortion fruit' according to subtitles on a BBC report\n\nVATICAN\u2019S \u2018ILLEGAL PAPAL RUMINATION\u2019\n\nCarrie Gracie quit as BBC China editor in a dispute over salaries. Railing against what she called \u2018unlawful pay discrimination\u2019 it came out wrong on screen.\n\nAND FINALLY, \u2018TIK . . . TAK . . . TIK . . . TAK . . . TIK . . .
