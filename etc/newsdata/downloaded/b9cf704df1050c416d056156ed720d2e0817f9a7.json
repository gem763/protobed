(Anthony Souffle/Star Tribune/AP)\n\nA Minnesota man appears to have live-streamed the final moments of his life Saturday night before a confrontation with police that left him dead.\n\nA video posted to the Facebook page of Brian Quinones, 30, shows the man listening to music and driving calmly outside Minneapolis just after 10 p.m. The blue and red lights of police cruisers flash in his rear window.\n\nEventually Quinones stops the car, climbs from the driver\u2019s seat and disappears from view.\n\nMoments later, the voices of police can be heard over the blaring music. Next came gunfire, a spray of bullets in two bursts \u2014 about 10 shots.\n\nThe Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office is investigating the shooting, which involved officers from police departments in the neighboring towns of Edina and Richfield outside Minneapolis. In separate statements, the agencies offered limited information about what had happened, but said that Quinones had \u201cconfronted officers with a knife.\u201d\n\nA \u201cpolice pursuit\u201d through Edina and Richfield \u201cended in an officer-involved shooting,\u201d one statement said. No officers were injured, officials said, but they did not disclose how many officers were involved or their names.\n\nThe Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the agency investigating the shooting, declined to answer questions from The Washington Post, including how many officers discharged their weapons and how many rounds were fired.\n\nThe county medical examiner\u2019s office identified Quinones as the victim and said he died from \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe loss of life in any shooting is a tragedy,\u201d the city of Richfield said in a statement.\n\nRichfield and Edina officials offered condolences to Quinones\u2019s family.\n\nAt about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, Edina police told dispatch a man had run a red light and would not pull over his vehicle, authorities told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Officers continued to follow Quinones into Richfield, where he allegedly drove through more red lights, according to emergency dispatch audio reviewed by the Star Tribune.\n\nThe shooting takes place 12 minutes into Quinones\u2019s apparent live stream.\n\nThe Star Tribune reported that Quinones\u2019s phone continued to record for another 97 minutes after the shooting. As people gathered at the scene in the rain, family members huddled and cried, and the crowd criticized police for firing their weapons, according to the newspaper.\n\n\n\nA person take pictures with a cellphone at the scene of an officer-involved shooting in Richfield, Minn., on Sept. 7.
