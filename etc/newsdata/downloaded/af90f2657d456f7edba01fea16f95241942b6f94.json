An attack on Iranian territory would be met with a \u201crapid and crushing\u201d response,\u201d the Fars News Agency said.\n\nFive days after the strikes on Saudi oil facilities, which were claimed by a Yemeni rebel group, U.S. and Saudi officials all but explicitly accused Iran of launching the attacks from its territory. They presented physical evidence and other details that they said bolstered their assertions of direct Iranian culpability.\n\nThe heightened tensions come after several months of escalating threats in the Persian Gulf, as Iran has sought to intensify pressure on the United States and its allies in response, officials in Tehran say, to the increasingly severe American sanctions crippling the Iran economy.\n\nThe initial claim of responsibility for the weekend attacks by the Iranian-allied rebels, known as the Houthis, \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the fingerprints of the ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply,\u201d Pompeo told reporters, in an apparent reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, while traveling to Saudi Arabia. His comments set the tone for a day of developments that raised temperatures across the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe attacks on the installations in eastern Saudi Arabia temporarily cut the kingdom\u2019s oil production in half and caused prices to jump worldwide.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to fly out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Sept. 17, 2019, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. (Mandel Ngan/Pool/Reuters)\n\nThe U.S. and Saudi governments have yet to provide solid evidence of where the attacks originated. In the absence of such proof, Iran has forcefully pushed back against the accusations and warned of consequences if it is attacked.\n\nThe day\u2019s first salvo came from President Trump, who wrote in a tweet that he had \u201cjust instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!\u201d He later told reporters traveling with him in California that \u201cvery significant\u201d sanctions would be announced \u201cover the next 48 hours.\u201d\n\nTrump warned of \u201ca very powerful attack\u201d against Iran Wednesday afternoon as he toured the U.S.-Mexico border in Otay Mesa, Calif., near San Diego. He said his plans are \u201cvery fluid\u201d and that \u201ca lot of things can happen \u2014 rough things and not so rough things.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters he was being judicious in evaluating whether to respond with military force. \u201cWe are doing it the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it the smart way... We will see what we will see.\u201d\n\nBut, the president added, \u201cOne call and we can go in.\u201d\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who asserted responsibility for the attacks, have since 2015 been battling a Saudi-led coalition that backs the internationally recognized government in Yemen. The conflict has caused the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly attacked the kingdom, using ground troops, drones and ballistic missiles, some reaching deep into Saudi territory. They have called the strikes a response to the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s years-long air war over Yemen, which has included thousands of airstrikes that have killed thousands of civilians, according to human rights groups.\n\nU.S. officials, however, have cast doubt on the rebels\u2019 involvement in Saturday\u2019s attacks.\n\n[Trump once ordered attack on Iran, but called it off with minutes to spare]\n\nPompeo, who met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday evening, told reporters shortly before arriving in Saudi Arabia that the intelligence community had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the weapons systems used in the attacks were not in the Houthis\u2019 arsenal. The attacks had also not come from the south, where the Houthis control territory, he added, citing \u201cflight patterns\u201d that would have explained the location of impact points at the Saudi oil facilities.\n\n\u201cThis was an Iranian attack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come from the Houthis.\u201d The United States also did not have any evidence the attacks came from Iraq, he added, but he did not specify which country had been the launchpad.\n\nA senior administration official familiar with Pompeo\u2019s visit said the U.S. team examined photos and debris, including some intact weaponry.\n\n\u201cThat equipment is not used in the Houthi arsenal, including UAVs and the light cruise missiles used,\u201d the official said.\n\nA Saudi military spokesman in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, also presented what he said was evidence of Iran\u2019s fingerprints on the strikes, including remnants of drone and cruise missiles that he said were used in the attacks and were Iranian-made.\n\nThe spokesman, Col. Turki al-Malki, said in a news conference that 18 unmanned aerial vehicles had attacked an oil processing plant in Abqaiq in eastern Saudi Arabia. Seven cruise missiles, he added, were fired at a facility in Khurais, the site of one of the kingdom\u2019s largest oil fields. Three of the cruise missiles fell short, he said.\n\nThe attacks were \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran\u201d and had not originated in Yemen, Malki said, basing the assertion in part on the purported range of the weapons recovered, which he said could not have traveled from Houthi-held territory. But Saudi officials had not determined from where the weapons were launched.\n\nMalki did not say how the launch site would be identified but said there would be \u201c accountability\u201d when it was.\n\nIran delivered its warning to the United States via the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which handles U.S. affairs in Iran. The official message condemned remarks by Pompeo and other officials linking Iran to the attacks.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s response will be prompt and strong, and it may include broader areas than the source of attacks,\u201d the Mehr News Agency reported the official note as saying.\n\nIran\u2019s Fars News Agency said any response to an attack would target \u201cmore extensive areas than the origin of the attack.\u201d There have long been fears that Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and elsewhere might attack U.S. forces in the region.\n\n[Saudi Arabia says oil output will return to pre-attack levels in weeks]\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment on Trump\u2019s tweet but repeated an assertion that \u201cthe U.S. economic terrorism is illegal,\u201d a spokesman said. Iran considers U.S. sanctions to violate the U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal, which was signed between Iran and world powers, including the United States but which the United States has disavowed under Trump.\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers U.S. sanctions, already lists 674 Iranian entities, vessels and individuals who have been sanctioned. The list includes banks, pension funds, tanker and shipping companies, cement plants, aircraft, the national oil company, judges and even a prison. The most prominent targets are the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.\n\nThough a number of potential targets are always kept in reserve, some experts wondered what remains to be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cIf there really was much more they could sanction that would have a significant impact, I don\u2019t see why they would not have done it already,\u201d said Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States still has not issued visas for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his delegation to go to New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly, and the Iranians may cancel their trip, state media reported Wednesday.\n\nPompeo declined to discuss visas for Rouhani and Zarif, whom the United States sanctioned in July. Under a 1947 agreement, the United States as the \u201chost country\u201d of the United Nations must admit diplomats of foreign countries to attend if they are on official U.N. business, but Washington says it can deny visas for national security, terrorism or foreign policy reasons.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re connected to a foreign terrorist organization, I don\u2019t know, it seems to me it would be a reasonable thing to think about whether they ought to be prevented to attend a meeting which is about peace,\u201d Pompeo told the reporters traveling with him to Saudi Arabia.\n\nMorello and Wagner reported from Washington.
