While competitors rush to cut prices and capitalise on the global sales event, Apple plays it cool. Why? Well, customers will buy iPhones, iPads and MacBooks regardless.\n\nThe brand boasts a loyal band of followers that are, generally, keen to upgrade their devices the second new versions are released. In September, Apple super-fans queued up to eighteen hours to get their hands on the new iPhone 11 on its launch day.\n\nThankfully, Apple doesn\u2019t forgo Black Friday and Cyber Monday completely. In recent years its eponymous \u2018Store\u2019 has offered gift cards over discounts, incentivising its full-price products.\n\nThese Black Friday gift cards are typically tacked on to the purchase of an iMac, iPad, iPhone or Apple Watch, with the value dependent on the product\u2019s own (from \u00a320 with an iPhone SE to \u00a3120 with an iMac), making them a great choice for people shopping for multiple Apple products.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t, third-party retailers are your best bet. Stores like Carphone Warehouse, Amazon and Currys PC World regularly feature Apple products in their Black Friday deals. Some even take big hits to their profit margin in the hope of having the best Apple deal on Black Friday and increasing their overall traffic.", "description": "Apple, understandably, does not follow the crowd on Black Friday.", "authors": ["Lela London", "Angela Epstein"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/black-friday/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212639067-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
