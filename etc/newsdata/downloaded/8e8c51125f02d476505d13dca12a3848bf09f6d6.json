And that is why we've gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the department of justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/bf/a5/ee39e398492497db7b2524311ac6/harris.png\" true\n\nHarris\u2019s opening was the most direct shot at the president, who is expected to take an in absentia beating tonight. But frontrunner Joe Biden, if the last debate is any measure, is braced for multiple attacks. It\u2019s the first time he has stood on stage with a surging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during the race.\n\nBiden goes on attack\n\nJoe Biden spent the first two debates of the Democratic presidential primary as the frontrunner waiting to get attacked onstage.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden decided to go on the attack and take on the two primary rivals threatening his first place status \u2014 senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2014 over healthcare, prompting a lengthy debate that pitted the more moderate candidates from the more progressive ones.\n\n\u201cI think we should have a debate on health care. I think -- I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked,\u201d Biden said, not so subtly pointing out he was the vice president of the last Democratic president.\n\nBiden said he wants to add \u201cpublic option\u201d to Obamacare and bashed Warren and Sanders for backing Medicare for All. He said his plan \u201ccosts $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion\u201d the way Medicare for All did.\n\nWarren, aware of the perils of attacking Obama, lauded the former president, saying \u201cwe all owe a huge debt to president Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being.\u201d\n\nWarren said that \u201cmiddle class families are going to pay less\u201d with the middle-man of insurance companies gone, giving one of the better applause lines: \u201cI've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d\n\nSanders jumped in and said that Medicare for All would be ultimately cheaper for Americans.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth.\u201d\n\nCastro goes after Biden\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Julian Castro touched off one of the most aggressive exchanges of the Democratic debate when he attacked former Vice President Joe Biden for both his healthcare plan and then allegedly forgetting what he said about it just moments before.\n\nThe attack on Biden\u2019s memory went right to the core of one the biggest controversies nagging the 76-year-old frontrunner: his penchant for verbal gaffes and his occasional memory lapses.\n\nAt issue is Biden\u2019s plan to allow for a so-called \u201cpublic option\u201d for Obamacare that would allow people to have government-run health insurance or keep their private insurance plans. He said anyone could qualify and \u201cbuy in.\u201d\n\nBut Castro, pointing to his poor grandmother\u2019s struggles with diabetes, criticized Biden\u2019s plan for leaving 10 million uninsured people and said former President Obama \u201cwanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\u201d\n\nBiden bristled: \u201cThey do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Castro sprung.\n\n\u201cYou just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago they would have to buy in,\u201d Castro said.\n\nBiden started to say that \u201cpoor people anyone like your grandmother who has no money,\u201d but Castro was busy zeroing in on his memory as jeers and cheers erupted from the crowd.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said. \u201cI can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.\u201d\n\nOther candidates onstage started objecting, with Pete Buttigieg giving the clearest rebuke.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington,\u201d the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said. \u201cScores points against each other. Poking at each other. And telling each other that -- my plan, your plan. Look, we all...\u201d\n\nCastro then cut him off: \u201cThat's called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That's called an election. That's an election. You know? This is what we're here for. It's an election.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, \u201cbut a house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we're going to win this.\u201d", "description": "Kamala Harris kicked off Thursday night\u2019s debate in Houston by addressing an audience of one: Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Marc Caputo"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7e/ff/223df57648f0bd29b83ee5aa6e7d/20190912-kamala-harris-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
