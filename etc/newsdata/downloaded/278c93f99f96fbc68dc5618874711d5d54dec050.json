He was not punished. He is the only manager in the English league that cannot be punished for these things.\"\n\nBenitez also suggested that United were given more time to prepare for games, despite Ferguson's constant protests about fixture congestion.\n\n\"If he wants to talk about fixtures, and have a level playing field as you say in England,\" Benitez continued.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"There are two options - very clear - if we don't want more problems with fixtures. One is the same as in Spain, the draw for the first part of the league is known, everyone knows which weekend. In the second half everyone plays the opposite, so you all know.\n\n\u201dOr there is another option. That Mr Ferguson organises the fixtures in his office and sends it to us and everyone will know and cannot complain. That is simple.\"\n\nOf course, Manchester United went on to win the title that year, four points ahead of Liverpool.\n\nBenitez may not have realised, but he had entered into the exact phase of mental warfare in which Ferguson thrived - the Scot had got under the Spaniard's skin and ultimately defeated him.\n\nWatch the full tirade here:", "description": "Benitez may not have realised it at the time, but he had just handed a crucial title advantage ton Ferguson's Manchester United", "authors": ["Joe Cooper", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20609668.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-132029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
