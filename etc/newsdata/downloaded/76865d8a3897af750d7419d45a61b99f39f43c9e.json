And Starbucks Is The Target", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Starbucks has had a rough go of it in recent weeks. First, a local franchise in Tempe, Arizona asked five police officers to leave because their presence triggered some precious snowflake. The word \u201cunsafe\u201d was used\u2014a typical word used by the soy boy segment of society. Now, we have some guy named \u201cAziz,\u201d who felt discriminated against because the barista put \u201cISIS\u201d on his order. Was it intentional? It doesn\u2019t sound like it. Commentator Stephen Miller aptly noted that in the loud environment of Starbucks, this \u201cAziz\u201d incident could have been a simple case of mishearing one\u2019s name. We\u2019ve all been to a Starbucks. It's easy to see how this misunderstanding came about, but now we have this grassy knoll mentality concerning a coffee cup (via WaPo):\n\nNiquel Johnson paid for three drinks in Philadelphia on Sunday, and in typical Starbucks fashion, an employee asked for his name. Johnson, 40, told them \u201cAziz,\u201d his Islamic name pronounced ah-zeez. He has used it for 25 years \u2014 and \u201ccountless\u201d times at that particular store. But three unusual things happened on this occasion, he said. When his order was ready, a staffer announced them by drink type, not his name. The second unusual part was the employee wrote his name as \u201cISIS\u201d \u2014 the acronym for the Islamic terror group \u2014 in the printout attached to all three drinks. Johnson didn\u2019t even realize it until later, when a friend pointed it out at a bookstore. \u201cI was shocked and angry. I felt it was discrimination,\u201d Johnson told The Washington Post \u2026\n\n[Warning: Some strong langauge]:\n\nCongrats guys, you just got a barista probably fired for mishearing a name in a loud working environment. https://t.co/0TIUAiSnvx \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) August 31, 2019\n\nSo ridiculous. There is no evidence of discrimination here. Rather obvious what happened. There are a million people with extremely thin skin that make a huge issue out of every bad experience. Except most don\u2019t get a national story written about it. \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) August 31, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re not the enemy of the people.. Also yo that barista misheard a dude, lets go fuck their life up with the weight of millions of dollars behind us. \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) August 31, 2019\n\nYep. And I know someone with a similar sounding name. Obviously the barista should have been more careful.m, but this isn\u2019t a national case and the guy does not come off looking good with the \u201can apology is not enough\u201d stuff. \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) August 31, 2019\n\nJohnson said in The Post at the time that he was thinking about suing the coffee chain. Starbucks isn\u2019t deterred, saying it didn't see any bias (via KDVR):", "description": ".09/04/2019 19:39:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/291/ee6ca349-6bd2-4175-bbb0-d18145c89e7c.jpg"}
