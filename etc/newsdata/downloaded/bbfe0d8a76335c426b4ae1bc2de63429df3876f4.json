The radar chip that is used on the Pixel 4 phones is very small, but it may still be something that isn't permitted. Or so we are guessing,\" tech journalist Mala Bhargava told the BBC.\n\nAnd the disappointment is palpable.\n\n\"What's surprising here is that Google did not think of an alternative considering the limited feasibility of Project Soli... Google hardly seems to have made much effort to launch the phone without Soli or by disabling it in countries where it's frequency band is not available,\" the Times of India newspaper said.\n\n\"Google failing to realize that a marquee feature like Soli won't work everywhere once again shows just how incompetent the company is at hardware,\" railed another website.\n\n\"Google's Pixel phones are eagerly anticipated because they have a few things techies really love. First there's the pure Android experience with the very newest features and subsequent timely updates. Second, there's the thrill of owning a smartphone that's at the cutting edge of software. And third and most important is the game-changing camera,\" Ms Bhargava said.\n\nThe Pixel 4 camera has been pitched by Google as being able to take the kind of astrophotography images that required specialist camera kit in the past.\n\nRead more about the Pixel 4 here", "description": "Tech analysts speculate the issue is with a radar feature that uses a frequency not allowed in India.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DDA7/production/_109234765_1aa3a733-e815-4a01-9792-0e14257b6ed0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
