Three Norwegian lawmakers nominated [Thunberg] for the Nobel Peace Prize this year because they believe \u201cthe massive movement Greta has set in motion is a very important peace contribution.\u201d Last year, about three months into her school climate strike campaign, Thunberg declined another award \u2014 the Children\u2019s Climate Prize, which is awarded by a Swedish electricity company \u2014 because many of the finalists had to fly to Stockholm for the ceremony.\n\nThunberg thanked the council in the statement, calling it a \u201chuge honor\u201d but said \u201cpoliticians and the people in power\u201d need to listen to science and take action, according to a BBC report:\n\nIn an Instagram post explaining her decision to turn down the prize money of 500,000 kronor (\u00a340,000; \u20ac46,000), Ms Thunberg said: \u201cThe Nordic countries have a great reputation around the world when it comes to climate and environmental issues.\n\n\u201cThere is no lack of bragging about this,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cThere is no lack of beautiful words.\u201d\n\nThunberg added that the energy consumption in the Nordic region of the world tells \u201ca whole other story.\u201d\n\nIn the post she cited a report from from World Wide Fund for Nature and the Global Footprint Network, which stated that Sweden and most of the Nordic region \u201clives as if the world has the resources of four planets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe belong to the countries that have the possibility to do the most,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cAnd yet our countries still basically do nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nordic Council encourages co-operation between parliaments in countries including Denmark, Finland and Ms Thunberg\u2019s home country Sweden,\u201d the BBC reported.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Swedish teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday turned down a $52,000 environmental prize from the Nordic Council.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/public-meeting-Greta-Thunberg-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
