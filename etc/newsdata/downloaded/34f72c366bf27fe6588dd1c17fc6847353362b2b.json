During the speech, Pence noted The Heritage Foundation\u2019s unique status in the conservative movement, saying:\n\n\u201cYou know, The Heritage Foundation is a flagship of freedom. Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has been advancing conservative public policy based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, traditional values, and, from its very founding, focused on a strong national defense. And now for nearly half a century, it\u2019s undeniable The Heritage Foundation has made a difference for America\u2026I have to be honest with you, The Heritage Foundation will always feel like home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to have the vice president at The Heritage Foundation President\u2019s Club Meeting and Gala next month,\u201d Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James said. \u201cHe has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us in the biggest battles. He\u2019s fought in the pro-life trenches. He\u2019s an advocate for religious liberty, a defender of the Second Amendment, and a champion of free markets, individual freedom, and limited government.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, The Heritage Foundation broke a fundraising record at a donor event in California in May, raising $14.2 million in one weekend.
