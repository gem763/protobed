Investigators later said Smollett staged that attack with the help of two acquaintances.\n\nSmollett was arrested on Feb. 21 and a 16-count indictment was returned on March 7.\n\nBut less than 3 weeks later, prosecutors abruptly dropped the charges after the actor, who starred in the Fox TV series Empire, agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bond and performed community service.\n\nSmollett has consistently denied that he faked the attack. But the City of Chicago and its police department maintain that he did and in the complaint, the city is asking for a jury trial \"to recover civil penalties, statutory treble damages, and attorney's fees and costs arising from the Defendant's false statements to the City.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Teresa Crawford/AP Teresa Crawford/AP\n\nThe complaint outlines the allegations against Smollett in detail, citing text messages, GPS records and statements made to police by his alleged accomplices.
