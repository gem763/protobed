And now nearly 50,000 U.A.W. employees at General Motors plants across the country are set to walk off the job, barring a breakthrough in the talks, in the first such strike since 2007.\n\n\u201cToday, we stand strong and say with one voice, we are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people in this nation,\u201d Terry Dittes, a union vice president, said after the meeting.\n\nThe U.A.W. is pushing G.M. to improve wages, reopen idled plants, add jobs at others and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. G.M. wants employees to share a greater portion of their health care costs, and to increase work-force productivity and flexibility in factories. Although the company has been earning substantial profits in North America, it has idled four plants in the United States as car sales slide and overall demand weakens.", "description": "The union and G.M. remain far apart on most of the major issues on the table.
