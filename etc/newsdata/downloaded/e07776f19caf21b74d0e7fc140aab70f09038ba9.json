It was set to begin at midnight, after the union\u2019s current bargaining agreement expired on Saturday.\n\n\u201cToday, we stand strong and say with one voice, we are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people in this nation,\u201d Terry Dittes, a union vice president, said after the meeting.\n\nThe U.A.W. is pushing G.M. to improve wages, reopen idled plants, add jobs at others and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. G.M. wants employees to pay a greater portion of their health care costs, and to increase work-force productivity and flexibility in factories.", "description": "The union and G.M. remain far apart on most of the major issues on the table.
