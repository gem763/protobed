AMZN, -1.22% disclosed Friday that it chose not to buy back any of its stock during the third quarter, extending its quarterly streak of no repurchases to 30. The stock sank 6.1% in premarket trading, after the e-commerce giant reported disappointing third-quarter results and provided a downbeat holiday-quarter outlook.

The last time Amazon bought back shares was the first quarter of 2012, when it spent $960 million to repurchase 5.3 million shares. The company has never paid a dividend, since going public in May 1997, according to FactSet data. According to Amazon's 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Friday, Amazon had 495,797,220 shares outstanding as of Oct. 16, up from 494,656,015 shares as of July 17.
