Medal holders also receive an allowance from the government for their entire lives. And although they don\u2019t win medals, families of four children or more are still provided with a financial support programme until the kids are aged 21.\n\nThe practice of decorating these mums goes back to the Soviet Union, which established a \u2018mother heroine\u2019 award in 1944 for families with 10 or more children. Although awards now go to smaller families than they did in Soviet times, keeping the birth rate high is still very much a priority for the Kazakh government.\n\n\u201cEverybody always talks about it, to have more children, to make our population bigger,\u201d says Aksana Eleusezova of Kazakhstan\u2019s Department of Labour and Social Programmes.\n\nEditing by Bernadette Young.", "description": "In Kazakhstan, a long-standing Soviet tradition honours \u2018hero mothers\u2019 with medals for having very large families.", "authors": ["Taylor Weidman", "Azat Ruziev"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/b0/p07rb03x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
