(Image: Cartoon Network)\n\nSteven Universe: The Movie does a lot to acknowledge the great strides the series has made since it began six years ago, but on top of that, it\u2019s also a grand celebration of something the series has long been passionate about: musical theatre. Not only is The Movie a full-on, all-singing-all-dancing spectacle, it\u2019s a very good one.\n\nBeyond being catchy as all hell \u2014 frankly, it contains an almost dangerous quantity of catchiness \u2014 the soundtrack to Steven Universe: The Movie is a culmination of the show\u2019s long experimentation with music as a storytelling tool.\n\nIt\u2019s a celebration of not just the series\u2019 lyrical capacity to communicate character through song, but its melodic and instrumental world-building as well. Suffice to say, after hearing it for the first time, we fell in love, and then just proceeded to listen to it over, and over, and over (and over!) again!\n\nAs it\u2019s wormed its way into our ears over the course of the last week, Gizmodo's very own Diamond Authorities \u2014 namely James and Charles \u2014 had to sit down and talk about it, and what it could all mean for Steven Universe as it charts a new future for itself.\n\nJames Whitbrook: Charles, we\u2019ve been talking privately about the soundtrack to Steven Universe: The Movie for a hot minute, but if we don\u2019t talk about it openly I think I might start going insane. And with the movie out, now we can!\n\nI wanted to ask you, coming into the movie the first time, what was your reaction upon realising that this thing was gonna be a full-on musical? Because Steven Universe has always had a strong musical component, but this is on another level.\n\nCharles Pulliam-Moore: Do... not, uh, take this the wrong way, but my first reaction was mild concern, not because I didn\u2019t have faith in whether the creative team could make a proper musical, but because I don\u2019t always find musicals to be the most enjoyable experience. They\u2019re extra, and they\u2019re meant to be, but the way in which that extra-ness is pulled off varies wildly and sometimes a show you think you might love ends up being something you loathe, you know?\n\nBut then the opening credits started with that grandiose, Old Hollywood OOMPH, and I was immediately sold. Cause I\u2019m a sucker for that mess.\n\nSteven and his friends take a bow during the film\u2019s finale. (Image: Cartoon Network)\n\nJames: Hahaha, honestly, when I first read your review, I was in a similar space \u2014 not that I wasn\u2019t sure they couldn\u2019t pull it off, but more if it could become almost too much of a good thing, somehow?\n\nBut almost immediately I was surprised with the intensity of it \u2014 song after song after song \u2014 and that, despite that, there\u2019s so many smart, great details in each piece that I didn\u2019t get tired. It was a blast, start to finish. I haven\u2019t been able to stop listening to it since the movie aired, and I\u2019m weirdly not tired of any of it yet.\n\nCharles: Well, I think there\u2019s something there to dig into. Steven Universe has always been a show with musical numbers in it rather than a Musical\u2122, mainly because of the show\u2019s format. While you can (and should) listen to those songs as musical pieces of art in order to get a better understanding of the overall narrative, when you\u2019re watching from episode to episode, the songs are these discrete things.\n\nHere, the entire story\u2019s this enclosed tale that you get the beginning, middle, and end to in a single setting, and because these songs in particular are what drives the story forward, you can\u2019t help but want to listen to the album as a whole thing.\n\nJames: The way the full soundtrack is presented as a continuous thing is really interesting \u2014 and even when I\u2019ve cut the playlist down to just the vocal pieces on it, I\u2019ve not tried actually just shuffling them all up yet, because I like the flow of, in a way, almost getting to re-experience the movie slightly fast-forwarded.\n\nThe way these songs are placed into the story, and how they interplay with each other thematically and rhythmically, referencing each other or adding context to each other (like how \u201cLet Us Adore You\u201d pairs with \u201cFound\u201d when it\u2019s reprised), is done with such deftness it almost feels scandalous to hear it out of order.\n\nWhich has been fine so far when I\u2019m still in this honeymoon period with it and happy to hear it all in one go, but like, you know\u2026 someday I\u2019m just gonna wanna hear \u201cIsn\u2019t It Love?\u201d as is and I wonder if it\u2019ll hold up in isolation. Hopefully it does, because I think it might sneakily be my favourite Garnet song the series has ever done now. Have you got any current highlights like that?\n\nCharles: We\u2019re on the same page, more or less, about whether the songs hold up individually. Or, we were on the same page. Depending on my specific mood and how much time I\u2019ve got to sing to myself, both \u201cLet Us Adore You\u201d and its reprisal are definitely my favourite songs of the series \u2014 even though, out of context, they don\u2019t have anywhere near the same kind of heft as \u201cIt\u2019s Over, Isn\u2019t It?\u201d or \u201cStronger Than You.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something deliciously high camp about listening to Christine Ebersole, Lisa Hannigan, and Patti Lupone going full-on exasperated auntie \u2014 while harmonising \u2014 and collapsing all over your throne rooms like the overgrown drama queens they\u2019ve always been.\n\nAs much grief as certain segments of the fandom give the series for having its villains... whatever the opposite of \u201cturn heel\u201d is...\u201cLet Us Adore You\u201d perfectly captures this fundamental rigidity that the Homeworld Gems have. Steven and the Crystal Gems can only soften it but so much, because while Steven\u2019s been about changing people\u2019s minds, he\u2019s never been especially interested in changing who people are, if that makes any sense?\n\nJames: Totally \u2014 it\u2019s this sort of sense that Steven gets across in \u201cChange\u201d really well \u2014 he has the power to change things, but it\u2019s mostly through inspiring others to see it in themselves to do so if they want it. \u201cLet Us Adore You\u201d gets it across in that cutesy manner of casting the Diamonds as overbearing gem mums, but there\u2019s a similar intent. Plus, all that harmonising, god, it\u2019s so good.\n\nSpeaking of which, I think one song I actually like more out of context on the soundtrack is \u201cHappily Ever After,\u201d weirdly enough \u2014 despite it being a sort of \u201cstory song\u201d in that it\u2019s essentially catching us up on who each member of the Crystal Gems is, before Spinel robs them of that.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of Steven Universe: The Song, in that it encapsulates the entire series\u2019 myriad musical styles, its main characters, and that it\u2019s, uh, catchy as all hell. It reminded me a lot of that special extended version of \u201cWe Are the Crystal Gems\u201d they put out for Comic-Con a few years ago.\n\nCharles: See, now that\u2019s where we kinda differ. I like a lot of things about \u201cHappily Ever After,\u201d but as a full song, it\u2019s just so much to take in, and the part of me that, initially, was like \u201cyes, yes, Pearl was the musical theatre gay of the group, I would like to meet the new Gem, please\u201d definitely kicked in while I watching the movie for the first time. That being said, the little clever asides like Garnet\u2019s \u201cI have every idea what everyone\u2019s doing\u201d definitely make the song worth listening to.\n\nJames: There\u2019s so many great little details musically there too, like how each of the Gem\u2019s verses is backed by their \u201ccharacter\u201d instruments in a way \u2014 the piano of Pearl\u2019s, the synthy bass of Garnet \u2014 and how you get little callbacks to their past solo songs as little leitmotifs fitting into the backing track.\n\nBut, speaking of the new Gem, let\u2019s talk the big songs for Spinel (Sarah Stiles): \u201cOther Friends,\u201d \u201cDrift Away,\u201d and then her duet with Steven in \u201cFound.\u201d She brings something new to the table that really shakes up the musical vibe of the series for me over the course of these songs, and it\u2019s clever how it ties into her Fleischer-cartoon-esque old-timey aesthetic and animation style:\n\nShe\u2019s a ragtime icon. And I love it.\n\nCharles: We talked about this way back when, but Steven Universe: The Movie splits the difference between your average TV series, essentially beginning an entirely new season that begins with a time jump, and a Very Special Adventure type of film that you often see in big-screen anime productions, like all of the Pok\u00e9mon movies and My Hero Academia: Two Heroes.\n\nSpinel, to my mind, functioned as a really great bridge between the two kinds of narrative styles because while the movie (and also her musical stylings) could have just been one-and-done, semi-canonical bits of the larger story, the movie puts them squarely within the context of the established story. The entire movie is more or less a condensation of your expected Steven Universe arc, you know? Villain shows up, villain damn near kills everyone, things get bad, there\u2019s some singing, and what do you know, the villain\u2019s good again.\n\nBut by making Spinel\u2019s motivation directly connected to Pink Diamond\u2019s betrayal, literally the thing that set the entire series into motion, she doesn\u2019t end up feeling like a tacked-on character whose only purpose was to give the other Gems a villain to face off against. She\u2019s always been a part of Pink\u2019s story just, uh, off somewhere in the galaxy lost and forgotten.\n\nJames: They do such a good job of rooting Spinel into the past of the Gems through the music as well \u2014 there\u2019s moments in songs like \u201cWho We Are\u201d and then the reprise of \u201cLet Us Adore You\u201d where you hear the beat and style associated with her subtly blend in and out as she sings a line or becomes involved in a scene and it\u2019s such an interesting way of grounding her, even as aesthetically from the rest of the cast through her bouncy animation.\n\nThere\u2019s a great interplay between that contrast/familiarity that makes her truly feel like, paradoxically, she\u2019s been there as part of Steven Universe all the time even though she clearly hasn\u2019t, metatextually.\n\nCharles: It\u2019s right down to Spinel\u2019s aesthetics even, that I think speak to her circumstances in this really devastating way that you might not immediately pick up on. We\u2019ve seen Gems created specifically for other Gems in the past like all of the Diamonds\u2019 Pearls, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a Gem who was created to look so much like their owner in a way that I think speaks to how the Diamonds saw Pink at the time and what Pink\u2019s personality was.\n\nSpinel is more or less just a caricature of Pink right down to the style of her clothing, and it makes you understand that unlike Pearls who seem to be created with a variety of different functions in mind, Spinel was really only ever meant to have one specific, two-dimensional bit.\n\nYou get why Pink would grow frustrated with her after a while, especially at a point in her life when she felt she needed to become a mature Diamond worthy of having her own colony. But that\u2019s not to say that any of what happened to Spinel is Spinel\u2019s fault \u2014 she honestly didn\u2019t understand because Pink never even made the effort, and that\u2019s really the tragedy.\n\nJames: They get into the melancholy of it in \u201cDrift Away,\u201d which I think of Spinel\u2019s three big songs might be my favourite of hers. The way it takes that sort of bounce that characterises her animation and the ragtime rhythm of \u201cOld Friends\u201d and it becomes this waltzing ballad is such a great way of evoking that slow realisation she has of being left behind over the course of the song. Sarah Stiles kills it, with that mix of regret and like you say, this very Pink Diamond-y childlike naivet\u00e9.\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken a lot about what\u2019s worked for us in these songs, but is there anything \u2014 even though we\u2019re pretty effusive about it overall \u2014 that stands out to you as disappointing on the soundtrack?\n\nCharles: Originally, I had two, but I\u2019ve softened a little on one of them. Initially, I had a bit of difficulty getting used to Zach Callison\u2019s performance as older Steven because I\u2019ve just become so used to his kid voice. But the more I\u2019ve listened to the album, the more I\u2019ve settled on the idea that he\u2019s doing something very specific in terms of vocally telegraphing that Steven\u2019s, you know, a teen whose voice is still in the process of changing, so some of his singing parts are a little... rough?\n\nMy only other major quibble was with Michaela Dietz\u2019s solo in \u201cDisobedient,\u201d which has this really warped sonic quality to it that\u2019s so at odds with the rest of the song that I thought it actually took away from the song.\n\nJames: I get what you\u2019re saying about Callison\u2019s voice \u2014 there\u2019s a great little moment in \u201cChange\u201d where, for the most part he\u2019s in that lower vocal register, got his powers back, got his groove again, but then when he starts appealing that Spinel can change his voice gets higher and cracks ever so slightly, and ugh, I love it. He really does feel like a teen in that awkward, transitory phase, vocally speaking.\n\nHonestly, this is going to sound like a cheap complaint, but I think my biggest disappointment with the soundtrack is what isn\u2019t on it, rather than what is. Some of its down to scheduling issues for actors, presumably, but I am really sad that we didn\u2019t get more Peridot and Lapis on the soundtrack \u2014 Lapis got \u201cThat Distant Shore\u201d on the show, and Peridot got \u201cPeace and Love (On Planet Earth)\u201d to some extent, but I\u2019ve been longing for a proper big song for her for a while, and both she and Lapis get sort of left on the sidelines here. Just\u2026 give me more! Of everything!\n\nCharles: Hard agree, though if I were to play devil\u2019s advocate, perhaps if everyone got a full-on song, the movie might have begun to feel a little overlong? Maaaybe?\n\nJames: Oh, who needs things like plot and pacing when you could have SONGS!? Just an excuse for them to get to a sequel already, frankly.\n\nSpeaking of the future \u2014 because here we are in it \u2014 Rebecca Sugar has repeatedly made it clear there\u2019s more Steven Universe beyond the movie, so where do you think, musically speaking, the series goes from this soundtrack?\n\nThis feels like such a culmination of all the things the series has been building towards so far, sonically, all these little leitmotifs and lyrical experimentations, that it almost feels like it\u2019s a goodbye before they move on to a new kind of soundscape, which would be befitting of Steven and the Gems having matured and changed themselves up to this point.\n\nCharles: In feeling like such an artistic level up from the series, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see whether the future of the series settles back down to a narrative level that feels more in-line with the story before the movie or whether we\u2019re scheduled for a paradigm shift.\n\nThere\u2019s part of me that feels as if the show might not introduce yet another long-forgotten Gem with a bone to pick because it took all of the movie\u2019s time to make her story feel distinct and not like your run-of-the-mill baddie.\n\nA friend of mine pointed out this nifty little tidbit the fandom picked up on about, ironically, \u201cEverything Stays\u201d from the Adventure Time finale mapping almost perfectly onto Spinel\u2019s story.\n\nSugar worked on both Adventure Time and Steven Universe and she\u2019s spoken about the song being inspired by an actual event from her childhood, but I bring it up just to say how much creative energy was obviously poured into the movie, and I can\u2019t exactly imagine the Crewniverse coming back and saying \u201cah, well, let\u2019s turn that energy down now.\u201d\n\nNot in the sense that every episode\u2019s going to be a production the way the movie was, but that things are just going to have to change going forward.\n\nJames: I think that\u2019s the most exciting thing for me, from a musical point of view\u2014I came into this unsure if they could really pull off something with the scale of a proper musical, even with the show\u2019s past history with some really great musical setpieces.\n\nNow that they have, I want to see what else they can do, what they can experiment with, not just in storytelling through music, but just in terms of the show\u2019s entire soundscape. If it\u2019s time for Steven and the Gems themselves to take stock of how far they\u2019ve come, this soundtrack feels representative of the series\u2019 own sound in a similar way, and while it moves on to a new future, it stands as a great testament to everything Steven Universe has done musically up to this point.\n\nI\u2019m\u2026 just gonna put my headphones back on and listen to \u201cHappily Ever After\u201d a dozen more times now we\u2019ve talked about this, ok?", "description": "Steven Universe: The Movie does a lot to acknowledge the great strides the series has made since it began six years ago, but on top of that, it\u2019s also a grand celebration of something the series has long been passionate about: musical theatre.
