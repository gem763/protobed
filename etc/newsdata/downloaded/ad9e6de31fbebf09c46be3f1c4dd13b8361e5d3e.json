Chief Says He Has Been Tough With China Over Muslims", "language": "en", "text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has strongly rejected claims by five human rights groups that he hasn\u2019t condemned the Chinese government\u2019s detention of more than a million Muslims in the Xinjiang region, saying he has spoken out forcefully.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has been more persistent and more clear in talking to the Chinese authorities in relation to this issue than myself,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt is absolutely not true that I\u2019ve only done discreet diplomacy.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Guterres said that during his visit to Beijing in April, \u201cI not only did raise the issue, but I made it public.\u201d\n\nThe five rights groups said in a letter to the secretary-general circulated Tuesday that he would make an important contribution to addressing \u201cone of the most pressing human rights issues of our time\u201d by speaking out against China\u2019s internment of the Uighurs and members of other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups and calling for the immediate closure of detention camps for them.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It has sharply criticized 22 Western countries that called for an end to mass arbitrary detentions and other abuses of Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.\n\nIn a report earlier this year to counter criticism of internment camps and other oppressive security in the traditionally Islamic region, China said it had arrested nearly 13,000 people it described as \u201cterrorists\u201d and had broken up hundreds of \u201cterrorist gangs\u201d in Xinjiang since 2014.\n\nThe five rights organizations cautioned Guterres \u201cagainst any action that might lend credence to Beijing\u2019s narrative that the unlawful detention of over a million Uighurs and other Muslims is a necessary measure to counter terrorism.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Antonio Guterres strongly rejects claims by rights groups that he hasn't been forceful enough on the issue with Beijing.", "authors": ["Edith M.
