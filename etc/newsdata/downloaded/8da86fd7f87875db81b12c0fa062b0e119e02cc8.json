It was a difficult game. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we started sloppy. We took the lead in the game but we didn\u2019t deserve to.\n\n\u201cThe second half we controlled the game a lot more than the first half but we gave them a sloppy goal to win the game. We do need to improve on that.\n\n\u201cObviously you are wanting to develop partnerships. Sometimes in international level you can\u2019t really do that.\n\n\u201cYou have players who aren\u2019t playing for their clubs so they don\u2019t get selected, and you have players that pick up injuries.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to adapt. That\u2019s one of the tricky parts of playing international football, every camp you\u2019re normally playing alongside different players \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be \u2013 and need to develop new partnerships.\n\n\u201cBut listen, there\u2019s no excuses. We need to be better than Friday night. We need to be better going forward. We need to be better on the ball. And we certainly need to be better at keeping the ball out of the net.\u201d\n\nWhile admitting the performance was not up to task, Maguire refuted claims the defence has been poor in recent England internationals \u2013 despite looking shaky in a 5-3 win over Kosovo last month and gifting Holland goals in the 3-1 Nations League semi-final defeat at the start of the summer.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018run of shipping goals\u2019 I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s come from apart from the Kosovo game,\u201d he said when asked if Southgate had addressed any defensive shortcomings.\n\n\u201cWe were 5-1 up in the game and obviously we\u2019d made a mistake early on in giving them a goal. But we were 5-1 up and maybe we took our foot off the gas and have to learn from that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve conceded two on Friday and previous to that we\u2019ve not conceded numerous goals so I don\u2019t know where it (the claim they are \u2018shipping goals\u2019) has come from apart from the last couple of games.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard and try and improve. But shipping lots and lots of goals over the last couple of years we haven\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cIt just shows us that we\u2019ve still a lot of work to go. We\u2019re still in a strong position in the group and now we have got to finish the job off.\n\n\u201cWe do need to nullify little areas to take into the Euros because if we do manage to qualify, we have to nullify these mistakes.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "England\u2018s disappointing defeat in the Czech Republic could have been down to a number of players heading into the international break in poor club form, according to Harry Maguire.
