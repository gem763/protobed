I think he'll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway...so it's just one of those things,\" said manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nArgentine Sergio Romero is expected to stand in for De Gea and can expect a busy time against Klopp's potent attack.\n\nFrench midfielder Paul Pogba has not yet recovered fully from his ankle injury but there is better news on the fitness of on the fitness of forward Anthony Martial and full backs Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\n\n\"I can't tell you 100 percent (who) is going to be fit as something might happen,\" said Solskjaer.\n\n\"But hopefully Aaron and Anthony will last the training this week and be available for selection. If it's for half a game or 30 minutes I don't know but let's see where they're at,\" he said.\n\nUnited's Spanish midfielder Juan Mata believes the clash with their old rivals offers an opportunity to kick-start the season.\n\n\"We have a great chance to change the dynamic and we are all very motivated to take the win. We are United, we are playing at home and we will give everything to be able to take the victory that our fans deserve in such a special game,\" Mata said.\n\nChampions Manchester City face a tricky trip to Selhurst Park to face a Crystal Palace team who beat them at the Etihad in January.\n\nCity are eight points adrift of Liverpool. Palace sit just two points behind City in sixth position after an impressive start to the season, but this fixture is the first of a straight run of five against sides directly above them.\n\nTottenham Hotspur, beaten 3-0 at Brighton & Hove Albion last time out, will look to bounce back against winless bottom club Watford.\n\nFourth-placed Leicester City host Burnley who are seventh and Frank Lampard's improving Chelsea entertain Newcastle on Saturday.\n\nThird-placed Arsenal visit Sheffield United on Monday.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Premier League leaders Liverpool head to Old Trafford on Sunday to face Manchester United and rarely have the odds been so in favor of an away win.
