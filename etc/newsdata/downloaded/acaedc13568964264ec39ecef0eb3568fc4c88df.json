But iPhones get this for free!\n\nReuters/Google\n\nYes, you read that right. Google has not been compressing the images uploaded using an iPhone on Google Photos, and allowing uploads of original quality, for free (something that Pixel devices could also do in the past). But how is the iPhone getting the same treatment.\n\nEver Since iOS 11, iPhone's have been capturing images in a different file type called HEIC instead of the commonly used JPEG or JPG. Now, the compression algorithm applied by HEIC is so perfect that the file size is actually smaller than Google's JPG compression.\n\nDon't Miss 3.5 K SHARES 190 SHARES 175 SHARES\n\nMoreover, Google doesn't go ahead and compress them further is because if it tries doing that, the file size becomes larger. Moreover, doing this would require Google to use computational power, even when it's not at all necessary. This was discovered in the subreddit r/apple by u/stephenvsawyer.\n\nApple\n\nSo now you have one more reason to pick the iPhone 11 or the iPhone 11 Pros instead of the Pixel.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 gets a 5.7-inch full-HD+ display whereas Pixel 4XL gets a slightly larger 6.3-inch QHD+ display. Both these are OLED panels with Google's 'Smooth Motion' (90Hz refresh rate) technology.\n\nGoogle\n\nPixel 4 and Pixel 4XL get a dual-camera setup at the back with a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a secondary telephoto 16-megapixel sensor. The device also gets a single 8-megapixel selfie shooter.\n\nUnder the hood, the phones are still using the dated Snapdragon 855 paired with 6GB of RAM and 64/128GB storage variants. Powering the Pixel 4 is a disappointing 2800mAh battery, whereas the Pixel 4XL gets a 3700mAh battery.", "description": "Many people were disappointed with the Pixel 4, either with the phone not coming to India, or due to the fact that it has an unimpressive set of hardware.
