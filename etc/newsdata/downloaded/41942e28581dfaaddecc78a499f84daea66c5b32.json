Joey Tribbiani Sure, over the years, Joey provided the show with some of its best-known one-liners (see: \u201cJoey doesn\u2019t share food!\u201d and \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d). He was also a recurrent source of situational comedy (see: Joey locking himself into his media unit to prove a point, only for all his and Chandler\u2019s belongings to get robbed). Still, it\u2019s hard to compare his goofiness to Chandler\u2019s dryness or Phoebe\u2019s knack for the absurd. Getty Images/NBC/Newsmakers 2/6 5. Ross Geller (tie) Ross probably thought he was a good guy, but his record shows otherwise. He cheated on Rachel (no, they were not on a break) then tried to get her back; he dated one of his students; he challenged Phoebe\u2019s belief that her mother had been reincarnated in a cat (which, sure, he\u2019s entitled to his doubts, but could he not just drop it?); and he wasn\u2019t the best brother to Monica, nor was he the best father to his son Ben. Getty Images/Warner Bros Television 3/6 5. Monica Geller (tie) This might be an unpopular opinion, since Monica is such a beloved character, but: I have never found her laugh-out-loud funny. Sure, her excessive competitiveness and cleanliness were amusing, but it was no match for Phoebe\u2019s otherworldliness or Chandler\u2019s bitterness. Sorry.

She sang \u201cCopacabana\u201d in that terrible bridesmaid dress at her ex-fiance\u2019s Barry\u2019s wedding, for one. She fell violently to the ground while trying to escape from Ross and his new girlfriend Julie during an ill-fated attempt to welcome Ross at the airport. She unsuccessfully tried to woo her crush Joshua with a cheerleading routine at a party. Let\u2019s make it official: Rachel was a hoot. Getty Images/NBC 5/6 2. Chandler Bing Chandler\u2019s friends derided Chandler\u2019s humour pretty much every time as they acknowledged it \u2013 undeservedly so. The man was a master at banter! Sure, he used it as a defense mechanism, but who could blame him? Plus, he wasn\u2019t great at the advice, but he could always interest you in a sarcastic comment.

Remember when she sang along to Ross\u2019s terrible attempt at playing the bagpipes? What about when she told Rachel her maternity trousers would be great for shoplifting melons? Good times.

Getty Images/Warner Bros Television\n\n\u201cI was in the last episode, which made no sense to me whatsoever,\u201d he continued, revealing that he was on the soundstage filming the final episode where he saw Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel Green, crying and hugging series co-creator Marta Kauffman.\n\n\u201cI thought, I\u2019m not supposed to be there,\u201d Rudd, who would later star with Aniston in Wanderlust, said. \u201cSo to break the ice I went over and just went, \u2018We did it, huh? What a ride.\u2019 The joke inevitably fell flat.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, it was revealed that Rudd's character Mike wasn't supposed to become such a regular fixture on the show.\n\nHank Azaria, who played Mike's love rival David, said the initial plan was to bring his character back, but Friends showrunners were so impressed with Rudd they decided to keep him on the show.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that was the end of David,\u201d the actor said of his character's departure to Minsk. \u201cThe plan always was kind of to bring him back. I think, honestly, what happened was Paul Rudd is so awesome that they sort of found a groove with him and [my character] became more of just the grist for that mill. As opposed to the other way around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt actually did sting a little bit,\u201d Azeria responded when asked how he felt about the decision. \u201cWhatever part of me is David the Science Guy who went to Minsk, which admittedly is probably a small part of me [laughs], but that part of me wanted to end up with Phoebe. So I was sort of sad when I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe certainly has gone on to prove that he was deserving of Phoebe\u2019s love,\u201d Azaria added of Rudd. \u201cHe\u2019s a handsome devil. He\u2019s actually annoyingly handsome. He shouldn\u2019t really be allowed to be that handsome. He\u2019s like the Tom Brady of comedy.\u201d\n\nRudd\u2019s new series Living With Yourself is released on Netflix on 18 October.
