With 93% of the vote counted on Thursday, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and Mr. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party were tied with enough votes for 32 seats each in the 120-seat parliament, known as the Knesset, according to an analysis by the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.\n\nMr. Gantz\u2019s bloc of centrist, left-wing and Arab parties appeared set to get 55 seats, while Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition of right-wing and religious parties would get 56. Either would need the help of the small party, Yisrael Beiteinu, which looks set to get nine seats and is calling for a unity government between Likud and Blue and White.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s office called Mr. Gantz to arrange a meeting on Thursday in an admission that the premier couldn\u2019t establish the government of right-wing and religious parties that he had campaigned for.\n\n\u201cBenny, we must form a broad national unity government today,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement, addressing his rival. \u201cThe nation expects of us, from the two of us, that we\u2019ll be responsible and work together. Therefore we should meet today, at any hour, any time.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu made the statement during a moment of grave political and personal peril. If he isn\u2019t prime minister next month during a pre-trial hearing on bribery and fraud charges, he would likely have to resign from parliament if indicted. He denies the charges, and his allies had floated the idea of giving him immunity as prime minister.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s statement isn\u2019t a concession, however. He said his group of parties would go into coalition talks with Mr. Gantz as a group together. Likud and the other parties in the coalitions said they wouldn\u2019t join any government that doesn\u2019t include all of them.\n\nThat could pose a difficulty for talks. Avigdor Lieberman, the head of Yisrael Beiteinu, said he wouldn\u2019t sit with any religious parties. Mr. Gantz said on the campaign trail that he wouldn\u2019t sit in a government with Mr. Netanyahu while he is under investigation for alleged corruption.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was no choice but to form a unity government with his rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, after the country's election ended in a deadlock.", "authors": ["Felicia Schwartz", "Dov Lieber", "Felicia.Schwartz Wsj.Com", "Dov.Lieber Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108613/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
