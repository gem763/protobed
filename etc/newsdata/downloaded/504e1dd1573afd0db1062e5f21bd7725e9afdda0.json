The reality is that most of the best handling phases and chances to score tries will emanate from kicks, kick chases or kick pressure.\n\n\u2018If a team does not handle all the points around its kicking game and its kick defence then they will lose the territory battle, will come under pressure and almost certainly lose.\u2019\n\nMatt Dawson: Discipline is essential\n\n\u2018It starts with individual performance,\u2019 Dawson, the man who provided the pass from which Jonny Wilkinson kicked the drop goal that won England the 2003 World Cup, told the BBC.\n\n\u2018The front row, Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell are world class. Billy Vunipola, Ben Youngs, Manu Tuilagi and Elliot Daly must step up to that level. Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have got to obliterate the opposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And then England have got to assume that they make no mistakes at the weekend \u2013 no offsides, no penalties, nothing. They have got to play the perfect game.\u2019\n\nBrian Moore: Limit Beauden Barrett\u2019s running opportunities\n\nBeauden Barrett represents one of New Zealand\u2019s main dangermen with ball in hand (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018England have more ball carriers and more line breakers than even South Africa or Wales with their tenacity. I think that is in their favour, and if they do take chances they obviously have to take them.\n\n\u2018But this is the point for me and it has been hit and miss with England for a while, their kicking game has to be absolutely spot on.\n\n\u2018If you give their back field runners inspired by Barrett, you know you\u2019re talking no end of pace, but also intelligence, if your\u2019e not spot on with that then they\u2019ll cut you to shreds.\n\nPaul Grayson: Deal with Scott Barrett at the line-out\n\nScott Barrett represents a huge threat to England\u2019s potential line-out supremacy (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Picking Scott Barrett, a lock, at blind-side flanker is a huge call from Hansen \u2013 and a brilliant one potentially,\u2019 the former fly-half, third on the list of England\u2019s all-time points scorers, told the BBC.\n\n\u2018I did not even consider it but it is his tactical opener. England lock Courtney Lawes has now got a massive job on his hands.\n\n\u2018New Zealand have got four genuine line-out options: Barrett, Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock and Kieran Read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018England have got two options: Lawes and Maro Itoje \u2013 maybe two and a half because Tom Curry might be able to win a line-out.\n\n\u2018England have picked a team to play quick. But if you cannot win your set-piece and the All Blacks keep knocking the ball off the pitch then it is going to be really difficult.\u2019\n\nGeorge Chuter: Make it a physical battle\n\nSam Underhill and Mako Vunipola possess the physical power to unsettle New Zealand (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the same every time you play the all-blacks you\u2019ve got to be mistake free which is why it\u2019s so difficult to beat them,\u2019 said the former England hooker. \u2018To play someone for 80 minutes in test rugby and not make a mistake is tough.\n\n\u2018Some of the silly penalties that actually England seemed to have dried up in their quarter final, we can\u2019t have any of them.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t be having silly turnovers you have got to execute everything, and on top of that you have got to be quick and aggressive around the field.\n\n\u2018The teams that beat them, Ireland beat them recently, out-muscled them physically and got on top of them. And once you get on top of them you have to keep them down and really stick your foot on their neck.\u2019", "description": "England arrived in Yokohama in justifiably confident mood ahead of their Rugby World Cup semi-final against the All Blacks following last weekend's ultimately convincing win over Australia.
