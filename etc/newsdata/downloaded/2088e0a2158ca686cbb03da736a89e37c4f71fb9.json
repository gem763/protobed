It was heart-breaking,\u201d the 38-year-old dad told the Guardian.\n\nDoctors confirmed that Camre had lost all her memory from her childhood, including her wedding proposal and even her pregnancy. She also struggled to make new memories, Steve added.\n\n\u201cBut one exhausting day, six weeks after Gavin\u2019s birth, Camre looked at me on the sofa and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know who you are but I know I love you.\u2019 \u201d Steve described this as a turning for both of them and it inspired the title of his book.\n\nWith the help of occupational therapy and by continually repeating daily activities Camre has been able to relearn household tasks. But while her short-term memory now extends to three to four days her long-term memory remains wiped out.\n\nBut I Know I Love You, which is self-published, was released on the couple\u2019s four-year anniversary and follows the milestones they\u2019ve achieved together with their seven-year-old since his birth, GoodMoringAmerica reports.\n\nSources: People, Metro, Guardian, GoodMoringAmerica\n\n", "description": "His wife, Camre, suffered a life-threatening stroke during childbirth which resulted in her losing her memory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9538/5dece34ebe854c73aea7f4b9aef3dbc2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
