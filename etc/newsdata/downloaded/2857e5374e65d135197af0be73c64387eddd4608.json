In July, UC faculty members called on the university to divest its fossil fuel endowments.\n\nHowever, Bachher and Sherman said the decision to disinvest was based on financial rather than political or idealistic pressures.\n\nThe 10-campus system has been shedding fossil fuel investments for several years. It previously dumped several hundred million dollars\u2019 worth of investments in coal, tar sands and companies building a Dakota-to-Illinois oil pipeline.\n\nThe university, which has seen its investment assets grow to $126.1 billion, hasn\u2019t made any new investments in fossil fuels since 2014, the article said.\n\n\u201cWe have been looking years, decades and centuries ahead as we place our bets that clean energy will fuel the world\u2019s future. That means we believe there is money to be made,\u201d the article said. \u201cWe have chosen to invest for a better planet, and reap the financial rewards for UC.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The University of California is dumping fossil fuel investments from its pension and endowment funds, calling them a financial risk", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/university-of-california-fossil-fuel-investments.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
