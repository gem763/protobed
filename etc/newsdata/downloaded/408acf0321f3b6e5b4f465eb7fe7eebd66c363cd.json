Yato is also missing Fiji\u2019s second pool game on Wednesday against Uruguay. Hodge has a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nCheika regarded McKee as being insincere, and the Fijians\u2019 referral as going against \u201cthe spirit of rugby.\u201d\n\nMcKee, speaking in Kaaishi, said he\u2019d make only one comment so \u201cI won\u2019t get any more questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I think the World Rugby guidelines are quite clear around head injury assessment. Everyone is very well aware of the head injury framework and how they will be dealt with by the match officials and citing official,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process in the World Cup, it is the citing commissioner who cites people if they deem something could have been a red card offence and was missed on the field. In the citing official\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s a red card offence and it\u2019s up to Rugby Australia to argue whatever they wish, and for the judiciary to decide.\u201d\n\nMcKee said it was a big setback for Fiji to lose Yato.\n\n\u201cFrom our side, we lost a player who was nearly the most influential player on the park at that the time of the game for the rest of the game, and because of the head injury he can\u2019t play in this game either,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe Michael Cheika\u2019s views of what\u2019s within the spirit of the game are slightly different to some other people, but it\u2019s not up to me to decide what exactly he meant by that comment.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A day after Michael Cheika accused him of being two-faced, Fiji coach John McKee claimed not to know what his Australian counterpart meant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_59640_c0-121-2891-1806_s1770x1032.jpg?06869a14be0fc2ee8a69f81c9b8c5accdd673098", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
