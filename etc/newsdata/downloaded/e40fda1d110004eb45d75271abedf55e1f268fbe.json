A very soggy day for parts of Wales and also over the hills of northern England. That's an area for concern because we've seen a lot of wet weather recently.\n\n\"We do have a yellow warning in force for Friday.\"\n\nForecasters believe homes and businesses are likely to be flooded and public transport users will face delays as a result of the wet weather.\n\nSpeaking about tomorrow's conditions, a netweather.tv spokesman said: \"A wriggling frontal system will bring a band of cloud and rain southeastwards across England and Wales during Friday.\n\n\"Frequent showers across the north-west, some drier and sunnier conditions in between across northern England and eastern Scotland.\n\n\"Temperatures reaching 12-15C across Scotland and Northern Ireland, 15-18C across England and Wales.\"\n\nBrits will enjoy a bright start to the day this morning, although heavy rain is expected to follow in Scotland, Wales and north-west, central and south-west England.\n\nThundery showers are likely in north Wales and north-west England.\n\nThe rest of the country will experience cloudy conditions, with rainfall spreading across the whole of the UK overnight.\n\nTemperatures will peak at 16C and are expected to remain in the low teens for much of the country.\n\nMet Office five-day weather forecast\n\nToday:\n\nA good deal of dry and bright weather in the east, but cloudier in the west with some showers. More widespread areas of rain pushing across mainly western parts during the day. Windy.\n\nTonight:\n\nRain and showers affecting the UK, mainly western and southern parts with eastern areas seeing the best of the drier weather. Windy, perhaps with gales on west and south coasts.\n\nFriday:\n\nWet for many, particularly Wales and parts of northern England. Eastern Scotland and the far northeast of England most sheltered. Windy with gales for west and perhaps south coasts.\n\nOutlook for Saturday to Monday:\n\nUnsettled for most, with further spells of rain, heavy at times, particularly across some western areas. Windy too, with a risk of gales, particularly on Sunday.", "description": "The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Wales and parts of England, with forecasters expecting flooding", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549567.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Autumn-weather-Oct-6th-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
