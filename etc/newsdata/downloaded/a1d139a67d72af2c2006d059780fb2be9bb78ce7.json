Ditto those who voted Leave and have changed their minds, many of whom are members of the large and vocal Remainer community. Let\u2019s not forget, too, the democrats who, regardless of their own opinions on the subject, rightly reason that the British people ought to be given a final say, given that we\u2019ve gone from super special awesome deal to dismal May deal to a no deal that Boris Johnson and his chums said simply couldn\u2019t possibly happen.\n\nThe situation has deteriorated still further during the course of the current Tory leadership campaign. Contenders regularly, and without irony, talk about no deal and uniting the country in the same breath. That\u2019s right, the best way to \u201cbring people together\u201d is to wander off into a catastrophic fantasy land favoured only by a minority of screaming zealots, kicking everyone in the teeth in the process.\n\nThey all talk, like May did, about the need to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d for the \u201cBritish people\u201d, as if the country doesn\u2019t contain millions of people who think otherwise; as if those who believe they should have a say on what\u2019s being offered up simply don\u2019t exist.\n\nA Tory party engaged in a process of talking to itself needs to be reminded that they do, and forcefully. It also needs to be shaken into realising that there will be a price to pay if it rams something unpleasant down the public\u2019s throats.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a lot of marchers would be considered progressive; Liberal Democrats, the sensible part of the Labour Party, Greens, Scottish Nationalists and people uncommitted to one or other of them but who find themselves somewhere within that spectrum. But it also includes Tories such as Michael Heseltine, a far more substantial figure than any of those currently campaigning to become prime minister, and respected MPs such as Dominic Grieve, and Conservatives for a people\u2019s vote.\n\nDemonstrating the diversity of opinion opposed to the government\u2019s current course is just as important as demonstrating its strength in terms of numbers. It is necessary to put to bed the patronising and offensive claim that it\u2019s only a mythical north London liberal elite that thinks a no-deal Brexit is a thoroughly bad idea.\n\nThe march, and the planned series of rallies, can do that. The media wasn\u2019t able to ignore nearly a million people on the streets last time, and it won\u2019t be able to ignore it this time, however much certain Brexiteers would like it to.\n\nThat\u2019s why I will be hauling myself, wheelchair and all, across London with them.\n\nThe Conservative government needs to understand that there can be no \u201cmoving on\u201d by getting Brexit \u201cover the line\u201d unless the form of it is first endorsed by a popular mandate.\n\nI remember discussing Brexit with a French cameraman who filmed me for a piece on the impact of no deal on those of us who rely upon prescription drugs for our survival a while back.\n\n\u201cWhy are you not on the streets?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe would have been.\u201d", "description": "Can marches change anything?
