REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s struggling power utility Eskom said on Friday it was challenging in court the regulator\u2019s latest tariff decision, a move it said was necessary to avert financial disaster.\n\nState-owned Eskom, which produces more than 90% of the country\u2019s electricity, implemented some of most severe power cuts in several years this year and is reliant on government bailouts to survive.\n\nIn March, regulator Nersa granted Eskom tariff increases of 9.4%, 8.1% and 5.2% over the next three years, far below what the utility had sought. At the time Eskom said the tariff awards left it with a projected revenue shortfall of around 100 billion rand ($6.7 billion).\n\nEskom said in a statement on Friday its board of directors had decided to challenge the tariff awards after reviewing the reasons for Nersa\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe have put in an application for urgent interim relief, which is necessary to avoid financial disaster for Eskom. We are seeking an order to address this shortfall in a phased manner,\u201d Eskom Chief Financial Officer Calib Cassim was quoted as saying.\n\nIn arriving at its decision, Nersa had offset a 23 billion rand a year bailout granted by government against Eskom\u2019s allowable return on assets, Eskom said, arguing that approach ran counter to Nersa\u2019s own methodology and defeated the whole point of the bailout.\n\nEskom\u2019s finances are hobbled by its massive 450 billion rand debt burden, racked up partly to pay for two mammoth coal-fired power stations, Medupi and Kusile. But Eskom also argues its financial position has been severely damaged by years of low tariff awards which have not allowed it to recover its costs.\n\n($1 = 15.0061 rand)", "description": "South Africa's struggling power utility Eskom said on Friday it was challenging in court the regulator's latest tariff decision, a move it said was necessary to avert financial disaster.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439596764&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0KB-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
