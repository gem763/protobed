I smoked in a very particular way. Remember that \u2013 this is a big note \u2013 the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking.\u201d\u2018\n\nThe 53-year-old had previously opened up about how she found playing the princess a \u2018daunting\u2019 prospect, especially following Vanessa\u2019s footsteps.\n\nOlivia Colman and Tobias Menzies take over the leading roles in the new series of The Crown (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s daunting, definitely daunting. Vanessa has just won a Bafta and she\u2019s brilliant,\u2019 Helena said. \u2018And in a way you have the ghost of the real Margaret and the ghost of the actress who played her. You also have the fact everyone has an opinion about the woman and yet ultimately very few people knew what her private life was like and that\u2019s the sort of the joy of the job.\u2019\n\nSeason three of The Crown will drop on Netflix on November 17, and will see a complete overhaul of the show\u2019s major cast. Gone are Claire Foy and Matt Smith as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillp and in are newly-minted Oscar-winner Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen our first glimpse at Josh O\u2019Connor and Emma Corrin as Charles and Diana as the fourth season of the show is already filming. Sadly, those picketing for Helen Mirren to return to her role as The Queen for the show\u2019s latter seasons will be sorely disappointed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crown season 3 drops on Netflix November 17.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
