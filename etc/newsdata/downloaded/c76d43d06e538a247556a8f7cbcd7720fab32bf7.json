Dan Crenshaw dodging their questions, culminating in the Texas congressman \u201chiding in an elevator.\u201d This is the video they tweeted out:\n\nGOP Rep @DanCrenshawTX hid in an elevator today when combat vets confronted him about his support for Donald Trump. We\u2019re standing up for our democracy and holding Trump's cronies accountable.

Others, however, saw a different video:\n\nTalking to the guy badgering him and then following him into the elevator is a hell of a way to hide \u2014 Cameron Gray (@Cameron_Gray) September 20, 2019\n\n\u201cHid in an elevator\u201d after he walks a quarter mile with them\ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/CzB98DONzK \u2014 Jsutt (@Jsutt20) September 20, 2019\n\nThe video didn\u2019t really have a \u201chid\u201d feel.\n\nHe handled that remarkably well. https://t.co/oK81fI8zzx \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 20, 2019\n\n\"If you don't support impeachment, you're not doing your duty\" is a very odd definition of duty from veterans who should know better. https://t.co/du8K3d1dZE \u2014 Anthony Abides (@AnthonyAbides) September 20, 2019\n\nSo basically @DanCrenshawTX remained composed while you screamed at him, called into question his valor, and then posted the video for retweets? Got it. https://t.co/2n0OxyUVVG \u2014 Nicole Russell (@russell_nm) September 20, 2019\n\nThere's nothing about this video these activists should be proud of. They simply harassed a Congressman for 2 minutes. Veterans or not, completely classless. https://t.co/rRNTysIlIE \u2014 Fusilli Spock (@awstar11) September 20, 2019\n\nAnd the thoughts continued\u2026\n\nYou made him a campaign ad morons. https://t.co/9muIAwCoA9 \u2014 Aaron et politica ingenio \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@peekaso) September 20, 2019\n\nThank you for your service, and congratulations on your temper tantrum. \u2014 Hey, guys (@jtLOL) September 20, 2019\n\nYou ambushed him. You didn\u2019t present any facts. And you cowardly frame this video. \u2014 Rorschach (@TheWatchemen) September 20, 2019\n\nI\u2019m not impressed with your tactics.
