Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nTrump administration officials have blamed Iran for the attack on two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.\n\nGraham issued a statement Tuesday afternoon following a briefing from Vice President Pence on the attack, calling for decisive action and claiming Trump's response to Tehran's downing of a U.S. surveillance drone in June had been insufficient.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump had authorized a military strike on Iran in response to the downing of the drone but said he called it back after learning there would be 150 casualties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that such a sophisticated attack could not have occurred without Iran\u2019s blessing and direct involvement,\u201d Graham said of the attack on the oil sites.\n\n\u201cThis is literally an act of war and the goal should be to restore deterrence against Iranian aggression which has clearly been lost,\u201d Graham continued.\n\nGraham applauded the administration for creating a regional coalition and briefing Congress but criticized Trump\u2019s past response to drone incident for being insufficient.\n\n\u201cThe measured response by President Trump regarding the shooting down of an American drone was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness,\u201d Graham said, adding it was \u201cimperative\u201d that the U.S. take decisive action to deter further Iranian aggression.\n\nTrump on Monday responded to the attack by saying Iran was likely the culprit but that he was waiting on a final U.S. intelligence assessment. Trump also said he would like to avoid war with Tehran while simultaneously saying the U.S. is more prepared than any other nation for armed conflict.\n\nHis remarks suggested a softening of sorts, coming one day after the president said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d following the attack and awaiting final confirmation and direction from Saudi Arabia.\n\nStill, Trump and Graham, who is also up for reelection in 2020, are seen as close allies and often play golf together. They have clashed on foreign policy issues in the past, such as the president\u2019s effort to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan.\n\nPence echoed Trump\u2019s comments during a speech at the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday morning, saying the U.S. would like to avoid war but that the administration was prepared to take \u201cwhatever action is necessary\u201d to defend American allies.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of this unprovoked attack, I promise you, we\u2019re ready,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe\u2019re locked and loaded, and we\u2019re ready to defend the interests of our allies. Make no mistake about it.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is currently on a fundraising tour in California, has promised to release more details on the drone attack that shut down two major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Iran has denied responsibility. The Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Tehran, have claimed responsibility.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump fires back at Graham over Iran criticism Overnight Defense: GOP wary of action on Iran | Pence says US 'locked and loaded' to defend allies | Iran's leader rules out talks with US Republicans wary of US action on Iran MORE is currently traveling to Saudi Arabia to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the attack.\n\nThe two will \u201ccoordinate efforts to counter Iranian aggression in the region,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement Tuesday.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday night fired back at close ally Sen.
