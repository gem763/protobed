We\u2019re feeling a little red faced here after posting our skate park design,\u201d Tea Tree Gully City Council commented on the post.\n\n\u201cIn response to feedback, we\u2019ve changed the photo to one that more accurately reflects what people might expect to see from ground level,\u201d it said.\n\nThe post has amassed 72 comments and 9 shares in two hours, with a large majority of the commenters pointing out the humour of the one-balled dick park.\n\nHowever, other commenters were quick to point out that the skate park has always looked like a dick, and this is an upgrade from the sad looking dick-ramp that\u2019s currently on display.\n\nTea Tree Gully City Council is currently trying to choose between two possible skate park designs. One looks like a fun skate park for kids, the other looks like a giant raging cock. You can view the options and cast your vote here.\n\n\u201cWe would hate to set up false expectations \u2013 too much pressure for a skate park,\u201d the post read.\u201dWe thank the clever people of our community for their \u2018helpful\u2019 suggestions.\u201d\n\nThe local skate park is an integral part of the Tea Tree Gully community, with 58% of locals voting to upgrade the facility in a recent council.\n\nYou can expect to see the upgraded dick skate park up and running sometime in the 2020-2021 financial year.", "description": "A local Adelaide council has landed themselves in some hot water after sharing a proposed skate park that looks like a dick.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/eXk0InT-1024x576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
