And one of the most important steps to protecting the life of your hair color starts with your shampoo. \u201cShampoos for color-treated hair will ideally function in a few essential (and kind of obvious) ways,\u201d explains Brooke Jordan, co-owner and master stylist at the Bird House in Gowanus. \u201cFirst, they should moisturize but never strip color. Second, they should provide UV protection to help shield the color from the sun. And finally, they should ideally add in ingredients that are color-protecting or color-depositing.\u201d And when it comes to shampooing, Christine Thompson, master colorist and co-founder of Spoke & Weal, also has this essential tip: \u201cShampoo less.\u201d Water is the biggest hair-color aggressor, and will cause it to fade faster than any other factor. We asked Jordan, Thompson, and four other experts to find the best shampoos for a variety of color treatments, textures, and types. Below, their picks, which include shampoos for repairing heat-style damage as well as ones formulated for shades from platinum blonde to red.\n\nBest overall shampoo for color-treated hair\n\nOlaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo \u201cColor processing of any sort can damage the bonds of your hair,\u201d explains Blackstone NYC colorist Patti O\u2019Gara. \u201cThis sulfate-free shampoo will rebuild the bonds damaged through coloring, gradually transforming dry, broken, and brittle hair back to a healthier state.\u201d Fred Connors, the owner and creative director of FRED Salon, adds that this \u201cgame changer\u201d shampoo also \u201celiminates frizz.\u201d Both O\u2019Gara and Connors agree that, although this product was originally intended for bleached hair, Olaplex No. 4 is actually suitable for all hair types. It\u2019s especially for those who are dealing with hair that feels compromised by chemical processing, including those who have gone a nontraditional route with their hair dye. O\u2019Gara also recommends pairing this with the Olaplex No. 5 Bond Maintenance conditioner for an additional boost of repair. Olaplex was also a favorite of Rio\u2019s, who relied on the No. 3 treatment to keep her double-processed hair healthy and happy. $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest affordable shampoo for color-treated hair\n\nLove Beauty And Planet Blooming Color Shampoo $12 (was $14, now 14% off) For those looking to inexpensively maintain their color in between appointments, Connors recommends the Love Beauty and Planet Blooming Color Shampoo. \u201cThis shampoo is formulated like much more expensive designer brands with ethically sourced ingredients,\u201d including Bulgarian rose and Amazonian murumuru butter, which nourishes hair and gives loads of shine. It\u2019s also vegan, plant-based, and cruelty-free. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest color-safe shampoo for bleached blondes\n\n\n\n\n\nRahua Color Full Shampoo Blonde hair has a tendency to take on yellow or green tones over time. To protect blondes from getting brassy, Thompson\u2019s go-to is Rahua Color Full Shampoo, which deposits violet color into the hair\u2019s cuticle to counteract the brassiness. \u201cIt\u2019s the purple shampoo you have been looking for,\u201d she promises. The formula also gives a healthy lather that comes from a coconut oil surfactant rather than a detergent (which can be drying), \u201cso it\u2019s very gentle on the hair,\u201d adds Anessa Daviero of Headdress Hair Salon. The formula is also chemical-free and plant-based. $38 at Amazon Buy $38 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest color-safe shampoo for highlighted blondes\n\n\n\n\n\nKerastase Blond Absolu Bain Lumiere Shampoo $32 (was $33, now 3% off) \u201cThis super-lightweight formula detoxifies hair from pollution and removes dullness,\u201d says Connors, who adds that \u201cit\u2019s perfect for blondes with a bright, sun-kissed, highlighted look. It is also chock-full of antioxidants to prevent damage and protect hair. \u201cHighlights are instantly brighter and loaded with natural shine.\u201d $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest color-safe shampoo for balayage\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Mallett Shampoo No.2: Le Volume Gregorio Ruggeri of Salon Ruggeri loves this shampoo from David Mallett for clients who have had a balayage treatment, or are heavily highlighted, and need to add an extra dose of hydration after the extra stress of these particular services. \u201cThis whole range is as light as a feather but nourishes, heals, and revitalizes effectively.\u201d $45 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nBest color-safe shampoo for brunettes\n\n\n\n\n\nFanola No Orange Shampoo O\u2019Gara typically tells her clients to wash once a week with a toning shampoo, to \u201cstay ahead of the brass that will naturally set in as the oxidation process unfolds in between color services.\u201d She loves Fanola No Orange, a blue-pigmented shampoo for brunettes struggling with unwanted orange tones. \u201cOne to two applications should subtly tone the hair, extending the life of those pricey highlights,\u201d she adds. However, it\u2019s best to use such shampoos no more than once a week, as excessive use can not only dry the hair but cause an overload of purple or blue pigment within the hair, leaving the intended color looking drab. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest color-safe shampoo for redheads\n\n\n\n\n\nShu Uemura Color Lustre Shampoo \u201cThe most important thing for redheads is to ensure that the color pigment stays put and does not get washed out of the hair,\u201d which can happen with products that have too many sulfates or too many detergents, says Ruggeri. He likes Shu Uemura Color Lustre that is infused with musk rose oil and antioxidant-rich goji-berry extract to protect hair from fading. $47 at Amazon Buy $47 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest shampoo for color-treated dry hair\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving Proof Restore Shampoo O\u2019Gara calls this her \u201cgo-to for dry hair\u201d because it is formulated with a reparative compound that will \u201cmend your frizz, leaving hair soft, shiny, and healthy.\u201d And while Living Proof Restore Shampoo is sulfate-free \u2014 which typically is synonymous with suds-free \u2014 it will still \u201cwork up a nice lather\u201d for those who prefer the clean feeling that comes from a deeper cleansing. The formula is also cruelty-, SLS-, and silicone-free. $29 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest shampoo for color-treated oily hair\n\n\n\n\n\nSACHAJUAN Colour Protect Shampoo Sachajuan Colour Protect Shampoo can add serious shine to oily hair without weighing it down; the formula is designed to pump hair full of volume and nourishment. It\u2019s also a \u201csuper-gentle cleanser that does not strip color\u201d and is formulated with a UV protectant, says Jordan. $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest shampoo for color-treated fine hair\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Murphy Angel Rinse Connors suggests Kevin Murphy\u2019s Angel Wash for fine hair types because it contains green-tea extract, which \u201cincreases hair elasticity,\u201d and oat protein, which \u201cadds fullness while protecting color and giving fine hair body and shine.\u201d As an added plus, their packaging is made from recycled ocean-waste plastic making it good for both your hair and the earth, he says. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest shampoo for color-treated curly hair\n\n\n\n\n\nInnersense Organic Beauty Hydrating Hairbath For highly textured, curly, and coarse hair, Thompson suggests Innersense Hydrating Cream Hairbath. It contains a blend of coconut oil, shea butter, tamanu-seed oil, and jojoba oil to pump hair full of moisture, as well as sage and ylang-ylang essential oil to cleanse and balance the scalp. $33 at Amazon Buy $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest vegan shampoo for color-treated hair\n\n\n\n\n\nR+Co Gemstone Color Shampoo R+Co Gemstone Color Shampoo is a great vegan option that contains a color-protection complex, which, Jordan says, keeps color super vibrant. She calls it a \u201cvery high-tech color-protecting product\u201d that is highly moisturizing but also lightweight and is suitable for most hair textures. $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
