Why are they moving away?\u201d They were like \u201cDidn\u2019t you read episode 3?\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Because Joyce said she wanted to move away from Hawkins.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, I just felt really against it,\u2019 she continued. \u2018When we were filming it, all of us kids said to each other, \u201cSo how are we all going to cry?\u201d Because we don\u2019t really cry in front of each other very often. I usually am the one who\u2019s crying in every single scene and the kids have to deal with me listening to [sad] music and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh God.\u201d\n\n\u2018I thought, are we all going to go off and listen to music? And then one of the kids was like, \u201cImagine if we have to do this for real one day.\u201d And we were like, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d And they were like, \u201cWhat if, when Stranger Things is over, we\u2019ll all have to say goodbye to each other and like this is it.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMillie\u2019s pretty hyped for Stranger Things season 4 (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018And we all started crying and then they rolled camera and said action. And that was it. We all started saying goodbye to each other. We felt too real.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe teen entrepreneur, who launched her own production company alongside her sister Paige Brown last year, also revealed the Stranger Things 4 fan theory which has really \u2018freaked [her] out\u2019.\n\nAs for what\u2019s in store, she still has no idea. And it seems David Harbour is just as much in the dark as you or us as he called producers Ross and Matthew Duffer to ask: \u2018Is Hopper dead?\u2019\n\nTheir response? \u2018We\u2019re still figuring it out.\u2019 Great.\n\nOne Stranger Things fan, however, may have discovered Hopper\u2019s whereabouts even if the actual Duffer Brothers haven\u2019t quite got there yet.\n\nStranger Things seasons one to three are available to stream on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
