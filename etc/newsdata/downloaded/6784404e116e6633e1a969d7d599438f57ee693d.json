(NYSE: ) .\n\nDetails\n\nTotal US Rig Count Declines: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and in the United States totaled 904 in the week through Aug 30, lower than the prior-week count of 916.

Notably, the tally has never dropped to such a level since early January 2018. In the past nine weeks, drillers lowered the tally eight times. The current total, far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is also lower than 862 a year ago.\n\nNatural Gas Rig Count Flat in US: The natural gas rig count of 162 is in line with the prior-week count. However, the count of rigs exploring the commodity is lower than the prior-year week\u2019s 184.

While the tally of oil rigs in Permian fell for three consecutive weeks, DJ-Niobrara witnessed a drop in count for two successive weeks.\n\nInvestors should know that domestic drillers may continue to lower rigs in the oil patches as they have a conservative capital budget for 2019 and the crude pricing scenario is weak. Despite the bearish landscape, it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on Permian drillers which are ramping up crude production with the deployment of lesser rigs. Two Permian drillers that should be in investors\u2019 watch list are Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: ) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE: ) . Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
