Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\"\n\nTwitter's announcement comes as Facebook, a much larger rival and dominant player in digital advertising, faces a whirlwind of controversy over its own policies concerning political ads.\n\nThe controversy began earlier this month after Facebook declined to remove an ad from President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE's campaign attacking former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE, a top political rival, that multiple Democratic contenders noted contained ungrounded allegations.\n\nFacebook, though, says it will not fact-check political ads from public officials or candidates.\n\nRead more here.\n\n...ZUCKERBERG REACTS: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHillicon Valley: Amazon poised to escalate Pentagon 'war cloud' fight | FCC's move to target Huawei garners early praise | Facebook sues Israeli firm over alleged WhatsApp hack | Blue Dog Dems push election security funding Katie Pavlich: Liberals should celebrate Zuckerberg's efforts at tolerance San Francisco man launches gubernatorial candidacy to run false ads on Facebook about President Trump MORE on Wednesday ardently defended Facebook's controversial political advertising policy, just over an hour after Twitter announced it will ban all political ads from its platform.\n\nZuckerberg kicked off Facebook's quarterly earnings call by addressing the firestorm of criticism that his company has faced this month over its policy allowing politicians to lie in advertisements.\n\nJust before Facebook's earnings call, Dorsey hit Zuckerberg in his announcement that Twitter will no longer run any political advertising on its platform.\n\n\"Although I've considered whether we should not carry [political] ads in the past, and I'll continue to do so, on balance so far I've thought we should continue,\" Zuckerberg told investors.\n\n\"Ads can be an important part of voice -- especially for candidates and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so they can get their message into debates,\" he added.\n\nRead more here.\n\n...Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGeorge Papadopoulos launches campaign to run for Katie Hill's congressional seat Trump neck-and-neck with Biden, Warren, Sanders in Arizona: poll Tulsi Gabbard demands end to US aid to Saudi Arabia MORE REACTS: Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton doubled down Wednesday on her earlier criticism of Facebook's political ads policy after fellow social media giant Twitter announced that it would ban paid political advertising from its platform.\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday afternoon, Clinton appeared to dare Facebook executives to follow suit after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced the changes just minutes earlier.\n\nRead more here.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Clinton joined the ranks of Democrats in attacking what she called an \"appalling\" decision by Facebook to allow ads from politicians that contain proven falsehoods.\n\nIn a tweet, the former secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate accused Facebook of bearing responsibility for \"misinformation\" regularly being shared on the platform.\n\n\"Facebook's decision to allow false information in political advertisements is appalling. Voters are being confronted by millions of pieces of misinformation.

Technology - and social media especially - has a powerful responsibility in preserving the integrity of our elections. Not allowing for paid disinformation is one of the most basic, ethical decisions a company can make,\u201d the progressive lawmaker tweeted.\n\nRead more here.\n\n...AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN REACTS: President Trump's 2020 reelection campaign slammed Twitter on Wednesday over the company's decision to stop running political ads on its platform.\n\n\"Twitter just walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars of potential revenue, a very dumb decision for their stockholders,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale Bradley (Brad) James ParscaleMORE said in a statement.\n\n\"Will Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans?\" he added.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTHE RUSSIANS ARE BACK, PART ONE: Facebook on Wednesday announced that it had removed a wide-ranging Russian disinformation campaign targeting African countries, linking the network of fake accounts to a Russian oligarch previously indicted by the Justice Department for allegedly interfering in U.S. elections.\n\nThe social media giant unearthed the network of inauthentic pages and accounts with assistance from researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, who found that millions of users across African countries including the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were reached.\n\nFacebook said it removed 35 Facebook accounts, 53 pages, seven groups and five Instagram accounts that originated in Russia and targeted a broad swath of African countries.\n\n\"Our investigation connected these campaigns to entities associated with Russian financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who was previously indicted by the US Justice Department,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, head of Facebook's cybersecurity policy, wrote in a blog post. Prigozhin was indicted for allegedly helping to fund the Russian disinformation campaigns that targeted the U.S. presidential election around 2016.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTHE RUSSIANS ARE BACK, PART TWO: FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday testified that he expects Russian actors to attempt to interfere in the 2020 elections, adding that he also expects countries like China to explore disinformation efforts.\n\n\"Some of the things that the Russians have tried in other countries we expect them to try to do here as well, it's pretty common to test it out in other jurisdictions, thankfully we don't have elections every year, so that gives us a little bit of time to plan ahead,\" Wray testified in regards to potential attacks on U.S. elections to the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nWray did not offer details of what exactly the Russians might attempt due to the open setting of the hearing.\n\nWray noted that while the FBI has not seen \"any intention\" from China, Iran and North Korea to attempt attacks on election infrastructure, these countries are \"clearly interested in engaging in malign foreign influence\" in regards to elections, such as through social media disinformation efforts.\n\n\"They all have different ways of going about it, but they are all taking pages out of each others' playbooks, and as we project forward that is something that we have to be vigilant about,\" Wray said of the three countries.\n\nWray made these comments during a hearing on threats to the homeland, at which acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan also testified on potential election security threats.\n\nRead more here.\n\nBLOCKED: Senate Republicans blocked a sweeping House-passed election and ethics reform bill on Wednesday--the latest of several failed attempts by Democrats to clear election legislation ahead of 2020.\n\nDemocratic Sens.
