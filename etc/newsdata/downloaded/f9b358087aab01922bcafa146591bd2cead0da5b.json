Levi Strauss (ticker: LEVI) made its public debut in March, at $17 a share, and while it did jump to nearly $25 at one point, the stock has largely languished since. The shares dropped following its earnings report in July, and the company\u2019s most-recent results, from earlier this month, also sent Levi stock lower.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. On Tuesday, Macquarie analyst WerlsonHwang initiated coverage of Levi\u2019s with an Outperform rating and $23 price target, writing that he is upbeat about the company\u2019s strategy and ability to stay relevant with consumers. \u201cLevi\u2019s has always prided itself by being at the forefront of innovation. This is important, as research has shown that companies with higher R&D spend will outperform in the long term,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs such, innovation is one of the key tenets behind our Outperform thesis on Levi\u2019s.\u201d\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nHe also highlights the company\u2019s clean balance sheet\u2014which could facilitate cash returns to shareholders in the future in the form of dividends or share repurchases\u2014as well as a strong management roster.\n\nLooking ahead. Hwang sees more catalysts to come for Levi\u2019s especially as the company has \u201csignificant opportunity to diversify its revenue base by geography, by channel, and by gender\u201d (as men\u2019s clothing now accounts for nearly 70% of sales). He sees a core stable business and top-line acceleration for these underpenetrated markets driving results for the next few years.\n\nHe believes Levi\u2019s has an opportunity to expand gross margins as well, thanks to better sourcing and more lucrative offerings, like laser-finished jeans, while high fixed costs related to its direct-to-consumer investments should start to taper off. In addition, he likes that Levi\u2019s has embraced the resale market\u2014which is expected to double in the next five years\u2014via its partnership with Re/Done and the debut of the Authorized Vintage Program. \u201cThese initiatives may not directly impact the bottom line in a meaningful way, but they create a brand halo and bring other positive environmental, social, and governance related intangibles.\u201d\n\nLevi shares were up 3.9% to $17.69 late Tuesday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Macquarie thinks the denim and apparel maker has plenty of runway for growth and room to be generous with shareholders.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115228/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
