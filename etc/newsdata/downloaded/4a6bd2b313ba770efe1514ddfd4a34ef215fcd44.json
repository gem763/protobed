UBER 0.21% and Lyft Inc. LYFT 0.99% and food-delivery businesses like DoorDash Inc.\n\nNew York City earlier this year instituted a minimum wage for drivers of $17.22 an hour after expenses, among other regulations, the first in the country. There are efforts in several countries in Europe to reclassify drivers as employees, including the U.K., where an appeals court ruled in favor of employment status, pushing the final say to the top court.\n\nTaken together, the moves show that a decade after companies like Uber rocketed to popularity by offering low-cost, on-demand services, governments are pushing back, demanding many of the same labor protections and other regulatory requirements that the companies avoided in devising their business models.\n\nWhen Uber and other gig-based companies like TaskRabbit started, consumers were initially delighted by the convenience and novelty. Their employment model\u2014independent contractors aren\u2019t necessarily paid by the hour and don\u2019t have benefits like health insurance or unemployment insurance\u2014helped the companies stay nimble and undercut incumbents like taxis that can be burdened by city pay regulations. Workers could drop in and out as they liked, including squeezing in work between other jobs. But as the services have grown and become ubiquitous, complaints have proliferated.\n\nFor an increasing number of Americans, a patchwork of gig work is the norm. But nearly all face the challenges of inconsistent income and access to benefits.\n\nAt the moment when Big Tech began losing its luster in Washington, the novelty factor of the ride-hailing companies began to dissipate. Even as the services still enjoy broad popularity with consumers, constituent complaints in cities and states began piling up over some of their effects like congested streets and low driver pay.\n\n\u201cA lot of that shininess has worn off,\u201d said Meera Joshi, who headed the agency that regulates ride-hailing and taxis in New York City and oversaw the minimum-wage requirement for Uber and Lyft.\n\n\u201cYou see the same identical recurring issues around the world\u2014they\u2019re around congestion, driver pay, environmental impact,\u201d she added. \u201cIn New York, a lot of this happened quicker.\u201d\n\nGiven the growth of the sector\u2014Lyft alone has said more than two million people drove for it at some point in 2018, or more than 1% of the U.S. workforce\u2014other cities and states are expected to follow.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is not happening in a vacuum,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, a political consultant and venture capitalist whose Tusk Ventures was an early investor in Uber. \u201cThe politics in state government right now are trending left,\u201d a problem for the companies given that Democrats have been pushing added labor regulations on tech, he said.\n\nThe moves threaten to add significant costs for the gig economy, which extends beyond Uber and Lyft to a host of delivery companies like DoorDash and Instacart, whose delivery bikes and cars now dot urban streets around the globe. Almost none of these companies is profitable, and Uber and Lyft in particular haven't identified clear paths to profitability.\n\nTheir stocks have struggled since their market debuts this spring. Uber has fallen nearly 25% since its IPO, and Lyft is down around 35%. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate Uber and Lyft\u2019s California driver costs could go up 35%.\n\nThe companies have said that measures like California\u2019s aren\u2019t what most drivers want. Economics will force them to change their business models and decrease worker flexibility if drivers are classified as employees, they say.\n\nStill, both companies say they will continue to work with governments in the future. A Lyft spokesman said the company has long \u201cworked with regulators to find solutions that benefit drivers and riders and support innovation.\u201d\n\nThe New York regulation differs from that being discussed in California. Drivers are still independent contractors in New York, but make a minimum wage, and the number of cars is capped. As a result, the number of rides in the city recently began to fall, and companies have increased prices\u2014bringing them closer to taxi fares.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s bill, known as Assembly Bill 5, seeks to require that workers satisfying a number of conditions, including not setting their own wages, are classified as employees rather than independent contractors.\n\n\u201cPeople who work in these fields need to be protected,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the state assembly. \u201cIf it impacts their business model it\u2019s probably because they need to be paying their employees more.\u201d\n\nWith strong union support, the bill passed the legislature, and Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said he would sign it.\n\nUber, Lyft and other companies including DoorDash are still pushing for a deal that would exempt them\u2014one in which they would offer concessions like a benefits fund and a measure that gives drivers the ability to collectively negotiate with several employers.\n\nShould that fail, they plan to look to voters. The three companies promised earlier this month to spend at least $90 million combined to fund a ballot initiative to reverse the effects of the bill.\n\nThe effects of the bill once it becomes law are unclear. Lyft says far fewer drivers would be able to drive in California as it would need to have scheduled shifts to manage driver supply. Drivers wouldn\u2019t be able to toggle between apps\u2014a common practice\u2014and would instead be making an hourly minimum wage tied to one.\n\nBoth Lyft and Uber have said fares will go up for riders and wait times will increase.\n\nAfter the bill passed Wednesday, Uber immediately signaled defiance, saying it didn\u2019t plan to change its practices, because it believes the measure doesn\u2019t apply to its drivers\u2014a position it would likely fight in court. Tony West, Uber\u2019s general counsel, said Tuesday the company will \u201ccontinue to defend our ability to enable on-demand independent work.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alejandro Lazo contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com", "description": "A California bill passed this week is the latest move by regulators and courts around the globe that could curtail companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash.", "authors": ["Eliot Brown", "Eliot.Brown Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106641/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
