By how deep it runs.\n\nEnlarge this image V&A Images/Getty Images V&A Images/Getty Images\n\nThe women we have chosen to honor in this season of Turning the Tables can rightly be called fundamental to the sound and meaning of American popular music. As we chose our eight \u2014 Bessie Smith, Maybelle Carter, Billie Holiday, Marian Anderson, Ella Fitzgerald, Mary Lou Williams, Celia Cruz and Rosetta Tharpe \u2014 we invited a spirited debate about what that means. How do we decide what makes an artist great? Or makes her the greatest? What constitutes a meaningful legacy \u2014 and who gets to decide which legacies matter most?\n\nOne image these conversations inspired was of a musical, feminist Mt. Rushmore: Bessie Smith carved in stone next to Maybelle Carter (or Ma Rainey or Mahalia Jackson or Ruth Brown, or any of the other groundbreaking women whose names came up in our discussions). What would it mean to say these artists are monumental American figures at this scale: founders and originators whose work in the world forever changed history? Some answers might sound like this: \"In all probability there is not another artist on the stage who has more admirers than Bessie Smith, the crowned queen of blues, the greatest of them all,\" as the Chicago Defender published on Dec. 22, 1928. Or, \"She has become in her time the standard by which all of the rest of us are measured,\" as Peggy Lee said of Ella Fitzgerald at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1979, \"and that's as it should be.\"\n\nOf course, as some on our panel were quick to point out, the imagery of monuments is inherently hierarchical; it lifts up individual figures for their achievements as if they are lone actors whose greatness places them above their peers, foremothers and inheritors. But the importance of these artists can also be found in the connections they made. To build a bridge between genres (as Rosetta Tharpe did between the world of gospel and the emerging sound of rock and roll); between eras (as Mary Lou Williams did, effortlessly transitioning from stride to swing to bebop); between continents (like Celia Cruz combining African rhythms and American influences): This, too, illustrates their greatness. These artists' work resonates across time, embraced by each generation of artists that has come after them. At his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 1992, Johnny Cash said some of his earliest songs \"were influenced by people like Sister Rosetta Tharpe.\" \"Ella was the first singer I heard growing up that made me realize what greatness is,\" jazz and soul singer Kandace Springs told us. \"I still listen to her versions of songs to know what to aim for.\" Our image changed then, to a mother lode: a central vein that uncovers an overwhelming inheritance.\n\nThe collection of quotations below proves how the greatness of these artists cannot be contained within a single definition. To create it, we read historical accounts of these artists' lives, looked to their influence across popular culture and reached out to contemporary artists who feel a connection to our eight. Through glowing reviews of these artist's early performances and contemporary testimonies about their lasting impact, from heartfelt remembrances to poetry in their honor to video footage of musical tributes, we invite you to celebrate, re-examine and redefine the legacies of these eight women who invented American popular music. \u2014Marissa Lorusso\n\nListen to a playlist of songs by the eight women who invented American popular music on Spotify or Apple Music.\n\nGreatness in their time\n\n\"In the music, in [Billie Holiday's] phrasing, her timing, the timbre of her voice, the social roots of pain and despair in women's emotional lives are given a lyrical legibility.\" (Blues Legacies and Black Feminism: Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday, Angela Davis, 1998)\n\n***\n\n\"She functioned as a fountainhead not only of blues phrasing style but of jazz vocal instrumental arranging and popular music vocal style as well. Literally thousands of jazz and pop singers, black and white, have been in her debt since her death, but by today few are aware of the roots of their style. ... Bessie's magic was that she could bring to the listener the intimacy of the country blues while projecting with perfect musicianship and imagination the worldly qualities of the new. ... As kind as she was tough, as country as she was worldly, Bessie Smith brought to her work a musicianship touched by genius. Viewed but dimly through the imperfect medium of early 78 r.p.m. recordings, and supported in an early-jazz accompaniment style that was itself just a-borning, the art of Bessie Smith nonetheless stands as one of the landmarks of musical history.\" (\"Blues and Bessie Smith,\" Carman Moore; New York Times, March 9, 1969)\n\n***\n\n\"In all probability there is not another artist on the stage who has more admirers than Bessie Smith, the crowned queen of blues, the greatest of them all.\" (Chicago Defender, Dec. 22, 1928)\n\n***\n\n\"Nobody \u2013 not Chuck Berry, not Scotty Moore, not James Burton, not Keith Richards \u2013 played wilder or more primal rock'n'roll guitar than this woman who gave her life to God and would have celebrated her 100th birthday on 20 March [2015].

Maybelle's cousin Sara had a remarkable voice, and Sara's husband A.P. Carter had a talent for collecting songs, but I think Maybelle's guitar playing had as great an influence on American music as the Carter Family's enduring songs. She had developed her style on her own, picking the melody with her thumb while simultaneously strumming the rhythm and chords with her other fingers \u2014 called 'the Carter scratch.' It became one of the most-copied guitar styles in music history (Duane Allman taught \"Wildwood Flower\" to his wife). 'There's rhythm and there's the melody,' Vince Gill told us for our documentary film, 'and at its simplest place, it still carries maybe the most poetry. Mother Maybelle as a guitarist may be the most iconic instrumentalist that we've ever had.'\n\nAnd after the original Carter Family disbanded, she extended her legacy even further, performing with her three daughters as The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle. In the 1940s, they were responsible for bringing the young Chet Atkins to Nashville, which in itself was a great contribution to the music's history. In the early 1950s, Maybelle helped Hank Williams through some of his darkest hours with some late-night stew and motherly conversation, and would later do the same for Johnny Cash (who ended up marrying Maybelle's middle daughter, June, in 1968). Then, in the early 1970s, she participated in the landmark triple-disc album Will the Circle Be Unbroken with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, a hippie band from California, creating something that brought old-time country music to a whole next generation. That's quite a legacy.\" \u2014Ken Burns, documentary filmmaker\n\n***\n\n\"In a sense, there were two Marian Andersons.

Rosetta's singing brings memories of hot afternoon gospel sings, where I watched as the spirit overtook people and prayed that God would send a breeze through the open church windows. Each sung note and guitar lick told the stories of those seeking transcendence from earthly problems.

Her legacy means so much to me because without her, there would be no me.\" \u2014Karen Slack\n\n***\n\n\"When I was a kid \u2014 about 11 or 12 \u2014 I was hanging out with Ella Fitzgerald in her dressing room before her show at Symphony Hall in Boston. I told her how I had seen her recently on the Grammys with three other singers and when she started scatting, she 'dusted' the others. She said, 'Oh no, they are real singers. I'm just a rhythm singer.'\n\nFor many years, I didn't understood that comment. I didn't see how she could reduce herself to being 'just a rhythm singer.' For most of us, she was so much more. But in recent years, I have focused more on her incredible rhythmic ability and I see that she was pointing to her strongest attribute. Her time was impeccable. And certainly there was no faltering with clarity of note and pitch either, but it is the complexity of the rhythm that makes jazz music as special as it is \u2014 it's the way it feels based on the execution of rhythm, something that connects heavily with African tradition. And though technical virtuosity is ever-present as well, it is the 'swing' aspect that you connect with the most, tapping your foot or dancing or any other way one gets with 'the groove' while listening.\n\nElla's experience singing beside the best of the jazz horn players helped her ability to sing as they played, which makes me think that if she had played an instrument, she would have been just as good at that as she was 'scatting' or improvising like a horn. But women were not encouraged to play horns when she entered on the jazz scene, not in the same way men were. There was a pervasive narrative that men play the music and women sing it, still Ella disrupted that narrative with how she sang \u2014 more like an instrumentalist, becoming a trailblazer and setting the standard that others were held up to. And to this day, it can be argued that there has not been anyone that could 'dust' Ella when it comes to scatting.\" \u2014Terri Lyne Carrington, musician & Turning the Tables panelist\n\n***\n\n\"From her, I learned to bring everything I had onto the stage with me.

The fans were a priority for her \u2014 never let them down and always show up!\n\nShe taught me bits and pieces of how to play, but mostly I watched her in her humble, graceful way be completely authentic and never try to be anything other than herself. My grandmother's music always felt like the most natural thing for me to sing and play, and touches a place in my heart that feels like home and feels spiritual at the same time. Whenever I am at a loss as to what to do musically in my career, I have always gone back to that place that made me: music from the heart, Appalachian pride all of us Carters share!

The performance was 'High How the Moon' from the [Ella In Berlin] album. I can remember it like yesterday, because it remains one of my favorite Ella performances. As she worked through the intricate vocal improvisation that consisted of multiple musical quotations, I was captivated. I had never heard anything like it. The way the musicians followed her lead totally redefined what I thought about in terms of jazz performance. Ella personified for me \u2014 a young, black woman trying to find herself in a space that often silence her voice and made her invisible \u2014 the embodiment of freedom. I thought then and even more so now: This is what freedom sounds like. When I saw pictures of her, I thought, 'This is what freedom looks like.' She was curvy and sophisticated! She was Ella \u2014 Not Billie! Not Dinah! Not Sarah! Not a template, but her own self!

I never got to see her perform live but heard of her when I was still residing in Brazil.

She was certainly a pioneer and an important voice for jazz and women.\" \u2014Eliane Elias\n\n***\n\n\"Mary Lou Williams was an undeniable genius in the jazz world during a time when American society was not calling jazz musicians (male or female) 'genius,' but the term was especially not reserved for women. She accomplished more than most artists of her time, regardless of gender. Her writing and arranging alone would have made for an extraordinary career. And her piano playing alone would have as well. But together, she made a miraculous and pioneering contribution to the music. For her to accomplish all of this as a woman in a patriarchal society makes it even more impressive. The obstacles of race and gender combined are difficult to navigate in present day, so we can imagine how it was for her then. Though she may not have identified as feminist, especially during a time where feminism as a term was not as popular in her community, she led by example. And for all female jazz artists and composers, she left broad shoulders to stand on. I can't think of any other person whose artistry spanned masterfully through as many jazz subgenres as her: from stride and boogie woogie to bebop and the avant-garde. I'm so happy I had the pleasure of meeting her when I was young, as she is one of my inspirations \u2014 an unparalleled heroine.\" \u2014Terri Lyne Carrington, musician & Turning the Tables panelist\n\n***\n\n\"As a pianist, I was searching for an identity in a music that went beyond the classical repertory. The first time I heard Mary Lou Williams play 'Night Life,' I thought, 'What the hell! Who is the hell is this?' I had never heard so much music come from a piano! I had never heard such power, such creativity, such freedom! That experience completely changed the trajectory of my life. I not only totally changed the scope of my graduate study and began researching everything I could about Mary Lou Williams, I also started experimenting with playing jazz. I secretly took jazz piano for a semester with legendary pianist/organist Hank Marr. That experience untapped a connection to black music that no one had ever urged me consider. My connection with Mary Lou lead me to other female pianists like Hazel Scott and Marian McPartland. There was so much in Mary Lou's story that I could relate to; so much I heard in her music that went beyond notes and riffs! She and Ella articulated for me in a real way the artistry that black women bring to whatever they do. They totally destroyed the canonical model of the 'great man' for me!\" \u2014Tammy Kernodle, professor, Miami University & Turning the Tables panelist\n\n***\n\n\"In some cultures, there is no word for music, because it embodies the entirety of life. It is not something that is distinguished from life as a separate expression. This is Billie Holiday. Every note is life. We are a culture that analyzes everything to deem it valid or to place a value on it. In an effort to not participate in that way, I will say no more about Billie Holiday, because her ability to be one with art, to merge her life with her artistry, says it all.\" \u2014Terri Lyne Carrington, musician & Turning the Tables panelist\n\n***\n\n\"I first heard about Mary Lou Williams when I was a teenager; I had heard a few of her recordings thanks to my parent's jazz record collection. I liked the energy in her sound and the fluidity of her improvisation. I became aware of the breadth and depth of her compositions, and as I saw only a small handful of women instrumentalists, she made an impression on me.\n\nI met Mary Lou Williams in Monterey California in the early 1970s . I was there as a student participating in the summer high school band that would play at the famous Monterey Jazz Festival. Mary Lou was a clinician and performer that year. She showed me a finger exercise that I use to this day. The energy and spirit of her music-making was still there alongside a quiet and regal presence. I'll always remember that.\" \u2014Patrice Rushen\n\n***\n\n\"I felt immediately that [Mary Lou Williams] was an important influence, because she was always such an innovator. She kept moving along with the time; that's what I liked about her most of all.\" \u2014Marian McPartland (Los Angeles Times, June 7, 1981)\n\n***\n\n\"Billie Holiday was ahead of her time. Besides Louis Armstrong and Nat 'King' Cole, I can't think of another jazz vocalist who composed songs on the level that she did. 'God Bless the Child' is a masterpiece. And her groundbreaking concept as lead vocalist/bandleader singing as a horn has been the model for every serious jazz singer since: Ella, Sarah, Betty Carter, Carmen McRae, Kurt Elling and Cassandra Wilson.\" \u2013Jos\u00e9 James\n\n***\n\n\"There, I heard some of my earliest heroes. It was at the Home of the Blues record shop where I bought my first recording of Sister Rosetta Tharpe singing those great gospel songs. I can still see Sister Rosetta playing that Stella guitar ... Some of the earlier songs I wrote were influenced by people like Sister Rosetta Tharpe.\" \u2014Johnny Cash at his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, 1992\n\n***\n\n\"Sister Rosetta Tharpe is someone I admire greatly. I learned about her when I was younger at Rock 'n' Roll Camp for Girls in a history of women in music class. She's always been someone who I think about as the creator of rock and roll, and to know that a black woman has shredded her way for others is super empowering to many, including me!\" \u2014Black Belt Eagle Scout\n\n***\n\n\"It is impossible to overestimate the impact of Bessie Smith on the history of modern music. For sheer power and emotion, she remains one of the greatest blues singers of all time, and is still influencing blues and jazz artists today.\" \u2014Bonnie Raitt\n\nAdditional reporting by Rosalind Faulkner", "description": "A collection of glowing reviews, heartfelt remembrances, poems and tributes in celebration of the legacies of the eight women we're honoring in the third season of Turning the Tables.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/07/30/gettyimages-112059122_wide-b9cb38f4b505e3a885962dcefaae71eb0e304325.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
