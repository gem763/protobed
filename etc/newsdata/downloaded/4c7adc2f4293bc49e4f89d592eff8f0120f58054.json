But the venue for the COP25 conference is in the air, meanwhile, as Chile on Wednesday told the UN it cannot host due to political unrest.\n\nDigging into the wider implications of climate losses is important now - as they have started to surge, Warner said.\n\nFrom small islands facing a decline in tourism as coral reefs deteriorate, to Germany seeing its famed forests die off, \"we are talking about profound change,\" she noted.", "description": "UN official: With the planet heating up fast, so-called  'worthy' global goals may no longer be the best focus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/274896fcb46941368327001974984ecd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
