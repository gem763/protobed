The majority of it is domestic \u2013 shuffling between Sydney and Melbourne, where Sensis is headquartered, with a few Perth, Brisbane, Cairns and Townsville trips thrown in for good measure.\n\nI also travel to London, New York and Los Angeles a fair bit for work. For leisure, I go to Mykonos every year and Bali for a short break.\n\nWhat are your preferred airlines and your top frequent flyer loyalty cards?\n\nOneworld member airlines, including Qantas; I also fly Singapore Airlines when in Asia. I've got more than 600,000 points with Qantas Chairman\u2019s, and 110,000 points across Velocity and KrisFlyer combined. Qantas \u201cgets\u201d lounges \u2013 the right mix of privacy, practicality and service; its design feels special. The new Brisbane Chairman\u2019s club is practical and sumptuous.\n\nWhere was your last trip?\n\nMy last trip was to Los Angeles. Most of my meetings were in Beverly Hills so I stayed at the London West Hollywood. The rooms are large, nicely appointed and well priced, and the lobby is a hive of activity with young professionals and movie types. It also has a great rooftop pool \u2013 the ideal place for a dip before catching QF12 home late to Australia. Eating in LA can be hit and miss. My favourite restaurant is E.P. & L.P. in West Hollywood. It serves great Asian food, and is owned by Aussie DJ Grant Smillie.\n\nWhat's your top business travel tip?\n\nTravel with a light, short-sleeved V-neck T-shirt in your hand luggage for a long-haul flight. The pyjama tops provided by airlines are usually long sleeved, tight around the neck and get too warm. I prefer a black H &M tee as it matches all airline pyjama bottoms and is easy to hand wash for the return trip.", "description": "As Sensis CEO, John Allan is\u00a0often up in the air, but he says with the right gadgets, the time also flies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0171%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_164%2C$y_326/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/74d886602efad09aec1394834ab5f4c236042c37", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
