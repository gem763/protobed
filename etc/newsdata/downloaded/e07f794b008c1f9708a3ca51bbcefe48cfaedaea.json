REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has slashed interest rates by 75 basis points since June to 0.75%, leaving little room for more reductions and raising the possibility of unconventional policy easing.\n\nYet, there are little signs of progress in boosting consumption, employment or inflation, with the country\u2019s housing market the only sector showing signs of a revival.\n\n\u201cThe resilience of Australia\u2019s financial system has steadily improved over recent times,\u201d RBA Governor Philip Lowe said in a speech in Melbourne. \u201cLending standards have also been strengthened, although in some areas the pendulum may have swung a bit too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cLenders should not be so scared of making a loan that goes bad that they don\u2019t provide the credit that the economy needs.\u201d\n\nFinancial futures <0#YIB:> imply a near 60% chance the RBA will cut rates again to 0.5% next month.\n\nOne risk is that further cuts to interest rates would fuel a debt binge in property sector when the household debt-to-income ratio in Australia is already at a record peak of 190%.\n\nBut the country\u2019s household sector had also built up substantial buffers at an aggregate level, Lowe said foreshadowing the RBA\u2019s six-monthly Financial Stability Review ahead of its scheduled release on Friday.\n\nThe RBA estimates that around a quarter of households with a mortgage have either no buffer or a very small one. Further, for almost 4% of borrowers their current loan balance exceeded their property value and over half of them were in Western Australia.\n\n\u201cSo this is an area that bears watching,\u201d Lowe noted.\n\nOn other threats to financial stability, the RBA board also talked about the possibility that a shock somewhere in the global system could lead to a \u201cdisruptive\u201d repricing of risks, he said.\n\nThe Board discussed how the Australian economy appears to have reached a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d with low interest rates, government tax rebates, infrastructure spending, housing market stabilization supporting the outlook.\n\n\u201cThe economy has been through a soft patch recently, but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year,\u201d he said.\n\nLowe said the RBA was seeking to make more \u201cassured progress\u201d toward both full employment and its 2% to 3% inflation target which has eluded it for more than three years.\n\n\u201cWe still expect to make progress on both fronts, but that progress is slower than we would like. Today\u2019s decision will help,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nHe listed geopolitical uncertainties led by the U.S.-China trade and technology disputes as well as a global trend toward lower interest rates among other reasons to keep policy accommodative in Australia.\n\n\u201cAs a central bank in a small open economy we have to take the world as we find it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile we might wish it were otherwise, we can\u2019t ignore these global trends and their impact on our economy. So, the Board is watching these global developments.\u201d", "description": "The head of Australia's central bank on Tuesday urged lenders to improve credit supply to the economy, hours after cutting its cash rate to a historic low, saying lending standards have been tightened too far in some cases.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435827679&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902EJ", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
