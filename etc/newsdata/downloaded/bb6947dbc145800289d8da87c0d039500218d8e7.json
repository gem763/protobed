Gavin Newsom signed a statewide rent control provision into law this week, which some experts warn could exacerbate the problem.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nProponents hope the measure will prevent lower-income Americans from being priced out of their homes, while keeping rents affordable overall.\n\nHowever, critics say it will discourage investment and building, thereby compounding an existing inventory crunch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to make things worse,\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute's director of health policy studies, told FOX Business. \u201c[Rent control] clearly discourages the construction of housing.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s housing problem has been caused at least in part by a slowdown in construction: During the first half of 2019, there was a \u201csubstantial decline\u201d in the number of new housing units authorized by building permits, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nAccording to state officials, production has averaged less than 80,000 new homes per year over the past decade \u2013 and production continues to trend \u201cfar below\u201d projected needs \u2013 of 180,000 additional homes each year.\n\nCalifornia Republican Rep. Tom McClintock told FOX Business on Wednesday that the state has been 3.5 million units short of meeting demand over the past 15 years.\n\n\u201cBefore you can stick a shovel in the ground, you\u2019re charged $150,000 [worth] of fees,\u201d McClintock said during an interview with FOX Business\u2019 David Asman.\n\nCritics argue that rent control measures do not address the underlying factors that have caused the housing problems in the first place.\n\nNational Association of Home Builders (NAHB) CEO Jerry Howard previously told FOX Business the policy was like a \u201cshort-term Band-Aid\u201d that makes the \u201clong-term problem even worse.\u201d\n\nThe bright spot? Cannon noted that the rent controls are relatively weak, so the impact will be modest.\n\nInstead of implementing rent control, the government should focus on making it easier to build affordable housing \u2013 dealing with zoning and the secondary review approval process, Cannon said.\n\nNewsom signed the law on Tuesday. It limits year over year increases to 5 percent, plus inflation, through 2029.\n\nThe law is set to go into effect on Jan. 1, but will retroactively apply to rent increases on or after March 15 in order to prevent landlords from preemptively hiking prices.\n\nHomelessness in Los Angeles increased 12 percent in the year that ended in June. California has more people living on the street than any other state.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nCalifornia is not the only area facing an affordable housing crisis turning to rent control as a solution. New York City lawmakers approved new rent control protections earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Oregon passed the first statewide rent control measure in February \u2013 limiting increases to 7 percent annually, plus inflation.", "description": "Critics say policy is a short-term solution that will make the problem worse over the long-term.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/golden-gate-bridge-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
