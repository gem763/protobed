Neither he nor Ms Arcuri have responded to claims that she told friends at the time that they were in an intimate relationship.\n\nSpeaking after the 6pm deadline passed, Mr Duvall said: \u201cIt is very disappointing that we have not received a response from the prime minister. Missing the deadline of a polite request to fully cooperate is unhelpful and this already serious situation has now become grave. The allegations of potential misuse of taxpayers\u2019 money are no laughing matter. We will be taking this further.\n\n\u201cThere are now a range of options available to us. Next week, the Oversight Committee will meet to discuss those options and decide on its next course of action.\n\n\u201cYou can be assured that the London Assembly will investigate this matter with absolute commitment.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But the GLA said that, as well as the address at No 10, it was also sent to Mr Johnson\u2019s constituency office, from which a notice of receipt had been sent.\n\nThe GLA\u2019s monitoring officer has already reported Mr Johnson to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for possible investigation over misconduct in public office.\n\nThe reference to the IOPC said that Ms Arcuri\u2019s company Innotech received \u00a311,500 from the mayor\u2019s promotional agency London & Partners for two events in 2013 and 2014. It added that Ms Arcuri was able in November 2014 to attend a trade mission to Singapore and Malaysia through another company called Playbox, even though an initial application through Innotech had been declined.\n\nAnd it said she was allowed to participate in events around trade missions to New York and Israel in 2015, even though she had not qualified for the New York mission and had been rejected for the mission to Israel.", "description": "Prime minister Boris Johnson has missed a deadline to hand over information about his relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, the Greater London Assembly has said.
