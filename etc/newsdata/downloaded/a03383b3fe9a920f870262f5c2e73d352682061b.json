(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is a place not far from Washington where people gather to settle scores, but not in the way you might think.\n\nThey can be found on a grassy lot more than an hour and a half from the nation\u2019s capital. If you arrive at the right time on the right weekend each month, you\u2019ll find a group of people who say they have found a way to fight gun violence that has nothing to do with studies, laws or protests.\n\nTheir solution, they will tell you, is much simpler: Let two people with a grudge pummel each other.\n\n\u201cI know that it probably sounds ridiculous from the outside,\u201d Chris Wilmore says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. But I can tell you that I have solved beefs with guys I hated before I fought them, and now we talk regularly.\u201d\n\nWilmore, who is called \u201cScarface,\u201d and sometimes just \u201cFace,\u201d created the fight club Streetbeefs in his Harrisonburg, Va., backyard in 2008. His goal at the time was to provide a safe place for people in his community to settle disputes. Like him, many of the club\u2019s first members had criminal records and were aware of what could happen if they took their fights to the streets. The club\u2019s motto is \u201cGuns down, gloves up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone dying, and we don\u2019t want anyone going to jail,\u201d Wilmore says. \u201cWhat we do is make them give their word that if this fight doesn\u2019t solve it, they have to come back.\u201d\n\nHe says he has seen men fight over borrowed money that wasn\u2019t paid back, a lent car that was returned damaged, a woman, a tree stand, a tip given to a probation officer about someone\u2019s marijuana habit. One dispute got so out of hand, he says, that the men tried to run each other off the road.\n\n\u201cI was stabbed in my throat in a street dispute years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cYou may think your dispute is petty. I\u2019ve seen people die over petty.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the club has grown in popularity. People in other states and countries watch videos of its fights, and sometimes they come to participate.\n\nOn a recent weekend, men traveled from California, Oklahoma and the Netherlands to gather in the bare-bones backyard of one of Wilmore\u2019s friends. There, they stepped into a ring made from a chain-link fence and black-painted plywood bearing the scrawled names of other fighters: Iraqi Assassin, Russian Bear, Vandal.\n\nRead the full story here: \u201cFor 8 years, he held a grudge.
