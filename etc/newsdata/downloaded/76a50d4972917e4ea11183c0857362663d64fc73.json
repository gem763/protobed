In his defense, the father argued that he was administering \u201cmoderate and reasonable chastisement\u201d previously allowed under common law. However, the Constitutional Court unanimously upheld the 2017 ruling, stating that that were effective ways of disciplining a child without resorting to corporal punishment.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability of children, their rights to dignity and to have the paramountcy of their best interests upheld, as well as the availability of less restrictive means to achieve discipline, render moderate and reasonable chastisement unconstitutional,\u201d the court wrote in its ruling.\n\nThe High Court had previously ruled that spanking amounted to a violation of children\u2019s rights, arguing that protection from all forms of violence was absolutely critical in the context of alarmingly high levels of child abuse across South Africa. The initial ruling also argued that the case was about providing children with \u201cequal protection of the law, dignity, freedom from all forms of violence and degradation, bodily and psychological integrity, and the child\u2019s right not to be discriminated against based on age.\u201d\n\nFORSA demanded the ruling be overturned, arguing that there is an obvious distinction between \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d chastisement and unabated child abuse and that parents maintained the right to decide what was best for their children. In a statement, they said they were acting on behalf of the public interest and those who \u201cbelieve that the scriptures and other holy writings permit, if not command, reasonable and appropriate correction of their children.\u201d\n\nTheir position was opposed by various civil society groups, including the Children\u2019s Institute, the Quaker Peace Centre and Sonke Gender Justice, who stated in written submissions that \u201cpositive parenting\u201d was the solution to bad or disruptive behavior.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to develop an ethos or inner conviction in the child that will ensure that they will behave well, even when their parents are not present,\u201d they said in a written submission. \u201cIt builds feelings of confidence and assertiveness rather than feelings of helplessness and humiliation.\u201d\n\nSuch opposition was also backed by the government, who said that children should be protected from all types of violence. \u201cAny act that harms a child\u2019s right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation is unlawful and unconstitutional,\u201d said Nkosinathi Dladla, legal services director in the social development department.\n\nThe ruling now paves the way for South African parliament to draw up legislation formally criminalizing the use of physical force against children.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The Constitutional Court of South Africa upheld the ruling by a lower court that effectively outlawed spanking children.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-454746027-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
