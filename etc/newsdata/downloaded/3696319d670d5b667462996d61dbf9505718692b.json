Schiff said Sunday that his panel has reached an agreement to secure testimony from the anonymous whistleblower whose detailed complaint launched an impeachment investigation last week into President Trump.\n\nSchiff (D-Calif.) said he expected the Intelligence Committee to hear from the whistleblower \u201cvery soon\u201d pending a security clearance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d Schiff said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d noting that Maguire said in a hearing Thursday that he would allow the whistleblower to testify privately without constraints.\n\nThe whistleblower kicked off the impeachment saga that came to a head with Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement Tuesday of an \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry.\u201d In that nine-page Aug. 12 complaint filed with the inspector general of the intelligence community, the whistleblower accused Trump of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\u201d \u2014 in particular, through a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n[\u2018The president of the United States is the whistleblower,\u2019 Stephen Miller says]\n\nThe identity of the whistleblower has been closely guarded, though The Washington Post and other news outlets have identified him as a male CIA officer. Schiff said Sunday that members of his committee were \u201ctaking all the precautions we can . . . to go forward in a way to protect the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nNumerous Republicans have attacked the whistleblower complaint as \u201chearsay,\u201d noting that the information contained in it came from secondhand sources.\n\nSchiff said Sunday that does not make the complaint less credible because key allegations in it were confirmed by a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call as well as other sources.\n\n\u201cThis whistleblower has already been substantially corroborated, which suggests that other information that he or she provides in that complaint likewise may be subject to corroboration,\u201d he said. \u201cSo do not dismiss both the professionalism of this whistleblower, and \u2014 and this is what we would expect of someone who comes out of the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nSchiff declined to say whether he knew of other whistleblowers who have come forward in recent days but encouraged any officials with information about the allegations to step up.\n\n\u201cWe are dependent on people of good conscience coming forward, particularly now, given that we have such an unscrupulous president,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Rep.
