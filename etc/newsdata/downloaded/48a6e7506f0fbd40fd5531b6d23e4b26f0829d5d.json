I believe that a smartphone too accessible, given too early, and in the wrong hands is at best an addictive distraction and at worst a handheld siphon draining away children\u2019s youth one beep, one swipe, one notification at a time.\n\nThe smartphone delay in our house started long before the devices were as prevalent as they are today, and at the time it was more an omission than an act of resistance. When our boys were babies and toddlers, we heeded the advice of pediatricians and child-development experts who warned against too much TV for young children. We watched the PBS morning lineup and Disney movies, but that was the extent of our screen time. Then, in 2009, when my oldest was 5, my dad gave us a book by Richard Louv called Last Child in the Woods. The thesis left an impression on us. Louv asserts that children suffer from \u201cnature-deficit disorder\u201d when they don\u2019t spend enough time under the sky among other living creatures. Already in the habit of limiting our kids\u2019 screen time, it was natural to delay buying them electronics. We relented with the purchase of tablets, mainly for use during our frequent trips to visit faraway family, but we never graduated to smaller, more portable devices. We wanted our children to spend their time playing outside. And reading books. And talking with us. So we never bought them phones. They kept getting older, and we kept not buying them phones. Now that they are in middle and high school, I realize that their childhood has been somewhat different from their friends\u2019\u2014and also remarkably different from mine.\n\nIn middle school in the 1980s, my friends and I whiled away our free time unsupervised at the skating rink, the mall, and the arcade. In high school, we graduated to more secluded places where we could park, turn up the music, and hang out unseen by prying, parental eyes. Even the most undesirable place, a vacant lot underneath an interstate overpass, was a haven as long as your friends were there. Now, a mere 30 years later, the skating rinks and arcades are closed, and my kids\u2019 lives bear little resemblance to those of my childhood friends and myself.\n\nIn The Atlantic, Jean M. Twenge discussed her 25-year study of generational differences in the United States. She found that how today\u2019s teenagers spend their time is immensely different from how every preceding generation of teens back to the Baby Boomers spent theirs, and all evidence of cause points to the emergence of the smartphone and the birth of social media. Teenagers today are more likely to be at home, connected to the world via Wi-Fi. Yet at the same time, they are more likely to feel isolated and unhappy. Twenge writes, \u201cThe number of teens who get together with their friends nearly every day dropped by more than 40 percent from 2000 to 2015.\u201d Ironically, the technology that promises to connect us all is also leaving us more alienated.", "description": "Denying a teenager a smartphone in 2019 is a tough decision, and one that requires an organized and impenetrable defense.", "authors": ["Sarah P.
