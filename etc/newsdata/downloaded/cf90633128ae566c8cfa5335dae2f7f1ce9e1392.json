Even if our men are captured, we are also soldiers of the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nAnother said \u201chundreds will be lining up to replace him\u201d and that the idea of the caliphate did not die with one man.\n\nThe SDF has for months been sounding the alarm, warning that they have neither the money nor manpower to contain the radicalised and increasingly violent detainees. In recent weeks, detainees have stabbed a number of guards and beaten other residents to death.\n\nAl-Hol, in particular, has variously been described as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d, a \u201cmini caliphate\u201d, and \u201cCamp Bucca II\u201d after the notorious US-run detention centre in Iraq which spawned Baghdadi and his cohort.\n\nThe camp is full of women refusing to give up on the Islamic State, and their children, who have been brainwashed by years of Isil indoctrination.\n\nMark Esper, US secretary of defence, warned last night that despite Baghdadi\u2019s death the security situation in Syria remains \u201ccomplex\u201d.\n\n\"Acting as a police force to solve every dispute, forever, is not our mission,\" he said.\n\nRelations between the SDF and the US had been strained over President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops supporting the Kurdish partner forces on the ground.\n\nThe group had ordered many of its fighters to abandon posts guarding the Isil prisoners to fend off a Turkish invasion at the border.\n\nA few days after the decision was made more than 100 Isil detainees escaped from a prison in the Kurdish-held north-east, close to Turkey\u2019s \u201cbuffer zone\u201d, amid reports of Turkish shelling.", "description": "Syrian Kurdish forces said on Monday they are beefing up security in prisons and detention camps where tens of thousands of Isil militants and their supporters are held, fearing a reaction to the death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ACzRrTxeRd4pMw7cSg.PMg--~B/aD0xMTMxO3c9MTgwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/96e94afa08c50b48b519e02ea35bb37d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
