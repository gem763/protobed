Peterson, among others \u2014 all sharing how strictures on speech at colleges seep into the culture at large.\n\nThe film also examines and criticizes China\u2019s history of free speech suppression, a topical analysis given the discord over the NBA\u2019s apology to Beijing for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests.\n\nLike many other independent features, \u201cNo Safe Spaces\u201d is opening small and slowly expanding next month to other cities, including Highlands Ranch, Colorado; San Diego; and Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe documentary features the unabashedly conservative Mr. Prager and Mr. Carolla, who eschews political labels but embraces some libertarian positions such as support for same-sex marriage.\n\nSelect scenes show campus speakers being forced off stages or drowned out by protesters unwilling to let them be heard. That typically means right-leaning voices such as The Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro and Mr. Peterson.\n\nMr. Prager, who hosts a nationally syndicated radio show, said \u201cNo Safe Spaces\u201d takes aim at the halls of academia, where \u201csnowflake\u201d students require so-called safe spaces, where their sensibilities will not be offended, their ideas will not be challenged and their beliefs will not be examined.\n\n\u201cWe have virtually every school in America, from elementary schools to graduate schools, and virtually all the major media arrayed against us. The left in America, as everywhere else since Lenin, suppresses speech,\u201d Mr. Prager said. \u201cAnd liberals, who always fought for free speech, do nothing because they have bought the lie that their enemies are to their right, not to their left.\u201d\n\nThe documentary makers visited a number of colleges for the movie, which gave Mr. Prager an insight into the mindset of modern students. Their positions don\u2019t necessarily reflect the image conjured by the media and social platforms such as Twitter. Many students, he said, craved \u201csomething moral, rational and uplifting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why so many students come to my speeches and to those given by the few other conservatives who speak on campuses,\u201d Mr. Prager said.\n\nStill, Mr. Prager isn\u2019t optimistic that free speech is ready for a nationwide comeback. That will require both sides of the political aisle to join together for the common good, he said. That\u2019s increasingly uncommon of late, but it also connects to precedent.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, throughout history, the decent rarely fight. At the very least, therefore, people who cherish freedom and who cherish America should at least help those who are fighting,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Carolla offers a more optimistic take, thanks in large part to comedy.\n\nIn recent weeks, top-tier stand-up comics such as Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr have taken up the \u201cNo Safe Spaces\u201d fight, courtesy of their respective Netflix specials.\n\nMr. Chappelle playfully mocked his audience, saying their attempts to regulate his jokes made him curtail his stand-up career. Mr. Burr, in turn, shredded those eager to \u201ccancel\u201d people for telling the \u201cwrong\u201d jokes.\n\nMr. Carolla said comedians like Mr. Burr and Mr. Chappelle can be part of a societal correction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a tipping point, and maybe comedians can lead the way back to sanity,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
