He was pictured alongside his brother's girlfriend and her father\n\nHe was quick to add that he had not been involved in the racism nor had he been a part of the hooded gang.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside court, Dimitar said: 'I was at the game and my brother was not. The police have lied and said he was there but he wasn't.\n\n'The police spoke to me for only a short time and let me go. I do not understand why they have arrested my brother...\n\n'Nothing happened [at the match], I was there, I was waving to a friend who I saw in the stands, I was waving with my arm in the air and with all my fingers, just like normal.'\n\nDimitar also made claims that the police had 'forced' his brother to make a false statement after he was arrested, stating that he was at the match despite apparently being with his girlfriend at the time.\n\nDimitar was quick to add that he had not been involved in the racist abuse nor had he been a part of the hooded gang\n\nDimitar was speaking alongside his brother's girlfriend and her father, who said he had cooked dinner for the couple on the evening of the match.\n\nThe defence asked to question Dimitar during the brief court hearing but this was rejected.\n\nIt is thought that the Bulgarian police have so far identified 16 people involved in the abuse but Tzvetan Gechev is the only person that has so far been charged.\n\nHe is already serving a suspended sentence for assault and if he is found guilty of racist abuse then he could face up to five years behind bars.\n\nIt is thought that the Bulgarian police have so far identified 16 people involved in the abuse but Tzvetan Gechev is the only person that has so far been charged\n\nThe former head of the Bulgarian soccer association Borislav Mikhailov resigned following the racist abuse at the match where England enjoyed a resounding 6-0 win.\n\nHis resignation was prompted by calls for him to step down from the country's prime minister which came shortly after the team's manager Krasimir Balakov also quit his post.\n\nUEFA's final decision will is likely to mean the national team will receive a fine or could even be banned from recognised football leagues.", "description": "Tzvetan Gechev, 18, appeared at the\u00a0Sofia District Court in the Bulgarian capital yesterday.
