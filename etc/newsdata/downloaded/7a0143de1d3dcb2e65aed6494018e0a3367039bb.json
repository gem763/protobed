That followed news of the weakest US manufacturing conditions since 2009 at the height of the financial crisis.\n\nThe figures also come before the release of non-farm payrolls data Friday that are closely watched for a gauge on the health of the economy, with observers now fretting that a slowdown across the world could now be biting in the United States.\n\nNew York traders rushed for the exit, as did their European counterparts who were also hammered by fears Britain will leave the EU without a divorce deal as well as increasingly bleak economic data in the region.\n\n\"The market was still digesting the weaker (factory) data and the implication for global growth then got whacked with the slide on the ADP data compounded by a catastrophic decline in US auto sales, which now raises more questions than answers about the resilience of the US consumer,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nHopes for a China-US trade breakthrough \"could keep the risk-on light flickering, but the dreary economic data does perhaps suggest that traders could be better sellers in this risk-toxic environment\", he added.\n\n- Brussels cool on Brexit plan -\n\nJust as Washington and Beijing prepare for high-level trade talks this month, the World Trade Organization provided markets with a fresh headache by ruling that the EU had given illegal support to plane-maker Airbus, allowing the US to impose billions in tariffs on the bloc.\n\nWashington later announced a series of levies starting on October 18.\n\nHowever, the WTO is due to rule in the next six months on whether to allow the EU to impose its own huge tariffs the other way over US subsidies to Boeing, raising the possibility of another bruising trade war between the US and a key trade ally.\n\nAsian equity markets were all deep in the red. Tokyo ended two percent lower while Sydney shed more than two percent, Wellington lost 1.2 percent and Hong Kong was down 0.4 percent.\n\nSingapore shed 0.8 percent, Taipei eased 0.7 percent, and Manila, Mumbai and Jakarta were also lower. Shanghai and Seoul were closed for holidays.\n\nIn early trade London was flat and Paris edged up 0.2 percent.\n\nThe weak US data has ramped up the possibility the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for a third time this month, weighing on the dollar against most currencies including higher-yielding, riskier units.\n\nIt held its ground against the pound after Prime Minister Boris Johnson published his \"final\" Brexit proposals and warned the EU that Britain would leave without a deal on October 31 if the bloc did not accept them.\n\nBrussels reacted coolly to the proposal, raising the likelihood of a messy divorce just as the British economy comes under strain.\n\nOil prices were unable to recover Wednesday's heavy losses caused by worries about the effects on demand from the stuttering global economy.\n\nBoth main contracts are now below their levels before last month's rocket attack on Saudi crude facilities that wiped out five percent of world supplies and sent prices soaring.\n\n- Key figures around 0720 GMT -\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.0 percent at 21,341.74 (close)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.4 percent at 25,929.37\n\nShanghai - Composite: Closed for a public holiday\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: FLAT at 7,123.36\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 107.15 yen from 107.16 yen\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0950 from $1.0958 at 2115 GMT\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2280 from $1.2295\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP five cents at $52.69 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN five cents at $57.64 per barrel\n\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 1.9 percent at 26,078.62 (close)", "description": "Asian markets tanked Thursday after a below-par US jobs report compounded worries about the world's top economy, while the WTO fanned fresh trade war fears by allowing Washington to impose tariffs on the European Union.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xIbKu57idoxe_ZwRJywilA--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/1062147ee7d1c2ad6985af6fc6305e5eb7f6edc1.jpg"}
