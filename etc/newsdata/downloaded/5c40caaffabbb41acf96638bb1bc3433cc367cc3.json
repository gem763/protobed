Tucked in the middle of press release, though, was some more pause-worthy news: that co-chairs Bob Bland, Tamika Mallory, and Linda Sarsour \u201cwill transition off of the Women\u2019s March Board and onto other projects focused on advocacy within their respective organizations.\u201d And this shakeup isn\u2019t exactly a recent development. According to the Washington Post, the women stepped down in mid-July.\n\nWhile the Women\u2019s March has certainly seen success, it has been plagued by rumors of financial mismanagement and infighting among its co-chairs. The situation came to a head in December 2018, when Tablet reported that Mallory and co-chair Carmen Perez had made anti-Semitic statements on multiple occasions. This reporting shed a new light on Mallory\u2019s connection to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has said that Jews are \u201cthe mother and father of Apartheid.\u201d (While Mallory disavowed anti-Semitism, she did not renounce Farrakhan.) Following the Tablet report, the Women\u2019s March did itself no favors by fumbling its response to the allegations, which led to calls for the co-chairs to resign. (As of now, Perez is still with the organization.)\n\nWhether or not the split was amicable is unclear. In a statement to the Post, the Women\u2019s March organization thanked the departing co-chairs for their \u201cgroundbreaking work and sacrifices towards equal rights,\u201d and Sarsour told the publication that she\u2019s \u201cgrateful to the women who stepped up to shepherd the Women\u2019s March.\u201d But Bland and Mallory, the co-presidents who will be formally replaced this month, weren\u2019t as effusive: While the former told the Post that the turnover was planned, the latter did not respond to the Post\u2019s multiple requests for comment.\n\nStay in touch.
