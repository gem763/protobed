(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Wednesday cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing third quarter that Chief Executive Jim Hackett blamed on higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker than expected performance in China.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nInvestors sold off Ford shares, which fell 2.5% to $8.98 in after-hours trading while shares in electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surged more than 20% on better than expected results.\n\nIn a conference call with analysts, Hackett said Ford \u201cexperienced more headwinds\u201d than expected in the quarter.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended,\u201d Hackett said, referring to earnings before interest and taxes.\n\nThe disappointing financial results are a setback for Hackett, the former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase, who took over Ford in May 2017 after the abrupt ouster of Ford veteran Mark Fields.\n\nFor two years, Hackett has been asking investors to be patient with a methodical restructuring that has made progress, including a wide-ranging alliance on electric vehicles with Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and the sale of money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHN.NS).\n\nBut by Ford\u2019s own reckoning, most of the restructuring work has yet to be done. It has booked only $3.3 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring, up from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe company also suffered a bumpy introduction of the redesigned Ford Explorer and all-new Lincoln Aviator in the quarter, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s president of automotive.\n\n\u201cWe were disappointed in the overall performance,\u201d he told analysts, referring to the uneven vehicle launch and production ramp-up at an aging Chicago assembly plant.\n\n\u201cWe took on too much,\u201d said Hinrichs, citing the difficulty of launching the Explorer and Aviator simultaneously while it was breaking in a new assembly line at the 95-year-old Chicago plant. \u201cWe have plenty of inventory now at dealers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe third quarter included $1.5 billion in costs for the company\u2019s global restructuring, $800 million of which was related to the formation of a joint venture in India with Mahindra.\n\nFord\u2019s ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe.\n\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker still faces the prospect of negotiating a new four-year labor agreement with the United Auto Workers following the union\u2019s more than month-long strike against General Motors Co (GM.N), which cost GM about $2 billion according to analysts.\n\nFord reported a third-quarter net profit of $425 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $991 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding one-time charges, Ford earned 34 cents a share, above the 26 cents analysts had expected according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue in the quarter fell 2% to $37 billion, above the $33.98 billion expected.\n\nVirtually all of Ford\u2019s third-quarter pretax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. (FCHA.MI)\n\nFord said Wednesday it now expects a full-year adjusted operating profit in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year. In July, it had forecast an increase in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion.\n\nFord also said it expects adjusted earnings this year in the range of $1.20 to $1.32 a share. Previously, the high end of its forecast had been $1.35. Analysts expect $1.26 a share.\n\nFord\u2019s third-quarter operating profit in North America was just over $2 billion. Its U.S. sales in the quarter fell 4.9%, but demand for lucrative pickups remained strong with an increase of almost 9%.\n\nChina revenue in the quarter slid about $300 million to $900 million and Ford\u2019s share in that market fell to 2.3% from 2.9% last year.\n\nFord\u2019s third-quarter sales in China fell 30% as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.\n\nIn September, Moody\u2019s downgraded Ford\u2019s credit rating to junk status - below what it rates larger rival GM - citing Ford\u2019s operating and market challenges, and weak cash generation due to its global restructuring.", "description": "Ford Motor Co on Wednesday cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing third quarter that Chief Executive Jim Hackett blamed on higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker than expected performance in China.", "authors": ["Ben Klayman", "Paul Lienert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444275775&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1X3-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
