[Read the full argument here]\n\n2. \u201cThe notion that a president won\u2019t step aside when the time comes has always been unthinkable. Now it\u2019s a question that\u2019s openly debated.\u201d\n\nPeter Nicholas, one of our White House reporters, takes a deeper look at how Trump is collapsing the line between self and country:\n\nPerhaps the most extreme expression of Trump\u2019s vaulting self-conception is his use of the word treason. [Read Peter\u2019s reporting here.]\n\n3. \u201cAmerica already knows what Barack Obama thinks about Donald Trump (the man) and Donald Trump (the president).\u201d Our campaign reporter Isaac Dovere checks in from Chicago, where both 44 and 45 were speaking at separate events:\n\nFor the past four years, nearly everything in politics has seemed to be about just the two of them\u2014and in a way, everything is. Each is an archetype.

Here\u2019s a compelling questioning of \u201cMayor Pete\u2019s\u201d progressive credentials.\n\n\u2014Elaine Godfrey, who covers Democrats\u2014and all things Iowa\u2014for The Atlantic.\n\n\u00b6 Buttigieg particularly irks leftists\u2014though he\u2019s far from the most centrist Democrat in the race. This piece gives a good window into that derision.\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai, an editor on our politics desk\n\n*\n\n\u00ab BEFORE YOU GO \u00bb\n\n(From Twitter / @mcnaughtonart)\n\nThis odd little reimagining of the classic painting Dogs Playing Poker caught our newsroom\u2019s attention as it floated around online.\n\nAn art historian, writing for The Atlantic, called its painter Jon McNaughton a court artist for the Trump times.\n\n*\n\n\u00ab ABOUT US \u00bb Today\u2019s edition of our daily newsletter of political ideas and arguments was written by Shan Wang, with help from Saahil Desai, and edited by Michael Owen.
