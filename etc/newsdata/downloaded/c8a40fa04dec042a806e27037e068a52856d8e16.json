She was dressed in a tight black skirt and wearing impossibly high heels. She handed me her lighter before I even had a chance to take out mine. \"Cheers,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled sweetly and introduced herself as Vanessa.\n\nREAD MORE: #MyPartnerWillNeverKnow \u2013 I stopped taking the pill and then 'this' happened\n\nHer piercing blue eyes were locked on me as we got chatting. I explained how I'd recently gone through a break-up with my partner of five years, Matt, and had come out for a night on the town with my friends.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe I'll meet Mr Right in there,\" I chuckled.\n\nVanessa touched my shoulder affectionately. \"You don't need a man to have fun,\" she said. \"Why don't you come with me - I'll show you where the party's really at.\"\n\nREAD MORE: #MyPartnerWillNeverKnow \u2013 The truth about my last pregnancy and our \u2018premature\u2019 daughter\n\nI know we'd only just met, but I felt so at ease with Vanessa that I climbed into a taxi with her, texting my mates to say I'd gone home feeling sick. In the cab, I learned that Vanessa was a tattoo artist who'd recently gone vegan after her idol the popstar Ariana Grande had done the same.\n\n\"Gosh Ariana's soooo hot,\" she said with a sigh. Eventually we pulled up at a dimly lit bar in Sydney's inner-west.\n\nInside, there wasn't a man in sight. \"It's ladies' night,\" Vanessa explained, handing me a cosmopolitan. We danced slowly at first but when Ariana Grande's song, Into You blasted through the speakers, she downed her drink in one gulp and danced like a woman possessed.\n\nREAD MORE: #MyPartnerWillNeverKnow \u2013 The only reason I\u2019m still with him is because my lover left me to reunite with his wife\n\n\"Come on,\" she said, pulling me close. I tried to enjoy myself as Ariana crooned: I'm so into you, I can barely breathe... A little less conversation and a little more touch my body.\n\nAs if she was guided by the lyrics, Vanessa put her hands on my waist and pushed her body against mine, reaching up to graze my breast. Blame it on the booze, but I suddenly cottoned on to what should have been obvious: we were in a lesbian bar.\n\n\"Vanessa, I'm not..\" I began weakly, my protests already drowned out by the music.\n\n\"Shhhh,\" she hushed and whispered in my ear: \"A little less conversation, a little more touch my body.\"\n\nREAD MORE: #MyPartnerWillNeverKnow \u2013 His mother made me promise to keep her explosive family secret\n\nIn that second, we began making out like teenagers. I don't know what came over me but kissing her luscious lips felt like I was walking on water. Once we started, I couldn't stop.\n\nBefore this, the ace closest I'd come to kissing a girl was listening to the Katy Perry song. I had plenty of gay friends, but it was something I'd never felt. The song hadn't even finished before she was dragging me to her flat. I woke up the next morning, naked and beside Vanessa.\n\nI pushed the entire incident out of my mind and quickly downloaded Tinder, going on so many dud dates I actually questioned whether men really did float my boat.\n\nREAD MORE: #MyPartnerWillNeverKnow \u2013 I got a helping hand to boost our sex life\n\nAfter months of failures, I found Wayne, a handsome barber who swept me off my feet. We'd been dating just five months when he proposed.\n\n\"How about we get a tattoo of each other's names,\" he suggested. \"My sister's a tattooist and can do it for free.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I replied.\n\nI could have dropped dead on the spot when we arrived at the tattoo parlour to be greeted by Vanessa!\n\nREAD MORE: #MyPartnerWillNeverKnow \u2013 The secret between me and his estranged son\n\nTo her credit, she was very professional but gave me a seductive wink when Wayne turned his back.\n\nThese days Wayne and I are happily married, but I feel on edge whenever Vanessa's around. She's brushed up against me too many times for it to be an accident, and insists on giving me a kiss on the lips.\n\nPart of me is grateful to her for my sexual awakening, though I'm terrified Wayne might one day learn about our steamy night together. I know he wouldn't be happy to hear that his sister had her way with me first.\n\n*Cassie is 27 years old and lives in Hornsby, New South Whales, Australia.\n\nIf you are in a similar situation as these women you can share your story with us here.\n\n\n\nSOURCES: CEN/MAGAZINE FEATURES\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our stories and giveaways.", "description": "Seven real women share a secret that their other half must never find out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/8c788f855c454333b8f7a24ec0589f40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
