Kavanaugh appears at a confirmation hearing Sept. 5, 2018. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nNew York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly are eager to present the broad-brush themes of their new book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d In a New York Times essay over the weekend to introduce the book, the reporters sketch out the cultural clash experienced by Deborah Ramirez during her years at Yale University, where, she later alleged, fellow student Brett M. Kavanaugh whipped out his penis during a drunken dorm party. She allegedly had to push it away.\n\nThough others laughed at the incident, \u201cTo Ms. Ramirez it wasn\u2019t funny at all. It was the nadir of her first year, when she often felt insufficiently rich, experienced or savvy to mingle with her more privileged classmates.\u201d\n\nSociological insights are fine and all, but the news-consuming public fixated on another aspect of the essay:\n\nWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jonathan Lemire tweeted:\n\nFormer Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer:\n\nIt is stunning that the @nytimes publishes a fresh allegation of sexual assault by a sitting Supreme Court Justice in the 9th paragraph of a story on another topic. https://t.co/is5JPHfLAZ \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 15, 2019\n\nThere was a lot of such sentiment on Twitter over the weekend. It was social media\u2019s way of saying: No, silly, that\u2019s not the lead. This is the lead.\n\nThe roar from the Internet left the New York Times with some explaining to do. How did this piece land in the Sunday Review section? What was going on here? The newspaper\u2019s communications team tweeted out some answers, noting that the book by Pogrebin and Kelly \u201cis a well-reported and newsworthy account that reveals new details and sheds new light on a matter of significant national interest. . . . The excerpt of the book was published in the Sunday Review, a section that includes both news analysis and opinion pieces. The section frequently runs excerpts of books produced by Times reporters. . . . The new revelations contained in the piece were uncovered during the reporting process for the book, which is why this information did not appear in The Times before the excerpt.\u201d\n\nPerfectly sensible. Another possible explanation as to why the Times didn\u2019t give more prominence to the new allegation is that it rests on some less-than-direct reporting. For one, the Times reporters didn\u2019t interview Stier; they spoke with \u201ctwo officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.\u201d And the female student who was allegedly subjected to this sexual assault \u201cdeclined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.\u201d Not all of these caveats appeared in the initial version of the story, as an editor\u2019s note subsequently pointed out:\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: Sept. 15, 2019 An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\u2019s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nThat\u2019s a grievous omission, one that could account for some of the outrage following initial publication of the piece. Calls to impeach Kavanaugh \u2014 elevated last year to Supreme Court justice \u2014 came from several Democratic presidential candidates. \u201cLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached,\u201d tweeted Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe Post, in its own coverage of the ruckus, disclosed that it had passed on the story during the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. Here\u2019s its explanation: \u201cThe Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment. The Times article, drawing from reporting for a forthcoming book, is based on interviews with \u2018two officials who have communicated with Mr. \u00adStier.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn reporting their book, Pogrebin and Kelly had a commodity that Republicans placed in short supply back in the confirmation process: time. They found several people who\u2019d heard of the Ramirez incident before Kavanaugh had ascended to the federal bench. \u201cDuring his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been \u2018the talk of campus.\u2019 Our reporting suggests that it was,\u201d reads the news analysis piece in the Times. On both the Ramirez and Stier accounts, the FBI did very little investigating, report the authors. It interviewed none of at least 25 people who Ramirez & Co. said could provide corroborating evidence; it didn\u2019t investigate the Stier allegation.\n\nJust how the Pogrebin-Kelly collaboration advances the state of knowledge is a bit unclear. For instance, the New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrowand Jane Mayerhad already cited several people who were familiar with the Ramirez story prior to its emergence as part of the Kavanaugh fight. And NBC News last year reported that the FBI hadn\u2019t contacted \u201cdozens\u201d of potential sources with possible information on the judge. We\u2019ve asked the book\u2019s PR rep what\u2019s new in the account.\n\nWhatever the case, it\u2019s clear that even though the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh, it left unfinished business in the file. After Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats pushed for a supplemental FBI investigation into the matter -- and the Senate GOP approved a week delay to allow for such a step. President Trump ordered the FBI to assist, but the investigation was cursory. Or, in the well-chosen words of Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), a \u201csham.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders thus had a choice back in 2018. Door No. 1: Authorize a legitimate FBI investigation with no time limits, and get the full scoop on the nominee. Door No. 2: Rush the whole thing and allow further information to drip its way into the public realm over time. We are watching the Door No. 2 scenario play out in real time. It has the added disadvantage of discrediting the FBI, the Senate and the Supreme Court all at once.\n\nThe Times isn\u2019t looking too glorious either. In addition to initially omitting details about the woman in the Stier incident, it promoted the story with a dreadful and offensive tweet:\n\n\u201cHAVING\n\nA\n\nPENIS\n\nTHRUST\n\nIN\n\nYOUR\n\nFACE\n\nMAY\n\nSEEM\n\nLIKE\n\nHARMLESS\n\nFUN\u201d\n\n\n\nTo who?
