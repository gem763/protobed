This is due to the fact that recuperation time after an injury is also written in as a part of their contracts.\n\nDongwan is a member of Shinhwa (Picture: Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images)\n\nThe singer believes more needs to be done (Picture: Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\n\u2018As the media grows larger and as the entertainment industry grows larger, there are many things that one side requires from the other, and vice versa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Even in harsh conditions where young people cannot eat properly or sleep properly, more and more adults are demanding that they wear a bright and healthy smile. You must be sexy, but you cannot have sex; you must be tough, but you cannot fight with anyone. This is what is required of them.\u2019\n\nThe T.O.P singer continued: \u2018Many hoobaes [young artists with less experience in the industry] are currently fighting a battle within themselves, debating how much sickness can they bear in their hearts and continue to work, all for the sake of the sweetness that money and fame provides.\u2019\n\nDongwan added: \u2018We must not fail to notice how readily the lazy actions of large entertainment companies can become the host of a contagious virus that can spread instantaneously.\u2019\n\nSulli has passed away (Picture: Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\nSulli debuted with f(x) in 2009 (Picture: Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\nThe singer debuted with SM Entertainment in March 1998 with Lee Min-woo, Shin Hye-sung, Jun Jin, Eric Mun and Andy Lee in the band Shinhwa, but in July 2003, when the boys\u2019 contracts expired, the agency offered all of them an extension bar Dongwan.\n\nThe band decided to leave SM for Good Entertainment, and now operate under the Shinhwa Company \u2013 although they had to battle SM for years to continue using their band name.\n\nSulli debuted with f(x) under SM Entertainment in 2009, and had major success with the girlband.\n\nHowever, the singer, real name Choi Jin-ri, chose to go on hiatus in 2014 as she was struggling with trolling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA statement from SM at the time read: \u2018\u2018f(x) member Sulli became mentally and physically exhausted from the continuous, malicious comments and false rumours, and has expressed her wish to take a break from her celebrity activities for the time being.\u2019\n\nSulli left the band for good in 2015, but in June 2019, she released her solo debut single album with SM, called Goblin.\n\nSulli\u2019s death comes nearly two years after another SM Entertainment artist, Jonghyun, died by suicide.\n\nThe SHINee star took his own life aged 27 in December 2017.\n\nNeed support?
