Recently, we learned he financed an expensive car he\u2019s now upside down on. In addition, he has accumulated over $15,000 in credit card debt. He lives in a small town, and only pays $650 a month in rent, but he is asking for money. We taught him about living on a budget and staying out of debt when he was younger, and now it seems he didn\u2019t listen very well. How do you think we should handle this situation?\n\nBryce\n\nDear Bryce,\n\nThe first thing I\u2019d advise telling him is that you and his mom aren\u2019t going to whip out the checkbook, and make his problems disappear. That may sound harsh, but he had a really good thing going until he messed it up by acting impulsively and irresponsibly with his finances. Nope, I wouldn\u2019t take care of it for him\u2014not at his age. This young man needs to have some skin in the game.\n\nI\u2019d tell him to sell the fancy car, and get something way cheaper to drive for a while. I\u2019m talking about a little beater in the $2,000 to $3,000 range. It sounds like he\u2019ll have to get a small loan to cover the difference, but a little car debt is better than a lot of car debt. I\u2019d also advise him to pick up a part-time job nights or weekends until he gets that credit card debt paid off.\n\nIn other words, let him wallow in it and worry about things for a while. Then, if he\u2019s willing to accept responsibility for his actions, and starts handling money more wisely, you two might help out every so often with a little extra cash on the payments.\n\nBut I\u2019d test his resolve first. And I\u2019d want to see proof he has learned from his mistakes!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,Our son is 27, and he has a good .09/02/2019 3:03:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/304/c2745452-6c3e-44f6-b64f-3ae054eff714.jpg"}
