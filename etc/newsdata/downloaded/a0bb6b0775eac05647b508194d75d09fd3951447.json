The clanging of iron, the blast of the Wheelabrator, the general din of steel being punched, sheared and burned into enormous structural components \u2014 some weighing as much as 300 tonnes \u2014 all signify the plant is operating at its peak.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the facility has often done just that, pumping out complex steel segments to be loaded onto barges, carried on the nearby Fraser River and ultimately incorporated into an impressive list of industrial and commercial projects. Supreme\u2019s steel can be found in the Port Mann Bridge in nearby Surrey, the Texada Island ship loader and countless energy industry projects that have long been the bread and butter for Western Canadian fabricators.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, we did the Lions Gate Bridge, we did the first Vancouver Convention Centre, not to mention the second,\u201d said Kevin Guile, Supreme Steel\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cA lot came through here.\u201d\n\nBut times change. As capital spending in the oil and gas business steadily thinned over the years, so too did the order books for Supreme\u2019s five Canadian fabrication plants. By this past summer, the decline was enough that Guile found himself flying into Delta from Supreme\u2019s Acheson, Alta., head office to announce plans to shutter the plant for good, cutting 130 jobs. The closure of a second facility in Winnipeg will cut another 60 jobs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been peaks and valleys we\u2019ve gone through, but this had to do with the long-term erosion in demand,\u201d Guile said. \u201cWe had to consolidate.\u201d\n\nFurther north in B.C., some recent flickers of life have emerged even as overall energy sector spending flatlines. A joint venture led by Royal Dutch Shell PLC broke ground on a $40-billion liquefied natural gas project in Kitimat earlier this year. And Singapore\u2019s Pacific Oil and Gas Ltd. plans to announce an investment decision on the smaller $1.6-billion Woodfibre LNG this fall.\n\nThey are the sorts of anchor projects that could keep beleaguered steel fabricators like Supreme Steel running for years. Yet much of that opportunity has been effectively dashed, fabricators say, by a federal Department of Finance decision to grant a rare exemption on certain Canadian anti-dumping and countervailing duties \u2014 a move that opened the door to large portions of the projects being supplied by China.\n\n\u201cThe LNG project had a lot of promise and a lot of excitement around it because it was the first big project seen in Western Canada in a lot of years,\u201d said Neil Rasmussen, president of Edmonton based Bri-Steel Manufacturing, which supplies complex pipe systems to the energy sector. \u201cBut when you consider that all the steel is going to supplied over (in China), it\u2019s all going to be fabricated and constructed over there, we\u2019re just going to assemble it or stack it up \u2026 how much of it is really happening here, you know?\u201d\n\nAt issue are imports of fabricated industrial steel components (FISC), the massive modules outfitted with sophisticated equipment essential to an LNG terminal. Rather than ship steel and other raw materials to remote sites, energy companies are increasingly opting for modularization, a form of construction in which large box-like components are built in vast mod yards and assembled on-site like Lego blocks.\n\nThe modules sought by LNG Canada are enormous, equivalent in height to a 12-storey building and in length to an Olympic-sized swimming pool. They are expected to weigh in at more than 3,600 tonnes.\n\nThose specifications ruled out using Canadian module suppliers, LNG Canada said, because no component even close to that size has ever been built or transported here. Only a few mod yards in the world have the expertise and experience to deliver all 200 components LNG Canada requires, the consortium said. The yard that LNG Canada picked is a massive joint venture between Fluor Corp. and China Offshore Oil Engineering Co. Ltd. on China\u2019s southern coast near Hong Kong.\n\nThe steel modules are a massive component of the $40-billion LNG Canada project. The value of the engineering, procurement and construction contract \u2014 which includes the 200 modules \u2014 is US$14 billion, according to a press release from Fluor. By contrast, the Coastal GasLink pipeline connecting to the LNG facility will use primarily domestic steel and will cost $6.2 billion.\n\nSourcing the modules from Canada \u201cwould not have allowed the project to be competitive with other projects in the world, and would have introduced an unacceptable amount of risk,\u201d said LNG Canada spokesperson Susannah Pierce.\n\nCanada\u2019s steel fabricators don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true and in August 2016 complained to the country\u2019s top trade court that the imported components were made with subsidized, dumped steel.\n\nIn 2017, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) ruled in their favour, finding that modules from China, South Korea and Spain were being dumped, or sold at less than fair value, in Canada. Anti-dumping duties of 45.8 per cent were imposed on the fabricated steel contained in the modules from all three countries, while steel in the Chinese modules was also found to be subsidized, prompting an additional duty of up to 70 per cent.\n\nThough the LNG consortium requested an exclusion, arguing the modules they needed couldn\u2019t be made in Canada, the CITT refused. The LNG companies then requested a judicial review by the Federal Court of Appeals.\n\nBut, in a highly unusual move, Ottawa stepped in. In a surprise announcement in August, Finance Minister Bill Morneau granted full duty remissions on the components for both the LNG Canada and Woodfibre LNG projects.\n\n\u201cTrade barriers would not be permitted to stand in the way of these historic private-sector investments,\u201d the government said in a release at the time.\n\nFor long-time Canadian trade lawyer Cyndee Todgham Cherniak, the government\u2019s decision to override its top trade court \u2014 and refer to its duties as \u201cbarriers\u201d \u2014 was shocking.\n\n\u201cIt really was a bizarre, bizarre move by the Department of Finance,\u201d said Todgham Cherniak, of LexSage Professional Corp. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them do it, ever. They are overriding the CITT decision that is currently before the Federal Court of Appeal in a judicial review. Shouldn\u2019t the legal process run its course?\u201d\n\nTodgham Cherniak, who represented LaFarge Canada Inc. in arguing that the CITT had erred in its finding, believes the tribunal should not have sided with the fabricators\u2019 argument that they could make the modules.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the capability to build these larger modules in Canada; it\u2019s not the Chinese circumventing the system,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if you aren\u2019t making them now, you don\u2019t have the capability. You can try, but which lucky company gets to be the guinea pig when you fail?\n\nBut if the finance department believes the modules cannot be produced in Canada, thereby justifying a remission, Todgham Cherniak questions why the exemptions were limited to just two companies instead of being knocked down altogether. And, she believes, referring to the CITT\u2019s decision as a \u201ctrade barrier\u201d throws its expertise into question, opening the door for every ruling on steel to be contested.\n\n\u201cIt really is a whole host of inconsistencies and it does not make sense,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 per cent for political reasons to be able to have this LNG project that this decision was made. It\u2019s really not a coherent trade policy and it\u2019s concerning.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s 100 per cent for political reasons to be able to have this LNG project that this decision was made Todgham Cherniak, trade lawyer\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Finance said the remissions followed appropriate procedures and were warranted because \u201cmodules of the size and complexity required for these projects are not available in Canada.\u201d\n\nThe projects would continue the global shift to clean energy, provide thousands of jobs and \u201cdeliver significant economic and environmental benefits for Canadians,\u201d said Morneau spokesperson Ryan Dunn.\n\nThey are also an important win for an LNG export industry that has struggled to materialize in Canada, despite the great expectations for economic growth by diversifying energy exports.\n\nA decade ago, there were more than 20 LNG project proposals on Canada\u2019s West Coast. By 2015, that number had shrunk to just 10 active proposals and it\u2019s kept on shrinking.\n\nIn recent years, AltaGas Ltd. has cancelled the Triton LNG project, Malaysia\u2019s state-owned oil giant Petronas dropped the $36-billion Pacific NorthWest LNG project, China\u2019s state-owned CNOOC Ltd. killed its $28-billion Aurora LNG project and Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. pulled out of the regulatory process for its $25-billion West Coast Canada LNG project.\n\nMeanwhile, five LNG projects have been built in the United States and are currently super-cooling natural gas until it reaches its liquid form at \u2013160 C for export to more lucrative commodity markets overseas. Another eight are currently under construction, according to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nThe result has been more construction activity and skilled trades work around the U.S. Gulf Coast as well as consistently higher prices for natural gas produced south of the border.\n\nIndeed, Bri-Steel Manufacturing\u2019s Rasmussen has watched his volume of domestic business fall to a quarter of what it once was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been terrible here in Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cI think 95 per cent of our business this last year-and-a-half has gone to the U.S. If we had to rely on the Canadian market, I don\u2019t think we would exist here anymore.\u201d\n\nRasmussen and Supreme Steel\u2019s Guile are among those who believe Canada could produce super modules of the size LNG projects require. Though Supreme\u2019s Delta plant isn\u2019t suited to module production, that doesn\u2019t mean the industry couldn\u2019t establish a yard somewhere in the lower B.C. mainland, solving shipping problems by moving the modules over water to Kitimat, they say.\n\n\u201cA module yard is really nothing more than a big gravelled area, well compacted, with offices, which are generally trailer complexes, craft buildings for superintendents and so forth,\u201d Guile said. \u201cIt\u2019s not overly complex, the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOthers are less sure. Canada\u2019s fabricators have made big modules for energy projects before \u2014 producing them in Edmonton-based mod yards \u2014 but they\u2019ve never built a component of the size LNG requires. The largest one ever constructed was estimated to be about 1,000 tonnes.\n\nSize is one thing, transportation is another. The LNG modules are about six times bigger than the largest module that has ever moved on Alberta\u2019s oversized load network, which is used to ship giant units to the oilsands, said Pieridae Energy Ltd. spokesperson James Millar.\n\nPieridae is currently working towards building a $10-billion LNG project called Goldboro in Nova Scotia to export gas to Europe.\n\nMillar said the company will take the advice of its engineering, procurement and construction contractor, Houston-based KBR Inc., on where to source the steel for that project. Goldboro will require domestic steel as well, but Millar said the oversized modules would be a challenge to source domestically.\n\nThe perspective is shared by LNG Canada.\n\n\u201cLNG Canada took a calculated, but significant risk to move forward with overseas module fabrication based on the merits of our case: large complex modules cannot be made in Canada,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nPierce said the Coastal GasLink pipeline connected to the LNG Canada facility will use Canadian steel and the company will be using 13,000 metric tonnes of rebar for other construction needs at the site.\n\nOther opportunities for Canadian steel are also expected to emerge, though JGC Fluor BC LNG JV, the engineering, procurement and construction company for the project, would not know the breakdown between domestic and imported steel at this point, she said.\n\n\u201cThey will determine the amount (of domestic vs. imported steel) as part of their contracting and procurement strategy over the next few years as part of their lump sum contract,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nB.C. LNG Alliance, an industry group representing LNG export projects, also said large quantities of Canadian steel will be needed though it also declined to say what proportion of a project\u2019s spending on steel would go to domestic companies.\n\n\u201cShould a Canadian domestic and export LNG industry develop at the pace and scale of the global LNG market, the sector will support hundreds of millions of dollars of continual procurement opportunities for steel manufacturers and thousands of new Canadian steel fabrication-related jobs during construction,\u201d the group said in an emailed statement.\n\nThose promises aren\u2019t enough for Canadian steel fabricators missing out on a rising trend in construction, said Ed Whalen, chief executive of the Canadian Institute for Steel Construction, the industry\u2019s primary lobbying voice.\n\nThree to five years ago, there were 36 mod yards open in Edmonton, employing about 8,000 workers, he said. Today, just three are in operation, each employing a skeleton crew of 20 staff.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an LNG story. Residential, hotel developments, all are increasingly using modules,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cModular construction is mainstream now and it will exponentially increase in the coming years. It\u2019s the way things are going to be done. If the work is just sent to China, pretty soon we won\u2019t need the manufacturing facilities that make steel.\u201d\n\nAnd despite promises of other opportunities to supply steel beyond the modules, he said none have appeared yet.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants us to be quiet and let\u2019s just get this project going,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cWe want that too, but not at the expense of our entire industry.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: npowell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: naomi_powell\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Trade Wars: Ottawa's move a win for LNG firms who say Canada can't build the massive infrastructure they need, as domestic steel business tanks", "authors": ["Naomi Powell", "Geoffrey Morgan"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/steel-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
