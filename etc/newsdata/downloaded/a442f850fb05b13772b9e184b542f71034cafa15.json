But his regard for the tricksy Wilson is underappreciated and worth revisiting as Corbyn faces increasing pressure from party activists deeply unhappy over his stance on Brexit.\n\nThe current Labour leader cut his political teeth during the 1966 general election, when, as a member of the Young Socialists, the youth wing of the Labour Party, he campaigned for Wilson in his local constituency, the Shropshire swing seat of The Wrekin.\n\nWhere Corbyn paid lip service to Remain in 2016, he has now vowed to sit out a future referendum altogether, going further even than Wilson in 1975.\n\nSo overjoyed was he by the reelection of the Labour government that as dawn broke on the morning following the count, he and a group of friends climbed the 400-meter summit of The Wrekin (the large hill for which the constituency is named) to sing the Labour party's anthem, \"The Red Flag.\"\n\nSo it is perhaps no surprise that, as Corbyn faces one of his most difficult Labour conferences since his election as party leader four years ago, he has decided to emulate his hero Wilson during the first European referendum of June 1975.\n\nThe 'capitalist club'\n\nIn October of the previous year, Labour had fought the general election on a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum once its renegotiation with the European Economic Community (EEC) \u2014 the precursor to the European Union \u2014 was complete.\n\nThe pledge was taken not at the urging of the public, which polls showed was largely happy with the first 20 months of British membership, but to placate a Labour Party suspicious of the Tory-negotiated terms of entry.\n\nMany on the left were concerned at the prospect of such a huge open market, which, they felt, could only help the forces of capitalism.\n\nMembers of Corbyn\u2019s wing of the party also feared the other member states, largely ruled at the time by centrist and center-right parties, would prove to be a roadblock for socialist projects by a future left-wing British government.\n\n\u201cCorbyn (along with myself and many others on the left) opposed it because we saw the EEC as a capitalist club,\u201d as the Corbyn-sympathetic writer Francis Beckett wrote in the New Statesman in May.\n\nWith the Labour Party divided on the issue, Wilson agreed to an unprecedented breach of collective Cabinet responsibility: Ministers would be permitted to campaign on either side of the referendum debate. Six of the 23-strong Cabinet chose to back \"No\" (to continued British membership), including heavyweights such as Benn, Barbara Castle, Michael Foot and Peter Shore.\n\nLike them, Corbyn favored quitting the EEC in 1975, telling journalists on the eve of his election as leader 20 years later: \u201c'I did vote and I voted \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd it wouldn't be a one-off. As an MP he voted against the Maastricht Treaty that created the European Union in 1993, against the Lisbon Treaty that forms the current constitutional basis of the EU in 2008, and for a referendum on British membership of the EU as far back as 2011 \u2014 breaking the Labour whip to do so.\n\nBut by the time that referendum was held in 2016, Corbyn was now leader of a party that, in the intervening New Labour decades, had become far more Euro-friendly \u2014 certainly compared with 1975.\n\nLofty neutrality\n\nEuroskepticism was largely the preserve of the right, the \u201cfruitcakes and loonies\u201d as David Cameron memorably once called U.K. Independence Party members. The vast majority of mainstream U.K. politicians had teamed up to campaign to remain in the EU.\n\nCorbyn was not yet bold enough to actively move the Labour Party toward a Leave position, or even to advocate for a Wilson-style compromise, so he did what he often does when forced to act in a way he dislikes: He sulked.\n\nOld comrades including Tariq Ali have confirmed that Corbyn would have supported Leave had he not been the party's leader. Instead, he kept as low a profile as possible, at one point disappearing on holiday at the height of the campaign.\n\nIn his memoirs, published last week, Cameron laments Corbyn\u2019s lack of enthusiasm, implying it may have had an impact on the referendum result. \u201c[W]hen I looked to the red team on my left, the leadership, particularly Jeremy Corbyn, just wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he told the Times.\n\nAlan Johnson, who was tasked with leading Labour\u2019s Remain campaign, found his work repeatedly thwarted by Corbyn\u2019s failure to attend campaign events, and the leadership\u2019s insistence in watering-down the few speeches and articles he did release. (Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Seumas Milne, is as much a Euroskeptic as Corbyn.)\n\nCorbyn\u2019s indifference led directly to the greatest threat he ever faced to his leadership, when, following the shocking referendum result, there was a mass walkout of two-thirds of his shadow Cabinet and a no-confidence vote in his leadership.\n\nBut the Europhiles failed in their bid to unseat the leader, and three years on, little has changed in Team Corbyn\u2019s approach to the EU. Indeed, if anything attitudes have hardened.\n\nWhere Corbyn paid lip service to Remain in 2016, he has now vowed to sit out a future referendum altogether, going further even than Wilson in 1975.\n\nPromising that as prime minister he would negotiate a \u201csensible\u201d deal with the EU before putting it to the public in a referendum, he wrote in the Guardian: \u201cI will pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d\n\nIn opting for lofty neutrality, Corbyn has put himself at odds with his longtime ally John McDonnell, his Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer and his Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, as well as the vast majority of Labour MPs, activists, members and, indeed, voters.\n\nBut more important to him, he has remained true to the ideals he held dear when he stroked Harold Wilson the cat while plotting of the downfall of capitalism in his flat in Haringey.\n\nAnd he is doing so with an act of political tightrope walking that would have made the real Harold Wilson proud.\n\nRosa Prince is the author of \"Comrade Corbyn, A Very Unlikely Coup\" (Biteback Publishing, February 2016).\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
