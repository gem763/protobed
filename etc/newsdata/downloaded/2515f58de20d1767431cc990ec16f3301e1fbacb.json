By way of comparison, the monthly average was 7,500 in Barack Obama\u2019s first term and 5,600 in George W. Bush\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cCurrent year-to-date sales are more than 50,000 units higher than at any point in the terms of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and we still have more than two months left in 2019,\u201d Ms. McLean noted.\n\nU.S. Constitution print-edition sales tended to spike around key news events during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term, such as his nomination and inauguration. The most recent sales spike is occurring now, following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s push for formal impeachment hearings, the group said.\n\n\u201cThere have been some other smaller spikes in Constitution sales in recent history \u2014 such as 2010, following the 2009 founding of the tea party,\u201d Ms. McLean said. \u201cHowever, that spike is dwarfed by what we have been seeing since these last few years.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
