Twelve people were killed in the blast, most of them civilians. Among them were two journalists who were there to cover the protest. A further 70 people were injured.\n\nThe incident, coming just days into Turkey\u2019s highly controversial incursion into northern Syria, may be the first recorded war crime by the Nato power since the start of the offensive.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Amnesty verified the imagery and corroborated with witness testimony \u2013 and concluded that this attack clearly violated international humanitarian law,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty\u2019s Middle East research director.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing safe about this zone that Turkey claims it wants to create \u2013 so far, its actions and those of its allies on the ground just demonstrate their utter disregard for civilian lives.\u201d\n\nThe Independent understands the United Nations is also investigating the incident to determine if it constituted a war crime.\n\nThe war has already killed around 80 civilians in Syria and injured more than 400. Over 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting so far. Turkish authorities said at least 18 civilians have been killed in Turkey by mortar fire from Kurdish forces.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The good spirits of the protesters belied the obvious danger they were in as they made their way to Ras al-Ayn. They were heading towards an active war zone, to a city that was being pummelled by airstrikes and artillery. The presence of a small number of armed men in the convoy made the journey even more perilous.\n\nAnd yet, international investigators have told The Independent they believe it would have been unlikely for Turkey \u2013 a country with an advanced drone programme, and with the sophisticated surveillance that provides \u2013 to mistake the convoy for a military target. Videos of previous strikes released by the Turkish military show the clarity of view provided by its aircraft.\n\nThe Turkish military would have seen the convoy make its way slowly along the road for more than 80 miles, stopping along the way. In the town of Tell Tamr more people joined. It was large and visible. They would have seen a large number of women in the group.\n\n\u201cYou might have thought they were going to a wedding, not a war,\u201d said Lindsey Hilsum, a journalist for Channel 4 News, in her dispatch from along the convoy\u2019s route, shortly before it was hit.\n\nOne protester was asked whether she was afraid. She replied: \"We're not scared of fighting. Erdogan has been threatening us for 8 years, but we're not afraid.\"\n\nWhen they reached the city of Ras al-Ayn, perhaps more than 100 people had joined in dozens of minibuses. They stopped in a street lined with shuttered shops, where they stepped out.\n\nThey had purposefully chosen a point in the centre of the city to hold their protest, away from the fighting to the west and the east.\n\nOne video shows the group dancing and singing, somewhat nervously. Another video shows what appears to be the same group gathering. There is a loud bang and a bright flash, followed by darkness. Another video posted online shows the gruesome aftermath of the strike. Bodies lie scattered on the floor while survivors sit up dazed and burned.\n\nA witness later said they did not hear jets in the sky prior to the bombing, which suggests that the explosion could have been caused by artillery or a drone attack, rather than an airstrike. Investigations are now underway to discover the type of munition used.\n\nImages posted online show some of the dead appeared to be holding guns. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least nine people were killed, including five civilians. Kurdish authorities put the number at 12 killed and 74 injured, but did not say how many were civilians.\n\nAn elderly mother of two named Dayika Akide was among the dead, according to local reports. Mohammed Hussein Rasho, a Syrian Kurdish reporter and cameraman for Cira TV, was injured in the blast and died of his wounds the following day, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Syrian Kurdish journalist Saad Ahmed, a reporter for the local news agency Hawar News, was also killed in the strike.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Tuesday that the strike the \u201cworst incident we are aware of so far,\u201d in the conflict. A UN team is now conducting an investigation into the strike.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Middle East and North Africa representative, Ignacio Miguel Delgad, said: \u201cJudging by the evidence we have, the footage and pictures we have seen and testimonies from eyewitnesses, it was clearly a civilian convoy on their way to Ras al-Ayn to protest the Turkish offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cInternational law expressly prohibits attacks on civilians and journalists. CPJ believes this airstrike could constitute a war crime and we call on Turkish authorities to immediately cease their attacks on journalists and civilians,\u201d he added.\n\nFurther investigations are now likely to focus on whether the attack meets the conditions to be a breach of international humanitarian law. That process can be extremely complicated.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly elements here that could lead you to conclude that they knew it was not a military objective,\u201d William Schabas, Professor of International Law, Middlesex University in London, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThere is a burden on the person who drops the bomb to take reasonable efforts to make sure they know the answer to the question about whether the target is military, and even if it is, whether there is an acceptable level of collateral damage to non-combatants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is complicated by the fact that there were armed people with the convoy. It\u2019s not implausible Turkey would say it has a military dimension,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Schabas added that much of how the investigation proceeds will depend on how Turkey responds, or if they respond at all.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s assume we don\u2019t get a credible explanation from Turkey, we still have to reach conclusions of whether there was a war crime,\u201d he said. The fact that the convoy was visible for dozens of miles, and that Turkey would have monitored its progress \u201cis relevant to whether this was a military objective at all.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent.", "description": "They left the northern Syrian city of Qamishli in a convoy of buses, motorbikes and cars.
