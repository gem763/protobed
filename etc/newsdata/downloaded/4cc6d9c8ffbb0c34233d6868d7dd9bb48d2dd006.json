Jason Zuffranieri Might Be Next James Holzhauer", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Jeopardy!/CBS\n\nIf you\u2019ve been sleeping on Jeopardy! since James Holzhauer departed with his astounding $2.4 million haul earlier this year (also, show some respect to the host, please), it\u2019s time to start tuning in again. That\u2019s because Jason Zuffranieri, a mathematics teacher and nice fella from Albuquerque, has low-key amassed over $418,000 since debuting on the show a few weeks ago \u2014 a streak that\u2019s going into day 16 as of Monday. And nobody\u2019s talking about it. Talk about it with us! With these current totals, Zuffranieri now holds two notable Jeopardy! records alongside some of the best players to ever grace the game show: He sits in third (!) for highest winnings during regular-season play after living legends Ken Jennings and Holzhauer, and fifth for consecutive games won. Albuquerque needs good press right now, so congrats again to Zuffranieri!", "description": "Jason Zuffranieri is on a winning streak on Jeopardy, now winning his fifteenth game and over $400,000 in winnings.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-jeopardy-jason-zuffranieri.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
