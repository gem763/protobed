Besides Nextlink, 102 other bidders were awarded $1.49bn over 10 years to build out broadband networks.\n\nNextlink and other CAF II-funded ISPs are now required by the FCC to build services to 40% of the designated locations within three years and complete the rollout within six years. CAF II aims to bring fixed broadband and voice services to over 700,000 locations in 45 states.\n\n\"We have an accelerated plan to not just meet the FCC's six-year buildout requirement but exceed it. We plan on investing over $100m in the first four years of this buildout effort,\" says Nextlink CEO and co-founder Bill Baker.\n\nMicrosoft has criticized the FCC for severely underestimating the number of Americans who lack broadband access. The tech company reckons 162 million people across the US can't access broadband speeds, while the FCC estimates the number to be just 21 million.\n\nMicrosoft also estimates that 29 million Americans don't have broadband speeds in the areas Nextlink will address in the next six years.\n\nBaker says the agreement with Microsoft will allow for a faster deployment of high-speed broadband to underserved areas.\n\nThe states covered by the deal account for about a third of US agricultural output worth over $120bn a year, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nUSDA estimates connected technologies enabled by better broadband would allow farms to adopt precision agricultural production techniques and could create $47bn in additional gross benefit for the US economy.\n\nMicrosoft in December said it had already reached one million people in 16 states with Airband and announced it would make broadband available to three million people by July 2022.\n\nMore on Microsoft and US broadband", "description": "Microsoft contributes its 'TV white space' tech to the FCC's Connect America Fund (CAF) II broadband program.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/19/134215b6-20c3-4974-998f-352453df1cab/thumbnail/770x578/f336f74fe5fbb06e2c969e4e19325dc5/farminglaptopistock-497681892.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
