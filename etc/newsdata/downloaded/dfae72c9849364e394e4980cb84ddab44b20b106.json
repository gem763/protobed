Instead, he proposed, perhaps based on a line of John Henry Newman, that Christian history is composed of roughly 300- to 400-year periods. Each age begins in crisis but also with intense spiritual activity and a new sense of mission to evangelize the world. It then has a \u201cperiod of achievement in which the Church seems to have conquered the world and is able to create a Christian culture and new forms of life and art and thought.\u201d Each age ends with decay and pressure from without and within.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mention Dawson, but George Weigel\u2019s new book, The Irony of Modern Catholic History, might be considered a history of Dawson\u2019s Sixth Age of the Church. The perky subtitle, \u201cHow the Church Rediscovered Itself and Challenged the Modern World to Reform,\u201d might sound like Catholic triumphalism, but the past-tense formulations are significant. \u201cRediscovered\u201d implies truths covered over during the period before. \u201cChallenged\u201d hints at the possibility that the contemporary Catholic Church has entered a phase of decline and decay.\n\nWeigel\u2019s history is a drama divided into five \u201cacts\u201d in which the Church deals with modernity, that multi-faceted transformation of societies that included political, social, technological, and cultural changes. Conventional histories portray a stupid and stubborn Catholic Church standing athwart history yelling \u201cStop\u201d \u2014 to all of it. This is a partial truth. Weigel presents the story as Catholicism\u2019s journey from reaction to a stance that was \u201cmore coherent, less defensive, and more influential in shaping the course of world affairs.\u201d As with all Weigel\u2019s writing, this story is well told \u2014 richly illustrated with lively anecdotes, cogent summaries of complex ideas, and revealing quotations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeigel begins, as Dawson\u2019s Sixth Age does, with the French Revolution, which smashed the inherited wealth and privilege of a Church that had lost its Counter-Reformation fervor and had settled into a \u201cdesultory\u201d intellectual life characterized by a leadership with a \u201cdulled\u201d imagination and by clergy and monastics more interested in sinecures than in the care of souls. Altars had become less important than the thrones that made service at them very comfortable.\n\nWeigel somewhat flattens the picture here. As the historian Ulrich Lehner\u2019s book The Catholic Enlightenment (2016) showed, alongside the cynics and sloths, serious Catholic intellectuals of the period attempted to do justice to Catholic tradition and modern understanding. But the Revolution\u2019s violence and Napoleon\u2019s kidnapping of Popes Pius VI (1775\u201399) and Pius VII (1800\u201323) caused a papal reaction that was stern yet successful. By Pius VII\u2019s death, the papacy, thought in 1800 to be finished, seemed like \u201ca moral authority supported by popular sentiment and respect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Gregory XVI (1831\u201346) and Pius IX (1846\u201378) we see a magnification of this reaction and the beginning of the modern papacy, with its pilgrimages to Rome and personal devotion to the pope. Both popes took largely reactionary political positions but also made strides in presenting the Church\u2019s human side. Gregory condemned Catholic Poles for revolting against their Russian overlords but also condemned slavery and the slave trade. Pius, whose initial instinct was to find a modus vivendi with the new world, was mugged by the revolutions of 1848. His papal documents, especially the 1864 encyclical Quanta Cura and its appendix, the Syllabus of Errors, pushed back hard, though not always wisely, against modernity. His rejection of the omnicompetent state seemed attended by a notion of an omnicompetent papacy, something perhaps encouraged by the First Vatican Council\u2019s declaration of papal infallibility and supreme and universal Church jurisdiction. This emphasis on and teaching about papal authority did, however, keep the transnational and universal understanding of the Church at the forefront.\n\nLeo XIII (1878\u20131903), one of Weigel\u2019s heroes, \u201cgingerly explored\u201d modernity with new energy and changes in emphasis. He encouraged study of the Bible in original languages with (some) modern methods. He promoted Thomas Aquinas\u2019s texts and, particularly, Aquinas\u2019s understanding that true freedom needed to be grounded in the truth of the human being as opposed to mere will. He encouraged Catholics to think \u201con the new things,\u201d as he titled his groundbreaking 1891 encyclical (Rerum Novarum), with sophistication. Thus modern Catholic social teaching began with an emphasis on justice as more than freedom of contract but also with a declaration of limits on the powers of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it had hitches (Pius X\u2019s iron-fisted pontificate), Leo\u2019s revolution largely succeeded, leading to the next dramatic act: the Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365). Weigel argues for its necessity \u2014 despite the lack of a burning doctrinal issue or Church crisis to call it forth \u2014 and its success. The 16 documents it produced are orthodox, filled with a new kind of evangelical fervor, and largely successful, in his view, at proposing Catholic faith in ways both traditional and modern, teaching Catholic dogmas without a \u201cdogmatic\u201d manner. The Council\u2019s winsome focus on Christ himself proposed to answer the human search for freedom and truth that modernity claimed to seek. It made a case for religious freedom on distinctly Catholic grounds and for a principled pluralism in public life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven on Weigel\u2019s telling, however, one might question Vatican II\u2019s success. First, the \u201cPastoral Constitution on the Modern World\u201d (Gaudium et Spes), the most direct attempt to address the modern situation, was, as Weigel acknowledges, a mixed success at best. In addition to latching onto the notion of global overpopulation and other myths, it depicted a \u201cmodern world\u201d that was already passing away in 1965. Second, the Council documents as a whole didn\u2019t have a \u201ckey\u201d to reading them. Without concrete doctrines to be believed or anathematized, their beautiful but sometimes imprecise language came to seem a charter for radical liturgical, doctrinal, and moral changes made in the name of an amorphous \u201cspirit of the Council.\u201d There was no \u201ckey\u201d proposed until 1985\u2019s Extraordinary Synod of Bishops \u2014 a bit late. These points might make one ask whether the Council itself was timed right. Ten years later, the assembled bishops might have judged the \u201cmodern world\u201d more soberly and left less textual ambiguity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeigel\u2019s next two acts can thus be read as either a fulfillment or a partial correction of the somewhat na\u00efve Vatican II \u201cembrace of modernity.\u201d John Paul II and Benedict XVI are the heroes of this period. The pair, through their papal and personal writings and speeches, made clear in the fourth act that the good things of modernity could be enjoyed only if a healthy public culture sustained political and economic life, reason was grounded in metaphysical reality, and freedom was treated not as the ability to choose anything but as the duty to choose the good. The irony was that, long seen as the enemy of modernity, the Church was proposing a way to save it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fifth act (our own), in which an \u201cEvangelical Catholicism\u201d stands as a public witness to truth (without uniting altar and throne), Weigel labels \u201cCatholicism Converting Modernity.\u201d But he ends, ironically, somewhat mournfully. The Church, now with the intellectual wherewithal to provide this public witness, is mired in 1) yet more revelations of sexual-abuse cover-ups and 2) in a papacy that even Weigel (who in his writings rarely criticizes Francis directly) admits seems to be \u201cencouraging\u201d both \u201cconfusion\u201d and the \u201cdeconstruction of doctrine\u201d that is still pervasive in Catholic life.\n\nWe might take a different view, then, of this fifth act. Perhaps it is more properly seen as the final act of Dawson\u2019s Sixth Age. In addition to the decay Weigel chronicles, the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in world affairs now pales compared with what it was in 1948, when Jacques Maritain helped draft the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, or in the 1980s, when John Paul challenged the Soviet Union. The 1980s perhaps also marked the end of a midcentury Catholic revival in literature and the arts.\n\nCatholics might be not in a \u201cFranciscan stall,\u201d a pause in the advancing conversion of modernity, but rather in the death throes of an age that reached its apogee in the middle of the last century. Catholicism in a Seventh Age will no doubt learn from this age\u2019s engagement with and critique of modernity, but it may also operate in a different way. It may return to earlier models of more-traditional liturgy, more-exact conciliar speech, and a view of the Church in which the popes are important but not the main protagonists. Of necessity, it may also see the Church step back temporarily from the public role it assumed in this age until it better orders its own house. Conversion, like judgment, begins with the house of God (1 Peter 4:17).", "description": "A review of 'The Irony of Modern Catholic History: How the Church Rediscovered Itself & Challenged the Modern World to Reform,' by George Weigel", "authors": ["David P.
