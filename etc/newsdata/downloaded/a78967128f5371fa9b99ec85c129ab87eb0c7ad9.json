Erdogan did not address that criticism, instead insisting that Rouhani had a duty to keep Iranians from criticizing Turkey.\n\nErdogan made the comments before boarding a flight to Sochi, Russia, where he will meet with counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d\n\nBoth Iran and Russia are close allies of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who loudly opposes any Turkish presence in his country. Erdogan has previously stated that the Turkish military\u2019s only goal in Syria is to \u201cend the rule of the tyrant Assad, who terrorizes with state terror.\u201d He has since changed his tune, claiming that the Syrian Kurdish forces, the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ), are a threat to the Turkish homeland. Ankara considers the YPG \u2014 U.S. allies who were indispensable to the fight against the Islamic State \u2014 indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d began after President Donald Trump ordered the removal of U.S. troops from Rojava, prompting Kurds to call the move a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d Kurdish locals pelted withdrawing American troops with tomatoes and trash as they drove out of northern Syrian cities this week.\n\nAssad repeated his demands that Turkish troops leave Syrian soil on Tuesday.\n\nAsked about criticism from Iran, Erdogan said, \u201cSome of the statements about the operation have caused serious sadness to me, of course these voices are outside the [Iranian] government and we will pursue this issue seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot [President] Rouhani himself but some of his close friends have issued oppositional statements \u2026 Mr. Rouhani should have prevented these statements,\u201d he added. Erdogan said that Iran should not \u201cforget\u201d Turkey\u2019s stance in support of Iran\u2019s illegal nuclear weapons development.\n\n\u201cThe approach that has been adopted today (by Turkey) and the secret agreements that have been made would not benefit the region,\u201d Rouhani said on the first day of the Turkish invasion, \u201cand we call on our friend and brother, Turkey, and its government, to be more careful and have more patience in such affairs and reconsider the path that has been chosen.\u201d\n\nRudaw, a Kurdish news publication, added that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif also criticized Erdogan, urging the Turkish president on Twitter to \u201cend the incursion into Syria.\u201d The Iranian Foreign Ministry also issued an official condemnation of the invasion through its regular press briefing on Monday.\n\nAssad himself has aggressively condemned Turkey for invading Syria. In remarks paraphrased for his official media outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), Assad accused Turkey of \u201cexternal greed\u201d and making \u201ccriminal moves\u201d to take over Syria.\n\n\u201cIt is a blatant invasion and a clear aggression to which Syria has responded it in many places through striking its agents and terrorists, and Syria will respond and confront it with all its forms in any region of Syrian territory through all available legitimate means,\u201d Assad reportedly said last week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Assad openly accused Erdogan not of seeking to eradicate the Kurds \u2014 who have accused Erdogan of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 but of looting Syria\u2019s natural resources.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish president has stolen oil and wheat from Syria and also took factories away from Aleppo, and now [Tayyip] Erdogan wants to steal part of Syrian soil with its natural resources,\u201d Russian news agency TASS quoted Assad as saying.\n\nSANA, Assad\u2019s news agency, also repeated accusations on Tuesday that Turkish soldiers are using banned chemical weapons against civilians in northern Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella group largely including Kurdish fighters, claimed it had evidence of the use of phosphorus and unknown chemicals to burn children in Rojava last week. It also accused Erdogan of cooperating with the Islamic State to form an \u201cOttoman Khalifa [caliphate].\u201d\n\nA study published in February found evidence that Assad used illegal chemical weapons at least 300 times during the span of the eight-year-old Syrian Civil War.\n\nErdogan will arrive in Sochi to meet Assad\u2019s and Rouhani\u2019s main ally, Putin, on Tuesday. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the talks will be \u201clong and complicated\u201d and require patience, as Erdogan and Putin find themselves on opposite sides of the ongoing invasion.\n\n\u201cRussia wants to discuss the situation in northeastern Syria in order to better understand the events and get information about Turkey\u2019s plans and compare it with general plans on promoting political settlement in Syria,\u201d Peskov told reporters.\n\nErdogan told reporters he hoped for \u201cvery substantial opportunities\u201d to come out of the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to increase our cooperation with Russia. Up to now, also with the contribution of Iran, we have been able to bring peace to the field, and we have worked hard to bring stability to Syria,\u201d the Turkish president said.\n\nRudaw notes that the \u201cpeace\u201d Erdogan has brought to Syria has killed at least 200 people and triggered a refugee wave of at least 300,000, most seeking to reach Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nErdogan noted that discussions with America have been productive, but French President Emmanuel Macron has tried to participate in negotiations without finding a constructive role to play. He accused Macron of meeting with \u201cterrorists\u201d (Kurds) and said he is looking to \u201cmake a place for himself in this agreement.\u201d\n\nTurkey and the SDF are currently abiding by a U.S.-brokered ceasefire set to end on Wednesday. The SDF has repeatedly accused Turkey of violating the ceasefire, including using chemical weapons during the ceasefire timeframe.\n\nSDF spokesman Kino Gabriel told Rudaw the force wishes to abide by the ceasefire but will defend itself if Turkey violates the agreement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can be sure [of the ceasefire continuing]. This is related to the Turkish government and to what extent it adheres to it,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWe could expect the continuation of military operations as Turkey, based on the statements of Turkish officials starting from the Turkish president to the minister of defense and others, speak of the necessity of completing military operations in Syria.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he felt \"serious sadness\" at criticism against his country's invasion of Syria from Iran.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Recip-Tayyip-Erdogan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
