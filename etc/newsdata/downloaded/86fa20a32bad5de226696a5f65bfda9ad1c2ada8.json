He persisted in pressing Ukraine to commit to Trump\u2019s demands, convening a second meeting even after a spectacular blowup in the West Wing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Two-Volatile-Meetings-At-The-White-House-Have-Become-Central-To-The-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
