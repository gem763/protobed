Mr. Rogers is currently the chief executive of Argos, a British electronics and furniture retailer that belongs to supermarket chain J Sainsbury PLC. Before his role at Argos, Mr. Rogers served as Sainsbury\u2019s finance chief from 2010 to 2016.\n\nHe will be taking over the finances at WPP at the start of 2020, the company said.\n\nMr. Rogers\u2019s appointment marks the end of Mr. Richardson\u2019s long tenure as WPP\u2019s finance director, which began in 1996. Mr. Richardson was crucial to executing the growth strategy that the company pursued under former chief executive Martin Sorrell, analysts said.\n\nMr. Sorrell stepped down as WPP chief executive in April 2018 and was succeeded by Mark Read, another longtime executive at the company, the following September.\n\n\u201cMark [Read] does things differently and wanted a different face [as CFO],\u201d said Tim Nollen, a senior analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. New CEOs usually name their own finance chiefs, especially when facing a turnaround or significant strategic shift, recruiters said.\n\nSince the change in WPP\u2019s leadership, the company has focused on reorganizing its business and has divested some assets, including the sale of 60% of its stake in Kantar Group, a market research firm.\n\nThe sale will help WPP reduce its debt to the lower end of a target range of 1.5 times to 1.75 times average net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the company said in July. WPP\u2019s net debt was \u00a34.96 billion ($6.10 billion) in 2018, and the ratio between average net debt and Ebitda was 2.1 times, the company said in its latest annual report.\n\nThe company needs to focus on reigniting growth, Mr. Nollen said. Advertising agencies like WPP have struggled with a growing ability among their clients to manage more advertising tasks themselves.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of data and a lot of marketing software out there that did not exist a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Nollen said. Advertising firms must show how they remain relevant for their clients, he said.\n\nWPP should respond to this challenge by breaking down some of its internal silos and by responding faster to customers\u2019 changing demands, said Ian Whittaker, head of European media research at Liberum Capital Ltd., an investment bank.\n\nMr. Rogers\u2019s experience at Argos could assist with that, said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. At Argos, Mr. Rogers focused on advancing the retailer\u2019s digital transformation, resulting in around 65% of sales coming through its website.\n\n\u201cJohn is not only an accomplished CFO, but also a leader with extensive experience of business transformation,\u201d Mr. Read said in a statement. \u201cHis priority will be to lead a finance function that best fosters investment in creativity, technology and talent in support of WPP\u2019s new strategy for growth,\u201d he said.\n\nAs WPP CFO, Mr. Rogers is entitled to an annual salary of \u00a3740,000 alongside an annual bonus opportunity of up to 225% of his base salary, plus other compensation, WPP said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "WPP PLC hired a successor to longtime finance chief Paul Richardson, a move that comes as the London-based advertising group looks to reignite growth and respond to changing customer demands.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112720/social", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
