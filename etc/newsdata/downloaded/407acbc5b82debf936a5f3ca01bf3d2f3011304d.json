But lucky for those left baffled by the mistake, Colorado\u2019s governor had a pretty perfect response.\n\n\u201cWell this is awkward,\u201d Gov. Jared Polis tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cColorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico. Good thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s geographical flub happened during a speech in Pittsburgh on Wednesday at an oil and gas conference. \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, you can\u2019t get under,\u201d Trump told a cheering crowd. \u201cAnd we\u2019re building a wall in Texas. And we\u2019re not building a wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned.\u201d\n\nColorado, by the way, is around 450 miles north of the border with Mexico. By comparison, the shortest driving distance between San Francisco and Los Angeles is 383 miles.\n\nAlso Read: Trump's Lawyer Argues President Can't Be Prosecuted While in Office, Even If He Shoots Someone\n\nOther political figures dunked on Trump for the mistake as well. Like Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette, who referenced Trump\u2019s earlier campaign promises that Mexico would pay for a border wall (it\u2019s not) by asking on Twitter \u201cIs NEW Mexico going to pay for it?\u201d\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy offered a more visual response, inspired by \u201cSharpiegate,\u201d when Trump presented a doctored map of Hurricane Dorian to make it appear as if the hurricane would impact Alabama:\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/fmE0hiPLNB pic.twitter.com/gMzNIcl5Qu\n\n\u2014 Sen.
