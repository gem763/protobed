(AP) - Patrick Mahomes has won games for the Kansas City Chiefs without Sammy Watkins and Tyreek Hill, without a bell-cow running back or a defense capable of stopping just about anyone.\n\nHe proved it once more on Sunday.\n\nWith star wide receiver Tyreek Hill sidelined by a broken collarbone, and left tackle Eric Fisher on the sideline with a groin injury, the reigning league MVP merely threw four touchdown passes - all in one dynamic quarter - in the Chiefs\u2018 28-10 victory over the Oakland Raiders.\n\nOh, and Mahomes did it all while nursing an ankle sprained in a Week 1 rout of Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a quarterback,\u201d Raiders cornerback Lamarcus Joyner said. \u201cHe got a little Tom Brady to him, a little Drew Brees look, a little Philip Rivers. He\u2019ll challenge you. He can make the throws. He can scramble around, so I mean, you have to cover a little bit longer.\u201d\n\nThe big question now is whether the Chiefs can continue to rely on their third-year star.\n\nHill will be gone for at least another month, and nobody is quite sure whether Fisher\u2019s groin injury will keep him out long. LeSean McCoy was due to have an MRI exam on his ankle on Monday, while fellow running back Damien Williams is dealing with a knee injury.\n\nMahomes had wide receiver Demarcus Robinson come up big in Oakland, but the job doesn\u2019t get a whole lot easier as the Chiefs return home for their first game at Arrowhead Stadium. The Ravens are coming to town for a game that could have playoff implications come the end of the season.\n\nNot that anybody in Kansas City is looking that far into the future.\n\nFor many of the Chiefs, they\u2019re content to marvel at the here and now - especially when it comes to their record-setting quarterback and his jaw-dropping ability.\n\n\u201cListen, I never take it for granted,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cSome of these throws, I\u2019ve told you this before, some of these throws he makes, you just say, \u2018All right,\u2019 and buzz right through it. Like it happens every day, it kind of does happen. That\u2019s what makes him unique, and the fact that he\u2019s willing to continue to work on his game the way he does is also very important.\n\n\u201cIn this league if you let off an inch, then you\u2019re going to fall,\u201d Reid added. \u201cHe stays right on top of that in everything that he does.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Chiefs\u2018 rebuilt defense under new coordinator Steve Spagnuolo took a big step forward after a mediocre opening game against the Jaguars. After a few blown assignments allowed Oakland to take a 10-0 lead, the Chiefs basically shut down the Raiders the rest of the way.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe running game struggled with McCoy and Williams hobbled in Oakland. Mahomes can minimize a lot of issues on offense, but the Chiefs need some semblance of a run game to keep teams honest. And if the top two backs are out against Oakland, it will fall on Darrell Williams and Darwin Thompson.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nRobinson caught all six passes thrown to him for 172 yards and two touchdowns, giving the Chiefs another sure-handed wide receiver with Hill out for the next few weeks. Teams will need to begin paying attention to him, and that could open up things for Watkins and tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nThe Chiefs\u2018 defensive line struggled at times against Oakland\u2019s front, though part of that was due to the exceptional play of rooking running back Josh Jacobs. But stopping the run was an issue last year, and so far the problem still exists.\n\nINJURED\n\nThe big loss in Oakland was Fisher, who actually hurt his groin late in the week and tried to play on Sunday. Cam Erving moved over to replace him in the lineup and fared well, but Fisher - an ex-No. 1 overall draft pick - has developed into one of the top left tackles in the NFL.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n209 - The number of wins for coach Andy Reid, who moved into a tie with Chuck Noll for sixth in NFL history. Next on the list is Curly Lambeau with 229 victories.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAfter going coast to coast to pick up road wins to open the season, the Chiefs finally head home for a game at Arrowhead Stadium. The Ravens are also off to a 2-0 start, and along with the Patriots, the two teams meeting Sunday have emerged as the class of the AFC early this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes has won games for the Kansas City Chiefs without Sammy Watkins and Tyreek Hill, without a bell-cow running back or a defense capable of stopping just about anyone.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/chiefs_raiders_football_47601_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
