This is not simply a revolting development but a deeply troubling one that will only accelerate the ongoing loss of confidence and trust the public has in media. According to polling done for the Columbia Journalism Review, fewer than 20 percent of us have a \u201cgreat deal of confidence\u201d in the press. The only institution held in lower esteem is Congress.\n\nYet the media seem happy to keep digging their own grave. Yesterday, for instance, The New York Times reported on what it called a \u201cmacabre video of [a] fake Trump shooting media and critics\u201d that was shown at a conference held at one of the president\u2019s own properties (Trump had nothing to do with the conference or the video, which the White House has condemned). You\u2019d assume the paper would link to or embed the video in support of its characterization. But it refused to, even as it\u2019s safe to say that it was the Times\u2019 coverage that helped bring the video to a large viewing audience (that\u2019s how I learned about it)\u2026\n\nThe actions of the Times, Meet the Press, and the New Zealand media will not slow the loss of confidence and trust in the media. On the contrary, such behavior will accelerate it as readers continue to rebel against such paternalism by searching out alternative sources of information (including many shady, conspiracist sites). There\u2019s already a widespread belief, some or much it justified, that powerful elites hold most Americans in various forms of contempt. Simultaneously telling those same readers, viewers, and listeners that big, important, scary things are happening and then withholding primary sources is a perfect recipe to increase cynicism and anger toward the media.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nick Gillespie", "Reason.Com The-New-York-Times-Nbc-And-Other-Outlets-Dont-Trust-You-To-Handle-The-Truth"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
