This is due to its attractive semi-rural setting, family-friendly amenities and community-minded population.\n\n\n\nThe European School, Luxembourg II, on the neighborhood\u2019s border with the town of Bertrange, is a multilingual private school that offers the European Baccalaureate qualification, has increased its allure, particularly with expats and as a result has become more cosmopolitan.\n\nMore: Grosse Pointe Farms: An Old-Timey Small-Town in Detroit\n\nBoundaries\n\nMamer, one of Luxembourg\u2019s 102 municipalities, sits to the west of Luxembourg city center and covers 27 square kilometers. It has, as previously mentioned, the A6 motorway running through it, as well as a railway line and the N6 road, another artery linking Luxembourg City to the Belgian border.\n\n\n\nMamer, Holzem and Capellen are the area\u2019s three main villages. Mamer is the largest and sits to the east of the municipality. Holzem lies to the south and Capellen is positioned in its northwest corner.\n\nThe area is mostly formed of forest, woodland and open fields and it features the southern end of the hilly Mamer River valley. Its southern border lies just north of the E44 road, its western and northern borders cross through countryside and Rue de Mamer lies on its eastern side.\n\nPrice Range\n\n\n\nPrices are high in the city center because of demand and a lack of stock, which makes areas on its fringes, such as Mamer appealing. Values here are about 30% to 50% lower than in the city center, according to Christophe Muller, director of sales at Luxembourg Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\n\n\nFrom July 2018 to June 2019, the average sales price of a house was \u20ac1,192,373 (US$1,325,817 million) or \u20ac5,163 per square meter while the average sales price of an apartment was \u20ac784,085 or \u20ac7,130 per square meter, according to the Habitat Observatory, a department of the Ministry of Housing in Luxembourg.\n\n\n\nThe most popular price range at the upper end of the market in Mamer, however, is between \u20ac1.5 million and \u20ac2.3 million, according to Mr. Filipe Rebelo, a real estate agent at Engel & Volkers Luxembourg.\n\nFor this price, buyers would get a modern family home in good condition with four bedrooms and a garden, he added. It is possible to buy a detached house for \u20ac1 million, but it will probably need some work, according to Mr. Rebelo and Mr. Muller, who add that some homes can cost as much as \u20ac4.5 million.\n\n\n\nMore: Muthaiga is Nairobi\u2019s Most-Affluent Neighborhood, Offering Privacy and Lush Landscapes\n\nFrom July 2018 to June 2019, existing apartments sold for between \u20ac4,235 per square meter and \u20ac7,516 per square meter, while new apartments sold for between \u20ac6,391 per square meter and \u20ac8,306 per square meter, according to the Habitat Observatory.\n\n\n\nOne of the most expensive homes currently on the market is a former mill building dating to the 1420s set on 19 acres of land.

Most land-buying opportunities are snapped up by developers rather than private owners.\n\n\n\nMost new homes are terraced family homes and apartments and they tend to be located in Mamer village on secondary roads off the A6 motorway for ease of access.
