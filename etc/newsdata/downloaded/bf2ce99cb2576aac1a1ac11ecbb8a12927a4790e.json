The books have always told us that they knew Abbey Road was their last album and they wanted to go out on an artistic high. But no - they're discussing the next album. And you think that John is the one who wanted to break them up but, when you hear this, he isn't. Doesn't that rewrite pretty much everything we thought we knew?\"\n\nA billboard for The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" album in Los Angeles in 1969.

All down the line, people have liked my songs.\"\n\nThe newly uncovered tape is a part of Lewisohn's upcoming stage show Hornsey Road, which will see him tell the story of \"Abbey Road\" 50 years on using tape, film, photos, new audio mixes of the music, and his own anecdotes and memorabilia.\n\nIn it, the historian will seek to change the perception that the Beatles were at odds throughout 1969.\n\n\"They were in an almost entirely positive frame of mind,\" he said of their time recording \"Abbey Road.\"\n\n\"They had this uncanny ability to leave their problems at the studio door - not entirely, but almost.\"", "description": "Rock historian Mark Lewisohn gave The Guardian access to the tape, which was recorded 50 years ago this week.", "authors": ["Alison Millington"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78e3d8f4fc240ae878cbd1-480-240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
