These are the early-bird buyers of two limited edition Vantage AMRs, first deliveries of which are about to be made.\n\nOf these, just 59 special editions called \u2018Vantage 59\u2019 and costing \u00a3164,995 in a special Stirling Green and Lime exterior paintwork, a Dark Knight and alcantara interior trim, and finished with a signature AMR lime stripe and stitch, have been created to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Aston Martin\u2019s historic win with a DBR1 in the 1959 Le Mans 24 hour race.\n\nThe remaining 141 of the first run of 200 - costing from \u00a3149,995 - will be available in a choice Sabiro Blue, Onyx Black, China Grey or White Stone. Only a few of these remain.\n\nAnd from next year, all buyers of new Vantages will be able to specify a seven-speed manual option \u2013 with around 1 in 10 customers expected to do so.\n\nDriving it requires a little adaption however.\n\nThis is a powerful beast with a 4.0 litre 510 horse-power twin turbo V8 engine with scintillating acceleration from rest to 60mph in just 3.9 seconds, around 0.4 seconds slower than the automatic.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to get any thanks from green groups like Extinction Rebellion. It\u2019ll manage only 25.7mpg with hefty CO2 emissions of 268g/km.\n\nRay got to grips with the Aston Martin Vantage AMR in slippery conditions\n\nOf the run of 200 first edition cars, 141 - costing from \u00a3149,995 - will be available in a choice Sabiro Blue (pictured), Onyx Black, China Grey or White Stone. Only a few of these remain.\n\nThe marginal loss of pace in comparison to the automatic is more than made up for by the enhanced feeling of really driving the manual car that creates the added excitement, engagement and exhilaration.\n\nIn the eight-speed auto you simply set it to \u2018drive\u2019 and \u2013 unless feeling like a more engaging play on the manual override paddles on the steering wheel \u2013 let the car do the rest. It\u2019s a fine and exciting experience. But some people want more.\n\nWith the seven-speed manual transmission developed by Dana Graziano you need to do more work.\n\nOf course there\u2019s an extra third pedal \u2013 the clutch. But here\u2019s the twist. It has a \u2018dog-leg\u2019 first gear.\n\nThat means instead of pressing the clutch and pushing the gear \u2018up\u2019 to first \u2013 as it traditional on most manuals \u2013 you actually pull the hand-stiched leather clad gear-stick \u2018down\u2019 to first to get yourself on your way.\n\nThe reverse \u2018R\u2019 gear is actually where first gear usually is.\n\nThis emulates classic racing gears. The idea is that, once you\u2019ve got moving, it is second to seventh gears that you will use most. And it is these that are set in the traditional \u2018double-H\u2019 pattern.\n\nIt has a \u2018dog-leg\u2019 first gear. That means instead of pressing the clutch and pushing the gear \u2018up\u2019 to first \u2013 as it traditional on most manuals \u2013 you actually pull the hand-stitched leather clad gear-stick \u2018down\u2019 to first to get yourself on your way.\n\nFor those who want the full-blooded Aston racing colours, this is an option also - but comes at a premium\n\nIn truth, it takes a little getting used to \u2013 a bit like going back to your days as a learner driver. I was probably a little too timid to begin with and over-thinking it.\n\nHowever, once you let go and trust your instincts to change gear on feel and engine sound, it all starts to make sense.\n\nI was reminded of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s advice to Luke Skywalker in Star Wars \u2013 just feel the force and go with it. It works. And there\u2019s a wonderful exhaust soundtrack to go alongside.\n\nOnce settled in, I was bowled over by the fun factor. You do really engage with this car.\n\nMy drive took place on public roads around the legendary Nurburgring circuit in the Eifel region of Germany between the Rivers Rhine and Moselle \u2013 though not actually on the track itself.\n\nA bit of a downpour at one stage made the roads very wet and slippery. But the car coped well and at one stage I felt the active safety system kick in momentarily to mitigate a skittery bit of twitch.\n\nVery advanced drivers \u2013 especially on the track - may choose to turn all those helpful aids, but frankly I\u2019m always glad of them.\n\nAgain for advanced drivers there\u2019s a special 'AMSHIFT\u2019 system which uses the clutch, gear-position, prop-shaft sensors, and the engine management programme to mimic the technique of \u2018heel and toe\u2019 downshifts.\n\nThe 59 special edition \u2018Vantage 59\u2019 cost \u00a3164,995 and are finished in a Stirling Green and Lime exterior paintwork and a Dark Knight and alcantara interior trim\n\nRay confirmed there\u2019s no flip-top on the manual gear stick with which to reveal a button to activate a passenger ejector seat, as on the original DB5 from the 007 movie Goldfinger\n\nThis is the act of blipping the throttle while braking and changing gear to allow smoother deceleration and cornering. It also allows shifting up a gear at full throttle to maximise smoothness with minimal loss of acceleration.\n\nThe Vantage AMR manual transmission has been specially engineered by Aston Martin\u2019s leading dynamics team, headed by chief engineer Matt Becker, from the team\u2019s base at Silverstone Race Circuit.\n\nRemoving the automatic transmission and including carbon ceramic brakes as standard removes 95kg of weight helping create a purer, more rewarding and engaging driver experience and the much desired 50:50 balance of weight to help handling.\n\nAston Martin has recently revealed pictures of a prototype of its Vantage Roadster which is also expected to be offered with a seven-speed manual option after it arrives in showrooms just in time for the sunshine next Spring.\n\nOther than the fabric top, the car is expected to have the same engine and other specifications as the coupe version. But the price will be in excess of the \u00a3120,900 base price for the coupe version \u2013 and closer to \u00a3130,000.\n\nOne disappointment from the maker of James Bond\u2019s favourite car.\n\nThere\u2019s no flip-top on the manual gear stick with which to reveal a button to activate a passenger ejector seat, as on the original DB5 from the 007 movie Goldfinger.\n\nCan\u2019t have everything, I suppose.
