He\u2019s a hot topic because of the price tag. Because of his status in his national team, and his world status through that. And everyone has got a little bit carried away with the short term.\n\n\u2018The long term is that he\u2019s come here and he\u2019s just turned 21 and to see him play like he did today, and there\u2019s a lot more to come.\n\nMarcos Alonso scored Chelsea\u2019s winning goal in their 1-0 victory over Newcastle (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not the end story.
