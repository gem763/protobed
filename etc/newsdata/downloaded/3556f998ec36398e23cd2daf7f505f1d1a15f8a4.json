They reveal that, while students know more about university-sponsored resources for victims of sexual assault and misconduct, they still aren't using these resources often enough,\" she added.\n\nFor example, compared with the results of the 2015 survey, there was an increase of 11.5 to 36.9 percent for undergraduate women and 12.4 to 40.3 percent for undergraduate men when it comes to understanding the definition of sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\n\nAlthough 65.6 percent of the students said it was \"very\" or \"extremely likely\" that school officials would take a report of a sexual assault seriously, only 45 percent of those who reported nonconsensual sexual contact believed that was the case.\n\nThe survey also found that there was a slight increase in sexual assaults from 2015 to 2019, including an increase of 3 percent for undergraduate women, 2.4 percent for graduate and professional women, and 1.4 percent for undergraduate men.\n\nThe University of Southern California, which has been rocked by controversies related to alleged sexual assaults by a former campus gynecologist, reported that in the 2019 survey, 20.5 percent of undergraduate students have experienced at least one incident of nonconsensual sexual contact involving physical force, compared with 19.3 percent in 2015.\n\nIn addition, 31 percent of female undergraduates, 10.2 percent of male undergraduates and 26.1 percent of TQGN students reported having such an experience in the school's 2019 survey.\n\n\"We are sharing these results with the campus community to confirm that we are committed to addressing this issue head-on in our efforts to build a community that is safe and protects our wellbeing,\" wrote Dr Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer at USC, and Winston B. Crisp, vice president of student affairs, in a letter to the school community Tuesday.\n\nStanford said 38.5 percent of undergraduate female students who have attended the school for four years or more have experienced some form of nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force. About 80 percent of perpetrators of nonconsensual sexual contact were other Stanford students.\n\n\"I am deeply troubled by many of the survey findings, as I'm sure you will be. We continue to see the prevalence of sexual assault and sexual harassment on our campus, and there is clear evidence that some groups of students are particularly affected at higher rates than others,\" wrote university Provost Persis S. Drell in a letter to students.\n\nAt the University of Madison-Wisconsin, the survey found that 26.1 percent of undergraduate women at the school reported experiencing some form of sexual assault; 11 percent reported experiencing assault by penetration.\n\n\"We're committed to doing all we can to ensure a safe living and learning environment. When sexual assault occurs, we will respond swiftly and with compassion, providing resources and support. Together, we can reduce sexual violence,\" wrote the school's chancellor, Becky Blank, on her Twitter page Tuesday.", "description": "One in four undergraduate female students at leading research universities across the country have been subjected to nonconsensual sexual contact, a national survey concluded Tuesday, raising alarm for educators about the prevalence of sexual violence on campus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/17/5da7491da310cf3e97a19037.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
