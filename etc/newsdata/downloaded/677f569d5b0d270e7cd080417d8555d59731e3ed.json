The new function will come with Bitcoin.com\u2019s preinstalled wallet and be rolled into the Exodus 1 software update. Bitcoin.com will also sell the Exodus 1 and all future versions.\n\nIn a statement, HTC\u2019s chief decentralization officer Phil Chen called the update a natural next step for the phone. \u201cThe Zion Vault is happy to support BCH natively in hardware so security goes hand-in-hand in the BCH blockchain as an alternative to dominant payment rails and platforms,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the partnership, Zion Vault, the phone\u2019s key management software can now secure BCH transfers by signing off on transactions.\n\nPrior to last February, HTC only accepted major cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum. As of now, the phone is priced at $699.\n\nFirst announced at Consenses 2018, HTC has regularly updated the Exodus 1 with new blockchain features. An update in May allowed users to directly swap cryptocurrencies within the Zion Vault wallet.\n\nExodus 1 may soon be replaced by HTC\u2019s second-generation blockchain phone: the newer, cheaper Exodus 1s. Chen has previously told CoinDesk that the $200-$300 phone would ship in the third quarter.\n\nHTC Exodus image courtesy HTC", "description": "HTC has partnered with Bitcoin.com to add bitcoin cash support to its EXODUS 1 phone, the Taiwanese phone manufacturer announced Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Exodus_PDP-Hero_BG_2560x874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
