G20 finance ministers stated:\n\n\u201cSuch risks, including in particular those related to money laundering, illicit finance, and consumer and investor protection, need to be evaluated and appropriately addressed before these projects can commence operation.\u201d\n\nBank of Japan\u2019s Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that the G20 summit will begin with a debate regarding stablecoin regulations \u2014 following proposals from global regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board and the Financial Action Task Force. Kuroda stated:\n\n\u201cSome emerging countries have concerns on what could happen if stablecoins backed by a huge customer base become widely used globally [...] But this is not just a problem for emerging economies. It could have a broader impact on monetary policy and financial system stability.\u201d\n\nStablecoin concerns multiply among major economies\n\nThe news follows a recent report by the G7 task force stating that stablecoins such as Facebook\u2019s Libra present a significant risk to the global financial system.\n\nIn the report requested by the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, the task force confirmed that the group of the seven wealthiest nations would not allow any global stablecoin to launch without addressing related challenges and risks.", "description": "G20 nations call upon the International Monetary Fund to examine the macroeconomic implications of global stablecoins", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZmRmZWU3YWI1ZGFmYzUxN2Q5ZTUyZjU5YjZjNmZjZmIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
