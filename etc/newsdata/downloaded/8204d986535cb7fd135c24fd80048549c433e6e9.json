It is the funeral of my friend and mentor, Justin Mamis.\n\nJustin was 90 years old.\n\nFor those of you who enjoy my work, you can thank Justin for much of it. He taught me how to put a pencil to the paper for my hand-drawn charts. He taught me about divergences, both positive and negative ones. He taught me how to spot a head-and-shoulders pattern, too!\n\nAnd he taught me how to avoid getting giddy at tops and too bearish at lows.\n\nJustin used to tell the story that he didn't know what he wanted to do when he graduated from Yale in the 1950s, so he took a job at the track, taking bets on horses. He had inherited some money and gave it to one of his classmates, who had gone to work on Wall Street. The classmate promptly lost the money and Justin figured he could have done that all on his own. So, Justin decided he would study the markets. While working the betting window, he read Robert D. Edwards' and John Magee's book, \"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends\" and started hand-posting his own charts.\n\nHe eventually went to work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and, over time, moved \"upstairs\" to trade. Later, he, along with Stan Weinstein, founded The Professional Tape Reader in the early 1970s, though Justin sold out to Stan a few years later. From there, he moved to the sell side as a Technical Analyst. I met him in the early 1980s as I was starting my career.\n\nHe was a legend on Wall Street and wrote several books on the market; I was privileged to have helped him with one of them, \"The Nature of Risk.\"\n\nOne of Justin's best market calls came in October 1987. The week before the Crash of 1987, he and two other top technicians at the time, Ralph Acampora and Stan, were interviewed in Barron's. I still have the hard copy. Justin was the only bear among them, looking for a 15%-20% decline.\n\nHe will be missed.\n\nI will be back at my desk on Wednesday.", "description": "Justin Mamis, the man who taught me how to put a pencil to the paper for my hand-drawn charts, has died at age 90.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "Goodbye To A Wall Street Legend", "Justin Mamis", "The Man Who Taught Me How To Put A Pencil To The Paper For My Hand-Drawn Charts", "Has Died At Age", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Cramer", "Ed Ponsi", "James", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/af3cbaf0-cf1b-11e9-805f-51d2d91c816d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
