The U.K. Parliament will vote on the deal Saturday, but it is unclear if it will pass. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party has said that it will be unable to support the deal in Saturday's vote. If U.K. lawmakers approve the agreement, the EU's Parliament will also have to ratify the deal.\n\nBut the three-year uncertainty about fate of the U.K. has put pressure on British businesses and consumers. Coke, like many other companies, increased its U.K. inventory in case of a no-deal Brexit, which would mean leaving the EU without any kind of trade agreement.\n\n\"It would be fair to say that in the short term, the U.K. business has been impacted by the consumer sentiment, driven by Brexit in the U.K., which has affected everyone \u2014 the entire business outlook in the U.K.\" Quincey said.\n\nCoke announced its fiscal third-quarter results Friday. Its earnings were in line with analysts' estimates, while its revenue topped Wall Street's expectations, thanks to growing sales for healthier drink options.", "description": "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said that if U.K. lawmakers passes a Brexit deal, consumer sentiment will improve.", "authors": ["Amelia Lucas"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105697874-15483409743312i3a4595.jpg?v=1571406910", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
