That May he signed a seven-year $175-million extension, the largest contract for a pitcher who had undergone Tommy John elbow surgery.\n\nAgreeing to an extension made Strasburg a rarity among the clients of the agent Scott Boras, who prefers to test the open market for maximum leverage. But Strasburg wanted to remain in Washington, and that might be a factor this off-season when he weighs his right to exercise the first of two opt-outs in his contract. Since he signed the extension, Strasburg, his wife and two daughters have made Washington their off-season home.\n\n\u201cSince he\u2019s got here, Steve has had so much pressure and hype \u2014 almost unfairly \u2014 for what he was supposed to do in his career,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cAnd at the beginning of his career \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say he let it get to him, because only he can tell you that \u2014 it had to be hard to deal with. I can\u2019t imagine having that sort of pressure on you from Day 1.\u201d\n\nSeeing Strasburg laugh, dance and hug now, it is almost hard to remember those days. But he brushed off the notion that he was letting loose more than before.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty much the same to be honest,\u201d said Strasburg, who has a career 1.10 E.R.A. in 41 postseason innings. \u201cFrom the outside looking in, you can look at one thing. But you kind of just roll with what you\u2019ve got, and we have a lot of guys that like to have a lot of fun. I\u2019m not one to be the Debbie Downer here.\u201d", "description": "The Nationals\u2019 scheduled starter for Game 2 of the World Series has been a star for a long time, but he seems to be cutting loose and having more fun than ever before.", "authors": ["James Wagner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/sports/22strasburg01/22strasburg01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
