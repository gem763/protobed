REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nThe victory for the U.S. tech titan means that, while it must remove links to sensitive personal data from its internet search results in Europe when required, it does not have to scrap them from searches elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe case has been viewed as a landmark test, in an age of an internet that knows no borders, of whether people can demand a blanket removal of information about themselves from searches without stifling free speech and legitimate public interest.\n\nIt has also been seen by policymakers and companies around the world as a test of whether the European Union can extend its laws beyond its own borders.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject ... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,\u201d the Court of Justice of the European Union said in its ruling.\n\nGoogle welcomed the decision, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular internet search engine has previously warned of the dangers of overreach by Europe. In a blog post two years ago, it said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and no country should be able to impose rules on citizens of another.\n\nThe right to be forgotten was enshrined by the same European court in 2014 when it ruled that people could ask search engines like Google to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results appearing under searches for their names.\n\nGoogle, a unit of Alphabet Inc, has since received 845,501 requests to remove links, and removed 45 percent of the 3.3 million links it was asked to scrap.\n\nPRIVACY VS SPEECH\n\nUK rights group Article 19, which campaigns for freedom of speech and information, applauded Tuesday\u2019s judgment, which also said Google had some leeway in deciding whether to scrap links because of the balance between privacy rights and public interest.\n\n\u201cCourts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be de-listed - and also to recognize that this balance may vary around the world.\u201d\n\nBut Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of the data protection practice at law firm DLA Piper, said it would limit the impact of a successful right to be forgotten application as it will be ring-fenced to searches performed within the European Union.\n\n\u201cThis might obviously be frustrating for people who will see that people from outside Europe will still be able to find the de-listed search results when performing the same search on Google in New York, Shanghai or any other place in the world,\u201d he added.\n\nThe case arose in 2016 after France\u2019s privacy watchdog CNIL fined Google 100,000 euros ($109,790) for refusing to de-list sensitive information from search results globally upon request.\n\nGoogle took its fight to the French Council of State which subsequently sought advice from the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe Council separately asked for advice after CNIL decided not to order Google to remove links from internet search results based on the names of four individuals.\n\nThese included a satirical photomontage of a female politician, an article referring to someone as a public relations officer of the Church of Scientology, the placing under investigation of a male politician and the conviction of someone for sexual assaults against minors.\n\nCNIL said it would comply with Tuesday\u2019s ruling.", "description": "Google does not have to apply Europe's \"right to be forgotten\" law globally, the continent's top court ruled on Tuesday in a landmark case that pitted privacy rights against freedom of speech.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433336012&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0HB", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
