A project by the Russian Raptor Research and Conservation Network is tracking 13 of the endangered eagles to better understand what threats they face during their migration south to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nOutfitted with a mobile phone card, the tracker takes an eagle's location 12 times a day and texts the coordinates to the researchers' number in four messages. If the bird is outside mobile coverage area, as is often the case, it stores the data to text once it comes back in range.\n\nAfter spending most of this summer out of coverage in western Kazakhstan, Min flew to Iran so quickly earlier this month that his tracker still couldn't get a mobile connection.\n\nOnce he landed near a rubbish dump in Iran, it began sending hundreds of text messages of GPS data, costing the programme's shoestring budget up to 7,000 roubles (\u00a385) a day. Each text from Iran is priced at 49 roubles, about 25 times more than in Russia and three times more than in Kazakhstan.\n\nMin was born near the city of Minusinsk in Russia Credit: Yelena Shnaider/Telegram More\n\nMin's data quickly used up all the researchers' phone credit, which had already been depleted by three other eagles that flew to Iran, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, SibEco Centre ornithologist Yelena Shnaider told The Telegraph. The researchers even had to take out a loan.\n\n\u201cHe wasn't in touch all summer \u2026 We were happy to get a text from him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had expected to get it from Kazakhstan but suddenly he's in Iran, and we started to get his summer locations at three times the price.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Min's a good boy, about a week ago he left Iran and went to Saudi Arabia where it's cheaper,\u201d she added.\n\nSince she called on supporters to \u201cput money on the eagle's phone,\u201d more than 250,000 roubles (\u00a33,000) have been raised, enough to track all 13 birds through the end of the year.\n\nFeatured on the flags of Egypt and Kazakhstan, the steppe eagle can have a wingspan of more than seven feet and preys upon small mammals and birds in the plains and deserts of Eurasia.\n\nIt was once found as far west as Ukraine, but its numbers have plummeted in recent years. The species was updated to critically endangered on the IUCN red list in 2015, thanks in part to Russian tracking programmes.\n\nThe programme is tracking 13 steppe eagles to better understand threats to the critically endangered species Credit: Yelena Shnaider/Telegram More", "description": "A steppe eagle has nearly bankrupted a Russian bird-tracking programme with roaming text messages after he flew to Iran and began transmitting backlogged GPS data.", "authors": ["Alec Luhn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.3DhgUJKJN37YejTu3Vzrw--~B/aD03NTE7dz0xMjAyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/cb29265668960ff7c9a9ca4aac3fac95", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
