Chang\u2019e-4 is the first surface mission in history to explore the far side of the Moon.\n\nThe drive team decided to stall the trip for a while so that the rover could get a closer look at the \u201cgelatinous\u201d substance, as it was described by China\u2019s Lunar Exploration Program.\n\nA clearer image of the substance was shared on October 8 by Our Space, a government-sanctioned science publication on the social media site Weibo. It was spotted by Andrew Jones of Space.com, who has been reporting on the weird substance for months.\n\nDan Moriarty, a geologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, enhanced the images into different versions by adjusting brightness, contrast, and other customizable features.\n\nIn an email, Moriarty said that there are limitations to this technique because the images might be affected by JPEG compression and the lack of any scale bar.\n\nEven so, the enhanced pictures appear to corroborate previous suspicions that the material could be glass forged by meteorites crashing into the lunar surface, which would explain why it is the middle of a crater. It could also potentially be basaltic rock that originated from a time when the Moon was more volcanically active.\n\n\"The shape of the fragments appears fairly similar to other materials in the area,\u201d Moriarty told Space.com. \u201cWhat this tells us is that this material has a similar history as the surrounding material. It was broken up and fractured by impacts on the lunar surface, just like the surrounding soil.\u201d\n\nGlassy residue, both from meteorite impacts and ancient volcanism, is presumed to be relatively common on the Moon. For instance, a patch of \u201corange soil\u201d from a volcanic eruption that occurred more than three billion years ago was found by the last two astronauts to walk on the Moon: Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt of Apollo 17.\n\nBoth Yutu 2 and its mothership Chang\u2019e-4 are currently waking up after about two weeks of shutdown time to escape the cold temperatures of the lunar night. Hopefully, that means the rover will send back more pictures and data of its otherworldly surroundings soon.", "description": "China's Yutu 2 rover came across the shiny material in July, and the new photo may give us a better idea about what it could be.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1b116e71fd9008c56f375/lede/1571926931847-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-101847-AM.png?crop=1xw:0.7654xh;0xw,0.2346xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
