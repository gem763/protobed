Joyce Beatty in Ohio\u2019s 3rd District, is part of a new generation of young, progressive candidates who want to shake up the economic and political systems that have left too many Americans struggling to get by.\n\nHarper faces an uphill battle against Beatty, 69, who was elected in 2012 and has remained unchallenged in primaries since, in the heavily Democratic district that includes much of Columbus. The election will likely be decided in the March primary.\n\nHarper, a newcomer to politics, is pushing for what she calls a \u201cvery progressive\u201d agenda aimed at addressing issues of economic justice and creating a system that will \u201cwork for everyone.\u201d Her campaign doesn\u2019t take corporate PAC money, and she supports the Green New Deal, universal health care and swift action on reparations for racial injustice. Other young progressive candidates who are challenging incumbent Democrats in 2020 include 27-year-old Robert Emmons in Illinois, who is seeking to unseat longtime Rep. Bobby Rush.\n\n\u201cI consider myself part of a group of bold leaders ready for this next generation of work to make sure we have an economy that\u2019s really for everyone,\u201d Harper told HuffPost.\n\nMorgan Harper Ohio congressional candidate Morgan Harper at a rally\n\nHarper is endorsed by Justice Democrats, the same group that backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in her 2018 race, in which she famously beat a 10-term Democratic incumbent in Queens.\n\n\u201cIt feels like everything is on the line. People in our generation are feeling, \u2018Woah, what are we looking ahead toward?\u2019\u201d Harper added. \u201cI meet so many people working two, three jobs and it\u2019s still not adding up, who can\u2019t cover housing expenses, are not getting benefits.\u201d\n\nHarper said she thinks people of all ages agree the systems need to change, noting that, as someone of a younger generation, \u201cI am feeling that urgency of working with an understanding that I\u2019m going to be a part of the next 40 years and what is that going to look like.\u201d\n\nShout out to all the primary challengers who\u2019ve sworn off corporate PACs\u2014this is our moment. pic.twitter.com/utqXSIO63m \u2014 Morgan Harper (@mh4oh) October 9, 2019\n\nHarper grew up in Columbus, the second most economically segregated city in the country, according to a 2015 study from the University of Toronto. Given up for adoption as a baby, she lived in foster care for the first nine months of her life before being adopted. She was raised by a single mother of two, a public school teacher who was an immigrant from Trinidad.\n\nHer family went through a lot of \u201cearly financial stress and trauma,\u201d she said, and her childhood in Columbus exposed her to the \u201ceconomic inequality and segregation at play in Ohio and across the country, and made me want to do something about that.\u201d\n\nBut Harper \u201cgot lucky,\u201d as she put it, and received financial aid to attend private school. She later obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree at Tufts University, a master\u2019s degree from Princeton and a law degree from Stanford. After working at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for three years, she was most recently employed at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a nonprofit that provides financial support and other resources to local community groups.\n\nHarper thinks a \u201cbold\u201d progressive agenda is a winning platform in her district, which is about 58% white and 32% Black and has a median household income of about $38,000, per the 2010 census. She\u2019s pushing for policies such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d the Green New Deal, tuition-free public college, more affordable housing and reparations.\n\n\u201cWe have to be real about the injustices of the past that have been incurred by Black people,\u201d Harper said, pointing to 20th-century federal policies like redlining that denied homeownership opportunities to generations of Black families. Fast forward to recent years: In 2016, Black families in the U.S. had a median net worth of $17,600, compared with white families\u2019 median net worth of $171,000.\n\n\u201cThe racial wealth gap didn\u2019t just happen,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to be addressed through federal policy.\u201d\n\nWe can do this. We can rethink politics and have it be people-based and win. Morgan Harper, Candidate for Ohio's 3rd District\n\nHarper criticized the current House bill around reparations, co-sponsored by her opponent Beatty, who is vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. The bill would establish a commission to study and develop proposals for reparations for African Americans.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to study anymore. We need to talk about solutions and how we implement them,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThe history is there \u2014 just spend some few moments on Google. We\u2019re good to go. Let\u2019s start getting it done.\u201d\n\nBeatty told HuffPost that she had \u201cnot heard my opponent offer any solutions\u201d and that she believes the bill will \u201cidentify real-world, workable solutions to address hundreds of years of enslavement and systematic discrimination.\u201d\n\nOne of the main differences between Harper and Beatty\u2019s campaigns is that the former doesn\u2019t accept corporate PAC money. \u201cWhen you\u2019re taking this kind of money, you\u2019re not free to speak your mind,\u201d Harper said.\n\nBeatty, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, gets significant donations from corporate PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Her biggest donations so far this cycle have come from the insurance industry, commercial banks, securities and investments.\n\nBeatty acknowledged that she had taken PAC funds, adding that her voting record in Congress \u201ccertainly reflects putting my constituents first.\u201d She noted that she does not accept contributions from the gun or tobacco industries.\n\nHarper is still a long shot against Beatty, who has raised nearly $700,000 per the latest filing and has more than $1.4 million in cash on hand. Harper, who launched her campaign in July, raised about $320,000 in her first quarter through the end of September, according to her team. Her donations came from more than 2,000 donors who donated an average of $85. Harper said she was \u201cexcited\u201d about the haul, calling it a \u201ctestament to the strength of grassroots movements.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just means people believe in what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Harper said. \u201cWe can do this. We can rethink politics and have it be people-based and win.\u201d", "description": "The 36-year-old progressive is running for Congress to unseat Democratic incumbent Rep.
