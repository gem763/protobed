Park Ju-min said during the audit session, held at the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul.\u201cIs it legal or illegal for someone in the prosecution to leak information about suspects in a criminal investigation to the press before their formal indictment?\u201d Park asked.Pyo Chang-won, another DP lawmaker, added that the amount of information that prosecutors leak to the media in such fashion determines whether the investigation becomes a political issue.\u201cAt the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors\u2019 Office, if a news outlet specifically mentions a person as a suspect in their report or says how a probe is expected to unfold, the office bans access to reporters from that outlet,\u201d said DP Rep. Song Ki-hun.\u201cThe prosecution must devise an effective solution if it wishes to gain trust,\u201d Song warned.Bae Sung-bom, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office, which has been investigating Cho\u2019s family on a litany of allegations, dodged any criticism on the prosecution\u2019s part.\u201cAt the beginning of the probe when this first became an issue, we received written oaths from every prosecutor and investigator [involved in the Cho probe not to pre-disclose details about the suspects], and we educate deputy prosecutors every day [about it],\u201d said Bae.\u201cThere are many cases when reporters get quotes from someone related to the investigation or their lawyers. It\u2019s impossible for the prosecution to restrain each and every one of those instances,\u201d Bae continued.Rep. Chang Je-won of the LKP accused DP lawmakers of attacking the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office like \u201ca swarm of bees,\u201d saying it was legal for prosecutors to release information about criminal suspects to the press before their indictment if the details fall within the boundary of freedom of press.Chang encouraged prosecutors to \u201cinvestigate diligently.\u201dBY LEE SUNG-EUN, YONHAP [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
