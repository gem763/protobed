Now leading advocates of a People\u2019s Vote \u2014 or a second Brexit referendum \u2014 are admitting that they are unlikely to succeed this side of a general election.\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge show on Sunday that \u201cit simply does not look like\u201d the numbers are there for a second referendum.\n\nJust two weeks ago, his party was adamant that it was a referendum, not an early election, that could solve Brexit. \u201cBoris Johnson is determined to have a general election,\u201d Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said then, \u201cbut the best way to resolve the Brexit chaos is to have a people\u2019s vote.\u201d\n\nNow Swinson has joined forces with the Scottish National Party to push for a December 9 poll instead. \u201cIf the Labour party had wholeheartedly come on board with the People\u2019s Vote campaign, we might have been able to deliver that at an earlier stage,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program.\n\nIt is a public acknowledgement of a reality that has been clear for months. Each time it has been put to a vote in parliament, a second referendum proposal has been defeated. The closest it came to passing was in April, when it was rejected by 12 votes \u2014 and then only in a non-binding, indicative vote with numerous abstentions.\n\nThe likelihood of a second referendum now looks dimmer still after divisions inside the People\u2019s Vote campaign group reached boiling point last night.\n\nThe likelihood of a second referendum now looks dimmer still after divisions inside the People\u2019s Vote campaign group reached boiling point last night. Two of its leading figures \u2014 director James McGrory, and head of comms Tom Baldwin \u2014 were unexpectedly fired in an email from Roland Rudd, the chairman of Open Britain, one of the organizations that makes up the campaign.\n\nSenior campaign figures were locked in a broadcasting war this morning, with Baldwin telling the Today program that he won\u2019t accept his dismissal by Rudd. \u201cI don\u2019t work for Roland Rudd,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to be the best week for putting a wrecking ball through the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe mood in People\u2019s Vote HQ was sour this morning, and one official said Rudd had canceled a morning meeting where he was due to face questions. \u201cThe People\u2019s Vote campaign belongs to the people who work on it and the campaigners and activists who give their time to it and the people who show up to campaign for it. It does not belong to Roland Rudd,\u201d they said.\n\nOne staffer \u2014 an ally of Rudd \u2014 said the boss pulled out of the meeting this morning after workers tried to \u201cambush\u201d him and film him. A third of the workforce stormed out of the office and ended up with a day off. The staff member said the dispute was triggered three months ago when People\u2019s Vote bigwigs Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson tried to oust Rudd from his position.\n\n\u201cJames and Tom are not going to come back. Clearly they have been dismissed they are former staff,\u201d they added. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction that we could have done without. But there is never a good time for these things \u2014 especially in Brexit. Every day is a crisis.\u201d\n\nLabour, too, has twisted the knife, with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tweeting that the Lib Dems and SNP had \u201cgiven up\u201d on a referendum. Peter Kyle, one of the architects of the proposal to put any Brexit deal to a confirmatory vote, tweeted: \u201cA million people have twice marched in support of a final say referendum. No one has marched for a general election.\u201d\n\nBut with both the Lib Dems and the SNP now backing an election before a People\u2019s Vote \u2014 and willing to force a vote on the issue in parliament tomorrow \u2014 the growing likelihood is that it will be up to a new parliament to decide.\n\nThis insight is from POLITICO's Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU available to Brexit Pro subscribers.
