An Unimaginable Tragedy.", "language": "en", "text": "At 3:10 p.m. on October 2, 1998, 13-year-old Gregory Witman returned home from school. Seven minutes later, his 15-year-old brother, Zachary, who was home sick that day, dialed 911.\n\n\u201cIs he breathing?\u201d the operator asked.\n\n\u201cNo. I gotta call my mom!\u201d Zachary said.\n\nPolice arrived on the scene to find Gregory dead in a pool of his own blood on the laundry-room floor. He had been stabbed more than 100 times with a penknife, and nearly decapitated. Later, Zachary would testify in a Pennsylvania court that he had roused from his sickbed after hearing a commotion downstairs. After checking the house, he had found his brother brutally murdered in the laundry room.\n\nOver the next five years, the case underwent a series of botched pretrial motions and appeals. In 2003, despite a dearth of evidence, Zachary was found guilty of first-degree murder and later sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. (He was represented by Cristina Gutierrez, the attorney featured in the podcast Serial; before her death, she was disbarred due to negligence.) Zachary and his parents, Ron and Sue Witman, have maintained his innocence.\n\nRick Lee, a journalist at the York Daily Record, reported on the case. Fifteen years after Zachary\u2019s conviction, Lee\u2019s son, Joe, wanted to check up on Ron and Sue. Though generally wary of the media\u2014the Witmans felt that most reporters, with the exception of the York Daily Record, had jumped to conclusions about their son\u2019s culpability\u2014they agreed to let the younger Lee make a short documentary.\n\n\u201cThey wrongfully accused him and ultimately wrongfully convicted him,\u201d says Ron Witman in Lee\u2019s film, The Witmans. \u201cIn the process, they killed the parents as well\u2014myself and my wife.\u201d\n\nRather than foreground the intrigue of the crime itself, Lee focuses his devastating film on how Ron and Sue have coped with the unimaginable tragedy that befell them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a true-crime show or an investigation podcast,\u201d Lee told me. \u201cWe just wanted to show these two people, what they\u2019ve been through, and what they continue to go through. I think especially for young filmmakers, it would have been enticing to get caught up in the drama of the crime\u2014which there is quite a lot\u2014but I just kept pushing that urge away.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Ron speaks candidly about how the couple\u2019s relationship has deteriorated. \u201cWe love each other, but we cope differently,\u201d he says. \u201cIt leads to a lot of arguments, which makes us in a lot of ways roommates more than husband and wife \u2026 we have been placed [in] an impossible situation, and it has torn us apart.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the film, Ron admits that the only thing that keeps him going is the hope of Zachary\u2019s eventual release. Just months ago, his wishes were granted: Zachary\u2019s conviction was thrown out after a retroactive ruling that mandatory life sentences are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders. In May 2019, Zachary agreed to a plea bargain and was released from prison.\n\n\u201cAfter 16 years, they have their son back, and they couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d Lee said.", "description": "One of Ron and Sue Witman\u2019s sons was convicted of murdering the other, placing the parents in an impossible situation.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/06/witman_2-12/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-28"}
