REUTERS/Jose Manuel Ribeiro/File Photo\n\nLISBON (Reuters) - European banks must be flexible and quick to act to avoid losing clients as they face imminent rivalry from global technology firms and digital banking apps, European Central Bank board member Carlos Costa said on Tuesday.\n\nCosta, who is also the head of the Bank of Portugal, told a conference in Lisbon that financial supervisors such as central banks also need to adopt new tools to deal with \u201cthe new reality\u201d of fast-changing financial technology and companies like Facebook (FB.O) or Google moving into finance.\n\n\u201cAlthough the \u2018Big Tech\u2019 is currently limited to Asia-Pacific and North America, we must not forget that they have a global vocation and that their expansion into the European market is a matter of time,\u201d Costa said.\n\n\u201cThe banking business model as we know it will inevitably undergo profound changes,\u201d he added, pointing to comparative advantages of tech firms over banks in using big data and artificial intelligence for credit analysis and risk assessment.\n\nLast December, Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google and digital banking app Revolut obtained banking licences in Lithuania, which is part of the European Union and the euro zone.\n\n\u201cThere will be an adjustment on the banks\u2019 side. Banks will have to be flexible and quick in anticipating client needs and the evolution of the market so as not to lose the direct relationship they have built with their customers,\u201d Costa said.", "description": "European banks must be flexible and quick to act to avoid losing clients as they face imminent rivalry from global technology firms and digital banking apps, European Central Bank board member Carlos Costa said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443762438&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L18M", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
