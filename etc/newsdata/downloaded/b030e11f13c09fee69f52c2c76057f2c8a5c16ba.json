It was nice for everyone.\n\n\"He did not accept our proposal to meet because he has already chosen another club.\"", "description": "Some Madrid board members are said to regret re-appointing Zidane and no longer trust him to bring success", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Skysports"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RCD-Mallorca-v-Real-Madrid-CF-La-Liga.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
