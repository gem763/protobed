REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nLam, who is under pressure from Beijing to defuse the public anger stirring the protests, said the dialogue sessions would be as open as possible, with members of the public able to sign up to attend.\n\n\u201cHong Kong society has really accumulated a lot of deep rooted economic, social and even political issues, I hope these different forms of dialogue can provide a platform for us to discuss,\u201d Lam told reporters at a weekly briefing.\n\nShe said the issues included housing and land shortages in one of the world\u2019s most densely populated cities of 7.4 million. Young people are particularly frustrated by the high cost of finding a place of their own to live.\n\n\u201cBut I have to stress here, dialogue platform doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have to take resolute enforcement actions. Suppressing the violence in front of us is still the priority,\u201d she said.\n\nThe former British colony has been roiled by nearly four months of sometimes violent protests.\n\nThe trigger for the unrest was an extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.\n\nBut the demonstrators\u2019 demands have broadened to include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into their complaints of excessive force by the police.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland - including a much-cherished independent legal system.\n\nBut many residents complain about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs despite the promise of autonomy.\n\nLam, who has been a focus of protesters\u2019 anger, capitulated to one of their main demands on Sept. 4, announcing the full withdrawal of the extradition bill.\n\nBut some said that was too little, too late, and the protests have continued.\n\n\u2018EROSION\u2019\n\nPolice on Monday said 89 people were arrested over the weekend after \u201cradical protesters\u201d attacked two police officers on Sunday evening, hurling petrol bombs and bricks.\n\nBrawls also broke out between anti-government protesters and others who support Beijing.\n\nNearly 1,500 people have been arrested since the protests intensified in June.\n\nThe turmoil is beginning to hit the economy of the financial hub.\n\nCredit rating agency Moody\u2019s changed its outlook on Hong Kong\u2019s rating to negative from stable on Monday, reflecting what it called the rising risk of \u201can erosion in the strength of Hong Kong\u2019s institutions\u201d.\n\nThe institutional features that grant Hong Kong greater political and economic autonomy \u2014 together with the city\u2019s intrinsic credit strengths \u2014 accounted for its higher rating than China, the agency said.\n\nLam said the Moody\u2019s decision disappointing.\n\n\u201cWe do not concur, especially if the justification for that sort of change in outlook is premised on whether we\u2019re still upholding \u2018one country two systems\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nChina also says it is committed to \u201cone country two systems\u201d and it denies meddling in Hong Kong while stressing it is an internal Chinese issue.\n\nChina has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.", "description": "Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday she and her team would begin dialogue sessions with the community next week, while reiterating that violence that has roiled the city over three months of protests must end.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430670997&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G040-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
