They argued the government offered only vague reasons for their inclusion. The government said one man was listed due to \u201cconcerns\u201d regarding a trip to Yemen in 2010, and another reportedly told the FBI he had \"distributed speeches\" from a now-dead terrorist, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cThe government has taken reasonable measures to ensure basic fairness to the plaintiffs, and followed procedures reasonably designed to protect against erroneous deprivation of the plaintiffs\u2019 liberty,\u201d Judge Raymond Fisher wrote in the court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the four plaintiffs, blasted the decision, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cOur clients have been unable to visit family, pursue job opportunities or fulfill religious obligations for over nine years based on vague criteria, secret evidence and unreliable government predictions,\u201d ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said.\n\nFisher ruled the government gave each plaintiff \u201cfair notice\u201d that the allegations of their conduct would \u201craise suspicion\u201d and that after examining the government\u2019s full explanations, \u201can unclassified summary of the undisclosed reasons was not possible.\u201d", "description": "A U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gavel_istock_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
