Retail electricity prices have increased 56 per cent in real terms over the past decade. Governments need to be seen to address this.\n\nThe first intervention proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was to cap the standing offer prices set by retailers.\n\nRetail electricity markets are lethargic and opaque, but they aren\u2019t the cause of high prices. The changes will just compress the spread of deals offered, lower standing offers and shallower discounts.\n\nThe second and more aggressive intervention is the imminent \u201cBig Stick\u201d legislation, which seeks to force retailers to pass on cost savings to customers and for generators to play nicely by contracting reasonably and not manipulating prices.\n\nThere is a high level of subjectivity in whether and how these new regulations will be enforced. Some of the interventions include the Treasurer being able to contract directly in the market, forcing businesses to contract on specific terms as required by the ACCC and, as the ultimate threat, forced divestment of assets.\n\nIts very design reflects a worryingly low level of confidence in competitive markets. This disquiet has spread to other sectors of the economy. Governments are supposed to frame and regulate markets, not interfere in them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACCC chairman Rod Sims appears convinced that the big three electricity businesses, AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia, are using their market power to inflate prices and are a key driver of rising electricity prices.\n\nThe big three are vertically integrated, meaning they sit on both sides of the electricity market, generating power and buying it for their large retail customer books.\n\nBalancing generation and retail is to manage risk, not create market power. It means these businesses have a strong disincentive to inflate wholesale electricity prices, because their positions are never balanced perfectly meaning they are regularly exposed in the spot market. Spikes in the market can and do cost them millions.\n\nThe cause of big increases in wholesale prices since 2016 are no secret. Around 5 gigawatts of coal generation has exited the market, in particular two big power stations in South Australia and Victoria.\n\nShortages in firm supply have pushed prices up, exacerbated by scarcity of coal in NSW and high gas prices. Price spikes are the market doing its job, signalling new investment in capacity with the offer of good returns.\n\nThe huge influx of wind and solar only has a weak effect suppressing prices because of its intermittency. To really bring down prices renewables need more firming capacity: batteries, pumped hydro and gas peakers.\n\nAnd so to deliver this Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor has introduced the Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) program designed to push these types of capacity into the market.\n\nMore than 66 applications were reduced to a short list of 12 projects, revealing healthy competition for new investment in the electricity market. It\u2019s still unclear how many projects will be approved, or what the criteria is for success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUNGI followed the Federal Government\u2019s 18-month-long pre-election announcement to underwrite the $5 billion Snowy 2.0, a giant pumped hydro project which could take up to a decade to complete.\n\nThis scale of government underwriting is binary: it makes it impossible to invest unless your project is also underwritten.\n\nIn practice this means the commercial merits of a project are overridden by a new 'imperial court' model, where companies supplicate themselves before ministers to advance their projects.\n\nPolitical fundraising dinners will become investment opportunities. New investments risk being decided as much by political opportunity as on technical merit.\n\nRegardless of these interventions, electricity prices are expected to ease gradually over the next two to three years anyway. The government will take the credit and justify its interventions.\n\nThe impacts are likely to endure: a stifled, political and more regulated electricity system, a market that operates simply as a dispatch mechanism and ultimately less efficiency and higher costs for all consumers.", "description": "Government intervention in the national electricity markets is the problem.
