The blaze was so intense that the store\u2019s steel shutter melted. Radical protesters have been targeting enterprises, including retail stores and banks, with links to the Chinese mainland. [PHOTO/CHINA DAILY]\n\nChinese mainland-linked stores, banks and bookshops in Hong Kong were again singled out for attack on Sunday as rioters tore through central Kowloon.\n\nIn the 20th straight weekend of social unrest in the city, household names, including snacks giant Best Mart 360, Xiaomi Hong Kong, Bank of China, Chung Hwa Book Company and Chinese medicine company Beijing Tong Ren Tang, were bashed in the rampage.\n\nThe flagship store of Xiaomi \u2014 a mainland electronics company \u2014 in Mong Kok was seriously damaged as rioters ripped off posters and pulled down boards in front of the store and pried the shutters open. In the evening, rioters set fire to the front portion of the store, with thick black smoke engulfing the premises before firefighters arrived.\n\nIt was the second time the shop had come under attack this month.\n\nMobs also pried open the shutter at Bank of China\u2019s Jordan branch and smashed counters. Bank of China\u2019s ATMs on the streets were burned. At a Chung Hwa Book Company bookstore, its doors were smashed, bookshelves were overturned and books scattered on the floor.\n\nA branch of Bank of East Asia in Mong Kok was mistakenly vandalized. Its glass windows and doors were smashed, but rioters painted graffiti with the word \u201csorry\u201d on its walls. Bank of East Asia is a Hong Kong-based banking and financial services company.\n\nBesides mainland-linked enterprises, some political parties were also targeted. The office of a district councilor of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong \u2014 the city\u2019s largest political party \u2014 was seriously damaged as rioters stormed it, overturned file cabinets and left documents scattered on the ground.\n\nLau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies \u2014 the nation\u2019s leading Hong Kong affairs think tank \u2014 said the specific targets singled out by the rioters showed that they\u2019re discontented with the central government instead of just opposing the now-withdrawn extradition bill.\n\nHe said as protesters are unable to attack the Liaison Office of the Central People\u2019s Government in the HKSAR again as they did on July 21, they have to pick mainland-linked businesses as targets, adding it\u2019s also a challenge to the central government\u2019s jurisdiction over the special administrative region.\n\nLau said such vandalism will widen the rift between the pro-establishment and opposition camps, and have a deterrent impact on voters in next month\u2019s district council elections. Under such circumstances, he said it would be difficult to ensure fair elections.\n\nHe said the HKSAR government is now under greater pressure to upgrade its physical force and use tougher legal means to curb the violence and illegal acts.\n\nThe Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions voiced \u201csevere condemnation\u201d of the rioters\u2019 illegal acts, calling them \u201cheinous\u201d. It said such violence and vandalism not only affect residents\u2019 normal life, but also greatly threaten public safety.\n\nThe federation urged residents to draw a clear line with rioters and denounce the violence.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/21/5dad22d6a310cf3e97a2321a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
