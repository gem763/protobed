Many of them are now around 12, 13 or 14.'\n\n\n\nLast month she walked free from HMP Send, Surrey, after a parole board ruled she had 'shown remorse', and was put in the probation hostel costing up to \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nAnd the hostel was just 547 yards from a nursery and less than half a mile from a children's club, according to The Sunday People.\n\nIn 2009, George admitted 13 sexual assault charges, but maintained a silence over the names of children she assaulted.\n\nChild protection officers have visited 180 children thought to have had contact with George, and 21 families have taken up an offer of support.\n\nGeorge's co defendant Angela Allen, who raped a girl of three, has already served the five-year minimum of her sentence imposed at the same time.\n\nThe ringleader of the paedophile gang, Colin Blanchard, will be eligible for parole next year after being jailed in 2011 for a minimum of nine years.", "description": "Britain's most notorious female paedophile Vanessa George, 49, has been spotted enjoying the sun at a bail hostel in Birmingham.
