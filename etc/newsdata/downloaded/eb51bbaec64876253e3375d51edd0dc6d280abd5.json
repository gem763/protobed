This was a weekly lowering of -26,787 net contracts from the previous week which had a total of -66,642 net contracts.\n\nThe week\u2019s net position was the result of the gross bullish position (longs) falling by -16,361 contracts (to a weekly total of 96,684 contracts) while the gross bearish position (shorts) saw a gain by 10,426 contracts for the week (to a total of 190,113 contracts).\n\nVIX speculative bearish positions pushed higher once again this week following a modest gain last week (-9,489 contracts). This week\u2019s increase by more than -26,000 contracts is the largest one-week bearish rise in the past twenty-five weeks and puts the overall bearish level back near the -100,000 contract standing. VIX speculator bets hit a record high bearish position earlier this year in late April (-180,359 contracts) before pulling back. Bearish bets also looked to be heading that way again in late July (-144,314 contracts) before the risk-off themes of August prompted traders to sharply flee their bearish positions. The recent calming in the markets may see traders build their bearish positions back above the -100,000 contract level in coming weeks.\n\nVIX Commercial Positions:\n\nThe commercial traders position, hedgers or traders engaged in buying and selling for business purposes, totaled a net position of 102,041 contracts on the week. This was a weekly gain of 30,167 contracts from the total net of 71,874 contracts reported the previous week.\n\nVIX COT Futures Large Trader Positions\n\nVIX Futures:\n\nOver the same weekly reporting time-frame, from Tuesday to Tuesday, the VIX Futures (Front Month) closed at approximately $17.67 which was a fall of $-1.85 from the previous close of $19.52, according to unofficial market data.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Zachary Storella covering: CBOE Volatility Index.
