It will be transformed into a \"safe zone,\" or buffer, between Turkey and Kurdish forces.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Kurdish groups have yet to confirm whether they agree to the deal.\n\nTurkey and Russia both hailed the agreement as \"historic.\" Critics like Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the US has now \"been sidelined\" as a decision-maker in the conflict.\n\n\"Russia and the murderous Assad regime are calling the shots,\" Menendez said at a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from the agreement.\n\nWinner: Putin and Russia\n\nReuters\n\nPutin has emerged in the agreement as one of the main power brokers in the fate of Syria's future, taking over the role the US once held.\n\nThe agreement between Putin and Erdogan may seem surprising, given that Russia backed the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and Turkey supported rebel groups fighting against the regime.\n\nBut the agreement between the two world powers strengthens their influence in Syria as the country tries to rebound after years of civil war.\n\nAccording to CNN, Putin said Ankara and Moscow have agreed to respect Syria's \"sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" which can be framed as a successful foreign policy move by Russia.\n\nAnalysts told The Washington Post that the deal also helps Russia's ally, Assad, in regaining control over more of the fragmented country.\n\nAssad also \"expressed his full support\" for the deal, the Kremlin said, according to the BBC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinner: Erdogan and Turkey", "description": "Here are the winners and losers from the agreement reached Tuesday, and what it means for the region's future as it tries to rebuild.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MIO99JpcQTI18aGid2OGXQ--~B/aD01MTI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/454f80a85e8fcfc6fd4619a82dec34e6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
