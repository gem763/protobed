Here\u2019s the lowdown on what happened.\n\nPaddy Picks in power move\n\nThe episode started off with pizza and a party, while the contestants danced alone to Britney Spears.\n\nCut to the music ending and Tim adorably asking: \u2018Was that Beyonce or something?\u2019\n\nTim and Paddy dance to Britney Spears (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThe party then heated up with a friendly game to get to know newbie Paddy.\n\nIt worked like this: Each contestant had to enter a photo of their own (that no one else in the game had seen before) into different categories like \u2018Sexy\u2019, \u2018Funny\u2019 and \u2018No Filter\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter each player submitted their photo to The Circle group chat, Paddy had the power to grant one of them as the winner of that category.\n\nThe lovable Irish lad chose Ella riding two dolphins as the winner in the \u2018Funny\u2019 category, while Jack won the \u2018Sexy\u2019 category with a photo of himself shirtless in a towel.\n\nBut it was the \u2018No Filter\u2019 category that pulled at everyone\u2019s heart strings and really moved Paddy.\n\n(Picture: Channel 4)\n\nGeorgina, who has Crohn\u2019s disease \u2013 uploaded a photo of herself with a breathing tube. As soon as Paddy saw it, he remarked to himself: \u2018It takes courage to put a picture like that up.\u2019\n\nThere was no doubt in Paddy\u2019s mind that Georgina was the winner.\n\nTheir prize? The winning contestants got to keep their winning photos in their profile.\n\nDating disaster stories\n\nIn true Ella style, she wanted to cut through the boring small talk between the contestants and spice things up by asking Beth and Brooke if they had any dating horror stories.\n\nBrooke goes first and regales the group chat with a story about a guy who lied about his age, job and living situation\n\nShe then jokes: \u2018You could say I was slightly catfished but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time #JaysMum\u2019\n\nBeth goes next and underwhelms the group with another catfish story.\n\nElla (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThen Ella takes the cake with the ultimate dating horror story.\n\n\u2018I once used a guy\u2019s thumb print whilst he slept to get into his phone and book a taxi because my phone had died,\u2019 Ella revealed. \u2018I then didn\u2019t speak to him again #HumpAndDump\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmg Ella.\n\nPaddy and Georgina make the nation cry\n\nNext came the sweetest conversation between Paddy and Georgina about living with their disabilities.\n\nPaddy took the opportunity to tell Georgina he thought her posting the photo in the hospital bed was \u2018brave\u2019.\n\nHe then decided to open up to her about his own disability \u2013 a fact he had deliberately held back from telling the other contestants.\n\nPaddy tells Georgina: \u2018I think we could have a lot in common in terms of obstacles we\u2019ve had to overcome. That picture you posted last night of you in the hospital was brave.\u2019\n\nHe continues: \u2018I know how hard it is to talk about your condition when people ask. I know this because I have cerebral palsy in my legs. I haven\u2019t told people yet but felt I could trust you with this.\u2019\n\nPaddy and Georgina get emotional (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nGeorgina is taken aback by the revelation and they both start crying.\n\nShe messages back: \u2018May I ask why you feel you want to hide it from the group? It can remain our secret, but I don\u2019t want you to feel like it\u2019s something that you have to keep quiet.\u2019\n\nPaddy responds: \u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m ashamed or scared. It\u2019s that I wanted to feel what it would be like for once to just be me and not be \u201cthat disabled guy\u201d\u2018.\n\nBeth and Jack team up to become Joyce\n\nAt the end of the episode, it\u2019s revealed Beth and Jack scored the lowest ratings in the latest ranking of the contestants so in a twist, they\u2019re both immediately blocked from The Circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair pack their bags and head to the Inner Circle to meet each other for the first time.\n\nJack discovers that Beth has been using someone else\u2019s photos but remarks he fancies her.\n\nThe Circle then reveal the public voted to keep both Beth and Jack in the game.\n\n(Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThe pair then make their way to their new shared apartment and get to know their surroundings (no, they\u2019re not sharing a bed).\n\nThen it\u2019s time to find out who they\u2019re going to be going back into the game as, as they nervously wait to see who pops up.\n\nCut to 62-year-old Joyce popping up on screen, holding her adorable puppy.\n\nThe two react in horror as they start to piece together exactly how they\u2019re going to pull it all off.\n\nGood luck, guys.\n\nThe Circle continues Monday at 10pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
