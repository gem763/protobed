Now, he is set to appear in the highly anticipated Star Wars series The Mandalorian.\n\nAsked if he was a big Star Wars fan growing up, the 51-year-old comedian quickly replies, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just too old by the time I saw Star Wars,\u201d Burr says, even though he was just 9 years old when A New Hope was released. \u201cIt was geared towards kids and I was watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High by the time it came out.\u201d\n\nBurr elaborated during a 2015 interview with Conan O\u2019Brien the night before The Force Awakens opened in theaters. \u201cSomehow I missed that movie when it came out,\u201d he said of the original. By the time he finally saw that film in his twenties, he viewed it as a \u201ccheesy self-help book put in outer space with, like, Muppets.\u201d\n\nMocking fans who were at that moment waiting in lines to see the highly anticipated sequel, Burr asked, \u201cWhy does it matter? Why is it this important?\u201d\n\nBurr got introduced to The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau through their mutual friend Mike Binder, who directed Burr\u2019s most recent Netflix special Paper Tiger. Favreau\u2019s Swingers co-star Vince Vaughn is also an executive producer of Burr\u2019s animated Netflix series F Is for Family.\n\nFavreau is apparently a listener of Burr\u2019s long-running Monday Morning Podcast, where the comic rants a lot about sports and occasionally makes fun of nerd culture, including Marvel superheroes, Game of Thrones and the Star Wars universe. \u201cAnytime a Star Wars [movie] came out I always made fun of them,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018How old are you? Why are you still dressing like Boba Fett?\u2019 and all this shit.\u201d\n\nA while back, Favreau came up to him at a birthday party they were both attending and told him there was a part in the new Star Wars TV series that he thought Burr might be good for. Burr replied, \u201cJon, you know I make fun of Star Wars all the time,\u201d suggesting that he give the role to someone who cares about that cinematic universe.\n\n\u201cNo, I think that would be funny,\u201d he says Favreau told him.\n\nBurr\u2019s wife Nia Hill was the one who ultimately convinced him to accept the offer. \u201cShe gives the best career advice,\u201d he says. \u201cNot that I was going to say no to Jon Favreau. I don\u2019t give a shit what he was doing, I was going to say yes.\u201d\n\nThe experience may have even turned Burr into a Star Wars convert.\n\nHe says the shoot \u201cended up being this amazing experience,\u201d adding, \u201cIt was really, really fun in the way that they shot it.\u201d Burr heaps praise on director Rick Famuyiwa, who previously made the film Dope and helmed two episodes of the The Mandalorian\u2019s first season, which premieres November 12th on Disney+. Before he says more, Burr catches himself and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in trouble, but the way he shot it I was just like, \u2018Oh wow, this isn\u2019t your dad\u2019s Star Wars.\u2019\u201d\n\nBurr is not quite clear on what he\u2019s allowed to reveal, if anything. \u201cThese Star Wars things, it\u2019s like talking about the Federal Reserve or something,\u201d he says. \u201cThe technology was just next level,\u201d he adds, explaining that he got dizzy during one scene because the background was moving behind the other actor. \u201cIs this what vertigo feels like?\u201d he remembers thinking.\n\nBefore Disney put out the official trailer for the show at its D3 expo this summer, Favreau showed it to him personally. It was Burr\u2019s last day of shooting on the show and the creator pulled him aside to check it out. When he saw the opening shot of Stormtrooper heads on stakes, he thought, \u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\u2019m in this?!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at it, it looks like a Spaghetti Western,\u201d he says of the limited footage that has been released. \u201cIt just looks so fucking badass.\u201d\n\nBurr thinks that most of his fans, who may be similarly anti-Star Wars, aren\u2019t quite aware yet that he\u2019s in the new show, but is sure they will find it \u201cfunny\u201d once they figure it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool is that I have a lot of sports fans that listen to my podcast, so what I\u2019m hoping is that this will drive them into the kind of sci-fi that I like,\u201d he says, citing more \u201cgritty\u201d films like Blade Runner as an example.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for it to come out,\u201d he says of The Mandalorian, claiming that he would watch it even if he \u201cwasn\u2019t in it.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Comedy Bang!
