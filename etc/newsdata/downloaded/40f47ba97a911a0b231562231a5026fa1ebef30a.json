But sometimes a complaint is just necessary. Like when, I don't know, you've spent a chunk of this week in an airport going nowhere fast.\n\nIt could be something needs fixing, perhaps it has to be resolved so future customers don\u2019t have the same experience, perhaps you deserve a refund. Perhaps because things went so wrong that you just have to say something or you feel like you might explode.\n\nThese days we have so many ways to complain after a bad experience \u2013 email, Twitter, Facebook. It can be very easy to fire off a furious diatribe on social media and in a few cases that can have a big impact.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut when things do go wrong it\u2019s essentially to keep a cool head and complain the in right way to make sure you get the best outcome. Here\u2019s how.\n\nKeep calm\n\nThis may sound patronising but it\u2019s a really important one to remember when you\u2019re wound up by bad service, a faulty product or rude staff.\n\nIf you get angry then your complaint will be taken less seriously. Worse, if you are flustered and furious then it\u2019s harder to keep track of what is being said.\n\nSo whether you are complaining in person immediately after something has gone wrong, or complaining to the relevant watchdog or ombudsman after nothing else has worked \u2013 remind yourself to stay calm and you will do better.\n\nGive the company a chance to fix it first\n\nBefore you escalate your complaint you really do need to give the company a chance to resolve your issue first.\n\nThat means it\u2019s important to have some idea what you want to happen. Do you want them to replace an item for example? Refund it? Compensate you for what you have been through? Or do you just want them to acknowledge the fault and try to put it right?\n\nUnless you know what outcome you want, you risk not feeling satisfied with any result. So decide what you want, make sure you are confident that it\u2019s a fair request and tell the company what you want to happen.\n\nJust a heads-up that if you are trying to claim compensation, that can be harder to prove a case for, so make sure you keep receipts and explanations for any additional costs you have incurred as a result. It\u2019s really important to be realistic about what the company should do to put your issue right.\n\nRemember to keep track of all communications, from emails to phone calls, so you have a clear trail of the complaint\u2019s process. That will help if you need to escalate it later.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to include all details if you write or email; forgetting to include your customer or booking reference, or details like your address, may mean delays in dealing with your complaint.\n\nGet some tips online\n\nThanks to the internet, you can often find other people who have had the same issue and see what kind of resolution they achieved.\n\nIf your complaint is about a major consumer issue then there may even be forums and social media groups dedicated to supporting people in their complaints.\n\nThe recent spate of complaints over new build homes is a good example \u2013 there are a number of Facebook groups where buyers share advice and experiences.\n\nYou may also find helpful template letters that can help you approach the company with your complaint and make you aware of your customer rights.\n\nCitizens Advice has a fantastic library of template letters, ranging from faulty goods to complaints about a holiday.\n\nEnlist the right help\n\nA whole industry has sprung up around complaints, particularly complaints over PPI. Often these companies are not necessary to help you achieve a successful resolution but will take a portion of any compensation that you receive.\n\nFor that reason, it\u2019s sensible to be very cautious about using an intermediary company to process your complaint.\n\nHowever, there are some free-to-use organisations that may be able to help you process your complaint. Citizens Advice may be able to offer support or the online Resolver service provides free, independent help.\n\nFor some complaints you may be able to escalate to the relevant ombudsman, if the company has been given a chance to resolve it but you are still not happy.\n\nThere are a number of ombudsmen, dealing with energy, consumer rights, housing and finances. They are independent organisations that exist to help resolve complaints without going to court and they are free and impartial.\n\nYou can find the right ombudsman for your problem via the Ombudsman Association or just by searching the web.\n\nBlow this thing wide open\n\nSometimes your complaint just isn\u2019t taken seriously but there\u2019s no organisation to escalate it to. When that happens, it may be time to take to Twitter or leave a poor review.\n\nPerhaps that will jog the company into behaving better, perhaps it will warn other potential customers. At the very least, it might help you feel better.", "description": "Unless you\u2019re a really unpleasant person you probably don\u2019t enjoy complaining.
