Why?", "language": "en", "text": "The obvious question for anybody who spends at least two seconds looking at the graph above is: What the hell happened around 1990?\n\nAccording to Christian Smith, a sociology and religion professor at the University of Notre Dame, America\u2019s nonreligious lurch has mostly been the result three historical events: the association of the Republican Party with the Christian right, the end of the Cold War, and 9/11.\n\nThis story begins with the rise of the religious right in the 1970s. Alarmed by the spread of secular culture\u2014including but not limited to the sexual revolution, the Roe v. Wade decision, the nationalization of no-fault divorce laws, and Bob Jones University losing its tax-exempt status over its ban on interracial dating\u2014Christians became more politically active. The GOP welcomed them with open arms. The party, which was becoming more dependent on its exurban-white base, needed a grassroots strategy and a policy platform. Within the next decade, the religious right\u2014including Ralph Reed\u2019s Christian Coalition, James Dobson\u2019s Focus on the Family, and Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority\u2014had become the Republicans\u2019 organizing and fundraising powerhouse. In 1980, the GOP social platform was a facsimile of conservative Christian views on sexuality, abortion, and school prayer.\n\nRead: Evangelical fear elected Trump\n\nBut the marriage between the religious and political right disgusted liberal Democrats with weak connections to the Church. It also shocked the conscience of moderates, who preferred a wide berth between their faith and their politics. Smith said it\u2019s possible that young liberals and loosely affiliated Christians first registered their aversion to the Christian right in the early 1990s, after a decade of observing its powerful role in conservative politics.\n\nSecond, it may have felt unpatriotic to confess one\u2019s ambivalence toward God while the U.S. was locked in a geopolitical showdown with a godless Evil Empire. In 1991, however, the Cold War ended. As the U.S.S.R. dissolved, so did atheism\u2019s association with America\u2019s nemesis. After that, \u201cnones\u201d could be forthright about their religious indifference, without worrying that it made them sound like Soviet apologists.\n\nThird, America\u2019s next geopolitical foe wasn\u2019t a godless state. It was a God-fearing, stateless movement: radical Islamic terrorism. A series of bombings and attempted bombings in the 1990s by fundamentalist organizations such as al-Qaeda culminated in the 9/11 attacks. It would be a terrible oversimplification to suggest that the fall of the Twin Towers encouraged millions to leave their church, Smith said. But over time, al-Qaeda became a useful referent for atheists who wanted to argue that religion was inherently destructive.\n\nMeanwhile, during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Christianity\u2019s association with unpopular Republican policies drove more young liberals and moderates away from both the party and the Church. New Atheists, such as Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris, became intellectual celebrities; the 2006 best seller American Theocracy argued that evangelicals in the Republican coalition were staging a quiet coup that would plunge the country into disarray and financial ruin. Throughout the Bush presidency, liberal voters\u2014especially white liberal voters\u2014 detached from organized religion in ever-higher numbers.\n\nReligion has lost its halo effect in the past three decades, not because science drove God from the public square, but rather because politics did.
