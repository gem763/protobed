The tweets, which have since been deleted, were reportedly posted in 2012, when King was 16.\n\nBALTIMORE RESTAURANT'S DRESS CODE CITED AS DISCRIMINATION: 'THIS IS RACIST AS HELL'\n\nIn a statement obtained by MarketWatch, a spokesperson for Anheuser-Busch said, \u201cCarson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him. We are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.\u201d\n\nAside from matching King\u2019s donation, Anheuser-Busch had previously pledged to send King a year\u2019s supply of beer with his face printed on the cans. It seems that this will no longer be happening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nKing posted a message on his Twitter page explaining and apologizing for the since-deleted tweets. After recapping the story-so-far (in which he claims to have raised $1.14 million for the Stead Family\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital in Iowa City), he explained how social media \u201chas the power to bring people together for a common good,\u201d but can \u201cmake your life very public.\u201d\n\nHis post continues, \u201c\u2026that is why I wanted to share you that eight years ago when I was a sophomore in high school, I made some social media posts with my friends that quoted and referenced the show Tosh.0. One of those posts was brought to my attention by a member of the media today. I had no recollection of it. In re-reading it today, eight years later, I see it was an attempt at humor that was offensive and hurtful.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe continued, \u201cI am embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16-years-old. I want to sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nThe post concludes, \u201cI am so very thankful for the generosity of the thousands of people who have donated to our fundraising push for the Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital.\u201d", "description": "Anheuser-Busch has reportedly cut ties with Carson King.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Carson-King-resize.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
