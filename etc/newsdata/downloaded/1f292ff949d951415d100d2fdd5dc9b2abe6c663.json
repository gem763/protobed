The BTC/USD pair traded above the $7,800 and $8,000 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the $8,200 resistance area. Finally, the price tested the $8,500 resistance area and topped near the $8,539 level. Recently, it started a fresh decline and traded below the $8,400 level.\n\nThe price is now following a bearish path below the $8,200 level and is trading well below the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,659 low to $8,539 high. At the moment, the price is holding the $8,000 support level, with a bearish angle. An immediate support is near $8,000. It coincides with the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,659 low to $8,539 high.\n\nMore importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance near $8,200 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin remains at a risk of more downsides below the $8,000 support area. If it breaks $8,000, it could decline towards the $7,850 support area. Any further downsides might trigger a move towards the $7,500 support area in the near term.\n\nOn the upside, there are many hurdles near the $8,200 and $8,300 levels. The first major resistance is near the $8,500 level. However, the main resistance is near the $8,600 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,600 on the same chart.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly following a bearish path below $8,500. As long as there is no close above $8,500 and $8,600, there is a risk of a sharp decline towards $7,500.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving into the bearish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is now well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $7,850\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $8,500", "description": "Bitcoin price is declining and is trading in a bearish zone below $8,500 against the US Dollar.
