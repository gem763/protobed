It advocated a \u201cbalanced\u201d scientific approach to climate-change study, giving much weight to those skeptical of the prevailing research, even as the broader science community was united.\n\n\u201cClimate deniers directly impact the scientific community \u2014 and, in turn, its ability to serve the public good \u2014 by forcing climate scientists to respond to bad-faith demands and arguably causing a chilling effect pressuring scientists to underplay scientific results,\u201d wrote George Mason\u2019s John Cook, Harvard\u2019s Geoffrey Supran and Australia-based Bristol\u2019s Stephan Lewandowsky and colleagues. The academic findings largely echo 2015 reporting by the Los Angeles Times and Inside Climate News that detailed ExxonMobil\u2019s anti-climate-change campaign.\n\nExxonMobil had previously dismissed much of the prevailing research as the work of anti-oil activists and paid media placement, although its own internal documents going back to the 1950s show that in-house scientists were explicitly aware of the potential dangers of human-caused climate change caused by their product. Exxon has more recently joined certain private sector-led global pledges to promote more energy sources.\n\nRead: Companies are too slow with shift to carbon neutral, say investors with $35 trillion at stake\n\nOn Tuesday, New York\u2019s lawsuit, which alleges the company misled investors, is set to go to trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. The trial is the culmination of an investigation into Exxon and its accounting practices covering four years and three New York attorneys general. It is expected to include as a witness former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was Exxon\u2019s chief executive from 2006 to 2016.\n\nThe suit said the company\u2019s misrepresentations caused investors to overvalue its stock. It estimated the damage to shareholders to be between $476 million and $1.6 billion. Exxon shares are up about 0.8% in the year to date, but down 8.4% in the past three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.21% is up 15% in 2019.\n\nExxon has denied wrongdoing and said a reasonable investor wouldn\u2019t expect to know such internal details, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company has also accused the attorneys general involved, all Democrats, of being motivated by politics, which the office has denied.\n\nThe company has created its own public relations campaign to address the #ExxonKnew controversy.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy has sent her own notice to Exxon of her office\u2019s intent to sue in civil court for violating the state\u2019s Consumer Protection Act \u201cby engaging in unfair or deceptive acts\u201d regarding the sale and branding of fossil fuel products.\n\nExxon\u2019s lawyers have asked the Superior Court of Massachusetts\u2019 Suffolk County to wait at least until the New York trial has ended.\n\nNew York\u2019s result could have major implications for the future of climate-related lawsuits.\n\nFederal judges have tossed out earlier climate-change cases, including when New York, San Francisco and other cities sued oil companies in the past several years to recoup costs incurred from the effects of rising global temperatures.", "description": "As ExxonMobil heads to court this week for a New York suit accusing it of misleading investors about climate change, a team of researchers at George Mason,...", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GC986_exxon0_ZG_20180202132705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
