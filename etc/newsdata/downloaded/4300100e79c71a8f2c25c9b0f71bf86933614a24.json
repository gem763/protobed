The coins could present broad systemic risks to global financial stability, they said, and catalyze illicit financial activity like money laundering. (Reuters)\n\nTalking point: The declarations mark the latest point of pressure on the embattled Libra Association, whose five major payment partners\u2014Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Stripe and Mercado Pago\u2014all recently quit the project. Dante Disparte, Libra\u2019s head of policy and communications, said it won\u2019t launch without regulatory approval, but a growing international consensus on the risks of fiat-tied digital coins like Libra seems to be pushing that possibility further out of reach. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on October 23, a meeting that will be closely watched by global regulators, as the CEO\u2014who has refused to appear at multiple international hearings\u2014will field questions on Libra, as well as Facebook\u2019s impact on financial services and housing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
