Before I jump into today\u2019s topic, let\u2019s catch up a bit. Last week, I wrote about Revel, a recent graduate of Y Combinator that\u2019s raised a small seed round.\n\nRemember, you can send me tips, suggestions and feedback to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or on Twitter @KateClarkTweets. If you don\u2019t subscribe to Startups Weekly yet, you can do that here.\n\nWhat happened this week?\n\nUber the TV show\n\nIs anyone surprised Mike Isaac\u2019s \u201cSuper Pumped\u201d is set to become a TV show? Travis Kalanick\u2019s notorious journey to CEO of Uber and subsequent ouster was made for television. This week, news broke that Showtime\u2019s Brian Koppelman and David Levien, the creators and showrunners of \u201cBillions,\u201d would develop the project, with Isaac himself on board to executive produce. I will be watching.\n\nAll Raise expansion\n\nAll Raise, an 18-month-old nonprofit organization that seeks to amplify the voices of and support women in tech, announced new chapters in Los Angeles and Boston this week. I spoke with leaders of the organization about expansion plans, new hires, product launches and more. \u201cWomen are hungry for the support and guidance we provide. I think the movement is just gathering momentum,\u201d All Raise CEO Pam Kostka told me.\n\nVCThe unicorn from down under\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Canva by now. The Australian tech company, which has developed a simplified graphic design tool, is worth a whopping $3.2 billion as of this week. Investors in the company include Bond, General Catalyst, Bessemer Venture Partners, Blackbird and Sequoia China. Alongside a fresh $85 million funding, Canva is also making its foray into enterprise with the launch of Canva for Enterprise. Read about that here.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe Station, TechCrunch\u2019s Kirsten Korosec\u2019s new weekly newsletter, has officially launched. She is going deep each week on all things mobility and transportation. You can read her first one here and subscribe here. \u2018Cloud kitchens\u2019 is an oxymoron, says TechCrunch editor Danny Crichton. He penned an interesting piece this week, arguing cloud kitchens are just adding more competition to one of the most competitive industries in the world, and that isn\u2019t a path to leverage. NASA made history this week when astronauts Christina H. Koch and Jessica Meir took part in the first-ever spacewalk in the agency\u2019s history featuring only women. No, this isn\u2019t startup-related but it\u2019s pretty damn cool. Watch the video here.\n\nVC deals\n\nStartup spotlight: Petalfox. I discovered the business earlier this week. Basically, it\u2019s a super easy way to order flowers, coffee and others goods via SMS. I\u2019m trying it out. That\u2019s all.\n\nEquity\n\nThis week was honestly a treat. We had myself in the studio along with Alex Wilhelm and a special guest, Sarah Guo from Greylock Partners, a venture firm (obviously). Guo has the distinction of having the best-ever fun fact on the show. We kicked off with Grammarly, a company that recently put $90 million into its accounts. Then chatted about Lattice, Tempest, WeWork, SaaS, the future of valuations in Silicon Valley and more if you can believe it.
