Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff \u2014 two of the leading voices behind Russia collusion, Russia obstruction of justice, Ukraine quid pro quo, impeach, impeach, impeach! \u2014 have turned coattails away from the Games of Politics they oh-so-normally love to play to tweet disparagingly about, get this, President Donald Trump\u2019s use of his White House platform for political revenge.\n\nHow delicious it is when the wicked are trapped within their own traps.\n\nHere\u2019s what House Judiciary Chairman Nadler said on Twitter, in reference to the Department of Justice\u2019s decision to look at the key players who kicked off the whole Russia collusion nonsense through criminal eyes: \u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the [p]resident with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nWow. That\u2019s a pot meet kettle moment, if ever there was one.\n\nIsn\u2019t Nadler the same guy who said just this past September that \u201cpersonally, I think the president ought to be impeached\u201d \u2014 without offering any evidence of impeachable offense? Yes, yes, indeed he was. And in that case: Where was his concern for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d then?\n\nNadler, on his Twitter feed, also wrote this: \u201cThese reports [of DOJ\u2019s criminal investigation] raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge.\u201d\n\nNadler made it clear his tweets were joint statements with Schiff. Which is another hoot, given Schiff\u2019s oversight of secret hearings in the Intelligence Committee he chairs.\n\nHonestly, calling out Barr and this Justice Department for political shenanigans brings a laugh list of hypocrisies. The previous administration practically perfected the art of political revenge. Can you say Eric Holder?\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice secretly obtained phone records for reporters and editors who work for the Associated Press news agency, including records for the home phones and cell phones of individual journalists,\u201d Wired wrote, back in March of 2013.\n\nEven The New York Times weighed in scathingly on that one, blasting in a headline, \u201cPhone Records of Journalists of The Associated Press Seized.\u201d\n\nThen there was that whole Holder v. Fox News affair, the one where the Barack Obama White House sought to know correspondent James Rosen\u2019s sources. And this is how it went down: \u201cU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder personally approved a decision to subpoena Fox News telephone records,\u201d Reuters wrote in 2013.\n\nThe story went on: \u201cThe revelation that Holder approved subpoenas that sought Fox News phone records shows that his involvement was broader than the Justice Department had earlier acknowledged publicly.\u201d\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo, too, that whole IRS-tea party non-profit application scandal \u2014 the one saw delays of tax exemptions to certain groups that were critical of Obama-era policies and that ultimately led to the departure of the acting IRS chief.\n\n\u201cObama Justice Department Was Involved In IRS Targeting, [Lois] Lerner Emails Reveal,\u201d wrote Forbes in a 2014 piece that included this bit: \u201c[T]he DOJ withheld over 800 pages of Lerner documents \u2026 [that showed] Lerner was talking to DOJ officials about prosecuting tax-exempt entities (yes, criminally!) two years before the IRS conceded there was inappropriate targeting.\u201d\n\nYikes.\n\nTalk about using a political stage for intimidation of U.S. citizens.\n\nNothing says shut up and sit down like threats from the IRS.\n\nBut such was the reputation of Holder and the previous administration.\n\n\u201cEric Holder,\u201d wrote Hans von Spakovsky, in a Heritage Foundation piece called \u201cEric Holder\u2019s legacy,\u201d published in April of 2015, \u201caggressively used the enormous power of the Justice Department to abuse the liberty and economic rights of Americans, to manipulate racial politics and drive a wedge of hostility deep into our society, and to exploit the administration of justice as a political tool to benefit his president and his political party.\u201d\n\nNow that\u2019s using a position of power to extract political revenge. Too bad Schiff and Nadler weren\u2019t so concerned about the politicization of the DOJ and the use of White House revenge politics back when Obama was president.\n\nThe stuff that could\u2019ve been prevented \u2026\n\nBut Attorney General Barr? He\u2019s not politicizing his investigation. He\u2019s not polluting the DOJ with partisan politics.\n\nBarr\u2019s only going after information the American people are dying to learn \u2014 and rightfully deserve to learn. After more than three years of investigating this president, and coming up with nothing, you\u2019d think Nadler and Schiff and the rest on the left might suffer at least a few weeks of investigation into the investigators. After all, if there\u2019s nothing to hide, why worry.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
