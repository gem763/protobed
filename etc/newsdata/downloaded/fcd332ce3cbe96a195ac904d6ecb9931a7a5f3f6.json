A data breach on the FIFA 20 Global Series registration page meant that the confidential information of an unknown number of players was free for others to see for multiple hours.\n\nPlayer Data Breach\n\nYesterday, EA opened up registrations for its latest eSports venture, FIFA 20 Global Series, this year\u2019s iteration of a season-long series of competitive events leading to the FIFA eWorld Cup.\n\nShortly afterward, players began reporting that they could access the details of other players who had already signed-up upon clicking the verification link sent to them after registering. The data included email addresses, gamer tags, country of residence, and date of birth.\n\nUsers took to Twitter to voice their concern;\n\nEA responded over four hours later with a tweet warning of a \u2018potential issue.\u2019 EA took down the registration page for the FIFA 20 Global Series soon after.\n\nHowever, the damage was already done. Twitter users reported desperately failing to regain ownership of their accounts via EA\u2019s two-factor-authorization system, and receiving unsolicited verification codes.\n\nEA Responds\n\nEarlier today, EA released a cookie-cutter statement on the breach, confirming the site had been shut down within 30 minutes of registration going live. The publisher explained it has found the cause of the data breach and implemented a fix to ensure the protection of personal data moving forward.\n\nEA estimates the breach affected 1600 FIFA 20 players. The company says;\n\nWe are taking steps to contact those competitors with more details and protect their EA accounts.\n\nThe statement continues;\n\nPlayer privacy and security are of the utmost importance to us, and we deeply apologize that our players encountered this issue today.\n\nGoing by yesterday\u2019s breach, this clearly isn\u2019t the case, and EA seemingly has little to no regard for confidential player data.\n\nRegistrations for the FIFA 20 Global Series will go live once again in the coming days. After the breach, enthusiasm for the event has likely waned in the interim.\n\nOne Twitter user pointed out that beyond opening up affected players to all manner of problems, as well as raising questions about what measures EA takes to protect user privacy, the company could be in for some trouble for breaching GDPR data protection laws. The gaming giant may have a hefty fine to settle.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Electronic-Arts-Stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
