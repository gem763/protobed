An adult resuscitation team from the intensive care unit were called in to take over as the journalist's body began shutting down.\n\n'They could not be certain if I was having a septic shock, an allergic reaction or the listeriosis had reached breaking point,' Mr Purcell said.\n\nMs Purcell knows its a miracle she survived. Her nurse and midwife both admitted after the fact they thought she would die.\n\nMs Purcell delivered her son, who she and her husband named Jude, moments after nearly losing her life due to the food-borne bacterial infection\n\n'About an hour after nearly losing my life, my uterus started contracting, preparing to deliver my son, Jude,' Ms Purcell said.\n\nWHAT IS THE SPANISH LISTERIA CRISIS? Three people are dead and at least 222 have been infected in Spain's largest ever outbreak of listeria. The food hygiene crisis originated from a roast pork factory in Seville, in the nation's south. Listeriosis is a food-borne bacterial infection which usually causes mild illness and can normally be treated with antibiotics. It can be fatal for people with weak immune systems, such as pregnant women, babies and the elderly. At least seven miscarriages may be linked to the outbreak.\n\nThe labor was relentless and exhausting.\n\n'Before I knew it, my darling boy had been delivered,' Ms Purcell said. 'His eyes closed, a tiny little nose and mouth, sweet little nails at the end of his tiny fingers.\n\n'Perfect in every way possible. He was the boy I had grown in my body for nearly six months and longingly loved his entire life.\n\n'But his feet are never going to walk this earth, my arms are never going to get to hold him tight, I'll never be able read him bedtime stories and I'll never hear him giggle.\n\n'The grief is unbearable and utterly consuming. I have so many questions and so many 'what if's'.'\n\nMs Purcell said she knows the grieving process will 'take a lot of time and some wounds will never heal.'\n\nShe thanked the people involved in saving her life throughout the ordeal and said there must have been more than 100 people who helped along the way.\n\nThe couple hope to get more answers over the coming months and say they are one of seven other couples whose babies have experienced a similar fate after contracting listeria in Spain.\n\nThe bacteria are deadly for people with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and pregnant women.", "description": "Brigitte Purcell and her husband spent close to two months abroad, celebrating a friend's wedding before travelling through Europe.
