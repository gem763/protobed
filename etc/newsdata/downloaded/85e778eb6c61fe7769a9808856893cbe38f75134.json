BEAT L.A.!!!\n\nSIREN \u2026 REPUBLICAN CONCERN RISING WITH TRUMP\u2019S REACTION TO IMPEACHMENT \u2026\n\nON TUESDAY NIGHT, a very seasoned and well-known GOP operative sent us this stunning note, underscoring GOP alarm with how the Trump administration is handling impeachment:\n\n-- \u201cGOP lawmakers and operatives are concerned at what appears to be a lack of urgency from the Trump administration in forming an organized, unified response engine to the Democratic impeachment threat. There is either a failure to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation; or an inability to protect the president like they did his Supreme Court nominees with a centralized war room that has credibility with stakeholders across the party.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to look like [Kevin] McCarthy did on \u201860 Minutes\u2019 and right now they\u2019ll duck and cover until they\u2019re on firmer footing. The Trump administration has blazed their own communications path up to this point, but there is deep skepticism that the late-night Fox lineup will have any credibility with rank-and-file Republicans that are necessary to prosecute this argument against House Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe case needs to be made that today\u2019s Democratic Party and their allies in the media have planned this since Election Day 2016 and they would be moving to impeach any Republican president under any circumstances. A hesitation to confront this threat with full force is forever waving a white flag. Unlike the Mueller probe, this is a political battle -- not a legal one. They need rapid response and credible, respected Republican voices, and they needed both yesterday.\u201d\n\nEXAMPLES OF TWO TYPES OF REACTION THAT ALARM REPUBLICANS \u2026\n\n-- THE PRESIDENT\u2019S TWEET, around 7:40 p.m.: \u201cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the........People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!\u201d\n\n-- THE ATLANTIC\u2019S ELAINA PLOTT (@efplott): \u201cRudy Giuliani says he is looking to sue The Swamp.\u201d Rudy\u2019s text message, saying he\u2019s going to sue \u201cthe swamp\u201d in federal court\n\nNEW \u2026 POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL: \u201cSupport for impeaching Trump hits new high,\u201d by Steven Shepard: \u201cA batch of recent polling confirms the Democratic impeachment push is gaining steam \u2014 including a new POLITICO/Morning Consult survey that shows for the first time that more voters support than oppose proceedings to remove Trump from office. The uptick is primarily among Democrats, as Republican voters surveyed continue to have Trump's back.\n\n\u201cIn the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, 46 percent of voters said Congress should begin impeachment proceedings vs. 43 percent who said they should not. Eleven percent had no opinion. That support represented a 3-point bump from last week, when voters were evenly split.\u201d POLITICO\n\nHAPPENING THIS A.M.: Speaker NANCY PELOSI will hold a press conference at 10:45 a.m., along with House Intel Chairman ADAM SCHIFF (D-Calif.). \u2026 HAPPENING THURSDAY: Kurt Volker will testify in front of House Intel, Foreign Affairs and Oversight.

Pete Sessions may be considering a comeback attempt \u2014 but not in his old Dallas-based district.\n\n\u201cSessions, who lost reelection last year, has emerged as a potential candidate for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Bryan. Flores has been meeting with potential candidates and sought feedback Tuesday from district activists on a potential Sessions run, according to an email obtained by The Texas Tribune Flores' 17th District includes Waco and is about 80 miles south of Sessions' old 32nd District. The 17th District is a much safer Republican district as well.\n\n\u201c\u2018A former Texas congressman and someone who I consider a friend (Pete Sessions), has been asked by some Republican donors to consider running in TX17 district,\u2019 Flores wrote. The incumbent added that \u2018while Pete has not called to ask for my thoughts,\u2019 he wanted to get feedback on Sessions\u2019 interest in the race.\n\n\u201cFlores emailed the Tribune on Tuesday night that the feedback \u2018has not been positive.\u2019 \u2018Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he\u2019d called me first,\u2019 he said. \u2018I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.\u2019 \u2018The conservative leaders and community leaders in the district who are aware of Pete\u2019s intentions have told me they would prefer someone who currently lives, works, and serves in our communities,\u2019 he added. \u2018They strongly believe that we have ample talent here to serve as their next congressman or congresswoman.\u2019\u201d Texas Tribune\n\nGood Wednesday morning.

As part of that effort, Attorney General William P. Barr has met overseas with foreign intelligence officials to enlist their aid in \u2018investigating the investigators,\u2019 as the right\u2019s rallying cry goes, and dig into the president\u2019s suspicions.\n\n\u201cThe State Department, meanwhile, has been investigating the email records of as many as 130 current and former department officials who sent messages to the private email account of Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defied Congress on Tuesday by attempting to block the depositions of five department employees called to testify in the impeachment inquiry.\u201d WaPo\n\nIMPEACHMENT CLIP PACKET \u2026\n\n-- BACKSTORY \u2026 WSJ: \u201cTense Relationship Between Barr and Giuliani Complicates Trump Impeachment Defense\u201d\n\n-- NYT\u2019S CARL HULSE pens an \u201cOn Washington\u201d piece: \u201cImpeachment Rules Say Senate Must Act, but Its Act Might Be a Swift Dismissal\u201d: \u201cSenator Mitch McConnell\u2019s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to \u2018take up\u2019 articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations.\n\n\u201cWhile the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have \u2018no choice\u2019 but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: \u2018How long you are on it is a whole different matter.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell\u2019s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think they could just duck it,\u2019 said Donald A. Ritchie, historian emeritus of the Senate. \u2018It is a constitutional responsibility. When you look at the weight of history, I think they would feel they have to do something. They would have to decide how abbreviated they wanted to make it.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\nPERRY GETS SOME ATTENTION \u2026 \u201cDemocrats turn eye to Rick Perry in Ukrainian probe,\u201d by Anthony Adragna and Ben Lefebvre: \u201cDemocrats investigating a whistleblower\u2019s allegations against President Donald Trump pressed Rick Perry on Tuesday for information about his May travels to Ukraine, opening a rare window into the energy secretary\u2019s role as an emissary for some of the administration\u2019s most sensitive international missions.\n\n\u201cSen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey posed the questions in a letter to Perry as House Democrats push forward with their impeachment inquiry into whether Trump used a July 25 phone to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival former Vice President Joe Biden. It comes as a widening array of administration officials face questions about their potential role in the affair, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Empowered women lift their entire communities, and we believe that creating opportunity leads to more opportunity.

He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\u201d\n\n-- TRUMP TO JARED: \u201cAll you care about is your friends in Mexico.\u201d\n\nDANIEL LIPPMAN and NATASHA BERTRAND: \u201cWhite House ordered top-secret system upgraded to prevent leaks\u201d: \u201cThe Trump White House upgraded the security of the National Security Council\u2019s top-secret codeword system in the spring of 2018, according to two former Trump White House officials familiar with the matter, as part of an effort to ferret out and deter leaks.\n\n\u201cThat highly classified system is being newly scrutinized in light of a whistleblower complaint alleging that national security officials used the system\u2014meant for storing information classified at the highest level\u2014to conceal politically embarrassing conversations, including a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 in which President Donald Trump urged Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The result is that consumers are seeking bigger loans than ever to purchase a car.\n\n\u201cA lending machine has revved up in response, making it possible for more Americans to procure a vehicle by spreading the debt over longer periods.
