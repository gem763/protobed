Nearly ten years now. Done. She's done my head in. I'm f*****.'\n\nPolice launched a nationwide manhunt for Foran who was captured on CCTV leaving Ms Jones' flat shortly after the murder.\n\nThey eventually received a tip-off and were able to arrest him after they found him begging outside a Poundland store in Liverpool.\n\nMother-of-three June Jones (pictured with Foran) was stabbed in the neck and heart on December 10 and her body lay undiscovered for three weeks\n\nIn a second phone call to his mother he made while in custody, Foran admitted: 'I put up for nearly ten years with her.\n\n'Through hell I went with that family. Through hell they put me through. I couldn't go outside the door without having an argument.\n\n'When I did snap, I did snap. That's what you get for it. She pushed me for years.\n\n'I am sorry for what I have done. I did not mean to do what I have done. They controlled me for 11 years. They broke me.\n\n'I couldn't even make a cup of tea in the house. They broke me. I had had enough.\n\n'I loved her but they broke me. Enough was enough.'\n\nForan had initially denied murder but today he changed his plea to guilty and was jailed for a minimum of 17 years at Wolverhampton Crown Court.\n\nA manhunt was launched for Foran after he was seen on CCTV with neighbour Keith O'Dwyer after leaving Ms Jones' flat shortly after the murder\n\nO'Dwyer drove Foran to Liverpool in his Range Rover (pictured). Police eventually received a tip-off and were able to arrest the murder suspect after they found him begging outside a Poundland store\n\nOne of his neighbours, Keith O'Dwyer, 35, was jailed for 16 months for assisting an offender after it was discovered that he had driven Foran to Liverpool in his Range Rover.\n\nAt the time neighbours had been shocked to hear about the crime and said Ms Jones was a young mother who lived in the flat with her partner and their baby.\n\nOne said: 'I heard banging at about 2am. It sounded like someone was banging my side window.\n\n'It was really loud and woke me. Then we heard shouting but I didn't get up to check anything.\n\nKeith O'Dwyer, 35, was jailed for 16 months for assisting an offender\n\n'I know the couple but they are very quiet. They just keep themselves to themselves. You never really see them.'\n\nMs Jones' family released a touching tribute to their daughter, who was known as Katie, after the sentencing.\n\nThey said: 'Today, justice has been done for our beloved Katie.\n\n'Finally, Michael Foran faced up to the gravity of the overwhelming evidence against him, forcing him to plead guilty to Katie's murder.\n\n'We as a family know that the guilty plea will never bring Katie back to us or justify the long term suffering he inflicted upon her and subsequently us.\n\n'We will always miss Katie and will know she will be forever in our hearts. We now as a family hope to move on now justice has been done and Katie can finally rest in peace.'\n\nDetective Inspector Nick Barnes, from the force's homicide team, said: 'Katie was murdered in the most horrific circumstances.\n\n'The level of violence used by Foran was despicable. Knowing what he'd done, he left Katie in her flat and carried on with his life.\n\n'When he realised police had discovered Katie's body, he fled in an effort to evade capture.\n\nForan had been hiding nearby to watch the police kick down the front door minutes before they found his girlfriend's body in the 'blood spattered' bathroom\n\nAt the time neighbours had been shocked to hear about the crime and said Ms Jones was a young mother who lived in the flat with her partner and their baby\n\n'He clearly didn't want to take responsibility for his actions and thought he could get away from police.\n\n'I hope his acknowledgement of guilt offers some comfort to Katie's family, who have been extremely brave throughout this traumatic time.\n\n'My thoughts remain with them as they come to terms with their loss.'", "description": "Michael Foran admitted to killing his girlfriend at their home in West Bromwich, West Midlands.
