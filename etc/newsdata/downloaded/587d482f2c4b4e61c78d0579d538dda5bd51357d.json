The desire to give squad players game time saw the inclusion of Mohamed Elyounoussi along with Hatem Abd Elhamed, Jonny Hayes, Craig Gordon, Lewis Morgan, Rogic and Bayo.\n\nOut or onto the bench went Fraser Forster, Bauer, Christopher Jullien, Boli Bolingoli, Scott Brown, James Forrest, Ryan Christie and Odsonne Edouard. Included amongst the Hoops substitutes was Sinclair, whose last showing was an 11-minute cameo in the 5-2 victory over Motherwell at Fir Park on August 10.\n\nThe personnel switches did not prevent Celtic from getting off to their customary strong start and it became apparent immediately that Bayo was the beacon for crosses from both the Celtic flanks. Hayes was the principal supplier and his first delivery was met by the Ivorian striker with a header that looped on to the roof of the net.\n\nStory continues\n\nBayo used the effort to adjust his range so that, when Hayes next found him with a free kick, he got clear of Ryan Williamson in the heart of the Jags box to bounce his headed finish powerfully beyond Scott Fox. The 22-year-old forward got yet another chance when Rogic picked him out just beyond Fox\u2019s right hand post but on this occasion Bayo bounced his attempt just on the wrong side of the upright.\n\nOlivier Ntcham scored twice to help his side defeat Partick Thistle Credit: Getty Images\n\nWhen Sean McGinty trudged off to have his bleeding skull patched, it looked as though Thistle could expect nothing from the evening but the Firhill players settled into a tidy passage during which they sustained possession to a degree which saw them create a decent opening for an equaliser, when Shea Gordon struck an angled drive which forced his goalkeeping namesake to beat the ball to safety.\n\nIf the Jags made their way inside at the interval satisfied that they could make an impact on the proceedings, they were disabused within 45 seconds of the restart when Bayo laid off a pass for Rogic to find the mark from the edge of the box. Salt was applied to the visitors\u2019 wounds when an offside flag ruled out a beautifully glanced header from Tam O\u2019Ware and, while Thistle were still grumbling, they were picked off by Ntcham with a raking drive that reached the net via Fox\u2019s fingertips.\n\nThe Frenchman added another shortly afterwards, this time taking the low road when his shot deceived McGinn and went in off the base of the far post with Fox unsighted. Thistle\u2019s torment was not over, however, and the next punishment was inflicted by Sinclair, who had replaced Elyounoussi midway through the second half, fastened on to the rebound from a blocked attempt by Bayo to rifle home Celtic\u2019s fifth and final goal.", "description": "Celtic swept past Partick Thistle and into the semi-finals\u00a0with an ominous statement of intent in the Betfred Scottish League Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YnHqiVYRrwn4ovfNM.uHjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZwD.R86cBjXmvFDJs15x8A--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/07c895609ee614ffd4ef806cfcca8368", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
