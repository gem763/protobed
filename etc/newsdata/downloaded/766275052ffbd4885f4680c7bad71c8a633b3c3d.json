Is it ideal that they found out through different means? No, it\u2019s not ideal.\n\n\u201cBut, actually, the decision to tell a grieving family is something we will reflect on and if Charlotte and Tim have been upset by that delay that is something I am prepared to apologise for \u2013 but it is a decision I would still support.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, have made repeated pleas for Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK to \u201cface justice\u201d, while Mr Seiger has accused the authorities of \u201cfurther compounding the family\u2019s misery\u201d through \u201ccontradictory\u201d actions.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference at the force\u2019s headquarters, Mr Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas was \u201cutterly devastated\u201d and had asked to be interviewed by UK police officers in the US.\n\nHe said: \u201cLawyers have clearly stated that the suspect wants to be personally interviewed by officers from Northamptonshire Police in order for them to see her and the devastation this has caused her and her family.\n\n\u201cShe did not want to provide a pre-prepared statement, which is her right to do so. We do understand from colleagues in the US that the family is utterly devastated.\u201d\n\nHe said the force was awaiting the necessary visas before officers could travel to the US but that the suspect, whom he did not actually name, would be interviewed under caution once that could take place.\n\nMr Adderley went on: \u201cFrom the police\u2019s point of view, we have to make sure we maintain the integrity of all of the evidence and that it is not skewed by it (the diplomatic immunity debate) to ensure a fair trial should we get to an extradition position and she comes back to the UK.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to jeopardise that by not affording her a fair trial.\u201d\n\nMr Adderley called on Mr Seiger to consider his behaviour.\n\nHarry Dunn was killed near RAF Croughton on August 27 (Family handout/PA)\n\nHe said: \u201cI urge the family spokesman to exercise constraint in his commentary as the case moves forward. I understand the emotion and I understand the anxiety.\n\n\u201cI also understand the will and the want for answers to questions the family are asking.\n\n\u201cI have offered to go and see the family on two occasions now and on both occasions that has not been able to happen.\u201d\n\nHe said that was due to information being requested by Mr Seiger which police were unable to share for legal reasons.\n\nHe also denied that the investigation had slowed down and said he was willing to meet the family \u201cany place and at any time\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe suspect not being in the county clearly frustrates the investigation but it does not stop it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Dunn family are due to meet shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry in Westminster on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHarry\u2019s mother said earlier on Tuesday that the family have been fed \u201cone lie after another\u201d by the British and US Governments and Northamptonshire Police.", "description": "Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, is accused of killing 19-year-old Harry Dunn in a crash in August.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/wire-20037476-1571751840-288_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
