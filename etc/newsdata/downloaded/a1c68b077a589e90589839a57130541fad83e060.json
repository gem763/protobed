Pictured: Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBut in a separate signed letter to the EU, the PM described a delay as 'deeply corrosive' and would 'damage the interests' of both sides.\n\nHe vowed that the UK would continue to ratify the deal and said EU should do the same.\n\nMr Johnson seemed to have the support of French President Emmanuel Macron, who said that a Brexit delay would be 'in the interest of no one'.\n\nAt precisely 2.50pm yesterday, when Britain might finally have hoped to move ahead with Brexit , Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured) announced that MPs had again voted \u2013 by 322 to 306 \u2013 for more delays to the seemingly interminable process\n\nBefore his ploy was revealed, Mr Johnson told a febrile Commons: 'I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to.'\n\nHe said he would bring legislation forward tomorrow and call a new Commons vote on the deal he dramatically secured in Brussels last week.\n\nOn a day of high political drama at Westminster:\n\nSir Oliver and fellow Tory rebels faced a furious backlash for sabotaging the 'super Saturday' plan to finally end the country's Brexit nightmare, as he faced claims that he had acted in cahoots with a pro-Remain lawyer;\n\nHopes rose that Mr Johnson could muster a majority for his Brexit plans after Labour MPs and Tory rebels indicated they could vote for his deal after he asked for a delay;\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel contacted the six Labour MPs who voted with the Government to offer help with their security amid reports that they had received violent threats; lSpeaker Bercow hinted that he might prevent the Government from holding a binding vote on the deal this week;\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn faced a new civil war over claims that he secretly hoped to lose the vote;\n\nMPs said they would try to introduce new laws to ban 'collusion' between foreign governments and the Commons over the drafting of legislation, following claims that Sir Oliver and other members of the so-called 'rebel alliance' had received help from abroad;\n\nThousands of campaigners for a second referendum marched in London, as The Mail on Sunday obtained leaked emails implicating Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell in a Blairite takeover of the organisation behind it;\n\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was heckled by the protesters as he walked through Westminster with his young son Peter;\n\nNigel Farage rejected an attempt to 'buy off' his opposition to the PM's deal with a peerage.\n\nSir Oliver's amendment that activated the Benn Act was backed by Labour MPs and ten former Tory rebels, including ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond and former Justice Secretary David Gauke.\n\nIt was also supported by the DUP after Mr Johnson's last-ditch meetings with the Unionists failed to change their minds.\n\nThe vote flew in the face of opinion polls showing strong public support for MPs to back the deal and finally resolve the Brexit saga.\n\nDuring angry scenes in the first Commons Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War, Mr Corbyn demanded that the Prime Minister should 'obey the law' and ask the EU for an extension.\n\nBut last night, No 10 ordered Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Permanent Representative in Brussels, to convey a total of three letters.\n\nOne was photocopy of the letter set out in the Benn Act which asks the EU to delay Brexit \u2013 which was not signed by Boris Johnson.\n\nThe second was a covering letter from Sir Tim making clear that the request was from Parliament, not the Government.\n\nOn their historic Saturday sitting, MPs voted for an amendment tabled by former Cabinet Minister Sir Oliver Letwin (pictured), which means the Commons must further debate the Prime Minister's Brexit deal\n\nThe third was a signed letter by Mr Johnson \u2013 which was also being sent to the leaders of the 27 other EU nations \u2013 in which he distanced himself from the first letter by making clear that he strongly opposes any delay to Brexit.\n\nAfter Mr Johnson said he would introduce legislation and call a new vote, Mr Bercow \u2013 who has been accused of 'stitching up' Commons business to help Remainers \u2013 complained he had been 'blindsided' and suggested he might rule it out of order.\n\nThe Prime Minister told the Commons that the Brexit issue must not be allowed to 'consume' Westminster any more. 'The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three-and-a-half years after the nation voted for Brexit.\n\n'And during those years, friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.\n\nSir Oliver's amendment that activated the Benn Act was backed by Labour MPs and ten former Tory rebels, including ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond (pictured) and former Justice Secretary David Gauke\n\n'But I hope that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us.'\n\nHowever, despite the defeat, hopes in Downing Street rose that Mr Johnson will eventually have the numbers to pass his Brexit deal.\n\nThe 306 who voted with the Government yesterday included all 283 currently serving Conservative MPs and 11 of the 21 Tories expelled by Mr Johnson last month.\n\nAnd some of the Tory rebels who voted with Mr Letwin \u2013 including Mr Gauke and Nick Boles \u2013 have indicated that they would support the deal after the extension had been requested.\n\nIn a further boost, the numbers voting for Mr Johnson's deal yesterday were swelled by six Labour MPs and five former Labour MPs who sit as independents.\n\nOther Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell, suggested that they would vote for a deal in the future, indicating Mr Johnson has a path to a majority when he attempts a fresh vote this week.\n\nGovernment whips are confident they can get 'double figures' of Labour MPs to support the Brexit deal next time, hitting the crucial Commons majority target of 320.", "description": "At precisely 2.50pm yesterday, when Britain might finally have hoped to move ahead with Brexit, John Bercow said MPs had again voted for more delays to the seemingly interminable process.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor", "Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937564-0-image-a-38_1571519599425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
