It was a fitting conclusion to an entertaining series and WNBA season.\n\nThis was the seventh series in league history that had gone to a deciding Game 5, and the home team has won five of them.\n\nDelle Donne, who has been dealing with a herniated disk in her back, scored four points during a decisive 8-0 run that gave the Mystics an 80-72 lead with under three minutes left. But it was Meesseman, the soft-spoken Belgian who unveiled a new, aggressive \"Playoff Emma\" persona during the title run, who was named MVP of the Finals.\n\nElena Delle Donne #11 of Washington Mystics celebrates after the Mystics defeated the Connecticut Sun to win the 2019 WNBA Finals at St Elizabeths East Entertainment & Sports Arena on October 10, 2019 in Washington, DC.

I'm their teammate (and did what) I need to do help my team win a championship. This is my family right here,\" she said.\n\nDelle Donne came to Washington three years ago in a trade from Chicago, hoping to get the Mystics their first title. She grew up about an hour from the city in Delaware and wanted to be closer to home. She's been battling injuries and illnesses all season, breaking her nose early in the year. She still wears a mask to protect it. Delle Donne also wears a knee brace on her right knee after suffering a bone bruise in last year's Finals.\n\nThe victory gave coach Mike Thibault his first WNBA championship. The league's all-time winningest coach had reached the Finals three times in his career \u2014 twice with Connecticut \u2014 and last season with Washington, but fell short each time.", "description": "This was the seventh series in league history that had gone to a deciding Game 5, and the home team has won five of them", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/c21a8547-4583-4d8a-b351-fa89d73e815d/thumbnail/1200x630/b7321ec35f5f2b857ef2108a83da4258/gettyimages-1180332859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
