Zuerlein hit three field goals earlier, but his final attempt slipped wide right and gave Seattle (4-1) a win they needed against their NFC West foe after losing six of the past eight to the Rams.\n\nWilson was 17 of 23 for 268 and four touchdowns. He was at his best, whether it was his throws from the pocket or when he was forced to improvise. It was one stunning play after another from Seattle\u2019s star, continuing the best start to a season in his career. \u201cI thought Russell played one of the best games I\u2019ve ever seen him play,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said.\n\nEven his opponents were left in awe. \u201cRussell Wilson is playing out of his mind right now,\u201d Rams safety Eric Weddle said.\n\nSeattle appeared to wrap up the victory when Tedric Thompson made a juggling interception of Goff\u2019s deflected pass while lying on the turf with 2:08 left. But the Rams forced Seattle to punt and took possession at their own seven with 1:38 left.\n\nIn just seven plays, Goff had the Rams to the Seattle 30 after a 28-yard strike to Gerald Everett. The Rams stalled and a nine-yard pass to Everett on third-down set up Zuerlein\u2019s attempt. The snap was good, but the kick stayed just to the right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one kick. He\u2019s made a lot of big kicks for us. He\u2019s going to continue to make a lot of big kicks for us,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. Goff finished 29 of 49 for 395 yards and one touchdown just days after throwing for a career-high 517 yards and tying an NFL record with 45 completions in a loss to Tampa Bay. Everett had seven catches for 136 yards, and Cooper Kupp had nine grabs for 118 yards and a TD.\n\nWilson, though, was the star.\n\n", "description": "Greg Zuerlein missed a 44-yard field goal with 11 seconds left and the Seahawks held on for a wild 30-29 victory over the Los Angeles Rams", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff363209ed2e18681c77901f4285b3a1f173eca/0_71_5086_3053/master/5086.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d85729a7bc681a4335d3587dc226fed9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
