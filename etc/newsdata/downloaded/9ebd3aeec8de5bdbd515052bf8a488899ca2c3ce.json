Sulzberger told a story about an Egypt-based Times reporter nearly getting arrested in August 2017.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s intended to \u201csit on the information\u201d rather than intervening, Sulzberger said.\n\nHere is what Sulzberger said about the incident and its precedent in full:\n\nTwo years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we\u2019ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.\n\nBut this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn. We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger.\n\nWalsh, who is currently the Cairo bureau chief for the Times, was not arrested, according to Sulzberger, who lamented that the Times was \u201cunable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned.\u201d Instead, diplomats from Walsh\u2019s home country of Ireland were able to escort him to an airport.\n\nAlso Read: New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol Shuts Down\n\n\u201cUnable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned,\u201d he said.\n\nA representative for the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOn Twitter, Walsh reacted to Sulzberger telling the story publicly for the first time and subsequently publishing his remarks as an article. Walsh wrote, \u201cThe incident occurred in August 2017 after @NYTmag published my story about Giulio Regeni, an Italian student found dead in Cairo. Italy accuses Egypt of involvement, and Egypt denies. It\u2019s a sensitive issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t received that timely warning. Possibly nothing, and possibly a major problem. The workings of Egypt\u2019s security apparatus are notoriously opaque under Mr. el-Sisi, even to Egypt experts,\u201d he added. \u201cLastly, I owe a belated thanks an Irish diplomat who rushed to help in a tight spot. He was cool, swift and fearless. And to someone in Washington who took a risk to reach out.\u201d\n\nRead original story Trump Administration \u2018Intended to Sit on\u2019 Plan for Egypt to Arrest NY Times Reporter, Publisher Says At TheWrap", "description": "During a speech at Brown University on Monday, New York Times publisher A.G.
