I've been here for almost three years, it's my fourth season, and that makes me want to play more,\" Jesus told Esporte Interativo last week.\n\n\"Obviously it's very hard to compete for a place with Aguero, the biggest legend of this club.\n\n\"I do understand Pep's decisions and respect Sergio, his history here and what he's doing now.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAguero is off to another lightning-fast start with City this season, having scored eight goals in just seven Premier League appearances thus far in 2019-20.\n\nCity are looking to make it three straight league titles this season, but currently sit in second place, five points behind Liverpool.\n\nGuardiola's side take on Wolves in league action on Sunday before they face Crystal Palace on October 19 following the international break.", "description": "The Brazilian has been linked with a move to the Bundesliga champions but shut down that talk with a response on Instagram", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7TB.5_MQ9MRmeMtmXCtylA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pWYmpsGGTzCQqzzq2YDL_A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/be2417ba594de902dba936ae3a338992", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
