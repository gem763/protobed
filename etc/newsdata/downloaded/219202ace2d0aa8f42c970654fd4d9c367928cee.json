We learned yesterday that a key witness who testified at the trial was shot dead on Friday. But Joshua Brown had time to call the police before he expired, letting them know what happened. A few details have been released, but there is still no suspect in custody as of this morning.\n\nA neighbor who testified in the murder trial of former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was fatally shot Friday night at a Dallas apartment complex, police said Saturday. Civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt, who represented Jean\u2019s family, tweeted Saturday that Brown\u2019s mother asked him \u201cto help find out who murdered her son.\u201d Without mentioning Brown by name, the Dallas Police Department said in a news release that a shooting victim had called police about 10:37 p.m. Friday and later died at a hospital.\n\nThis killing is raising obvious questions in the media and among the public, but with so few details available we shouldn\u2019t be jumping to any conclusions yet. It\u2019s certainly tragic, but also odd that a witness in such a high-profile trial would be gunned down within days of the trial\u2019s conclusion, but if you\u2019re trying to silence a witness you would generally want to do it before they testify, right?\n\nThe police report that Brown was at an apartment complex roughly six miles away from the one where Guyger and Jean lived. He\u2019s also described as having been a neighbor of Jean\u2019s, but a separate report indicates that he\u2019s since moved to the new location. Since he was on the phone with the cops before he died, if he knew his assailant we might assume that the person would either already be in custody or at least be being sought as a person of interest.\n\nStill, it\u2019s entirely possible that this was some random act of violence and/or robbery that just turns out to be a tragic coincidence.\n\nI\u2019ve been following the Guyger story for a while, but haven\u2019t written about it. There\u2019s a lot to digest, but frankly, I still don\u2019t understand how the prosecution managed to obtain a murder conviction. I\u2019m not saying Guyger should have got off scot-free in this case and could certainly see her going down for manslaughter of some sort. But murder?\n\nMurder implies intent of some sort, even if it\u2019s a spur of the moment decision. This report has most of the details that came out during the trial and I\u2019m not seeing it. To my knowledge, nobody has even suggested that Guyger even knew Botham Jean, to say nothing of having some sort of beef with him leading her to want him dead. She\u2019d been working heavy overtime shifts and was exhausted when heading home.\n\nShe parks on the wrong floor of her apartment complex garage, gets out and walks to the door on that floor corresponding to her own. The door\u2019s lock is damaged so it can just be pushed open, leading her to believe someone might have burglarized her home. Pushing the door open, she sees a man she doesnt\u2019 know inside. From that point a series of very bad decisions are made to be sure and Jean winds up dead. Guyger handled the entire thing horribly and is clearly responsible for Jean\u2019s death. But was it murder? It just sounds like a series of tragic mistakes.\n\nIn any event, hopefully the Dallas PD will identify and bring in the person or persons who shot Brown. Once their identity is known we should have a better idea of whether this was an act of revenge in some way related to the trial or yet another tragic coincidence.", "description": "Suspicious to say the least", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/guyger.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
