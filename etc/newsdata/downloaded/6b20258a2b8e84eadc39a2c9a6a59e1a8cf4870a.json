He was a bad person, I guess,\" said one female student.\n\n\"I don't like the idea of someone taking credit for, like, a death,\" another student said.\n\nAppearing on \"Fox & Friends: First\" Wednesday with host Heather Childers, Neret said that students' hatred for the president prevents them from looking at the situation objectively, calling some of the responses \"insane.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNeret said Campus Reform has covered stories where \"professors are out on the record telling students President Trump is like Hitler.
