The pound and U.K. banking stocks surged.\n\nAfter meeting with his U.K. counterpart Stephen Barclay on Friday, Barnier told ambassadors from the 27 member states there has been enough progress for talks to enter the so-called \u201ctunnel.\u201d That\u2019s the process by which the two sides discuss drafts of the legal text in secret. If the ambassadors give their approval, it would be the first time such line-by-line negotiations have taken place since Boris Johnson became U.K. prime minister.\n\nThe move follows Thursday\u2019s meeting between Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar in which the two leaders said they could see a pathway to a deal. It isn\u2019t clear what concessions were offered to break the deadlock.\n\nJohnson had proposed to take Northern Ireland out of the EU\u2019s customs union and give Northern Ireland\u2019s Assembly a veto over the deal. He may now water down the veto and suggest a so-called customs partnership instead.\n\nThe two sides need to reach an agreement before next week\u2019s EU summit and Johnson\u2019s own Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave. Any agreement would also have to be backed by Parliament in London.\n\nAny attempt to change Johnson\u2019s plans may run into opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party, which has so far not commented. Without a majority in Westminster, Johnson is reliant on the unionist party support to pass any legislation. Johnson has briefed DUP Leader Arlene Foster about his proposals, a U.K. official said on Friday.\n\nIn the market, many are taking these developments to be a game-changer: the pound jumped by the most over two days since 2009, while U.K. bank stocks and domestically focused equities soared. Sterling\u2019s jump may catch out hedge funds and asset managers that have amassed a near-record short position on the British currency, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Edward Evans in London at eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Heather Harris at hharris5@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The Brexit negotiations inched forward with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, recommending that detailed negotiations can begin in earnest.
