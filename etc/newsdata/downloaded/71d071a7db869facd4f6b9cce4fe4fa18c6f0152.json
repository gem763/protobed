In 2008, more than 50 years later, she told a historian that her allegations against Emmett were false. Emmett, who was from Chicago, had been visiting his mother\u2019s family in Mississippi that summer when he was dragged out of their home in the night. His body was found near the river bed in Glendora, Mississippi where a makeshift memorial was put up, then defaced, then put up, then defaced, then shot with bullet holes, until this past week, a new bullet-proof steel sign was put in place.\n\nLynching is not a word to be used lightly: From 1882 to 1968, 4,743 lynchings occurred in the U.S., according to the NAACP. Of those men, women, and children we know of who were hanged, burned alive, shot, drowned, and beaten to death, 3,446 were black. And these are just the ones we know about.", "description": "For the president to compare his impeachment to a lynching is a national disgrace.", "authors": ["Sophia A.
