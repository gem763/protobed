This is a pre-election party political broadcast by the Prime Minister.\n\nLisa Nandy, who is seen as a bellweather of a group of opposition backbenchers in Leave seats, said she was still willing to break her party whip to support a deal, but not this one\n\nMs Nandy said: 'For all the talk of getting Brexit done we are further from a deal than we were two months ago when he (Boris Johnson, pictured) became Prime Minister'\n\n'For all the talk of getting Brexit done we are further from a deal than we were two months ago when he became Prime Minister.'\n\nHer distance from the PM's position will come as a blow as without a majority Mr Johnson will need Labour rebels to break the party whip and support his deal in order to get it through the Commons.\n\nIt came after the Sun reported that Mr Johnson would abandon a pledge to maintain a 'level playing field' with EU standards after Brexit in order to get trade deals.\n\nWorkplace protection was one of the areas suggested where there could be divergence, with Trade Minister Liz Truss tweeting that such a move was 'vital for giving us the freedom and flexibility to strike new trade deals and become more competitive.'\n\nMs Nandy added that Mr Johnson was 'not behaving like a PM who is at all serious'.\n\n'What he is ding is wasting time and running down the clock as we approach No deal,' she added.\n\nLast week Jeremy Corbyn ordered his Labour MPs to frustrate Boris Johnson's 'reckless' attempt to secure a Brexit deal and get the UK out of the EU.\n\nThe opposition leader laid out the command in the Commons amid claims by some backbenchers in Leave-voting areas that as many as 30 of his MPs would be prepared to support the Government's plan to get Brexit done.\n\nTory Spartans also rallied behind the Prime Minister as he claimed his Brexit blueprint can 'bridge the chasm' with the EU.\n\nRunning the gauntlet of the House of Commons, the PM said he had put forward a 'serious' blueprint that can win over a majority of MPs, again warning that the only alternative was No Deal.\n\nHe was bolstered by support from hardliners, who hailed 'progress' in the talks. The DUP and some Labour moderates have also signalled they are on board.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn made clear he is determined to order his loyalist MPs to block the proposals if they ever come to Parliament.\n\n'No Labour MP could support such a reckless deal that will be used as a springboard to attack rights and standards in this country,' he said.", "description": "Lisa Nandy, who is seen as a bellweather of a group of opposition backbenchers in Leave seats, said she was still willing to break her party whip to support a deal, but not this one", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/09/19355742-0-image-a-12_1570349775972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
