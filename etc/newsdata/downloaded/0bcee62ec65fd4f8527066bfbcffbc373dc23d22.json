It was his fifth career submission win.\n\nPrior to the fight, Mowry thought he was getting close to title contention. Now he\u2019s confident that while he\u2019s still improving, he will one day be considered one of the greatest fighters in the sport.\n\n\u201cNot today, maybe not tomorrow, but there\u2019s going to be a time when Steve Mowry\u2019s name is synonymous with one of the best of all time,\u201d Mowry said after the fight at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.\n\nAfter getting tagged up a little bit on the feet, Mowry reverted back to his grappling and took the fight to the canvas. He was able to drag the fight back to the mat again in Round 2 and eventually secured the submission finish.\n\nWhile he may not have gotten the chance to test his striking like he wanted to, Mowry knows it\u2019s still a learning process for him.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to test myself in the standup,\u201d Mowry said. \u201cI fight good strikers. I take them down. I submit them. So I\u2019d tell you, if I fight a good grappler, I\u2019m going to put hands on him. Hat\u2019s off to him \u2013 he came in and did everything he thought he could do to get a victory. I felt like I was a step better. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a good kickboxer, and he\u2019s a good boxer. Obviously he did good work whenever we were on the feet.\n\n\u201cSean Soriano, one of my mentors, one of the striking coaches at the gym, I told him, \u2018I swear to God, maybe not this fight, maybe not the next fight, but I swear to God it\u2019s going to come together.\u2019 I\u2019m going to learn to punch and kick people effectively, and I\u2019m going to beat people up, and it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m going to be a complete MMA fighter. I promise you guys.\u201d\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s win, Mowry is one step closer to his title hopes and will be keeping an eye on how the rest of the division plays out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in the heavyweight division, especially with Bellator,\u201d Mowry said. \u201cWe have a lot of up-and-coming guys fighting each other, and then obviously we have the distinguished, established heavyweights duking it out with each other. So it\u2019ll be really interesting, especially after today (and Saturday\u2019s) events, to see like where the dust settles and where everybody falls into place.\u201d", "description": "Undefeated Steve Mowry vows to be remembered as one of the greatest of all time after his win at Bellator 231 kept him undefeated.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/steve-mowry-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
