The Post has insisted that its reporting was fair and accurate.\n\nAll three flagged statements from the newspaper\u2019s coverage refer to Omaha Nation elder Nathan Phillips being blocked or impeded by Nicholas, a student at Covington Catholic High School, during their viral encounter at the Lincoln Memorial stairs.\n\n\u201cThe Court will adhere to its previous rulings as they pertain to these statements except Statements 10, 11, and 33, to the extent that these three statements state that plaintiff \u2018blocked\u2019 Nathan Phillips and \u2018would not allow him to retreat,\u2019\u201d said Judge Bertelsman in his Monday order.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that the Court has given this matter careful review and concludes that \u2018justice requires\u2019 that discovery be had regarding these statements and their context. The Court will then consider them anew on summary judgment,\u201d he said.\n\nAttorney Todd V. McMurtry, who represents the Sandmann family with attorney L. Lin Wood, called the judge\u2019s order a \u201chuge victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sandmann family and our legal team are grateful that Judge Bertelsman has allowed the case to proceed,\u201d said Mr. McMurtry in an email. \u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling preserves the heart of the Nicholas Sandmann\u2019s claims. We can consider this a huge victory and look forward to initiating discovery against the Washington Post.\u201d\n\nNEWSFLASH: Federal Judge William O. Bertelsman partially reversed his ruling to dismiss #nicksandmann\u2019s claims against the @washingtonpost. Nick\u2019s case may now proceed into discovery. The ruling bodes will for the NBC and CNN cases, as well. @LLinWood pic.twitter.com/4MoJdSreXa \u2014 Todd V. McMurtry (@ToddMcMurtry) October 28, 2019\n\nAs a prepare for summary judgment hearing today in LA in Vernon Unsworth v. Elon Musk, the news of our team\u2019s huge win in Covington, KY reaffirms my career-long belief that our system of justice works. Nicholas Sandmann deserves his day in court against WaPo. Now he will get it. \u2014 Lin Wood (@LLinWood) October 28, 2019\n\nThe Sandmann attorneys have also filed separate $275 million defamation lawsuits against CNN and NBCUniversal for their coverage of the incident. Both media organizations have also denied defaming the Covington teen and filed motions to dismiss.\n\nNicholas was portrayed initially on social media as harassing and blocking Mr. Phillips until lengthier video showed the older man approaching the group of Covington Catholic boys and wading into their cheer circle as they waited for their bus to return to Kentucky.\n\nSome of those who accused Nicholas of bullying and \u201csmirking\u201d at Mr. Phillips later apologized. The Diocese of Covington in Covington, Kentucky, issued an apology to the boys after initially saying that they would be subject to discipline, including expulsion.\n\nThe three statements identified by the court were:\n\nA quote in three articles from Mr. Phillips saying that Nicholas \u201cjust blocked my way and wouldn\u2019t allow me to retreat,\u201d a statement attributed to Mr. Phillips saying that the teen \u201cwas blocking him from moving,\u201d and a tweet using the quote from Mr. Phillips saying that Nicholas \u201cjust blocked my way and wouldn\u2019t allow me to retreat.\u201d\n\nIn his July 26 dismissal, Judge Bertelsman said that the older man had a First Amendment right to \u201coffer his subjective point of view, and the Post had a right to report it.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Washington Post declined to comment.\n\n\u201cNicholas Sandmann deserves his day in court against WaPo. Now he will get it,\u201d tweeted Mr. Wood.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
