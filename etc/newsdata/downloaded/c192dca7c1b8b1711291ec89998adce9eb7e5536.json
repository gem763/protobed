No-one is bigger than the club.\u2019\n\nLukaku left United for Inter Milan over the summer (Picture: Getty)\n\nBut Souness believes that it is Woodward himself who is to blame for failing to give his manager the tools to succeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If I was Ed Woodward I would have splashed the cash. United have had more misses than hits in their big-money signings in the past five years, but without proven performers at elite level it\u2019s hard to see how they can scale the summit in the next five years,\u2019 Souness added.\n\n\u2018Failing to bring in a 20-goals-a-season striker when Romelu Lukaku departed in the summer sums up the flaw in their strategy.\n\n\u2018Maybe Woodward doesn\u2019t like the fact that selling clubs increasingly see United as a cash cow.\n\n\u2018Gary Neville keeps telling me that United are going in a different direction from the one they took in the six years after Sir Alex Ferguson stood down.\n\n\u2018I assume he means they are going to put their faith in a young manager and young players.\n\n\u2018Good luck with that because I can\u2019t see that direction taking them back to the top of the mountain.\u2019", "description": "Graeme Souness reckons Manchester United beating Liverpool would be one of the biggest upsets in recent history.
