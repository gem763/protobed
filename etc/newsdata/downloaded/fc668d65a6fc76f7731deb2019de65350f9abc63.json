Impressive as her stunt was, it\u2019s part of a long lineage of both groups and individuals fucking up fashion shows for the sake of both political and personal clout. As a toast to S\u2019Infiltre\u2019s gusto, here\u2019s a run-through of seven of the most memorable runway stormings in recent times.\n\n\n\nFemen at Nina Ricci\n\nWell known for staging bare-chested actions in places like The Vatican\u2019s St Peter\u2019s Square, or Maidan Square in Kyiv, Femen, the Paris-based Ukrainian radical feminist group, have never been ones to shy away from provocative public protest. Back in 2013, two of the group's members chose Paris Fashion Week as the location for their next stunt, making an uninvited runway appearance at Nina Ricci\u2019s SS14 show. That said, this wasn\u2019t the first time the group had set fashion in their sights; they\u2019d previously gatecrashed the taping of Germany\u2019s Next Top Model\u2019s finale (Ms Klum was not amused). Anyway, with their bare bodies daubed with catchy slogans like \u2018Fashion Dictaterror\u2019 and \u2018Model Don\u2019t Go To Brothel\u2019, they ran onto the catwalk, taking Liverpudlian model Hollie-May Saker by the hand in an assumed act of sisterly solidarity. Though Femen may have experience in publicly fighting the patriarchy, they\u2019d yet to face the wrath of a Scouse woman scorned. \u201cI just punched her,\u201d reported Saker, referring to the reflex-triggered stinger she landed on her assailant\u2019s nose. \u201cMy Scouseness came out a bit but I wish it had come out a bit more. Thinking about it now I wish I'd pushed them both off the stage because they ruined my favourite show.\u201d\n\nBr\u00fcno\n\nIt is frankly irresponsible to write a list of fashion\u2019s top gatecrash moments without a nod to everyone\u2019s favourite fashion TV presenter, Br\u00fcno. Counting Iceberg and Stella McCartney among them, the list of shows he\u2019s gatecrashed reads like an industry hit-parade. At one point, such was his notoriety that the Italian Chamber of Fashion urged brands not to admit anyone from his production company to their shows. But it seems that their message must have landed in Agatha Ruiz de la Prada\u2019s spam inbox, because, true to form as ever, fashion\u2019s favourite Euro-twink exploded onto her runway. Garbed in a very derelicte assemblage that wouldn\u2019t look out of place at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Br\u00fcno owned the runway until the lights were dimmed and Austria\u2019s brightest D-lister was rugby tackled to the ground by a bevvy of burly Italian security guards. Ausgezeichnet!\n\nThe SURGE protester at Mary Katrantzou\n\nWhile the lion\u2019s share of blockbuster runway stormings have taken place in Paris and Milan, gatecrashers on this side of the channel are not to be entirely written off. At Mary Katrantzou AW18, one attendee, a member of animal rights group SURGE seemingly possessed by the spirit of a Dickensian town-crier, took to the runway to condemn the conduct of the front row fold. \u201cShame on you, London Fashion Week!\u201d she cried. Though most assumed that the protest had something to do with fashion\u2019s use of fur, delicious irony was to be found in the fact that all of the Katrantzou\u2019s fur trimmings were in fact faux.\n\nThe D&G streaker\n\nPrior to Femen\u2019s topless protest in Paris, and setting the tone for SS14 as the streaker\u2019s season, was perhaps the most memorable naked runway invasion modern fashion history \u2014 no, there aren\u2019t that many, but the Dolce & Gabbana streaker stands out all the same. Allegedly put up to the task by German menswear blog Dandy Diary as part of a marketing ploy, \u2018Miky the Streaker\u2019 took to the stage in his birthday suit just as the brand\u2019s designers were taking their final bow. His motivation remains unclear, though many have drawn parallels between his freeballing sprint and Milan\u2019s other great cultural export, football. Whatever his cause, \u2018Miky\u2019 proved that the emperor\u2019s new clothes will always earn more attention than whatever else is floating down the runway.\n\nThe Dior Cat\n\nCat on a catwalk \u2014 need we say more? That\u2019s right, the most memorable moment of Dior\u2019s Resort 2020 trip to Marrakech was the appearance of a stray moggy on Maria Grazia\u2019s fire-lit spectacle in the El-Badi Palace. Walking against the models\u2019 grain, the kitty prowled with more grace and sass than her human doppelg\u00e4nger Bella Hadid manages to. In a move more catty than when Naomi Campbell got banned by BA for assaulting a police officer, the kitty then sprayed a front-row attendee\u2019s presumably-priceless dress with piss before slinking away into the crowd. It\u2019s a surprise that PETA didn\u2019t show up to protest the appearance of fur on the runway.\n\nDan Mathews at Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9\n\nThey did, however, take it upon themselves to show face at the show of Dior\u2019s ex-creative director Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 back in 2004. No doubt the inspiration for the hot priest in Fleabag, PETA\u2019s Senior Vice President Dan Mathews donned ecclesiastical chic to sneak into the show, claiming to be Ferr\u00e9\u2019s priest, only to then take to the runway with a banner denouncing the house\u2019s use of fur. Given that the show took place in one of the last firmly Catholic bastions of Western Europe, it\u2019s little surprise that he managed to slip in without so much as guestlist check. \u201cI thought, Italy is a Catholic country, I speak fluent Italian \u2013 this is it,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI told the lady with the clipboard I was at the church Mr Ferr\u00e9 attended and he had invited me for good luck.\u201d A very naughty move on the part of a priest, but , padre (daddy?), if we forgive you your sins, will you forgive ours?\n\nLaura Frandsen at RCA\n\nThough graduate shows are typically known for creativity untainted by the industry\u2019s commercial grasp, one of the most memorable moments of 2019\u2019s Royal College of Art show didn\u2019t actually involve any clothes at all. While models sported looks from the collections of her 50 or so classmates, Laura Frandsen and 20 fellow Extinction Rebellion members staged a \u2018die-in\u2019 in the show\u2019s midst. The models, some of whom wore 10-inch tall perspex claw platforms, staggered over their prone bodies. Though we often speak of fashion as something \u2018to die for\u2019, Frandsen asked: is it really?\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "From cats on the catwalk to banner-bearing hot priests, meet some of the chicest gatecrashers around.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d971c0f3ffb36000ade0d7b/lede/1570187572717-Runway_Header.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
