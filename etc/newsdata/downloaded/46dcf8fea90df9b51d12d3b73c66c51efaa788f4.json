Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJapanese media said the duo, known as \u201cA Masso,\u201d made the remark during a Sunday event, the same day that Osaka lifted her first trophy since winning the Australian Open in January, and also said that \u201cshe is too sunburned.\u201d\n\nIn separate messages carried on the website of their management company, Watanabe Entertainment Co Ltd, both women apologized for making \u201cinappropriate, hurtful remarks\u201d but did not refer to Osaka, who is Haitian and Japanese, by name.\n\n\u201cThough we should have thought about it, we made remarks that hurt many people, something we will never do again,\u201d Ai Murakami wrote.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologize for making the specific person feel uncomfortable, as well as for everyone else connected to the event. We also sincerely apologize for causing trouble.\u201d\n\nWatanabe Entertainment, also without naming Osaka, added their own apology for \u201cremarks inconsiderate of diversity in an era where diversity is respected,\u201d saying the duo had been severely warned and steps taken to raise their awareness of the issue.\n\nNeither Watanabe Entertainment nor Naomi Osaka\u2019s management office in Japan was immediately available to comment.\n\nOsaka, who will turn 22 next month, was born in Japan to a Haitian father and Japanese mother but moved to the United States when she was young.\n\nShe has been widely hailed in Japan, which has traditionally seen itself as a racially homogeneous country, although successful mixed-race athletes such as Osaka herself, sprinter Asuka Cambridge and baseball pitcher Yu Darvish are challenging that image.\n\nIn January, Japanese noodle company Nissin had to remove a controversial commercial in which a cartoon character depicting Osaka was shown with pale skin and light brown hair after it prompted an outcry. Nissin said it had not intended to \u201cwhitewash\u201d Osaka and promised to pay more attention to diversity issues.", "description": "A Japanese comedy duo and their management company have apologized after the pair reportedly said during a live event that Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka, who just won the Pan Pacific Open at the weekend, \"needed some bleach.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433658847&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0DU", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
