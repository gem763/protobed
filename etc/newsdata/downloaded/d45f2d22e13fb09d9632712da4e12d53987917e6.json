Varadkar told reporters that after a \u201cvery positive and very promising\u201d meeting it was now possible for both parties to strike a deal by the \u201cend of October.\u201d\n\nTusk today reiterated the positive outcomes of that meeting. \u201cYesterday, when the Irish Taoiseach and the UK PM met, they both saw \u2014 for the first time \u2014 a pathway for a deal,\u201d he said.\n\nTusk added that he told Johnson a week ago that if there had been no workable proposal in sight by today, he would have publicly announced there were \u201cno more chances\u201d of a deal by the deadline.\n\n\u201cPrime minister Johnson promised the EU to come forward with a solution that would work for all. A solution that would not only satisfy the hardcore Brexiteers, but also solve our well known and legitimate objectives: to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure the integrity of the single market,\u201d he said. \u201cA no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU.\u201d\n\nBarnier and Barclay met this morning for around two hours. Barnier will brief EU diplomats on the meeting at lunchtime.", "description": "\u2018The time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used,\u2019 says European Council president.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Cristina Gallardo", "Charlie Cooper", "Rym Momtaz", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "David M.
