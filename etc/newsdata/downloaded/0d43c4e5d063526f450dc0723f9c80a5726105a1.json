Unsurprisingly, the key topic of the conversation was the omnipresent \u2018Russian threat\u2019.\n\nThe duo of pranksters informed Dunleavy of a sinister plan, masterminded by the Kremlin, to reclaim Alaska. They explained that Moscow believes it had only temporary rented Alaska to the US back in 1876, and now \u2013 especially since the state has a maritime border with Russia, while being separated from the rest of the American territory by Canada \u2013 wants its land back.\n\nI\u2019ve heard about that. I\u2019ve been reading up on it and I\u2019m obviously keeping an eye on it, so is our president.\n\nThe pranksters revealed that Moscow had already sent its \u2018agents\u2019 to the 49th US state to bribe the indigenous people in order to organize an \u2018independence referendum\u2019 and \u2018annex\u2019 Alaska under that pretext. Worried by the new details of the vile plan, the governors said that he would \u201ccertainly be talking to folks in DC about this information.\u201d\n\nThe Russians \u201cwill have a fight on their hands\u201d if they lay their claim to Alaska, the governor stated, vowing to defend his state.\n\nAll I can say on behalf of Alaskans \u2013 we are Americans, and we have no desire to become part of Russia.\n\nOn a less \u2018serious\u2019 subject, the prank-callers wondered if it would be possible to organize a trip to Klondike for the Ukrainian leader \u2013 and make sure that he finds a gold nugget there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can talk to some folks that can help arrange that,\u201d Dunleavy promised, fully welcoming the idea of Petro Poroshenko\u2019s visit to Alaska. The conversation apparently took place in early 2019 when Poroshenko was still Ukrainian President, but was only released online this Friday.\n\nAlso on rt.com Pranksters seek US congresswoman\u2019s support amid \u2018Russian hacking\u2019 of elections in fictitious land\n\nThe two tricksters behind the prank, Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, otherwise known as Lexus and Vovan, have made a name for themselves with a series of phone pranks on high-profile officials, previously getting over on French President Emmanuel Macron, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, as well as former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, then UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and hawkish US special envoy to Venezuela Elliott Abrams.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Freeze all Venezuelan assets' \u2013 US regime-change hawk tells pranksters posing as Swiss president\n\nLike this story?
