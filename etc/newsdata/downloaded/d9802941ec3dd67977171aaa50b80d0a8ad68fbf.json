Two of them have come in overtime and a third in a shootout.\n\n\u201cThis is a good league,\u201d New York coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much separating anybody, so you\u2019ve got to weather the storms.\u201d\n\nAfter Blue Jackets goalie Joonas Korpisalo made a stop, New York\u2019s Nick Leddy avoided a diving Pierre-Luc Dubois to get a pass in close to Nelson, who tapped it in the winner.\n\n\u201c(Leddy) stayed with it,\u201d said Nelson, who had an assist earlier in the game. \u201cI was able to get away from their D and the puck came to me.\u201d\n\nBoone Jenner had tied the score for the Blue Jackets late in the second period when he pounced on a puck that fell out of New York goalie Thomas Greiss\u2019 glove after a shot by teammate Dean Kukan. A scoreless third period followed to set up overtime.\n\nMathew Barzal and Michael Dal Colle also had goals for the Islanders, and Greiss had 34 saves.\n\nSeth Jones had a goal and Korpisalo finished with 31 saves as Columbus lost in overtime for the second consecutive night.\n\n\u201cWe played our (butt) off,\u201d Columbus coach John Tortorella said flatly. \u201cI think we\u2019ve played good all year long.\u201d\n\nBarzal started it when he settled down a bouncing puck on his way down the right side, got out in front of Columbus defender Zach Werenski and beat Korpisalo with a tap between the pads. The goal 8:24 into the game was Barzal\u2019s fourth of the season.\n\nJones tied the score for Columbus later in the first with a wrist shot from the top of the left circle, his first goal of the season.\n\nDal Colle got his first on an easy rebound to put the Islanders up 2-1 at the first intermission.\n\nColumbus dropped to 3-3-2, while the Islanders - their Metropolitan Division rivals - improved to 5-3.\n\nJones said he felt the Blue Jackets played well enough to win.\n\n\u201cWe have to start finishing,\u201d he said. \u201cMoral victories, so to speak, with just creating chances and losing tight games isn\u2019t going to cut it, it isn\u2019t going to get you to the playoffs. So we have to start bearing down here on some of these chances, and it will come.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Columbus had no penalties, and New York had just one. \u2026 Kukan was in the lineup after being scratched the previous five games. He replaced injured D Ryan Murray. \u2026 With an assist on Dal Colle\u2019s goal, Nelson has six points in the past five games. \u2026 Barzal has six points in the past four games. \u2026 Jenner\u2019s second-period goal was his 200th NHL point. \u2026 Columbus\u2019 last six games have been decided by one goal.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIslanders: Host Arizona on Thursday.\n\nBlue Jackets: At Toronto on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Islanders won again in overtime, this time when Brock Nelson scored 33 seconds into the extra period.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mitch Stacy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/islanders_blue_jackets_hockey_76349_c0-105-2512-1570_s1200x700.jpg?09f2320239886addda68cc7ada2a48fe7f4d785f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
