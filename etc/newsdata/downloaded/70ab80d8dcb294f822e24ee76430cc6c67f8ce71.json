This is the United States' eighth death linked to severe lung injury and illness tied to e-cigarettes.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said the man had normal lung function before he started to vape in May. He developed mild respiratory symptoms that worsened, and was hospitalized on August 22.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate case of a young man with no prior lung illness who started vaping because of chronic pain issues,\" Dr. Michael Plisco, Mercy Hospital St. Louis critical care pulmonologist and medical director of Mercy's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program said in a media release. \"He started out with shortness of breath and it rapidly progressed and deteriorated, developing into what is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Once the lungs are injured by vaping, we don't know how quickly it worsens and if it depends on other risk factors.\"\n\nVaping-related illnesses have been linked to seven previous deaths -- two in California and one each in Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Oregon. CDC health officials said on Thursday they expect more deaths to be reported.\n\nThere have been 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injuries related to e-cigarettes as of September 17, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. That's 150 more than was reported on September 11.\n\nRead More", "description": "Missouri health officials announced on Thursday the vaping-related death of a man in his mid-40s.
