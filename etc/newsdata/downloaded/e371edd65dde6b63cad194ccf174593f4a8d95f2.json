The one you can\u2019t take your eyes off of, whose every facial muscle can project joy, pain, sadness, humor or anger from miles away, and sometimes all at once?\n\nOh wait - this is a documentary, and this is Maradona himself, one of the most colorful and fascinating personalities in all of sports, with a life story bordering on the mythic. You may know the outlines of the soccer legend\u2019s life, but there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t learn something from \u201cDiego Maradona,\u201d Asif Kapadia\u2019s absorbing and exhaustive new film.\n\nMost documentaries cut frequently to talking heads. Kapadia, who won an Oscar for \u201cAmy,\u201d about Amy Winehouse, doesn\u2019t do that, preferring to keep the viewer firmly planted in the narrative he\u2019s crafted from hundreds of hours of never-seen archival footage. The approach is hugely effective here because we don\u2019t see the older, larger Maradona, now 58, until the very end.\n\nMuch of the footage Kapadia has unearthed here is nothing short of mesmerizing, both for highly dramatic moments like Maradona\u2019s hero welcome in Naples, where he was to spend seven chaotic years, and quiet moments like the athlete simply sitting at a party and saying nothing, looking lost and miserable as the world starts to crumble around him.\n\nBecause the Naples years form the heart of his film, Kapadia spends only a few minutes on Maradona\u2019s beginnings, from his birth in a Buenos Aires shantytown to his rise as a soccer prodigy who began supporting his family from age 15.\n\nBy the time Maradona arrives in Naples in 1984, he\u2019s greeted as a messiah; the southern city is hungry to challenge the traditional soccer powerhouses further north. Some 75,000 adoring fans gather in the city\u2019s stadium to welcome him.\n\nA soccer genius celebrated as much for his brilliant instincts and vision on the pitch as his physical abilities, he turns Napoli into a winning team. He\u2019s rewarded with a stardom that is hard to fathom. At one point, a commentator notes, virtually every Naples home has a photo of Maradona, \u201cmany on top of their bed, next to Jesus.\u201d\n\nAt the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, with Maradona playing for Argentina, the duality of the man is defined in two famous quarterfinal goals against England: the infamous \u201cHand of God\u201d goal (he later confessed to scoring with his hand) and minutes later one of the greatest goals in history, leading the ecstatic announcer to shout: \u201cWhat planet did you come from?\u201d\n\nThere is amazing celebratory footage here, in the locker room and then in Argentina, where he\u2019s hailed as a savior. More glory is to come in Naples, where after a championship victory people celebrate for weeks, and a sign is erected at the cemetery for the corpses: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you missed.\u201d\n\nThings are soon to unravel. Maradona\u2019s cocaine habit worsens, but as long as he is winning, his team bosses don\u2019t seem to care. He is high half the week, then cleanses his system to play on Sunday.\n\nThen comes the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Maradona and Argentina are forced not only to face the Italian team in its home country, but to play the semifinal match in Naples itself, Maradona\u2019s home stadium.\n\nIt\u2019s a prescription for disaster. He naively asks Neapolitans to support Argentina, and headlines interpret him as saying \u201cNaples is Not Italy.\u201d The Naples fans avidly support their own country and are devastated when Argentina wins, on penalty kicks.\n\nArgentina will go on to lose the final, where Italian fans boo during the Argentine anthem, and he curses back. Maradona\u2019s ties to Italy appear broken. He\u2019s no longer a god, but, as one newspaper dubs him, a devil.\n\nIn 1991, Maradona receives a 14-month suspended sentence on cocaine possession charges in a plea-bargain agreement. He also gets a 15-month suspension from soccer after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nWe watch as the once-adored star leaves Naples in ignominy. In a gruff voice, Maradona recalls here for Kapadia how when he arrived, he\u2019d been greeted by cheering throngs. \u201cWhen I left,\u201d he says, \u201cI was all alone.\u201d\n\nYet of all the voices in the film, perhaps it\u2019s Maradona\u2019s sister, Maria, who says it best, and simplest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavy weight,\u201d she says, \u201cto be so famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego Maradona,\u201d an HBO Sports release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America. Running time: 130 minutes. Three stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jocelyn Noveck on Twitter at www.Twitter.com/JocelynNoveckAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Who's that amazingly expressive actor they got to play Diego Maradona?
