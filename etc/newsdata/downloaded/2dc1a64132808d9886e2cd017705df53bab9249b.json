We really wanted to make it through and everyone is disappointed that we couldn\u2019t, but the motivation was still there today but it was from inside, from the heart.\u201d\n\nDespite his frustration Ledesma was, however, delighted with how some of his fringe players grabbed their opportunities, with all seven tries being scored by backs.\n\n\u201cArgentine rugby has a bright future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe youngsters were incredible today. The way we played today was actually similar to how it was in 2015 (when they reached the semi-finals) and we have been working hard to mix things up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve scored several tries from driving mauls in this World Cup, the scrum was pretty consistent here, so I think it\u2019s a case of trying to use the pack to get go-forward and a consistent set-piece and then we have exciting backs who can deliver as we saw today.\n\n\u201cWe were able to score some really good tries in the match and the players played with real joy.\u201d\n\nCaptain Pablo Matera was also frustrated. \u201cWe played three matches but couldn\u2019t really show what we\u2019ve practiced for the full 80 minutes in any of the games,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut everyone gave their all today. We were playing for the shirt but also for the players who are leaving us. It was Juan Manuel Leguizamon\u2019s last game and he\u2019s the man today and we\u2019re very happy to give him a victory in his last game.\u201d\n\nThe flanker\u2019s 87th cap came 14 years after his first and Leguizamon was hoisted shoulder-high by his team mates on an emotional lap of honour.", "description": "Argentina coach Mario Ledesma said his team finally delivered the sort of all-court game they had been working towards for months in their 47-19 win over the United States on Wednesday, but not even the seven-try romp could lift his gloomy tournament outlook.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438766272&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980NC", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
