I was in Hong Kong last week, and people I spoke to there really emphasized that this is a social movement.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by massive protests since June, triggered initially by the Hong Kong legislature entertaining a bill that would have given China the power to extradite anyone present in Hong Kong. Chief Executive Lam recently pledged to scrap the bill, although the demonstrations have now morphed into a wider pushback against China\u2019s increasing control and interference over the supposedly autonomous territory.\n\nIt is not the first time that Melby has taken a stand against China\u2019s communist regime. In May, she was barred from entering the Norwegian parliament wearing a T-shirt featuring the Chinese letters for \u201cfreedom\u201d during a visit to the country by Chinese Politburo Standing Committee member Li Zhanshu.\n\nA bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers last year nominated activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Alex Chow, and the wider pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. They lost out to Congolese gynecologist Dr. Denis Mukwege and former Yazidi Islamic State captive Nadia Murad for their contributions toward combating wartime sexual violence.\n\nDespite widespread speculation that Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg would win the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, the award was given to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali \u201cfor his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "A Norwegian lawmaker nominated the Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators on Tuesday for the 2020 Noble Peace Prize.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/05/d083e3_hong-kong-protests-17981-masked-protesters-walk-banner-reads-hong-kong-e1571256613192-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
