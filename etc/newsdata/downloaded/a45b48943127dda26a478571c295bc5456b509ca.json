Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month the Treasury was \"very seriously considering\" issuing a 50-year Treasury bond next year, as the administration looks to take greater advantage of low interest rates to slow soaring borrowing costs.\n\nThe Treasury also said it is closely monitoring the Fed's recently announced purchases of Treasury bills following strains in money markets last month.\n\n\"The Fed purchases are still in the early stages and at this point we're monitoring how the purchases program will evolve and any effects on the market,\" a Treasury official said Wednesday. \"It would be premature to draw any conclusions at this point.\"\n\nThe Fed began buying short-term Treasury debt earlier this month and said it would continue the purchases -- starting at $60 billion a month -- into the second quarter of 2020. That marked a turnaround for the central bank, which until August had been shrinking its nearly $4 trillion balance sheet. Last month's funding pressures related to shortages of funds that resulted from an increase in federal borrowing and the central bank's decision to shrink the size of its asset portfolio.\n\nA Treasury borrowing advisory committee warned the purchases could lead to scarcity in the T-bill market if the Treasury doesn't change its coupon auction sizes, but it recommended keeping issuance unchanged in the current quarter, according to minutes from its meeting this week.\n\nWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 08:51 ET (12:51 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
