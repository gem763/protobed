Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, are getting even more aggressive. They\u2019re organizing shareholder resolutions to push liberal policies in corporate board rooms, they\u2019re pressuring governments to divest pensions from industries they don\u2019t like and they\u2019re demanding that banks stop financing the industries they hate.\n\nShould they succeed, this unfortunate but effective end-run around the traditional policymaking structure will have dire consequences for our capitalist system. If banks are unwilling to work with the energy, firearms and corrections industries, that would destroy consumer choice, punish lawful companies and outsource our regulatory policy to angry online mobs.\n\nAmericans should fight back against these discriminatory banking policies \u2014 and the financial institutions themselves must resist them.\n\nThe Trump administration has recognized this threat.\n\n\u201cOperation Choke Point,\u201d a government-backed effort to impose banking discrimination, was killed by the Trump administration.\n\nIn 2013, the Obama administration launched \u201cOperation Choke Point,\u201d a secretive program to starve \u201cunsavory\u201d industries of resources by pressuring banks not to lend to them.\n\nThe initiative, led by the Department of Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was created to \u201cchoke off\u2019 the oxygen [money] needed for these industries to survive.\u201d\n\nTargeted industries at the time included gun stores, ammunition shops and short-term lenders.\n\nThe program was problematic for a number of reasons \u2014 most notably that it deprived legal industries of their right to contract with other legal private companies. But a key concern among critics of Operation Choke Point is the arbitrary way in which the federal government wished to designate the industries to \u201cchoke off\u201d from funding.\n\nUnder the guise of \u201cending fraud,\u201d the Obama administration set the stage for using the financial system to discriminate against politically disfavored industries.\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration ended Operation Choke Point.\n\nIn a letter to then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd stated, \u201cWe share your view that law-abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, in Washington, no bad idea ever truly dies. Activists have built upon the Obama administration\u2019s plan by building a pressure campaign to achieve the goals of Operation Choke Point.\n\nReal Money Moves is an activist coalition created to put pressure on banks to stop lending to companies in industries they don\u2019t like.\n\nThe coalition includes Hollywood celebrities, feminist activists and athletes including Amy Schumer, Alyssa Milano, Gloria Steinem and the cast of \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d to put star power behind their anti-capitalist message.\n\nThe campaign targets what the activists call \u201cextractive industries,\u201d including fossil fuels and private corrections.\n\nSpecifically, they have had success pressuring big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, into cutting ties with the private corrections industry.\n\nIn addition to moral problems, banking discrimination is expressly forbidden by the federal government. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency states as official policy as to how its regulators should oversee banks: \u201cThe agencies will not tolerate lending discrimination in any form.\u201d\n\nWhat is the politicization of banking and lending if not discriminating against industries disfavored by the left?\n\nThere are serious consequences to this movement.\n\nThe general principle of allowing banks to discriminate against lawful industries is obviously problematic.\n\nWorse, as we saw under the Obama administration, the list always starts small and mushrooms into something bigger.\n\nOperation Choke Point began as an effort to root out fraudulent activity, but quickly expanded to hit industries under the guise of \u201creputation risk,\u201d attacking everything from gun companies\u2019 access to lending to porn stars\u2019 bank accounts.\n\nWhen we outsource policy to an angry mob of celebrities and Twitter users, where does it end?\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, hit the nail on the head in opposition to this movement, saying, \u201cWe have seen in recent months and years, for example, some big banks trying to use their economic power to defund politically disfavored groups.\u201d\n\nThis speaks to the real root cause of the pro-banking discrimination effort: Punish any industry we don\u2019t like.\n\nAttacks on specific industries have real world impacts on the lives of Americans.\n\nSecond Amendment supporters may see their ability to arm themselves compromised as firearms companies go out of business.\n\nOur southern border, already in chaos, will only get worse if we lose the ability to detain migrants who are in the U.S. illegally because private facilities are forced to shutter.\n\nOil and natural gas pipelines give us secure access to affordable energy. What will happen to gasoline prices if pipeline manufacturers are shut out of the banking system?\n\nBanking discrimination is wrong. These companies are operating legally. Americans must fight this hijacking of the free market in the name of a left-wing policy agenda.\n\nToo many banks have rolled over and complied with activist harassment. The list of targeted industries will only expand as the activists see success.\n\n\u2022 Matt Mackowiak is president of Austin, Texas, and Washington-based Potomac Strategy Group.
