The designer\u2019s inspiration came from iconic imagery and vintage styles. [PARK SANG-MOON]\n\n[SEOUL FASHION WEEK]\n\nAshley Williams is one of London\u2019s most in-demand designers. Known for her bold patterns and love for 1980s and 90s fashion, the 31-year-old has already collaborated with brands like Jimmy Choo, LG Electronics and Coca-Cola.This month, Williams made her way to Korea for her first fashion show outside of London, becoming the second British designer to show at Seoul Fashion Week as part of an ongoing partnership between organizers here and the British Fashion Council (BFC).Williams\u2019 show was held at an underground parking lot venue within the Dongdaemun Design Plaza in central Seoul on Friday. With a Korea-themed video that she created especially for the show playing in the background, the designer showcased some of her motifs like ruffled dresses and giant ribbons. Cartoonish sperm pattern prints, which raised eyebrows after her collection last season, made a reappearance, along with other graphic imagery like Grecian statues and Playboy bunnies.\u201cWe do have a lot of vintage influence, but it evolves and changes,\u201d Williams told the Korea JoongAng Daily ahead of her show on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s high and low fashion with a mixture of good taste and bad taste.\u201dThe following are edited excerpts from an interview with the designer.. The BFC got in contact and asked me if I would be interested in doing a show in Korea. I said yes, I would. I don\u2019t actually know how they select people. They didn\u2019t really give me any information.Everyone here\u2019s been so amazing and helpful. Normally we\u2019ll have sponsors, but I would have to find them myself, and the BFC will facilitate, but there\u2019s no financial support. But here, everything\u2019s been organized - it\u2019s kind of like a sponsorship or a grant, so it\u2019s pretty lucky that I\u2019ve been picked to do it.We worked with a Korean casting director who\u2019s got an agency and saw loads of girls and got to select who we wanted. So even though it had involvement from a lot of people, we haven\u2019t had to hand over [the management]. We were able to work with people in a really nice way.There\u2019s a bunch of [imagery] from classical civilization. We have classical Greek icons like the Acropolis, Venus de Milo and the ancient Egyptian scribe who\u2019s like a hieroglyphic.I\u2019m interested in imagery and what images mean and how they can sum up a lot in just one little impactful graphic. So it was interesting for me to mix classical civilization icons with modern day icons and put them side by side because they don\u2019t go together.The Playboy graphic to me was like the modern day icon in terms of a graphic image. The Venus de Milo being a naked woman is what Playboy represents. I was thinking about instantly recognizable images that stand on their own as icons.I just love it. Something I\u2019ve done the last few seasons is think about how images can be part of our branding, because we would always come up with new ones for the next season, but actually I think it\u2019s good to have crossover. It\u2019s a key part of our branding.Sperm is so natural. It\u2019s part of creation and life. But some people find it quite visually offensive to look at. To me it\u2019s not offensive or weird because it\u2019s how we\u2019re made. Why is a sperm print controversial when it\u2019s part of human nature?When I was working with Jimmy Choo, one thing they said to me was that they liked that you could look at any garment and accessory and you knew that it was from the Ashley Williams brand - we had a really strong aesthetic and that\u2019s why they wanted to work with us.They\u2019re instinctive. They can come out of anywhere, really. Fashion and making clothing for me is my form of communication. I can express myself the most freely. I don\u2019t tend to think too much about it. It\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling at the time.I wear a lot of my own clothing but I dress down a lot. I would say [my brand] is not necessarily an alter ego, but a language. Not an alternative version of myself, but a message from within that I don\u2019t necessarily express day to day.When I was younger, from late childhood to my early teens, I was definitely interested in clothing. I didn\u2019t know too much about the fashion industry or what it meant. But I liked making my own clothes and how it related to what I was really into within my own micro-culture. It showed what I represented and believed in.When I got a bit older, I discovered Jeremy Scott. I got into fashion through him and started buying magazines from then and just got more into it.When I first started I was quite naive and uneducated on the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Even now, I would say I\u2019m not [very] educated, considering the huge impact it has.Fashion on the whole isn\u2019t a sustainable industry and it\u2019s impossible to be, but you can make changes in your business and within how you buy - just be more aware and choose the better option.BY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/21194143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
