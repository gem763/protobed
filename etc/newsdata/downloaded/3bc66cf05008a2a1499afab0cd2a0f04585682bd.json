The packaging for the Western U.S. brand includes the text \u201cA Local Favorite,\u201d and the website touts the benefits, from the way they source water \u201cto the recycled plastic.\u201d But the truth is, it is just one of 51 brands owned by Nestl\u00e9 Waters. In a new feature, The Guardian reveals how the Swiss conglomerate is exploiting America\u2019s freshwater supply and selling it back to citizens in plastic bottles.\n\nWhen you grab one of said plastic bottles, have you ever considered where the water inside comes from? If you knew, you might fill a glass at the tap instead. The Guardian runs through a list of rivers, creeks, wells and other freshwater sources in America where Nestl\u00e9 draws its water, often for cheap, with the help of affiliated regulators and to the detriment of local communities.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s Strawberry Creek in California which sits on federal land. According to The Guardian, Nestl\u00e9 paid \u201cpractically nothing\u201d to access it, drew 45 million gallons for the Arrowhead brand in 2018, and now conservationists are warning the area is drying up as a result. Meanwhile in Maine, Nestl\u00e9 has employed a multifaceted campaign including goodwill-inducing local donations, big-time political donations and Facebook ads to push its water extraction agenda. It\u2019s paying off \u2014 the state supreme court recently ruled in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s favor in a dispute over the company\u2019s deal to take 75 million gallons a year from a well in the town of Fryeburg \u2026 for the next 25 years.\n\nOf course, Nestl\u00e9 paints these efforts in a different light. \u201cIt presents itself as a responsible steward of America\u2019s water and an eco-friendly \u2018healthy hydration\u2019 company aiming to save the world\u2019s freshwater supply,\u201d writes The Guardian. \u201cIt calls itself a job creator that invests heavily in local municipalities and says it bottles a minuscule amount of the nation\u2019s water.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t address the global pollution of single-use plastic, but Nestl\u00e9 itself does admit its current plan to stop its own environmental destruction \u201cis not enough.\u201d The obvious solution, to significantly curtail the $7.8 billion annual sales of its bottled water, is likely not on their list of potential steps.\n\nThe underlying question is summed up by The Guardian this way: \u201c\u2026 should water be commodified and sold by private industry, or is it a basic human right?\u201d\n\nIf private companies like Nestl\u00e9 continue to gain control of freshwater sources, Americans may not get a say in the matter.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The Guardian", "description": "Swiss-based company Nestle Waters owns 51 bottled water brands.
