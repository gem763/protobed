The big caveat for even the best business cards is that this category was excluded from many of the consumer protections enshrined into law by the 2010 CARD Act.\n\nIllustration by Tim Boelaars More\n\nAll the same, having a dedicated business credit card can offers important benefits: It can make accounting and cash flow management easier, and some lenders let you issue cards to your employees for free. In addition, you might be able to secure a higher credit limit than you could with a personal card, and building your business credit will make it easier if you need to tap capital in order to expand or quickly take advantage of a new business opportunity.\n\nDetermining the best business card depends in a large part on what you do and how you spend. For instance, if you plan to pay your balance in full every month, business credit cards with rewards might be more appealing than ones that offer the lowest APRs. Even among the best business credit cards, no-annual-fee offerings can be hard to find, so evaluate business credit cards based on other factors, as well. Also, read the fine print to see if your rewards will be capped; unlimited rewards are becoming more common, and are obviously preferable when it comes to getting the maximum value of your card.\n\nIllustration by Tania Guerra More\n\nKey Terms\n\n\u2022Rewards: 2% cash back\n\n\u2022Annual Fee: $95, first year waived\n\n\u2022APR: 18.74%\n\nWhy You Should Get It\n\nThe Spark Cash is a repeat winner in the best business credit card category, and with good reason: It offers a generous 2% cash back on all spending. While MONEY has observed growth in category-specific accelerated rewards earnings \u2014 say, for office supplies, postage or digital services \u2014 a single, generous rewards rate is likely to please many owners looking for small business credit cards. Another reason this card rises to the top of our database: a signup bonus worth $500 if you spend $4,500 on the card within three months of opening the account. What\u2019s more there are no foreign transaction fees, which is handy if you conduct any overseas business or travel abroad in your line of work.\n\nAnother attribute that lets you maximize the value of your rewards is being able to distribute cards to your employees, which lets you earn the rewards from their spending activity as well as your own. If you\u2019re looking for the best credit card for small business, and you\u2019re not sure what kind of APR you\u2019ll be able to get, the Spark Cash\u2019s single APR \u2014 18.74% \u2014 is higher than some but eliminates any uncertainty or guesswork about how much you\u2019ll have to pay to service your debt.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A business card can make accounting and cash flow management easier, and some lenders let you issue cards to your employees for free.", "authors": ["Martha C.
