Since then the $1B makeup mogul has been linked to Tyga and Scott has been tied to model YungSweetRo.\n\nScary shot: Travis Scott dropped the music video for his single Highest In The Room on Friday morning\n\nFenced in: In the song the 28-year-old Texas native raps about his girlfriend not wanting him to go on tour\n\nThe video opens with the Scott - who shares baby Stormi (aged one) with his ex - smoking near a city skyline as dark, foreboding clouds hover over him.\n\n'I got room in my fume/ She fill my mind up with ideas/ I'm the highest in the room,' Scott sings as he walks into the futuristic-looking city.\n\nThe song seems to be about his issues with Kylie: 'I'm doing a show, I'll be back soon/ That ain't what she wanna hear.'\n\nIn February there were issues with Kylie and Travis as reports surfaced he had stepped out on his baby mama.\n\nOn pause: Kylie split from Travis after two years but will co-parent their daughter Stormi (pictured most recently at the August 27 premiere of Netflix documentary, Travis Scott: Look Mom I Can Fly)\n\nAnd he did cancel a concert in Buffalo in New York to be with the TV star.\n\nThe song was first heard in April when Kylie was promoting her cosmetics line.\n\nAlso in the video, Scott is kidnapped and when he comes to there are people are him in scary neon ski masks. He is also seen with hooks in his mouth that are attached to long black wires.\n\nNext Travis is in a strip club with hot women dancing in neon bikinis and grabbing at his chest.\n\nA woman in a red bikini top and red coat with blonde hair slicked back gives him a tattoo in an elevator.\n\nThen he battles a robot in a building that is under construction.\n\nLater he is back to where the video began.\n\nThe hot chicks want me: Next Travis is in a strip club with hot women dancing in bikinis\n\nNo Kylie in sight: The ladies have on neon green and yellow two pieces\n\nTech has him angry: Then the Houston, Texas native battles a robot\n\nThe look he likes: One of the models has blonde hair and blonde eyebrows\n\nAlso on the track, Scott raps, 'When I'm with you, I feel alive/You say you love me, don't you lie.'\n\n'Don't cut my heart, don't wanna die/Keep the pistol on my side,' he continues.\n\nMeanwhile, Kylie seems to have found solace with an ex. She was seen outside Tyga's recording studio at 2 am this week in exclusive pictures obtained by DailyMail.com.\n\nBut she denied any wrongdoing on Thursday.\n\nTaking to Instagram she told fans: 'The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is. There was no '2am date with Tyga'. You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at.'\n\nThe seeming connection between the two raised eyebrows, coming just the day news broke that Kylie and her baby daddy had secretly broken up weeks ago.\n\nTwitter message: Kylie insists her 2am visit to ex Tyga's recording studio was innocent\u2026 and says she's on 'great' terms with Travis Scott after split\n\nBack on the single scene: She was spotted leaving Delilah's in West Hollywood on Tuesday evening around 2.15am; she then dropped by a studio where her ex Tyga was at work\n\nNew love? Since then the $1B makeup mogul has been linked to Tyga and Scott has been tied to model YungSweetRo\n\nBut Kylie wrote on Thursday: 'Travis and I are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi\u203c\ufe0f our friendship and our daughter is priority.'\n\nTyga has not commented on his links with Kylie. Instead he posted an emoji image of a cap, just half an hour after Kylie's damage control tweets.\n\nThe simple image had no caption. However his message was taken by some to refer to 'cappin it' - a slang term for someone who is lying and attempting to put a cap on it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kylie partied with pals Anastasia 'Stassi' Karanikolaou and Kelsey Calemine at West Hollywood hot spot Delilah from around midnight until shortly after 2am.\n\nKylie looked downcast as she got into her blue Rolls Royce with her pals while leaving the hotspot.\n\nIn an eyebrow-raising twist, they headed straight to the studio where Tyga was at work. Curiously, rather than dropping her pals off at the main entrance, the Rolls Royce was pictured parked up for some time inside the hotel's lot.\n\nDespite her later denials, Kylie's spokesperson at first declined to comment when contacted by DailyMail.com on Wednesday.\n\nDoting mom: Kylie also published selfies with her daughter Stormi, who she shares with ex Travis Scott, on Thursday\n\nHer entourage - Stassi and Kelsey - were spotted getting out of the blue Rolls Royce and later left the hotel via the same exit as Tyga around 3am. (Stassi and Kelsey headed home in a black SUV.)\n\nKylie managed to stay out of sight during the stop at Sunset Marque, with one onlooker claiming she left via a different exit. However she insists she was simply giving her pals a ride, and did not visit Tyga.\n\nKylie is said to be on friendly terms with her ex and they do occasionally run in the same circles. In fact, she came face to face with him at a strip club called the Sapphire Las Vegas Gentlemen's club in late August, according to TMZ.\n\nThey were at the strip club, which offers private rooms and pole dancing, for Sofia Richie's 21st birthday celebrations.\n\nNews of Kylie and Travis' decision to put their relationship broke on Tuesday afternoon. They actually split several weeks ago, after a long period of rows, according to TMZ.\n\nThe lip kit mogul began dating the Sicko Mode performer, 28, at Coachella in 2017 and within weeks she was pregnant with their now 20-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster - who they are said to be amicably co-parenting.\n\nThe last time the couple were pictured together was at the August 27 premiere of the Netflix documentary, Travis Scott: Look Mom I Can Fly, which chronicles the rapper's personal and professional life.\n\nThe romance has reportedly been cooling off ever since, yet the insider indicated the relationship wasn't completely over either.\n\nAnother source told E! News: 'Kylie and Travis aren't officially calling it quits on their relationship, but are taking space apart.\n\nBack to work: On Thursday Kylie was seen modeling adidas clothing and shoes\n\nAccording to the insider, the pair are staying in separate houses but are in regular contact for the sake of their daughter.\n\nThey added: 'Travis has been staying at his house in Beverly Hills and Kylie has been allowing him to see Stormi. She would never take that away from him.'\n\nTravis did not accompany Kylie to Justin and Hailey Bieber's second wedding ceremony in South Carolina on Monday.\n\nThe reality star attended the event with her sister Kendall and mother Kris, as well as friends including Jaden Smith, and showed no sign of heartbreak at the nuptials.\n\nThe source revealed: 'Kylie had a glass of champagne in her hand and was dancing with Stormi on the dance floor at one point. Kris was holding her a lot of the night.'\n\nNow Travis has moved some of his belongings out of her home and into his West Hollywood residence, reports The Blast.\n\nThe split was reportedly a long time coming, and was a result of the couple growing apart.\n\n'They still have some trust issues but their problems have stemmed more from the stress of their lifestyle,' a source told People.\n\n\n\n", "description": "This comes just days after news broke that the singer has split from Kylie Jenner.
