If you're buying, maybe it's a little high.\"\n\n\"It depends on supply and demand, but on Fridays you get good prices.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Record, Johnson did not take the box of fish with him when he left the market. The report added that the prime minister's aides could not confirm what would happen to the box of fish.\n\nDuring the visit, Johnson attempted to reassure fishermen that a no deal Brexit would not lead to delays in the processing of fish caught in British waters, but Berbner was unconvinced.\n\n\"We're not quite sure what it's going to do, but what it is going to do is its going to put a lot of additional costs and procedures in place which would not be as seamless as we would like and what is happening at the moment,\" he said, according to numerous reports.", "description": "\"If you're selling, it's a great price.
