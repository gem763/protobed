That was one of the first times I was like, \"Wow, this is not fair.\"'\n\nTaylor continued that while there's been much improvements, especially with the 'Me Too' movement, when she sees young people go through what she went through, it puts her 'in a real sad place.'\n\n'When I was the youngest, it was hard because I didn't understand why nobody was saying that this was wrong,' she said.\n\nPast boyfriends: Taylor's early dating life in her teens were also covered heavily in the press (pictured L: 2008 with Joe Jonas, R: 2009 with John Mayer)\n\nYoung and unsure: 'When I was the youngest, it was hard because I didn't understand why nobody was saying that this was wrong,' she said (pictured with Conor Kennedy in 2012)\n\n'Thank God we've had Me Too movements and moments where we're looking at ourselves as a society and we're looking at internalized misogyny. We're looking at the way we treat critiquing women's bodies.'\n\nShe continued: 'We have amazing women out there like Jameela Jamil saying, \"I'm not trying to spread body positivity. I'm trying to spread body neutrality where I can sit here and not think about what my body is looking like.\"'\n\nTaylor was thrown into the limelight when she was 16-years-old and released her self-titled first album.\n\nEarly days: Taylor was thrown into the limelight when she was 16-years-old and released her self-titled first album\n\nOver Taylor's 13 years as an A-list star, she's dated the likes of Joe Jonas, John Mayer, Taylor Lautner, Conor Kennedy, Tom Hiddleston, Calvin Harris and Harry Styles.\n\nShe's currently in a long-term relationship with British actor, Joe Alwyn.\n\nTaylor also spoke about the differences between male and female artists in the industry, something which her song The Man on her Lover album focused on.\n\nLondon boy: Taylor was most recently connected to Tom Hiddleston in 2016 before falling in love with current long-term boyfriend, Joe Alwyn\n\n'I don\u2019t think people understand how easy it is to infer that someone who\u2019s a female artist or a female in our industry is somehow doing something wrong by wanting love, wanting money, wanting success,' she posed.\n\n'Women are not allowed to want those things the way that men are allowed to want them.'\n\nIt was announced on Wednesday that Taylor would be receiving the American Music Awards Artist of the Decade award next month.", "description": "Taylor Swift says she was 'slut-shamed' from an early age and people called her songwriting talents as a 'trick' due to her dating life, that was the same for anyone her age out of the spotlight.", "authors": ["Annita Katee For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/19/20392760-0-image-a-56_1572464078872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
