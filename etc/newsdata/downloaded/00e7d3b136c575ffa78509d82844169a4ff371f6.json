Fourteen remained in detention on Saturday.\n\nNepal is home to around 20,000 exiled Tibetans, but under pressure from Beijing the communist government has taken an increasingly hardline stance on their activities.\n\n\u201cThere is heavy police presence, it is an intimidating situation. We\u2019ve been asked to stay in,\u201d one Tibetan told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nNepal\u2019s authorities declined to comment.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Focus on connectivity\u2019 \u2013\n\nAlthough India has traditionally been Nepal\u2019s main ally, China has intensified its presence in the impoverished Himalayan nation, pumping millions of dollars into infrastructure projects ranging from roads to hydropower plants.\n\nIn 2017, Nepal signed up to China\u2019s Belt and Road programme which includes initiatives to build or upgrade highways and airports in the country.\n\n\u201cA trans-Himalayan connectivity network is thus taking shape, which will serve not just our two countries but also the region as a whole,\u201d Xi said in his article.\n\nLandlocked Nepal is seeking closer ties and much-needed energy and infrastructure investment from its giant neighbour.\n\n\u201cThis visit has historic significance for Nepal. Our priority is to create opportunities for Nepal, joining it to China\u2019s development. We are focusing on connectivity between the two countries,\u201d said Nepal\u2019s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali.\n\nAlthough no official announcement has been made, it is expected that the two countries will sign agreements for Chinese investment in highways, tunnels and hydro projects.\n\nHigh on the agenda is the extension of China\u2019s Kerung railway from the border to Nepal\u2019s capital Kathmandu. There have been warnings over the financial commitments however.\n\n\u201cNepal has to be conscious when it reaches the point of financial dealings on these projects and build capacity to negotiate and not fall into debt traps,\u201d said Sudheer Sharma, editor of the Kantipur national daily.\n\nXi will hold talks with Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and other top leaders and meet with President Bidhya Devi Bhandari.", "description": "Kathmandu (AFP) \u2013 Nepal rolled out the red carpet on Saturday for China\u2019s President Xi Jinping as authorities rounded up Tibetans to prevent", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/d53f79_xi-visit-nepal-is-expected-see-agreements-signed-on-chinese-investment-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
