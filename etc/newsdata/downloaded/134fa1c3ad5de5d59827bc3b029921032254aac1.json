And we ask that you would give him strength to endure and the wisdom lead, and to recognize you as the sovereigns of the universe with the solution to everything. And the people around the president \u2014 the vice president, the cabinet, the advisors \u2014 give us all an understanding heart and a compassionate heart. Those are the things that will keep America great. And help us all to recognize as a nation that separation of church and state means that the church does not dominate the state, and it means the state does not dominate the church. It doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot work together to promote godly principles of loving your fellow man, of caring about your neighbor, of developing your God-given talents to the utmost so that you become valuable to the people around you, and having values and principles that govern your life.\n\n\u201cAnd if we do those things, then we will always be successful,\u201d Carson prayed. \u201cAnd we thank you for hearing our prayer, in your Holy name. Amen.\u201d", "description": "President Trump asked HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson to offer \u201cgrace\u201d at the opening of the cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-501472788-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
