The idea is generally popular in Israel, where the United States is the most important ally and defense partner.\n\n\u201cI had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance . . . between our two countries,\u201d Trump wrote in a pair of tweets Saturday.\n\nThe language of the tweets suggests he is contemplating a formal treaty, which would have to be submitted to the Senate for ratification.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement appeared to be an attempt to bolster Netanyahu ahead of the vote Tuesday, but it fell short of the kind of grand gesture Trump had offered ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s first major election contest this year, when Trump said the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\n\n\u201cPolitically speaking, this is a pretty weak gesture,\u201d said Natan Sachs, director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy. \u201cCompared to recognizing the Golan Heights, this is pretty paltry.\u201d\n\nTrump declined to publicly endorse Netanyahu\u2019s promise last week to annex parts of the West Bank if he is reelected, telling reporters he had nothing to say on the matter. The president also said he strongly doubts a report last week of Israeli spying on the White House.\n\nTrump said he looks forward to continuing the discussion about a defense pact \u201cwhen we meet at the United Nations\u201d this month.\n\nIt is not clear whether Netanyahu will attend this year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, which falls the week after the vote. If he wins, he is expected to attend and use the session to argue against international negotiation with Iran, something Trump has said he wants to do.\n\nA mutual defense pact would tighten the U.S.-Israeli military alliance against Iran, which Israel considers its greatest enemy. It could formally obligate the United States to come to Israel\u2019s defense in the event of an attack, adding an insurance policy to the alliance that would outlast Trump\u2019s tenure unless it was revoked. Such an agreement would also give Netanyahu a positive development to point to amid a disagreement with Trump over the value of new negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.\n\nBut the idea of a pact is not universally popular. Benny Gantz, a former chief of the Israel Defense Forces and Netanyahu\u2019s chief electoral rival, warned in a televised address Saturday that a formal security pact might \u201ctie Israel\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu thanked Trump for Saturday\u2019s announcement, saying in a tweet that Israel \u201chas never had a greater friend in the White House.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Netanyahu said the formal security pact \u201cwill be a historical deal,\u201d and he took credit for Trump\u2019s interest in a military treaty.\n\n\u201cIt is another historic agreement, and I have worked for decades to bring such agreements,\u201d Netanyahu said. A treaty, which he compared to the NATO alliance, \u201cwill bring greater security for the state of Israel.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister, who has built his second campaign of the year on his friendship with Trump and his commitment to Israeli security, had reportedly been exploring a formal U.S. security agreement for months. Political observers in Jerusalem had speculated that an announcement might come the weekend before the election, when political bombshells are practically a campaign tradition.\n\nPolling in Israel suggests a close race in what amounts to a do-over of the election five months ago in which Netanyahu declared himself the winner but was unable to assemble a coalition government.\n\nHendrix reported from Jerusalem.
