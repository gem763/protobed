Stewart's new book Deep State: Trump, the FBI, and the Rule of Law is out today\n\nAnd Deep State says that the new emails that were found on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the husband of Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, by a lowly but determined FBI case officer.\n\nNobody at the FBI was taking action so he went outside the chain of command to New York prosecutors, starting a chain of events that led to Comey reopening the investigation days before the 2016 election.\n\nThe relationship between Page and Strzok has become a lightning rod for Trump and his allies who see it as evidence of bias in the investigation into Russian interference.\n\nStrzok worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but his texts to Page appeared to show a bias, such as discussing an 'insurance policy' if Trump won the 2016 election.\n\nStrzok also called Trump an 'idiot' and after he won wrote to Page: 'OMG I am so depressed'.\n\nAccording to Stewart before the texts and relationship became public knowledge, Bill Priestap, head of counterintelligence in the FBI, told McCabe about the rumors of Page and Strzok's affair.\n\nHe was supposedly worried Page was 'monopolizing' Strzok's time and had already given some of his duties to another FBI agent in case his suspicions were right.\n\nStewart also reveals that former FBI director James Comey had deep concerns about the impartiality of former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. When it came to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, Comey considered asking for her to appoint a Special Counsel because he was so alarmed - but she rebuffed him\n\nTHE SHOCKING TEXTS BETWEEN THE FBI OFFICIALS March 2016: Page, sent a text to Strzok saying: 'God, Trump is a loathsome human... omg he's an idiot.' 'He's awful,' Strzok replied. 'Yet he may win' (the Republican nomination), he said, adding that could be 'Good for Hillary.' Strzok later added that Hillary 'should win 100,000,000-0.' March 2016: Page texted Strzok: 'I can not believe Donald Trump is likely to be an actual, serious candidate for president.' The same month, Page texted asking if Strzok had heard Trump: 'Make a comment about the size of his d*ck earlier? This man can not be president.' July 2016: Strzok texted: 'HE [Trump] appears to have no ability to experience reverence which I [SIC] the foundation for any capacity to admire or serve anything bigger than self to want to learn about anything beyond self, to want to know and deeply honor the people around you.'\n\nStewart writes that McCabe told Page that Priestap had brought up the issue.\n\nHe said: 'I know you and Pete are friends, but you have to be more careful. People are talking, and this isn't good for you'.\n\nStewart writes: 'Page was acutely embarrassed, mortified that the issue had even come up, especially because the affair was now over. They were still friends, and still texting...she denied the two were romantically involved or had had an affair'.\n\nNot only that but Page went to Priestap and asked him to give Strzok back his responsibilities and denied to him the affair was true as well, Stewart claims.\n\nThe revelations in 'Deep State' about Lynch relate to her meeting Bill Clinton on the tarmac at Phoenix airport in June 2016 when their two planes happened to be there at the same time.\n\nThe timing was seized on by Republicans because it was in the middle of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nAccording to Stewart, Comey felt the same and was 'nagged in his distrust of Lynch's impartiality by a report, provided by a highly placed informant'.\n\nStewart writes that the informant told Comey of an email from Deborah Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, to Leonard Benardo, an executive with the Open Society Foundations, which was founded by George Soros.\n\nIn it, Wasserman Schultz allegedly assured Benardo that Lynch wouldn't let the Clinton investigation get very far, suggesting that Lynch would protect Clinton.\n\nThe report did not include the actual text but the summary was enough for Comey to 'continue to worry about Lynch's impartiality', Stewart writes.\n\nDeep State says that the Hillary Clinton emails that were found on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the husband of Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, were discovered by a lowly but determined FBI case officer. The discovery of new emails on Weiner's computer was sparked by an exclusive report by DailyMail.com, which revealed he had been sexting a 15-year-old girl\n\nThe discovery of new emails on Weiner's computer was sparked by an exclusive report by DailyMail.com, which revealed he had been sexting a 15-year-old girl.\n\nWhen the FBI seized his belongings this included his laptop, but a lone and unnamed FBI agent was tasked with going through it.\n\nStewart has apparently talked to the agent who said he was 'a little scared' by what he found.\n\nThe agent claimed he was 'not political' but felt that 'something was going to come crashing down' when he found the emails.\n\nThe agent said: 'I didn't work the Hillary Clinton matter. My understanding at the time was I am telling you people I have private Hillary Clinton emails, number one, and BlackBerry messages, number two. I'm telling you that we have potentially ten times the volume that Director Comey said we had on the record. Why isn't anybody here?'\n\nFeeling he 'had nowhere else to turn' on October 19, 2016, the agent met with two prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and hoped they would 'kick some of these lazy FBI folks in the butt and get them moving'.\n\nThey did just that and Comey reopened his investigation into Clinton weeks before the election - and closed it again days later.\n\nAmong the other revelations in 'Deep State' is that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had the support of two cabinet colleagues for invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Stewart claims that it was former chief of staff John Kelly and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions who said they might back it.

I could record the President'.\n\nMcCabe was stunned and when he got back to his colleagues he told them: 'You're not going to believe this'.\n\nOne of them looked like he was going to have a heart attack and said: 'That's a bridge too far. We're not there yet'.\n\nJames B.
