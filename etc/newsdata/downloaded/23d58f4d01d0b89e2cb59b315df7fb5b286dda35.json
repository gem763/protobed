(I\u2019ve trimmed and paraphrased it a bit.)\n\nThe bearded Twerski goes to the airport in his Hasidic garb \u2014 the hat, the long coat, the buttoned white shirt. Another Jew, this one modernly dressed, is annoyed by Twerski and unloads on him: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Must you insist on parading around in that medieval get-up as if it were Purim? Don\u2019t you realize how ridiculous you look? You bring nothing but scorn and embarrassment upon us Jews!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter letting the angry man continue for a while, Twerski says, \u201cI fail to understand what thee art saying. You do realize that I\u2019m Amish, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe modern Jew\u2019s anger quickly turns to embarrassment. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon,\u201d he says apologetically. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you were Amish. You look so much like those Hasidic fellows. You should know that I have nothing but respect for you and your people \u2014 keeping to your ways without bowing to society\u2019s wills and whims.\u201d\n\nThe kicker comes when Twerski says, \u201cAha! If I were Amish, you would have nothing but respect for me. But since I am a Jew, you are ashamed of me. Hopefully one day you will have the same respect for yourself that you have for others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that\u2019s not the moral of the story I have in mind.\n\nThe Washington Post ran a profile of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, and lots of people are outraged or repulsed that two Evangelical Christians do things that are fairly normal for Evangelical Christians to do. Specifically, Mike Pence apparently doesn\u2019t dine alone with women or attend events where alcohol is served if his wife doesn\u2019t accompany him. Perhaps this practice started when he was in Congress, a place where many a politician has ruined his marriage and career by not following such rules.\n\nIn response, there\u2019s been a lot of cheap mockery from prominent liberal writers and activists. It\u2019s an affront to working women! He\u2019s a Christian weirdo! He thinks a meal with any woman will lead to sex!\n\nA lot of conservatives have leapt to the Pences\u2019 defense \u2014 and rightly so. Mollie Hemingway of the Federalist concentrated on how these rules help prevent infidelity: \u201cGood on Mike Pence for acknowledging these truths and knowing his limits.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI agree. But it\u2019s worth pointing out that infidelity needn\u2019t be the issue. I doubt Pence would be a lothario save for those rules. Perhaps he followed them simply to reassure his wife?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe this is none of our business? That would certainly be the attitude of many liberals if Pence were a Democrat and had actually cheated on his wife.\n\nLast summer, when Bill Clinton spoke about his wife at the Democratic convention (\u201cIn the spring of 1971, I met a girl . . . \u201d), liberals gushed at the \u201clove story,\u201d and the rule of the day was that marriage is complicated and the Clintons\u2019 ability to stay married (though practically separated) was admirable. Besides, \u201cWho are we to judge?\u201d \u2014 no doubt Bill Clinton\u2019s favorite maxim.\n\nIt\u2019s a very strange place we\u2019ve found ourselves in when elites say we have no right to judge adultery, but we have every right to judge couples who take steps to avoid it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut ultimately, I don\u2019t think the important double standard is about marriage or adultery. It\u2019s about traditional Christians.\n\nIf the Pences were Muslims and followed similar rules, as devout Muslims indeed might, I doubt there\u2019d be anything like this kind of liberal scorn.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s unknowable. But liberals spend a lot of time and energy defending accommodations for religious Muslims \u2014 burqas, veils, gender segregation, etc. \u2014 that they would never make for committed Christians.\n\nPart of it is coalitional. For instance, the feminist march on Washington \u2014 the one with all those women wearing female-genitalia hats \u2014 was co-chaired by Linda Sarsour, a committed Muslim who at times defends sharia law (including the Saudi ban on female drivers, for instance).\n\nBut part of it strikes me as a crude form of partisan bigotry born of a kind of self-loathing of America\u2019s traditional culture. Orthodox Muslim views on women are exotically \u201cother\u201d and somehow courageous, like the imagined Amish traveler. Orthodox Christians are embarrassing, like the Hasidic one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National Review.
