It has nothing to do with equality. Love the submissive role the Lord has given you, women. Trust that God\u2019s ways are perfect!' she said.\n\nShe continued her theme on domestic abuse on Tuesday, trying to clarify that she believes women shouldn't be abused in their marriages.\n\n'Wifely submission does NOT cause abuse as many want to argue. Submission is God's perfect will for wives. A man who is abusive will abuse whether or not she's submissive. If she's being abused, she needs to seek protection, but then not tell others that submission causes abuse,' she tweeted.\n\nShe continued her theme on domestic abuse on Tuesday, trying to clarify that she believes women shouldn't be abused in their marriages\n\nShe then warned that many people claim they're abused when they're 'not getting their way'\n\n'Some women have a tendency to label anyone that doesn't treat them the way they want to be treated as \"abusive.\" This isn't abuse, women! It's simply not getting your way. Don't minimize those who are truly being abused due to you wanting your own way,' she added.\n\nHer comments however sparked to outrage online, with one upset Twitter user saying: '\"Wifely submission\" isn\u2019t the cause of abuse; it\u2019s a symptom of manipulation, which is a form of abuse.'\n\n'No one's actions (no matter how quarrelsome or contentious) deserve abuse. Also, kind, loving women get abused quite often. Abusers don't care. They abuse because they're abusers. Not because of someone's actions,' another Twitter user hit back.\n\nThe backlash: Furious Twitter users fired back at her for her incendiary comments. This Twitter shared a meme saying 'Jesus left the conversation'\n\n'Shocking and dangerous theology. Standing with others who have already said - abusers are always to blame, it is never the case that a wife has not been submissive enough,' one Twitter user fired back.\n\n'Yeah that\u2019s what pastors told my sweet, submissive mother who hasn\u2019t stopped being abused. If you knew even the slightest thing about the basic human psyche it\u2019s that predatory men always look for submissive women. Go talk to survivors,' one furious Twitter user clapped back.\n\n'How dare you I was a battered wife so this is anathema to me ! You haven't a clue about domestic abuse or how it occurs that's patently obvious !!!' another added.\n\n'A sign of abuse is constantly sticking up for one's abuser. Think about that real hard,' one Twitter user argued.\n\nOne person shared a meme showing the image of Jesus with the caption 'Jesus left the conversation.'\n\nAlexander landed in hot water in January for suggesting female rape victims shouldn't have abortions because 'two wrongs don't make a right'.", "description": "Controversial evangelical Christian blogger\u00a0Lori Alexander, 60, sparked controversy on Twitter on Monday for her remarks on domestic abuse where she said 'quarrelsome' women get abused.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/04/20065158-0-image-a-39_1571802697328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
