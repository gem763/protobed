What does that mean about bullying?\" Gates said in the interview, which took place at the Economic Club of Washington, DC in June. \"So, yes, the government needs to get involved.\"\n\nGates expects that one area where we're likely to see additional government regulation of tech companies is around the issue of data privacy. Facebook, Google and other tech companies (Microsoft included) have been rocked by a series of privacy scandals in recent years that affected millions of users' personal information.\n\n\"There will be more regulation of the tech sector, things like privacy \u2026 there should be, at some point, federal regulation that relates to that,\" Gates said.\n\nMeanwhile, the fact that more and more people today get their information online, including from social media platforms, has sparked concerns from regulators over whether or not tech companies are taking enough precautions to stop the spread of misinformation on their platforms. Count Gates among those who believe that government regulations could help ensure that the information being widely disseminated on many of those online platforms can be trusted.\n\n\"The fact that, now, this is the way people consume media has really brought it into a realm where we need to shape it so that the benefits need to outweigh the negatives,\" he said in the interview.", "description": "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes the broad influence of tech companies on our daily lives makes stricter government oversight essential.", "authors": ["Tom Huddleston Jr."], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105894486-15571466884721u8a0048r.jpg?v=1571331117", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
