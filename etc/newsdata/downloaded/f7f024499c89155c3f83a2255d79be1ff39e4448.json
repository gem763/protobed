We wanted to play the game at our pace, not theirs, and we did that in the second half.\u201d\n\nFears England could come into the match undercooked, after their final pool game against France was washed out by last week\u2019s devastating typhoon, ultimately proved unfounded.\n\nMay\u2019s early salvo and Farrell\u2019s perfect eight-from-eight kicking meant England exorcised the demons of their traumatic early World Cup exit four years ago \u2014 one of the lowest points in English rugby history.\n\nIt also extended England\u2019s winning run over Australia to seven matches dating back to that tournament when they condemned the hosts to a first-round exit with a 33-13 drubbing at Twickenham.\n\nEngland have now beaten Australia at the quarter-final stage on all three occasions the Wallabies have failed to reach the last four, after 1995 and 2007.\n\nAfter an early Christian Lealiifano penalty, a slow-burner burst into life with May scoring twice in three minutes to put England in the driving seat.\n\nHenry Slade, making his return from a knee injury, had threatened before England broke through on 18 minutes.\n\nAfter securing good lineout ball, Farrell deftly switched play to the left and after a couple more phases, Tom Curry\u2019s quick hands fed May to dive over in the corner.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Bring it on\u2019 \u2013\n\nMoments later, England\u2019s prolific winger was again the beneficiary following more fine work from Slade, who picked off a David Pocock pass and sent a clever grubber kick into the same corner for May to finish clinically.\n\nAfter a close-range Farrell penalty had extended England\u2019s advantage, Lealiifano nailed his third three-pointer of the half to reduce the lead at the break to 17-9.\n\nThe masters of knockout rugby, Australia came out firing at the start of the second half with an explosive burst from winger Marika Koroibete putting the Wallabies right back in it.\n\nBack came England, though, with a brilliant pass from Farrell teeing up prop Kyle Sinckler to bulldoze over for his first Test try, triggering a run of 23 unanswered points.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those \u2018bring it on\u2019 moments,\u201d said England coach Eddie Jones of his side\u2019s second-half dominance.\n\n\u201cWe had to decide whether we were going to stick at it or go individual and I thought it was brilliant.\u201d\n\nFarrell stretched England\u2019s lead back to 11 with another penalty before Sinckler came up with a huge steal to arrest fierce Australia pressure.\n\nTwo more Farrell three-pointers effectively extinguished any hopes of a late Australia fightback before Anthony Watson\u2019s late intercept try confirmed the exit of the two-time champions.\n\n\u201cThe better team won \u2014 that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d said Australia coach Michael Cheika.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to suck that up sometimes. The lads put everything into it today. I want all the Aussies at home and here to know that \u2014 they put their bodies on the line.\u201d\n\nAfter the final gong, England\u2019s players went on a lap of honour to the sound of \u201cLondon Calling\u201d looking ahead to to a date in Yokohama next weekend.", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Wing Jonny May produced a quickfire double and captain Owen Farrell was perfect with the boot as England stormed into the World", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/368580_england-wing-jonny-may-scored-two-in-may-day-as-england-crush-aussies-40-16-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
