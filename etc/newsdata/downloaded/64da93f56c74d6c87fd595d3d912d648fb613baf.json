Then Cathedrals began installing helter skelters and golf courses to entice people through their doors.\n\nNow the word of God is being spread with the help of video games.\n\nThis Sunday Exeter Cathedral will play host to a technology-enriched service which will see congregants play an underwater game which should lead them into \u201ccontemplating the depths of Jonah\u201d.\n\nThe ancient cathedral, which opened in 1400, is hosting the traditional Sunday service - but with a twist - in order to fuse technology and spirituality. This \u201cvirtual journey\u201d will be run by Andy Robertson, a former theology student who now works as a video game journalist.\n\nThe service will see congregants playing the aquatic adventure game, \u2018Abz\u00fb\u2019 - billed as \u201can epic descent into the depths of the sea\u201d. The game will be projected on a large screen in real time while attendants pass around the controller and gave a go at navigating the onscreen diver through virtual oceans.", "description": "First, bats were mooted as a tool for mission.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social", "Religious Affairs Editor", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212726039-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
