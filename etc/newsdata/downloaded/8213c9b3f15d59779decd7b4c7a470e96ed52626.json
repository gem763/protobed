Bush backlash", "language": "en", "text": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres is promoting kindness following backlash to her outing with former president George W. Bush.\n\nThe 61-year-old television personality spoke out on her show Tuesday after attending a Dallas Cowboys football game with Bush on Sunday.\n\nDeGeneres explained how Charlotte Jones, the daughter of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, invited her and her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, to the game. She was seated next to Bush and his wife, former first lady Laura Bush, in the Joneses\u2019 private suite.\n\n\u201cDuring the game, they showed a shot of George and me laughing together,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cPeople were upset. They thought, \u2018Why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2019\u201d\n\nDeGeneres faced heavy backlash online, but shared one tweet that read, \u201cEllen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u201d She urged people to be kind to \u201ceveryone,\u201d in spite of differences.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cWe\u2019re all different, and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres also shared her response on Twitter.\n\n\u201cYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBush appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show for the first time in March 2017.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres is promoting kindness following backlash to her outing with former president George W.
