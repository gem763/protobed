The bank will publish a report after the pilot is completed. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The move comes one week after The Logic reported the bank is exploring launching a digital currency to collect more data on transactions than is possible with cash.

It\u2019s also the bank\u2019s latest move to prepare for a digital coin following the first-ever transfer of a digital currency from one central bank to another, which it conducted with Singapore in May. For MindBridge, this is the latest sign of the federal government\u2019s favour. In June, the company raised $14.5 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund.
