Many of the Republicans who have come out in opposition to the pullback believe that the removal of troops in northern Syria will embolden Tehran to escalate tensions in the region.\n\nEither way, Paul looks like he'll be sitting alone at this particular lunch table for now, as the Republican opposition continues to pile up.\n\n\n\n\n\nI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 7, 2019", "description": "Sen.
