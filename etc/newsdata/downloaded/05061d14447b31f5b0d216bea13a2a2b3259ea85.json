I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\u201d\n\nConservative media in the US have gleefully covered the story, which began with the publication of a nude photo on the far-right web site RedState. The photos appear to have been leaked as part of an acrimonious divorce proceeding that is ongoing for Hill.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s 25th congressional district had been held by Republicans for more than 20 years before Hill won the seat as part of the blue wave of 2018.\n\n\u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me. I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain,\u201d she said in a separate statement.\n\n\u201cThis coordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian has reached out to the Mail for comment.", "description": "Democrat sent cease-and-desist as lawsuit suggests publication defamed her by claiming she has a Nazi-inspired tattoo", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5da81044260d8136b337ce1492f727e8ec9d7df/0_55_4109_2465/master/4109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a0363cc6ded0cff2b0ca96e986e67c9", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
