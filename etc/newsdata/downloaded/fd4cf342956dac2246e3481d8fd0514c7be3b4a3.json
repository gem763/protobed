For an average retiree who gets a monthly check of $1,460, that adds up to an additional $23.40 a month, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to be dipping into savings,\u201d says Mary Johnson, a policy consultant for the Senior Citizens League, arguing that the measure of inflation used to calculate benefits doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the spending patterns of seniors. \u201cAnd when they don\u2019t have the savings, they might have to borrow the money.\u201d\n\nAbout half of seniors rely on Social Security for at least half their income, and about a quarter depend on it for at least 90% of their income, AARP says.\n\nAre you ready for this tax deadline? Did you ask for a federal tax extension in April? Your time is almost up.\n\nHere's how to ace money for college: You can apply for FAFSA aid money now\n\nThis year, recipients \u2013 which include retirees, the disabled and young survivors of deceased retirees \u2013 received a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), or an average $40.90 extra each month, the most since 2012. But inflation has moderated over the past year, tempering the rise in Social Security benefits.\n\nOver the past decade, COLAs have averaged 1.4%, less than half the 3% average the previous decade, according to the Senior Citizens League. Since low COLAs have a cumulative effect over time, Social Security benefits are about 17.5% lower today than if inflation had averaged a more typical 3% over the same period, Johnson says.\n\n\u201cThe Social Security recipients tell us their standard of living has declined,\u201d Johnson says, noting big-ticket costs for retirees, such as health care and homeowners insurance, have risen sharply.\n\nSocial Security checks More\n\nIn fact, premiums for Medicare Part B, which are automatically deducted from many Social Security checks, are forecast to rise $8.80 month, erasing a chunk of the $23.40 cost-of-living increase. As a result, recipients with monthly benefits of about $550 will see their entire cost-of-living increase wiped out. However, under a \u201chold harmless\u201d provision, Medicare premium increases generally are adjusted so they don\u2019t reduce Social Security benefits.\n\nSomebody may be watching you: Don't look now, but your boss is probably spying on your work phone or computer\n\nJohnson and other retiree advocates have criticized the index that SSA uses to calculate benefits. That measure, the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, has largely reflected price increases for gasoline, electronics and other products that make up a large portion younger workers\u2019 spending.\n\nInstead, they have called for SSA to base the COLA on a proposed index for the elderly, called CPI-E, that would put more weight on items such as health care costs, which have increased more sharply than inflation overall.\n\nSome others, however, favor using an inflation index known as \u201cchained CPI\u201d that would have resulted in a slightly lower increase for Social Security recipients. That strategy would help preserve the Social Security trust fund, which is on pace to run out of money by 2035. Chained CPI accounts for the fact that many Americans alter their spending habits when prices increase, for example, by substituting a less expensive product for a pricey one.\n\n\u201cI think the (1.6%) increase is overstating inflation, not understating it,\u201d says Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nCracking down on gun sales: Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods sawed $5M worth of guns into scrap.
