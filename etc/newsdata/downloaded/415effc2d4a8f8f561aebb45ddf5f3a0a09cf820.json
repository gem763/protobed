The boat somehow slipped undetected through South Korean military and maritime police surveillance.\n\nA government source said Sunday the boat was discovered at around 7 a.m. on Saturday off Samcheok, Gangwon Province, and the fisherman alerted authorities.\n\nA team of investigators are questioning the North Koreans on board and examining the boat.\n\nAlarm bells are ringing because the boat was able to drift 130 km into South Korean waters before anyone noticed. The Navy has primary responsibility for guarding the NLL, the de facto maritime border, and maritime police is in charge of monitoring South Korean fishing boats this side and keeping them from drifting north.\n\nIn theory they can spot even small boats with their marine Automatic Identification System (AIS), while the Army's radars monitor maritime traffic in South Korean coastal waters. But none of them picked it up.", "description": "N.Korean Boat Drifts Undetected Across Maritime Border", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/06/17/2019061701489_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-17"}
