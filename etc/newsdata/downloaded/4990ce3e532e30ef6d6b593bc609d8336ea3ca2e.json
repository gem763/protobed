This led to heightened demand for alternatives, which then became scarce too.\n\nRecent weeks have seen the shortfall become markedly worse, with around half of the most commonly prescribed HRT products now out of stock, and little improvement forecast until the middle of next year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Getty\n\nThe psychotherapist, who supports women through the menopause and provides menopause training for businesses and organisations, said physical symptoms include heart palpitations, hot flushes, night sweats, urinary infections, extreme fatigue, vaginal soreness and dryness, bladder weakness, and insomnia.\n\nSpeaking about the treatment shortage, she told The Independent: \u201cIt is already chaotic. We are seeing more and more women who can\u2019t access their brand of HRT \u2013 they are being given a different prescription but then told that is out of stock.\u201d\n\nThe campaigner, who spearheaded the Make Menopause Matter campaign with the support of cross-party MPs in Westminster last year, added: \u201cI do not think you can overestimate the effects of the HRT shortage. One in four women will experience debilitating symptoms that can last up to 15 years from menopause. If they stop taking their HRT, their symptoms are going to come back.\u201d\n\nMs Danzebrink said: \u201cI am very concerned about the women I interact with because their anxiety is through the roof. They use words like \u2018dread\u2019 and \u2018fear\u2019. Women are genuinely fearful. Women are worried about carrying on with jobs and looking after their children. Not having HRT is going to be life-changing and not in a good way. The shortage places some women at risk of becoming potentially suicidal. The biggest risk of suicide for women is between the ages of 50 and 54. The average age of menopause is 51. That is not a coincidence. My menopause made me suicidal \u2013 I got very close to putting my car in front of a lorry.\u201d\n\nMs Danzebrink said women in the support group described HRT as their \u201clifeline\u201d and one even said their blood pressure keeps rising due to the shortage. HRT replaces the oestrogen that the body stops producing during menopause. There are around 2.5 million prescriptions of HRT made in England every year.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I am only just feeling better \u2013 having been depressed and anxious for nearly three years and having been treated for depression. I don\u2019t want to feel like that again. My pharmacy doesn\u2019t have my patches, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cI\u2019m stockpiling as I\u2019m terrified of running out. I can\u2019t function without my patch, I cannot stand up and teach looking like I\u2019ve been thrown in the sea, in addition to the exhaustion from not sleeping and anxiety that would put me in a compromised position. It\u2019s outrageous that the pharmas cannot get their supply chain organised, it\u2019s not rocket science. And no pre-warnings at all, I only found out when I went to pick up my prescription.\u201d\n\nAnd another woman spoken to by The Independent said she was \u201cworried sick\u201d about the HRT shortage \u2013 explaining she had even resorted to trying to buy HRT online from Europe at heavily inflated prices but it was still not available. She said the thought of \u201cgoing back\u201d to where she was a year ago \u201cterrifies\u201d her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really anxious and stressed,\u201d she added. \u201cI know how my symptoms will return and how even a small difference in dose affects me. I asked for my prescription early but after four weeks I can\u2019t get the complete amount. It is terrifying.\u201d\n\nDr Asha Kasliwal, a gynaecologist who is the president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said it was very hard to know when the HRT shortage would end as there was a lack of information.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe shortage is getting worse. It is affecting my patients quite a bit \u2013 especially the ones who are quite well-settled on HRT. It is time-consuming and frustrating for women and even for the doctors and pharmacists. If they are suffering from debilitating symptoms of menopause then it affects their home life and work life. It can lead to relationship problems. The shortage puts women\u2019s health and wellbeing at risk.\u201d\n\nHaitham Hamoda, chair of the British Menopause Society, added: \u201cWe are concerned that if women are unable to obtain supplies of their HRT, this may result in symptom recurrence and this could adversely impact the quality of women\u2019s lives. It remains unclear why there is a shortage of the treatments in the first place or when the normal supply of the products might resume. We are seeking further information and clarification as to when the matter will be resolved from the industry.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe know how distressing this shortage is for patients and it is our priority to ensure they can access the medicines they need.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of ongoing supply issues with some HRT preparations due to manufacturing issues and are working closely with all suppliers to maintain overall flow of medicines to patients. Supplies of alternative HRT products are available and any patient affected should discuss alternatives with their doctor.\u201d", "description": "Women undergoing the menopause\u00a0are experiencing profound and widespread mental health\u00a0issues because of a severe shortage of\u00a0Hormone Replacement Therapy\u00a0(HRT) medication, experts have warned.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/11/11/23/web-HRT-rex.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
