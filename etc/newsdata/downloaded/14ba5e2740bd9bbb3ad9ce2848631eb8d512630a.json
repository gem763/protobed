It is expected to pass, which would send it for a vote by the full House.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that committee was also working on its version of the legislation, hoping to hold its markup next week.\n\nThe bill\u2019s text will not be final until it passes both houses of Congress, and it must be signed by President Donald Trump to become law.\n\nThe current version of the House bill calls for annual evaluations of whether Hong Kong still meets the conditions - including remaining autonomous - of the 1992 U.S. law granting it special economic status.\n\nIt also would require the Trump administration to identify and sanction anyone responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Republican Representative Chris Smith, one of the bill\u2019s lead sponsors, told the news conference.\n\nTrump has sent some mixed signals on the Hong Kong protests. In early August, he caused alarm among those sympathetic to the movement by describing the street demonstrations as riots.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Protesters march to call for the United States Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in Hong Kong, China September 8, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nTrump has since called on China to end the discord in a humanitarian way and said a crackdown could make his efforts to end a damaging trade war \u201cvery hard.\u201d\n\nSome industry groups worry that the legislation could threat then delicate trade talks. Backers rejected that concern.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let commercial interests drive our policy,\u201d Pelosi said.", "description": "U.S. congressional committees are due to start voting next week on legislation supporting human rights in Hong Kong, with measures under consideration including annual reviews of the Chinese territory's special economic status and the imposition of sanctions on those who undermine its autonomy.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431335464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1QC", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
