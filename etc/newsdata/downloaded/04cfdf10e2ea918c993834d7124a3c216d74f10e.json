The EU has distanced itself from the visit, saying each politician was acting in a private capacity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

I have been to Afghanistan and Syria and I have seen what terrorism has done. We stand with India in its fight against terrorists.\u201d\n\nBill Newton Dunn, the only Lib Dem MEP on the trip and one of a handful of political centrists, said the group \u201cwant to see India becoming the most peaceful country in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor that we need to stand by India in its fight against global terrorism. This visit has been an eye-opener and we would definitely advocate what we have seen on ground zero,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the Hindustan Times, Lars Patrick Berg - an Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland MEP who was among four of the 27 to skip the Srinagar leg of the visit - said he had been \u201cextremely happy\u201d to meet Mr Modi. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not every day that the PM of a country interacts with ordinary parliamentarians like us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Indian media hadn\u2019t made a \u201cfair assessment\u201d of the European visitors. \u201cContrary to popular perception\u2026 conservative groups in the European Parliament are not Muslim-hating Nazis,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

There are those who live by the law and those who don\u2019t, in every society.\u201d\n\nCritics of the trip have pointed to a statement by another Lib Dem MEP, Chris Davies, who said he was barred from taking part after insisting the parliamentarians be guaranteed unfettered access to properly assess the situation in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cI am not prepared to take part in a PR stunt for the Modi government and pretend that all is well. It is very clear that democratic principles are being subverted in Kashmir, and the world needs to start taking notice,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd attention has also turned to the mysterious background of the think-tank responsible for funding and organising the visit, the International Institute for Non-aligned Studies (IINS).\n\nA spokesperson for the main opposition Congress party asked how IINS founder Madi Sharma, who he dubbed an \u201cinternational business broker\u201d, was able to guarantee a group of mostly far-right MEPs \u201can appointment with the Prime Minister\u201d.\n\n\u201cWill the prime minister tell as to who is Madi Sharma? What is BJP\u2019s connection to\u2026 International Institute for Non-aligned Studies? Why has MEA (foreign ministry) been completely sidelined?\u201d he asked.\n\nRandeep Surjewala also accused the BJP of breaching the decades-old policy of treating Kashmir as an internal matter, \u201ccommitt[ing] the gravest sin of reversing this policy\u2026 deliberately internationalis[ing] the Kashmir issue\u201d.\n\nThe MEA did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the MEPs\u2019 visit.\n\nBut it concluded one day before India was due to formally split up Jammu and Kashmir state into two federal territories on Thursday, a decisive measure which has led to increased violence and protests in recent days.\n\nThe two new union territories, one consisting of Jammu and Kashmir and the other of the Buddhist enclave of Ladakh, will come under direct control from Delhi and the region will lose the right to make its own laws.\n\nOn Thursday, G C Murmu, a former bureaucrat from Mr Modi's home state of Gujarat, will be sworn in as the first lieutenant governor of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the government said. Another former civil servant, Radha Krishna Mathur, will take office as the lieutenant governor of Ladakh.\n\nWajahat Habibullah, a former bureaucrat who served in Kashmir and travelled to the region's main city last month, told the Reuters news agency the loss of statehood was yet another humiliating setback for a region that has faced strict restrictions on movement and communications since 5 August.\n\n\u201cWhatever the attitude of (federal) governments in the past, [Kashmiris] at least felt they had something of their own. Now, there is a kind of feeling of having lost whatever freedom they had,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Right-wing European parliamentarians on a visit to the restive Kashmir region said they supported India\u2019s \u201cfight against global terrorism\u201d, while rejecting criticism of their political stances.
