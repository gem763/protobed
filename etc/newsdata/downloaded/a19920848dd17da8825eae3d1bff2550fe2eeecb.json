Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei was down 0.4%; South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose. U.S. stock futures were in the red, but European markets were expected to open higher.\n\nProtesters build barricades outside terminals at Hong Kong International Airport, September 1, 2019. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis\n\nChina\u2019s offshore yuan was a touch weaker 7.17 per dollar but did not breach last week\u2019s lows. Much of the currency market\u2019s attention was on euro/dollar\u2019s slide below $1.10 on Friday for the first time in more than two years. The pair was pushing lower again first thing on Monday.\n\nWithout an immediate trigger, the focus is already on the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank meetings later this month. Fed officials indicated they were reluctant to engage in deep interest rate cuts just yet, despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to do so. A quarter-point Fed rate cut is now fully priced for September. Chances of a half-point cut were only one in five.\n\nAlongside ECB speculation, attention in Europe is on political developments. The UK parliament returns from summer recess tomorrow. It will have just a week to act to frustrate PM Boris Johnson\u2019s push for a possible no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 before being suspended until mid-October.\n\nLegal action against the parliamentary suspension is expected to begin on Tuesday as well, with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn due to make a keynote speech on moves to prevent a no-deal later on Monday.\n\nJohnson has threatened rebels within his own party with expulsion if they vote against the government on any no- confidence measure or for moves to stop no deal \u2013 raising speculation that his resulting likely loss of his one-seat working majority means a snap election might be called as soon as this week.\n\nSterling held firm, with traders focusing on the net impact of all the week\u2019s developments and the growing chances of yet another delay in the Brexit deadline.\n\nElsewhere, U.S. Treasury yields were steady, but the yield curve from both three months and two years out to 10 years remained inverted. Italian 10-year sovereign yields held just above 1% after plunging below that level for the first time last week as a new Italian government coalition formed without the League party of former deputy PM Matteo Salvini.\n\nIn emerging markets, Argentina\u2019s financial crisis worsened over the weekend as the government imposed foreign-exchange controls to limit the peso\u2019s slide and the loss of the country\u2019s hard-cash reserves.\n\nIn European corporate news, Germany's TLG Immobilien bought a 10% stake in rival Aroundtown for $1.14 billion and said it was considering a potential deal with the company. The purchases values the shares at 8.3 euros per share, a 10% premium to Friday's close, and shares were trading up about 7%. TLG shares were up about 2.6%.\n\nThe real estate sector rallied on Friday after a German newspaper reported the rent freeze planned by Berlin\u2019s regional government might be less strict than previously expected.\n\nAirbus SE may get a lift from fresh concern that Boeing's 737 MAX will be grounded for longer than expected. Citing government and pilot union officials, the Wall Street Journal said friction between the company and international air-safety authorities threatens a new delay in bringing Boeing aircraft back into service.\n\nOn Sunday, American Airlines extended its cancellations of 737 MAX flights through Dec. 3 but said it remains confident that the aircraft will be approved to fly again this year, following new software and pilot training. Worries about delays could hurt big users of the aircraft in Europe like TUI and Ryanair.\n\nAn Italian court has ruled in favour of French media giant Vivendi in the ongoing legal wrangling over the restructuring plan for Mediaset, although the decision was not enough to scupper the deal.\n\n\u2014 A look at the day ahead from EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
