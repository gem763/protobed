This time, the spotlight is on former NHL player Donald Brashear.\n\nOn Wednesday, Le Journal de Quebec detailed Brashear's new job serving customers at a local Tim Hortons. Brashear fell on hard times following his NHL career, both personal and financial, and it appears he is using this job to help get back on his feet and re-establish himself. This decision should be applauded, supported and championed, not fodder for gossip.\n\nPAUL BATURA: COP WITH 35 YEARS ON THE STREETS OFFERS FIVE POWERFUL LESSONS FOR LIFE\n\nBrashear\u2019s story is just one example of a concerning trend of blue-collar jobs being depicted as a low point in someone\u2019s life, rather than an opportunity.\n\nFormer Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin didn\u2019t have a college degree \u2014 he dropped out after three years to take a job with the American Red Cross \u2014 and fielded criticism for years that his lack of a diploma meant he wasn\u2019t qualified to lead.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn February, Elizabeth Warren said her father \"ended up\" a janitor while she had more opportunities, insinuating that being a janitor was somehow below value, raising questions from voters across the country.\n\nAnd in last week\u2019s Democratic debate, Sen. Cory Booker paid lip service to the dignity of work, but his record doesn\u2019t reflect someone who truly values it.\n\nBooker, like Warren and many of their Democratic colleagues, supports liberal policies across the country that are designed to keep able-bodied adults out of work, including waivers and efforts against work requirements for able-bodied adults. With record-low unemployment and millions of job openings, there hasn\u2019t been a better time in recent history to be a worker here in America. But instead of encouraging people to enter the workforce and empower them through work, we\u2019re seeing them promote the alternative \u2014 dependency.\n\nThere is dignity in all work, and many pathways to success \u2014 but everyone has to start somewhere.\n\nOur country\u2019s story is a rich tapestry of men and women working their way up the economic ladder and boosting the next generation even higher than themselves. Many of our current and former leaders worked on farms, flipped burgers at McDonald\u2019s (like former Speaker Paul Ryan), or were once on welfare (like Rep. Ted Yoho). I had my first taste of work babysitting in my early teens and then taught gymnastics and cheerleading through high school and college.\n\nOur backgrounds are like millions of others across the country, and in each of these cases, working-class jobs weren\u2019t what defined us as people. They were one part of our stories. After all, there is dignity in all work, and many pathways to success \u2014 but everyone has to start somewhere.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the piece on Brashear\u2019s work at Tim Hortons was mislabeled. It isn\u2019t a poor-me story of a man who fell from grace. It\u2019s a comeback story, and an inspiration to people who feel like giving up when the life they thought they\u2019d have didn\u2019t go according to plan.\n\nIf our goal is to see people get through difficult life situations and past bad decisions and come out on the side of success, we cannot then shame them for their efforts to do so.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo one is *just* a janitor or *just* a factory worker\u2014these are paths towards a better life and a way for people to take care of themselves and their families.\n\nThis country was built on a foundation of hard work. It's inherent to the fabric of who we are, and something we need to encourage for generations to come.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM WHITNEY MUNRO", "description": "Our country\u2019s story is a rich tapestry of men and women working their way up the economic ladder and boosting the next generation even higher than themselves.", "authors": ["Whitney Munro", "Whitney Munro Is The Vice President Of Communications At The Foundation For Government Accountability."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/whitney.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
