A spokesperson for PSA said the group \u201cwould not comment on market rumours\u201d. FCA declined to comment.\n\nThis year shares in PSA have risen 38 per cent compared with barely 1 per cent for FCA. The French company has a market value of \u20ac23.6 billion ($38 billion), equivalent to $US26.2 billion, while FCA\u2019s sits at about $US22 billion.\n\nThe revived talks come months after FCA withdrew its proposal for a \u20ac33 billion merger with Renault, just days after the original proposal was made.\n\nThe deal fell apart in June after the French government, Renault\u2019s largest shareholder with just over 15 per cent, held back its support \u2014 ostensibly since Renault\u2019s alliance partner Nissan was not fully on board.\n\nAnalysts were positive that a deal to combine Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler was back on the table.\n\n\u201cTiming aside, there is clearly the potential for significant gross synergies [in the] \u20ac7b range over 2021-2023,\u201d wrote Arndt Ellinghorst at Evercore. He added that Mr Tavares had proven himself a highly effective turnround boss, citing Opel which PSA bought in 2017.\n\n\u201cFCA needs scale in Europe and PSA has no presence in the US, where FCA has market share for sale,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, an autos analyst at Jefferies. \u201cPSA also has the technology to help with FCA\u2019s carbon emission issues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe French state\u2019s 12 per cent stake in PSA was also \u201clikely to prove less of a barrier than it did to a merger with Renault\u201d, said Mr Houchois, in part since there would be no third party involved.\n\nOther analysts have suggested the French state would be reluctant to be seen as a block to another deal.\n\nSergio Marchionne, FCA\u2019s longstanding chief executive, before his death last summer, argued for years for consolidation in the auto sector in the face of disruption from new technology and consumer saturation in his company\u2019s home car markets.\n\nHe publicly pursued a tie-up with General Motors in 2015 but was rejected by Mary Barra, the US company\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThe Agnelli and Peugeot families held talks a decade ago, before Fiat decided to pursue Chrysler.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "The discussions mark an attempt by France\u2019s PSA and its chief executive Carlos Tavares to take advantage of a failed combination earlier this year between FCA and rival French carmaker Renault.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dd32f447472e9c22289bc701c04ec49fd6122483", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
