Retinol\n\nRetinol (vitamin-A derivative) is an anti-aging hero and helps fix almost everything, including wrinkles, dullness, oiliness, sagging skin and age spots. It also treats acne and skin conditions like keratosis pilaris, which is why so many dermatologists recommend it.\n\nRetinol works by speeding up cell turnover and collagen production for smoother and younger-looking skin.\n\nWe recommend: Elizabeth Arden Retinol Ceramide Capsules Line Erasing Night Serum, \u00a332 (save \u00a310)\n\nThis high-quality retinol from Elizabeth Arden won't break the bank, as it costs just \u00a332, and it claims to be 76 per cent more potent than non-encapsulated retinol. The award-winning retinol capsules have been dubbed as 'silky', 'fast absorbing' and 'exceptionally good' by Amazon shoppers.\n\nUnlike other retinols, this serum from Elizabeth Arden has been formulated with ceramides to boost moisture and help protect against the dryness often associated with retinol. But be careful, retinols are sensitive to sunlight so should be used in the evening, and make sure to follow up with your usual SPF during daylight hours.\n\nBuy now on Amazon\n\n2. Peptides\n\nPeptides are short chains of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) that signal skin cells to produce and stimulate more collagen, making them ideal for firming skin and smoothing wrinkles. The ones with most science behind them are Matrixyl and Argireline.\n\nWe recommend: The Ordinary Matrixyl 10% + HA High Strength Peptide Formulation, \u00a39.60\n\nThe Ordinary Matrixyl 10% + HA High Strength Peptide Formulation is very high strength peptide formula that visibly targets the look of static (always there) and dynamic (forming with muscle motion) wrinkles. The addition of hyaluronic acid provides a boost of hydration and a little goes a long way.\n\nBuy now on Lookfantastic\n\n3. Sunscreen\n\nWe hate to break it to you, but more often than not signs of aging, including wrinkling and loss of elasticity, are caused by unprotected sun exposure. Applying a broad spectrum sunscreen rated SPF 30 or higher daily is the most important thing you can do to protect your skin from UVA harm and stop these early signs of aging.\n\nWe recommend: Zelens Daily Defence Sunscreen SPF 30, \u00a355\n\nTo ensure you're getting sufficient protection, your sunscreen must state that it's a broad spectrum protection and be rated SPF 30 or higher. For even more benefits, it should contain a mix of antioxidants. Zelens Daily Defence Sunscreen ticks all the boxes and includes an additional dose of vitamin C to brighten dull skin and lighten pigmentation spots.\n\nBuy now on Lookfantastic\n\n4. Vitamin C\n\nSpeaking of vitamin C, this powerful antioxidant protects skin from free radicals (such as sunlight, smoke and pollution), and it also brightens. Vitamin C builds collagen and increases cell turnover to lighten hyperpigmentation to keep skin from looking dull.\n\nWe recommend: KORA Organics Noni Bright Vitamin C Serum, \u00a360\n\nKORA Organics Noni Bright Vitamin C Serum is a vegan and cruelty-free serum that's formulated with a potent dose of 12% ascorbyl glucoside, a water-soluble derivative of vitamin C that sinks into skin quickly upon application, so your skin cells reap all the benefits before it destabilises.\n\nBuy now on Space NK\n\n5. Glycolic acid\n\nThis exfoliator safely treats lines and discoloration on all skin types. It comes in lotions and face washes, but individually wrapped pads are most effective because the pH of glycolic can change when it's exposed to air.\n\nWe recommend: Dr Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Peel, Extra Strength, \u00a315\n\nTry Dr Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Peel once a week to avoid irritation. The first step pad contains five acids; glycolic, lactic, malic, citric and salicyclis - and the second contains retinol, along with all its anti-ageing benefits.\n\nTargeted at those with oily skin, imperfections, uneven tone, texture, wrinkles or enlarged pores, the chemical exfoliator by Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare penetrates deep into the skin, breaking down the 'glue' that keeps dead skin cells stuck to the skin's surface to lift it away, along with excess oil and impurities, while improving uneven tone and texture. They deliver excellent results.\n\nBuy now on Amazon\n\nCheck out our discount section for Amazon deals and offers.\n\nMailOnline may earn commission on sales from the links on this page.", "description": "If you're serious about anti-aging, stick with the skincare ingredients that work and have proven benefits.", "authors": ["Emily Knott For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19759860-0-image-a-165_1571173468834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
