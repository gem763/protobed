Enhanced R&D: Pideka\u2019s research team has several R&D projects underway, including a research project with the Pontifical Bolivarian University of Medellin for the treatment of colon cancer with cannabinoids. With its roots in medicinal cannabis research, Pideka\u2019s founders have treated over 1,600 patients to date and registered 55 cannabis strains with the Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (\u201cICA\u201d), Colombia\u2019s principal agricultural research institute.\n\nAbout Pideka SAS\n\nPideka is a Colombian cannabis company with licenses to cultivate, produce, manufacture and export cannabis derivatives, extracts and seeds for medical, scientific and commercial use. Pideka obtained its first license to produce and process cannabis derivatives in April 2017 and was awarded an additional license to cultivate psychoactive cannabis in August 2018. In March 2019, Pideka was registered with the Colombian government as an agronomic evaluation unit and an asexual selected seed producer.\n\nCurrently, Pideka is awaiting final agronomic evaluation test results for Phase 1 development of Casa Flores, which it anticipates receiving this quarter. The agronomic evaluation test is a process used to approve and register a new variety of plant for commercialization. This comprehensive test is intended to confirm the characteristics of the plant and that the species is both homogeneous and unaffected by systemic issues. Pideka has followed the process set forth by ICA, utilizing the required grouping of 60 plants per strain and a stringent data collection process during cultivation. It is required to collect and record specific data for height, production, weight and cannabinoid compounds throughout the entire cultivation cycle, per ICA standards. Upon successful completion of the harvest cycle, all recorded data must be submitted to ICA for review and approval. Pending successful verification of the plant and phytochemical characterization of the extracts by ICA, the strain will be approved, registered and permitted for commercialization.\n\n\n\nStrategic Alignments\n\nPideka has aligned itself with numerous Colombian academic and government agencies in order to continue the development of standardized processes and medicinal based therapies:\n\nApril 2019: signed agreement with Tadeo Lozano University (\u201cUTL\u201d) to initiate, develop and validate internationally recognized analytical methods for phytochemical characterizations of cannabis compounds, using the ISO 17025 accredited laboratory of UTL.\n\nJuly 2019: signed agreement with AGROSAVIA, a division of ICA, for R&D and innovation projects related to medical / scientific cannabis production.\n\nJuly 2019: signed agreement with Pontifical Bolivarian University of Medellin to initiate a research project focused on treatment of colon cancer with cannabinoids through nanotechnology.\n\nCasa Flores Development Phases\n\nPhase 1 construction of Casa Flores is underway. Upon completion of this phase, the facility will provide 80,000 sq. ft. of space for indoor cultivation, processing and finished product manufacturing. The cultivation component of Casa Flores will consist of 24 flower rooms and use a vertical cultivation system. The anticipated annual production is approximately 16,000 lbs. of dried flower. Casa Flores\u2019 first commercial harvest is targeted for Q2 2020.\n\nPhase 2 of development will add an additional 260,000 sq. ft. of cultivation space, bringing the completed Casa Flores complex to 340,000 sq. ft. The anticipated annual production is approximately 52,000 lbs. of dried flower. The first harvest from Phase 2 is targeted for Q3 2021.\n\nLong-term Scalability\n\nThe acquisition of Pideka gives Ik\u00e4nik the ability to add significant scale to its operations through \u201cCampo Esmeralda\u201d, the third planned phase of Ik\u00e4nik\u2019s strategic expansion in Colombia. The preliminary build plan for Campo Esmeralda is intended to take place on 40 of Pideka\u2019s total 3,200 acres, providing Ik\u00e4nik with an additional 1,900,000 sq. ft. of cultivation, production and manufacturing capabilities.
