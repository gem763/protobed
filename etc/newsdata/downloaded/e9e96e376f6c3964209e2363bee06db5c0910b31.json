One hundred and ten digital health companies exited via acquisition in 2018, while the IPO drought stretched through a second year.\n\nWith the surge in funding, and absence of an equally robust exit market, there is more scrutiny on digital health than ever before, begging the question: will value creation track with recent investment trends? Given that over $30B in venture dollars have been invested in digital health since 2011, and assuming investors expect an approximate 4X return over 10 years, the market should grow to $120B in the next 4-6 years. That is a pretty large number, but with a $3.5T healthcare market, this magnitude of return is conceivable. However, with today\u2019s high but as-yet-unrealized expectations, we aren\u2019t surprised to see the b-word increasingly pop up in conversations.\n\nSo for part one of our two-part year-end funding recap, we dive headfirst into the question: is digital health in a bubble?\n\nPlease note: our op-ed published in CNBC reflects our funding data tallied through mid-December, as opposed to end-of-year. This accounts for the difference in the reported data between the two articles.\n\nBut first, what exactly is a bubble?\n\nWe\u2019re defining an investment bubble as an economic cycle in which asset prices rise far beyond what is justified by fundamentals. When investors become wary of a bubble, they freeze new investments, causing a sharp contraction in prices that \u201cbursts\u201d the bubble. At that point, venture-backed startups that need access to fresh capital struggle to remain solvent\u2014often regardless of their fundamentals\u2014as valuations plummet.\n\nA bursting bubble is not just a down cycle\u2014it\u2019s a rout.\n\nPutting digital health within the broader VC context\n\nTo assess the future trajectory of VC funding for digital health, we started with two factors: (1) the health of the economy as a whole, and (2) the dynamics driving investment in healthcare innovation.\n\nAs for the first factor, investment bubbles in specific sectors are inextricably linked to the general economy and venture investment overall. Digital health is no exception. Investment in digital health has mirrored the growth in venture investment overall: both digital health and overall VC investment hit decade-high deal values in 2018 just as the public market bull run reached its 10-year anniversary.\n\nAn increase in public market volatility, a recent stock market correction, and shifting macroeconomic forces set a different, more restrained backdrop going into 2019.\n\nGiven the signs in the public market, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see venture funding for digital health flatten somewhat over the next few years. We estimate digital health to be nearly 10% of overall venture funding today\u2014something that we expect to remain fairly stable (and will watch more closely than the top-line number for total investment).", "description": "2018 Year End Funding Report: Is digital health in a bubble? | Rock Health | We're powering the future of healthcare.
