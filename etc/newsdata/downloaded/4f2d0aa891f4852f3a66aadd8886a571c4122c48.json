Scientists have delivered important reports about its urgent dangers, political leaders have made pledges to fight it, and youth climate activists have marched in the streets. New ideas about electric vehicles, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and adaptation will enrich the conversation about climate action. But one critical topic isn\u2019t discussed enough: industrial heat.\n\nMost people have no experience with heavy industry \u2013 such as manufacturing cement, steel, fuels, chemicals and glass \u2013 so they don\u2019t know about its effects on the climate. But these processes generate 22 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, with industrial heat alone releasing 10 per cent. Despite its role, heavy industry is conspicuously absent from climate conversations.\n\n11-year-old climate activist asks, why worry about development when there's no future?\n\nIndustrial products are essential for construction, infrastructure and manufacturing, but making them requires a lot of heat and this emits more carbon dioxide than all the world\u2019s cars and planes.\n\nMany industrial processes start with melting rocks by burning fossil fuels. To make glass, for example, you melt sand and pour it on melted tin. This needs heat and that heat is needed every day. Few alternative processes make enough heat on demand. But the situation isn\u2019t hopeless.\n\nClimate change and human action: what these Hong Kong students learned in Madagascar\n\nThe Centre on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in the US has compared most of the available alternatives (nuclear, hydrogen, electrification and biofuels) on the basis of viability, cost and environmental effect. Carbon capture, use and storage is essential to reducing carbon emissions from heavy industry. Our analysis shows it\u2019s more affordable than almost any other option. Carbon capture also supports the production of one of the most viable and versatile low-carbon fuels: hydrogen. Most hydrogen \u2013 95 per cent worldwide \u2013 is made by reforming natural gas and steam molecules at high temperature (which itself consumes lots of heat). It\u2019s possible to capture 50-90 per cent of the carbon dioxide from hydrogen production and keep it from the air and oceans forever. This is already being done commercially at four sites worldwide (soon to be six).\n\nThis low-carbon hydrogen, known as \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen, is available on a large scale and can reach temperatures of 2,200 degrees Celsius at many sites today. Using this method would drop emissions overnight.\n\nIt would also create future opportunities for \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen, made from zero-carbon electricity and water. As renewables become cheaper and more reliable, we can begin to swap green hydrogen for blue hydrogen, based on cost, performance and carbon footprint.\n\nChinese scientists discover new way to mine rare earth metals that is faster, and causes less pollution\n\nOur study shows more and better options are required. Certainly, the US can lead the world on this matter. It has a strong record on innovation and enormous resources that provide low-cost feedstocks and abundant energy.\n\nIndustrial heat is the next frontier, and nations that lead this charge will thrive in a carbon-constrained world. Those that don\u2019t, won\u2019t. It\u2019s our call whether the US will lead here as we have before.\n\nJulio Friedmann is senior research scholar at the Centre on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University", "description": "Heavy industries, such as manufacturing cement and steel, generate 22 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet they are absent from climate conversations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/6bb182ca-f712-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires183131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
