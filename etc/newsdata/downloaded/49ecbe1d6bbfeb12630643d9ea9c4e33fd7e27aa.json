They also used a projector to light up Lam\u2019s face and the wall behind her with protesters\u2019 key demands.\n\nLam left the chamber and then came back about 20 minutes later to try again, only to be met with further fury. One legislator brandishing a placard climbed onto a desk. Again, the council president stopped the session and Lam left. One lawmaker wearing a paper mask showing the face of Chinese President Xi Jinping tossed a placard as Lam walked out.\n\nFinally, 75 minutes after the previously scheduled start of the lengthy address, Lam delivered it via video link, with China\u2019s yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong\u2019s flag on her left.\n\nDescribing the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as going through \u201cmajor crisis,\u201d Lam said: \u201cPeople are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?\u201d\n\nShe appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to \u201ccherish the city,\u201d warning that \u201ccontinued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nStanding ramrod-straight, she then launched into a dry and detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong\u2019s shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent, and other welfare issues. With its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for development, the 50-minute speech titled \u201cTreasure Hong Kong our home\u201d only fueled criticism that Lam is deaf to protesters\u2019 concerns about the future of the territory\u2019s freedoms, unique in China.\n\nIn a subsequent news conference, Lam again made clear that she wouldn\u2019t resign and insisted there has been no erosion \u201cwhatsoever\u201d of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is still a very free society,\u201d she said.\n\nEven before Lam delivered her speech, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed it as a \u201cshame and a sham\u201d and said the chief executive had lost all authority.\n\n\u201cShe is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,\u201d Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam\u2019s address there.\n\nThey played a recording on a small loudspeaker they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters\u2019 wails.\n\n\u201cThese are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,\u201d said lawmaker Tanya Chan. \u201cPlease, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don\u2019t let us suffer any more.\u201d\n\nShe and others called for Lam\u2019s resignation. \u201cThis is the only way that we can have a good future,\u201d said Chan.\n\nPro-Beijing legislators condemned the disruption, among them Martin Liao, who called it \u201ctotally unforgivable.\u201d\n\nLam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement.\n\nThe widespread use of tear gas by riot-control squads and 2,600 arrests, widely decried as heavy handed, have triggered public disgust with the 30,000-strong police force once considered among Asia\u2019s finest. Hardcore black-clad and masked protesters have responded with widespread vandalism of China-linked businesses, subway stations and other targets, and attacked police with gasoline bombs and other weapons.\n\nThis month, two police shootings that injured teenage protesters, the stabbing of a police officer, and the detonation of a small, remote-controlled bomb close to police officers ratcheted up violence to levels unprecedented since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nSaying rioters are \u201cspreading chaos and fear,\u201d Lam appealed for order and sought to end her address on a positive note. Her Facebook profile was updated before she spoke, with a photo of a smiling Lam against a backdrop of a rainbow over Hong Kong\u2019s harbor.\n\n\u201cWe have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI thoroughly believe that Hong Kong will be able to ride out this storm and move on.\u201d", "description": "Lam walked out and later delivered her address by video, as pro-democracy lawmakers held up placards showing her waving with hands colored blood-red.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da6fa57200000a40d505d72.jpeg?cache=kxybxugvsv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
