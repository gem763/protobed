It also alleges the ongoing grounding of the 737 MAX \u2014 which has resulted in thousands of flight cancellations at many airlines including Southwest \u2014 has reduced the pilots' opportunities for work. This has resulted in lost compensation to pilots of more than $100 million, the complaint states.\n\n\"It is critical that Boeing takes whatever time is necessary to safely return the MAX to service,\" Jonathan Weaks, president of the union, said in the statement. \"Our pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing's negligence.\"\n\nBoeing has already taken a huge financial hit from its troubles with the 737 MAX. In the most recent quarter , Boeing reported its largest loss ever \u2014 a $3.7 billion adjusted loss \u2014 as a result of the grounding. The company has also said it will set up a fund to distribute $100 million to the families of people who died in the crashes.\n\n\"Boeing has the greatest respect for the men and women who fly for Southwest Airlines,\" a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. \"While we value our long relationship with [the pilots union], we believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it. We will continue to work with Southwest Airlines and its pilots on efforts to safely return the MAX to service.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Pilots for Southwest Airlines have sued Boeing over $100 million in lost compensation they say was caused by the grounding of its 737 MAX plane.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190718103733-01-southwest-airlines-737-max-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
