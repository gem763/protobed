That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. But the president\u2019s fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him.\n\nAmerica First Policies is a super PAC permitted to raise and spend unlimited sums of money but must disclose both fundraising and expenses. As a super PAC, the group is prohibited from directly coordinating with either the Republican National Committee or Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe ads are being run by the America First non-profit arm, which is not required to disclose how much money it raises or spends, but is prohibited from funding advertisements that directly advocate voting for or against a candidate.\n\nThe ads will point to the \u201ckitchen-table\u201d issues that Democrats campaigned on during the 2018 congressional elections, like healthcare and the border.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re doing nothing, all you do is investigate, investigate, investigate,\u201d the source said, summarizing the intended message. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to action.\u201d\n\nThe ads will target districts that elected Democrats in 2018 after going for Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be putting pressure on moderate Democrats,\u201d the source said.", "description": "America First Policies, a political action group backing U.S. President Donald Trump, will launch an advertising campaign aimed at vulnerable House Democrats who support the impeachment inquiry against him, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters.", "authors": ["Ginger Gibson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
