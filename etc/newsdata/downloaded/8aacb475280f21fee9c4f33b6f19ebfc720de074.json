Hours later, forensic investigators reached a different conclusion. The body was not a baby, they determined, but a hyper-realistic doll. Its blue-grey skin? The result of artistry, not abuse.\n\n\u201cIt appeared to be a baby with discolouration consistent with the signs of prolonged death, but thankfully, it was actually a lifelike prop,\u201d the FDNY said in a statement to WABC-TV. To complete its zombie-inspired look, the doll even sported a onesie reading \u201cThe Crawling Dead.\u201d\n\nThankfully, a lifelike prop. (Photo: NYPD)\n\nOnline, these realistic fake babies are known as \u201creborns\u201d \u2014 a reference to their incredible verisimilitude \u2014 and a devoted community has been crafting and collecting them since at least the late \u201890s. Horror-themed reborns like the New York zombie baby are a more recent development, but even when the dolls are a healthy shade of brown or pink, it\u2019s hard to describe them without using words like \u201cuncanny,\u201d \u201cundead,\u201d or \u201creally fucking weird.\u201d\n\nBy now, a subculture like the reborn scene isn\u2019t that surprising. We all know how easy it is to find fellow travellers on the internet, whether that path is political, carnal, or (in this case) maternal. More shocking is the incredible cost of reborn dolls. Sure, if you\u2019re happy with a mass-produced fake baby from China, you can get one for a couple hundred bucks. You\u2019ll only have yourself to blame when little Hunter\u2019s skin starts to flake off in chunks. And if your dream baby is more monster than man, a custom job is pretty much the only way to go.\n\nOn Etsy, one can find for sale dozens of \u201cfantasy reborns\u201d resembling neonatal dragons, aliens, werewolves and vampires. A handmade baby mermaid can be had for around $750. A miniature Shrek? That will be $580, thanks.\n\nMar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez Porto has been making reborns for more than half a decade and now sells dolls like \u201cMutant Dragon, can drink and pee,\u201d priced at $2,300. She told Gizmodo that her prices reflect the cost of high-quality materials and the extensive work that goes into each doll, which is \u201cnever exactly the same as another and in most cases is totally customised.\u201d If a doll is made of silicone, she said, painting alone can take four weeks.\n\n\u201cI believe that the appeal of this type of doll, in the case of fantasies, is precisely that: It is a fantasy baby,\u201d explained Porto. \u201cThere are many people who like the dream and fantasy world (the world of vampires, dragons, fairies) or are followers and collectors of movie sagas and here they find another piece for their collection \u2014 but with a more real look and feel.\u201d\n\nPorto says that she loves bringing these ideas to life, and a quick glance at her Etsy shop\u2019s reviews suggests a strong mutual benefit from each sale.\n\n\u201cThis baby is exactly as described, it shipped on time, communication was great I love love love it ????,\u201d gushes one satisfied customer, who paid more than $1,450 for \u201cPremature Dragon can drink and pee.\u201d If a peeing dragon baby brings someone that much joy, who are we to judge?\n\nAt love\u2019s heels, however, scurries the eternal threat of loss. The owner of the zombie baby found in Queens was never identified, and a police spokesperson told Gizmodo there have been no developments in the case. Somewhere in the labyrinth that is the New York City justice system, a doll parent\u2019s undead child may still be sitting in a box marked \u201cevidence.\u201d But evidence of what?", "description": "On an otherwise mild June morning, a woman was jogging by the ballfields and elm trees of Crocheron Park in Queens when she spotted something horrific: a tiny body lying lifeless in the grass....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nj9061xwtowsjwhvpzut.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
