Rumors were swirling just a few weeks ago that Hill was considering multiple villainous roles in the film, including The Penguin and The Riddler. However, the Oscar-nominated actor has pulled out of negotiations to star in the film opposite Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman for unspecified reasons. Variety reports: \u201cWhy exactly Hill is passing is currently unknown, and insiders tell Variety that when the news was initially reported, it was very early in the negotiations and a deal was far from closing.\u201d\n\nThis comes as quite a shock given that earlier this week it was announced that Big Little Liar Zoe Kravitz landed the role of Selina Kyle a.k.a. Cat Woman in the film. Why anyone would pass up a chance to hang out with Zoe Kravitz is a mystery to us, but there were probably other factors in Hill\u2019s decision to not star in the film. For all those Batman fans saddened by the news of Hill\u2019s departure, here\u2019s some free advice for how to cope with the loss: maybe don\u2019t watch The Joker this weekend (as if you haven\u2019t already seen it) but do listen to Brandi Carlile\u2019s \u201cThe Joke\u201d because the joke\u2019s on them!", "description": "Actor Jonah Hill passes on a role in the upcoming film, The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz for unspecified reasons.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/16-Jonah-Hill.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
