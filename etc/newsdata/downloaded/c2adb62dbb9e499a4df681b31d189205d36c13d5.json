The listed example is finished in white and features the standard black wheels, red mirror caps, and red leather interior that go with the Launch Edition model. That asking price is just a smidge under three times the original price of the car.\n\n\n\nYou might remember that we encountered a similar situation with a Dodge Challenger SRT Demon in late August that was being sold for $165,000, around twice the original sticker for the Demon. In both cases, the cars being sold were part of limited production runs: 1500 for the Supra Launch Edition and 3000 for the Demon. (On October 30, we checked in with the dealer, Larry Roesch Chrysler Jeep Dodge, and the Demon is still for sale and the price is still firm.)\n\nPhoto credit: Bill Penney Toyota More\n\nFor those of you who have been incommunicado and out of the loop, the Supra has captivated the automotive world and has outperformed its sibling, the BMW Z4 convertible. We had the opportunity to test one, and it ran from zero to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds and to 100 mph in only 9.5. We also took a Supra to the dyno, which confirmed our suspicion that Toyota\u2019s claim of 335 horsepower was slightly conservative; the turbocharged inline-six produces a good deal more than that. We also had the opportunity to take the Supra out to Virginia International Raceway this May for C/D's annual Lightning Lap, where it put down a solid lap time of 3:01.4.\n\nEach Launch Edition Supra has special badging on the inside denoting its number in the production run of 1500. There weren't any special VINs except on the first one, which was sold in a charity auction for $2.1 million. We then presumed that it might be the color that makes this car special, but the color breakdown for all Launch Editions was approximately one-third for each of the three colors, black, red, and white. The only thing special about the black and white paint jobs are red-colored mirror caps and a red leather interior. The red interior color won\u2019t be available on a Supra again, making those approximately 1000 cars special in that regard. Red Launch Editions make do with exterior color mirror caps and a black leather interior. All Launch Editions came with black wheels, too, which won\u2019t be offered on future Supras. These small details don't add to the performance of the car, and mechanically the Launch Editions are the same as every other 2020 Supra out there.\n\nUnable to come up with a reason as to why someone would charge such an exorbitant price for a used car with 182 miles on the odometer, we called Bill Penney Toyota to ask; we're waiting for a response but will fill you in when we hear it.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Launch Edition model has 182 miles on the odometer and a price three times the cost of the car as new.", "authors": ["Mihir Maddireddy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TexzEHNHy40YemuNFEIqFg--~B/aD0yNTE7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/road_track_223/1dca316ad039c609f4aabc41f91fed65", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
