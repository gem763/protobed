According to a February 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, medical problems contributed to 66.5% of all bankruptcies in the country.\n\nLetters with information regarding the medical debt being eliminated started going out to families in the middle of September, Howerton said.\n\nThe letter was sent to U.S. military veterans, those who make less than two times the federal poverty level, people for whom 5% percent or more of their annual income goes to paying medical bills and people who have greater medical debt than assets.\n\nJordan Parker/Lake Pointe Church\n\nHowerton said the church collaborated with the nonprofit RIP Medical Debt, an organization that uses donations to buy medical debt at pennies on the dollar, and then forgives the debt. RIP Medical Debt helped Lake Pointe Church identify the recipients.\n\n\"One of the great things the organization does is that it works with the people who hold those debts to be able to negotiate down the payoffs,\" Howerton said. \"So we were able to eliminate $2.6 million of medical debt for around $27,000.\"\n\nCraig Antico, co-founder and chief operating officer of RIP Medical Debt, told ABC News on Thursday that the collaboration with the church began in May 2019, when the church first reached out to the organization about the project.\n\nAntico said more than 200 churches had inquired about RIP Medical Debt and 68 churches have raised money to help eliminate medical debt since the organization was founded in 2014.\n\n\"We really felt that medical debt was something that was inordinately hurting the people that are most vulnerable,\" Antico said. \"The problem is getting worse and worse, and we're just recognizing that we have a way to stop the hardship of this medical debt.\"\n\nHowerton said his church has around 12,000 members across multiple campuses, and he hopes this project inspires members to give back to their communities.\n\n\"We want our people to do one act of kindness per day for the next 40 days,\" Howerton said. \"So, if you do the math, that's 40 days times 12,000 people and half-a-million needs met. That's the vision we have for this campaign.\"", "description": "The church worked with nonprofit RIP Medical Debt, an organization that uses donations to buy medical debt at pennies on the dollar and then forgives the debt.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/church-ht-er-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
