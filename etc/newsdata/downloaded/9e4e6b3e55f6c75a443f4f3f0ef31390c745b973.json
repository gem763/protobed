But in order to capitalize in these categories, John Meyer, Managing Partner of Starship Capital, believes it has a ways to go. \u201cPeloton is a company that doesn't yet have a robust retail exposure,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAnd so without that, it's very difficult to sell these things unless there are stores everywhere where people can try them.\u201d\n\nThat equipment is pricey: Internet-connected bikes start at $2,245 while treadmills run $4,295. Because of these high costs, Meyer suggested that Peloton align itself with another brand known for high-end hardware: Apple (AAPL).\n\n\u201cOne of my views is that Peloton would be much better off selling to a company such as Apple where they're another luxury brand that has retail stores everywhere and could really do a good job at getting people to actually try to use them and buy them on the spot,\u201d said John Meyer, Managing Partner of Starship Capital.\n\nIn addition to the costs of Peloton\u2019s hardware, users must pay an additional monthly $39.00 content subscription fee. The company more than doubled its revenue to $915 million for the year ending in June, but that growth might not hold up if a recession hits.\n\n\u201cWhen you're selling these expensive devices, the first thing people are going to stop buying if we hit a recession are these luxury, high-end devices,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAnd so I think that's another key attribute that's going into the investor decision making here at this point.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "\"Peloton would be much better off selling to a company such as Apple where they're another luxury brand that has retail stores everywhere and could really do a good job at getting people to actually try to use them and buy them on the spot.\u201d", "authors": ["Jennifer Shanker", "Production Assistant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gk01j1Vy_bNebBAbG2d_Uw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/072b32c0-e122-11e9-bb9f-04ca233c5ce5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
