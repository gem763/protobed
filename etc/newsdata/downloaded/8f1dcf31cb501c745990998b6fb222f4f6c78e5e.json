(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nThe NBA got its first glimpse at what Zion Williamson could really be this season on Wednesday, and it looks pretty impressive. And terrifying for the interior defenders in the league.\n\nIn his second preseason game for the New Orleans Pelicans, Williamson posted 29 points on 12-of-13 shooting with four rebounds and four assists in 27 minutes of a 127-125 win over the Chicago Bulls.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThroughout the game, Williamson showed off his trademark versatility scoring the ball. He laid down his trademark dunks, threw in a few lay-ups and, uh, made some free throws too.\n\n\"Zion's gonna need a more complete game, NBA post defenders are much better than college\"\n\nZion: pic.twitter.com/Us6oF7w4oo \u2014 Paid man gets bored (@cjzero) October 10, 2019\n\nKidding aside, you don\u2019t need to do much else when you\u2019re capable of throwing it down like this.\n\nZion (29 PTS | 12-13 FG | 4 REB) was a force tonight. \ud83d\ude24#NBAPreseason pic.twitter.com/qOOYgXfRoe \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) October 10, 2019\n\nObviously, Williamson still has plenty to work on in expanding his offensive game. The basketball world knew that even as he was making highlight after highlight at Duke and being called a generational prospect in the draft process.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Williamson provided a decent explanation Wednesday of why \u2014 even when other parts of his game are a work in progress \u2014 he\u2019s still so exciting. With all the caveats of a preseason game, he is going to run the floor, bully his way in the paint and throw down dunks with the best of them from the get-go.\n\nLike Williamson, the Pelicans still have a lot of work to do, given that they were down 107-86 heading into the fourth quarter and only won on a furious charge from their second unit. That doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be a top option for League Pass users across the country.\n\nUnder head coach Alvin Gentry, the Pelicans are set to be one of the fastest-paced, transition-attacking teams in the league and Williamson is the fast-twitch bowling ball running through the paint that will lead the charge.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Pelicans phenom missed just one field goal attempt out of 13.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8bg25MoTN8tmhiZCAkfkuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMDEwLjEzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w4Ra6ktkChfIpIzzXIvNEw--~B/aD0yODUxO3c9MzYxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e18e5250-eb07-11e9-bfa0-6ca5a4c0cedd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
