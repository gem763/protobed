(Patrick Semansky/Associated Press)\n\nA civil rights organization representing Latino voters filed a lawsuit against the government Tuesday night seeking to prevent it from leaving undocumented people out of congressional apportionment after the 2020 Census.\n\nIn the suit filed against the Commerce Department, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, and the Census Bureau, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) asked a federal judge in Alabama to declare that apportionment must be determined by the total population, as has been longstanding practice.\n\nThe state of Alabama filed a suit last year against the Commerce Department and the Census Bureau, arguing that the current system of apportioning congressional seats gives an unfair electoral advantage to states with more undocumented immigrants.\n\nSeveral states, cities, counties, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, along with the Latino voters, had requested to join the case as intervenors, saying they feared the Justice Department would not defend the Alabama suit wholeheartedly. Although constitutional scholars have said the Alabama suit is unlikely to succeed, intervenors said they were concerned particularly after a July comment by U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr in which he seemed to suggest the Alabama case might succeed.\n\nThe new suit, a cross-claim against co-defendants in the Alabama suit, is necessary in order to \u201cprevent the federal government from voluntarily doing what Alabama seeks to compel,\u201d MALDEF president and general counsel Thomas A. Saenz said.\n\n\u201cJust as we were rightly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s unwillingness to put up the strongest defense against the state of Alabama\u2019s scurrilous contention that our Constitution does not recognize undocumented immigrants as \u2018persons,\u2019 we have filed this cross-claim out of a concern that the Trump administration might choose, on its own, to attempt to discount these persons even after the federal court rejects the state\u2019s allegation that the Constitution compels such a discounting,\u201d he said.\n\nMALDEF also represented plaintiffs in one of several lawsuits that earlier this year successfully challenged the administration\u2019s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n\nA Commerce Department spokesman said he could not comment immediately on the new lawsuit.\n\nEarlier this month in Maryland, MALDEF and another civil rights group, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, sued the government over President Trump\u2019s July executive order for U.S. agencies to provide citizenship information, saying the order violates the Administrative Procedure Act.", "description": "The state has argued that the current system of apportioning congressional seats gives an unfair advantage to states with more undocumented immigrants.", "authors": ["Tara Bahrampour", "Reporter Focusing On Aging", "Generations", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t7lGk5nhypgQve2zgXEYlBsoJEU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FX7YHKXEYUI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
