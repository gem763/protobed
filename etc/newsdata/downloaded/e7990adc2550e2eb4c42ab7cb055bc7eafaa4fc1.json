GAV has increased its DPS from CHF5 to CHF12 in the past 10 years. During this period it has not missed a payment, as one would expect for a company increasing its dividend. These are all positive signs of a great, reliable dividend stock.\n\nThe company currently pays out 80% of its earnings as a dividend, according to its trailing twelve-month data, meaning the dividend is sufficiently covered by earnings. Going forward, analysts expect GAV's payout to increase to 90% of its earnings. Assuming a constant share price, this equates to a dividend yield of around 5.3%.\n\nWhen thinking about whether a dividend is sustainable, another factor to consider is the cash flow. Companies with strong cash flow can sustain a higher payout ratio, while companies with weaker cash flow generally cannot.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWith Carlo Gavazzi Holding producing strong dividend income for your portfolio over the past few years, you can take comfort in knowing that this stock will still continue to be a top dividend generator moving forward. However, given this is purely a dividend analysis, you should always research extensively before deciding whether or not a stock is an appropriate investment for you.
