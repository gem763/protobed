But the tax structures need to be formulated so they shift the momentum towards the premiumisation of wine in the Australian industry.\n\nThis year's Grange 100pc shiraz\n\nMr Gago was speaking after the official opening of a new $10 million-plus cellar door and casual dining area at Penfolds \"spiritual home\" of Magill Estate in the Adelaide foothills designed by architectural firm Denton Corker Marshall.\n\nGrange sells for $785 per bottle. Cole Bennetts\n\nMr Gago says the complex is another step in trying to lift Penfolds into a global luxury brand, and this will be pushed up a notch later in 2015 when the company does the official launch of the latest version of Penfolds Grange in Shanghai in China.\n\nHe says the shift by Treasury chief executive Mike Clarke to releasing Penfolds Grange each year in October instead of May, so that it can capture more of the pre-Christmas gift-giving market, has proven a winner in sales terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was a no-brainer and all it needed was the courage , and the pen of the chief executive to sign off on it\".\n\nMr Gago says Australians generally aren't comfortable with the notion of luxury brands, because of the connotations of \"elitism\" which doesn't sit well with the Australian ethos.\n\n\"It's not part of the Australian psyche,\" he says. But Penfolds is attempting to position itself in the realm of \"understated luxury\" to capture a similar market to the well-known luxury lodges of New Zealand such as Huka Lodge.\n\nMr Gago says the 2011 Penfolds Grange to be released in October, 2015 will be 100 per cent shiraz, which is the first time in 11 years it won't have other grape varieties in it. This has happened only five other times, in 1951, 1952, 1963, 1999 and 2000.", "description": "The man who makes Australia's most famous wines, Penfolds Grange at $785 per bottle, is backing tax changes that would slug cheaper wines with higher taxes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4061%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1970%2C$x_30%2C$y_160/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/79f3a6270091d4a61839a45d536291752e2f9d75", "published_at": "2015-06-04"}
