Sign up here.\n\nHennes & Mauritz AB\u2019s sales growth slowed in the key July and August months, hampering the Swedish retailer\u2019s attempt to end a three-year slump in earnings.\n\nSales growth probably slowed down to 6% in those two months from 12% in June, Berenberg analysts said, based on calculations from figures H&M reported Monday. The shares dropped as much as 3.2%.\n\nH&M has been trying to reducing its high inventory level, which stood at 40 billion kronor ($4.2 billion) at the end of June. The retailer has struggled in recent years as its clothes fell out of favor with shoppers and it launched a plethora of new formats.\n\nRival Inditex SA this month reported an acceleration in sales, while Primark announced a drop in like-for-like revenue. H&M has recently slashed prices to as low as $5.99 for skinny jeans and $17.99 for a dress with a belt.\n\nThe retailer said its summer collections were well-received and it managed to increase market share. The sales increase of 8% in local currencies during the quarter shows that part of the revenue growth is coming from foreign-exchange moves. A weaker krona makes it more expensive to source goods from Asia, which could be cutting into profitability.\n\nH&M was facing easy comparisons with the year-earlier quarter, when logistics issues exacerbated its inventory woes.\n\nThe stock has advanced 47% this year. H&M\u2019s stock can be volatile because short sellers have bet against about a sixth of the company\u2019s freely traded shares, according to IHS Markit data.\n\nH&M is scheduled to report full earnings on Oct. 3.\n\n--With assistance from Hanna Hoikkala.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Marthe Fourcade\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
