I think he wakes up in the morning and says, To hell, I want to be Schwarzenegger.\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger\u2019s beef with the president kicked off in early 2017, when the former Terminator star took over as Trump\u2019s replacement on The Celebrity Apprentice, which was aptly renamed The New Celebrity Apprentice. The show\u2019s ratings stalled, leading Trump to ask a crowd at the usually somber National Prayer Breakfast to \u201cpray for Arnold.\u201d (Schwarzenegger couldn\u2019t resist a shot back, tweeting: \u201cI wish you the best of luck and I hope you\u2019ll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s happy in his own skin,\u201d Schwarzenegger said in today\u2019s interview. \u201cI think he wants to be me.
