Trousers were long, straight and high-waisted.\n\nDresses came in purple, yellow, green, bronze, black and softer colours, and were cut in various styles: from halterneck and asymmetric to low-cut and long-sleeved. Most had feminine ruffles on the neckline, shoulders or waist. Some had floral patterns.\n\n\u201cLightness, easiness, freedom. Those are the ideas I was thinking of for this collection. It\u2019s about dynamic women today, women in motion,\u201d Beckham said in show notes.\n\n\u201cControlled and free, living life, reality and believability. There is always a duality in women, moving between different ideas, different moods. I want clothes that move with a woman, that move with her life.\u201d\n\nBeckham also had dabs of prints in the collection - floral or scribbled-like handwriting.\n\nModels present creations during the Victoria Beckham catwalk show at London Fashion Week in London, Britain, September 15, 2019.

Accessories included floral neckpieces, large brown sunglasses and colourful heels in purple, turquoise and other bold shades.\n\nAhead of the show, around 30 demonstrators from climate activist group Extinction Rebellion staged a protest outside the venue, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, seeking to draw attention to the fashion industry\u2019s impact on the environment.\n\nHolding banners reading \u201cFashion shouldn\u2019t cost the Earth\u201d and \u201cThe Ugly Truth About Fashion\u201d, the protesters gave speeches chanted slogans like \u201cFashion equals ecocide\u201d and \u201cRepair Rewear Rebel\u201d.\n\nWhile walking to the venue, the protesters temporarily stopped traffic on the way while grouping on a main road for a few minutes at a time.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which has staged protests in recent months calling for action to tackle climate change, had called on London Fashion Week organisers to cancel the five-day industry event where designers are unveiling their latest womenswear lines.\n\nAt the Friday opening, a small group of its activists glued themselves to a door of the main Fashion Week venue and poured out a \u201cbleeding\u201d red carpet.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Japanese influences prevailed on the Preen by Thornton Bregazzi catwalk, where models wore tops with Manga comics prints and floral dresses.\n\nPreen designer duo Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi opened the show with black and white looks before presenting an array of pastel-coloured lace, silk and see-though ruffled frocks.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nDresses came in an array of lengths and styles - frilly, layered, floaty, with puffed up sleeves, slits or slim-fit and in bright colours or floral prints.\n\nLondon Fashion Week ends on Tuesday.", "description": "Victoria Beckham chose a light and fluid silhouette for the female wardrobe next spring, presenting a line for \"women in motion\" at her London Fashion Week show on Sunday.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430141293&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0JB", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
