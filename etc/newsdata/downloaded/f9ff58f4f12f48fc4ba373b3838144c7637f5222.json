The library was later barred from participating in the city's pride parade.\n\nIn May, Ms Murphy was invited to the Scottish Parliament to speak on transgender issues as Edinburgh planned reforms to the Gender Recognition Act to allow people to \"self-declare\" their legally recognised gender.\n\nCampaigners at the time said Ms Murphy wanted transgender equality protections \"ripped apart\".\n\nShe was also banned from Twitter for stating that \"men aren't women\" and for \"misgendering\" transgender women on the site. She has taken legal action against the company.", "description": "Hundreds protested as Meghan Murphy gave a controversial talk at a public library in Toronto.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/180E7/production/_109453589_meghanmurphyheadshotnaomi-5932-bw2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
