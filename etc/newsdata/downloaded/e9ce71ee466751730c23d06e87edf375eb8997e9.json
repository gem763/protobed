(AP) - The No. 15 Ducks may have that high-profile loss in the opener to Auburn but the good news is that they haven\u2019t dropped a Pac-12 game - unlike a pair of their northern rivals.\n\nOregon wraps up its nonconference slate Saturday against Montana, the last tuneup before visiting Stanford next week. Early conference games have already impacted the race in the Pac-12 North, with both the Cardinal and Washington suffering league losses. The Ducks were the preseason pick to win the division.\n\nOregon (1-1) was still trying to work out details before looking too far ahead. Coach Mario Cristobal, who emphasized physical play throughout the preseason, spoke about it again as a point of emphasis heading into the game against the FCS-level Grizzlies (2-0).\n\n\u201cSure we\u2019re getting better but we still haven\u2019t seen our best football,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t seen our best performance.\u201d\n\nOregon is coming off a 77-6 rout of Nevada that helped get the team back on track after the disappointing loss to Auburn. Each of senior quarterback Justin Herbert\u2019s five touchdown passes against the Wolf Pack went to different receivers - in fact, 11 different Ducks scored touchdowns.\n\nMontana opened the season with wins over South Dakota and North Alabama, climbing into the STATS FCS Top 25 at No. 20. The Ducks are the second-highest ranked team the Grizzlies have faced in the modern era after a 63-7 loss to No. 7 Washington two years ago.\n\nWhile Oregon has Herbert, Montana has fifth-year senior Dalton Sneed, who has thrown for 696 yards and four touchdowns so far this season. A dual threat, he\u2019s also run for a pair of scores.\n\nSneed, who started his career at UNLV, was the Big Sky\u2019s newcomer of the year last season, when he led the Grizzlies in both passing and rushing. He threw for 2,723 yards and 22 touchdowns while rushing for 675 yards and two more scores last season.\n\nSneed has a fan in Cristobal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a runner, he\u2019s a thrower, he\u2019s the heart and soul to their team. Very tough, will throw his body around, there\u2019s no hesitation in his game whatsoever. The ball is out quick and it\u2019s accurate,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a special player.\u201d\n\nOther things to know about the matchup:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Ducks lead the series 7-0-1 with all the games played in Eugene. The closest the Grizzlies came was a 14-all tie in 1952.\n\nMontana knows what it\u2019s up against Saturday. \u201cWe just need to keep progressing and improving and getting better. That\u2019s what good teams do throughout a season. And certainly, to go in and play the Oregon Ducks we\u2019re going to need a great effort,\u201d Montana coach Bobby Hauck said.\n\nHauk is in his second stint with the Grizzlies. He coached the team from 2003-09 and was brought back prior to the 2018 season.\n\nABOUT THAT LINE\n\nOregon not only has one of the nation\u2019s top quarterbacks, it has a stout offensive line protecting him. The Ducks\u2019 O-linemen have a collective 163 games among them, most in the nation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of Oregon teams over the years, and to me, this is the best offensive line I\u2019ve seen in an Oregon uniform,\u201d Hauck said.\n\nHerbert has thrown for 552 yards and six touchdowns with no interceptions this season.\n\nMR. ELECTRICITY\n\nMontana senior receiver Jerry Louie-McGee needs just three catches to break Raul Pacheco\u2019s career record of 192 set in 1998. Louie-McGee has 1,928 career receiving yards. He returned a punt for a 74-yard touchdown last week against North Alabama to give him three punt return TDs for his career and earn him Big Sky Player of the Week honors. And yes, his nickname is Mr. Electricity among the Grizz faithful.\n\nPAYDAY\n\nMontana will be paid $650,000 for the visit to Eugene. Hauck was asked about those guarantee games during his Monday news conference.\n\n\u201cWith our league having so many members, there aren\u2019t many FCS teams in the western U.S. that aren\u2019t in our league for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, scheduling\u2019s difficult and you have to kind of make it work somehow. For us to be able to get regional games and not have to travel to the East Coast to play games is good.\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\nOregon may see the Ducks debut of graduate transfer Juwan Johnson, a receiver who missed the first two games with a knee injury. Cristobal put the chances at 50-50 earlier this week. Johnson was expected to be one of Herbert\u2019s top targets this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The No. 15 Ducks may have that high-profile loss in the opener to Auburn but the good news is that they haven't dropped a Pac-12 game - unlike a pair of their northern rivals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
