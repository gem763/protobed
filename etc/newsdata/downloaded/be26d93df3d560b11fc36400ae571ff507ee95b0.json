the earliest stage- compared to just 26% at stage 4, the most advanced stage.\n\nBut, at present, only around 44% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at the earliest stage.\n\nIn the UK, screening programmes exist for breast, bowel and cervical cancers, when people reach a particular age.\n\nImage copyright Rafat Chowdhury Image caption Hyper-polarised MRI scans could be the future for diagnosing prostate cancer\n\nHowever, there are currently no reliable screening tools for other cancers, such as pancreas, liver, lung and prostate, which means survival rates are often much lower.\n\nProf Mark Emberton, from UCL, said the growth of imaging, such as MRI, was a \"silent revolution\" which could replace needles, used in biopsies, in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.\n\n\"Imaging only sees the aggressive cells, it overlooks the stuff you don't want to find and addresses over-diagnosis,\" he said, but he warned it was expensive and took time, and was \"not ready for prime time yet\".\n\nMore accurate hyper-polarised MRI scans and photo acoustics, where laser light is delivered to the tumour, creating sound waves which are analysed to produce images, are the next advances being tested in imaging.\n\nProf Emberton said the next goal was to see which cancers lent themselves to this type of imaging.\n\nAt the University of Cambridge, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald is developing an advanced endoscope to detect pre-cancerous lesions in the food pipe and colon.\n\nShe said early detection hadn't been given the attention it deserved, and some tests for cancer could be very simple and inexpensive.\n\nProf Fitzgerald said she looked forward to working with international colleagues to take ideas \"all the way from the bench to the bedside\".\n\nCancer Research UK is investing \u00a340m in the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection over the next five years, with $20m being contributed by Canary Center at Stanford University and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute in Oregon.", "description": "Cancer researchers from the UK and US are teaming up to search for the very earliest signs of cancer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7B82/production/_109281613_d9c24d44-90c1-4b50-87f3-585a7c693920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
