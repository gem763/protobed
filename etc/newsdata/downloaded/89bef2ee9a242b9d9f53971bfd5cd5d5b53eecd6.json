The paperwork is a summary of the votes from the four polls.\n\n\"Some people made human errors and did not send the tally to the returning office. And so the returning officer this morning and his staff are trying to contact these people who were in charge of these polls to get the tally,\" he said Tuesday morning.\n\nThe ballot boxes were sent back to the returning office, but Grenier says they are sealed and it's against the law to open ballot boxes, even to remove the second copy of the vote tally document that's stored inside.\n\nWhen vote counting was halted around 2 a.m. Tuesday, Liberal candidate Tim Louis was ahead of Conservative incumbent Harold Albrecht by 273 votes. There are 211 of 216 polls counted.\n\nThe close result is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for the riding, which saw Albrecht beat Louis by 251 votes in 2015.\n\nValidation of the vote\n\nDiane Benson, who also speaks for Elections Canada, said it's expected \"in the next few days, the returning officer will complete what's known as the validation of the vote. We should have more complete numbers then.\"\n\nEvery poll in Canada goes through a validation process that's set to begin at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Elections Canada website says a validation of the results of a vote is performed by the returning officer within the week after polling day.\n\n\"The returning officer validates the results in the presence of the assistant returning officer, and any candidates or their representatives or, if none are present, at least two electors,\" the website says.\n\nThat count is what is then referred to as the \"official result.\"\n\nIf after validation there is a tie, a byelection would be held.", "description": "Elections Canada says it appears a deputy returning officer, and possibly more than one, took home paperwork about the vote count of four polls in Kitchener-Conestoga that were supposed to be turned in to the returning officer.
