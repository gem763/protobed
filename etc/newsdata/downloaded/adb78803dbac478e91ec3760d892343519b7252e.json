These are global companies, and I don't want to transfer the leadership to Chinese companies,\" he added.\n\n\"But I do think we need a lot more transparency. We need to have privacy rights protected. We need to increase competition with things like data portability and interoperability.\"\n\nTwo months ago, the US Federal Trade Commission hit Facebook with a record $5 billion fine for data protection violations in a wide-ranging settlement that calls for revamping privacy controls and oversight at the social network.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter appeared before a Senate panel to answer questions on \"digital responsibility\" in the face of online violence and extremism.", "description": "Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg met Thursday with US President Donald Trump and members of Congress on a political reconnaissance mission to Washington, where he rejected calls to break up the world's biggest social network.
