Smaller emitters will be able to opt in to that program in order to avoid federal regulations.\n\nThe plants will be expected to reduce their emissions by 10 per cent below the benchmark the first year and one per cent every year after that. If they don't, they will have to pay $30 a tonne or buy emissions credits. Facilities under their benchmark will be allowed to stockpile or sell credits.\n\nSome of the money is to go into a fund to support greenhouse-gas-reducing technology. Half of every dollar raised after the first $100 million is to go to debt reduction or to the province's \"war room,\" a newly created $30-million office to counter criticism of the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe new plan deals with electricity generators the same way as one that was introduced by the New Democrats.\n\nPower plants \u2014 Alberta's largest emitters and where most emissions cuts are expected to occur \u2014 face different rules. They will be assigned a single benchmark for the entire industry.\n\nGovernment documents say the new approach could save industry up to $330 million a year.\n\nNixon said he expects the program to achieve about 32 megatonnes in greenhouse gas reductions. The New Democrat plan promised about 50 megatonnes, but that included a consumer carbon tax as well.\n\nTerry Abel of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers welcomed the new plan. \"The hybrid approach is probably the best way,\" he said. \"Each [emitter] is governed by unique circumstances.\"\n\nAbel also praised the focus on technology. He said industry is willing to do its part and just wants stable rules.\n\n\"We will always take and work with government to make any system work in the most efficient way possible.\"\n\nThe two-pronged approach is a mistake, say policy experts. Jan Gorski of the clean-energy think tank Pembina Institute said setting individual benchmarks is \"a step backwards.\"\n\n\"It's unfair and less efficient. It punishes companies that have had good performance that have already taken steps to reduce emissions and it rewards those that haven't.\n\n\"[The new system] is not as strong as the old system.\"\n\nNixon said individual benchmarks are necessary in industries that have to compete with other jurisdictions that may not have climate legislation.\n\n\"By going to [a hybrid system], we've been able to make adjustments to different industries.\"\n\nGorski points out that both British Columbia and the federal government use one benchmark for each sector.\n\nNixon said preliminary indications from federal officials suggest the new plan will meet Ottawa's requirements and stop the federal government from imposing its own backstop regulations for industrial emitters.\n\n\"At the civil servant level we've been in constant contact all the way through. We're fairly comfortable with our conversations with them, that we're at equivalency.\"\n\nThat decision will ultimately be made by the federal cabinet.\n\nOttawa requires carbon prices to increase $10 a year. No provision is made for that in the Alberta legislation and Nixon said that will be dealt with if and when it arises.", "description": "Alberta has introduced a new climate plan for the\u00a0province's big greenhouse gas emitters that it says will achieve\u00a0similar emissions cuts as the former NDP government's plan and at\u00a0less cost.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1048821.1379029346!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/li-suncor620-cp01321982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
