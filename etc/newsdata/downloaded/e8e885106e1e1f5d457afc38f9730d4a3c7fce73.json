If that happens, no one knows quite what the U.S. would do, including the U.S. itself. A 1979 American law suggests that the United States is committed to Taiwan\u2019s defense, but the law is ambiguous about just how committed.\n\nChina has been vastly improving its military capabilities, including its ability to strike aircraft carriers. I\u2019m told that in 18 of the last 18 Pentagon war games involving China in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. lost. Still, that can be misleading, because the war games are much more limited than real life would be. For example, the United States could interrupt China\u2019s oil supplies from the gulf.\n\nBeijing has also been nibbling away at Taiwan\u2019s international presence, blocking it from participating in the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies, and even barring Taiwanese from taking tours of the U.N. and Taiwanese journalists from getting U.N. accreditation.\n\nPresident Trump has generally been more supportive of Taiwan than his predecessors, and that\u2019s worked well so far. But this has to be done very carefully. While Taiwan and China may know each other\u2019s red lines, I worry that American politicians may try to help Taiwan in ways that increase the risk of triggering a crisis. Nothing can be so dangerous as a well-meaning American.\n\nAside from its efforts to isolate Taiwan, China also appears to be borrowing from the Russian playbook and using Facebook and other platforms to interfere with Taiwan\u2019s democracy in the run-up to crucial elections in January.\n\n\u201cChina is trying to discredit and dismantle Taiwan democracy,\u201d said Ketty Chen of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.", "description": "First, the lights in Taiwan go out.", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/opinion/04kristof2/04kristof2-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
