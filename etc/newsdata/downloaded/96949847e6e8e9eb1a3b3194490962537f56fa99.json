China has portrayed the protesters as violent separatists and bristled at what it calls 'foreign interference' in the matter.\n\nThe backlash in China against Morey's comments cast a cloud over the NBA's lucrative broadcasting, merchandising and sponsorship interests in the country, where it has legions of fans.\n\nThe NBA's operations in China have been valued at around $4 billion by Forbes.\n\nIn Toronto, pro-Hong Kong activists handed out black t-shirts bearing the slogan 'The North Stand with Hong Kong' ahead of the Raptors' opener against the Pelicans. ('The North' is often how Canadian basketball fans refer to themselves)\n\nA similar scene unfolded outside the Staples Center in California, where the Lakers and Clippers faced off in their much-anticipated opening game.\n\nA fan wears a t-shirt handed out by Hong Kong pro-democracy supporters\n\nA pro-Hong Kong activist holds an American flag as other activists (L) hold signs before the Los Angeles Lakers season opening game against the against the LA Clippers\n\nA pro-Hong Kong activist holds a poster of LeBron James with the words 'King of Chinese Money' before the Lakers opener, referring to James's vast business interests in the country\n\nActivists said they had produced around 10,000 t-shirts carrying the slogan 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong', which Morey had tweeted.\n\nAt one point a child was seen on Staples Center's scoreboard, but cameras quickly panned away when he revealed a 'Stand With Hong Kong' t-shirt\n\nThe t-shirt protest in Los Angeles was arranged by an activist using the pseudonym Sun Lared, who reportedly raised $43,000 through crowdfunding site GoFundMe to pay for the clothing.\n\nSeparately, the flag of Hong Kong was seen being waved behind television pundits outside the Staples Center during the TNT broadcast of the Lakers-Clippers game.\n\nFans from both Los Angeles teams voiced support for Hong Kong.\n\n'It's always tough to use sports as a political device to talk about, you know, politics,' Lakers fan Ray Campbell told AFP.\n\n'But sometimes it's necessary.'\n\nClippers fan Christian Macias added: 'Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong. I agree with it 100 percent, I feel like we are all humans and we all need to help each other.'\n\nProtesters in L.A. handed out t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 'Fight for Freedom'\n\n'The North' has become the way Canadian basketball fans refer to themselves\n\nOther protesters took aim at James.\n\nThe four-time MVP sparked controversy last week when he criticized Morey's tweet.\n\nOn Tuesday in Los Angeles, protesters could be seen holding posters of James with an altered hairline, similar to that of Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China.\n\nOther pictures showed him cropped onto the famous tank pictures from Tienanmen Square.\n\nThrough endorsement deals with Nike and other companies, James's business interests in China have become so vast that he's made an annual promotional trip to the country in each of the last 15 years.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal said Rockets executive Morey 'was right' in his remarks which ignited the furor.\n\n'Daryl Morey was right,' O'Neal said. 'Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say 'That's not right' and that's what he did.'\n\nActivists handed out 7000 t-shirts to those attending the game and encouraged them to wear the free shirts while in the stadium to protest China's censorship of NBA games after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morely posted a tweet supporting the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong\n\nA pro-Hong Kong activist argues with passersby before Tuesday's Raptors-Pelicans game\n\nO'Neal said nothing should inhibit free speech.\n\n'We as American people do a lot of business in China,' O'Neal said. 'They know and understand our values, and we understand their values.'\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver said last week China had demanded Morey be disciplined for his tweet, a claim later denied by Beijing.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver (pictured) said last week China had demanded Morey be disciplined for his tweet, a claim later denied by Beijing\n\n'The Chinese government never posed this requirement,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week.\n\nPreviously he stated that the NBA 'knows better than anyone else' how to go about repairing the relationship with the Chinese, though did not offer specifics.\n\nAlthough Silver has refused to discipline Morey or make any attempt to restrict free speech among players, coaches, or any team employees, the Commissioner has expressed his desire to continue doing business in China, even amid friction between the two countries. .\n\n'I understand there is a point of view from some that we shouldn't be in business at all in China, and I'd say from an intellectual standpoint, that's fair - not getting into whether the tweet or the response to it,' Silver said Thursday during an appearance at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York. 'But if people believe that we shouldn't be engaged in commerce in China or frankly in other places in the world ... I, at some point, look to the American government.\n\n'We're in the middle of negotiating a trade agreement,' Silver continued. 'Many multinational corporations do trade extensively with China. And if that's ultimately how our government feels we should be dealing with China, again, we are a U.S. company.'", "description": "China's state television blacked out the NBA's season-opening games  Wednesday in the latest fallout from  the league's dispute with Beijing.
