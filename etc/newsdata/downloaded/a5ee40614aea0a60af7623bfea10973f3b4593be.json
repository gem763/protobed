After making a return, a customer will have to either go for an upgrade, a downgrade, or a different model -- or they can walk away.\n\nThese and other recent price tweaks could help Tesla chase profitability, which the company has promised to achieve in the second half of 2019. But the changes could also drive away prospects who don't want to pay the higher prices, or cause some customers to delay purchases while they wait for the next batch of tweaks and incentives.\n\nFrost & Sullivan's Director of Aftersales, Retail & New Mobility Research, Kumar Saha, believes the company has little to lose in changing its prices and policies in this manner.\n\nHe explained, \"Tesla is building its brand and its manufacturing capabilities in front of everybody's eyes. They also want to torch the existing automotive retail practice and build it up in [CEO Elon] Musk's image. Musk loves to go ahead with anything that's disruptive and goes against the current of automotive retail. Since they are not beholden to dealerships and do not have to adhere to franchise laws like other automakers -- there's no reason why they have to follow a traditional path, either.\"", "description": "Tesla has quietly raised Model 3 prices, and made a number of tweaks to its ordering and returns process.
