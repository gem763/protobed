I went on Accutane three times. I was put on every medication that you could imagine to help my skin. Luckily, birth control was a savior for me when I was in my teens. And then when I was in my late 20s, I realized I wanted to detox my body of all medications.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s when everything happened -- the return to bad skin and, this time, weight gain. I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" she recalled. \"All people wanted to do was give me more medication. I don\u2019t shun people for needing or wanting to take medication, but for me, I knew something wasn\u2019t right. I just felt medication wasn\u2019t going to be the final cure.\"\n\nUltimately, a new doctor gave her a diagnosis of PCOS, which explained all her symptoms.\n\nDr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News' chief medical correspondent and a practicing OBGYN, told \"Good Morning America\" that the hormone abnormality, which affects one in 10 women, can cause reproductive issues, acne and excess body hair. Ashton also said that women with PCOS are five to seven times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, for reasons not entirely understood.\n\nAshton added it is crucial for women with PCOS to eat well and keep up with a fitness regimen, as well as keep their weight within a healthy range.\n\nMichele told the magazine that she grew up in a \"carb-heavy\" household, but is thankful that her mother \"kept a clean home.\" She also loves workouts \"with a spiritual element,\" such as SoulCycle and hot yoga.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t raised eating candy or processed food. I\u2019m very grateful that my parents raised me to have a healthy relationship with food,\" she said. \"Food was family. It was happiness; it was joy. I never looked at food as the enemy. But listen, I\u2019m a New Yorker, and it was definitely carb-heavy -- bagels and sandwiches. But I\u2019ve never really been a meat eater. Even as a child, I didn\u2019t like the idea of it.\"\n\nNow, Michele says she is \"the most mentally, physically, and spiritually sound that I\u2019ve ever been.\"\n\n\"Around 30, my metabolism changed, and I suddenly gained weight and felt out of control. That was a moment where I had to think, 'OK, I\u2019m older and things are not going to be the same as they were before.' So I took the time to listen to my body and figure out what it needed,\" she said. \"Now, I\u2019m 33 and so happy with my body. My husband thinks I\u2019m the most beautiful girl in the world, which is pretty great. But it\u2019s most about how I feel in my own skin -- and I feel truly great.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
