The vast majority of people have been lovely and really encouraging. I think for some it\u2019s a hard concept to get round. How you could lose your wife or husband and fall in love again?\"\n\n\"When that day happened the life I had, as a family, it might sound brutal, it ended. That line death us do part is in there for a reason. I know Gemma, for me and Ethan, would want us to find life again.\n\n\"She [Derrina] has been an incredible woman in loving me when I was broken and now rising up from the ashes.\n\n\"She knows no on on this planet could be Ethan\u2019s mum again but she\u2019s been a significant figure in his life. I love her to bits.\"\n\nSimon confessed it \"feels like yesterday\" that Gemma died yet also feels a long time ago in other ways.", "description": "A troll said Derrina was 'doing alright' out of the relationship with Simon after they enjoyed a plush spa break", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Simonjthomassky Instagram", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749861.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Simon-Thomas-girlfriend-hits-back-at-troll.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
