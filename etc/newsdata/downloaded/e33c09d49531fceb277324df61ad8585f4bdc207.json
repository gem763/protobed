It almost made it impossible not to pick at.\n\nThat protective layer wasn\u2019t meant to be removed, as it was an integral part to the Galaxy Fold\u2019s screen.But Samsung didn\u2019t make that clear enough. Some reviewers peeled the protective layer off the Galaxy Fold\u2019s screen, which resulted in malfunctioning screens.\n\nThe hinge isn\u2019t as bulky as the original version.\n\ncaption The original Galaxy Fold. source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe Galaxy Fold\u2019s hinge doesn\u2019t protrude outwards on the revised design, according to PCMag, and it sits flush against the rest of the phone\u2019s body when unfolded. It looks like the hinge becomes completely covered by the Fold\u2019s two halves when it\u2019s unfolded.\n\nThere\u2019s an extra layer of metal under the screen to make the screen more sturdy.\n\ncaption The original Galaxy Fold. source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThis extra layer of metal under the display makes the screen feel more sturdy, and prevents users from feeling the internals while you tap on the screen, according to Engadget.\n\nSome outlets say it\u2019s also meant to address the crease that ran along the Fold\u2019s screen, but some outlets say the crease is still there.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is easier to fold and unfold with an updated hinge mechanism.\n\ncaption The original Galaxy Fold. source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe updated hinge mechanism distributes the weight more evenly and feels sturdier, and it makes the Fold easier to fold and unfold, according to PCMag.\n\nThe gap between the two halves of the Galaxy Fold when folded is trimmed down from the original.\n\ncaption Marques Brownlee going through the original Galaxy Fold\u2019s features in an earlier video. source YouTube/MKBHD\n\nThere was a noticeable gap at the hinge between the two halves of the earlier Galaxy Fold when it was folded, but that gap has been reduced, according to The Verge.", "description": "Business Insider - Samsung made several changes and updates to the Galaxy Fold that directly address issues from the original version that caused serious problems..
