Following the broader roll-out the company hopes to expand to multi-currency transfers.\n\nThough Wells Fargo executives have been bullish on the potential for blockchain technology in financial services, the company has been more skeptical of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which launched the system into the spotlight.\n\nLast year, Wells Fargo joined U.S. rivals in banning the purchase of Bitcoin by credit-card customers, due to the volatility of the investment.\n\nBlockchain technology has attracted billions of dollars in investments from banks and other companies, but concerns about implementation and scalability has hindered many blockchain projects so far.\n\nEarly roadblocks have not stopped banks from experimenting aggressively in the space. In February, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) launched its own digital currency, also linked to the U.S. dollar, that allows its corporate clients to transfer funds instantly across its internal blockchain network.", "description": "Wells Fargo & Co said on Tuesday it will pilot its own digital currency powered by blockchain to help move cash across borders and between branches in real time.", "authors": ["Imani Moise", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430947577&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1M6", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
