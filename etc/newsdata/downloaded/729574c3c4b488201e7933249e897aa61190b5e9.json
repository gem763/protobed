Here are the key moments ahead:\n\nMonday\n\nThe Queen\u2019s speech, outlining the government\u2019s plans for legislation, will include details of the withdrawal agreement bill, to be voted on if the EU agrees to a Brexit deal this week. Among the other 22 bills are tougher sentences for violent and sexual offences and scrapping the current rail franchise system. The Scottish National party conference continues in Aberdeen.\n\nTuesday\n\nMPs debate the Queen\u2019s speech, which can take up to five days before a vote is held. The chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, will meet EU ministers before the European council summit on Thursday. Agenda papers say he will discuss the \u201cstate of play regarding Brexit\u201d.\n\nThursday\n\nThe EU summit begins in Brussels. Johnson and his team will attend, but it may already have become clear by that point whether a deal is doable. A fourth day of debate of the Queen\u2019s speech will he be held in the Commons.\n\nWith parliament not scheduled to sit on Friday, Thursday would be the government\u2019s last chance to table a motion scheduling a Saturday session in the House of Commons.\n\nFriday\n\nThe EU summit continues with Brexit talks, which is the last item on the agenda \u2013 and may turn its attention to the length of a potential extension.\n\nSaturday\n\nThe first time the Commons meets on a Saturday since the Falklands war has been labelled \u201csuper Saturday\u201d. Johnson will either present an EU-backed Brexit deal or set out his next steps.\n\nUnder the terms of the Benn act, Johnson should write a letter to the EU requesting an extension if parliament has not approved a Brexit deal by 11pm.\n\nIt is unclear whether the government will table the full withdrawal agreement implementation bill, which rebel MPs could seek to amend to bring about a referendum, or just a motion setting out the terms of the proposed deal.", "description": "Queen\u2019s speech, EU summit and a Saturday Commons session lie ahead for Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02aebe71df1cc277c0db24c863b8faffb23368cc/0_0_2257_1354/master/2257.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4859c0b1cc75c11ec1e7c988c056f066", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
