Trump\u2019s rise in the Republican Party was still something of a shock, and he wanted to know the things I felt he should keep in mind as he went about the task of covering Trump.\n\nAt the top of my list: Talk to psychologists and psychiatrists about the state of Trump\u2019s mental health, since I considered that to be the most important thing when it came to understanding him. It was Trump\u2019s Rosetta stone.\n\nI wasn\u2019t shy about making the same case publicly. During a July 14, 2016 appearance on C-SPAN\u2019s Washington Journal, for example, I responded to a pro-Trump caller who was upset that I opposed Trump despite my having been a Republican for my entire adult life and having served in the Reagan and George H.W. administrations and the George W. Bush White House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t oppose Mr. Trump because I think he\u2019s going to lose to Hillary Clinton,\u201d I told Ben from Purcellville, Virginia. \u201cI think he will, but as I said, he may well win. My opposition to him is based on something completely different, which is first, I think he is temperamentally unfit to be president. I think he\u2019s erratic, I think he\u2019s unprincipled, I think he\u2019s unstable, and I think that he has a personality disorder, I think he\u2019s obsessive. And at the end of the day having served in the White House for seven years in three administrations and worked for three presidents, one closely, and read a lot of history: I think the main requirement for president of the United States \u2026 is temperament, and disposition \u2026 whether you have wisdom and judgment and prudence.\u201d", "description": "Accepting the reality about the president\u2019s disordered personality is important\u2014even essential.", "authors": ["Peter Wehner", "Contributing Editor At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2PCAV/facebook.jpg?1567991054", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
