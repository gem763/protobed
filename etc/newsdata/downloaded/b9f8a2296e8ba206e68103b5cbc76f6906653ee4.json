REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File Photo\n\nAMS launched its 38.50 euro per share offer for the company earlier this month, beating a rival offer from private equity investors Bain Capital and Carlyle Group (CG.O) by 10%.\n\n\u201cOsram\u2019s executive board and the majority of its supervisory board recommend... that Osram shareholders accept the offer,\u201d the German group said in a statement.\n\nOsram had initially backed the finance investors\u2019 offer, who had agreed to maintain Osram as an independent company with its current management and to support its strategic direction.\n\nHowever, \u201cthe financial attractiveness of the (AMS) offer was to be weighted higher than points of criticism.\u201d\n\nAMS, best known for supplying Apple (AAPL.O) with sensors for its latest iPhones, wants to focus a combined business strongly on the auto industry and supply manufacturers with sensors and lighting solutions for self-driving cars.\n\nAMS said on Monday that feedback from investors on a global roadshow had been positive.\n\n\u201cBased on extensive interaction with investors in Europe, the U.S. and Asia, AMS sees strong support for its strategic vision including Osram, which is reinforcing AMS\u2019 conviction for the offer,\u201d the Austrian group said. Capitalising on the positive momentum, it would lower the acceptance threshold of its offer to 62.5% from the previous 70%.\n\nThe biggest Osram shareholders AMS aims to convince are Allianz Global Investors (ALVG.DE) with 9.4% of the stock, UBS (UBSG.S) with 6.2% and Barclays (BARC.L) with 5.5%, according to latest filings.\n\nOsram\u2019s supervisory board decision to recommend AMS\u2019s offer was not unanimous. Employee representatives fear that AMS could break up the company. Osram\u2019s management and supervisory board are worried about the long-term business prospects.\n\nAMS has to take on billions of debt to finance the takeover, and Osram said paying off the funds could become difficult. AMS depended largely on a group of key customers, and that entailed the risk \u201cthat the financial situation of the combined group may become very strained\u201d if key customers switched to other technological solutions or place less orders.\n\nOsram also voiced doubts whether the Austrian sensor specialist, whose number of staff is about a third of that of the German group, will be able to stem such a complex takeover.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that AMS may not be able to successfully organise the integration and to realise at the same time the publicly announced synergies in the intended short period of time,\u201d it said.", "description": "German lighting group Osram advised its shareholders on Monday to accept a 4.3 billion euro (\u00a33.8 billion) takeover bid from AMS and sell their shares to the Austrian sensor specialist, saying the offer was economically attractive.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430360103&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0DV", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
