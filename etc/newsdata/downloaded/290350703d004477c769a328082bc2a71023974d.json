Rather than Blair\u2019s A Journey, this one is called For the Record \u2013 in other words, I Have Been Traduced: Here Is the Truth, with a possible subtitle, I Told You I\u2019d Be Good At It (And I Was, Apart From the Part That Didn\u2019t Work Out). Whereas Blair\u2019s was a story of learning, discovery and change, Cameron was surer of who he was and his right to be in No 10.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCameron writes of feeling \u201cstrangely at ease\u201d when he became prime minister \u2013 \u201cnot at ease in an entitled, born-to-rule sense, but because there is such a warmth from all the people in that building\u201d. It\u2019s an unconvincing line, because the next sentence is about his \u201cfamiliarity\u201d with No 10, where he worked as a special adviser in his twenties.\n\nBut in one respect, the books are the same: they each set out to defend their author against the one charge for which history will remember him. With Blair, it\u2019s taking the country to war in Iraq; with Cameron, it\u2019s holding the referendum on Europe for reasons of party management and then running away when it all went wrong.\n\nCameron makes his case with style. The book is easy to read, with some nice self-deprecating touches. He says some of his achievements happened \u201cbecause I got a bee in my bonnet about an issue and got the bit between my teeth (and like most modern politicians, mixed my metaphors along the way)\u201d.\n\nThe narrative is kept alive by dry humour. The opening chapter is about the negotiations that followed the inconclusive election in 2010. He consulted former Tory leaders John Major, Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith about a coalition with the Lib Dems. He also phoned his sometime leadership rivals Liam Fox, Ken Clarke and David Davis. \u201cDavis thinks it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d he reported to his team. \u201cWhich means I\u2019m probably on the right track.\u201d\n\nThe part of autobiographies that I usually find most interesting is the early life, because that\u2019s the side of the person that we know less about, and all families, even happy ones, are strange and unexpected. But Cameron\u2019s prehistory is short: just six pages about his early childhood, four pages about Eton, and seven about Oxford. Just another 670 pages to go.\n\nHis early life is in any case well known. Most striking for me was his account of his journey through Russia on the Trans-Siberian railway in his gap year, and his formation as a conventional Thatcherite: \u201cFrom that train ride onwards I was never in any doubt that in the battle between the democratic, capitalist west and the communist, state-controlled east, we were on the right side.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Cameron announced his resignation after Britain voted to leave the European Union after a bitterly divisive referendum campaign AP\n\nThen he plunges straight into his political career, at Conservative head office and then as a special adviser to chancellor Norman Lamont. And at the outset, the ending is foretold. In 1992, he wrote a pamphlet in Lamont\u2019s name, opposing the idea of a European superstate. It declared: \u201cNo one would die for the EU.\u201d Cameron comments: \u201cNo 10 asked us to take it out. We kept it in.\u201d\n\nHe is surprisingly frank about Lamont\u2019s attempt to increase VAT on heating bills. \u201cThis was a mistake; and in many ways it was my mistake.\u201d It was defeated in the House of Commons in a great victory for John Smith, the Labour leader. Cameron is rueful about his failure to learn the lesson: \u201cNot for the last time in my political career, I had failed to spot the essential political equation: rational case versus emotional argument equals political disaster.\u201d\n\nBut the bulk of the book is devoted to the steady ascent to the triumphant 2015 election. The peak was his speech to the Tory party conference that year, after watching in disbelief as Labour elected Jeremy Corbyn its leader. \u201cI felt that I had everything on my side: experience and energy, plus my party and my country. I find it hard to write about that now, because it makes me so sad to think about what might have been.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the story ends with three short chapters, \u201cRenegotiation\u201d, \u201cReferendum\u201d and \u201cThe End\u201d. Cameron recounts the tortured negotiations with Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, trying and failing to keep them on the Remain side. He was \u201crepeatedly surprised\u201d by people at all levels of the party coming out for Leave. He canvassed each member of his cabinet. \u201cAll these conversations were far harder than I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nHe says he made mistakes and that the margin \u2013 \u201conly\u201d 600,000 votes \u2013 was such that \u201cif I had done something differently the result could have been different\u201d. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true.\n\nThe only thing that might have made a difference, I think, is if Johnson had been persuaded the other way. Without him \u2013 \u201cthe only leading politician whose favourability rating was higher than mine\u201d, Cameron notes \u2013 the Leave campaign would have lacked credibility.\n\nAs it is, Cameron is generous with his blame. He blames the government\u2019s lawyers for \u201cwatering down\u201d a bill, drafted in an attempt to allay Johnson\u2019s misgivings, that would have made the British Supreme Court \u201cthe final arbiter of the application of EU law in the UK\u201d.\n\nHe blames the Daily Mail \u2013 \u201cit has been reported\u201d, he writes, that he asked Lord Rothermere, the Mail\u2019s owner, to sack Paul Dacre, its editor, and \u201cfrankly, I wish I had\u201d. He blames the BBC, for treating the economic claims of the Leave campaign as equivalent to those of Remain. (It is an iron law that all prime ministers fall out with the BBC.) And he blames the anti-establishment sentiment that swept across much of the world after the financial crisis.\n\nHe also writes of the irony of his government\u2019s \u201crescue\u201d of the economy, which \u201csparked a jobs boom which attracted record migration to the UK. Our successes really do hold the seeds of our defeat.\u201d\n\nAll of this, though, is self-aggrandising. It implies that, if only he had done things differently, or persuaded others to do things differently, he would have won. Just as Tony Blair tends to imply that Iraq was his decision alone, and to overlook the reality, which was that the Americans were going ahead with the invasion whatever the British government and parliament decided.\n\nRight at the end of his book, Cameron\u2019s argument switches to one of inevitability. He rejects the idea that he promised the referendum simply to hold his party together. As he says, there was \u201cbroad support\u201d for the idea of a referendum, \u201cwhich found expression in the result\u201d. The Conservatives were divided, and Ukip was threatening to steal its voters precisely because people were hostile to EU membership. He says: \u201cIt is odd to argue that because a majority decided they didn\u2019t want to be in the EU, this proves we should have stayed in without asking.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t make much of this argument, possibly because it diminishes his role: he simply tried to manage the irresistible forces that were pushing the country towards a referendum \u2013 and towards a likely decision to leave. He tried to control those forces by holding the vote on his own terms, and it could be argued that Remain did well to win as much as 48 per cent of the vote.\n\nCameron cites support from a surprising source \u2013 a letter John Major wrote to him in the days after he left office: \u201cHistory will acknowledge that a referendum was becoming inevitable \u2013 if not now, later \u2013 and delay would have made Brexit more likely.\u201d\n\nI think this is the right reading of history. But as with Blair and Iraq, Cameron, ultimately, has almost no chance of persuading most people that he acted in the national interest.\n\nFor the Record, by David Cameron.
