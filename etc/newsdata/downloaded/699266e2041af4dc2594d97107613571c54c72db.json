Here\u2019s how the broad indexes fared for those three months and the first three quarters of 2019, along with long-term returns:\n\nIndex Total return: third quarter, 2019 Total return: 2019, through Sept. 30 Total return: 3 years Total return: 5 years Total return: 10 years Total return: 15 years Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.2% 15.4% 47.0% 60.2% 183.1% 164.1% S&P 500 1.7% 20.6% 45.8% 67.3% 246.7% 264.7% S&P 400 Mid Cap Index -0.1% 17.9% 30.9% 53.0% 226.5% 307.5% S&P Small Cap 600 Index -0.2% 13.5% 30.7% 60.2% 240.1% 291.1% Nasdaq Composite Index 0.2% 0.2% 55.6% 88.4% 322.2% 391.3% Nasdaq-100 Index 1.3% 23.4% 64.3% 102.8% 404.9% 530.1% Source: FactSet\n\nThe financial media and many professional investors agree that we are at a late stage for the bull market that (arguably) started at the post-financial-crisis bottom on March 9, 2009.\n\nOne sign of a frothy market is the seemingly new perception that assumptions about valuations for certain startup companies have been fantastic. The WeWork fiasco \u2014 leading to the ouster, sort of, of co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann \u2014 is a telling example. Another is Endeavor\u2019s second failure this year to take itself public. Peloton PTON, -10.32% actually made it to market, but the shares started trading on Sept. 26 at $27, two dollars below its initial offering price.\n\nThen again, the world remains awash with cash as central banks in the developed world continue to be extraordinarily accommodative as they attempt to stave off possible recessions. Bonds with negative yields to maturity total more than $17 trillion, according to Bloomberg. That and the 1.74% yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.90% make the 1.98% dividend yield for the S&P 500 attractive.\n\nSo we cannot predict when this bull market will end.\n\nHere\u2019s how the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 have performed:\n\nS&P 500 sector Total return: third quarter, 2019 Total return: 2019, through Sept. 30 Total return: 3 years Total return: 5 years Total return: 10 years Total return: 15 years Utilities 9.3% 25.4% 47% 83% 225% 356% Real Estate 7.7% 29.7% 34% 73% 295% 296% Consumer Staples 6.1% 23.3% 26% 56% 219% 330% Information Technology 3.3% 31.4% 84% 131% 385% 483% Communications Services 2.2% 21.7% 10% 29% 148% 173% Financials 2.0% 19.6% 54% 65% 178% 68% Industrials 1.0% 22.6% 38% 59% 253% 247% Consumer Discretionary 0.5% 22.5% 55% 93% 409% 380% Materials -0.1% 17.1% 30% 30% 142% 199% Health Care -2.2% 5.6% 32% 53% 278% 313% Energy -6.3% 6.0% -8% -23% 39% 124% Source: FactSet\n\nWith interest rates declining dramatically during the third quarter as the Federal Reserve reversed course, it may not be a surprise to see that the utilities sector (with its generally high dividend yields) performed best during the third quarter. But look at the 15-year returns \u2014 the utilities sector ranks third.\n\nThe Dow 30\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s how all 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.28% have performed this year and during the third quarter, along with some information about analysts\u2019 opinions of the stocks. All total returns include reinvested dividends:\n\nYou can click on the tickers for more about each company.\n\nThe \u201cnew\u201d Dow Inc. DOW, -3.53% has no year-to-date total return. The stock is down 1% (with reinvested dividends) since it began trading separately from the temporarily combined DowDuPont on March 20.\n\nS&P 500\n\nHere are this year\u2019s 10 best performers among the S&P 500 SPX, -1.23% :\n\nAnd here are the 10 worst performers among the S&P 500:\n\nS&P Mid-Cap\n\nHere are the best performing components of the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, -1.83% this year:\n\nAnd the worst 10:\n\nS&P Small-Cap\n\nHere are the 10 best-performing components of the S&P Small-Cap 600 Index SML, -1.95% so far in 2019:\n\nAnd the 10 worst performers:\n\nNasdaq-100\n\nHere are the 10 best performers this year among components of the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX, -0.84% :\n\nAnd the 10 worst performers:\n\nDon\u2019t miss: These bank stocks could be crushed if the Fed keeps lowering interest rates\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "Here\u2019s a review of winners and losers for multiple indexes, including small-cap and mid-cap.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS373_Chip_2_ZG_20191001081818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
