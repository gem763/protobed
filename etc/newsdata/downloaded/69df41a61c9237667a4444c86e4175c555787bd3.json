Turkey launched the operation into northern Syria on Oct. 9, declaring that it aimed to push out Syrian Kurdish fighters it considers terrorists and an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.\n\nIRAQ'S MILITARY SAYS US TROOPS LEAVING SYRIA DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY\n\nThe U.S. then brokered a deal last week for a 120-hour pause in fighting that expires Tuesday night, to allow Syrian Kurdish fighters to leave areas Turkey controls\n\nTurkey seeks to establish what it calls a \"safe zone\" extending more than 250 miles along the Turkish-Syrian border and about 19 miles inside Syria, where it plans to resettle about 2 million of the roughly 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey.\n\n\"If America does not keep to its promises, our offensive will continue from where it left off, with a much greater determination,\" Erdogan said Tuesday. \"There is no place for the (Kurdish fighters) in Syria's future. We hope that with Russia's cooperation, we will rid the region of separatist terror.\"\n\nAMERICAN TROOPS LEAVING SYRIAN CITY CONTROLLED BY KURDS PELTED WITH POTATOES, TOMATOES\n\nAlthough Turkish officials say the cease-fire agreement specifically covers a roughly 75-mile stretch between the Syrian border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, Erdogan has made clear he wants Turkish military presence along the full stretch of the border from the Euphrates River to Syria's border with Iraq.\n\nTurkey's military said Tuesday at least 136 vehicles, carrying fighters, had left the region. It said it had recorded a total of 41 violations since the cease-fire came into effect. Kurdish officials have also accused Turkey of cease-fire violations.\n\nTurkey's incursion into Syria has led to an international outcry, which has, in turn, enraged Erdogan, who has accused his NATO allies of not standing by Turkey.\n\nKURDISH MILITARY LEADER SAYS HIS FIGHTERS STILL WANT TO WORK WITH AMERICA\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk on Tuesday condemned the incursion and called on Erdogan to pull his troops out of the region.\n\nTusk, speaking to EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, said \"no one is fooled by the so-called cease-fire\" agreement, and that Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership, \"needs to end its military action permanently, withdraw its forces and respect international humanitarian law.\"\n\nHe added that \"any other course means unacceptable suffering, a victory for Daesh (the Islamic State group), and a serious threat to European security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEmbattled Syrian President Bashar Assad also visited territory captured from Turkey-backed Syrian fighters in the northwestern province of Idlib on Tuesday, where he described Erdogan as a \"thief.\"\n\nState media showed images of Assad standing among Syrian soldiers in what the report said was strategic southern Idlib territory. The media quoted Assad as calling Erdogan a \"thief who robbed factories, wheat, and fuel and is today stealing territory\" \u2014 apparently referring to Turkey's invasion this month into northeastern Syria.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is holding last-minute talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin Tuesday as the clock is winding down on a cease-fire deal between Turkish and Kurdish forces.", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/erdogan-putin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
