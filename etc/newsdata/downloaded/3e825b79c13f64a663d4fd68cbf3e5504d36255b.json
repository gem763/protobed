But he has banned North from copying her mom\n\n'North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,' the 39-year-old old E! News at the debut of her KKW Beauty at an Ulta Beauty store in New York on Thursday.\n\n'It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best.\n\n'I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.'\n\nThe rapper first put his foot down to block North's growing interest in make-up last month, having previously allowed North to wear cosmetics many times.\n\nKim and Kanye's eldest child has been pictured on multiple occasions testing a variety of makeup trends, including bright orange eyeshadow and red lipstick.\n\nFor the Kardashian Christmas Eve party last year, which was hosted at the West household, North proudly puckered her lips for the camera while rocking a bold lipstick shade.\n\n'I think he had it [with North's make-up so] he changed all the rules,' Kim told E! when Kanye first made the decision to stop wearing beauty products.\n\nWith full glam, Kim style: North was seen with dark lipstick when she attended Kanye's church service in March\n\nShe loves to experiment with paint: The eldest child of Kim and Kanye has often been seen with makeup on\n\nThe new North: Here the child is seen with no makeup on and conservative clothes in Armenia this month with mom Kim\n\n'I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip.'\n\nAnd it doesn't help that Auntie Kylie Jenner gives North all of the enticing lip kits from her eponymous beauty brand, which has helped to make the 22-year-old a billionaire.\n\n'I kind of got in trouble for that, too. So, it's now no more makeup,' Kim added.\n\nKanye also has new rules about North's clothes.\n\nHe revealed on Apple Music's Beats 1 that when North was young he wanted her to look like a pop star.\n\nHe said: 'I was literally out there making [North] try to out dress Rihanna.'\n\nAnd he regrets it: 'I don't think North should wear a crop top after I had her wear a slip dress when she was two years old. I think and feel differently now that I am Christian.'\n\nKim and Kanye also share sons Saint, three, Chicago, 21 months, and five-months-old Psalm.\n\nMommy sells makeup for a living: Here Mrs Kanye West is seen at the KKW Beauty launch at ULTA Beauty on Thursday in New York City\n\nRegret: West admits he used to want North (seen left in 2016) to 'out dress Rihanna' but now regrets putting her in slip dresses and crop tops. Rihanna is pictured right in 2015\n\nKanye, a reformed porn addict, has also urged his wife to tone down her sexy looks, much to the chagrin of fans and feminists.\n\nThe rapper didn't approve of the low-cut Thierry Mugler dress she wore to the Met Gala earlier this year, and he wanted her to wear something more conservative.\n\nIn scenes shown on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, he said: 'The corset, underwear, all of that vibe, I just feel like I just went through this transition where, from being a rapper, like, looking at all these girls, and looking at my wife, like, \"Oh, my girl needs to be just like the other girls, showing her body off, showing this, showing that.\n\n'And I didn't realize that that was affecting, like, my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of, like, now what about to be four kids.\n\n'A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?'\n\nHowever, the reality star fired back and told her man she didn't need the 'negative energy' of his disapproval.\n\nShe argued: 'You knew last night I was having really bad anxiety, and I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me wearing a tight dress.'\n\n'Too sexy': Kanye didn't approve of the low-cut Thierry Mugler dress she was planning to wear to the Met Gala. The couple argued over his views during a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians\n\nKanye then insisted it 'affects' him when his partner poses for 'sexy' photos.\n\nHe added: 'You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.'\n\nHowever, Kim pointed out her husband was the reason she felt confident and sexy, while insisting they were now in different places when it comes to their attitudes.\n\nShe explained: 'You built me up to be, like, this sexy person and confident and all this stuff. And just because you're on a journey, and you're on your transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you.'\n\nInterestingly, Kim's younger sister and fellow beauty businesswoman Kylie has also spoken out about when she will allow her own daughter, Stormi, to play with make-up products, revealing earlier this month that the 18-month-old is already 'super into' cosmetics.\n\nIn a make-up tutorial video posted to her YouTube channel, Kylie revealed that Stormi 'begs' to wear make-up and is already 'obsessed' with it.\n\n'Stormi is actually super into make-up right now. It's amazing,' she explained. 'Every time I'm wearing lipstick she notices. She looks at me and says, \"Lip lip lip.\"'\n\nHowever, Kylie continued to explain that as a first-time mother she wasn't yet sure when she'd officially allow Stormi to wear make-up.\n\n'I haven't even thought about when I'm gonna let Stormi wear make-up. I don't know, I'm just going to see,' she continued.\n\n'She might even not want to wear make-up. But honestly, how things are going, this girl is obsessed with make-up. She begs me at this point.'", "description": "Kanye West has banned his six-year-old daughter North from wearing make-up and crop tops after becoming a 'born again' Christian.", "authors": ["Bobbie Whiteman For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20192246-0-image-a-31_1572027333943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
