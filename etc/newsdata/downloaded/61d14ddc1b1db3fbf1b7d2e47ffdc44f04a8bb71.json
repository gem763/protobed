REUTERS/Kate Munsch\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Adam Neumann\u2019s reign at WeWork is over \u2013 with a reward for failure. The office-sharing firm\u2019s board has chosen a nearly $10 billion rescue package from existing backer SoftBank, valuing the business 83% below its $47 billion peak, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Whether that\u2019s enough for WeWork parent The We Company to build a profitable foundation won\u2019t be apparent for some time. Investors can, however, ensure Neumann is the last founder able to run amok.\n\nSoftBank is buying $1 billion of shares from Neumann, lending him $500 million to repay a loan from JPMorgan, and handing him a so-called consulting fee of $185 million. In effect that\u2019s paying him to go away, buying out the voting control which he commanded despite owning only a minority stake.\n\nThat will grate with other investors and employees. Neumann was, after all, responsible for the near-demise of WeWork as well as its meteoric ascent. Supporters initially signed up to his mumbo jumbo, like wanting to \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness.\u201d But the lack of focus on what amounts to a real-estate business soured the market on the company\u2019s planned initial public offering, which had to be abandoned.\n\nConflicts of interest abounded, too. These ranged from Neumann owning properties that were leased to WeWork to his receiving $5.9 million in payment for trademarks \u2013 an amount he had to give back as advisers tried to rescue the IPO. Meanwhile the company was incinerating cash \u2013 $2.2 billion last year, more than its revenue.\n\nThe scrutiny the IPO process brought to The We Company\u2019s inner workings has prevented public-market shareholders from becoming stuck in the morass. SoftBank, though, is stumping almost as much again as it had already injected into WeWork. That ought to be a lesson to investors with their own grand visions.\n\nAnother lesson is the danger of allowing anyone unchecked power over outside investors\u2019 money. Neither SoftBank nor earlier WeWork supporters like Benchmark Capital can blame anyone but themselves for that. Charismatic tech founders such as Neumann are treated like deities, but they aren\u2019t always the right people to run a big organization \u2013 Benchmark, for one, should have learned that from Travis Kalanick at Uber Technologies. It\u2019s past time to end the cult of the founder.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Adam Neumann\u2019s reign at WeWork is over \u2013 with a reward for failure.
