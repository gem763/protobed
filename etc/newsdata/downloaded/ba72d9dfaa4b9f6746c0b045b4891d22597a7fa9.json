Instead, it sends them into a \u201cviable but non-culturable state\u201d, which means they are not picked up in standard tests, which take a sample of the food and try to culture any germs on it.\n\nThe presence of the pathogens is thus masked by the bleach, but they are still dangerous to human health.\n\nErik Millstone, professor of science policy at Sussex University and co-author of the briefing, told the Guardian lives would be at stake if food based on these lower standards were sold in the UK. \u201cI am satisfied [by the evidence] that US food poisoning cases are significantly higher than in the UK. A minority of people suffer fatal complications,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will certainly be fatalities, and they typically affect vulnerable people, such as infants, small children and the elderly.\u201d\n\nHe said a no-deal Brexit would increase the pressure for the UK to accept food from abroad produced to US standards, especially if shortages raised prices, and warned that current laws on labelling were inadequate.\n\nTim Lang, professor of food policy at City Universityand also a co-author, said the government was \u201cwriggling\u201d over the definitions of safety. \u201cFor the chief scientist at Defra to say what he did is not accidental,\u201d he said.\n\nRobert Wood Johnson, the US ambassador, responded to the Guardian: \u201cSir Ian Boyd is absolutely right: American food safety standards are second to none. The EU\u2019s scientists have said antimicrobial washes are the most effective and economical way to deal with potentially lethal bacteria like salmonella and campylobacter. The World Health Organisation found North America has the lowest incidence of foodborne illness anywhere in the world. A comprehensive free-trade agreement that includes agriculture will create more opportunity, greater choices and wider prosperity for both British and American farmers and consumers.\u201d\n\nHis clear signal that agriculture should be part of a trade deal faces ministers with difficult choices. Farmers fear being undercut by lower-standard imports, while supermarkets are concerned that they will be blamed over any future food safety scares.\n\nMinette Batters, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, told the Guardian: \u201cEven if we leave the EU with a deal, there is a very real risk that we will have to compete with food imports that have been produced using methods and products that would be illegal on British farms. We need a clear commitment from government that it will set up a trade and standards commission to provide certainty for both farmers and the British public that our values of food production will be respected post-Brexit.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Defra stopped short of an explicit commitment on chlorinated chicken, or that EU standards would be maintained: \u201cWe have been clear that any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies. Without exception, imports will meet our stringent food safety standards. After EU exit, the UK will decide how we set and maintain our own standards and regulations.\u201d\n\nGareth Morgan, head of farming and land use policy at the Soil Association, warned that consumers would face issues beyond food safety: \u201cThe notion that chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef are \u201csafe\u201d misses the point. These practices prop up inherently unsafe industrial farming systems with terrible welfare standards.\u201d", "description": "Government\u2019s assurances that there are no health problems are misleading, say food policy experts", "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fe4b365fa53b7c435cd14d882365c99c308cf8/0_211_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e1adc5222060fdd60fbb075c35c30fe", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
