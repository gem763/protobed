I occasionally went for a run with a second-hand sports watch and chest strap to monitor my heart rate but very quickly grew tired of multiple gadgets. I soon after succumbed to the Fitbit Charge 2: a device that would benefit my mental as well as physical health.\n\nI did a little research before committing to the Charge 2 but had very basic needs \u2013 a watch which measured heart rate, steps and calories burned through exercises. And even though my main focus was fitness, I still wanted a tracker I could wear all day that wouldn\u2019t feel bulky or impede my typing. Thankfully, this Fitbit offers all these features and also includes a bonus sleep tracking functionality. It\u2019s simple to set up and when the Charge 2 arrived I had it charged up and fully operational within an hour. The tracker includes optional phone, calendar and email alerts but when I\u2019m exercising I prefer to be free from distraction so turn these notifications off.\n\nAs I spend most of my working day desk-bound, sometimes I need to be reminded to get up and move around and the Charge 2 offers this capability. I get hourly \u201creminders to move\u201d between 9am and 5pm, a little buzz alerting me that I haven\u2019t moved at least 250 steps within the hour. At the weekend I tend to work out in the morning and disable any reminders to enjoy some rest.\n\nMy increased interest in fitness coincided with a period of anxiety and through my Fitbit I was able to see the physical manifestation of this anxiety. I saw that my rapid heart rate though moments of panic was real, not imagined and was able to track my disturbed sleep patterns through the app. I hadn\u2019t read up on all the Fitbit features and when I discovered the \u201crelax\u201d function I thought I\u2019d give it a try. You are given a two or five-minute guided meditation with breathing exercises to encourage your heart rate to decrease as you follow the instructions on the watch face. From my first relaxation session, I was hooked and committed to spending at least 5 minutes a day focusing on my breath.\n\nIt\u2019s strange that the very thing I bought the tracker for \u2013 to track my physical fitness stats \u2013 became insignificant once I decided to focus on my mental fitness. I became less impressed by steps and calories and worked on improving my sleep and breathing patterns. The impact on my anxiety has been so significant (I\u2019m such a Fitbit evangelist) that three generations of my family now own the same model and we regularly engage in geeky chats about our sleep or step stats.\n\nI have my eye on the Fitbit Charge 3 - a waterproof upgrade that can be worn while swimming but loathe to give up on my trusty Charge 2 just yet. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
