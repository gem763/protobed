They started with images. After all, people wanted more than just text.\n\n\"This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world's attention. At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen.\n\n\"But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: JLo wearing that dress.
