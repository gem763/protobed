Riverside cherry trees bursting into cloudlike bloom. Zen gardens with raked sand and haiku-inspiring rock formations. There are perhaps few more evocative city names than \u201cKyoto\u201d.

Kyoto was spared the wartime bombings that blitzed the capital and today is still home to 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines.", "description": "Continuing our series, Danielle Demetriou explains how to tackle Kyoto, Japan's ancient and imperial capital.", "authors": ["Danielle Demetriou", "Destination Expert"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/February/kyoto-temple-iStock-511063730-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-03-04"}
