Domestic banks with under $700 billion in assets, which includes all but a handful of the nation's largest firms, would enjoy some degree of relaxed capital and liquidity rules.\n\nFed staff estimated the final rules would lower capital requirements by about 0.6% and liquidity requirements would drop by about 2% for all affected banks.\n\nGlobally systemically important U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N: ), Bank of America Corp (N: ), Citigroup Inc (N: ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ) and Morgan Stanley (N: ) would not benefit from the changes however.\n\nOn Thursday the Fed also finalized a new regulatory regime for foreign banks operating in the United States. The rules relax capital, liquidity and stress testing requirements for subsidiaries of foreign banks but retain stricter standards for firms that engage in riskier activities like short-term funding.\n\nThursday's rules package also includes a relaxed schedule for when foreign and domestic banks must submit \"living wills\" to the regulator detailing how they could be safely dissolved.", "description": "Fed finalizes post-crisis rule easing for domestic, foreign banks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF991WD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
