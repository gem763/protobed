In the process of using his Twitter account to retweet official Hurricane Dorian forecasts from the National Hurricane Center, Trump incorrectly stated on Sunday that the storm could hit Alabama.\n\nDespite being corrected within 20 minutes by the National Weather Service, Trump went on to lash out repeatedly against journalists who reported on his false claim, defending himself via outdated maps, video manipulation, and even with a six-day-old map that he had been altered with a Sharpie marker.\n\nHere's how Trump's confusion over Alabama and Hurricane Dorian's trajectory originated, and a timeline of what has happened since, as he continues to double down on his misstatement and attack the news media.\n\nRead more: Trump may have broken federal law by altering Hurricane Dorian's path on a map to validate his false claim that it could hit Alabama\n\nFriday, August 30:\n\nNOAA\n\nOn August 30, the NHC tweeted out a forecast of Hurricane Dorian's trajectory toward the US, based on information and data available at that time. The possible path showed the storm making landfall over Florida, with the potential affected area reaching into Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1167541994819731456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\n5 PM EDT: Here are the latest Key Messages for #Dorian.

Per photos uploaded to the White House Flickr account, this map was used in an early briefing in the Oval Office.\n\nLater, Trump would use other maps that were not issued by the NHC to defend his claim that the hurricane could have hit Alabama.\n\nForecasts display estimated paths of weather patterns, so there is always a degree of uncertainty leading up to a storm's approach \u2013 but there was never a statistically significant chance that Dorian would actually \"hit\" Alabama, as the president would go on to tweet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, August 31:\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1167725285065641984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nHere are the 5 AM EDT Saturday, August 31 Key Messages for Hurricane #Dorian. A prolonged period of storm surge and hurricane-force winds are likely over portions of the northwestern Bahamas.

Rather, the entire forecast shifted north, steering clear of Alabama even more than earlier forecasts.\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1167767214109278210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\n8/31 8 AM EDT: There's been a notable change overnight to the forecast of #Dorian after Tuesday. It should be stressed that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty pic.twitter.com/GSds0bKunM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, Sept. 1:\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1168174613827899393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.
