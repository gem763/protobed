(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than 100 people packed into a public hearing in Chevy Chase Village Monday to debate what one board member called \u201cthe most contentious and emotionally-charged issue\u201d in the community\u2019s history: the barking of dogs.\n\nThe board voted 5-2 in favor of disestablishing the dog park that has divided this Maryland suburb for months, turning it into just a park.\n\n\u201cThe size and location of this off-leash area is not meeting standards,\u201d board chairwoman Elissa Leonard said before a chorus of boos from dozens of dog-lovers who wore matching white hats to show their support of the park.\n\n\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourselves!\u201d a member of the crowd yelled before leading a mass exodus from the meeting.\n\nThe decision put an end to months of howling from the humans in this wealthy enclave just outside Washington. What began as a plan to turn a patch of land frequented by local pups into a formal dog park became a breeding ground for animal animus.\n\n[A Chevy Chase dog park divides the rich and powerful]\n\n\n\nBoard members take a vote before turning their attention to the dog park. (Jessica Contrera/The Washington Post)\n\nNeighbors who live directly beside the park complained that they found their lives disrupted by the barking dogs, the carelessness of their companions and the nuisance of outsiders\u2019 cars parked in front of their homes.\n\nThe tension escalated when The Washington Post published a story about the divisions, chronicling the powerful players embroiled in the debate: Leonard, the wife of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; Doug Gansler, the former attorney general of Maryland, loads of lawyers, and Chubbs, a 5-month old golden retriever.\n\nWhile Chubbs has been rolling in his newfound fame (dog sitters on Rover.com reached out to his parents to ask whether he was the Chubbs), neighbors who opposed the dog park found themselves being threatened by anonymous commenters online. They said strangers have driven past their houses to beep, yell and create even more noise.\n\nDog owners shared the address of the park on Reddit to encourage people with particularly vociferous pooches to visit. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) brought his 3-year-old Siberian husky, Toby, to the park to sniff out the situation. The president of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, better known as PETA, sent a letter reminding the board that dog parks are the \u201ccanine version of a human happy hour.\u201d\n\nBy the time the board convened Monday to make its decision about the park\u2019s fate, it had received more than 110 pages of letters filled with extensive bulleted lists, references to research journals and analyses of canine bowel movements.\n\n\n\nResidents line up to have their say about the dog park Monday night. (Jessica Contrera/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the total living environment of the Village, resist the forces of NIMBY and keep the dog park open,\u201d one neighbor wrote.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I will leave no stone, I mean tennis ball unturned in our dogged opposition to the proposal to close the park,\u201d declared a \u201cpress releash\u201d sent by one resident, Patty Martin, in the voice of her French bulldog Louie.\n\nOn Monday night, 12 people lined up to voice their support of the park in person, despite pleading from the board that only those who have yet to submit comments take the microphone.\n\n\u201cThe dogs are voices of living beings,\u201d said Judi Dash, a resident wearing a \u201cMake Woof Not War\u201d t-shirt. \u201cThe nice people who live behind me [do carpentry] in the summer, spring and fall. It\u2019s really loud. Should I tell him to hammer less?\u201d\n\nTheir poetic odes to the park weren\u2019t persuasive enough to those in power.\n\n\u201cI saw Chubbs and Louie play together before they were internationally famous, and I would challenge even the staunchest critics of the park to keep smiles off their face when watching those two. But on the other hand,\u201d said board treasurer Gary Crockett, \u201cthere\u2019s only so much you can do when you have maybe 10 or more dogs in the park at one time that are three feet from someone\u2019s backyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI move to disestablish\u2013\u201d board member Richard Ruda began.\n\n\u201cLouder please!\u201d yelled a voice from the back of the room.\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry about that. Are you sure you want to hear this?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried a chorus.\n\n\u201cOk, sorry I asked,\u201d he said. \u201cI move to disestablish the dog area, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, Leonard tried to reassure the park\u2019s fans that the village manager had spoken with Montgomery County officials, who are planning to build additional dog parks in the area soon. But the dog lovers were already storming out of the town hall. They surrounded Martin, who was devastated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I am going to break this to Louie,\u201d she said.\n\nBut inside, the board\u2019s decision seemed final.\n\n\u201cWe have to move on to the next item on our agenda,\u201d Leonard told the remaining crowd. \u201cThe noise of gas-powered leaf blowers.\u201d", "description": "After months of complaints about barking, the Chevy Chase Village Board voted to turn the canine haven into a regular park", "authors": ["Jessica Contrera", "Enterprise Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iuTUQxVlm6aHtUrWyNEJb4GHojQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5Y32NWGFCMI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
