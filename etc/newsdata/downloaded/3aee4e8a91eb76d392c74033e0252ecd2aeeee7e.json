There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,\" he said, adding that \"elections have consequences.\"\n\nHe later tried to walk back those comments.\n\nWatch: 'Get Over It'\n\nMulvaney said that he wasn't involved with the other request that Trump made of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2014 to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBut he did admit that Trump held up aid to Ukraine as part of a quid pro quo \u2014 something Trump himself has denied.\n\nMulvaney later tried to recharacterize his remarks. Though he had multiple opportunities to walk back his comments during the press conference with reporters, the acting chief of staff said in a statement Thursday evening that there \"was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election\" nor \"any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\"\n\nIn the press briefing, the president's top aide argued that the administration held up the money so that the Ukrainian government would comply with an ongoing investigation into the 2016 elections and that it \"had absolutely nothing to do with the Bidens\" or the 2020 race.\n\nOn his phone call with Zelenskiy, Trump brought up a debunked conspiracy theory that it may have been Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 that interfered in the 2016 election and that a Democratic National Committee server was being stored somewhere in Ukraine.\n\nA senior Justice Department official later told NPR's Ryan Lucas that \"if the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.\"\n\nIt became clear later on Thursday that Trump's private legal team was not happy with Mulvaney's performance and statements.\n\n\"The President's legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press briefing,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement.\n\nIn broad terms, during the press conference, Mulvaney further strengthened the accounts formed so far of the Ukraine affair, also including Trump's reliance on his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTrump, as president, can give assignments to anyone he wants, Mulvaney said, and he faulted Democrats \u2014 who are conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump in connection with the Ukraine scheme \u2014 for being disappointed there is no \"cover-up.\"\n\nA whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. But as Mulvaney observed, the White House released a memorandum of a call Trump had with Zelenskiy on July 25 and has been open about its conduct.\n\n\"No one here had any problem with the call,\" Mulvaney said Thursday.\n\nTrump told one diplomat inside the administration, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, that there was no \"quid pro quo\" with Ukraine, which Sondland later related to counterparts in text messages that have since been released by Democrats.\n\nBut Sondland told House investigators on Thursday that he didn't know in real time about the broader scheme to try to extract the political investigations from Zelenskiy.\n\nIn his written opening statement, Sondland also said the account of Trump's call with Zelenskiy that he received included no mention of the Bidens \u2014 suggesting that, if true, the White House circulated a sanitized version of the conversation within the administration and one different from the one it later issued publicly.\n\nAt the White House on Thursday, Mulvaney kept up the White House argument that withholding the aid to Ukraine was tied to \"cleaning up corruption\" in Ukraine.\n\nWatch: Money Holdup Had 'Nothing To Do With Biden'\n\nNPR's David Welna has reported that, in May, the Pentagon certified that Ukraine had \"taken substantial actions\" to curtail the country's corruption.\n\nMulvaney also in the briefing room that the 2020 Group of Seven conference will be held at the president's own resort, Trump National Doral in Miami.\n\nAs NPR's Brett Neely reports, \"The Trump administration's decision to host the high-profile international summit at Doral is sure to stoke the ongoing controversy about Trump's decision to maintain his ownership of his businesses while also serving as president.\"\n\nWatch: Full Press Briefing\n\nNPR's Philip Ewing contributed to this report.", "description": "In a rare press briefing, the acting chief of staff said the president held up aid to Ukraine as part of a quid pro quo.
