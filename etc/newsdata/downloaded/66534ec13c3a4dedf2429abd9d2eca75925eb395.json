Former communications minister Mitch Fifield will take his ease on New York\u2019s East River in a fortnight, having resigned from the Senate on August 16 and his replacement, former Corangamite MP Sarah Henderson, awaiting only the Victorian Parliament\u2019s ratification of her preselection to take his place on the red leather. Profound mediocrity has\u2026\n\nHaving plotted against prime minister Tony Abbott in 2015 and vaulting into Cabinet, Fifield then doublecrossed Malcolm Turnbull last August, lining up behind Peter Dutton. Little wonder Scott Morrison induced him outta there. The man\u2019s estrangement from loyalty aside, 15 years as a complete ministerial passenger secured his absence from the Liberal pantheon.\n\nOn Friday, Fifield gathered those who still remember him for lunch at Melbourne institution, Bamboo House. It was also a chance for Future Fund and Nine chairman Peter Costello to gaze upon his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s: with Fifield, Speaker Tony Smith, state opposition leader Michael O\u2019Brien and GRACosway managing director Richard King, all alumni of the Treasurer\u2019s office. A motley legacy \u2013 like with Costello\u2019s 11 budgets, a couple didn\u2019t quite sing. Former Liberal state director (and now Asahi executive) Julian Sheezel rounded out the table.\n\nFifield\u2019s residence on Beekman Place adjoins that of Australia\u2019s Consul General, Alastair Walton, whose term expires in July. A Goldman Sachs vulgarian appointed senselessly by Turnbull, ScoMo is no fan. Tick tock\u2026\n\nThese people. And in New York! It bears contemplation by any prime minister\u2019s confidant (or irritant): imagine where you might get sent if you were half good.", "description": "On Friday, Fifield gathered those who still remember him for lunch at Melbourne institution, Bamboo House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.501%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_844%2C$y_192/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cff9813a0cbd04674713d9f66a12e21acbf5dc47", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
