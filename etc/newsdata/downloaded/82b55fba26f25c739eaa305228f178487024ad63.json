(Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) More\n\nAbout last night\n\nIn a likely preview of Republican messaging for the 2020 election, an ad from a GOP PAC that aired during Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate showed a photograph of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., with her face engulfed in flames.\n\nThe ad from the New Faces PAC, a group with the self-described mission of broadening the GOP\u2019s appeal to youth, minorities and women, is narrated by Elizabeth Heng, a Republican who lost a California congressional race in 2018. In the video, as the fire consumes Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s face the photo peels away to reveal images from the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s \u2014 skulls in heaps, bodies lined up on the ground, a starving family.\n\n\u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horrors of socialism?\u201d Heng intones. \u201cForced obedience, starvation.\u201d\n\nThe Republican New Faces PAC debuted by burning @AOC's face. pic.twitter.com/JFowetC7Nd \u2014 CPD Action (@CPDAction) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cMine is a face of freedom. My skin is not white. I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, nor a socialist,\u201d Heng adds. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican.\u201d\n\nCambodia was ruled for about five years by the Khmer Rouge, headed by Pol Pot. As much as a quarter of the country\u2019s population died as a result of forced relocations to villages, famine and political purges.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge ideology was communist, or more precisely Stalinist, far removed from the brand of democratic socialism espoused by Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe freshman congresswoman, who has become a frequent target on the right, responded on Twitter.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist. Life is weird!\u201d wrote Ocasio-Cortez, adding, \u201cKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2014 that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d\n\nAccording to filings, New Faces PAC raised just over $175,000 between Jan. 1 and June 30, mostly from the same donors who financed Heng\u2019s congressional run. Per the PAC\u2019s website, its goal is to \u201chelp elevate the next generation of Republicans so that we can not only survive as a party, but expand beyond the boundaries we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\u201d Before she lost her congressional race to Rep. Jim Costa by 15 points, Heng was hailed by the Wall Street Journal as a potential \u201cOcasio-Cortez for the GOP.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, Ocasio-Cortez criticized ABC News and Sinclair, which owns a Washington, D.C., affiliate that broadcast the debate, for airing the ad.\n\n\u201cGOP\u2019s message: No policy, no facts, just displays of violence + corporations like @ABCNetwork & Sinclair who amplify them,\u201d wrote Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cThey profit from burning my likeness on TV. But who pays for heightened security? Who answers the phones for the threats resulting from a violent, false ad?\u201d\n\nShe was not the only one critical of the ad.\n\n\u201cThis ad is abhorrent,\u201d wrote the Twitter account for UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group. \u201cLiterally burning @AOC and promoting violence against a sitting member of congress. How did you let this on the air @ABCNetwork?\u201d", "description": "In a likely preview of Republican messaging for the 2020 election, an ad from a GOP PAC that aired during Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate showed a photograph of Rep.
