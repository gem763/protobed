Again.\n\nNew data from Brazil\u2019s space research agency shows the devastation. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) said its satellite data showed an 84% increase in fire loss from the same period in 2018, well greater than what might typically be expected from losses in the fire-prone dry season that includes this month, it asserts.\n\nBrazilian-published satellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees over the first half of this year; it\u2019s home to the majority of the Amazon rainforest, which contribute approximately 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, scientists noted. The Bolsonaro administration has favored development by loggers and farmers over conservation, his detractors emphasize.\n\nLast Friday, Finland\u2019s finance minister Mika Lintila called on European Union leaders to \u201curgently review the possibility of banning Brazilian beef imports\u201d over the fires. Finland currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. In 2018, Brazil was the world\u2019s largest exporter of beef, providing nearly 20% of total global beef exports, outpacing India, the second-largest exporter, by 527,000 metric tons carcass weight equivalent, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 5 highly-ranked charities helping with the Amazon rainforest fires\n\nCollectively, the world\u2019s population has eaten about 140 billion metric tons more food than we need, estimate scientists Elisabetta Toti of the Italian Council for Agricultural Research and Economics, and Carla Di Mattia and Mauro Serafini of Italy\u2019s University of Teramo. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, according to the World Health Organization. In fact, obesity has tripled world-wide since 1975. Nearly two billion people worldwide are now overweight, including about two-fifths of adults. And approximately 650 million people are obese.\n\nThe latest research is published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition. \u201cHigh energy foods have been shown to be the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, challenging the diet-environment-health triangle,\u201d the authors said. \u201cThe waste of resources and the unnecessary ecological cost due to an excessive consumption of foods leading to obesity have been ignored so far. Metabolic Food Waste corresponds to the amount of food leading to excess body fat and its impact on the environment, expressed as carbon, water and land footprint.\u201d\n\nTheir calculations are based on global databases of populations and food consumption. Most of the overeating took place in Europe and the United States, followed by Latin America and the richer countries of Asia, such as Japan, they added. The biggest culprits among the food groups were dairy products (and eggs), followed by alcoholic drinks, cereals and meat.\n\nAlso see: KFC is selling meatless fried chicken \u2014 is it actually healthier than the real thing?\n\nFood production puts a strain on the world\u2019s water and land resources, scientists say. It also causes the production of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that are contributing to climate change. Among their findings: The farmland needed to produce all that extra, unneeded food was about 400 times the size of the entire United States, according to the new calculations. Approximately 345,000 cubic kilometers\u201428 Lake Superiors\u2014was needed to produce all the extra food we consume.\n\nAs much as 40% of food goes uneaten in the U.S. Americans throw away $165 billion in wasted food every year, according to Harvard Law School\u2019s Food Law and Policy Clinic and the Natural Resources Defense Council, or NRDC, a nonprofit environmental action group. Some 160 billion pounds of discarded food also clogs up landfills. Worldwide, one-third of the world\u2019s food \u2014 some 1.3 billion tons \u2014 is also lost or wasted every year, according to the United Nations Environment Program. \u201cFood waste is responsible for over 7% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key challenge in tackling climate change,\u201d the UN says.\n\nThe evidence about environmental damage and climate change is piling up to the point where it\u2019s increasingly hard even for skeptics to ignore. The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded. July was the hottest month ever recorded. Sea levels are rising. Some sources say the soil erosion in America\u2019s farmland is reaching dangerous levels. The WHO estimates that more than 1.9 billion adults and 41 million children under the age of five are overweight or obese.\n\n(Rachel Koning Beals contributed to this report.)", "description": "The global obesity epidemic is also an environmental catastrophe, scientists have warned.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI443_Obesit_ZG_20190429113340.jpg"}
