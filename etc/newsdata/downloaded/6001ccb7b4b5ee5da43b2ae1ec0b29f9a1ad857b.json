I think their ego is actually forcing them to go out there and do it.\n\n\"If it encourages a different demographic to tune in to a different pay-per-view event, then that helps the sport of boxing.\n\n\"It genuinely helps every other fighter on the undercard, they\u2019re getting paid at pay-per-view, the show wouldn't be that without Logan Paul and KSI.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"With KSI and Logan Paul fighting it just then puts more money in the pot for these other boxers, so I think it\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\"Haney could fight on his own card in his own hometown, but with what television and ticket sales?\n\n\"He could do that and have his face as the main picture but he would get paid significantly less.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll probably fight on this card and get paid five times more than he normally would.\n\n\"Some people might tune in just to see the real boxers, the world-class boxers, but the majority probably won\u2019t - they\u2019ll be just tuning in to see KSI and Logan Paul and hopefully once they tune in to see that, they may see some world-class boxers.\"", "description": "KSI and Paul will clash for a second time on November 9 in Los Angeles in order to settle their rivalry", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550730.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-v-Logan-Paul-2-Press-Conference-Troxy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
