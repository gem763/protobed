If the Letwin amendment passes and the Bill comes in next week and it passes by October 31 we leave on October 31, yes or no?\n\n\u201cIf the Letwin amendment doesn\u2019t pass and the Bill comes through next week and it doesn\u2019t pass by October 31, we leave with no deal, yes or no?\u201d\n\nResponding Mr Barclay said: \u201cWhat is yes is to proceed we need to pass section 13 (to allow a meaningful vote). That is an argument he and many others have repeatedly raised. That is why it is important we defeat this amendment to deliver that and avoid any further delay.\u201d\n\nIndependent MP Nick Boles, who quit the Conservative Party in April over the Government\u2019s Brexit stance, intervened to say: \u201cIf the Letwin amendment passes and the Government brings forward the Bill at the start of next week, and that Bill passes before October 31, we will leave on October 31 without a delay.\u201d\n\nThe Grantham and Stamford MP added that if pro-Brexit MPs then decide they \u201cprefer the idea of a no-deal Brexit and the Bill fails we will leave on October with no deal\u201d.\n\n12.35pm\n\nBrexit supporters have taken to the streets in Manchester.

But under the circumstances there are three things I thought I should share with the House.\n\n\u201cOne, the officers overwhelmingly recommended backing the Prime Minister\u2019s deal. The ERG overwhelmingly recommended the same, and no member of the ERG spoke against it.\n\n\u201cThirdly, and most importantly, we agreed that if you vote for the deal, you vote for the Bill. And if the deal is passed today, we will faithfully vote the Bill through to the end, so we can leave the European Union.

Four out of the five parties in Northern Ireland want it up and running?\u201d\n\nResponding, Mr Barclay said: \u201cThis is about a reserved matter that applies to our international agreements as a United Kingdom and not the powers that sit with the Assembly within the Good Friday agreement. And that is why there wasn\u2019t a willingness to give one community a power of veto over the other.\u201d\n\nMr Dodds rejected this assessment, adding: \u201cIt is simply not true to say that agriculture and manufactured goods and so on are reserved matters. These are matters devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. This is just not correct.

It\u2019d cause further delay when our constituents and our businesses want an end to uncertainty and are calling for us to get this done.\n\n\u201cThe public will be appalled by pointless further delay.

It's the sheer disingenuous that riles me. #SuperSaturday \u2014 Liz Truss (@trussliz) October 19, 2019\n\nI know I\u2019m biased, but that was a really excellent speech from @BorisJohnson Unlike Corbyn, he got the tone absolutely right which is so important \u2014 Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorries) October 19, 2019\n\nNot a single mention of \u201cScotland\u201d ( or \u201cWales\u201d) in Johnson\u2019s entire #Brexit statement. Says it all. Bluster and bombast that means nothing. None of his pledges can be believed. \u2014 Michael Russell (@Feorlean) October 19, 2019\n\n10.20am\n\nMr Johnson said Mr Corbyn was \u201cwrong\u201d about his claims on environmental and social protection, saying: \u201cThis Government, this country will maintain the very highest standards and we will lead in environmental protection and social protection in Europe and across the world.\u201d\n\n(House of Commons/PA)\n\nMr Johnson also said: \u201cHe talks about trust \u2013 this is a right honourable gentleman\u2026 who patently does not trust his own party, he doesn\u2019t trust the shadow chancellor.\n\n\u201cAbove all he has not been willing to trust the people of this country by granting them the right to adjudicate on him and his policies in a general election.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t trust the people and he doesn\u2019t trust the people by delivering on the result of their referendum in 2016.\n\n\u201cI suggest in all humility and candour to the House that they should ignore the pleadings of (Mr Corbyn) and vote for an excellent deal that will take this country and take the whole of Europe forward.\u201d\n\n10.14am\n\nMr Corbyn said: \u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit, it won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say.\n\n\u201cLabour is not prepared to sell out the communities that we represent. We are not prepared to sell out their future and we will not back this sell-out deal.\n\n\u201cThis is about our communities now and about our future generations.\u201d\n\n10.11am\n\nMr Corbyn said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good deal for our country and future generations will feel the impact, it should be voted down today by this House.\n\n\u201cI also totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House, but we simply cannot vote for a deal that is even worse than the one the House rejected three times.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSupporting the Government this afternoon would merely fire the starting pistol in a race to the bottom in regulations and standards.\u201d\n\n10.08am\n\nMr Corbyn said the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit deal risks \u201cthousands of British jobs\u201d.\n\nHe told MPs: \u201cThousands of British jobs depend on a strong manufacturing sector and a strong manufacturing sector needs markets through fluid supply-chains all across the European Union. A vote for this deal would be a vote to cut manufacturing all across this country.\n\n\u201cThis deal would absolutely inevitably lead to a Trump trade deal, forcing the UK to diverge from the highest standards and expose our families once again to chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.\u201d\n\nThe Labour leader said he would not hand the Government a \u201cblank cheque\u201d on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.\n\nMr Corbyn concluded that \u201cvoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will not back this sell-out deal.\u201d\n\n10.05am\n\nResponding to Mr Johnson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that \u201cthis Government can\u2019t be trusted and these benches will not be duped\u201d.\n\n(House of Commons/PA)\n\nHe told the Commons: \u201c(Mr Johnson) has renegotiated the Withdrawal Agreement and made it even worse. He has renegotiated the Political Declaration and made that even worse.\u201d\n\nHe bemoaned the lack of an economic impact assessment and accompanying legal advice for the Brexit deal.\n\nMr Corbyn added Mr Johnson has made \u201cempty promises\u201d on workers\u2019 rights and the environment.", "description": "Boris Johnson has appealed to MPs to end a `painful chapter\u00b4 as the October 31 deadline for withdrawal looms.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/12/wire-19920752-1571485139-427_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
