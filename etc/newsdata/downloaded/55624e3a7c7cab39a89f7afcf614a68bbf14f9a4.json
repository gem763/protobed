We did not want to get involved in a conflict that dates back nearly 200 years between the Turks and the Kurds.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Times reports: \u201cHundreds of relatives of Islamic State fighters fled a Kurdish-run detention camp on Sunday morning after Turkish airstrikes hit the surrounding area.\n\nLast week, the Trump White House announced that Turkey would be responsible for all ISIS prisoners:\n\nThe United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused. The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial \u201cCaliphate\u201d by the United States.\n\nThis morning on Face the Nation, Secretary of Defense Esper said that he and other U.S. officials had warned Turkey for weeks that a Turkish invasion of Syria would cause the \u201clikely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons.\u201d\n\nRetired general Jack Keane wrote on Twitter Sunday morning: \u201cShame: while Kurds are slaughtered US military in full retreat in eastern Syria. Giving up control of airspace enables Turk invasion.\u201d", "description": "The administration won\u2019t call it a \u201cretreat.\u201d", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Rich Lowry", "Zachary Evans", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kyle Smith", "Read More", "The American Conservative"], "top_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
