(CBC News)\n\nFraser said the city would again follow its seven-day snow plan, which prioritizes various roads and sidewalks for snow removal within a weekly timeframe.\n\n\"That hasn't changed, with the exception of some of the infrastructure that's been added into the plan, including the cycle tracks,\" he said.\n\nAccording to data from Environment Canada, between 1884 and 2011 Calgary saw the greatest snowfall the weekend of Sept. 27 in 1925, when snowfall ranged between 6.6 and 19.8 centimetres.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of public weather alerts, visit the agency's website.", "description": "Drop your rake and grab your shovel: Environment Canada warns that the snow will start falling in southern Alberta on Friday and may continue right through to Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4457810.1548271385!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winter-driving.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
