Photo: Getty Images\n\nWho among us has not, at one point or another, set out to enjoy a nice afternoon on the links, our polo shirts tucked securely into our khakis, only to misfire on a swing, and accidentally take an animal\u2019s life?\n\nOh, no one? Just Minnesota senator and 2020 presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar? All right.\n\nKlobuchar shared this highly specific, supposedly humanizing anecdote at a United Food and Commercial Workers forum in Detroit on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI did one time try to play golf \u2026 I misfired on the first try, and the ball hit a duck in the head, and it appeared to perish,\u201d Klobuchar said, to groans from the audience. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for the bird population of America if I play golf.\u201d\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR ADMITS SHE KILLED A DUCK WHILE GOLFING #UFCWForum pic.twitter.com/IpWGjWc2PJ \u2014 Brett Banditelli (@banditelli) September 29, 2019\n\nThis is not the first time Klobuchar has hurled a projectile to disastrous effects. In February, HuffPost and BuzzFeed reported that Klobuchar had allegedly mistreated her staff, berating them, and occasionally throwing objects at them, including a binder. (Over 60 former staffers later wrote an open letter defending the senator, saying she was a caring \u201cmentor and friend\u201d to them.)\n\nKlobuchar has struggled to gain footing in the crowded Democratic primary race. Currently, she\u2019s polling at about 2 percent, positioning herself as a moderate candidate, emphasizing bipartisanship.\n\nGoing forward, ducks and other waterfowl \u2014 hot or otherwise \u2014 will presumably watch the primary race with renewed interest for their own safety. If they\u2019re lucky, maybe they\u2019ll catch a break like the groundhogs.\n\nStay in touch.
