Jenkins hinted at big news a short while ago, and having signed with Dominance MMA and manager Ali Abdelaziz, he hopes doors and opportunities for his career will open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the champ right now at 145 in Brave and my ranking in the world is going up,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI guess you could saying I\u2019m buzzing like a bee after steamrolling a pretty famous Brazilian fighter and I think I\u2019m just going to listen to the kingmaker (Abdelaziz). He\u2019s got all these people here, he\u2019s done a lot of good things for their career.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big news is that I\u2019m finally living up to that ability that I would say the game knew I was going to come with.\u201d\n\nJenkins who trains at Blackhouse MMA, was chose by Mackenzie Dern to be her wrestling coach, as the strawweight star has decided to downsize her training camp in preparation for her fight vs. Amanda Ribas on Saturday at UFC on ESPN+ 19 in Tampa.\n\nAnd with his strong wrestling background, Jenkins has been able to build and develop into a well-rounded fighter as he looks to let the world know who he is.\n\n\u201cI knew that I was going to be good and I knew that I could do great things with my wrestling ability,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAnd just the fact that I was a smart athlete and putting the striking, the MMA, the jiu-jitsu, putting it all together to complete science of who I am. I stopped trying to mould myself into all these other things that people wanted me to be. I started to see the game for myself and I made my own vision of what I wanted to be and now I am that, and I\u2019m walking in that. I finally know who I am and what I am so that\u2019s what clicked.\u201d\n\nFor more from Jenkins, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Brave CF featherweight champion Bubba Jenkins believes he's finally living up to his ability.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bubba-jenkins-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
