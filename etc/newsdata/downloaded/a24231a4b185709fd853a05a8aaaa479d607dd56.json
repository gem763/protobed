About 900,000 people remained in the dark Wednesday, some since Saturday.\n\n\u201cNorthern California residents are exhausted. They\u2019re fried. And this is completely unacceptable,\u201d said state Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat who represents vast swaths of areas still in the dark. \u201cCalifornians deserve better from this utility.\u201d\n\nWinds calmed down Wednesday, easing the dangerous fire conditions and allowing PG&E to shift its focus to getting the electricity back on.\n\nBut the pain moved south, where several fires broke out amid howling winds in the Los Angeles area and forced evacuations. The utility in the region, Southern California Edison, shut off power to 178,000 people.\n\nTwo powerful windstorms have pounded Northern California in less than a week, prompting PG&E to shut off the lights three times in one week and four times this month. But its equipment still may have ignited a massive blaze in Sonoma County wine country that has destroyed 94 homes and forced more than 150,000 people to flee.\n\nPG&E faced crushing condemnation for its poor execution in the first widespread blackout Oct. 9 \u2014 its website failed, and customers couldn\u2019t get through by phone. People were confused about when and where the power would go out.\n\nLocal governments complained about the lack of communication before the Oct. 9 outage and filed reports with regulators. In a response filed Wednesday with the Public Utilities Commission, PG&E acknowledged \u201cvarious, and in some cases, extreme, shortcomings, including failure of the website, and coordination with state local and tribal governments\u201d during the shut-off.\n\nBut it said it has since updated its website \u201cto provide helpful and useful information to the public.\u201d\n\nMany of its customers disagreed, saying it was difficult to get to a map of outages and find specifics on when the electricity would go off or come back on.\n\n\u201cI woke up in the middle of the night and smelled smoke. I wanted to use my phone to find if fire was nearby, but the battery was out, and without electricity, I couldn\u2019t charge it,\u201d Judy Keene said Monday.\n\nThe Berkeley resident said her old-fashioned phone didn\u2019t work either.\n\n\u201cI thought our landline would work,\u201d Keene said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we had a landline.\u201d\n\nMark Quinlan, PG&E\u2019s senior director of emergency preparedness and response, appeared stumped Tuesday night when asked how people should get information when the power is already out and many cellphone towers have stopped working.\n\n\u201cPeople could get the information from a website through family,\u201d he suggested, \u201cor they could just get it the old-fashioned way through calling on a landline.\u201d\n\nFewer than half of U.S. households have a landline, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics. More than 70% of young adults and renters have only a cellphone, the data says.\n\nLocal officials said information from PG&E has been slow and sometimes wrong or outdated, making it hard for them keep people informed.\n\n\u201cEvery time PG&E gives us information, we\u2019re really not certain whether it\u2019s accurate or not, or if that\u2019s what actually will happen,\u201d said Carmel Angelo, Mendocino County administrator.\n\nThe entire county north of San Francisco lost power, and residents and officials were told it would come back after the first windstorm passed last week. PG&E said the second wind blast this week wouldn\u2019t force blackouts in its most populous areas, but they did, she said.\n\nIn Marin County, north of San Francisco, PG&E responded to reports that it turned off power 15 hours earlier than it said it would Tuesday by blaming \u201coperational constraints\u201d because of fire and \u201ca coordination error.\u201d\n\nCommunication improved after the early October outage, but \u201cthere\u2019s still much left to be desired,\u201d said Leine Hendricks, a spokeswoman for Marin County, where residents have called wanting to know when their power would be back.\n\n\u201cResidents are like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you know?\u2019\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard question to answer. Most of the time, local government should be able to answer those questions, but this is something that\u2019s out of our hands. We\u2019re just trying to remind them that we\u2019re in the same boat.\u201d\n\nPower has come back to most of the county, she said, but thousands are still in the dark.\n\nPG&E Corp. CEO Bill Johnson said the company will give a one-time credit to customers hit by the first blackout as a \u201crecognition of things that we didn\u2019t do well.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the company implied the problems were solely related to its website and call center communications. It has not said how much it will pay.\n\n\u201cI feel like when it eventually comes back on, people are going to be like, \u2018What day is it? Where are we? What is that bright light coming from our ceiling?\u2019\u201d said Madeleine Kelley Stewart, chef and innkeeper at the Kelley & Young Wine Garden Inn, which is in an area of Sonoma County wine country that\u2019s been in the dark since Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a bunch of Neanderthals poking at fire.\u201d", "description": "As Pacific Gas & Electric deliberately shut off power to homes and businesses to prevent wildfires, it has failed to communicate with California...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT008_blacko_ZG_20191009203346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
