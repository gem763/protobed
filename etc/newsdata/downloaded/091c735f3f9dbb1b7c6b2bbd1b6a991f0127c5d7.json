In fact he said he could have killed him any time but preferred to keep him alive. \u201cI paid McSwiggin,\u201d Capone said. \u201cI paid him plenty and I got what I was paying for.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Capone was cleared of the murder and became the darling of an insatiable press pack. If you don\u2019t act guilty, will anyone really think you\u2019re guilty? Especially if everyone else is guilty too.\n\nAlmost a century later, Donald Trump has cornered the Scarface strategy. If he didn\u2019t think neo-Nazis were very fine people, Trump could win a Maccabiah medal for chutzpah.\n\nIn some corner of his orange-tipped cranium there are surely a handful of brain cells that are fully aware that his entire family has engaged with foreign dictators and their oligarchs for personal profit.\n\nBut the rest of Trump\u2019s brain is an irony-free zone entirely empty of self-awareness. So he and much of his Cabinet fanned out across the gullible media to proclaim everyone else\u2019s guilt in a Ukraine scandal that would normally lead to certain impeachment.\n\nTo be clear, the only scandal involving Ukraine is that Trump openly admits that he repeatedly pressed a foreign leader for dirt on his political opponents ahead of a presidential election. For the second election in a row. Only this time, he could use the promise of military and foreign aid to grease his request.\n\nIt\u2019s worth quoting Trump\u2019s bizarre explanation of this gambit in full, describing his call to the newly-elected president of Ukraine as follows: \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cIt was largely corruption. All of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNow Donald Trump is something of an expert in corruption, if not creating to the corruption. It takes a great deal of creativity to get your own vice-president to stay at your Irish hotel when it\u2019s 180 miles away from his meetings in Dublin. You can\u2019t even conceive of the creativity needed to explain away the US Air Force staying at a luxury golf resort in Scotland that just happens to be another Trump property.\n\nTrump\u2019s excuse was that he knew nothing about the military staying at his hotel, and had nothing to do with Mike Pence\u2019s long commute from Doonbeg to Dublin. So what if Pence\u2019s chief of staff said Trump had made a suggestion about the stay? He just had great taste \u2013 like the military that loves Turnberry so much.\n\nTrump apparently knows nothing about his own officials lining his own pockets. But he does know a thing or two about Ukraine.\n\nIt was at his own convention in 2016 when his own campaign chairman changed his own party platform to weaken US support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine\u2019s politics.\n\n\u201cUkraine has got a lot of problems,\u201d Trump explained to reporters. \u201cThe new president is saying that he\u2019s going to be able to rid the country of corruption. And I said that would be a great thing. We had a great conversation. We backed \u2013 I backed Ukraine from the beginning.\u201d\n\nAmnesia is a terrible problem for today\u2019s world leaders. Especially the morally dubious ones who are either too brazen or too lazy to think of a decent excuse.\n\nSomehow Trump has forgotten about how bad a liar his lawyer is, or why Ukraine is even enmeshed in the multiple scandals that would lead to the impeachment of any other president.\n\nWould Trump let Rudy Giuliani testify to Congress about his own efforts?\n\n\u201cOh I would have no problem with it,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cRudy is a very straight shooter. And Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people with respect to your Ukraine. Ukraine has had a tremendous corruption problem. Somehow they were involved in a lot of different things that took place in our country, and hopefully it can be straightened out.\u201d\n\nHopefully we can straighten this out for you, Mr President. Rudy shoots so straight that he can break land speed records for lying on national television. Did he ask Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Joe Biden? \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d he told CNN, before admitting 30 seconds later, \u201cof course I did.\u201d\n\nSomehow Ukraine was involved in a lot of things in American politics, Mr President. Most of them involving Paul Manafort, your old campaign chairman, now serving time in jail for tax evasion on all the cash he made from Ukraine\u2019s former president. The one supported by Vladimir Putin, whom you asked for help to hack into the emails of your opponents in the last election during a press conference.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect call. A perfect call,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cWhat wasn\u2019t perfect is the horrible thing that Joe Biden said. And now he made it a lie when he said he never spoke to his son. I mean, give me a break. He\u2019s already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn\u2019t speak to your son? Of course you spoke to your son. So he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son.\u201d\n\nThe son thing is troubling, Mr President. Troubling because you sound unhinged.\n\n\u201cBut more importantly,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cwhat he said about the billions of dollars that he wouldn\u2019t give them unless they fired the prosecutor. And then he bragged about how they fired the prosecutor and they got the money.\u201d\n\nOh yes. The money thing. It\u2019s a beauty. Biden is smeared by the most braggadociously corrupt president for pushing Ukraine to have a prosecutor who will fight corruption.\n\nIt may be no surprise that Trump is circling the drain while clinging on to his own dizzy conspiracies. His election prospects are miserable and he desperately needs another looney-tuned cartoon like the Clinton email saga.\n\nBut it\u2019s still surprising to see his secretary of state and Treasury secretary peddling the same smear as if it was just another Sunday talk show subject.\n\nIs there anyone left with any self-respect in the Republican party? Step forward Mitt Romney, the former Republican nominee and now Utah senator. No really, step forward.\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,\u201d Romney tweeted.\n\nDamn the torpedoes. The senator is extremely troubled, if not rather exercised, by the possibility of something that Trump and Giuliani have already admitted on camera.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what the next 14 months of the presidential election looks like, you are already looking at it. The poor citizens of Ukraine have been looking at it for the last five years, ever since Russian troops marched in and unleashed their disinformation on an unsuspecting world.\n\nLike Vladimir Putin, Al Capone knew that don\u2019t have to be smart to get away with murder. You just have to confuse everyone about what guilt looks like.", "description": "If you\u2019re wondering what the next 14 months of the presidential election looks like, you are already looking at it", "authors": ["Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cbe87921299b2a8d10896088f2a63df4b988bd3/0_115_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7a0657127d4be638bc101ca5f198ff6c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
