The questions that arise are, to name a few: Does she have cancer, or is she faking it? Should they try to find out? What should they do if she is? What should they do if it comes out? The team is divided, with James urging plausible deniability, and that\u2019s just not going to happen, because Payton seems to have made room for all that capital-A Ambition by tossing his stores of impulse control right over the side of a Disney cruise ship. A lot happens in this episode, but the mystery that\u2019s being spun out\u2014what, if anything, is wrong with Infinity?\u2014takes up most of the oxygen, and it\u2019s just not right! Bob Balaban did not put on his finest smoking jacket to play second fiddle!\n\nThe Politician\u2019s wildly stylish second episode\u2014directed by Brad Falchuk and written by Falchuk, Ryan Murphy, and Ian Brennan\u2014takes the occasional Wes Anderson vibe of the premiere and turns the dial all the way up. I thought that the perfectly centered wooden crate bearing the words \u201cCRATE 1\u201d being opened to reveal beautiful rare books while a male voice lovingly covers a classic British rock song was too much, and then the hands carrying the crate were revealed to be Balaban\u2019s. He\u2019s there to set up the story that, impossibly, feels like the episode\u2019s B-plot: Georgina is in love with one of the family\u2019s horse trainers, Brigitte (played by tennis legend Martina Navratilova, natch), is no longer willing to pretend to love her husband (that\u2019s Balaban), and would like a divorce. The second the words are out of her mouth, he takes off at a run (a very scampery run, it must be said), and uses the very valuable, and titular, commode to dive straight out the window. This, we learn, happens to Georgina a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why the first episode, which shares a lot in common with the second, managed to carry so much emotional weight when this one often feels so hollow. Are we meant to share Georgina\u2019s concern about Payton\u2019s ruthlessness? Are we meant to worry that he\u2019s losing his humanity? Because \u2014 and this may sound contradictory \u2014 that was already happening, and I\u2019m also not sure how to be worried that Payton lacks humanity when the episode makes time for him to cry with the memory-ghost of his lost love. (It\u2019s a beautiful scene but not exactly serving the \u201cPayton is too devious. Is he even a person?\u201d thesis.) In fact, the better argument would seem to be that the world sees Payton that way, assuming he\u2019s onboard with forking over cash to people who have no issue with making sure he knows it\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s good for.\n\nAnd what, beyond that Disney cruise, does that have to do with Infinity\u2019s situation? Having decided to stick with Infinity for the time being, Payton and his running mate host a \u201csmash the patriarchy\u201d event, charging $250 a pop for the chance to swing a maul at Rolls Royce (don\u2019t worry, someone poured gas in the tank). While giving an interview about the event, Infinity seems unwell, and mentions that she just had a treatment, and after she picks up the tool to take her swing, she faints.\n\nShe also mentions that her nana hasn\u2019t told her what kind of cancer she has, because it\u2019s better not to know. And by the time Jessica Lange comes storming into the emergency room, ripping the tubes out of her granddaughter\u2019s arms and demanding that the staff stop with their meddling medical care, a picture begins to form. It\u2019s very upsetting, so \u2014 well done, Ms. Lange, you have terrified us again. It will take another act or so before any of the characters seem to start to question anything there, though I would guess many of you have a pretty damned good idea what\u2019s happening. Murphy, Falchuk, and Brennan didn\u2019t seem to think that was likely.\n\nAdmittedly, Payton\u2019s head does get turned from the distressing scene in the ER by the timely reappearance of Andrew, who just likes to get high and is there to remind him that, in his humble opinion, Infinity is totally faking it. He has been in love with her for years, he says, and watches her closely. When he took his suspicions to the special-ed teacher, he got two weeks of detention for his trouble \u2014 but he\u2019s still convinced.\n\n\u201cStop asking questions,\u201d James (Theo Germaine) bellows when Payton brings his team this new information, urging Payton to stop listening to Andrew, who likes to get high. Germaine is terrific in their scenes in this episode, almost whistling like a freaking Instant Pot, the mounting frustration painfully evident and the sense of impending doom plain on their face. And, of course, Payton heads right on over to Infinity\u2019s for dinner.\n\nAt this point, I would like to remind you that Payton\u2019s dad jumped out a window and is in a coma.\n\nThis is why the Infinity scenes weigh down this episode, which is admittedly pretty bonkers but not boring. Based on the way the story is being told, there\u2019s no way Infinity has cancer. If she does, it would probably come as a great surprise to Nana, or at least to the nefarious-looking med tech who takes care of Infinity exclusively. At least in this scene \u2014 before Infinity\u2019s bizarre over-the-shirt maneuvers \u2014 we return to one of the more interesting ideas in this jumble of an episode, in which Dusty (that\u2019s Nana) becomes the first person to attempt to extort something from a member of the Hobart contingent. But then the scenes turns to the Infinity mystery again, and if you are a person who is genuinely intrigued and unable to fathom what\u2019s going on, then I sincerely apologize, but it seems as though the writers think this is subtle, and it is not.\n\nThe next money-focused element of Payton\u2019s story in this episode comes in the next scene, as the faux Winklevii (played by Trevor and Trey Eason, rather than Armie Hammer and Armie Hammer) and their father\u2019s lawyers inform Georgina and Payton that they\u2019re about to be cut off from the family fortune. Tonally, it\u2019s one of the stranger scenes in the episode, with Paltrow playing things mostly earnestly and everyone else doing something else. It doesn\u2019t look like recognizable human behavior, and that would be fine if there were something behind it. But it\u2019s just hollow. And it\u2019s also just another stopgap between Infinity-centric scenes. (Many of these, I should note, are just about Zoey Deutch, who is not the problem here \u2014 though she does tend to go a bit wide some of the time.)\n\nLet\u2019s make it quick: The gist is that someone has finally suggested that perhaps Infinity is sick because someone is making her sick. Watch The Act; it is very good. McAfee cooks up a scheme in a hurry, organizing a blood drive that welcomes people not normally allowed to give blood, so they can get their hands on a sample. Suuure. James is pissed to have been excluded, Astrid and Skye are pissed that they didn\u2019t think of it first, and Infinity should be pissed that someone is stealing her blood, although she doesn\u2019t know yet. By episode\u2019s end, we learn that Infinity is cancer free, so presumably the next episode will focus almost exclusively on whether Infinity knows she\u2019s cancer free. Maybe by episode six, we\u2019ll know the whole story. Just in time for the last two episodes.\n\nIt\u2019s not great for the show, nor for Payton. Even when he wins, he loses. Harvard shows up with an acceptance letter; the price is a new language department. He declines. He gets the twins out of the will by convincing them that he\u2019s going to get them out of the will, knowing there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll try to kill Bob Balaban who, by the way, is no longer in a coma and loves Payton now. (That scene, showing Payton \u201cdirecting\u201d the coma, is pure Rushmore.) But even that love comes at a price: It costs Georgina her lover and costs Payton the idea that his father might ever show love or support, just for the hell of it.\n\nIt\u2019s a mess. But there is, buried in there, an interesting idea. How can you value something intangible \u2014 love, personal achievement, friendship \u2014 if it comes to you only because of money or power? What, if anything, will ever truly belong to this kid?\n\nTalking Points\n\n\u2022 More on Thomas Eagleton.\n\n\u2022 \u201cDid you listen to the Menendez Brothers tapes like I asked you?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Costume of the episode: Pink. Cape. Suit. Also worth noting that Payton\u2019s mustard-yellow sweater matches the house far better than the rich-guy drag the twins were wearing.\n\n\u2022 \u201cIs this like the others? The Brazilian ceramist? The cliff diver? That horrible cartoonist?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cOf course, you\u2019re too rich.\u201d\n\nIn crisis?
