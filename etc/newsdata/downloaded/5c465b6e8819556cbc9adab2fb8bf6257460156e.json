Critics of the industry said opioid makers hid the addiction and abuse risks of prolonged use from consumers.\n\nDefendants in the litigation also include the drugmaker Endo International Plc; pharmacy operators CVS Health Corp , Rite Aid Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Walmart Inc; and major distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp, among others.\n\nPolster also rejected separate dismissal requests by the generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Allergan Plc.\n\nLawyers for the respective defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.\n\nPaul Hanly, a lawyer for the counties, said the plaintiffs were pleased that Polster \"almost uniformly\" agreed with their positions on the dismissal motions and whether various testimony should be admitted.\n\nPurdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, have been in talks on a possible $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims, two people familiar with the matter said last week.\n\nThat accord could include a bankruptcy filing for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.\n\nThe case is In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, No. 17-md-02804.
