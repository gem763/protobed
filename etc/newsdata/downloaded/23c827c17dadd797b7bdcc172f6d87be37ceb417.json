The jobless rate dropped to 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August, marking the lowest jobless rate since December 1969 when it also logged in at 3.5%.\n\nEconomists expected nonfarm payrolls were up 140,000 during the month, while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.\n\nInvestors are parsing the report for clues on the health of the world's largest economy during a period of global turbulence.\n\nThe report follows a disappointing stretch of data. Earlier this week, fresh data showed that U.S. factory activity contracted for a second straight month and hit a 10-year low. Meanwhile, the pace of private-sector job creation has been muted.\n\nMarket watchers will comb the jobs data for signs of weakness, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy moving forward. Towering concerns about U.S. and global growth have led investors to ramp up bets that the Fed will slash rates again this year after their two cuts in the third quarter.\n\nLater Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a Fed Listens event in Washington.\n\nAt a Wall Street Journal event in New York on Thursday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank will do what it takes to keep the longest period of U.S. economic expansion going. He added that the central bank takes each policy meeting \"one at a time.\"\n\nThe recent concerns about the economy have led to a shaky week for stocks. In one sign of the jitters percolating markets this week, the S&P 500 recorded its first back-to-back drops of 1% of the year. The index also gave up its entire third-quarter gain.\n\nEsty Dwek, a strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, said recent optimism that the global economy would pick up was fading. \"The world has had, if not expectations at least hopes, that we would see a bottom, \" Ms. Dwek said.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys edged u[ to 1.547% on Friday, from 1.531% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nIn premarket trading, HP shares dropped 3.8% after the computer hardware company said Thursday it would slash up to 9,000 jobs as part of its restructuring plan.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%, after suffering heavy losses earlier in the week.\n\nAmong the biggest gainers was oil-and-gas giant, BP. The stock gained 1.1% after chief executive Bob Dudley said he would retire next year.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei gained 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.1% after the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said that from Saturday a ban would be implemented on wearing masks at public gatherings, with penalties of up to a year in jail and a fine.\n\nThe ban could escalate tensions between the government and protesters, leading to more violent confrontations, according to Francis Lun, chief executive at Geo Securities. \"Investors should avoid Hong Kong-related stocks amid worsening social unrest,\" he said.\n\nStock markets in mainland China were closed on Friday.\n\nIn commodities, global oil benchmark Brent crude gained 0.7% to $58.09 a barrel. Gold edged up 0.1%.\n\nJoanne Chiu and Gunjan Banerji contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 08:54 ET (12:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
