I lost track of the number of times that I drilled myself with the grammar books or free apps for studying Japanese to the point that the key sentences for understanding each grammar point became a mantra that I\u2019d recite even in my sleep.\n\nZzzzzzz\u2026 \u305d\u306e \u554f\u984c \uff08 \u3082\u3093\u3060\u3044 \uff09 \u3092\u3081\u3050\u3063\u3066 \u8cdb\u5426 \uff08 \u3055\u3093\u3074 \uff09 \u304c \u5206 \uff08 \u308f \uff09 \u304b\u308c\u305f. Zzzzzzz\u2026 \u201cWe are divided on things surrounding this issue.\u201d\n\nLuckily a lot of these grammar points aren\u2019t necessarily found in seldom-used sentences like the one above.\n\nTake, for example, two grammar points that I struggled with which were: \uff5e \u5f97 \uff08 \u3048 \uff09 \u306a\u3044 and \uff5e\u305f\u3066.\n\nThese are often found in exam sentences like \u73fe\u5b9f \uff08 \u3052\u3093\u3058\u3064 \uff09 \u3067\u306f \u8d77 \uff08 \u304a \uff09 \u3053\u308a\u5f97\u306a\u3044 and \u5927\u5b66 \uff08 \u3060\u3044\u304c\u304f \uff09 \u3092 \u51fa \uff08 \u3067 \uff09 \u305f\u3066\u306e\u304a \u533b\u8005 \uff08 \u3044\u3057\u3083 \uff09 \u3055\u3093.\n\nBut how do you remember the meaning of sentences like this?\n\nOverheard in Japan\n\nIf you\u2019ve lived in Japan long enough you\u2019ve probably heard the term \u3042\u308a\u5f97\u306a\u3044 (Unbelievable!) overused to the point of redundancy.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t too much of a leap from that to remembering that \uff5e\u5f97\u306a\u3044 means (Cannot be done) and therefore working out the meaning of \u73fe\u5b9f\u3067\u306f\u8d77\u3053\u308a\u5f97\u306a\u3044 (That couldn\u2019t happen in reality).\n\nSimilarly, while learners may struggle with a tricky subject like \u5927\u5b66\u3092\u51fa\u305f\u3066\u306e\u304a\u533b\u8005\u3055\u3093 in a sentence, you probably wouldn\u2019t if you remembered \u713c \uff08 \u3084 \uff09 \u304d\u305f\u3066\u30d1\u30f3 \u2014the freshly baked bread that you come across every time you go to a bakery.\n\nImmediately, the meaning of \uff5e\u305f\u3066 (Just done) reveals itself and you can work out that \u5927\u5b66\u3092\u51fa\u305f\u3066\u306e\u304a\u533b\u8005\u3055\u3093 is used to describe a doctor who is freshly graduated from college.\n\nThis is one of the interesting things about this kind of grammar; it\u2019s all around us and by practicing it daily we can put ourselves on the road to mastery.\n\nConcentrating on small talk\n\nOne of the best ways that learners can master JLPT grammar it is by talking about every Japanese elderly guy\u2019s favorite small-talk topic: the weather.\n\nBelieve it or not, but this deceptively simple subject will help you master some of the trickiest grammar forms!\n\nSome of the most obvious examples of this are the grammar forms \uff5e\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a, \u3063\u307d\u3044, and \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 that confuse so many learners.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t need to be the case. When chatting about the weather, you should slip in terms like\n\n\u590f \uff08 \u306a\u3064 \uff09 \u3063\u307d\u3044 (It is very summery summer weather)\n\n(It is very summery summer weather) \u590f\u3089\u3057\u3044 (It is very summery weather except NOT in summer)\n\n(It is very summery weather except NOT in summer) \u590f\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a \u6691 \uff08 \u3042\u3064 \uff09 \u3055\u304c \u7d9a \uff08 \u3064\u3065 \uff09 \u304f (Heat like that in summer is continuing)\n\n\u2026 into your small talk to get daily exposure to the differences between these similar forms.\n\nEven some of the trickier grammar points can be used to talk about the weather: \u4eca\u591c \uff08 \u3053\u3093\u3084 \uff09 \u304b\u3089 \u660e\u65e5 \uff08 \u3042\u3057\u305f \uff09 \u306b\u304b\u3051\u3066 \u5168\u822c \uff08 \u305c\u3093\u3071\u3093 \uff09 \u306b \u66c7 \uff08 \u304f\u3082 \uff09 \u308a\u3084 \u96e8 \uff08 \u3042\u3081 \uff09 \u306e \u5929\u6c17 \uff08 \u3066\u3093\u304d \uff09 \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 (It will probably be generally cloudy and rainy weather over tonight and tomorrow) is a great way to practice the tricky form, \u306b\u304b\u3051\u3066 (spread over an area).\n\nSimilarly, listen out for phrases like \uff11\u9031\u9593 \uff08 \u3044\u3063\u3057\u3085\u3046\u304b\u3093 \uff09 \u96e8 \uff08 \u3042\u3081 \uff09 \u304c \u964d \uff08 \u3075 \uff09 \u308a\u3064\u3065\u304f\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b (It has been raining for a week) to practice \u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b grammar (Something that I have no control over is happening).\n\nWeather can also be used to practice the tricky A\u3046\u3061\u306bB (Before A happens, do B) grammar.\n\nGuys like me who value their beauty sleep will almost certainly never use the standard prep phrase \u967d \uff08 \u3072 \uff09 \u304c \u6607 \uff08 \u306e\u307c \uff09 \u3089\u306a\u3044\u3046\u3061\u306b \u51fa\u767a \uff08 \u3057\u3085\u3063\u3071\u3064 \uff09 \u3057\u3088\u3046 (Let\u2019s start before the sun rises).\n\nBut with the sort of baking hot summers that we get in Japan, \u6691 \uff08 \u3042\u3064 \uff09 \u304f\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3046\u3061\u306b \u51fa \uff08 \u3067 \uff09 \u304b\u3051\u3088\u3046 (Let\u2019s leave before it gets too hot) is definitely a useful phrase.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to also add phrases like \u96e8\u306f\u3084\u3080\u3069\u3053\u308d\u304b\u3044\u3088\u3044\u3088\u3072\u3069\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f (Far from stopping, the rain increased) into your daily repertoire in order to practice the tricky \u3069\u3053\u308d\u304b grammar (Far from ~).\n\nListen out for phrases that you hear at work\n\nRegardless of whether you work in a \u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u4e8c (convenience store), \u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71 \uff08 \u3048\u3044\u304b\u3044\u308f \uff09 (English-language school), or \u4f1a\u793e \uff08 \u304b\u3044\u3057\u3083 \uff09 (office) there are plenty of chances to practice the other N2 and N3 forms.\n\nThese simple meaningless phrases that you might mutter to your colleagues such as\n\n\u8ae6 \uff08 \u3042\u304d\u3089 \uff09 \u3081\u306a\u3044\u3067 (Don\u2019t give up!)\n\n(Don\u2019t give up!) \u6c17 \uff08 \u304d \uff09 \u306b\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3067 (Don\u2019t worry about it)\n\n(Don\u2019t worry about it) \u3084\u308a \u904e \uff08 \u3059 \uff09 \u304e\u306a\u3044\u3067 (Don\u2019t overdo it)\n\n\u2026 offer a chance to practice the \u306a\u3044\u3067 (Don\u2019t do~) and \u904e\u304e\u306a\u3044 (Don\u2019t do too much~) grammar forms daily.\n\n\u3070\u304b\u308a (Just done) is another one that is used a lot in office chat.\n\n\u4ed5\u4e0a \uff08 \u3057\u3042 \uff09 \u304c\u3063\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a (Just finished it) and \u79c1 \uff08 \u308f\u305f\u3057 \uff09 \u306f \u4eca\u7740 \uff08 \u3044\u307e\u3064 \uff09 \u3044\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3060 (I just arrived now) are both useful daily phrases.\n\nSimply the other use of \u3070\u3063\u304b\u308a (Nothing but) can be practiced in forms like:\n\n\u4e0a\u53f8 \uff08 \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3057 \uff09 \u306f \u5e30\u56fd \uff08 \u304d\u3053\u304f \uff09 \u3057\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3060 (The boss has just returned from abroad)\n\n(The boss has just returned from abroad) \u5f7c \uff08 \u304b\u308c \uff09 \u3089\u306f \u4e0d\u5e73 \uff08 \u3075\u3078\u3044 \uff09 \u3070\u304b\u308a \u8a00 \uff08 \u3044 \uff09 \u3046 (They do nothing but moan about things)\n\n(They do nothing but moan about things) \u8a00\u3044 \u8a33 \uff08 \u308f\u3051 \uff09 \u3070\u304b\u308a\u3059\u308b\u306a\u3088 (Don\u2019t just keep making excuses!).\n\nAnd hang on to phrases you use to complain about things\n\nGeneral grumblings can also be useful for practicing other forms such as \u304c\u3061 (Have a tendency to do something).\n\n\u5f7c\u306f \u9045\u523b \uff08 \u3061\u3053\u304f \uff09 \u3057\u304c\u3061\u3060 (He is apt to be late)\n\n(He is apt to be late) \u5f7c\u306f\u306a\u307e\u3051\u304c\u3061\u3067\u3042\u308b (He tends to be idle)\n\n(He tends to be idle) \u8a00\u3044\u8a33\u3092\u3057\u304c\u3061\u3060 (Apt to make excuses).\n\nThis can be practicing with other terms for tendencies such as \u6700\u8fd1 \uff08 \u3055\u3044\u304d\u3093 \uff09 \u98a8\u90aa \uff08 \u304b\u305c \uff09 \u304e\u307f and \u6700\u8fd1 \u592a \uff08 \u3075\u3068 \uff09 \u308a\u304e\u307f\u3060 followed by the inevitable \u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044 advice form:\n\n\u591c\u66f4 \uff08 \u3088\u3075 \uff09 \u304b\u3057\u306f\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044 (You must not stay up late)\n\n(You must not stay up late) \u98df \uff08 \u305f \uff09 \u3079\u3059\u304e\u306f\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044 (You shouldn\u2019t eat to excess).\n\nA related form is \u306a\u3044\u3067\u306f\u3044\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044 (I cannot help but~) that appears in sentences like \u79c1\u306f\u305d\u306e \u8001\u4eba \uff08 \u308d\u3046\u3058\u3093 \uff09 \u306b \u540c\u60c5 \uff08 \u3069\u3046\u3058\u3087\u3046 \uff09 \u3057\u306a\u3044\u3067\u306f\u3044\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044 (I cannot but feel sorry for the old man).\n\nIn addition, conflicts can be useful for practicing certain forms such as ~\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044 found in:\n\n\u8b1d \uff08 \u3042\u3084\u307e \uff09 \u308b\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044 (There is nothing to do but apologize)\n\n(There is nothing to do but apologize) \u5f85 \uff08 \u307e \uff09 \u3064\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044 (I can only wait)\n\n(I can only wait) \u5f7c\u306f \u6012 \uff08 \u304a\u3053 \uff09 \u308b\u3079\u304d\u3060 (He should be angry)\n\n(He should be angry) \u771f\u5b9f \uff08 \u3057\u3093\u3058\u3064 \uff09 \u3092\u3044\u3046\u3079\u304d\u3060 (You should tell the truth)\n\n(You should tell the truth) \u541b \uff08 \u304d\u307f \uff09 \u306f \u8b1d\u7f6a \uff08 \u3057\u3083\u3056\u3044 \uff09 \u3059\u3079\u304d\u3060 (You should apologize)\n\nHang in there!\n\nAnother common one that you will hear or use is the \uff5e\u3070\uff5e\u307b\u3069 (The more ~ the better). This can be tricky to say, so it is always worth practicing.\n\nYou might have heard \u65e9 \uff08 \u306f\u3084 \uff09 \u3051\u308c\u3070\u65e9\u3044\u307b\u3069 \u826f \uff08 \u3088 \uff09 \u3044 with means \u201cthe sooner, the better.\u201d\n\nThis can also be paired with \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b to make sentences like \u3059\u3050\u306b \u51fa\u6765 \uff08 \u3067\u304d \uff09 \u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b (You will soon be able to do it) and \u82f1\u8a9e \uff08 \u3048\u3044\u3054 \uff09 \u3092 \u8a71 \uff08 \u306f\u306a \uff09 \u305b\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046 (You will be able to speak English).\n\nAnother thing you\u2019ll soon be able to do? Pass the JLPT! While all of these won\u2019t be useful every single day, these examples show that a lot of everyday phrases contain the kernels of the larger, more difficult ideas that come up in the test.\n\nAnd as that other common phrase goes: \u201cEvery little helps!\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Coslett", "Amelie Marie Nishizawa", "Mike Kozlowski"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/Common-Phrases-JLPT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
