They also backed the development of an alternative public cryptocurrency in Europe.\n\nThe criticism comes as the European Central Bank is working on a long-term plan to launch a public digital currency that could make projects such as Libra redundant.\n\nOn Tuesday, ECB board member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said stablecoins like Facebook\u2019s Libra highlighted gaps in rules, adding that the media giant\u2019s payments project faced a tough regulatory approach.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Libra is in close contact with European regulators such as Germany\u2019s financial markets watchdog Bafin to sound out regulatory hurdles.\n\n\u201cWe are in intensive discussions with Libra,\u201d Bafin president Felix Hufeld told reporters last week, adding that some complicated questions still had to be addressed.\n\n\u201cWe have asked questions, we have received responses. Very specific questions, less detailed answers,\u201d Hufeld said.\n\nThis showed that many questions of high economic relevance had not been thought through completely yet by the Libra people themselves, Hufeld added.", "description": "Germany has passed a comprehensive blockchain strategy in which Berlin vows to fight any company efforts to establish a parallel currency, in the latest sign that Facebook's planned Libra faces tough regulatory hurdles in Europe.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
