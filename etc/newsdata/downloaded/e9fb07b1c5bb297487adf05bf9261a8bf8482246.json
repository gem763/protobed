REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a demand by the country\u2019s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that wireless carriers pay nearly $13 in overdue levies and interest.\n\nIt also asked telecom companies to deposit the outstanding amount within three months, according to a copy of the order seen by Reuters.\n\nVodafone Idea and rival Bharti Airtel Ltd reported losses for the quarter to June, hit by a price war that began after conglomerate Reliance Industries launched its Jio telecoms arm in 2016 with free voice and cut-price data services.\n\n\u201cThe judgment has financial implications, which we are reviewing,\u201d Vodafone Idea said in a statement. \u201cWe will engage with the DoT in order for it to consider granting relief, including a waiver of interest and penalties.\u201d\n\nBoth Vodafone Idea and Bharti sparred for over a decade with the DoT over the definition of so-called adjusted gross revenue (AGR), a percentage of which they pay as usage charges for spectrum or airwaves and as licence fees.\n\nThe companies maintained that AGR should comprise only revenue accrued from core services and not other revenue such as income from the sale of mobile phones, income from rent of property or the sale of scrap.\n\nThe Supreme Court however upheld the DoT\u2019s view that all revenue be included in AGR.\n\nOn Friday, shares in Vodafone Idea closed 5.6% lower, while Bharti gained 0.8% in a broader Mumbai market that ended flat.\n\nVodafone Idea will be the worst hit given its already stretched balance sheet, local brokerage ICICI Securities said.\n\nThe company, a combination of Britain\u2019s Vodafone Group Plc and local Idea Cellular, made a consolidated net loss of 48.74 billion rupees ($687.68 million) in the quarter to June, and had gross debt of 1.2 trillion rupees.\n\nBharti Airtel, which owes over 216 billion rupees to the DoT, reported a net loss of 28.66 billion rupees at the end of the June quarter, while net debt was 1.17 trillion rupees.\n\nBharti could scrape through making the overdue payments, but Vodafone Idea \u201cis estimated to require additional capital to fund even the current operations beyond the next 3-4 quarters,\u201d local brokerage Motilal Oswal said.\n\nThe court ruling will have limited impact on Jio as it started operations in late 2016, compared with rivals whose outstanding dues, interest and penalties have been mounting for over 10 years.", "description": "Loss-making Indian mobile carrier Vodafone Idea said on Friday it will ask the central government for relief on payments of at least $4 billion after a court ruling required it to pay overdue levies and interest.", "authors": ["Sankalp Phartiyal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444940673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1K2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
