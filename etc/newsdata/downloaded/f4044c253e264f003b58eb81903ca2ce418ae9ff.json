REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nShares in RBS were down 2.4% at 0820 GMT after the state-backed bank reported an 8 million pound pre-tax loss in the three months to end-September, compared to a 961 million pound profit for the same period last year.\n\nRose is due to head a new-look management team from next month at RBS, which made a fresh 900 million pound ($1.16 billion) provision to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) on loans and credit cards.\n\nBritish banks were stung by a late surge in PPI queries ahead of an August claims deadline, sending the industry\u2019s final compensation bill above 43 billion pounds.\n\n\u201cIt would be a very brave FD (financial director) who said the line was completely drawn under it,\u201d RBS Chief Financial Officer Katie Murray told reporters.\n\nThe charge was at the top of a 600-900 million pound range forecast by RBS in September and knocked the bank\u2019s core capital ratio by 50 basis points to 15.7%.\n\nRose will have to tackle its investment banking arm, which posted a loss of 193 million pounds, with total income dropping by 419 million pounds to 150 million pounds compared with a year ago.\n\nJoe Dickerson, analyst at Jefferies, said the performance of NatWest Markets was \u201cdeplorable\u201d and Rose would come under pressure to further restructure the overall business\n\nRBS said the unit suffered heavily during August and September, when borrowing costs in U.S. overnight lending markets soared and investors grappled with global recession signals, trade tensions and the threat of a chaotic Brexit.\n\nMurray said she could not rule out further restructuring of the business, but wider cuts would be a decision for Rose.\n\nNEW DIRECTION\n\nRose, an RBS veteran who will become the first woman to lead one of Britain\u2019s big four banks, will outline her new strategy in February.\n\nShe inherits a smaller bank that returned to profit and paying a dividend under predecessor Ross McEwan, who will become CEO of National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) in December.\n\nBig challenges facing Rose include accelerating the return of the majority state-owned bank to private hands and stepping up distributions of excess capital to investors.\n\nShareholders have called on RBS to radically pare back its investment banking activities to concentrate on higher-returning businesses.\n\nWhile mortgage lending grew to 8.6 billion pounds in the quarter, up from 6.7 billion pounds three months earlier, RBS blamed intensifying competition for squeezing its net interest margin by 5 basis points to 1.97%.\n\nRBS had in August ditched its profitability and cost targets for next year due and Murray said business borrowers were continuing to delay investment decisions.\n\nThe bank posted 213 million pounds of impairments for the quarter, above expectations.\n\nInvestor sentiment towards Britain\u2019s lenders has recently improved as the chances of a disorderly Brexit have receded, boosting bank share prices including RBS by around 15% for the year to date.\n\n($1 = 0.7743 pounds)\n\n(Refiles to fix typographical errors, paragraphs 7-8)", "description": "Royal Bank of Scotland highlighted the challenges facing its new chief executive Alison Rose on Thursday as a weak performance at its investment bank NatWest Markets and yet another mis-selling charge tipped it into a third-quarter loss.", "authors": ["Iain Withers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444389562&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0DG", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
