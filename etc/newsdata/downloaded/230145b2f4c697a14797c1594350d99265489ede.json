In many ways, the ones that have been created organically are my favourite.

Do we think only 2 per cent of good ideas come from women? \u2014 Pip Marlow, Salesforce ANZ CEO\n\nMs Marlow, who recently joined Salesforce, was previously the local managing director of Microsoft and head of innovation at Suncorp. She said gender equality in the tech industry was improving, but there was some way to go in engaging men on the issue and unlocking equal access to capital.\n\nNaomi Simson says connecting with others is not just about improving one's career. Karleen Minney\n\n\"I think most industries have challenges and double standards. However, I believe one of the biggest in tech or more broadly in the start-up world is access to capital. Why is it only 2 per cent of venture capital funding is going to female-led start-ups? Do we think only 2 per cent of good ideas come from women?\" she asked.\n\n\"Women are starting and leading businesses more than ever before and we need to ensure they have access to the same funding and opportunities as their male counterparts.\"\n\nSerial entrepreneur Ms Simson, co-founder of The Big Red Group, which deals in gifting experiences, said she leaned on various female mentors for advice during her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo nuggets of wisdom stood out for her.\n\nFormer chief executive of Westpac in New Zealand Ann Sherry told Ms Simson when her children were young, to enjoy them but also to remember to invest in herself because one day her children would leave.\n\n\"She said: 'I know your kids are young now, and it's really difficult, but they will grow up. And your job is to stay connected so that you can contribute.' And now my kids are grown up, and she was right!\" Ms Simson said.\n\nShe has also found a mentor in Carol Schwartz, a business leader, property heavyweight, and campaigner for women.\n\n\"She's very much challenged me to be a role model for others and to make sure that I am dragging other ones with me,\" Ms Simson said.\n\nMs Schwartz encouraged Ms Simson to appear on Australian television show Shark Tank as one of the \"sharks\" grilling would-be entrepreneurs about their business ideas. Appearing on television would allow her to be a role model for women in business among a far broader audience than just the executives and employees she regularly brushed shoulders with, Ms Schwartz told her.\n\nMs Simson said that connecting with others was not just about improving one's career, but also about inspiring others.", "description": "Female-only networks are one way women are challenging stereotypes and double standards that still permeate the business world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3998%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_391%2C$y_143/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/efc71f4c4deafce60c1fc1015b31c97d0cd6bcb3", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
