Roosevelt in the 1930s. Among college graduates, 12 percent selected Rep. Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nMoreover, 26 percent of respondents selected Brett Kavanaugh as the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, while 14 percent selected Antonin Scalia, who passed away in 2016. Among those respondents, 15 percent of college graduates selected Brett Kavanaugh, with less than half of respondents correctly selecting John Roberts.\n\nThe survey, entitled, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Knowledge Crisis: A Survey on Civic Literacy,\u201d also noted that 63 percent of respondents did not know the term lengths of U.S. Senators and Representatives, with less than half of college graduates selecting the correct answer.\n\nAdditionally, an alarming 12 percent of respondents surveyed understood the relationship between the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, with only 19 percent of college graduates selecting the correct answer.\n\n\u201cColleges have the responsibility to prepare students for a lifetime of informed citizenship,\u201d said the president of ACTA, Michael Poliakoff. \u201cOur annual What Will They Learn? report illustrates the steady deterioration of the core curriculum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen American history and government courses are removed, you begin to see disheartening survey responses like these, and America\u2019s experiment in self-government begins to slip from our grasp.\u201d he added.\n\nACTA says that its annual What Will They Learn? report, \u201cuniquely assesses the core academic requirements at 1,123 four-year institutions that together enroll more than eight million undergraduate students,\u201d and that it scores the institutions based on whether they require all students to take courses in seven \u201cpriority subject areas.\u201d\n\nAccording to the organization, only 22 institutions earned an \u201cA\u201d for core curriculum requirements, and 137 schools failed. \u201cWhile most universities require students to take courses in composition and the natural sciences, curricular gaps are common everywhere else,\u201d said ACTA in a statement.\n\n82% do not require students to take a foundational course in U.S. government or history.\n\n43% do not require students to take a college-level mathematics course.\n\n68% do not require students to study literature.\n\n88% do not require intermediate-level foreign language courses.\n\n97% do not require a course in economics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that public confidence in higher education is falling,\u201d said Poliakoff. \u201cAmidst all the fanfare about the release of the latest college rankings this week, there is not a peep about ill-informed citizens, often underprepared for the workforce, who are graduating from our colleges and universities with mountains of student debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy focusing on resource inputs, admissions selectivity, and institutional reputation, the major rankings systems drive costs up but show little interest in what students learn \u2014 or don\u2019t learn,\u201d he added.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "College graduates are responsible, in part, for a \"knowledge crisis\" regarding basic civic literacy in the United States, according to a recent survey that revealed \"alarming results.\" For example, less than half of college graduates surveys knew the term lengths of U.S. Senators and Representatives.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/college-students-graduation-cap-for-hire-job-file-photo-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
