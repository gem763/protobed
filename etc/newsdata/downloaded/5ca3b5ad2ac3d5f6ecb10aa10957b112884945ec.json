The first, What Pet Should I Get?, was released in 2015. Now, the second book, Dr. Seuss's Horse Museum, has been brought to life thanks to the author's longtime art director and publisher, Cathy Goldsmith.\n\nWith a horse as your guide, the book takes readers through the history of horse art from ancient Chinese art to the Italian Renaissance to modernism, and includes full-colour photographic reproductions of the artwork.\n\nGoldsmith joined q's Tom Power from New York to talk about the miraculous discovery of the manuscript and Dr. Seuss's somewhat secret life as a painter.\n\nPrevious Next\n\nDr. Seuss's Horse Museum is out now. Later this month, a touring interactive exhibition called The Dr. Seuss Experience will debut at Square One in Mississauga, Ont. before making its way to other, yet-to-be-announced North American cities.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bCora Nijhawan\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the conversation.", "description": "Theodor Seuss Geisel Dr. Seuss's longtime art director on bringing the author's posthumous book Dr. Seuss's Horse Museum to life", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309509.1570217027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dr-seuss-s-horse-museum.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
