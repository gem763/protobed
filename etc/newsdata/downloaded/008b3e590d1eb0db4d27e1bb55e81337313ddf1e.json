The elements of the old law that were overturned or modified will come back into effect if lawmakers do not pass an alternative proposal by Dec. 31, the court ruled.\n\nThe government has not supplied a calculation of the fiscal impact of the court's decision. It is targeting a deficit of 2.2% of gross domestic product next year, down from 2.4% this year.\n\nFinance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla warned recently that a decision to overturn the law could affect investor confidence and bring lower growth for Colombia's $350 billion economy.\n\n\"If it is not upheld, no one will believe again. The effect is permanent and in present circumstances is worth about a point and a half of GDP growth each year,\" Carrasquilla said.\n\nThe head of the tax agency said the government would propose a new law to keep benefits for businesses and raise the resources required for the budget if the reform was overturned.
