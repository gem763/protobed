The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.,\" said Donald Tusk, the European Council president, on Twitter.\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, the UK will be able to terminate the extension at any point provided parliament ratifies the withdrawal agreement and leaves with a deal.\n\nIt represents an embarrassing climbdown for the prime minister, who made a \"do or die\" pledge to take Britain out of the EU on October 31.\n\nHe was forced to send a letter to Brussels requesting an extension earlier in October after parliament passed a law compelling him to accept an extension if he was not able to ratify his deal in parliament by October 19. The move was designed to ensure Johnson was unable to force a no-deal Brexit on October 31 without the approval of parliament.\n\nIt comes after the House of Commons voted in favour of the legislation required to deliver Brexit but declined to support Johnson's attempt to fast-track it through parliament in October, meaning he was legally required to request an extension.\n\nFocus will now turn to whether MPs approve Johnson's request for a general election on Monday evening. The vote, to be made under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, would require a two-thirds Commons majority of 434 MPs, looks likely to fail because Labour has not backed it.", "description": "The EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until at least next year after Boris Johnson was forced reluctantly to seek an extension.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6ae54dee01911e3398825?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
