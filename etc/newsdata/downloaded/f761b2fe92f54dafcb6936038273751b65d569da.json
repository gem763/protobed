But he does offer some personal ones, from his transformation into America\u2019s most famous secret-spiller, to the news that he was married, two years ago, to Lindsay Mills, the girlfriend he left behind when he fled the U.S. for Hong Kong with a virtual library of top secret files detailing America\u2019s global electronic spying apparatus.\n\nAfter enlisting in the Army at 21, Snowden writes that he was on a track called \u201c18 X-Ray\u201d, with a chance to come out of training as a Special Forces sergeant, before breaking his leg at Fort Benning and receiving an administrative separation.\n\n\u201cI had hoped to serve my country,\u201d he writes, as his family had before him, \u201cbut instead I went to work for it\u201d as a contractor for the intelligence community. That was effectively a cover, in his telling, as \u201cthe agencies were hiring tech companies to hire kids, and then giving them the keys to the kingdom because\u2026 no one else knew how the keys, or the kingdom worked.\u201d He elaborates: \u201cHere is one thing that the disorganized CIA didn\u2019t quite understand at the time, and that no major American employed outside of Silicon Valley understood, either: The computer guy knows everything, or rather can know everything.\u201d\n\nEventually, Snowden, having attained the security clearances necessary for his tech work, \u201cwent govvy\u201d and signed up for a straight CIA job. He joined class 6-06 of the BTTP, or the Basic Telecommunications Training Program that \u201cdisguises one of the most classified and unusual curricula in existence\u2026 to train TISOs (Technical Information Security Officers),\u201d who work under State Department cover to \u201cmanage the technical infrastructure for CIA operations, most commonly hidden at stations inside American missions, consulates, and embassies.\u201d \u201c[T]he worst-kept secret in modern diplomacy is that the primary function of an embassy nowadays is to serve as a platform for espionage,\u201d he writes.\n\nAfter being stationed in Vienna, Snowden moved to Tokyo in 2009 to work as a systems analyst for the NSA, he writes, though nominally as an employee of Dell. \u201cTwo things about the NSA stunned me right off the bat: how technologically sophisticated it was compared with the CIA, and how much less vigilant it was about security in its every iteration,\u201d he writes, noting that the NSA \u201chardly bothered to encrypt anything.\u201d\n\nWhile working there on a project called EPICSHELTER \u2014 \u201ca backup and storage system that would act as a shadow NSA: a complete, automated, and constantly updating copy of all the agency\u2019s most important material, which would allow the agency to reboot and be up and running again, with all its archives intact, even if Fort Meade were reduced to smoldering rubble\u201d \u2014 Snowden began researching China\u2019s domestic surveillance system, which led to his first inkling that if such systems were possible, the U.S. might be using them too, given \u201cperhaps the fundamental rule of technological progress:. if something can be done, it probably will be done, and possibly already has been.\u201d\n\nThat same summer, the U.S. released its Unclassified Report on the President\u2019s Surveillance Program, following the New York Times\u2019 reporting on the Bush-era warrantless wiretapping program. Eventually, Snowden writes, he found the classified version, \u201cfiled in an Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) compartment, an extremely rare classification used to make sure something would remain hidden even from those holding top secret clearance\u2026 The report\u2019s full classification designation was TOP SECRET//STLW//HCS//COMINT//ORCORN//NOFORN, which translates to: pretty much only a few dozen people in the world are allowed the read this.\u201d\n\nSnowden found it only because the STLW classification \u2014 for STELLARWIND \u2014 had raised a red flag for him as a system administrator, meaning he had to examine the file to determine what it was and how best to scrub it from the system where it wasn\u2019t supposed to have been placed.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that the unclassified version I was already familiar with wasn\u2019t a redaction of the classified report, as would usually be the practice,\u201d he writes. \u201cRather, it was a wholly different document, which the classified version immediately exposed as an outright and carefully concocted lie\u201d to hide the transformation of the NSA\u2019s mission \u201cfrom using technology to defend America to using technology to control it by redefining citizens\u2019 private Internet communications as potential signals intelligence.\u201d\n\nSTELLARWIND, the classified report revealed, had been collecting communications in the U.S. since 2001, and continued even after Justice Department lawyers secretly objected to it in 2004. It\u2019s longevity owed everything to a kafkaesque legal position adopted by the Bush administration, \u201cthat the NSA could collect whatever communication records it wanted to, without having to get a warrant, because it could only be said to have acquired or obtained them, in the legal sense, if and when the agency \u2018searched and retrieved\u2019 them from its database.\u201d\n\nHaving found the big secret, set up so that no one else knew it was there to even start asking questions, Snowden writes, he began using his access as a systems engineer and administrator to ask those questions, while keeping the knowledge a secret from his girlfriend and his family, and considering what to do about it.\n\nBack in the US in 2011, Snowden experienced his first epileptic seizure. The following year on a contract with Dell again, he returned to the NSA, at its Kunia Regional Security Operations Center in Hawaii. There, he writes, \u201cmy active searching out of NSA abuses began not with the copying of documents, but with the reading of them.\u201d\n\nAs the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, he was developing an automated \u201creadboard\u201d to scan the IC\u2019s own internal internet and create a custom digital magazine for each employee, based on his or her interests and security clearances. He called the system Heartbeat, and its servers stored a copy of each scanned document, \u201cmaking it easy for me to perform the kind of deep interagency searches that the heads of most agencies could only dream of.\u201d Heartbeat, he writes, \u201cwas the source of nearly all of the documents that I later disclosed to journalists.\u201d\n\nSnowden mentions a rare public speech Ira \u201cGus\u201d Hunt, the CIA\u2019s chief technology officer, delivered a week after then Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had lied to Congress about the NSA\u2019s collection of bulk communications. In the speech, covered only by the Huffington Post, Hunt flatly declared that we \u201ctry to collect everything and hang on to it forever.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re already a walking sensor platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is nearly within our grasp to be able to compute on all human generated information\u201d). As Snowden notes, a video of the talk has less than 1,000 views.\n\nAfter that, Snowden recounts his efforts to reach out to journalists, and to carefully hide his digital breadcrumbs by encrypting data and distributing the keys to it, while perhaps hiding his findings on SD cards inside of Rubik\u2019s Cube cubes to get them out of the NSA\u2019s underground tunnel in Hawaii.\n\nHe then took what he saw as a less prestigious new position to gain access to the XKEYSCORE system, which he\u2019d learned about but not used himself, and, he writes, is \u201cperhaps best understood as a search engine that lets an analyst search through the records of your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, simply put, the closest thing to science fiction I\u2019ve ever seen in science fact,\u201d he writes, allowing users to put in someone\u2019s basic information and then go through their online history, even playing back recordings of their online settings and watching people as they searched, character by character. \u201cEveryone\u2019s communications were in the system\u2014everyone\u2019s,\u201d including the president\u2019s, he writes. The potential for abuse was obvious. NSA workers even had a word, \u201cLOVEINT\u201d for \u201clove intelligence,\u201d to describe analysts cyber-stalking current, former and prospective lovers, while among male analysts \u201cintercepted nudes were a kind of informal office currency,\u201d Snowden writes. \u201cThis was how you knew you could trust each other: you had shared in one another\u2019s crimes.\u201d\n\nFinally, Snowden recounts his trip to Hong Kong, after taking a medical leave, his efforts to reach Ecuador, and his exile in Russia, where he was finally reunited with Lindsay (whose diary entries recounting his disappearance, and the pressure then placed on her by U.S. authorities are given a full, moving chapter.\n\nSnowden speaks well of a very different leaker, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, writing that while \u201cpeople have long ascribed selfish motives to Assange\u2019s desire to give me aid, I believe he was genuinely motivated in one thing above all\u2014helping me evade capture\u2026 It\u2019s true that Assange can be self-interested and vain, moody, and even bullying \u2014 after a sharp disagreement just a month after our first, text-based communication, I never communicated with him again\u2014but he also sincerely conceives of himself as a fighter in a historic battle for the public\u2019s right to know, a battle he will do anything to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost important to [Assange],\u201d writes Snowden, \u201dwas the opportunity to establish a counter-example to the case of the organization\u2019s most famous source, US Army Private Chelsea Manning, whose thirty-five-year prison sentence was historically unprecedented and a monstrous deterrent to whistleblowers everywhere.\u201d", "description": "In a few months, he laid bare some of America\u2019s most highly-classified electronic espionage programs.
