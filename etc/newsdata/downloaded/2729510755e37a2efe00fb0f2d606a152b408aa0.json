The Ifo institute cut its 2019 growth forecast for Germany on Thursday, predicting a recession in the third quarter.\n\n\"On balance, this round of ECB policy easing is seen as generally growth-supportive at the margin, but may not significantly move the growth dial,\" said Selena Ling, Head of Strategy and Research at OCBC.\n\nTrade-reliant commodity-linked and automotive stocks were boosted by fresh indications that a prolonged trade war between the United States and China was thawing.\n\nAfter Beijing and Washington made tariff concessions to each other, U.S. President Donald Trump said he could consider an interim trade deal with China ahead of high-level negotiations in October.\n\nThe food & beverage index was the biggest decliner on the STOXX 600 as investors continued to rotate out of defensive stocks.\n\nRoche Holding was the biggest boost to the index as it reported positive data from a primary progressive MS (PPMS) study.\n\nFrench conglomerate Bollore Group was also among the best performers after posting a 27% increase in first-half core earnings.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG rose 1.6% after becoming the first of 16 financial services companies to resolve claims that it conspired to rig prices of bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sagarika Jaisinghani in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)", "description": "ECB chief Mario Draghi told governments to do more to revive an ailing euro zone economy as he cut rates deeper into negative territory and pledged indefinite monetary stimulus, tying the hands of his successor for years to come and initially driving stock markets higher.
