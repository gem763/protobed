He said it is the job of Congress to update the law, not the justice system.\n\nBut advocates for sexual minority groups argue that the rights of the LGBTQ community have advanced first and foremost through the court system in recent years, most notably with the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, this is more fundamental than what was at stake\u201d in the same-sex marriage case, said Ria Tabacco Mar of the powerful American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the ability to earn a living, the ability to support our families, the ability to secure a safe place to live. I mean, this goes to the very heart of what it is to live and work in this country.\u201d\n\nOnly 22 states forbid discrimination against sexual minorities in the workplace. Tabacco Mar said it was up to the Supreme Court to stop the LGBTQ community from being \u201crelegated to second class status.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cEnough is enough\u201d \u2013\n\nThe Supreme Court will start by hearing the cases of Donald Zarda and Gerald Lynn Bostock.\n\nThe former, a skydiving instructor from New York, was sacked after jokingly reassuring a female client whom he was strapping to himself for a jump that he was gay. He died in a base-jumping accident in 2014, but his family have pursued the case.\n\nThe second case is of a social worker from Georgia who was sacked shortly after joining a gay sports team.\n\nZarda\u2019s dismissal was overturned by a court while Bostock\u2019s was upheld, and the difference in interpretation of the law prompted the intervention by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court\u2019s nine justices will then examine the case, for the first time in public, of a transgender person.\n\nBorn a boy 58 years ago, Aimee Stephens worked for a Detroit funeral home for six years before telling her employer she wanted to be issued a female uniform. Two weeks later, she was fired, with the boss saying: \u201cThis is not going to work.\u201d\n\nThe boss, Thomas Rost, cited his Christian values in defending his decision and the need to avoid upsetting customers in mourning.\n\nDistraught, Stephens decided to fight. \u201cIt was time that somebody stood up and said enough is enough,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery human being deserves the same rights. That\u2019s all we are asking for.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Too early\u2019 \u2013\n\nSince its landmark decision on gay marriage, the court has swung to the right with Trump\u2019s appointment of two conservative judges, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFor lawyer Tom Goldstein, who has often argued cases at the Supreme Court, Stephens\u2019 case has probably come \u201ctoo early\u201d before the body, which is unlikely to accept a broader reading of the 1964 law.\n\n\u201cIn 20 years, I think it\u2019s going to be pretty inconceivable socially, that we will think that the discrimination against gays and lesbians and transgender individuals is legal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we are in a kind of transitional period. And I think that the conservatives, as a result, are more likely to take a more traditional view of the statute,\u201d he said.\n\nEmployers have also received support from conservatives and religious groups.\n\nCatholic bishops wrote an amicus brief to the court warning that \u201cordinary religious believers, whose views about marriage and human sexuality do not conform to those of the present culture, will be silenced or punished for \u2018unwelcome\u2019 speech on these subjects, which now will be regarded as a form of harassment.\u201d\n\nThe conservative group \u201cAlliance Defending Freedom,\u201d which successfully backed a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple and whose case ended up before the Supreme Court, has also weighed in on the side of employers.\n\nWorkers who feel their rights have been infringed upon can count on the support of many advocacy groups, including the ACLU, and the backing of Democratic politicians.\n\nThe two sides will find themselves face to face Tuesday when rival demonstrations are set to be held outside the court as the hearings get under way.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Does a US employer have the right to sack a worker because they are gay or transgender?
