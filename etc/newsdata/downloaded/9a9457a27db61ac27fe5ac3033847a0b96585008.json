At the FOMC's last policy announcement, he said the Fed may have to \"resume organic growth of the balance sheet.\" Powell's exact message behind that sentence is up for interpretation, but what we do know is the Fed won't hesitate to expand their operations \u2014 a practice known as quantitative easing, or QE \u2014 in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn fact, it already appears to be happening. After a steady decline, the FOMC has recently added hundreds of billions of dollars to their balance sheet to address liquidity concerns and keep interest rates within their preferred range. And many believe this could just be the beginning.\n\nThe graph below depicts a recent increase in the Fed's assets after an extended period of contraction.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)\n\nThat capital addition is an important distinction \u2014 and Gayed thinks that if the Fed continues to inject stimulus into the system, the subsequent action in the bond market won't be pretty.\n\n\"You could very easily see the mother of all corrections in the bond market here,\" he said. \"I suspect you're going to have traditional behavior in the bond market take place, which means that every time the Fed has enacted some kind of balance sheet expansion \u2014 some kind of QE \u2014 the bond market sold off.\"\n\nThat's a bit of an anomaly. After all, quantitative easing (QE) is supposed to lower interest rates by adding liquidy to the system.\n\nBut Gayed says the opposite is true \u2014 and he has the data to back this up.\n\nThe chart below depicts the US 10-year's performance in periods of quantitative easing. Remember, bond price and yield have an inverse relationship, so the spikes higher represent selloffs.\n\nReal Vision, Michael Gayed\n\nThe relationship is undeniable. When QE is enacted, bonds violently selloff.\n\nWhat's more, he sees the \"tremendous bullishness and complacency\" currently baked into the bond market making the nose-dive even worse.\n\nBut not all hope is lost \u2014 and Gayed thinks certain sectors of the market will benefit from debt's demise.\n\n\"When you look at financials\u2014 which would benefit off of yield curve steepening in the US \u2014 they're starting to improve,\" he said. \"If you look at EUFN\u2014 which is the European financials ETF \u2014 also starting to look like it's starting to improve.\"", "description": "Michael Gayed breaks down why there's trouble ahead for the bond market if the Fed continues to inject capital into the system.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5adf8cb619ee8652008b47f5-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
