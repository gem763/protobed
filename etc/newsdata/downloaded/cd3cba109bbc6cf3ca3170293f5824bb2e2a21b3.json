And no, the caliphate would not have been destroyed without the Kurds.'\n\n'To say to the American people that ISIS has been destroyed in Syria is not true,' he insisted.\n\nBut in a call in August with pranksters Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, who faked a call pretending to be Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, Graham said: 'Your YPG Kurdish problem is a big problem.\n\n'I told President Trump that Obama made a huge mistake in relying on the YPG Kurds Everything I worried about has come true, and now we have to make sure Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria. I'm sympathetic to the YPG problem, and so is the president, quite frankly.'\n\nLindsey Graham has fallen victim to Russian prank callers pretending to be the Turkish defense minister, telling them the Kurds are a 'threat'.

That's exactly what he wants.'\n\nSpokesman for the South Carolina senator, Kevin Bishop, told Politico: 'We have been successful in stopping many efforts to prank Senator Graham and the office, but this one slipped through the cracks. They got him.'\n\nBishop added: 'It's no secret Senator Graham has often traveled to Turkey and continued to speak with many members of Turkish government, including President Erdogan, about the relationship between our two countries.\n\n'He has been clear he wants a stronger relationship and often talked about the importance of maintaining peace in northern Syria to prevent the reemergence of ISIS.\n\n'With Turkey's invasion into northern Syria the drive for better relations between our two countries has suffered a body blow. Turkey should immediately withdraw their military forces and America should reinstitute the safe zone concept to keep the peace in the region. Until this is done, Senator Graham will continue to push for severe, biting sanctions against Turkey.'\n\nU.S. Republicans rushed to condemn Trump's Syria policy on Wednesday after Turkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters, a rare break from the White House that had some calling for 'devastating' sanctions against the NATO ally\n\nGraham spoke with pranksters Alexey Stolyarov, right, and Vladimir Kuznetsov, left, twice\n\nIn the chat with the pranksters, who are known as Lexus and Vovan, Graham spends much of the call talking about F-35 program and Russia\u2019s S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system.\n\nHe also mentions the case of international gold trader who was a client of Rudolph Giuliani, Reza Zarrab.\n\nTrump pressured then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017 to interfere in a Justice Department prosecution of the international gold trader, according to a new report.\n\nGraham said of Trump: 'And this case involving the Turkish bank, he's very sensitive to that. The president wants to be helpful, within the limits of his power.'\n\nHe adds: 'I like President Erdogan. I think President Trump likes President Erdogan. I think he's a strong man and we need to deal with strong people.'\n\nU.S. Republicans rushed to condemn Trump's Syria policy on Wednesday after Turkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters, a rare break from the White House that had some calling for 'devastating' sanctions against the NATO ally.\n\nGraham unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nTheir proposed sanctions would target the assets of senior officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, mandate sanctions over Turkey's purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system and impose visa restrictions.\n\nThey also would sanction anyone who conducted military transactions with Turkey or supported energy production for use by its armed forces, bar U.S. military assistance to Turkey and require a report on Erdogan's net worth and assets.\n\nThe senator publicly condemned Trump's decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria\n\n'I am pleased to have reached a bipartisan agreement with Senator Van Hollen on severe sanctions against Turkey for their invasion of Syria,' Graham said in a statement.\n\n'While the Administration refuses to act against Turkey, I expect strong bipartisan support,' he said.\n\nThe Turkish military and Syrian rebel allies launched an operation in Syria on Wednesday with air strikes. Erdogan said the operation aimed to eliminate a 'terror corridor' along the Turkish border.\n\nIn an interview with the media outlet Axios, Graham said: 'The president's doing this completely against everybody else's advice. He will get 100% of the credit if he knows something the rest of us don't. And he's going to get 100% of the blame. There'll be no middle ground.'\n\nIn a statement on Twitter on Tuesday, Graham warned Ankara of 'sanctions from hell' if it moved into northern Syria.
