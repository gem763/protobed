My partner won\u2019t fly but we would like to visit Pompeii and Herculaneum. Is there an alternative way to travel?\n\nBrenda Wise, Kent\n\nYou can get to Pompeii by train but it could take over 17 hours, advises the Holiday Guru\n\nA. You could go by train but it takes 17 hours and 23 minutes if booked via en.oui.sncf. Catch the 5.40am train from St Pancras to Paris, change for a service to Turin and then for another to Naples and arrive at 11.28pm. The one-way fare is \u00a3206. It may be preferable to break the journey with an overnight stay in Turin, which you reach at 4.20pm on the 5.40am train. If you take the more humane 10.24am from St Pancras you arrive in Turin at 8.18pm (\u00a3147); see raileurope.com. Turin to Naples takes six hours and there are regular departures (\u00a346).\n\nQ. I am an 83-year-old man who travels to Thailand three times a year from Manchester Airport. My problem is getting from the train station to the terminals with my suitcase as I have arthritis in both knees. Is there a way I can get some help?\n\nRonald Spackman, via email\n\nA Yes. Call your airline, explain your predicament and tell them what time your train arrives. The airline will arrange for an \u2018assistance provider\u2019 to meet you at the station\u2019s \u2018assistance point\u2019 and take you to your terminal, free of charge. Station staff will help you from the train to the \u2018assistance point\u2019. Allow at least 48 hours advance warning before your flight.\n\nTravelling to Cuba does not disqualify you from visiting America, says the Holiday Guru\n\nQ. We have booked a holiday to Cuba in February. Then, four months later, we will be visiting the United States. Will there be any problems with our passports or ESTAs?\n\nScilla Ashdown, via email\n\nA. No. Travelling to Cuba does not disqualify you from visiting America, despite the nations\u2019 political differences. You can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation) as usual at esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta. See the \u2018entry requirements\u2019 section of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u2019s website, which lists countries that could cause problems: gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa.\n\nWE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU\n\nThe Holiday Guru is here to answer your questions.
