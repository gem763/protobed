Mike Pence. He told viewers that he wondered \u201cwhether just acknowledging who I was was going to be the biggest career-ending professional setback.\u201d\n\nEventually the 37-year-old made a choice and decided to come out after returning from a deployment in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life, and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer. So, I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be,\u201d he said.\n\nHere is @PeteButtigieg\u2019s response to being asked about his biggest profesional setback. He talked about his struggle with coming out #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/c7wQNkJ1aQ \u2014 Max Lewis (@MaxLewisTV) September 13, 2019\n\nThe mayor went on to explain that it was an election year in his \u201csocially conservative\u201d community and that he wasn\u2019t sure what would happen after his coming out.\n\n\u201cWhen I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and they reelected me with 80% of the vote,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what\u2019s worth more to you than winning. I think that\u2019s what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about.\u201d\n\nThe moment marks the first in American history when we\u2019ve heard someone from the LGBTQ community openly talk on a presidential debate stage about what it was like to come out.\n\nButtigieg has talked publicly about being gay and his struggles with an \u201cinternal war.\u201d He\u2019s also talked about how he came out but never on a platform such as this.\n\nMany supporters of Buttigieg and viewers of the debate lauded the politician for his transparency, including his husband, Chasten.\n\nThose of us who are LGBT know that we come out every day. Every single day. A presidential candidate just did, again, in front of millions of Americans. That take courage and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to be his husband. \u2014 Chasten Buttigieg (@Chas10Buttigieg) September 13, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what others had to say about the significant moment:\n\n.@PeteButtigieg telling his coming out story on the national stage will help other people feel comfortable to do the same.\n\n\n\nIt has the potential to save lives. A powerful moment. #DemDebate \u2014 Elex Michaelson (@Elex_Michaelson) September 13, 2019\n\n.@PeteButtigieg sharing his coming out experience right now is ... everything #DemDebate \u2014 Lynda Tran (@Lynda_Tran) September 13, 2019\n\n\"I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out.\" @PeteButtigieg reflecting on the power of coming out and the power of trust was an incredible moment in the #DemDebate \u2014 Sarah Kate Ellis (@sarahkateellis) September 13, 2019\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg ... OMG ... just a pitch perfect answer to the Q about resilience.\n\n\n\nHe speaks candidly/honestly about coming out as a gay man, about trust, and about not knowing whether his career would be over by living his truth.\n\n\n\nSo much humanity there.#DemDebate \u2014 Lynnette KhalfaniCox (@themoneycoach) September 13, 2019\n\n.@PeteButtigieg tells his story about coming out on a national, presidential stage.\n\n\n\nRegardless of where his candidacy goes, this moment is powerful and important for every kid watching.\n\n\n\n\"I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love.\" \u2014 Elena Schneider (@ec_schneider) September 13, 2019\n\nOutside of Buttigieg\u2019s memorable admission, the debate lacked discussion on issues faced by the LGBTQ community. The omission was so notable that GLAAD, the world\u2019s largest LGBTQ media advocacy organization, released the following statement at the debate\u2019s conclusion:\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration has spent the last three years rolling back rights for LGBTQ and other marginalized communities, and it\u2019s imperative that LGBTQ people and the issues affecting our lives and our families not be overlooked in this Presidential election,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD.\n\n\u201cNext week\u2019s LGBTQ Forum in Iowa will correct the pattern we have seen in the first round of debates that have left LGBTQ people largely out of the conversation.\u201d", "description": "The Indiana mayor revealed that he came out after his deployment in Afghanistan: \"I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any ...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b086e3b00002a74d1f9a1.jpeg?cache=wskanem0ow&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
