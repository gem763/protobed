The Washington Times takes a weekly look at some of them that may have flown under the radar.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, on Thursday introduced a proposal intended to secure \u201cpower for women in the 21st century\u201d that includes measures to guarantee abortion rights rights and boost female representation in the White House Cabinet and the federal judiciary.\n\nThe plan includes measures intended to close the \u201cpay gap\u201d between men and women, including legislation requiring large companies to make public their median pay gap broken down by racial and ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cProgress for women has come despite systemic sexism and racism, and persistent gender bias,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd now, with women\u2019s rights under assault, we can\u2019t wait any longer to ensure women have the power they deserve.\u201d\n\nThe plan also includes a repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which generally bars federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, and federal legislation that would protect women\u2019s right to have an abortion even if the Supreme Court reverses the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nMr. Buttigieg also would nominate women to fill at least 50% of his Cabinet positions and federal judicial appointments.\n\nHe would invest more than $50 billion to provide access to capital and mentorship for female entrepreneurs.\n\nThe plan also includes a $10 billion investment over 10 years to try to combat sexual harassment and discrimination against women in the workplace.\n\nCastro on criminal justice\n\nFormer housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro on Wednesday announced a proposal to overhaul U.S. criminal justice policies with an eye toward trying to prevent young people from getting swept up into the court system.\n\nAmong other priorities, the Texas Democrat wants to expand the juvenile justice system to include people up to the age of 21 and keep all records of minors confidential.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about second chances in our criminal justice system, but too many young people don\u2019t truly ever get a first chance in life,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cSchools that are failing them, lack of opportunity and over-policed neighborhoods are setting our kids up for failure.\u201d\n\nTo break the \u201cschool to prison pipeline,\u201d Mr. Castro proposed ideas such as decriminalizing truancy by expanding the number of full-time case workers.\n\nHe also would end mandatory minimum sentences, end cash bail, limit the use of pretrial detention, and invest more money in public defenders.\n\nMr. Castro said he would work with states to require a criminal conviction before private property is seized through civil asset forfeiture, an issue that has attracted bipartisan interest from Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nHe also wants to implement \u201cSecond Chance Centers\u201d as one-stop shops where ex-convicts can get information on how to reintegrate into society.\n\nO\u2019Rourke on foreign help, pardons\n\nIn a proposal aimed directly at President Trump, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke on Tuesday introduced a plan that would step up punishment for improperly soliciting favors from foreign powers and would curb the power of presidents to issue pardons.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke would make soliciting a foreign power for \u201cpersonal profit or political gain\u201d a federal crime, both through civil and criminal liability.\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating whether Mr. Trump withheld financial aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to help investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a top political rival.\n\n\u201cCongress should act swiftly to impeach and to remove President Trump from office in light of his illegal actions,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cBut it is also time to pass additional reforms \u2026 so that Trump \u2014 and every president who follows \u2014 will never be above the law or able to welcome foreign interference in our democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke also wants to amend the Constitution to ban the use of a \u201cself-protective pardon,\u201d with which the president pardons an individual with ties to an investigation that targets the president or a family member.\n\nUntil that happens, Mr. O\u2019Rourke would require the president to disclose relevant evidence when he issues pardons to people \u201cwith ties to the president\u2019s own interests.\u201d\n\nHarris on tribal lands\n\nSen. Kamala Harris on Monday released a proposal intended to restore half a million acres to Native Americans.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s speak truth: we have failed in our obligations to tribal nations,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to chart a new course of fully empowering Native American communities and supporting their governments\u2019 right to self-determination and self-governance.\u201d\n\nShe set a goal of taking 500,000 acres into trust for federally recognized Indian tribes. She would push Congress to clarify that tribes federal recognized after 1934 can receive land into trust.\n\nMs. Harris also would shore up funds in the federal Indian Health Service by making the service exempt from across-the-board \u201csequester\u201d budget cuts and asking Congress to provide funds ahead of time so money would flow even during a government shutdown.\n\nShe also would increase funding for Bureau of Indian Education schools and dedicate $100 million for a new tribal emergency fund for substance abuse and mental health treatment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
