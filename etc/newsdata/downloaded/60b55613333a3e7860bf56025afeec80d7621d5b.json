Steve King has become a pariah within the Republican Party, and party leaders are eager to see a primary challenge. | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images campaigns \u2018We either clean house, or Democrats take those seats\u2019 Republicans are eager to see primary challenges to Rep. Steve King and other embattled lawmakers.\n\nParty officials normally hate primary challenges and all the messy drama that comes with a family feud. But this cycle, Republicans see an opportunity to clean out the dregs of the GOP.\n\nCandidates are lining up to challenge the House\u2019s most embattled Republicans \u2014 lawmakers who have been indicted, who have made racist comments, who have faced whisper campaigns in their home states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile GOP leaders typically stay out of primary contests, these members are getting snubbed or facing outright opposition from the party establishment. At least one member of GOP leadership \u2014 retiring Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan \u2014 has decided to back a primary opponent to hard-line conservative Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who was kicked off his committees for making racist remarks earlier this year.\n\nKing\u2019s comments \u201creflect negatively upon Republicans and, as a result, I will contribute to his primary opponent,\u201d Mitchell, the sophomore class representative, said in a statement.\n\nMitchell\u2019s stance underscores a broader feeling in the GOP conference, where many Republicans would be relieved to see fresh faces with less baggage emerge victorious in some of these primary races. Otherwise, the GOP will continue to take the reputational hit that comes with these lawmakers serving in office \u2014 or worse, the party could lose those seats in the general election.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of people who have been concerned for many, many months now about finding some way of getting rid of some of these guys,\u201d said Liz Mair, a GOP strategist. \u201cThere is a sense that we either clean House, or Democrats take those seats.\u201d\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Steve Watkins of Kansas, who has recently faced rumors that he\u2019s poised to resign amid scandal, became the latest Republican to draw a primary challenge this week. State Treasurer Jake LaTurner decided to jump into the race (and abandon his Senate bid) after receiving public encouragement from Republican former Gov. Jeff Colyer, a rare primary intervention that fueled buzz in GOP circles.\n\nA pile of Republican candidates is also vying to take on King, who has continued to kick up controversy all year, as well as indicted Rep. Chris Collins of New York, who was arrested on insider trading charges in August 2018.\n\nAnd last week, former Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) announced he was exploring whether to challenge his old colleague Rep. Duncan Hunter, who will go to trial early next year for allegedly misusing $250,000 in campaign funds to finance a lavish lifestyle.\n\nOutside groups are also itching to get involved, hoping to better position the party as Republicans try to claw their way back to power next year. The conservative Club for Growth is actively interviewing primary candidates for the Collins and Hunter races and keeping an eye on King\u2019s district as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told Republican leaders: We reserve the right to be in primaries, including in challenger races,\u201d David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, said in an interview. \u201cThere is a lot of tension. They don\u2019t want us to do that.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cWe also recognize that we need to make sure the Republican majority is sustained.\u201d\n\nKing, who has been condemned by both parties for racist and inflammatory remarks, set off alarm bells in the GOP last year when he nearly lost to a Democratic challenger, despite representing a Republican stronghold in the heart of Trump country. Now, King is in the political fight of his life, as four Republican candidates \u2014 led by state Sen. Randy Feenstra \u2014 have mounted a challenge against the embattled nine-term incumbent.\n\nWhile the top GOP leaders don\u2019t formally play in primaries, they certainly haven\u2019t done King any favors. Not only did they strip him of his committee assignments for defending white supremacy and white nationalism in an interview with the New York Times, but Rep. Liz Cheney \u2014 the No. 3 Republican in the House \u2014 has called on King to resign.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s time for him to go. The people of Iowa\u2019s 4th congressional district deserve better,\u201d the Wyoming Republican tweeted last month, after King\u2019s latest instance of eyebrow-raising rhetoric: suggesting humanity wouldn\u2019t exist if it weren\u2019t for rape and incest.\n\nKing also wasn\u2019t allowed to fly aboard Air Force One this summer when Trump flew to Iowa for a state GOP event \u2014 another sign of King\u2019s pariah status in the party.\n\nThe mix of snubs, demands for his resignation and lost committee assignments has left King struggling to raise money and complaining that the party is trying to tip the scales against him.\n\nAs a longstanding policy, the National Republican Congressional Committee does not spend in primaries. But the House GOP campaign\u2019s arm did condemn King last cycle for a separate set of inflammatory comments and pulled support for him shortly before Election Day.\n\n\u201cIf I were sitting there as NRCC chair, I would want to dump these guys, all three of them, in the trash,\u201d Mair said, referring to King, Collins and Hunter.\n\nHunter and Collins created headaches for the GOP last summer when they were both indicted, tarnishing the party\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d message and sparking fears that their once-safe seats would turn competitive. Both lawmakers, however, refused to step down and narrowly defeated their Democratic challengers.\n\nHunter has been accused by federal prosecutors of misusing campaign cash, including to pursue extramarital affairs with congressional aides and lobbyists. With Hunter at risk of facing serious jail time, Republican San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio has already announced a primary bid. Meanwhile, Issa \u2014 who still has friends in the House GOP after serving there nearly 20 years \u2014 is also considering jumping into the race.\n\nRank-and-file members, like leadership, tend to stay out of ugly primary fights involving their colleagues. But Issa\u2019s entrance into the race could complicate the equation for some of the GOP\u2019s California delegation, who already saw their ranks dwindle after the last election.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising to see a few \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say a ton \u2014 but a few members of the California delegation come out for Issa,\u201d said Republican strategist Doug Heye.\n\nCollins, meanwhile, will go on trial in February for insider trading charges. His spokeswoman said he will \u201cdecide on re-election over the next few months,\u201d but argued the New York Republican \u201cremains effective in representing his constituents\u201d and maintains \u201ca close relationship with the White House.\u201d\n\nLocal GOP candidates see an opening and are rushing to challenge Collins, warning Republican voters that the seat could flip if Collins stays on the ticket.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nLike King, both Collins and Hunter have been booted from their committee assignments, handing even more ammo to their opponents who have questioned their value in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe only way this district is lost is if Chris Collins is on the ballot,\u201d state Sen. Chris Jacobs (R-Buffalo), who declared his bid against Collins in May, told POLITICO.\n\nA bitter battle is also brewing in Kansas, where Watkins is facing a primary challenge from LaTurner after being dogged by resignation rumors appearing in local media. Watkins has dismissed any suggestion that he would leave office, and his chief of staff has slammed the chatter as a \"whisper campaign coming from political operatives in Kansas.\u201d\n\nBut concern is growing in Kansas GOP circles about Watkins\u2019 viability as a candidate next year, according to multiple sources. Before narrowly winning his election in 2018, Watkins came under fire for reports of sexual misconduct and for inaccurately claiming he started and expanded a private contracting company in the Middle East.\n\nLaTurner said he has not had conversations with House GOP leaders or anyone at the NRCC, but said he expected to at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we don\u2019t want to see another congressional seat be turned over to the Democrats in Kansas,\u201d LaTurner told POLITICO, accusing Watkins of poor coalition building and lackluster fundraising. \u201cCongressman Watkins, without question, puts this seat in jeopardy this cycle.\u201d\n\nWatkins\u2019 camp is already firing back, in a preview of the intraparty feud to come.\n\n\u201cJake LaTurner\u2019s entire career has been political ladder-climbing \u2014 and that climb ends in August,\u201d said Bryan Piligra, a spokesman for Watkins.\n\nSome strategists argue that tough primary fights aren\u2019t entirely bad for the party. The winner can emerge battle-tested and better prepared to absorb attacks from Democratic opponents.\n\nBut if Republicans rip each other apart in a nasty primary, it could also bruise the nominee while straining relationships inside the party.\n\n\u201cPrimaries pit families against each other. ... You will have accusations of backstabbing and being a traitor,\u201d said Heye. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why they can become especially negative and do so very quickly.\u201d\n\nJames Arkin and Anna Gronewold contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Republicans are eager to see primary challenges to Rep.
