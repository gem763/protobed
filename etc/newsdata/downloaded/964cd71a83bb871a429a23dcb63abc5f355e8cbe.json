Shielded under umbrellas, many wearing masks, several hundred demonstrators clogged a thoroughfare in the central business district, carrying a yellow banner marked \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d and shouting, \u201cHong Kong, resist!\u201d\n\nScattered gatherings of protesters in masks popped up elsewhere, too, with some holding hands in a human chain. But protester numbers Saturday afternoon appeared down from previous weekends when tens of thousands flooded the streets.\n\nA combination of factors seemed to be at work. Some marchers said the protest movement that has plunged Hong Kong into its deepest crisis since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 was merely harboring strength for the long haul.\n\nThe closure of the entire MTR network of subway and trains that habitually handles more than 4 million trips a day also caused major disruption to the usually never-resting but now edgy and restive city of 7.5 million people. An express link to Hong Kong international airport also closed for a while before reopening with reduced service Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cFrom MTR to EmptyR,\u201d tweeted activist Joshua Wong, a key player in 2014 protests that foreshadowed the past four months of demonstrations that have snowballed into a sustained flare of anti-government and anti-China fury.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d said Kevin Cui, a tourist from mainland China who\u2019d planned to visit Hong Kong Disneyland only to discover at a shuttered subway station that the network was suspended. \u201cThis is very troublesome.\u201d\n\nFollowing up on its face-mask ban that went into effect at midnight Friday, the government also hammered home a get-tough message that it would not bow to rioters and appealed for public support after an overnight rash of widespread violence, including arson attacks. Citizens awoke Saturday not only to closed subway stations but also shuttered shops and banks, where lines formed at cash machines.\n\nIn a televised address broadcast as protesters again marched in masks, a solemn Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, described Hong Kong as \u201csemi-paralyzed\u201d and said, \u201cEveryone is worried, anxious, or even scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government needs to take drastic measures to say no to violence, restore peace in society, protect citizens\u2019 right to continue their daily lives and freedom, not allowing a small group of rioters to destroy it,\u201d she said.\n\nJohn Lee, the government\u2019s security secretary, said by not condemning violence, people are stoking it.\n\n\u201cWhat is adding oil to violence is people\u2019s support for these acts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important is that everybody comes out to say, \u2018No, society will not accept violence.'\u201d\n\nSome agreed, even as they continued to blame Lam for sparking the protest movement with a now abandoned measure that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts in mainland China.\n\n\u201cThere is outright rioting,\u201d said retiree Peter Tai, 67, stocking up on groceries for fear they\u2019d become hard to find.\n\n\u201cProtesters want democracy and freedom, but don\u2019t they have freedom now? People can go anywhere and do things freely. Freedom is more valuable than democracy. I hope these young people don\u2019t do things they\u2019ll regret forever,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many peaceful protesters say violence has become a means to an end, the only way for young masked protesters to force the government to bend to clamors for full democracy and other demands.\n\nAs a group of black-clad youths in protective gear rushed past him, many carrying bamboo sticks, a property industry worker who came out with his wife Friday night to show his opposition to the mask ban expressed his admiration for those confronting police.\n\n\u201cI know they have done terrible things\u201d he said. \u201cCan you believe how brave they are?\u201d\n\nHe gave only his first name, Alex. He and his wife, Pauline, both donned masks that covered their mouths to hit streets in central Hong Kong, where clouds of police tear gas to disperse protesters also caused spluttering tourists and Friday night revelers to flee, eyes stinging.\n\nUnder cover of darkness, masked protesters rampaged, setting fires, setting up makeshift road blocks that backed up traffic and vandalizing subway stations, China-linked businesses and other property.\n\nAn officer fired a single shot from his gun in self-defense after he was attacked by protesters in the northern Yuen Long district, said police spokeswoman Yolanda Yu. She said a man was wounded, but police didn\u2019t know exactly how he got shot. A police official, who requested anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, said the victim is 14. A Hospital Authority spokesman said the teen was in serious but not critical condition.\n\nThe teen became the second victim of gunfire in the protests that began in June. An 18-year-old protester was also shot at close range by a riot police officer on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press videojournalist Katie Tam contributed to this report.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 With subway services shut down, the wearing of face masks criminalized at rallies and Hong Kong's leader reaffirming her determination", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/05/ac4746_aptopix-hong-kong-protests-91019-masked-protester-holds-up-his-hand-represent-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
