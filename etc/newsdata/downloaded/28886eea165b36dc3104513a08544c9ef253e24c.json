If Abraham was looking to get the left up in arms, he certainly succeeded. Take a look at the ad embedded in the tweet below and see if you can guess which of the truths he\u2019s promising to speak has liberals setting their hair on fire. (Well, to the greatest extent, anyway.)\n\nOur new #lagov TV ad starts today. As your next governor, I will always tell you the truth.#Doc4Gov pic.twitter.com/jZOFVxpMJB \u2014 Dr. Ralph Abraham (@DocAbraham) August 22, 2019\n\nIf you guessed it was the last one, saying that there are only two genders, give yourself a cookie. Of course, as a medical doctor, Abraham probably knows a thing or two about the subject. Here\u2019s the full list:\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth. Life begins at conception. Government is too big. Our taxes are too high. And our car insurance is too expensive. President Trump is doing a great job. Facts matter more than feelings. The Second Amendment is self-explanatory. And as a doctor, I can assure you there are only two genders.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect, this prompted an immediate reaction. The claim wasn\u2019t going over well at all at MSNBC. (Redstate)\n\nMSNBC anchor Chris Jansing addressed this topic during a panel discussion about the GOP\u2019s relationship with women and the LGBT community. (Specifically, a national LGBT group, the Log Cabin Republicans, had just endorsed Trump for a second term.) An indignant Jansing told viewers she found Abraham\u2019s remarks to be \u201cincendiary.\u201d Here\u2019s what she had to say. (video below) We\u2019ve got an important question now. What does it mean to be a mainstream Republican? It is the question that some Republicans have been asking in the age of Donald Trump, and increasingly, it seems the answer might be to make incendiary comments about women and members of the LGBT community. In Louisiana, the Republican candidate for governor, Ralph Abraham, is out with a new TV ad this week making incendiary comments about gender.\n\nYou can catch the video of anchor Chris Jansing saying this at the linked Redstate article.\n\nSo it\u2019s apparently now simply gospel at MSNBC to say that a medical doctor stating the human race is composed of two genders by design is \u201cincendiary\u201d rhetoric. Of course, for the entire history of the human race, there have been two genders (with the thankfully rare exceptions of intersex people born with anomalous chromosomal structures). It\u2019s how we reproduce. This really isn\u2019t rocket science.\n\nBut this is apparently the state of play in American politics today. We\u2019ve traditionally tolerated people with all sorts of rather questionable ideas, but as long as we were all able to agree to disagree we generally just got on with our lives. Now, holding a different opinion than someone in one of the entitled classes isn\u2019t just a case of disagreement. It\u2019s verbal violence that makes people feel unsafe. So you\u2019re a bad person for doing it.\n\nWe\u2019re not debating an issue along the lines of whether yellow mustard is better than brown here. (It\u2019s not, by the way, but I\u2019m not going to try to lock you up for thinking so.) This is just science. You can\u2019t wake up one day and decide that reality has shifted simply because of how you feel about it. That applies even if you really, really, earnestly believe it. You might honestly believe that you\u2019re a werewolf. (The condition is known as clinical lycanthropy.) But unless you can show us that you can somehow transform into a canid creature of some sort, I\u2019m sorry to say that you\u2019re still just a human being. A very confused human being who may be dealing with some mental health issues, but a human being nonetheless.\n\nBest of luck to Congressman Abraham as he makes his pitch for election. But his odds of winning over anyone on the left in the current political climate by stating obvious facts taken from medical science are pretty much nil. He\u2019s one of the \u201cincendiary\u201d people now.", "description": "Pull the brake lever on the crazy train, please", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CrossGenderRestroomSign715.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
