He rang and said she can't come to set!'\n\nVicky also revealed that she has fun with the Line Of Duty cast and they often played jokes on each other while filming.\n\nShe said: 'On screen, we mess about. We have those notebooks which we open in the scene and we like to draw in them - I\u2019ll let you imagine what. So, we can show each other in scenes.'\n\nVicky also said she doesn't spend more than three weeks away from her producer and actor fianc\u00e9 Jonny Owen while filming.\n\nThe Line of Duty star films the BBC drama away from home in Belfast, and has said she finds filming 'tough' because it's hard to be away from Jonny.\n\nVicky said: 'I have to balance it. I don't do more than three weeks because I start losing my head.'\n\nStar: Otto Farrant plays teenage spy, Alex Rider in the new series\n\nHowever Vicky said she is lucky that Jonny, who starred in UK version of Shameless and appeared with her in This Is England '90, understands her hectic schedule.\n\nShe added: 'Jonny is in the industry so he understands. You have to be dead not to go into work.'\n\nBack in April Vicky spoke candidly about her love life while on Elizabeth Day's How To Fail podcast, as she admitted she 'just knew' her fianc\u00e9 was the one when they first met.\n\nThe star revealed: 'When we first spoke it was on the phone. I came off the phone and I just knew. I absolutely know.'\n\nVicky went on: 'We literally lived together from a week of meeting. We have basically stayed together from that time until now. We've never lived apart. Seven years in March. I am not sure about fate but I couldn't see my life without him.\n\n'I've never loved anyone more than I've loved Jonny. It sounds cheesy but I love him more and more every day. Things get better and better. Seven years with someone - I feel really lucky. I've had relationships where I didn't have that.'\n\nThe couple worked together on This Is England '90, and Vicky said that the series is still relevant today.\n\nShe said: 'People still contact me on social media and come up to me in the street, it\u2019s a timeless piece.\n\n'It\u2019s called This is England, not this was. Abuse, race and all the issues in it are still here they haven\u2019t changed. And now Lol\u2019s style is bang on trend.'\n\nDespite the long hours and work away from home, Vicky said she is determined to keep working in the 'fickle industry'.\n\nShe said: 'I don't know when this will end, my career. I wait until the contract lands in my hand then it's real.\n\n'I've had so much rejection and been so close. They say they love you, they really want you and I think, that means they don't. It can be a fickle business.'", "description": "Vicky McClure looked effortlessly chic as she attended the Alex Rider panel at London Comic Con 2019 on Saturday.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland", "Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20225960-0-image-a-19_1572124336430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
