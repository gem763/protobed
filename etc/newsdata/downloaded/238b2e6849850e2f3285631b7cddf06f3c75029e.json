Other partners to the project include edge resource marketplace MobiledgeX and global IT firm Unisys.\n\nThe project, based on code from Dell Technologies, aims to build on the concept of a Data Confidence Fabric, which establishes measurable trust and confidence in data coming from multiple sources. The system would score data based on its trustworthiness and reliability.\n\nDell CTO Jason Shepherd said that scored data trustworthiness could help organizations meet different compliance requirements like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nOther firms are also developing data trustworthiness ratings\n\nAs more sensitive data gets put on blockchains, different organizations and industry players are developing methods to verify the provenance and reliability of recorded data.\n\nIn July, Japanese tech research firm Fujitsu Laboratories announced that it had developed a blockchain-based system for evaluating user credentials, identity and trustworthiness in online transactions.\n\nThe platform would consider user ratings and subsequently assign them a trustworthiness score. Users would rate each other when a transaction occurs, after which the technology evaluates the data to evaluate users\u2019 relationships with one another.\n\nIota and its partnerships\n\nAt the end of September Iota formed a partnership with the Linux Foundation through LF Edge, an umbrella organization that aims to establish an open, interoperable framework for edge computing independent of hardware, silicon, cloud, or operating system.\n\nEarlier this month, Iota partnered with open-source platform Fiware, to use its Tangle technology for smart solutions. Specifically, Fiware intends to deploy Tangle for the decentralized storage of data on devices.", "description": "Iota, Dell and Linux Developing Platform to Rate Data Trustworthiness | News by Cointelegraph", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5ldS1jZW50cmFsLTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTktMTAvYjZiNTgxMmYtOWQ1Zi00OThhLThlMGYtNjY3YjA3ZjA1N2JjLmpwZw==.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
