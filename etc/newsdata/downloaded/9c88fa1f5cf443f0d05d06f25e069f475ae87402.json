Ghani is urging the nation to determine its fate without foreign interference. (Nishanuddin Khan/AP)\n\nWith U.S.-Taliban peace talks at a critical moment and insurgent violence on the rise, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is set to travel on short notice to Washington in the next week to meet with U.S. officials, an aide to a senior official in Ghani\u2019s administration confirmed Friday. The trip was planned for Saturday but has now been delayed by several days, the aide said.\n\nMeanwhile, the top U.S. peace negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, returned to Qatar on Thursday to meet with Taliban officials after the latest round of talks there had already ended, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nBoth unexpected moves came as Afghan society reeled from a surge of Taliban attacks that erupted over the past week in Kabul and elsewhere, even as Khalilzad and other U.S. officials declared that a peace deal was imminent. The attacks left scores of people dead and residents anxious, confused and angry.\n\n[After Taliban bomb kills civilians, Afghans call for foreign compound to be closed]\n\nThere is particular concern that insurgents will target Shiite communities in Kabul, which are observing Muharram, a solemn period for Shiites. Militants from the Taliban and Islamic State have attacked mosques, shrines and other Shiite gathering places during Muharram in previous years.\n\n\u201cEveryone is scared now. Nobody wants to go to work or send their kids to school because there might be more explosions,\u201d said Kamal Khan, 32, a mason who was sharing tea with his brothers on a blanket outside a hospital Friday morning. They were waiting to visit an elderly cousin who was blinded in a suicide bombing in Jalalabad this week.\n\n\n\nFatana Elyasi, 18, grieves by her fiance\u2019s grave in Kabul on Aug. 31, 2019.

(Siobhan O'Grady/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe have all been hoping for peace, but the Taliban want to show they are strong by killing,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe would like to have elections, but people will be too afraid to vote. Everything is stuck now. We have lost our way.\u201d\n\nAfter years of conflict, Afghans have become used to the dreadful routine of urban violence \u2014 the gruesome wounds inflicted by explosives, the hastily dug graves. But the growing anticipation of peace, and plans for a presidential election later this month, had allowed people to imagine a life without war for the first time in decades.\n\nNow, conflicting signals from Taliban and U.S. officials, a fierce battle among the Afghan political elite about who will negotiate later with the insurgents, and doubts about whether an election should be held at all have left many Afghans perplexed and anguished.\n\n\u201cThis is a very unsettling moment for Afghans. They are suffering through stepped-up insurgent violence while Washington tries to finalize a deal that many regard as a surrender,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, a regional expert at the Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. \u201cThe Afghan political leadership seems indecisive and divided, at a critical moment with elections just a few weeks away. This is a high-grade mess.\u201d\n\nOne telling sign of Afghan frustrations came Monday, after insurgents bombed a secure compound for foreign contractors and visitors on the outskirts of Kabul. A spokesman for the Taliban said it was targeting \u201cforeign occupiers,\u201d but most of the 16 people killed were Afghan civilians. A Romanian diplomat was among the dead. Enraged local residents surrounded the site, shouting that the foreigners should leave because they are a magnet for attacks.\n\nOn Thursday, a car bomb explosion near the U.S. Embassy and the Afghan intelligence headquarters here killed 10 Afghan civilians and two NATO service members, one of them an American. The Taliban also launched offensives in the far western province of Farah and the northeastern province of Baghlan, a reminder of the reach of its fighting capacity.\n\nAfghan officials have expressed serious concerns about the proposed deal, saying it does not offer enough assurance that Afghan civilians and security forces will be protected if U.S. troops withdraw as agreed. The new spate of violence has deepened that concern, and appeared to have prompted Ghani\u2019s plans to visit Washington.\n\n\u201cSeeking peace with this group that is still pursuing the killing of innocent people is meaningless,\u201d Ghani said Thursday.\n\nAdding to the chaos, the head of the Afghan intelligence agency was forced to step down Thursday after the day\u2019s Kabul bombing and an Afghan security raid in Jalalabad that killed four brothers and aroused local protests.\n\n[As U.S.-Taliban deal nears, Afghanistan\u2019s Ghani hardens resolve to hold elections on time]\n\nCritics have accused Ghani of abetting political turmoil by insisting on holding the election under dangerous conditions in an effort to win a second term. Others accused his government of failing to plan for Afghan talks with Taliban leaders that are supposed to come after a U.S. deal.\n\nConflicting U.S. statements have also heightened public confusion and worry about the proposed deal, which has been negotiated in secret. Khalilzad has painted it as a positive step, and President Trump has stressed the urgency of removing U.S. forces from the country. But a key Republican senator and a group of former U.S. diplomats have warned against a hasty withdrawal. The diplomats said Afghanistan could collapse into civil war unless some troops remain and a stronger deal is signed.\n\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted Saturday evening that the group had held meetings with Khalilzad, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani and U.S. Army Gen. Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cBoth meetings were positive and well attended,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the absence of U.S. government openness about the deal, alarmist rumors have spread across Afghan society. People are worried that thousands of Taliban prisoners may be released, that the deal will not spell out the rights of women, and especially that the Taliban will wait until thousands of U.S. troops are withdrawn and then renege on its promises with impunity.\n\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s happening is a mystery,\u201d said Abdul Azam, a telephone company worker. \u201cDo we know if the Taliban doing the negotiations are the real Taliban group in power? We hear the president making speeches and saying everything will be fine, but it\u2019s not. People are confused and afraid.\u201d\n\nIn west Kabul, where many Shiite Muslims and minority ethnic Hazaras live, the fear is palpable and specific.\n\nOmid Hajji Agha, 19, said mosques in the area were \u201cfull during Muharram in the past, but not anymore. There is no security here. Everyone talks about peace, but peace talks are cheap words. Still the fighting continues.\u201d\n\nSharif Hassan and John Hudson contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The Afghan president and the chief U.S. negotiator engage in shuttle diplomacy as the Taliban steps up attacks in Kabul and elsewhere.", "authors": ["Pamela Constable", "Foreign Correspondent Covering Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "South Asia", "Latin America", "Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Worldviews Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BfPVuBn3bEvA_VoHoVV7y2HSWY8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DEPCL2WQWYI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
