In one of the more blatant impeachment stories of the week, New York Times columnist James B. Stewart went on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show to tell everyone that Trump is right. Stewart was pushing a new book, \u201cDeep State,\u201d only he sees the Deep Staters as heroes \u2013 the same way the rest of his media buddies do.\n\nCo-host Savannah Guthrie tossed him a softball question, clearly amazed that Trump would call out the government employees who are trying to sabotage his administration.\n\n\u201cAnd his central allegation is that there are people inside these government agencies actively working against him,\u201d Guthrie said to Stewart. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d (Watch the video. Guthrie\u2019s hand movements and inflection are a great example of how journalists manipulate a news story in ways that are hard to tell from transcripts.)\n\nGuthrie got the answer Trump supporters already knew: Trump was right, but Stewart gave his own personal spin so viewers knew the good guys.\n\n\u201cWell, you meet these characters in my book, and the fact is, in a sense, he\u2019s right,\u201d Stewart said, referring to the president. \u201cThere is a Deep State, there is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the Constitution, respect the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty clear, despite Stewart\u2019s attempt at making the Deep Staters seem honorable. \u201cWhat Trump calls the Deep State in the United States is protecting the American people and protecting the Constitution. It\u2019s a positive thing in this sense,\u201d he added.\n\nOnly leftists see a government employee working to overturn the result of a legal election as \u201cpositive.\u201d\n\nFor those of you following at home, that\u2019s another media narrative destroyed. Bury it next to the Russia collusion hoax.\n\nOf course there\u2019s a Deep State. Americans know this, which is why they should doubt the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who didn\u2019t even have firsthand information.\n\nThe biggest proponents of impeachment outside the Deep State are what we should probably call the Shallow Media. Take NBC\u2019s histrionic Political Director Chuck Todd. Recently he was screaming that \u201cA National Nightmare Is Upon Us!\u201d (One other than watching NBC.) Now he\u2019s upset about Americans having \u201ctwo sets of realities.\u201d\n\nWhat he was really saying is a bunch of Americans dare to think for themselves and realize that Todd has lost any sense of neutrality.\n\nOnly leftists see a government employee working to overturn the result of a legal election as \u201cpositive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a 40 percent of the country that is only getting fed one reality; arguably, 60 percent are getting what I would argue is reality,\u201d Todd said.\n\nHubris is a symptom of bad journalism.\n\nThe same attitude was evident in a graphic used on-screen during \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d It said: \u201cWH Declares War on Impeachment Inquiry & Constitution.\u201d Media bias? At CNN? Never! It\u2019s one thing to declare war on a bogus impeachment. It\u2019s another thing to declare war on the Constitution.\n\nBut media outlets were more than willing to go all Schiff-ty and simply make things up.\n\nIn a memorable exchange, Trump tweeted how former President Barack Obama had said \u201che did not have the right to sign DACA\u201d and did it anyway. Within minutes, the crafty folks at PolitiFact rated that \u201cMostly False.\u201d But five minutes later, Washington Post White House reporter Seung Min Kim pointed out that PolitiFact was, in fact, wrong.\n\nThen there\u2019s one of my favorites: bias by omission. It\u2019s not just the stupid and one-sided comments journalists make, it\u2019s what they leave out.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s the media fascination with former Secretary of State Colin Powell whining about \u201chis party.\u201d The problem is, NBC, MSNBC and CNN claimed \u201chis party\u201d was the Republicans, even though he\u2019s endorsed Democrats for president three times in a row. He hasn\u2019t backed a Republican for president since the 2004 election.\n\nPretty soon, they\u2019ll be calling far-left Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a Republican because she was one until 20 years ago. (Yes, she really was.)\n\nNew allegations against Matt Lauer\n\nThe Matt Lauer disaster continues to shock even the most cynical media watchers. Investigative reporter Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d includes allegations that the former NBC \u201cToday\u201d host raped another NBC employee in a hotel room during the 2014 Olympics.\n\nFarrow also slammed the network for blocking his investigation into movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He eventually took his story to The New Yorker. Farrow alleged that Weinstein had tried to blackmail the network to make the story go away, claiming Weinstein \u201cwas aware of Lauer\u2019s behavior and capable of revealing it.\u201d\n\nNBC cited the book in a story, saying it had reportedly \u201creached nondisclosure agreements with at least seven women who alleged harassment or discrimination at the company, including former employees with complaints about former \u2018Today\u2019 host Matt Lauer.\u201d\n\nLauer denied the alleged rape but said he engaged in an \u201cextramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter.\u201d\n\nFacebook defends free speech\n\nSocial media companies are caught between a rock and a hard place. They hit the scene as free-speech venues and have gradually restricted speech more and more. Now Facebook has taken a positive step in support of free speech and many in the media don\u2019t like it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Trump campaign created an ad about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Ukraine. The reaction was swift. CNN refused to run the ad and NBCUniversal (the folks dealing with the Lauer rape allegations) wouldn\u2019t run it either.\n\nTeam Biden demanded Facebook take it down as well. But the company refused, arguing it doesn\u2019t fact-check political speech.\n\nThe left and media were infuriated. The Washington Post headline showed the media mindset: \u201cCNN won\u2019t run two Trump campaign ads, citing \u2018demonstrably false\u2019 claims.\u201d Facebook was supposed to follow CNN\u2019s lead and didn\u2019t.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSen. Warren took out an ad showing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shaking hands with Trump and pretending \u201cFacebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.\u201d She admitted it wasn\u2019t true, but remained furious that Facebook wouldn\u2019t play the role of referee so her campaign could try to ban Trump ads.\n\nIt might not seem like a big deal, but Facebook is facing constant calls to regulate speech. It\u2019s nice to see the social media giant go all Nancy Reagan and \u201cjust say no!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "New York Times columnist James B.
