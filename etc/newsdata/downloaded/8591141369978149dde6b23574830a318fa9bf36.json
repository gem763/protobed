These first few months are tough with exhaustion and nausea...and I don\u2019t want to have to pretend that I feel ok.\"\n\nHilaria Baldwin, 35, and Alec Baldwin, 61, are already parents to Carmen, 6, Rafael, 5, Leonardo, 3, and Romeo, 1. Baldwin also has a 23-year-old daughter, Ireland, from his marriage to actress Kim Basinger.\n\nIn April, Hilaria Baldwin announced on social media that she'd experienced a miscarriage and had undergone a dilation and curettage procedure. A D&C, according to the Mayo Clinic, is the procedure in which tissue is removed from the uterus.\n\n\"Since so many of you have been asking, I want to tell you that I am doing well. It has been 2 weeks since the d&c and I am physically starting to feel like myself again,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Emotionally I am ok too...when we choose to become parents, we take a big risk with our hearts. Never do we love so intensely\u2014and this is scary, but so worth it.\"", "description": "Hilaria and Alec Baldwin are expecting their fifth child five months after experiencing a miscarriage, she announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/alec-hilaria-gty-jt-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
