Powell is set to take the podium at the press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET following the Federal Open Market Committee announcement.\n\n\"The last few times we heard him speak we got the distinct sense that the message he intends to convey is not always received as such by the markets,\" Harvey said.\n\nIndeed, over the past year Powell has had a few miscommunications that roiled the financial markets. In December, he described the Fed's reduction of its balance sheet asset holdings as being on \"autopilot,\" a signal of tighter policy ahead.\n\nIn July, Powell characterized an interest rate cut as a \"midcycle adjustment\" rather than the beginning of a period of successive cuts that the market was looking for.\n\n\"When it comes to commentary, we believe that less is more,\" Harvey said. \"Obviously, requiring a press conference for every Fed meeting suggests the Chairman holds a much different view. We shall see.\"\n\n\u2014 With reporting by Michael Bloom", "description": "On the eve of the Fed's announcement, some on Wall Street started to get flashbacks to Chair Jerome Powell's communication miscues.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106165446-1570213965484gettyimages-1173649930.jpeg?v=1570213986", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
