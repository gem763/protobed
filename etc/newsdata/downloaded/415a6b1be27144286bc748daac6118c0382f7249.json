However, a closer look would reveal it all.\n\nThousands of people in Lebanon thronged public spaces in capital Beirut and across Lebanon on October 20 in the largest protests in the country since 2005. The protests proved to be a great unifier for an often divided public in revolt against traditional leaders who have ruled for three decades and brought the economy to the brink of disaster.\n\nThe uprising began four days ago after the government announced new tax proposals.\n\nHowever, the protests were not anything like a regular protest scene.\n\nRallies turned into parties with music blaring and protesters dancing, singing and chanting, \u201cThe people want to bring down the regime.\u201d\n\nPeople were seen carrying placards that read, \u201cHappiest depressed people you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 1.6 K SHARES 265 SHARES 142 SHARES 17.6 K SHARES\n\n#Lebanon \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde7: this is #Beirut today.

Despite the wars, corruption and chaos, the Lebanese are a very resilient lot who can find joy in just about anything. More power to them! \u2014 Zdoubleyoo (@zdoubleyoo) October 20, 2019\n\n\"'Happiest depressed people you'll ever meet': Lebanon protests erupt for fourth day\" https://t.co/dCom5MTG5n \u2014 Dawndawn (@Dawndaw41131715) October 21, 2019\n\nI love that Lebanese from all over the world are protesting in solidarity. The Lebanese diaspora is strength! To be Lebanese is an out of country experience. There are more Lebanese out side of Lebanon \u2014 Z-MUNNIE\u2122 (@zbaalbaki) October 21, 2019\n\nIn mornings, men and women carried blue bags and cleaned the streets of the capital, Beirut, picking up trash left behind by the previous night\u2019s protests.\n\nIn Beirut, small bathing pools were set up on the main ring-road and in Martyr's Square, men reclining in them shirtless.\n\nShisha pipes have been pervasive, with sidewalks transformed into impromptu cafes.\n\nLebanon suffers from high unemployment, little growth and one of the highest debts ratios in the world, standing at 150 per cent of the gross domestic product. Public services have remained off for years now and power stations remain dilapidated.\n\nThe proposed new taxes that sparked the protests were part of stringent austerity measures aimed at tackling crisis, measures that critics say fall mainly on the struggling public.", "description": "Thousands of people in Lebanon thronged public spaces in capital Beirut and across Lebanon on October 20 in the largest protests in the country since 2005.
