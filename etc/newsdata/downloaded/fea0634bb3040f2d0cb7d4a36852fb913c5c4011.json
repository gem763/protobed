Nixon was gone four days later.", "language": "en", "text": "That staunch, consistent partisanship is a tricky combination. Democrats haven\u2019t budged in wanting to see Trump booted from office, and Republicans haven\u2019t budged in wanting him to stay. It makes comparisons with past impeachment threats \u2014 like that faced by President Richard Nixon \u2014 tricky.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNixon\u2019s approval rating was inversely correlated to support for removing him from office. As the latter went up, the former went down. The result is that comparing where Trump is to where Nixon was creates a weird division.\n\nNew data from Gallup released on Wednesday shows Trump\u2019s approval rating \u2014 39 percent \u2014 is about where Nixon\u2019s was in the middle of 1973. The level of support for impeaching him and removing him from office, though \u2014 52 percent \u2014 is essentially where Nixon\u2019s would have been right before he resigned in August of the following year.\n\nThere has been movement. In June, Gallup had Trump\u2019s job approval higher and support for impeaching him lower.\n\nThe problem here is we only have two data points. Yes, there\u2019s been an increase in support for impeachment, but there have also been a number of developments that have put new pressure on the president. In June, Trump hadn\u2019t yet spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, for example. Nor had Democrats formally begun an impeachment inquiry. So is this a quick jump up? Or is it the start of a long-term trend? We\u2019ll have to see.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat it does highlight is how uncharted the current territory is. Gallup\u2019s report on support for impeaching Trump notes only 32 percent of the country wanted to see President Bill Clinton removed from office in late 1998. Meaning the only time Americans have ever told Gallup they more strongly support impeaching and removing a president from office \u2014 on Aug. 5, 1974 \u2014 that president was gone four days later.\n\nWhich is, again, why it\u2019s so odd for Trump to be openly fighting with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nWe walked through this last week when Trump first decided to allow Turkey to move into Syria, opening the door for an attack on Kurdish forces that had fought with the United States against the Islamic State. Trump is not immediately at risk of being booted from office since he would need to be impeached and then opposed by 20 Republican senators. But it\u2019s certainly not the sort of thing it makes a lot of sense to test.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, presented with a question about being criticized on the issue by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Trump was cruelly dismissive. Graham, he said, would \u201clike to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers and fighting other people\u2019s wars.\u201d Graham should instead focus on his work with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Trump said, targeting Democrats and former FBI officials.\n\nGraham responded with obvious irritation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 who on Wednesday briefed his caucus on the mechanics of a likely impeachment trial \u2014 rebuked Trump strongly (for McConnell).\n\nAfter @realDonaldTrump says Kurds are \u201cno angels,\u201d @senatemajldr McConnell opens weekly presser w/this:\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to express my gratitude to the Kurds. We had a great alliance...I\u2019m sorry that we are where we are. I hope the VP and the Sec of State can somehow repair the damage.\u201d \u2014 Lindsay Wise (@lindsaywise) October 16, 2019\n\nCNN reported last week that Trump\u2019s strategy for keeping his party in line was to strong-arm them. He\u2019s been calling McConnell regularly and threatening to attack senators who publicly break with him. If that\u2019s also his strategy in the House, it isn\u2019t working. The House overwhelmingly voted to condemn Trump\u2019s actions on Syria and Turkey on Wednesday \u2014 a vote that included members of the House Republican leadership and numerous other Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo this is where we are: Public support for removing Trump from office is up in Gallup\u2019s polling to nearly the level seen right before Nixon resigned. The one backstop Trump has against that happening is the support of Senate Republicans \u2014 a group that is frustrated by his actions on Turkey and that Trump plans to keep loyal through threats.\n\nIt\u2019s still unlikely that support for impeachment grows substantially from here (thanks to support from Republican voters), and it\u2019s still unlikely that 20 Republican senators turn on Trump (thanks to their fear of Republican voters).\n\nBut Trump fumbling an important alliance while being convinced he\u2019s making all the right decisions is certainly not without recent precedent.\n\nAD", "description": "Which, again, is why his fight with Senate Republicans is bizarre.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eWHF8yeY-woPp99K8_9JiufIyqI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5SXYGVXMOUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
