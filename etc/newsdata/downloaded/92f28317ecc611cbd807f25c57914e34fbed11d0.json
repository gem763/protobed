The shares opened Oct. 25 at $1,697.55 after closing Oct. 24 at $1,780.78. Before trading opened, I grabbed some for my retirement account. My price was $1,687.\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt the price I paid, Amazon\u2019s market capitalization would be about $835 billion.\n\nThrough the first three quarters of 2019 Amazon has delivered earnings of $16.88. The fourth quarter is always Amazon\u2019s best, and last year the company earned $6.18 per share for the fourth quarter. Thus, the price I paid represents a price-to-earnings ratio of about 73.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAm I crazy or what?\n\nAbout That Bad Quarter\n\nA lot depends on what you think of that \u201cbad\u201d quarter. Earnings came in about 50 cents per share below estimates. But revenue from the Amazon Web Services cloud came in at $9 billion, very close to the estimate of $9.1 billion.\n\nSynergy Research says Amazon has about 33% of the cloud infrastructure market and that it is maintaining that share against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the rest of the pack. This in a market that\u2019s growing 40% per year.\n\nAmazon said its operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $35.3 billion. I caught my shares at about 23.7 times annual cash flow. Net product sales for the quarter were $70 billion, and that was also up 25% from a year ago.\n\nThe earnings shortfall came about for the same reason Amazon was unprofitable until 2015. It is investing ahead of growth. Back then, the investment was in cloud data centers Today its heaviest investment is for warehousing and delivery infrastructure. It wants same-day delivery for orders. That\u2019s crazy. But Amazon is already doing it in many locations.\n\nShares also plunged on what analysts called \u201csoft guidance.\u201d How soft? Christmas quarter sales could be as \u201clow\u201d as $80 billion. The Street estimate is closer to $88 billion. But Amazon has made a habit of low-balling estimates on future earnings and revenue.\n\nAnother reason for the plunge may have been short interest, which was 13.6% of the volume on Oct. 24. It had been at nearly 20% on Oct. 15. The lower the short interest on a stock, the less resistance there is to a plunge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAnother reason for dumping AMZN stock is fear of government intervention. Democratic front-runner Elizabeth Warren has even talked about breaking the company up.\n\nMy response to that is make my day and toss Amazon in that briar patch. Separate Amazon\u2019s retail infrastructure and its media operations from the cloud and you have three monster buys, not one. AWS alone is worth $400 billion at its current run rate. Amazon\u2019s investment in delivery infrastructure means the $180 billion in product sales for this year also deserve a premium multiple.\n\nThen there are Amazon\u2019s services, video, books and music. These all ride on the Amazon cloud. Even if it had to pay a market rate for using that cloud, it would be insanely profitable.\n\nSeparating the infrastructure from Amazon Prime Video means it would have to collect the $10 per month it now shares with Prime Delivery. How many of the 101 million Amazon Prime members would do that? If only half, you\u2019re still taking about $6 billion in revenue.\n\nAmazon has another 32 million people buying Amazon Music and about 3 million buying Kindle Unlimited, which also costs $10 per month. Add that together and it\u2019s a $10.5 billion business. Netflix\u2019s (NASDAQ:NFLX) revenue is about $15.6 billion.\n\nThe Bottom Line on AMZN Stock\n\nAmazon media is worth two-thirds of Netflix\u2019s $121 billion in market cap. The Amazon cloud is worth $400 billion. Amazon\u2019s store and delivery infrastructure is worth another $360 million.\n\nEven broken up, Amazon stock is a bargain. Taken together, it\u2019s a monster. Buy \u2018em up.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
