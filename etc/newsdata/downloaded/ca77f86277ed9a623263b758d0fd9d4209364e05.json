Carsten Bundgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/via REUTERS\n\nIf famed author Salman Rushdie is a dean of the genre, perhaps it is not surprising that his life exhibits so many similar traits.\n\nTo wit, the struggling young writer penned the classic \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d which would go on not only to win the prestigious Booker Prize, but the \u201cBooker of Bookers,\u201d which pit previous champions against each other.\n\nThen came the fatwa against him in the aftermath of \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d a death sentence from some Islamic authorities, which threw him into daily danger and consumed years of his life.\n\nThe longtime U.S. resident is now enjoying a new high, with his new book \u201cQuichotte\u201d short-listed for another Booker Prize. As part of Reuters Life Lessons series, we sat down with the 72-year-old author to discuss his life on and off the page.\n\nBelow are edited excerpts from the interview.\n\nQ: As a young writer starting out, what was the money situation like?\n\nA: I was broke most of the time. In those days in the UK, you could get a part-time job at an ad agency and work two or three days a week. \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children\u201d took five years to write, and I paid the bills by working at Ogilvy & Mather.\n\nQ: What was it like to go from scraping by, to being a smash?\n\nA: It was completely unexpected. I wasn\u2019t even sure who would publish it. When it did come out, even then I didn\u2019t expect it to become a global bestseller. That changed my life, and I was so grateful. It gave me the ability to sit at home and work, which for a writer is almost a miracle.\n\nQ: Did you make any money mistakes, once you became a success?\n\nA: I\u2019ve always been quite sensible about money. I didn\u2019t buy any fast cars, for instance \u2013 I bought an ordinary Citroen. Even if I had the money, I never wanted a Lamborghini. I don\u2019t have extravagant tastes, and I never have had.\n\nQ: With the fatwa, what did you learn about enduring in an impossible situation?\n\nA: Until you\u2019re placed in a position like that, of extreme pressure, you don\u2019t really know how you are going to react. It\u2019s impossible to know in advance. What I learned about myself is that I was able to endure, and fight back, and come out on the other end, and not be crazy. That was a surprise to me. Everyone has a resilience that you might not suspect yourself of having.\n\nQ: Some of your philanthropic money has been devoted to school lunches in South Africa \u2013 why is that?\n\nA: A friend of mine started a charity called The Lunchbox Fund, which gives a healthy midday meal to schoolkids in the poorest areas of South Africa. Truancy rates in the townships had been very high. If you tell students they are going to have a big lunch, then they stay in class and get an education. It\u2019s an impressively simple idea.\n\nQ: What life lessons do you try to pass on to your own children?\n\nA: Kindness and hard work. Fortunately for me, both of my sons are very kind and are working hard at things they love. Neither of them followed in my footsteps, though. They are carving out lives for themselves that are anything but literary.\n\nMy oldest son has a public relations and event management firm, and my younger son is completing a diploma in music production and sound engineering. That\u2019s where they are passionate.\n\nQ: Since we are in unique times, both in the U.S. and the UK, any lessons to be learned from these strange political moments?\n\nA: With Brexit, I\u2019ve always been strongly against it. I would love to feel that this juggernaut heading off the edge of a cliff can still be stopped. Maybe it can\u2019t be, but I live in hope.\n\nAs for Trump, I feel the way for the country to regain its real self is to defeat him. I dread to think what would happen if he were re-elected. Next November will be a real turning point in the U.S. People will have to decide what kind of country they want to live in.", "description": "Magic realism is a literary genre in which narrative is shot through with surreal, dreamlike, seemingly impossible moments.", "authors": ["Chris Taylor", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428018806&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881GV", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
