A recently resurfaced 2014 music video for Hilltop Hoods song Cosby Sweater (pictured) shows the star almost looking like a different person with full brunette hair\n\nAnna has been modelling for 10 years and featured alongside dancer Mina Imsirovic and rappers Trials, K21 and Adam Briggs in the video from six years ago.\n\nShe is seen in the video with full brunette hair while dancing in a knitted dress.\n\nThe 27-year-old told TV Week she has enjoyed a great career and even competed in competitions such as Miss Universe Australia and Miss World Australia.\n\n'I've travelled, done campaigns, I lived in Hong Kong for three months. I've done shoots all over Australia. I've been in music videos. It's been fun.'\n\nNot her first rodeo: The 27-year-old said she has enjoyed a great career and even competed in competitions such as Miss Universe Australia and Miss World Australia before she appeared on the show\n\nAnna, who is partnered with Josh Packham on the show, said her long career has prepared her for the difficulties of reality TV.\n\n'I think it makes you have a really thick skin. I can take criticism really well and I don't take things to heart too much which I think will be good for the show, hopefully,' she said.\n\n'Modelling is full of rejection. I'm used to that. I can deal with it.'\n\nAnna has dealt with plenty of drama this season after five \"bomb squad\" girls were sent in to tempt the contestant's partners causing Anna to break down on the show.\n\n'Literally the moment another girl comes in there, they will be all swayed.' she said.\n\nThankfully she did not have much to worry about as her and Josh shared a touching reunion after the intruders went home.", "description": "A recently resurfaced 2014 music video for Hilltop Hoods song Cosby Sweater shows Love Island's\u00a0Anna McEvoy (right) almost looking like a different person to her current appearance (left).", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/07/20314354-0-image-a-6_1572335581870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
