The way we coped with that and didn\u2019t react to certain tackles, I thought it was a professional performance,\u201d Ings added.\n\n\u201cI thought they really dug in when the pressure was on us and the crowd was electric. So it was difficult and it\u2019s a great night for all of us players, the coaching staff and the fans. It was huge and we knew that going into it.\u201d", "description": "Southampton's Danny Ings said he needed no extra motivation for Tuesday's League Cup clash against south coast derby rivals Portsmouth as he struck a brace to give his team their first win at Fratton Park in 35 years.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433597754&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O065", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
