On appeal, Uber was granted a 15-month provisional licence.\n\nTfL said its initial decision not to licence Uber had led the firm to improve its culture and governance.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \u201cUber London Ltd has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.\u201d\n\nThe two-month licence will have additional conditions attached to ensure passenger safety, covering ride-sharing, insurance and checks on driver\u2019s documentation by Uber.\n\nThe terms of the 15-month licence granted by magistrates last year will continue to apply, obliging Uber to produce an independently verified assurance report every six months, elect three non-executive directors to its board, give TfL four weeks\u2019 notice of any changes to its operate model, and to report any potentially criminal complaints from passengers to the Metropolitan police.\n\nIn July this year Uber was fined \u00a328,800 for two counts of its drivers operating without insurance and for failing to keep proper records.\n\nUber said it had made progress, including more checks on driver hours and additional safety measures for passengers. Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said: \u201cTfL\u2019s recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London. We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution.\n\n\u201cWe will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London.\u201d\n\nBlack cab drivers said the ruling showed Uber should not be trusted by Londoners. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said: \u201cGranting Uber a two-month temporary licence clearly shows that the firm have failed their probation and are still a huge threat to public safety.\n\n\u201cOver the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator\u2019s licence ever shows the mayor doesn\u2019t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the mayor pulled the plug on Uber\u2019s immoral operation for good.\u201d\n\nThe GMB union, which represents minicab drivers, said Uber had had \u201cmore chances than a game of Monopoly\u201d. Steve Garelick, regional officer, criticised the decision: \u201cA two-month licence extension is no good for anyone \u2013 it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he backed TfL\u2019s decision. He said: \u201cSadiq has been crystal clear that in London it doesn\u2019t matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules.\u201d", "description": "Transport for London again rejects ride-hailing firm\u2019s application for a full licence", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36c547748da29e60312c62bcaab80894537d68e/136_214_3309_1987/master/3309.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a49f16780c42d4eafa6334c36903888", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
