Ford said the replacement parts should be good for at least 40,000 miles and that a permanent solution is in development. The vehicles subject to the recall were built from Jan. 17, 2014, to June 15, 2017.\n\nFord is also recalling 366 2019 Edge models to replace seatbelt anchors and a total of 18 Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator full-size SUVs that possibly left the factory with suspension parts that weren\u2019t securely fastened.\n\nThere are no known accidents or injuries related to any of the issues.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "No injuries reported.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
