REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s Competition Tribunal on Wednesday said it was looking into allegations by South African alcoholic drinks firm Distell Group that the entity formed from the 2016 merger of the world\u2019s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev with SABMiller breached merger conditions.\n\nAB InBev and SABMiller were not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nDistell approached the Competition Commission with allegations that the merged entity removed competitors\u2019 advertising material from retail outlets, among others, the tribunal said in a statement, adding that the Commission found there was no breach.\n\nDistell has now asked for a detailed review and for a full investigation to be conducted, the competition regulator said.\n\nThe tribunal said that it will consider Distell\u2019s submissions during a hearing scheduled for Thursday and Friday.\n\nSABMiller argues that Distell\u2019s complaint is an \u201cattempt to restrict competition and is unrelated to the merger conditions\u201d and that the complaints \u201chave no merit and should be dismissed,\u201d the tribunal added.\n\nSouth Africa cleared Anheuser-Busch Inbev's $100 billion-plus deal to acquire SABMiller in 2016 here. The sale of SABMiller's Distell stake was a condition of the Competition Tribunal's approval of the merger.\n\nThe merger brought together AB InBev\u2019s Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona brands with SABMiller\u2019s Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell and brews almost a third of the world\u2019s beer, dwarfing rivals Heineken and Carlsberg.", "description": "South Africa's Competition Tribunal on Wednesday said it was looking into allegations by South African alcoholic drinks firm Distell Group that the entity formed from the 2016 merger of the world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev with SABMiller breached merger conditions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428976946&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0EH-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
