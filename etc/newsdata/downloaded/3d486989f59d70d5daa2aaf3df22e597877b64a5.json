It's time for that to end'", "language": "en", "text": "The spark that lit the flame was a 3% hike in subway fares, but after 12 days of mass protests and street violence, Chile\u2019s worst unrest in decades has transformed into a nationwide uprising demanding dramatic changes to the country\u2019s economic and political system.\n\nEighteen people have died in the violence and 7,000 have been arrested amid widespread outbreaks of violence and arson, and credible allegations of human rights abuses by the security forces.\n\nHow Pinochet's economic model led to the current crisis engulfing Chile Read more\n\nThe leaderless movement has forced the billionaire president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, on the defensive, prompting him to replace eight ministers and announce a string of emergency measures including a small increase in the minimum wage and higher taxes on wealthy Chileans.\n\nBut such moves have not been enough to defuse the protests, which are driven by deep-rooted disillusionment over inequality that has left millions of citizens frozen out of Chile\u2019s economic rise.\n\nOne per cent of Chile\u2019s population earns 33% of the nation\u2019s wealth, making it the most unequal country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of nations.\n\nMany protesters are calling for a new constitution to replace the one written in 1980 during the reign of August Pinochet, which created the legal basis for a market-driven economic model that has privatized pensions, health and education.\n\nJuan \u00c1ngel, 60, school teacher\n\n\u201cI want change and I want it now. The cost of living keeps rising and our money is badly distributed \u2013 in pensions, in healthcare and in education. There is privilege for armed forces, the priests, the politicians, the corporations. And to change that? You have to change the constitution.\n\n\u201cThis is a small country, we have natural resources. This could be a prosperous country if our riches were better distributed. We could be marvelous. A country that is prosperous and happy and in peace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I have nothing to lose. I\u2019m doing this for my granddaughter who is six months old.\u201d\n\nMelissa Medina, 25, makeup artist\n\n\u201cMy grandmother fought against the dictatorship; my mother fought in her time; I am the mother of a six-year-old girl and now it\u2019s my turn to protest.\n\n\u201cWe want long-term changes that I hope she will enjoy in 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe have shitty wages and 12-hour shifts. It takes me two hours to get back from work, and when I get home I don\u2019t see my daughter because she is asleep.\n\nChilean president cancels Apec and climate summits amid wave of unrest Read more\n\n\u201cMarching with us, there are children, students, workers, parents, aunts, grandmothers. Grandmothers screaming for change! At their age and still fighting.\n\n\u201cLook at us: we carry spoons and pots and pans [to rattle in protest]. We have water and baking soda to combat the effects of teargas.\n\n\u201cAnd they have buckshot, teargas, lockups, police brutality, rapes, tortures \u2013 so who is still winning and who is still losing? The fight must go on.\n\n\u201cMaybe nothing positive will come out of this, and we will win nothing. But I don\u2019t want to wait until I\u2019m 50 and realize I wasn\u2019t brave enough. I screamed and I fought. I ran from the police, I got shot in the leg. Next, it\u2019s going to be my daughter\u2019s turn. I hope she doesn\u2019t have to fight.\u201d\n\nAntonia del Almendro, 25, film-maker\n\n\u201cThe people are tired of being treated like slaves or criminals. If you don\u2019t have an important last name or don\u2019t have money you are nothing.\n\n\u201cThe first demand is to change the constitution: we are the only country in Latin America that has the same constitution it had under a dictatorship. We have the same laws and the same economic model brought in by the dictatorship. And we are seeing that they still violate human rights like they did under the dictatorship.\n\n\u201cIt is incredible how they think we are stupid. But people woke up and are showing the government that we are not stupid: they won\u2019t be sticking their finger down our throats ever again.\u201d\n\nGerm\u00e1n David Requena Zeta, 18, student\n\n\u201cAs a student it\u2019s very expensive to live here in Santiago. My parents and I are from northern Chile, so I live here alone.\n\n\u201cI am fighting for a better education that costs less, a subway fare that is fair, and a life with more dignity. Because what we earn now is not enough to survive on. I want to become [economically] independent but I can\u2019t \u2013 life it is just too expensive. I want to be a student, to live in peace \u2013 these are little things.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of the police\u2013 even though many people have been wounded, and others have been killed. I just don\u2019t understand why they attack us with so much force.\u201d\n\nMar\u00eda Borgo\u00f1o, 32, art history student\n\n\u201cThe people who run the government are the same people who have economic power, it is a perfect circle: they pass laws to make more money, and the rest of us become poorer.\n\n\u201cDuring the protests the government has killed people, women have been raped, men have been raped. Many have lost eyes while they protested peacefully.\n\n\u201cHuman rights have not been truly respected since the dictatorship. We are subjugated by the rich \u2013and now it is time for that to end. It\u2019s time for the people to have a kind of life that makes them want to live.\n\n\u201cPeople live with a lot of stress: they\u2019re in debt to the banks and businesses \u2013 and then spend that money in the same businesses in order to live.\u201d\n\nCristian Quiroga, 43, television camera assistant\n\n\u201cI want the government and big business to stop looting my country \u2013 to stop taking what belongs to all of us and selling it to the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cThey make deals made for the copper, the water, the lithium, the ocean \u2013 everything is up for sale and flogged off for a pittance to other countries. And none of the cash comes down to us.\n\n\u201cThe Chilean people have changed their way of thinking because of social media and the internet. Chile has changed; the people are more liberal. But labor laws and our education system have not changed in 30 years. If we do get a new constitution? I\u2019ll go out with my broom and my rags, and I\u2019ll help clean the streets and repaint the country.\u201d\n\nTammy Cabezas, 21\n\n\u201cI came out to represent trans people. The average life expectancy of a trans person in Chile is 35, and demands that many are fighting for \u2013 like a decent pension \u2013 we can\u2019t even dream of that. We are protesting because without a sexual revolution there is no social revolution.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to see Pi\u00f1era and his ministers in prison for all that they have done \u2013 and that there is a law protecting trans and non-binary people.\n\n\u201cI never imagined the protests would reach this size. Things were bad: people were dying; trans people were dying; the [indigenous] Mapuches were dying \u2013 and in the end the people woke up and realized this was wrong.\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, the people have the power. And the government has to listen to us.\u201d", "description": "Chile\u2019s worst unrest in decades has transformed into a nationwide uprising for change.
