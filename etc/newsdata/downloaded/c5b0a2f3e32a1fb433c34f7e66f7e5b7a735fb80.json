Two of those sources said that State Department officials, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, are also open to weighing the French proposal, in which the Paris government would effectively ease the economic sanctions regime that the Trump administration has applied on Tehran for more than a year.\n\nThe deal put forward by France would compensate Iran for oil sales disrupted by American sanctions. A large portion of Iran\u2019s economy relies on cash from oil sales. Most of that money is frozen in bank accounts across the globe. The $15 billion credit line would be guaranteed by Iranian oil. In exchange for the cash, Iran would have to come back into compliance with the nuclear accord it signed with the world\u2019s major powers in 2015. Tehran would also have to agree not to threaten the security of the Persian Gulf or to impede maritime navigation in the area. Lastly, Tehran would have to commit to regional Middle East talks in the future.\n\nWhile Trump has been skeptical of helping Iran without preconditions in public, the president has at least hinted at an openness to considering Macron\u2019s pitch for placating the Iranian government\u2014a move intended to help bring the Iranians to the negotiating table and to rescue the nuclear agreement that Trump and his former national security adviser John Bolton worked so hard to torpedo.\n\nAt the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France last month, Trump told reporters that Iran might need a \u201cshort-term letter of credit or loan\u201d that could \u201cget them over a very rough patch.\u201d\n\nWhy Trump Wants the Ayatollah\u2019s Cash\n\nIranian Prime Minister Javad Zarif made a surprise appearance at that meeting. To Robert Malley, who worked on Iran policy during the Obama administration, that visit indicated that \u201cTrump must have signaled openness to Macron\u2019s idea, otherwise Zarif would not have flown to Biarritz at the last minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, Trump responded to Macron in a way that gave the French president a reason to invite Zarif, and Zarif a reason to come,\u201d he said.\n\nThe French proposal would require the Trump administration to issue waivers on Iranian sanctions. That would be a major departure from the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign to exact financial punishments on the regime in Tehran. Ironically, during his time in office, President Barack Obama followed a not-dissimilar approach to bring the Iranians to the negotiating table, throttling Iran\u2019s economy with sanctions before pledging relief for talks. The negotiations resulted in the Iran nuke deal that President Trump called \u201crotten\u201d\u2014and pulled the U.S. out of during his first term.\n\nTrump\u2019s flirtations with\u2014if not outright enthusiasm toward\u2014chummily sitting down with foreign dictators and America\u2019s geopolitical foes are largely driven by his desire for historic photo ops and to be seen as the dealmaker-in-chief. It\u2019s a desire so strong that it can motivate him to upturn years of his own administration\u2019s policymaking and messaging.\n\nAnd while President Trump has not agreed to anything yet, he did signal a willingness to cooperate on such a proposal at various times throughout the last month, including at the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, according to four sources with knowledge of the president\u2019s conversations about the deal.\n\nSeveral sources told The Daily Beast that foreign officials are expecting Trump to either agree to cooperate on the French deal or to offer to ease some sanctions on Tehran. Meanwhile, President Trump is also considering meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\n\u201cI do believe they\u2019d like to make a deal. If they do, that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s great too,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut they have tremendous financial difficulty, and the sanctions are getting tougher and tougher.\u201d When asked if he would ease sanctions against Iran in order to get a meeting with Iran Trump simply said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. I think Iran has a tremendous, tremendous potential.\u201d", "description": "NICHOLAS KAMMPresident Donald Trump has left the impression with foreign officials, members of his administration, and others involved in Iranian negotiations that he is actively considering a French plan to extend a $15 billion credit line to the Iranians if Tehran comes back into compliance with the", "authors": ["Erin.Banco Thedailybeast.Com", "Erin Banco", "Asawin.Suebsaeng Thedailybeast.Com", "Asawin Suebsaeng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sKdL_KphrtVlQ3DAoZBkAQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/a2e498d47ec432b7247a2056e2f26a3a", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
