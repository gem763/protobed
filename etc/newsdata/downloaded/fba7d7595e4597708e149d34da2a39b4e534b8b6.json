Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during a Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nThis time it was Sen. Elizabeth Warren fielding attacks from all sides as the Democratic candidates vigorously debated Medicare-for-all in their fourth primary debate.\n\nTheir differences over how to expand health coverage have been on display in all the previous debates, but last night the candidates especially tried to portray the Massachusetts senator who has been rising in the polls as cagey or extreme on the issue.\n\nDespite the pressure, Warren again refused to say whether Medicare-for-all would result in higher taxes for the middle class or talk specifically about how it would eliminate employer-sponsored coverage for 160 million Americans. She notably vowed that her plan would not raise overall costs for the middle-class, and evaded the specific issue of taxes.\n\n\u201cSo my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot.\u201d\n\nNew York Times's Margot Sanger-Katz:\n\nWarren is doing a careful dance here. Focusing on whose \u201ccosts\u201d will go up under \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and not saying whose taxes will be affected. \u2014 Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) October 16, 2019\n\nCNN's MJ Lee:\n\nThe difference between basically every other policy plan that Warren is confident defending vs. Medicare for All? Medicare for All isn't Warren's own plan. She does not have a health care plan of her own. \u2014 MJ Lee (@mj_lee) October 16, 2019\n\nHuffPost's Amanda Terkel:\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Warren is the frontrunner now! Everyone is going after her. In the past debates, she was near the top, but didn\u2019t have to take all the hits. \u2014 Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) October 16, 2019\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg slammed Warren for refusing to get specific about how she\u2019d fund Medicare-for-all and for advocating a single, government plan everyone would have to enroll in.\n\n\u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nPolitico's Elena Schneider:\n\nThe Warren v. Buttigieg face-off is here.\n\n\n\nWarren says Buttigieg's Medicare for all who want it \"is \"Medicare for all who can afford it, and that's the problem we've got.\" \u2014 Elena Schneider (@ec_schneider) October 16, 2019\n\nEven Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2013 the candidate Warren has most closely aligned with on Medicare-for-all \u2013 gave a subtle jab.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey will go up significantly for the wealthy.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) suggested Warren wasn\u2019t being \u201chonest\u201d in how she talks about the issue.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nVox's Ezra Klein:\n\nOne difference between Sanders and Warren is that Sanders recognizes that if you want to build a much bigger social safety net, you need to be willing to argue that higher taxes are worth it, including for the middle class. He's right about that. \u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) October 16, 2019\n\nPBS News Hour's Yamiche Alcindor:\n\nWOAH. ANOTHER BIG MOMENT.\n\n\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar just accused Sen. Elizabeth Warren of essentially peddling a \"pipe dream\" with her healthcare plan rather than a plan that can be realistically implemented. \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) October 16, 2019\n\nCompared to the first primary debate in June, the candidates by now have more clearly-defined positions on how to achieve universal health coverage. As in past debates, they were eager to differentiate themselves on exactly how they\u2019d expand coverage to the uninsured and improve coverage for those who already have it.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has proposed a version of Medicare-for-all that would involve private insurers administering it. Buttigieg wants to keep workplace coverage but let anyone buy into Medicare, in his \u201cMedicare-for-all-who-want-it\u201d plan. Former vice president Joe Biden has laid out how he\u2019d provide a government-backed plan through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nBiden recited his now-familiar lines about expanding the ACA versus trying to overhaul the whole system. He also lobbed pointed attacks at Medicare-for-all, alleging it would raise taxes by about $5,000 a year for people making in between $50,000 and $75,000.\n\n\u201cOn the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.\u201d\n\nSanders and Warren, who are aligned on the most expansion version of Medicare-for-all, have faced tricky questions of how they\u2019d pay for it and why they would need to do away with the private health insurance industry.\n\nTheir most effective response has been to point to systemic and widely-acknowledged problems in the country\u2019s health-care system. Last night, Warren returned again and again to the theme of bankruptcy stemming from medical bills (we recently wrote a Health 202 about this very problem), saying she has heard from people with multiple sclerosis, diabetes and cancer about the costs they incurred.\n\n\u201cThey all had great health insurance right at the beginning,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.\u201d\n\nOur Post colleague Robert Costa:\n\nWarren continues to get a lot of space and time to flesh out position. She doesn't take on other candidates directly, sticks to policy. Keeps hammering her position. A reminder that her ascent in polls has come amid a message-centric strategy and not about big moments/sparring. \u2014 Robert Costa (@costareports) October 16, 2019\n\nHere are some other key health-related moments from the debate:\n\nCANDIDATES AND THEIR HEALTH: Sanders, 78, said he was \u201chealthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d when asked how he can assure voters he's fit to tackle the presidency after his heart attack earlier this month. He plugged an upcoming campaign rally in New York -- where, as our Post colleagues Sean Sullivan and Dave Weigel scoop, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plans to endorse the Vermont senator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,\" Sanders said. \"That is how I can reassure the American people.\u201d He thanked people who supported him during his recovery. \u201cLet me take this moment to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here for their love, for their prayers, and their well-wishes\u2026 I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nPolitical strategist Caleb Hull:\n\nCory Booker: \"I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage... when looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\"\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders literally just had a heart attack. pic.twitter.com/5NsS20DpJb \u2014 Caleb SkHull \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@CalebJHull) October 16, 2019\n\nNew York Times political reporter Shane Goldmacher:\n\n\"I'm healthy, I'm feeling great,\" Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nBooker: He's also in favor of medical marijuana.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not on it tonight,\" Sanders retorts. \u2014 Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 16, 2019\n\nLA Times correspondent Matt Pearce:\n\n\"I'm healthy, I'm feeling great,\" says Sanders, to cheers from the audience. One of the bigger stories tonight (in my opinion) isn't really much of a story at all, which is that Sanders looks and sounds like he did before he had a heart attack. \u2014 Matt Pearce \ud83e\udd85 (@mattdpearce) October 16, 2019\n\nBiden, 76, vowed to release his medical records ahead of the Iowa caucuses in February. And 70-year-old Warren, when asked about her age, said: \"I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump or Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.\u201d\n\nHarris and Sanders. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nABORTION: Harris chimed in during the Medicare-for-all debate to point out a lack of questions about states passing new abortion restrictions.\n\nKamala Harris: \"It's not an exaggeration to say women will die \u2014 poor women, women of color will die \u2014 because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nWhen asked about how the candidates would stop laws restricting abortion, Harris said under her administration, the Justice Department would review whether laws comply with Roe v. Wade, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t go into effect.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) joined in: \u201cWe are seeing all over this country, women's reproductive rights under attack and... women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.\" Booker said he would create an Office of Reproductive Freedom, and called for codifying Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Klobuchar also said they would codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nWarren reminded people that even when abortions were illegal, women still had access to the procedure if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal.\n\nRep.Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) said the need for \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d abortions was one area she agreed with Hillary Clinton. She said there should be limits on third-trimester abortions \u201cunless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.\u201d\n\nOPIOID CRISIS: Several candidates called for holding opioid executives accountable and sending them to prison for their role in the opioid crisis.\n\nHarris said she thinks pharmaceutical executives should be locked up. \u201cI do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice understands that you want to deal with who is really a criminal.\u201d\n\nCastro said the executives \u201cneed to be held accountable not only financially but also with criminal penalties.\u201d\n\nBusiness executive Andrew Yang cited Ohio as an epicenter of the crisis, saying there was a \u201cpoint when there were more opioid prescriptions in the state of Ohio than humans in the state of Ohio.\u201d Our fact-checker colleague Salvador Rizzo reports that statistic was accurate. \u201cOhio had a peak of 102.4 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons in 2010, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Ohio\u2019s rate has since declined. In 2017, it was 63.5 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons, but that was still higher than the U.S. average of 58.7,\u201d Rizzo writes.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nAHH: Pete Buttigieg sharpened his aim at rivals Warren and Sanders with a new ad released ahead of last night's debate.\n\nThe ad, titled \u201cMakes More Sense,\u201d cites Buttigieg\u2019s health-care plan, contrasting it with the Medicare-for-all proposal touted by Sanders and Warren and framing the South Bend, Ind. mayor as more moderate on the issue. It features political analysts and television anchors talking about his plan.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare-for-all, where private insurance is abolished,\u201d one commentator says. The ad adds Buttigieg is \u201ctrying to focus on choice, not infringing on people\u2019s freedom to make that decision voluntarily.\u201d\n\n\u2014\"Buttigieg\u2019s campaign said he was not leveling personal attacks, only highlighting his policy differences with others in the field,\" our Post colleague Amy B Wang reports. \"But sometimes the attacks are fairly pointed. On health care, Buttigieg accuses Warren and Sanders of not trusting the American people to choose the right health care plans for themselves. Buttigieg\u2019s plan would create a government-run 'public option' but would not abolish private insurance, allowing people to choose between the two.\"\n\nThe Health 202 wrote last month that Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare-for-all-who-want-it\u201d plan appears to be a riff off the Sanders plan, but actually builds on the Affordable Care Act and looks more like a public option, comparable to the public option plan laid out by Biden.\n\nOxycodone pills. (John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nOOF: A group of state attorneys general failed in a last-minute bid to delay the landmark opioid trial set to begin next week amid discussions about a settlement deal with the nation's three largest drug distributors.\n\nThe state AGs told U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster they were trying to reach an $18 billion settlement with distributors McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, our Post colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Scott Higham, Sari Horwitz and Aaron C. Davis report.\n\nPolster said during a hearing that jury selection will proceed today as scheduled. \"The state attorneys general have filed their own lawsuits against the drug industry for saturating their states with highly addictive pain pills,\" our colleagues write. \"... Lawyers representing the local communities said Tuesday night they are not part of the settlement talks with the distributors.\"\n\nThe bellwether trial, meant to be a test case to determine how other lawsuits against the drug companies might play out, will begin in a Cleveland courtroom next week. There, jury selection will begin to pick the dozen people who will determine if the companies should be held responsible for the epidemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives and left millions addicted.\n\n\u201cDescribed as the most complex litigation ever, the trial will begin to sort out the welter of accusations over the crisis,\u201d Lenny writes. \u201cWhile six drug companies are defendants in the case, jurors also may hear blame cast widely on doctors, government agencies and perhaps even drug users themselves. The jury\u2019s response will help decide who should bear the cost of one of this century\u2019s worst public health crises.\u201d\n\nOUCH: More than 150 cases out of the more than 1,000 people who have been sickened by a vaping-related lung illness are teenagers under the age of 18.\n\nThe news has swept across social media platforms, as teenagers try to warn peers about the illness, sharing images of young patients in hospitals. Still, on those very platforms, others have mocked their classmates for quitting the use of e-cigarettes and vaping products and high school vape dealers have advertised their products.\n\n\u201cThe posts offer a glimpse into the contradictory forces teens face: the draw of nicotine and marijuana, the pressure to fit in and be cool, the inclination to rebel \u2014 and now the potential that vaping, which has become central to adolescent culture in some places, could cause immediate and lethal harm,\u201d our Post colleague Moriah Balingit reports. \u201c\u2026Interviews with pediatricians, public health officials and more than a dozen teenagers reveal that while many young people are trying to quit, others are resistant to the notion that vaping might be dangerous.\u201d\n\nPediatricians are warning that even users who don\u2019t acquire a lung injury could become addicted to the vaping products, as long-term effects are unknown. \u201cBut teens, like many adults, have cherry-picked information to justify continued use,\u201d Moriah writes.\n\nINDUSTRY RX\n\n(iStock)\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s a dearth of women in top roles in the health-care industry, even as there are a lot of women who work in the industry overall. It has the highest share of women who work in entry-level roles, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Lauren Weber reports, citing data from LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co.\n\nBut women make up only 33 percent of the highest levels of the corporate ladder at a sample of 22 companies, and 75 percent of the employees at the lowest rungs of the ladder. That\u2019s compared with men who make up 67 percent of the top leaders and 25 percent of entry-level workers.\n\nThe numbers are lower for women of color. Compared with white women, who make up 29 percent of top roles, women of color make up just 6 percent of C-suite positions.\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nFact Checker Fact-checking the fourth Democratic debate Here's a roundup of eight claims from the fourth Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 campaign.
