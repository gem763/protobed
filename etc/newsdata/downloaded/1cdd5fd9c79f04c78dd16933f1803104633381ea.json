The Perfect singer has made no secret in the past of his interest in Miley, confessing in interviews that she was his \u2018childhood celebrity crush\u2019. It is all very Shakespearean really but we hope it\u2019s not a tragedy. Meanwhile, Miley has been less smitten and more bitten \u2013 by a bout of tonsillitis. The 26-year-old shared some snaps of her looking under the weather as she recuperates: \u2018Tonsillitis is a f***ing f***\u2019. True (Instagram)\n\nAnyone who has ever had tonsillitis would know it totally sucks, and would be even less fun if your career was making music.\n\nGet well soon Miley!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuckily she seems to be getting plenty of care and attention from love \u2018doctor\u2019 Cody while she is on the mend.\n\nAh young love.\n\nDead (Picture: Instagram)\n\nGot a showbiz story?
