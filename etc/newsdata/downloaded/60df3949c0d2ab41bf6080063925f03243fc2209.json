But the plan would be expensive and difficult to execute, given you\u2019d need to win over community groups to erect the extra antennas. And coverage would still be pretty patchy, Wright told the court.\n\nSo to summarise, the evidence from the ACCC\u2019s expert suggested if the merger were blocked, Vodafone would almost immediately need to make itself less competitive by offering customers less data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then TPG could complete the rollout of a 4G network that it says it won\u2019t build, and then spend a lot more money to build a 5G network that would still be pretty uncompetitive.\n\nNow, it should be said that the entire episode of the 4G network would have some TPG investors questioning the market\u2019s \u201cDavid Teoh is a genius\u201d mantra.\n\nIf the 4G network plan was simply a way of forcing Vodafone into a merger, then Teoh has taken a gigantic risk spending $1.26 billion on mobile spectrum that could yet prove useless to TPG.\n\nAnd if he was serious about rolling out a 4G small cell network, then he is taking an equally large risk on a plan with serious limitations.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the guts of this case.\n\nThe ACCC needs to show that blocking this merger will help competition. Wright\u2019s evidence didn\u2019t appear to help do that.", "description": "The ACCC's own expert witness has raised serious concerns about how competitive Vodafone and TPG will be if their merger doesn't go ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7947%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8b6d6cfdd1e3866e0711d2a51f9859acbea0f2d2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
