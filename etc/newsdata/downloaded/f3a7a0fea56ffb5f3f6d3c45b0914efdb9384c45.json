Then, standing in front of the fire, the night before he was due to go home to London, David suddenly said: \u2018About this ring\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018What ring?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, if I were to buy you a ring, what sort would you like? You hated the last one because it had claws.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, I hated it because it wasn\u2019t expensive enough.\u2019\n\nI was shocked he\u2019d mentioned buying a ring, as he hadn\u2019t even brought champagne. And also, crucially, he hasn\u2019t proposed. I think my \u2018yes\u2019 from the last time he asked when we were on a mini-break in Paris five years ago has gone past its sell-by date. I wonder if he\u2019s too scared to propose again. Or is it a ring, but not an engagement ring? I\u2019m reminded of when I was married, and my husband suddenly came into some money, having published his first novel, and took me to a jeweller in Soho so I could choose a ring (he\u2019d never given me an engagement ring, while I\u2019d paid for our wedding bands). I chose one. \u2018Oh no,\u2019 he\u2019d said. \u2018That\u2019s too bridey. How about this friendship one?\u2019\n\nI had to be in London by midday on Monday for work, so we left North Yorkshire at 5am. David sweetly made sandwiches. I\u2019d booked a vegan suite that night at the Hilton Bankside \u2013 bamboo carpet, hemp pillows, headboard fashioned out of pineapple leaves, vegan wine \u2013 and told him that there was no need for him to join me, as he must be tired and his cat must be lonely.\n\n\u2018Oh no, I\u2019ll come too,\u2019 he said.\n\nI sat in the bar that evening, waiting for him. When he spotted me, his face lit up. He is always so pleased to see me. He was wearing a very large brown leather jacket. I\u2019m pretty sure the vegan suite wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\n\u2018What do you think?\u2019 he said, smiling and almost twirling.\n\nI was about to tell him it was too big for him, and way too wintry, but his shiny, tiny eyes stopped me. And thank God they did. It turns out that the jacket belonged to his best friend (and best man), who had recently died. \u2018It was all he left to me.\u2019\n\nHis best friend was a lovely man who lived next door in Brixton with David when I had first fallen in love with him 36 years ago. He always idolised David, who back then was dynamic and glamorous, and he was my partner-in-crime when I was trying to get David to go out with me. \u2018Where is he going?\u2019 I\u2019d ask, after I\u2019d spied David\u2019s retreating back loping down the road towards the tube. \u2018Does he even know I exist?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure he does,\u2019 he\u2019d say reassuringly. \u2018It\u2019s just that as you live next door, he\u2019s worried it will be awkward when he dumps you. Which he surely will.\u2019\n\nStroking his jacket now, I said, \u2018What did he make of you going out with me after all this time?\u2019\n\n\u2018He said he thought you were really good for me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Never mind that. The question is, are you good for me?\u2019\n\nWe didn\u2019t have sex that night, given I was exhausted*. All that longing back in 1983, and now I\u2019m relieved when he starts snoring and I can overdose on Celebrity MasterChef. I gave him the breakfast menu. I love breakfast menus: it\u2019s like writing a letter to Santa. He screwed up his face, \u2018But there\u2019s no milk! I want a normal cappuccino!\u2019\n\nHe was like this in Farmacy, the organic, plant-based restaurant in Notting Hill that is all about wellness: there are so many mums and nannies with prams, I often get entangled, like a dolphin in a net. \u2018Can I have a Coke?\u2019 he\u2019d asked the baffled waitress.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m surprised his friend, almost a decade younger, died first, considering David smokes, doesn\u2019t exercise, eats Revels, and has never drunk a glass of water in his life. I once asked if he\u2019s on some sort of death wish, given when we re-met he rode a motorbike.\n\n\u2018I was, until I fell in love with you. Now I have a reason to live.\u2019\n\nDear God. What a responsibility.\n\nI can\u2019t dump him now, can I?\n\n*And the fact I, crucially, had not had an extreme bikini wax.", "description": "When David came to stay with me for my Birthday Weekend, I kept thinking my real present was going to materialise, but it never did.", "authors": ["Liz Jones Diary For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/14/19156226-0-image-a-7_1569937567554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
