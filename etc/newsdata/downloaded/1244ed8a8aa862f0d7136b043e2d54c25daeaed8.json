Women and minorities serve in key editorial roles at Breitbart.\n\nDespite these facts, which have been confirmed by the New York Times Magazine, the LAPD said it is launching an investigation into how the ad appeared on Breitbart so that it will never happen again.\n\n\u201cWe take matters like this very seriously, and have begun an initial inquiry into the matter and to determine its validity, as well as what future steps can and will be taken to avoid this situation occurring in the future.\u201d\n\nWe take matters like this very seriously, and have begun an initial inquiry into the matter and to determine its validity, as well as what future steps can and will be taken to avoid this situation occurring in the future. \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) September 28, 2019\n\nA separate Twitter account @joinLAPD, which appears to be dedicated to police recruitment, said Saturday that the banner ad appearing on Breitbart was a Google ad.\n\nAutomated programs like Google AdSense serve up ads based on a reader\u2019s past searches. The ad buyer typically purchases ads in bulk and does not specify where the ads should appear on Google\u2019s vast network.\n\nBreitbart reached out to the LAPD through multiple channels immediately upon seeing the series of tweets over the weekend, requesting to speak with top police officials, according to a source close to the matter. But no one from the LAPD acknowledged those repeated requests over the weekend and into Monday morning.\n\nIt remains unclear who wrote the LAPD tweets over the weekend that smeared Breitbart.\n\nLAPD spokesman Josh Rubenstein declined to speak on the record when reached for comment on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nChief Moore could not be reached for comment. Moore said via his official Twitter account that both the LAPD and the city\u2019s personnel department are investigating if the ad was a spoof meant to \u201cdiscredit LAPD.\u201d\n\nMoore did not explain how a recruitment ad appearing on Breitbart would discredit the police department, which includes avid Breitbart readers among the rank-and-file.\n\nWendy Macy, who heads the city\u2019s personnel department, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two departments have given contradictory answers over which of them placed the recruitment ad.\n\nChief Moore said Saturday that the personnel department placed the online ad, not the LAPD. But the personnel department said via Twitter that it \u201chas not made any purchase of LAPD recruitment ads on Breitbart or similar sites.\u201d\n\nBut this week, personnel department spokesman Bruce Whidden told the LA Times that the ad ended up on Breitbart as part of a buy made through Google on Sept. 10 using the department\u2019s marketing money.\n\nWhidden said the department spent $3,000 on Google ads in the purchase, which would come out to $40 a day for the ad to appear on a number of sites, according to the Times.\n\nThe Daily Beast has a history of running negative stories about police officers, often depicting them as racist. The leftist site seldom runs stories spotlighting the hard work police personnel perform on a daily basis.\n\nShachtman, the site\u2019s editor in chief, has publicly made disparaging remarks about conservatives and Republicans.\n\n\u201cISIS and the worst American conservatives hate the same people,\u201d he tweeted in 2016.\n\nISIS and the worst American conservatives hate the same people. https://t.co/CaoE8q47Jk \u2014 Noah Shachtman (@NoahShachtman) April 14, 2016\n\nShachtman once implied that all House Republicans are sexual predators.\n\n\u201cThere were House Republicans who *weren\u2019t* pedophiles, right?\u201d he tweeted in 2015.\n\nThere were House Republicans who *weren't* pedophiles, right? \u2014 Noah Shachtman (@NoahShachtman) May 29, 2015\n\nShachtman has also tweeted obscene comments involving 13-year-old Barron Trump: \u201cImagine you\u2019re Barron Trump \u2026 and you just found your dad fucked pornstars behind your mom\u2019s back when you were just a few months old. Ugh.\u201d\n\nImagine you're Barron Trump \u2026 and you just found your dad fucked pornstars behind your mom's back when you were just a few months old. Ugh. \u2014 Noah Shachtman (@NoahShachtman) January 18, 2018\n\nShactman declined a request for comment about his LAPD tweet.\n\nBreitbart has submitted public records requests to both the LAPD and the city\u2019s personnel department concerning their investigations. California allows them ten days to respond to requests.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
