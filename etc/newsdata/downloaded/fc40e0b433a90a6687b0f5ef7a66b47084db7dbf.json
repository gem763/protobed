I\u2019ve had a lot of stress and I\u2019ve not been to the gym in two weeks, I\u2019ve been unwell all weekend with a chest infection.\n\n\u2018When I come back, I will get back on it, I always come out on top. My life always goes a bit t*ts-up I carry on, I\u2019ve got lots of projects on the table, so it\u2019s exciting.\u2019\n\nGemma had reportedly called the police on 17 October when Arg failed to answer messages from his friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Sun on Sunday, it prompted Gemma to contact the emergency services who then visited the reality star\u2019s home in South Woodford, north London to check he was well.\n\nExplaining the situation, Arg told the publication: \u2018I wasn\u2019t speaking to a certain person so I didn\u2019t reply.\n\nGemma\u2019s been showing off her amazing weight loss (Picture: Ana M.
