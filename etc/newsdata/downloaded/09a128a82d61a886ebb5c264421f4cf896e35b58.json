On the heels of reports that DeLonge has filed for divorce from wife Jennifer Jenkins after 18 years of marriage, comes news that his passion for investigating UFOs has gotten a green light of sorts from the U.S. Navy.\n\nAs Vice\u2019s Motherboard reports, Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher has confirmed that three videos posted by the To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences (TTSA)\u2014 the organization founded by DeLonge in 2015 to pursue research into UFOs and extraterrestrial life \u2014 do indeed show \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those these videos as unidentified,\u201d Gradisher, official spokesperson for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare, told The Black Vault.\n\nRocker Tom DeLonge founded an organization studying extraterrestrial life and UFOs.

Both he and the TTSA tweeted out Vice\u2019s story, prompting praise from fellow UFO buffs \u2014 plus a few jokes and references to the Blink-182 song \u201cAliens Exist.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: The Navy says the UFOs in Tom DeLonge\u2019s videos are \"unidentified aerial phenomena\" https://t.co/SMCYFcMY6Q \u2014 VICE News (@vicenews) September 17, 2019\n\nMore like Blink Area 52 Amirite \u2014 Jamie Pastore (@jamiepastore) September 17, 2019\n\nCongratulations @tomdelonge !!
