The Home Office confirmed that it is aware of the reports and is liaising with its French counterparts.\n\nIt will be the first time that two migrants have been found dead on the same day on northern French shores. Two separate deaths were recorded in August.\n\nThe two men \"probably came from the same boat\", which was found empty next to the body of the younger man, said the French regional security department.\n\nPolice found two oars inside the inflatable dinghy, and a canister of fuel and life vest nearby, security officials for the Pas-de-Calais region told the French station News 24.\n\nA similar boat was found some 450m from the scene but it was not clear if the two were linked.", "description": "The bodies of two young Iraqi migrants suspected of trying to cross the Channel have been found on a beach in northern France.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/22/TELEMMGLPICT000186216593-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO6QpIblidqHYceykOFBymEDlT6p8TPuWfOauUen7XeM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
