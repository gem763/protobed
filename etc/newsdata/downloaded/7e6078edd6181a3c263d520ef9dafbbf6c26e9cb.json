Whether you\u2019re stoked to wait in line for hours to get your hands on the newest digs or you\u2019re just excited because this means the iPhone Xs might get cheaper, you can catch all the Apple updates live tomorrow at 10 a.m. PDT/1 p.m. EST. Make sure to tune in live to catch everything Apple, from their new credit card to a rumored iPad update.\n\nWhen is the Apple 2019 iPhone event?\n\nThe Apple 2019 iPhone event will take place tomorrow, September 10, at the Steve Jobs Auditorium in Cupertino, CA, at 10 a.m. PDT/1 p.m. EST. As in the past, the event will feature a keynote from CEO Tim Cook and be livestreamed, so you don\u2019t have to be an Apple employee or press to get in on the action.\n\nHow can you watch the event livestream?\n\nThere are a few places you can watch the livestream of the event. As in the past, you can always stream it directly from Apple.com \u2014 they\u2019ll even add the event to your calendar for you if you\u2019re a calendar gal like me (and if you\u2019re not, please tell me how the heck your remember all your appointments??). If you won\u2019t have access to a computer or you\u2019re a big fan of YouTube\u2019s streaming platform, you\u2019ll also be able to stream the Apple event on YouTube for the first time ever \u2014 on both your desktop and mobile devices (Apple and Android inclusive!).\n\nWhat can you expect from Tim Cook\u2019s keynote speech?\n\nThere are quite a few rumors going around about what exactly we can expect at tomorrow\u2019s event. We\u2019re almost certain that a new iPhone will be announced, as this is typical for their annual September event, but according to MacRumors we may also see the announcement of a new Apple Watch, a bigger iPad, an updated MacBook, and the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to the forgetful among us (@me), Apple Tag. While all the other announcements will simply be updated versions of previously existing hardware, Apple Tag is a whole new ballgame, offering Bluetooth tracking for all your important items \u2014 from your keys to your wallet.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an Apple fan or not, it\u2019s definitely worth tuning into the livestream tomorrow to see where the future of technology is heading (and maybe figure out what to get your Gen Z brother for Christmas if you don\u2019t feel like tracking down the latest Yeezys).\n\n\n\nLike what you see?
