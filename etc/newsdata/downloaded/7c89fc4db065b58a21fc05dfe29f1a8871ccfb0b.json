That's the decision of the whole family,\" his nephew Leo Mugabe told the AFP news agency.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa had declared Mr Mugabe a national hero after his death, indicating he should be buried at the national monument.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignation\n\nAnalysis By Shingai Nyoka, BBC News, Harare\n\nThe family has prevailed and Zimbabwe's former president, Robert Mugabe, will be buried in his rural home.\n\nThis is a final snub to his former comrades. It is not unprecedented: other national heroes have declined to be buried at the Heroes' Acres national shrine in Harare, but not one of Robert Mugabe's stature.\n\nSpeaking at her mother's funeral last year, Grace Mugabe expressed her desire to reconcile with President Emerson Mnangagwa, the man who ultimately prevailed in the pair's battle to succeed Mr Mugabe as president, with the help of the army. But this decision could strain relations and widen the rift.\n\nIn Harare's Rufaro stadium, where preparations are under way for the arrival of his body, hundreds of mourners in the regalia of the governing Zanu-PF party have arrived. There is a jubilant mood.\n\nBut most of the people I spoke to are Mugabe supporters. One woman supported the family's decision for a private burial.\n\n\"The way they got rid of him was not right, it was cruel,\" she said.\n\nAnother mourner said she believed the former president needed to be buried with his family rather than with his comrades.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Mugabe's body arrived home in Zimbabwe on Wednesday ahead of a state funeral\n\nEducation Minister Paul Mavhima says there is no doubt Mr Mugabe should be buried as a national hero.\n\n\"Such an icon, one whose funeral service is going to be attended by almost 50 current and former heads of state. Such a founding father of this country, there should never be a discussion about that. There should never be any conflict whatsoever. The decision should be clear, he should go to the national shrine,\" he told the BBC.\n\nIn a statement, the Mugabe family said it was extremely concerned over the way the authorities had made funeral plans \"without consulting his immediate family who were tasked with communicating his last wishes in regard to his funeral and burial\".\n\n\"We have also observed with shock that the government of Zimbabwe is attempting to coerce us to accept a programme for the funeral and burial of the late Robert Gabriel Mugabe which is contrary to his wishes on how he wished to have his mortal remains interred.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Mugabe's coffin at his Blue Roof residency in Harare\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Zimbabwe's former first lady Grace Mugabe at the Mugabe residency in Harare\n\nThe statement adds that one of the late leader's final wishes was for his wife, Grace Mugabe, to never leave Mr Mugabe's casket during the funeral up until the point when he is buried.\n\nMr Mugabe's family is said to be bitter over him being ousted by his former ally Mr Mnangagwa two years ago.\n\nMr Mugabe fired Mr Mnangagwa in 2017, in what many believed was a way to prepare for Mrs Mugabe to succeed him.\n\nHis body was flown back to Zimbabwe from Singapore on Wednesday. It was later taken to Mr Mugabe's Harare villa, known as the Blue Roof, where family and supporters gathered to mourn.\n\nIt will lie in state at Rufaro football stadium for two days, ahead of the state funeral on Saturday.\n\nMr Mugabe was Zimbabwe's first leader after the country became independent in 1980. He held on to power for almost four decades before being ousted in the 2017 coup.", "description": "The family of Zimbabwe's ousted strongman says they are not being consulted over funeral plans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12A9E/production/_108764467_056445498-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
