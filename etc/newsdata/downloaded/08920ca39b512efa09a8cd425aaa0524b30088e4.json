That put the Liberals far short of the 170 seats needed for a second straight majority government.\n\n\u201cYou did it, my friends. Congratulations,\u201d Trudeau told supporters in Montreal early on Tuesday, speaking as his main opponents were giving concession speeches.\n\nTrudeau, who took power in 2015 as a charismatic figure promising \u201csunny ways,\u201d saw his popularity drop over old photos of him in blackface and his handling of a corporate corruption case. He will now have to rely on the New Democratic Party (NDP) to push through key legislation.\n\nAlthough the NDP had a disappointing night, with the 24 seats it had won or was leading in down sharply from the 2015 election when it won 44, the party could exercise significant influence over Trudeau\u2019s next government.\n\n\u201cI think a Liberal government supported by the NDP is likely going to lean farther left,\u201d said John Manley, a former Liberal finance minister who now works in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt raises a series of issues about what are the demands that an NDP party would make. What\u2019s the price of governing going to be? I think businesses are going to be reluctant to make any moves until they get some satisfaction around that.\u201d\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he had spoken with Trudeau and\n\ntold him his party would be \u201cworking hard to deliver on making sure we deliver the priorities that Canadians have.\u201d\n\nMinority governments in Canada rarely last more than 2-1/2 years.\n\nAhead of the vote, opinion polls showed a tight race between Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.\n\n\u201cTonight we have put him on notice,\u201d Scheer said in Regina, Saskatchewan, of Trudeau. \u201cHis leadership is damaged and his government will end soon and when that time comes, we will be ready and we will win.\n\n\u201cWe are the government in waiting,\u201d added Scheer, 40, whose party won 122 seats.\n\nTrudeau, 47, who has championed diversity as prime minister, was endorsed by former U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world\u2019s major democracies.\n\nBut the son of the late Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, whose relationship with Trudeau has been testy at times, congratulated him \u201con a wonderful and hard fought victory\u201d via Twitter.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois saw its support jump in Quebec, the only place where the separatist party contests elections. It was elected or ahead in 32 seats, more than three times what the party won in 2015.\n\n\u201cDear Quebecers, I heard your message tonight,\u201d said Trudeau, who also addressed voters in two western provinces where Liberals were shut out of seats.\n\n\u201cTo Canadians in Alberta and Saskatchewan, know that you are an essential part of our great country. I\u2019ve heard your frustration and I want to be there to support you. Let us all work hard to bring our country together,\u201d he said.\n\nLiberal leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauwaves to supporters after the federal election at the Palais des Congres in Montreal, Quebec, Canada October 22, 2019.

Alberta is at risk of a broader separatist movement and that would be a major negative for Canada.\u201d\n\nWESTERN ANGER\n\nTwo Liberal Cabinet ministers lost their seats in western Canada, including veteran Ralph Goodale, the public safety minister. Anger at Trudeau has mounted in the oil-producing region over federal environmental policies that the energy industry says will harm output.\n\nThe oil industry\u2019s top lobbying group has blamed Trudeau\u2019s policies for throttling investment in the sector, and some global energy companies have shed assets in the oil sands region of Alberta, the country\u2019s main oil-producing province.\n\nCanada\u2019s economy, however, has been on a general upswing in 2019. The Canadian dollar has been the best-performing G10 currency this year, rising more than 4% against its U.S. counterpart, as the economy added jobs at a robust pace and inflation stayed closed to the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2% target.\n\nThe six-week official campaign period was a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides in the G7 country.\n\nThe liberal image of Trudeau, whose father opened the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.\n\nTrudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nScheer also proved to be a determined opponent, although his hopes for a major breakthrough were dashed.\n\nHe had promised to balance the federal budget and eliminate a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d on fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cThe Tories made a fundamental mistake by being opposed to the carbon tax,\u201d said Hugh Segal, who was chief of staff to former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often heard it said the worst mistake a party can make is to get sucked into its own low expectations of the population,\u201d he said.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals held onto power after a closely fought election on Monday but were reduced to a minority government that will need the support in Parliament of a smaller left-leaning party.", "authors": ["Nelson Wyatt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443615075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0FR", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
