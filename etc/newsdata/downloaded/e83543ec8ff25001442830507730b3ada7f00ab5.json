Newton\n\nWater is the enemy of crisp, perfectly golden brown roasted vegetables\u2014which sucks, because vegetables contain a lot of it. If you\u2019re all about those crispy edges, try reaching for a cooling rack. More air circulation means all that water will actually evaporate, so your vegetables turn out crispy every single time.\n\nIt\u2019s basically that simple, but there are a few tricks to make the most of this technique. First, don\u2019t be afraid to really whack up that oven temperature: 220\u00baC-235\u00baC is the sweet spot. As for prep, thin slices of veg work better than big chunks. The delicata squash in the photos was tender and delicious, but it would have actually gotten crispy if I\u2019d made 0.5 centimetre slices instead of 1 centimetre.\n\nAlso, be sure to toss your veg with plenty of oil\u2014even a little more than you\u2019d usually use. Without a hot pan to encourage browning, each piece of veg needs a generous coating of fat so they crisp up instead of dehydrating and turning into vegetable leather.\n\nYou can toss just about any vegetable on a rack, but I\u2019ve found that the, uh, wetter the vegetable, the better it takes to this preparation. (If you\u2019ve ever opened the oven to check on roasted veg and gotten a lungful of steam, you know what I mean.)\n\nCrucifers like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage have been the most successful\u2014I mean, just look at those florets!\u2014but sweet potatoes and carrots work great, too. Add a bit of cornstarch or baking powder and you\u2019re well on your way to crispy roasted veggie heaven.", "description": "Water is the enemy of crisp, perfectly golden brown roasted vegetables\u2014which sucks, because vegetables contain a lot of it.
