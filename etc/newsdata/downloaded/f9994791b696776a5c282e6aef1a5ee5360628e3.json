She was last seen dining with Zepeda at a restaurant a short drive from Besancon.\n\nIn the early hours of the following morning, fellow students heard cries and thuds coming from the area of her room but her disappearance was not reported for several days, by which time Zepeda had returned to Chile.\n\nFrance issued an international warrant for Zepeda's arrest but a Chilean judge in February 2017 rejected the request to arrest him, citing insufficient evidence.\n\nThe suspect was questioned on April 18 by a Chilean judge in the presence of French investigators, including Manteaux. Zepeda denies any hand in Kurosaki's disappearance.\n\nZepeda, who had threatened Kurosaki in a video posted online which he later removed, admits going to her room on the night of her death for what he described as consensual sex and says he left straight afterwards.\n\nNo blood was found inside Kurosaki's room when police searched it 10 days later.\n\n- Soil found in car -\n\nInvestigators suspect that Zepeda, who had questioned a doctor cousin of his about the principles of suffocation, strangled his ex.\n\nThe pair met in 2014 in Japan, where Zepeda was a student, and a year later began a relationship that ended after Kurosaki moved to France in August 2016.\n\nIn Besancon, Kurosaki entered a new relationship, a development which \"clearly exasperated Nicolas Zepeda\", according to Manteaux.\n\nIn the days before her disappearance, Zepeda flew to France, hired a car and drove to Besancon, stopping on the way to buy matches, flammable liquid and bleach at a supermarket.\n\nWhen he returned his hire car three days after Kurosaki's disappearance, it was \"very dirty\" with soil found on the driver's side and in the trunk, Manteaux said.\n\nFor several days after her disappearances, messages continued to be sent from Kurosaki's phone to her friends and family, including messages in Japanese.\n\nA Japanese friend of Zepeda told police he had asked her to translate sentences into Japanese, which later appeared in one of the messages sent from the missing woman's phone.", "description": "French investigators have issued a request for the extradition of a Chilean man suspected of murdering his Japanese ex-girlfriend in the eastern French city...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/wire-19544456-1570718871-775_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
