Companies like Anheuser-Busch BUD, -0.05% and Venmo pledged to match the donations, which have topped more than $1 million.\n\nBut then the Des Moines Register dredged up a couple of racist tweets that King, now 24, had posted when he was 16, during what it described as a \u201croutine background check\u201d of the subject\u2019s social media history. They included \u201cone comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust,\u201d according to the paper.\n\nKing did not respond to a MarketWatch request for comment on Wednesday. He told the Register on Tuesday that the tweets are \u201cnot something that I\u2019m proud of at all.\u201d He also apologized in a press conference to local TV stations on Tuesday, saying, \u201cI am embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old.\u201d He has since deleted the tweets, and shared his full mea culpa online:\n\nLast week, King told MarketWatch about how he had held up the joke \u201cBusch Light Supply Needs Replenished\u201d sign asking for people to Venmo him beer money during a University of Iowa vs. Iowa State football game. But after it got picked up by ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d broadcast, and donations started flooding in, he decided to do something more than buy a case of suds with the sudden windfall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s turned into something really cool, and a way to help families and to help the kids,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to see what kind of a difference you can make when people band together.\u201d\n\nRead more: This 24-year-old has raised more than $600,000 for charity \u2014 by asking for beer money on national TV\n\nBut after news of King\u2019s inappropriate tweets spread on Twitter TWTR, -0.55% and Facebook FB, -0.52% on Tuesday, Anheuser-Busch announced in a statement that it will \u201chave no further association\u201d with him, although the brewer still promised to honor its donation pledge.\n\n\u201cCarson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him,\u201d reads the statement provided to MarketWatch. \u201cWe are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.\u201d But giving King a year\u2019s supply of free beer, or putting his face on future Busch Light cans, is now off the table.\n\nVenmo, owned by PayPal PYPL, -0.31%, told MarketWatch by email that, \u201cVenmo\u2019s decision to match the money raised for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital was inspired by the kindness of the entire Venmo community and their desire to support a worthy cause. Our intent has never changed, and we continue to honor our pledge to support the patients, families and staff members of the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics.\u201d\n\nMany on social media were more forgiving, however, with King supporters slamming the Register and Anheuser-Busch for holding the 24-year-old accountable for these posts, and potentially depleting how much money the children\u2019s hospital will receive. So #standwithCarson was trending early Wednesday, especially after it was revealed that the Register reporter who wrote the King profile also has racist and inappropriate tweets in his online history, which included him repeatedly using the N-word.\n\n*We\u2019re all flawed.\n\n*We\u2019ve all done and said regrettable things.\n\n*We\u2019ve all matured since the age of 16. @CarsonKing2 did something universally good and selfless.\n\n\n\nWe haven\u2019t all done that.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m 100% #standwithCarson\n\n\n\nShame on @DMRegister and @BuschBeer \u2014 BeerlessHeaven (@BeerlessHeaven) September 25, 2019\n\nThe Register responded that it was investigating the reporter, Aaron Calvin, and backpedaled from being responsible for Busch severing its ties with King. A statement from the editor notes that King gave his mea culpa press conference before the Register story was even published.\n\nA statement from our editor: pic.twitter.com/ZH9AhcrYbg \u2014 Des Moines Register (@DMRegister) September 25, 2019\n\nBut on Thursday night, the paper reported that it Calvin was \u201cno longer with the paper,\u201d and it is \u201crevising its policies and practices\u201d with employment, including those it says failed to uncover its own reporter\u2019s questionable posts.\n\nKing himself tweeted support for the newspaper on Tuesday night, writing that it \u201chas been nothing but kind in all of their coverage,\u201d and that, \u201cI appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me.\u201d", "description": "The brewer will still match donations for the University of Iowa children\u2019s hospital, which have passed $1 million.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS037_busch__ZG_20190925103648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
