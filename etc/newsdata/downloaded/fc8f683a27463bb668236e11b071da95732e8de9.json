Biden with a new $10 million television and digital ad accusing him of corrupt dealings with Ukraine while in office.\n\nThe ad, entitled \u201cBiden Corruption,\u201d will start airing on national cable outlets and digital platforms on Sunday and will run for a week. It is funded with $8 million from the Trump campaign and $2 million from the Republican National Committee.\n\nIt also comes on the heels of House Democrats announcing a formal impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump for his own actions involving Ukraine.\n\n\u201cDemocrats want to deny Americans the opportunity to vote to re-elect President Trump and people need to know the facts,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \u201cThis is a Joe Biden scandal and the Democrats are trying to use it to steal the election.\u201d\n\nThe campaign ad highlights Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts as vice president in 2016 to have Ukraine fire its top prosecutor, whose office was investigating a natural gas company that paid Hunter Biden $3 million.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d a narrator says in the ad. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.\u201d\n\nThe ad says Democrats are using impeachment to invalidate the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThey lost the election. Now, they want to steal this one. Don\u2019t let them,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nHouse Democrats moved to impeach Mr. Trump this week after a transcript of a July 25 phone call showed that he asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the Bidens. Democrats say Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine in a quid pro quo, a charge which the president denies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
