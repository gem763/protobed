But here are some winners and losers, as I saw them.\n\nWinners\n\nJoe Biden: He\u2019s old, but he looked energetic and spoke clearly. He made a few errors \u2014 who\u2019s \u201cclipping coupons\u201d in \u201cthe stock market?\u201d But in general, he was forceful and seemed knowledgeable. In particular, he nailed Sen. Elizabeth Warren on how her health care plan would increase taxes on the middle class. And he was surprisingly sensible in dismissing \u201ccourt-packing\u201d schemes. His final remarks were a bit over the top, but after three hours I\u2019d probably have been raving, too.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard: When she challenged her colleagues who wanted to \u201cend endless wars\u201d but who were also criticizing President Trump from withdrawing troops from Syria, she didn\u2019t back down, and blasted the New York Times and a CNN contributor for calling her a \u201cRussian asset\u201d for criticizing what she called the \u201cregime change war\u201d in Syria. She then challenged Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says we shouldn\u2019t have troops in the Middle East at all, on the issue. On this and other issues, she was firm, clear, and was willing to buck the herd. And in her closing remarks, quoting Lincoln, she said \u201cI don\u2019t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg: He made mincemeat of Beto O\u2019Rourke, who dodged a question from Anderson Cooper on how he would enforce a ban on assault weapons. Beto was left looking flustered and trying to claim that Mayor Pete was insensitive to victims of violence, which was a bad look for him.\n\nBernie Sanders: A guy who can have a heart attack and come back a few weeks later, yelling louder than anyone else for three hours, is winning. He was asked about his health, and he answered loudly, and then charmingly thanked his post-attack well-wishers. And he scored on Biden with his remarks about bipartisan support for the Iraq war.\n\nIn Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15, 2019. More\n\nLosers\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke: Numerous fellow candidates criticized him for his \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15s\u201d remarks. Between that and the drubbing that Mayor Pete administered, he had a very bad night.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren: Overall, her manner was noticeably stiffer and and less comfortable than the other candidates, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, despite having a bad night, landed a telling shot when he accused her of \u201cbeing punitive,\u201d and pitting one part of America against another. It was a fair charge, and it hurt; she looked flustered as she limply said she didn\u2019t think she was punitive. Also, as several of her colleagues pointed out, she repeatedly dodged questions about whether she would increase taxes on the middle class. She also dodged Kamala Harris\u2019s question about Trump and Twitter. And her delivery reminds me more and more of Hillary, which seems unpromising.\n\nJulian Castro: Several times I forgot he was even on the stage for 30 minutes or more.\n\nTom Steyer: Everyone on the stage was hating on billionaires, and he was the only billionaire on stage. Plus, when he said the average American hasn\u2019t had a raise in 40 years, he was totally wrong.\n\nVladimir Putin: I don\u2019t think this many Democrats have stood on a stage and promised to stand against Russian infiltration in my lifetime. Seriously, it\u2019s a huge pivot from when Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney in 2012 for calling Russia our greatest geopolitical foe.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nAndrew Yang: He responded to Bernie Sanders\u2019 federal jobs program by noting that \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government.\u201d True!\n\nFinal observation: The crowd was surprisingly quiet, but all the biggest applause lines related to abortion.", "description": "Vladimir Putin was among the surprise losers of the latest Democratic debate.
