We saw a team playing fast, fluid football with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants.\n\n'Ole has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years. He is building a squad that respects the club\u2019s history, in which players work hard and respect their team-mates. No-one is bigger than the club.'\n\nWoodward has also defended his record as Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman and insisted that making money will never come before success on the pitch.\n\nThe team have been in decline since Woodward replaced David Gill in 2013 despite spending close to \u00a31billion on new players.\n\nUnited have not won the Premier League title since Sir Alex Ferguson departed the same year and currently lie in 12th place after their worst start in 30 years under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nWoodward\u2019s role has come under increasing scrutiny as the delay over appointing a director of football continues.\n\nThe 47-year-old has also faced criticism over the plethora of commercial deals worldwide on his watch that have boosted United\u2019s revenue in stark contrast to the team\u2019s dwindling success.\n\nWoodward admitted that Louis van Gaal (right) signed stars such as Angel Di Maria (left), who didn't fit the mould of a Manchester United player\n\nHowever, Woodward said: \u2018What\u2019s important is that the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side. There is a myth we have non-football people making football decisions, and I think it\u2019s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club.\n\n\u2018The reality of Manchester United is we are a club in two parts. First of all, we are an incredible 141-year footballing institution with all that history, all that legacy, all that tradition and that tradition of success. That can never, ever change. We need to keep that protected.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s understood Woodward feels much of the criticism is unfair and it has also hurt his family. His wife, Isabelle, is said to have stopped reading media articles about him.\n\nBut the United chief accepts that mistakes have been made during his six years at the helm, not least in the recruitment process.\n\nHe accepts it was unfair to expect David Moyes to inherit a unique scouting structure set up over many years by Ferguson. While Ferguson relied on a network that included his brother, Martin, and just 12 full-time scouts, Moyes was used to a different set-up and should have been allowed to get on with his first-team duties while the job of recruitment was shared among other staff.\n\nWoodward has come in for plenty of criticism but insists the rebuilding process is a slow one\n\nLouis van Gaal was hired with one eye on his ability to identify new signings but in hindsight the club realised some of them did not fit the mould of a Manchester United player. United now have as many as 60 scouts and a huge database that means more than 800 right backs were scrutinised before they bought Aaron Wan-Bissaka for \u00a350million in June.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this now runs in an efficient and productive way,\u2019 said Woodward, who again pointed out that he only has a limited say in the process.\n\n\u2018Player recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and by the first-team manager and his staff, not by senior management.\u2019\n\nHaving delivered Solskjaer\u2019s three top targets by also signing Harry Maguire and Daniel James in the summer, United hope to bring in up to five more before the start of next season.\n\nThere is a possibility of a new arrival in January if the deal is right, but a bid for Mario Mandzukic of Juventus seems unlikely as United try to fill a yawning gap up front. They have faced criticism for letting Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez leave without signing a replacement striker.\n\nUnited broke the transfer record for a defender when they brought in Harry Maguire\n\nUnited are 12th in the Premier League and take on fierce rivals Liverpool this weekend\n\nHowever, it\u2019s said that Woodward and Solskjaer knew it could leave the forward line thin on the ground, but they thought it was the right decision to move the club forward in the long run. They did not foresee an injury to Anthony Martial that has kept the Frenchman out since August and further depleted the attack, nor the raft of other injuries sidelining half the team that beat Chelsea 4-0 on the opening weekend.\n\nWoodward is said to view United\u2019s current position in the table as false and is optimistic it will improve over time. Sources close to the United chief say he is happy with the mood around the club. There is certainly no appetite to make Solskjaer the fourth managerial casualty since Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nUnited understand the Norwegian has been asked to oversee a rebuilding job and produce a better, younger team. They are determined to give him time despite the stuttering form that has carried on from the end of last season into the start of this one.\n\n\u2018Cultural reset\u2019 has been the buzz phrase around the club under Solskjaer, and Woodward understands that United are making a fresh start.\n\n\u2018The changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it\u2019s also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.\u2019", "description": "Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has backed manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer going into Sunday's clash with Liverpool as they sit just two points above the relegation zone.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19852822-0-image-a-19_1571343829829.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
