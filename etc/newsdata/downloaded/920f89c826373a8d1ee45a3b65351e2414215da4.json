South Korean military intelligence believes the weapon was a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).\n\nThe missile reached a peak altitude of over 550 miles before coming down in the waters of Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo swiftly condemned the launch, describing it as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Trump administration officials said they were monitoring the situation and coordinating with regional allies to analyze data about the launch, which took place only a few hours after North Korean officials announced new talks would be held with the U.S. on Saturday.\n\nAs military experts pointed out, a medium-range ballistic missile launched from a submarine is theoretically a threat to the United States, depending on how close the sub could get to North America before opening fire. At a minimum, North Korean SLBMs pose a clear threat to American interests in the Pacific and Hawaii.\n\nThe South Koreans naturally interpreted the launch as a message aimed at them, perhaps as a rebuke for Monday\u2019s passage of a resolution condemning Pyongyang\u2019s previous ten missile tests as a violation of the peace agreement between North and South Korea, or a peevish response to South Korea\u2019s observance of Armed Forces Day on Tuesday, which included the public debut of new F-35 fighters obtained from the United States.\n\n\u201cThe root cause of the stalemate in the North-South relations lies, in short, in the South Korean authorities\u2019 treacherous behavior,\u201d North Korea\u2019s state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper said on Wednesday in an editorial denouncing the South\u2019s military cooperation with America as \u201cunchangingly aggressive.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s National Security Council expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the test and warned it will raise tensions on the Korean Peninsula. If the missile was launched from a submarine, it would be North Korea\u2019s first SLBM test in three years.\n\nSatellite photos of North Korea\u2019s submarine base at Sinpo suggest a sub was launched from there at some point after dictator Kim Jong-un paid a highly publicized visit to the base on July 23. North Korea tends to test new weapons quickly after Kim performs such an inspection.\n\nThe administration of dovish South Korean President Moon Jae-in notably declined to immediately denounce the launch as Japan did, saying it preferred to let the U.N. Security Council decide if the missile test was an actionable violation of its resolutions.\n\n\u201cGiven the timing of the launch, the North appears to have wanted to strengthen its negotiation position ahead of the talks and ramp up pressure on the U.S. to come up with a new calculation method acceptable to Pyongyang,\u201d Handong Global University professor Park Won-gon told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News on Wednesday.\n\nYonhap reported analysis of the missile launch is still underway, including efforts to determine if two missiles were launched, or a single vehicle split into two segments during flight.", "description": "North Korea conducts another provocative missile launch, this time what appears to be its first submarine-launched missile test in 3 years.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/08/5444d9_north-korea-is-crippling-sanctions-imposed-carrying-out-nuclear-ballistic-e1541807490713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
