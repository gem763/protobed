Mixed-race marriages are growing at rapid rates, according to a TIME analysis of Census data. The above interactive chart shows marriage rates for any combination of race or ethnicity and gender of each spouse.\n\nWhile the number of white men wedding white women has dropped almost 7 percent since 2000, marriages between white men and non-white women\u2013either Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, or Multiracial\u2013is up 36 percent. (The reverse\u2013White women and non-White men\u2013is up 33 percent.)\n\nIn some cases, the disparity between genders is more pronounced. In 2013, there were over 130,000 marriages between White men and Black women, while there were nearly 320,000 marriages between White women and Black men. Both combinations are trending heavily upward.\n\nSource: IPUMS-USA, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wedding-rings1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color"}
