I don\u2019t see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In fact, at times it actually looks worse. I think Sheffield United played better football in the first half than Arsenal and I don\u2019t think you would have seen that under Wenger.\u2019\n\nCertain statistics to have emerged in the aftermath of Sheffield United\u2019s win seem to back up Carragher\u2019s assertions\u2026\n\nWretched away form\n\nArsenal\u2019s unconvincing away form has been a major issue for a while and their travel sickness was the main reason for last season\u2019s top-four failure. Despite having the third-best home record in the Premier League, seven teams bettered Arsenal\u2019s away efforts in 2018-19.\n\nThe Gunners claimed 20 more points at the Emirates than they did elsewhere last season and a similar pattern is already emerging this campaign. Arsenal have won three and drawn one of their four homes games, but won only one of their five away matches.\n\nLast 10 away games in the Premier League under Emery: LWLLW (18-19)\n\nWLDDL (19-20) 11 points from 30. \u2014 arseblog (@arseblog) October 21, 2019\n\nIncluding the final five games of last season, Arsenal have been beaten in half of their last ten away matches, taking 11 points from a possible 30.\n\nShould such form continue the club\u2019s long-awaited return to the Champions League may be prolonged further.\n\nDwindling goal threat\n\nAlthough David Luiz\u2019s recent winner against Bournemouth proved to be the exception to the rule, generally speaking Arsenal only tend to win in the Premier League this season if Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been on the scoresheet.\n\nAubameyang has scored seven of Arsenal\u2019s 13 league goals this season, accounting for 54 per cent of their overall total. Only Norwich City are more reliant on their leading marksman with Teemu Pukki\u2019s six goals making up 60 per cent of their ten.\n\nArsenal are struggling for goals particularly when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Pictured) isn\u2019t on the scoresheet (Picture: Getty)\n\nArsenal\u2019s over-reliance on Aubameyang is a major issue considering their lack of goals from elsewhere. At this stage last season, Arsenal had scored 22 times \u2013 nine more than their current tally \u2013 with ten different scorers compared to only six this term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, Arsenal\u2019s glaring weakness has been at the back, but at present even their attack isn\u2019t functioning particularly effectively.\n\nSet-piece vulnerability\n\nSheffield United have stuck two fingers up at a number of lazy pundits who reduced their style of football to that of the hit-and-hope variety with Wilder\u2019s side popping the ball about nicely in midfield and creating a decent number of chances.\n\nHowever, it is very on-brand of Arsenal to lose to a battling team expected to be in the lower reaches of the table this season via a set-piece goal with Mousset seizing upon a Jack O\u2019Connell knockdown to scramble in a first-half winner.\n\n22 \u2013 Arsenal have conceded 22 Premier League goals from set-pieces since the start of last season; only Watford (25) and Everton (24) have conceded more. Weakness. pic.twitter.com/5k0jVkbUZJ \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 21, 2019\n\nMousset\u2019s strike condemned Arsenal to their 22nd conceded goal from a set-piece since the start of last season, a total only worsened by Watford (25) who have one clean sheet since February and Everton (24) whose zonal-marking led shortcomings under Marco Silva have been well-documented.\n\nArsenal used to routinely struggle against the Bolton\u2019s and Stoke\u2019s of this world and as of yet, Emery has been unable to rectify what has been a prevailing problem for a number of seasons.\n\nSurprising shot statistics\n\nA criticism levelled at Emery and his team recently is that Arsenal rarely seem to be in control of a match, with their opponents routinely enjoying promising spells of pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat his highlighted by the fact that Arsenal have conceded on average 16 shots per game \u2013 a total that only two of the three promoted clubs (Aston Villa and Norwich City) can beat.\n\nBernd Leno has been kept extremely busy since his arrival at Arsenal from Bayer Leverkusen last summer (Picture: Getty)\n\nIn contrast, Arsenal have fired off just 13 attempts per game which has them eighth in the division behind the likes of Villa, Southampton, Everton and winless Watford. Arsenal aren\u2019t shooting enough and are letting their opponents have far too many.\n\nThis is hardly a new phenomenon, though, as since Emery was appointed, Arsenal have conceded 13.7 shots per game and attempted 12.4. That a top-six side frequently has fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents is pretty concerning.\n\nClean sheet woes\n\nWhen Emery took charge of Arsenal, they were already vulnerable at the back and while that is worth remembering, he has clearly been unable to instigate much, if any improvement in their defensive performances.\n\nArsenal have kept as many clean sheets away from home in the Premier League (2) as Sheffield United since Unai Emery replaced Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Sheffield United have played four games. \ud83d\ude43 pic.twitter.com/KKeKnQckMF \u2014 Squawka Football (@Squawka) October 21, 2019\n\nA rather damning stat that demonstrates this, is that Arsenal have as many clean sheets away from home (two) as Sheffield United do in 19 more matches. If Wilder can, with all due respect to Sheffield United\u2019s players, make an inferior team difficult to score against, then why can\u2019t Emery with Arsenal\u2019s squad?\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Arsenal could have moved back to within a point of Manchester City in the Premier League table with a win against Sheffield United on Monday night.
