While there are treatments currently available for the wet form, there is no authorized treatment yet for D-AMD.Luxa Biotechnology, owned 50:50 by Yuyang DNU and NSCI - the first non-profit stem cell research institute in the United States, established in 2007 - wants to develop the first treatment for the dry form based on stem cells.Unlike other stem cell-based therapy candidates for D-AMD, the new venture\u2019s therapy uses stem cells derived from RPE itself and stimulates regeneration of those cells. According to market tracker GlobalData, the global market for D-AMD treatment is expected to grow from $6.2 billion in 2017 to $9.3 billion by 2021 as the number of older people increases worldwide.\u201cIt was proven from trials on rats that our RPE stem cell treatment made significant improvements in vision and sustainability of the effect,\u201d said Sally Temple, head of research and development (R&D) at the new venture. \u201cUsing RPE stem cells is also safer for being less tumorigenic than other stem cell treatment candidates for D-AMD being developed at this point.\u201dYuyang DNU, which made its entry into the biotech sector in 2018, has been working to develop therapies that address unmet medical needs.The company, which started in 1976 as a TV parts manufacturer, established its first biotech joint venture in the United States last year, Lenus Therapeutics, which is owned 50:50 with GtreeBNT.Including the D-AMD treatment, Yuyang DNU has four drugs in its pipeline, with RGN-137, an experimental therapy for wound healing for epidermolysis bullosa patients, awaiting Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States.BY KO JUN-TAE [ko.juntae@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
