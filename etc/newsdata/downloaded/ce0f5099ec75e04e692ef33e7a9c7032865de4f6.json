(NOAA/NHC)\n\nAs far as tropical storms go, Karen has seen better days.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center downgraded Karen to a tropical depression on Friday. There are no planned coastal watches or warnings. Wind gusts were last recorded floating about 35 miles per hour. As of 5 p.m. Friday, Karen completely fell apart, leaving only remnants of the storm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been there, Karen,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\nThis year, the National Hurricane Center has Karen as the \u201cK\u201d in its naming list of tropical storms from the Atlantic. It just also happens to be a name known all too well on certain corners of the Internet. You could call it a perfect storm.\n\nKaren is now becoming a meme. Or, well, Karen is a meme. The name \u201cKaren\u201d is used on the Internet to describe the sort of woman who firmly asks to see your manager.\n\nEarlier in the week, the tropical storm struck Puerto Rico with flooding rains and winds before trekking northward. Capital Weather Gang\u2019s Matthew Cappucci called the system a \u201ccapricious\u201d storm, stopping and starting throughout the week.\n\n\u201cTrying to forecast Karen\u2019s path is kind of like predicting a Roomba vacuum cleaner,\u201d Cappucci said in a review of the forecast on Wednesday.\n\n[Hurricane Lorenzo packs Category 4 winds \u2014 and presents an ominous climate signal]\n\nKaren will not be speaking to the manager. https://t.co/KTJ5k7pzHT \u2014 Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) September 27, 2019\n\nNow that the storm is crawling to a standstill, people jumped at the chance to rib the storm\u2019s downfall.\n\nKaren, in many ways, is a placeholder for the impatient customer at work or the harsh and misguided reviewer on Yelp. You\u2019ll find her name in the comments with a curt, \u201cThanks, Karen,\u201d or \u201cWe know, Karen.\u201d There\u2019s an entire community on Reddit with more than 275,000 members sharing posts dedicated to the \u201cKarens\u201d in life. One recent post is simply titled: \u201cTHE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when \u201cKaren\u201d entered the Internet lexicon. There\u2019s often mention of Karen Smith, a character in \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the moment in the school cafeteria when Gretchen Weiners chastises Smith across the lunch table, telling her: \u201cOh, my God, Karen. You can\u2019t just ask people if they\u2019re white.\u201d\n\nYears later, the first name now personifies an entire character. Internet lore casts Karen as a suburban mom with anywhere from two to four kids. She\u2019s entitled and she may have a shorter haircut with blonde highlights.\n\nBut what Karen means depends on who you ask. When Nintendo released its first look at the Nintendo Switch in 2016, the Internet (specifically, Tumblr) created \u201cNintendo Switch Karen.\u201d The \u201cKaren,\u201d in the commercial, brought her new console to a rooftop hangout with friends, forcing everyone to play video games instead of enjoying their bohemian outdoor patio.\n\n\u201cKaren\u201d is even on Tik Tok, the short-video app, telling teens they can\u2019t leave the house until they change out of their Frosty the Snowman costume.\n\nThe joke always ends with the same line: \u201cRespect the drip, Karen.\u201d\n\nTo some, Karen really just represents an end to a week of torrential downpour. Forecasters are instead watching Hurricane Lorenzo, which the National Hurricane Center has already called \u201cone of the largest and most powerful hurricanes of record for the tropical central Atlantic.\u201d As words like \u201cwhistleblower complaint\u201d and \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d flood our collective timelines, Karen offered a welcome note of levity heading into the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe are all Karen,\u201d wrote one person on Twitter.\n\nI get it, Karen. I get it. https://t.co/Bz8wppyyuT \u2014 Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) September 27, 2019", "description": "Spoiler: It's because of a meme.", "authors": ["Teddy Amenabar", "Audience Editor Embedded On The Local Desk", "September At Pm", "Teddy Amenabar Is An Editor For The Audience Engagement Team In The Newsroom", "Embedded On The Local Desk.
