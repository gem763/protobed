REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate\u2019s antitrust panel will meet later this month to discuss concerns that tech giants, such as Google or Amazon, seek to buy smaller rivals in order to head off competition.\n\nSenators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chairman and top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel, said the hearing was scheduled for Sept. 24 but did not list witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe Subcommittee also is interested in soliciting input from policy analysts, market participants, and other stakeholders on whether legislative action relating to such mergers is needed to ensure digital markets remain competitive,\u201d Lee said in a statement.\n\nKlobuchar said in the statement that the companies\u2019 acquisitions \u201chave raised serious competition issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world. They face little competition and there are numerous examples of the companies purchasing start-up competitors in various lines of business,\u201d she said.\n\nThe tech giants, among the most rich and powerful companies in the world, are facing increasingly intense antitrust scrutiny.\n\nThe Justice Department said in July that it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms, focusing on whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The investigation is believed to be aimed at Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O), and potentially Apple Inc (AAPL.O).\n\nSeparately, the Federal Trade Commission is also probing Amazon and Facebook to determine if they abused their massive market power.", "description": "The Senate's antitrust panel will meet later this month to discuss concerns that tech giants, such as Google or Amazon, seek to buy smaller rivals in order to head off competition.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425902923&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8221V"}
