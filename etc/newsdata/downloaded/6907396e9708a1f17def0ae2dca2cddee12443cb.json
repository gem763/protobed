But the Olympics will be the pinnacle of the sport for other athletes debuting their specialties in Tokyo 2020.\n\n\u201cI was surprised [when skateboarding was added],\u201d said Lizzie Armanto, one of the top women\u2019s skateboarders in the world. \u201cThere was talk about it being included. and then once it was official, everyone seemed to wonder, now what?\n\n\u201cFrom the people in charge to the skaters to the brands, everyone seems like they\u2019re still trying to figure it out,\u201d said Armanto, who hails from Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nThe 2020 Summer Games will begin July 24 in Tokyo, with skateboarding focused on park and street events. Other extreme sports \u2014 sport climbing, surfing and karate \u2014 also will debut in Japan.\n\nArmanto, 26, a dual-citizen of the United States and Finland, will complete for Finland at the Olympics. She is known as the most groundbreaking skateboarder in history after she became the first woman to complete Hawk\u2019s 360-degree vertical loop, a gravity-defying ramp named after legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s natural to be hesitant about taking a new step,\u201d Armanto said. \u201cSkateboarders are precious about their culture. For skateboarding to be included, I think it\u2019s going to make more opportunities for skaters.\n\n\u201cSkateboarding is my passion and has changed my perspective on how I look at the world. It\u2019s cool to be able to share that.\u201d\n\nHawk says it\u2019s \u201cabout time\u201d the sport has been added to the Summer Games, but is concerned that including it could inspire athletes to skate for only fame or fortune.\n\n\u201cSkateboarding has come far enough that I feel like the Olympics needs skateboarding\u2019s cool factor more than we need their validation,\u201d Hawk said at the Project Play Summit.\n\nArmanto chose to skate for Finland to open up spots for more top athletes to compete since no country can send more than three athletes to Tokyo per event per gender.\n\nBy choosing for Finland, Armanto opens an opportunity another top women\u2019s skateboarder to compete for the United States. Close to half of the world\u2019s top 20 skateboarders will not be at the Summer Games because of team size limitations.\n\nSome skateboarders don\u2019t see the Olympics majorly impacting their sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be another contest,\u201d said men\u2019s skateboarder Curren Caples, of Ventura, Calif. \u201cIn a lot of people\u2019s eyes it might be taken more seriously, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change too much. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed snowboarding too much.\u201d\n\nCaples, 23, said he isn\u2019t sure if skateboarding\u2019s inclusion in the Olympics will make the sport \u201cthat much bigger.\u201d He compared the possible impact to snowboarding, which was introduced to the Olympics in 1998. Caples also said he thinks the Olympics will help the sport be seen by a different audience.\n\nHe thinks the sports inclusion could make contest skateboarding harder, with athletes training strictly for contests and working on harder tricks.\n\nThe Vans Park Series World Championships \u2014 the top park terrain skateboarding event \u2014 is being used as a blueprint by the International Olympic Committee for Tokyo 2020.\n\nVans \u2014 the organizing body of competitive skateboarding \u2014 created the format for competitive park terrain skating and will continue to run the league and support all of its athletes at the 2020 Olympics. It will continue to produce its competition series independently of the Summer Games.\n\nVans awards equal prize money for men and women. Sweden\u2019s Oskar Rozenberg Hallberg won the men\u2019s final and Japan\u2019s Sakura Yosozumi won the women\u2019s final at the VPS World Championships. Armanto finished seventh. There were five countries represented in the finals.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the Olympics needs skateboarding more than skateboarding needs the Olympics,\u201d said Bobby Gascon, the head of action sports at Vans.\n\nGascon said skateboarding and the Olympics aren\u2019t an \u201ceasy marriage\u201d and there is a \u201cdivide in skateboard culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s super curious about how people are going to show up [at the Olympics], what they\u2019re going to be wearing,\u201d Caples said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s unclear. In my eyes, it\u2019s just going to be another contest.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 Skateboarding icon Tony Hawk says the Olympics needs the sport\u2019s \u201ccool factor\u201d more than the sport needs the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
