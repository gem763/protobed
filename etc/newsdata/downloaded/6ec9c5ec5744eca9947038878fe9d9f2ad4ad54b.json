And with the legendary American coach now banned for four years for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d, UKA now looks desperately short of chips.\n\nMo Farah's former coach Alberto Salazar gets four-year ban for doping violations Read more\n\nAfter all, it was not a good look that your performance director Neil Black \u2013 who once hailed Salazar as a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cone of the best people to work with that I have ever come across\u201d \u2013 continued to give the American the benefit of the doubt for several years despite damaging accusations made by Panorama programme Catch Me If You Can?\n\nAnd it did not exactly inspire confidence when UKA\u2019s own performance oversight management, set up to investigate the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with its star athlete Mo Farah, found \u201cno reason for concern\u201d \u2013 despite speaking to several whistleblowers.\n\nYou wonder what the investigators, led by former sprinter Jason Gardener and marathon runner Sarah Rowell, were asking. When I spoke to Allan Kupczak, a former massage therapist at the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, he told me Salazar always carried testosterone with him. As he put it: \u201cAlberto would say: \u2018Don\u2019t let anyone touch my bag \u2013 I have my testosterone cream in there. I don\u2019t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.\u2019 My thought was why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete?\u201d\n\nThat raised a red flag for me. Others I spoke to had similar stories. No wonder Steve Magness, the BBC\u2019s main whistleblower, was dismissive about UKA\u2019s enquiry and said that he had only a 30-45 minute interview with their panel.\n\nSo why did UKA not establish more distance from Salazar in 2015? According to one senior insider, the organisation should have done more, but some figures were either too close to Salazar, or did not appreciate the scale of the revelations. \u201cWhere were UK Sport in all this?\u201d the source added. \u201cThey weren\u2019t putting any pressure on UKA to get rid of Salazar at any time up to Rio.\u201d\n\nHowever, the biggest factor was Farah himself. The simple fact is he did not want to leave the man who had transformed him from a decent distance runner, who finished seventh in the 5,000m at the 2009 world championships, into an unstoppable title-winning machine between 2011 and 2017.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mo Farah wins 5,000m gold at London in 2012. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nThat clearly left UK Athletics in a bind. After the BBC Panorama programme aired in June 2015, Farah promised UKA he was going to ditch Salazar. But at some point on a flight from Portland to the UK, he had dramatically changed his mind.\n\nAfter that, few in UKA wanted to go against its double Olympic champion \u2013 because they needed his medals \u2013 or be too critical of Nike given its massive kit sponsorship of the organisation. Only UKA\u2019s chairman, Ed Warner, who suggested Farah should suspend his relationship with Salazar, sounded a note of caution. Otherwise everyone stuck to the line: the American was innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAnd of course he was. However, there was surely a middle way that would have meant establishing distance from Salazar without condemning him. After all, much of what is in the American Arbitration Association report, which found that Salazar had been \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d while head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, was known in 2015 \u2013 including that Salazar infused his athletes with more than the permitted levels of L-carnitine, and got another, Amy Begley, to unwittingly transport an envelope with testosterone cream on it, which he later used in a bizarre experiment on his sons.\n\nIncidentally, the report contains several fresh testimonies that certainly raise some eyebrows. The American former athlete Danny Mackey says that while he was working at the Nike lab he was told by one of the doctors, Loren Myhre, to take thyroid and testosterone therapy. Mackey testifies that Dr Myhre told him: \u201cThis is what Salazar\u2019s athletes do, and they haven\u2019t gotten caught. You\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Salazar has always denied any wrongdoing with his athletes.\n\nThe report also contains Salazar\u2019s emails to Nike\u2019s chief executive, Mark Parker, in which the coach discusses experimenting with a banned testosterone product called Androgel, which can boost performance, on his own sons. In one of his emails, Salazar indicates that using a small amount does not reach the level that would \u201ctrigger great concern\u201d about failing a test. To which Parker responds: \u201cIt will be interesting to determine the minimal amount required to create a positive test.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Six key figures in Salazar saga: Where does the judgment leave them? Show Hide Alberto Salazar The legendary coach is flying home from Doha after his ban. Has vowed to clear his name, saying he has \u201cendured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada\u201d. Neil Black The British Athletics performance director is already under pressure for disappointing performances on the track and many in the sport are now questioning his judgment and loyalty to Salazar. Will come under pressure to step down. Mo Farah About to run in the Chicago marathon and in a statement brushed off close ties with Salazar from 2010 to 2017. \u201cI left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017 but as I\u2019ve always said, I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line.\u201d Jeffrey Brown The Texas endocrinologist who treated many of Salazar\u2019s athletes was also banned for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct.\u201d Yet to comment on Usada\u2019s decision. Nike The sportswear giant has said it will back Salazar\u2019s appeal against his four-year ban. Also insists that Usada\u2019s decision had \u201cnothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d. Questions about its CEO Mark Parker discussing testosterone with Salazar remain. Sebastian Coe IAAF president has always stood by Salazar, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t run away with the idea that this is a hole-in-the-wall, circa 1970s Eastern Bloc operation. It\u2019s not.\u201d However moved quickly to ensure that his old friend\u2019s credentials were deactivated on Tuesday.\n\nThe panel accepted Salazar\u2019s explanation that he was experimenting with testosterone on his sons because he was paranoid that someone might try to spike one of his athletes. However, it added: \u201cWhile the panel accepts [the] Respondent\u2019s contention that the experiment was designed to protect athletes of the NOP, it could have also been conducted as part of a nefarious attempt to \u2018beat\u2019 the testing system and thus is susceptible to creating an appearance of cheating that one could argue would bring the experiment much closer to being \u2018in connection with\u2019 an athlete, competition or training.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Farah cheated. But sometimes you judge people by the company they keep. And his record of being coached by Salazar, plus his friendship with Jama Aden, who is being investigated by Spanish Anti\u2011Doping, are two strikes against him. Farah denies continuing any relationship with Aden since 2015 when the coach acted as an \u201cunofficial facilitator\u201d to UKA.\n\nRussia at risk of Tokyo Olympics ban over \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Moscow lab data Read more\n\nIt is worth remembering, too, that at a press conference in 2015 Farah promised he would speak to whistleblowers. \u201cDefinitely, for my sake,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know the answers. Because at the end of the day it\u2019s my reputation. Because the headline is not Alberto. It\u2019s Mo\u2019s coach. And it\u2019s not fair on kids, my family, people who come out and watch me. At the Olympics 75,000 people were cheering for me, and I think them 75,000 people should know what\u2019s going on. I should at least be honest with them.\u201d\n\nThe passion in his words suggested he was serious. Sadly for him, and UKA, he does not appear to have acted on them.", "description": "There is no evidence that Mo Farah cheated \u2013 but sometimes people are judged by the company they keep", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c23091751967186d5d8bb0310d3774a3108e51e/0_326_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4f6e51549ab4f0ea7e73cea7f5e9249e", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
