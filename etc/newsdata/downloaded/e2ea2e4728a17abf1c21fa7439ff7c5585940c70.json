China Mengniu Offers 59% Premium for Baby-Formula Maker Bellamy's\n\n(Bloomberg) -- China Mengniu Dairy Co. agreed to buy Bellamy\u2019s Australia Ltd. for A$1.5 billion ($1 billion), offering a 59% premium for the infant formula-maker as it seeks to soak up supplies for the Chinese consumer.\n\nThe Hong Kong-listed firm, which markets and distributes dairy products in China, offered A$13.25 per share for Bellamy\u2019s, compared with Friday\u2019s closing price of A$8.32, according to a statement Monday. Bellamy\u2019s board unanimously recommended the offer.\n\nThe target\u2019s stock surged as much as 56% in early Sydney trading to A$12.97.\n\nMengniu\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Lu Minfang said Bellamy\u2019s Australian operations and supply chain were critical to his company. \u201cOur sales growth ambitions for Bellamy\u2019s in Australia, and the broader Asia-Pacific region, will see investment in the local dairy industry,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nThe deal, which is subject to approval from Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board, would hand Mengniu one of Australia\u2019s leading producers of organic baby food and formula. Shares in the Launceston, Tasmania-based company have fallen from a March 2018 peak of A$22.52, amid increased competition and delays in approval for a license from China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation to sell organic formula in the nation.\n\nThe delay hurt the company\u2019s full-year profit, which declined 36% to A$30.1 million, and Bellamy\u2019s pushed its medium-term target of A$500 million annual revenue beyond fiscal 2021.\n\n\u201cMengniu is a preeminent dairy company in China and an ideal partner for our business,\u201d Bellamy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Andrew Cohen said in the statement. \u201cIt offers a strong platform for distribution and success in China, and a foundation for growth in the organic dairy and food industry in Australia.\u201d\n\n(Updates with share reaction in third paragraph.)", "description": "China Mengniu Offers 59% Premium for Baby-Formula Maker Bellamy's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6703X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
