A group of African Americans lined up outside, waiting for emergency relief from a government station. Bourke-White, who showed how strenuous the depression was in the 1930s, is featured in a new group exhibit that details how America coped in dire political and economic times.\n\nA Vision Shared: the photographers who captured the Great Depression Read more\n\nOpening 21 September at the Art Institute of Chicago, Photography + Folk Art: Looking for America in the 1930s features more than 130 artworks and artefacts that look at the country during the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cBourke-White was a master of the impact photo,\u201d said Elizabeth Siegel, who co-curated the exhibit alongside Elizabeth McGoey. \u201cYou have this image of a white family in a car and its up against a line of African Americans waiting for government relief. She set the stage for what the depression looked like and its ironies.\u201d\n\nWith fears of a looming recession, it\u2019s an apt time to look back at the past for our potential penny-pinching future. How did Americans deal with the depression? These stories from the past act as a sort of guide, from sluggish sales to job cuts and downright skimping and scraping.\n\n\u201cThis work is from almost 100 years ago, but there\u2019s relevant lessons for today,\u201d said Siegel. \u201cWe hope visitors will come to this show and understand the historical moment and how to reflect on it today.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Girl at Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama (Artelia Bendolph), by Arthur Rothstein, April 1937 Photograph: The Art Institute of Chicago\n\nIn the five-room exhibit, the photos by Walker Evans show the spartan homes of coal miners in West Virginia, which had beds, tables and not much else. Photographer Dorothea Lange details the painful poverty and starvation many experienced, as she captured impoverished Americans waiting for food in a time when there wasn\u2019t much to go around.\n\nThere are also photos by Russell Lee, who shot the simple farm life, and Arthur Rothstein, who photographed schoolchildren in a rural school in Alabama who had access to a blackboard (and not much else).\n\nWith today\u2019s excessive consumerism, it\u2019s a chilling journey. These vintage photos, too, are shown alongside folk art, some of which includes furniture, hand-stitched wool rugs, jugs made of maple wood, armchairs carved from ash and a 1920s quilt made of cotton.\n\n\u201cDuring times of upheaval, there\u2019s an interest in locating our natural traditions,\u201d said McGoey. \u201cFolk art represented a shared communal past and artistic tradition that had yet to be celebrated in the hierarchical spheres in the art canon. Photography and folk art were barking at the door of high art, for sure. This is a story of how the canon expands to absorb the margins.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also art showing how people enjoyed their lives without the glut of unnecessary spending, like Berenice Abbott\u2019s photos of small business owners and smiling Americans as they peruse the streets of Pennsylvania. They\u2019re accompanied by audio clips of folk songs such as Skip James\u2019s Hard Time Killin\u2019 Floor Blues and the Boswell Sisters\u2019 Shine on Harvest Moon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alabama Cotton Tenant Farmer\u2019s Wife by Walker Evans, 1936 Photograph: The Art Institute of Chicago\n\nThings were especially difficult for those outside of major cities. \u201cLife was quite bitter,\u201d said Siegel. \u201cThe photos showed the plight of everyday Americans, particularly on farms. At the height of the depression, there was a 25% unemployment rate and many families were devastated.\u201d\n\nIn 1936, Evans focused on a series of photos in Alabama, showing the lives of farmworkers, including his famed portrait of Allie Mae Burroughs, the wife of a farmer, who he photographed leaning against her family\u2019s cabin.\n\n\u201cHe liked the unvarnished quality, the lines on her face, which started looking like the line of the wood behind her, she is humble,\u201d said Siegel. \u201cIt became a classic portrait of what someone looked like at the height of the depression.\u201d\n\nThe exhibit opens with a sculpture of an American eagle by John Haley Bellamy, which was made from gold leaf-painted pine. It signals a time when the country pulled together to suffer through difficult times.\n\n\u201cMany of these objects popular in the 1930s were celebrating nationalism,\u201d said McGoey. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at nationalism in that period and are asking questions about what constitutes an American aesthetic, we\u2019re also inviting visitors to consider what they see of America in this art, who is depicted here from America?\n\n\u201cThrough the symbol of the eagle and nationalism, it\u2019s an invite for critique, how far we have come, and how far we still need to go.\u201d", "description": "In a powerful new exhibition, photography and folk art are used to provide potentially relevant lessons on how to deal with economic hardship", "authors": ["Nadja Sayej"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/920eac82cbcf132290040d134016617bfcb6d505/0_241_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=716a4fbd3e6b0bfe5bab56a19990d7d5", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
