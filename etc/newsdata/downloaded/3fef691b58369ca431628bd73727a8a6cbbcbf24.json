Still, he was rather dominant for seven innings, striking out 12 batters and finishing off each one with an off-speed pitch.\n\nPOPE FRANCIS' INADVERTENT NEW ORLEANS SAINTS PRAYER GOES VIRAL\n\nThe Cardinals, quite simply, can't hit in this NLCS: They have a grand total of two runs and 11 hits through three games. Washington's three starters have a combined ERA \u2014 no calculator necessary for this one \u2014 of 0.00.\n\nYes, that's zero-point-zero-zero.\n\nNow it's Patrick Corbin's chance to see if he can match his rotation-mates. The $140 million lefty will start for the Nationals in Game 4 on Tuesday night, when they can close out a sweep at home. Rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson will be on the mound for the Cardinals.\n\nWashington hasn't put a baseball team in the World Series since 1933, when the Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. The nation's capital owns only one MLB championship; the Senators won all the way back in 1924. There wasn't even a baseball team at all in Washington for more than three decades until the Montreal Expos franchise moved to town before the 2005 season and was renamed the Nationals.\n\nUntil this season, the Nationals hadn't won a playoff series, going 0-4 since 2012, but they sure look as if they're making up for lost time.\n\nIt all starts with the pitching.\n\nAgainst S\u00e1nchez in Game 1, the first hit for the Cardinals arrived with their 27th batter. Against Scherzer in Game 2, it was their 21st batter. But even when the Cardinals did something right against Strasburg, they erased it by doing something wrong.\n\nTheir fourth batter, Marcell Ozuna, doubled to the left field corner in the second, then quickly erased himself with some poor baserunning, going too far toward third on a comebacker and getting tagged out by Strasburg, who is enjoying a postseason to remember.\n\nHe was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft, then was infamously shut down before the playoffs three years later to protect his surgically repaired right elbow. Strasburg is now hale and hearty, throwing 117 pitches Monday, his most since totaling 118 in a May 2017 game.\n\nAnd this sort of October excellence is what the Nationals were hoping for: Strasburg now has a 3-0 record and 1.64 ERA, with 33 strikeouts and one walk \u2014 he didn't issue a free pass Monday \u2014 in 22 innings this postseason.\n\nMuch to the delight of a red towel-twirling crowd of 43,675, Washington's batters kept delivering, led by Kendrick, who has eight RBIs in the past four games, including a 10th-inning grand slam in Game 5 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Nationals roughed up Jack Flaherty for four runs, all in the third inning; the Cardinals' 23-year-old starter hadn't allowed that many in a game since July 2, a span of 18 appearances.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSeven of Washington's eight runs came with two outs, and there were contributions from up and down the lineup: Ryan Zimmerman delivered two run-scoring hits, Victor Robles homered in his return after a five-game absence with a leg injury, and Anthony Rendon heard \"MVP!\" chants after a slick defensive play at third base and an RBI double.", "description": "Stephen Strasburg took his turn silencing the Cardinals' struggling bats, Nationals postseason star Howie Kendrick doubled three times and drove in three more runs, and Washington moved one win from the city's first World Series appearance in 86 years by beating St. Louis 8-1 Monday night to take a 3-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Stephen-Strasburg-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
