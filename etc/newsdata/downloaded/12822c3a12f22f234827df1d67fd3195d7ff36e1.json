Are books providing some comfort?\n\nHistorical fiction. I\u2019m so raw, emotionally, that I can\u2019t read contemporary fiction because so much of it is dystopian and I can\u2019t cope with dystopian ideas right now. I am reading The Cadfael Chronicles by Ellis Peters, a series set in the 12th century about a monk who solves mysteries. They are soothing \u2013 like comfort food.\n\nI am also reading Tales of the Dervishes by Idries Shah, an anthology of Sufi teaching stories, and Dark Night of the Soul by 16th-century Spanish poet and mystic St John of the Cross, about spiritual awakening.\n\nYour most recent books, Birth of the Plantagenets, are set in the 12th century. Where did that interest come from?\n\nI think I must have lived then in another life. It was a phenomenal period of civilisation. There was a great flowering of culture, particularly music and architecture, as well as the troubadour poets.\n\nI have read a lot about that period and the characters that really jump out at you are Henry and Eleanor. They were magnificent creatures. I highly recommend Henry II by W.L. Warren and Eleanor of Aquitaine by Alison Weir.\n\nBefore you wrote your prize-winning novel Winter in Jerusalem, you read the Bible from cover to cover. Why?\n\nBecause I knew that if you don\u2019t know the Bible, you can\u2019t begin to understand Israel. I don\u2019t recommend reading it all in one hit, though. It\u2019s too overwhelming \u2013 like eating a whole cow at one meal. It gave me serious psychic, spiritual and mental indigestion.\n\nIn your first public statement after your husband\u2019s death, you quoted from the Bible, saying, \u201cthe golden bowl is broken\u201d. What did you mean?\n\nThat is a quote from Ecclesiastes about life and death. You\u2019ve got to know some of the original Hebrew to understand it. It says, \u201cIf the silver chain be loosed, and the golden bowl be broken,\u201d and it\u2019s referring to a light hanging on a silver chain, over a golden bowl, which holds the oil that keeps the light burning. If the chain breaks, the bowl will break and the light will be extinguished. I re-read passages from the Bible quite often. One of my favourites is from Genesis. It says, \u201cAnd Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.\" It sounds boring, but it\u2019s the wrestle with the angel, and the breaking of the day is the awakening of consciousness. That is my guiding light; you have to keep wrestling with the angel, your spiritual nature, until it reveals the higher truths.\n\nWere you always a big reader?", "description": "The author of Winter in Jerusalem, and widow of Bob Hawke, on digesting the Bible and her latest instalment in the Birth of the Plantagenets series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2225%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_617%2C$y_223/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ec48898271b5baf96442e5effadbea04f770becd", "published_at": "2019-06-20"}
