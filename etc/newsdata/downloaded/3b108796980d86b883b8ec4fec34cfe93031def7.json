New research published today suggests that the issue could very well be to do with the elitist and frankly unhelpful way employers view university degrees.\n\nAccording to recruiter Milkround, graduates of the universities considered to be the \u201cbest 24\u201d in the UK, are more likely to find work soon after graduating than those leaving other institutions. Four fifths of those graduating from Russell Group universities were in full-time employment within just weeks of leaving; only two thirds of those from the rest managed the same.\n\nGoing to one of these universities is, in short, good for your career. But it does not follow that recruiting from these places is good for your business.\n\nMilkround urged employers to avoid filtering applicants by institution and warned about the dangerous impact on social mobility if they continue to do so.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies found that in 2017, Russell Group graduates earned an average of \u00a333,500 after five years - about 40 per cent more than those who had studied at other universities. So this really matters, and these decisions about first jobs can have a lifelong effect on earning potential and opportunities. But what else are employers supposed to do? They need to make the cut somewhere and why not choose those who went to the most prestigious institutions?\n\nThe problem for social mobility isn\u2019t necessarily the practice of filtering applicants by university though, but that modern employers don\u2019t really know very much about how universities operate today. According to the World Economic Forum, most degree qualifications only have a life cycle of five years. And in five years\u2019 time, the job that you\u2019re going into, and even the sector you\u2019re working in, may not exist.\n\nThere are now entire companies, such as HowNow, whose business purpose is to help employees switch up their skills to fit their job as it changes. HowNow\u2019s chief executive Nelson Sivalingam argues companies recruiting on institution name only are putting their own future at risk.\n\nSo using the Russell Group as a byword for \u201celite\u201d, or even \u201cmost intelligent\u201d, is lazy. It\u2019s also outdated, because it ignores individual universities\u2019 own strengths and weaknesses. Not every one of those 24 institutions is good at everything. Milkround is right to infer that it filters out promising candidates from those social and economic backgrounds less represented at the top universities, and who also may be far more suitable and ready for work.\n\nThese young people can be found by filtering by institution, however - but only if you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for. If you want a graphic designer, you\u2019re better off with someone from Kingston, part of the University of London; a racing car engineer would be best found graduating from Swansea University. Neither of these are in the Russell Group.\n\nSo if employers want to put an end to the pointless hours their HR teams spend trawling through irrelevant CVs, they should find out exactly which universities and which specific courses are creating the kind of graduates they need right now. Because it probably isn\u2019t where they think it is.", "description": "Feminist campaigners say that everyone should carry themselves with the confidence of a mediocre white man.
