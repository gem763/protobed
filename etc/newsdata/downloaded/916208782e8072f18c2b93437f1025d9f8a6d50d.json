The ruling raises the possibility that the fund could pay substantially more than it agreed to in the 2016 deal with prosecutors.\n\nThe investors, former equity holders of the Canadian mining company Africo Resources Ltd., have argued that they are entitled to as much as $1.8 billion in restitution.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe figure represents the value of shares that Africo held in a Congolese mine in 2006, had it been developed as planned, according to an expert hired by the investors. Both the Och-Ziff subsidiary and the Justice Department, which opposed the investors\u2019 claim, have said the estimate is problematic.\n\nAfrico\u2019s rights were stripped from the company, and obtained by the Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, who consolidated control of the mining venture by paying millions of dollars in bribes using funds from an investment by Och-Ziff, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nIn a decision handed down last week, Judge Garaufis said the Africo investors qualified as victims under the Mandatory Restitution Act of 1996. But he said he wasn\u2019t yet prepared to rule on whether the investors were entitled to restitution as a result, or how much that restitution would be.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the court does not believe that claimants are entitled to a restitution award based on the full projected value of the Kalukundi Mine as if it had been developed,\u201d the judge said.\n\nJudge Garaufis\u2019s order was unsealed on Tuesday at the request of Och-Ziff, a public company, which cited its disclosure obligations to investors. A representative of Och-Ziff declined to further comment on the order.\n\nThe judge has asked Och-Ziff and the Justice Department to submit further arguments on the group\u2019s request. On Friday, the hedge fund filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider his ruling.\n\nSince reaching its settlement with the Justice Department, Och-Ziff has taken steps to distance itself from the bribery allegations.\n\nThe hedge fund replaced its chief executive and founder, Daniel Och, and has plans to change its name to Sculptor Capital Management, effective Sept. 12.\n\nIn addition to the $213 million criminal settlement, the hedge fund in 2016 also reached a parallel civil agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, paying $199 million in profit that the agency said it obtained from corrupt dealings in Africa. Och-Ziff was also required to retain an independent monitor to oversee compliance with the criminal and civil settlements.\n\nMr. Och and the fund\u2019s former chief financial officer, Joel M. Frank, also settled charges with the regulator that they violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, with Mr. Och agreeing to pay a nearly $2.2 million fine.\n\nAfter the settlements, Och-Ziff was disqualified from relying on certain fundraising exemptions. Several of its largest investors stopped doing business with the fund, and average quarterly fundraising fell from $1.1 billion to $122 million, according to the fund.\n\nIn June, Och-Ziff renewed its request to the SEC for an exemption to the fundraising rule in question. The agency granted the request.\n\nA lawyer for the Africo investors didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nA lawyer for the Africo investors didn\u2019t return a request for comment Friday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it was a lawyer for Africo.
