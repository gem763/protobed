Wall Street is back in rally mode", "language": "en", "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Thursday on expectations of a de-escalation in trade tensions after Washington and Beijing agreed to hold high-level talks next month, while strong U.S. economic data eased fears of a domestic slowdown.\n\nAfter anxiety about a deepening trade war triggered a sell-off in late July and early August, leading to speculation that a decade-long bull market was ending, the S&P 500 has largely recovered and is now less than 2% short of its July 26 record high close. The benchmark index has climbed 2.4% in the past two sessions.\n\nChina and the United States agreed to hold talks in early October in Washington, boosting markets as investors bet on a thaw in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, which has taken a toll on global growth.\n\nAlternating signs of improvement and deterioration in the U.S.-China trade war, often based on tweets and comments from Trump, have repeatedly sparked volatility on Wall Street in recent months.\n\n\u201cWhether the talks occur or not, we\u2019ll see. And whether they are productive, we\u2019re skeptical. But the market loves it,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.\n\nRelated Coverage High-flying IPO stocks sell off after quarterly results\n\nThe S&P information technology index .SPLRCT rose 2.1%, while financials .SPSY jumped 1.9%, the two rising the most among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors.\n\nThe interest rate-sensitive S&P 500 Banks Index .SPXBK surged 2.5%, following a rise in U.S. Treasury yields.

Investors will keep a close watch on the crucial nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2019.
