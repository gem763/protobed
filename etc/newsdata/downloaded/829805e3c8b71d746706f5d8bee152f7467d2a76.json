Indonesia does not have a formal maritime dispute with Beijing in the South China Sea, although its ships have sometimes clashed with Chinese vessels.\n\nMalaysia's decision to cut the scene was the latest sign authorities could be taking a tougher stance towards Beijing, as it has traditionally not been vocal in opposing Chinese incursions into waters off its shores.\n\nIt came after the foreign minister said this week the navy should be strengthened to better defend Malaysian waters.\n\nBeijing has based its claims to almost all the resource-rich South China Sea, which is home to important shipping routes, on historic documents. As well as the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are rival claimants.\n\nA 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling said China's claim was without basis, something Beijing has ignored.\n\nburs-sr/ind", "description": "A scene in the film", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/wire-19880162-1571395081-632_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
