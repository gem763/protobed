Climate change is real\u2019: Rep. Rooney", "language": "en", "text": "\u2018I\u2019m a conservative Republican and I believe climate change is real. It\u2019s time for my fellow Republicans in Congress to stop treating this environmental threat as something abstract and political and recognize that it\u2019s already affecting their constituents in their daily lives.\u2019\n\nSo begins a Wednesday op-ed from Rep. Francis Rooney, a Republican sent to Washington by Florida\u2019s 19th congressional district, a densely populated area covering roughly Fort Myers to Marco Island, and one that\u2019s still recovering from 2017\u2019s devastating Hurricane Irma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from a coastal district that is directly affected by these issues every day. In fact, my home state of Florida is ground zero for the adverse effects of climate change,\u201d the multimillionaire, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, writes for Politico\u2019s \u201cThe Agenda\u201d section.\n\nIrma\u2019s damage was put at about $50 billion, making it Florida\u2019s costliest hurricane.\n\nRelated: Bill Gates, Ban Ki-moon and others propose $1.8 trillion investment over a decade for climate-change adaptation\n\n\u201cAs these extreme weather events increase in frequency and intensity, Congress \u2014 especially my Republican colleagues \u2014 needs to recognize the costs, disruptions and global security risks that climate change will bring to both our domestic and foreign policy, and the federal budget,\u201d says Rooney, who was U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See from 2005 until 2008.\n\n\u201cIf we want to show America that we\u2019re the party of the future, then it\u2019s time for all Republicans to return to their roots as champions of our environment,\u201d he concludes, recalling the historical feats for conservation by Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon\u2019s Clean Air Act.\n\nMore in Key Words: Democrats\u2019 fracking ban would hurt U.S. economy, give edge to Russia: IEA\u2019s Birol\n\nRead: T.
