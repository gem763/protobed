Already lashing the coast of Florida, dangerous winds, torrential rain, and coastal flooding are forecast to spread north through the Carolinas.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, tropical storm conditions had reached Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast. Although Dorian is no longer the Category 5 powerhouse it was on Labor Day, it has grown in size, its hurricane and tropical-storm-force winds covering more territory.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Why we can expect more-intense hurricanes in the future]\n\nNow a strong Category 2 storm, Dorian slammed into the northwestern Bahamas over the weekend with the historic full fury of its 185-mile-per-hour winds and 23-foot storm surge.

(NOAA via CIRA/RAMMB)\n\nAttention now turns to U.S. mainland impacts, with hurricane warnings and watches hoisted from the Florida coastline northward to the North Carolina Outer Banks.\n\nTropical-storm conditions, with sustained winds of greater than 39 mph, are already affecting Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast, and and are expected to expand north over the Space Coast Tuesday night and farther north toward Jacksonville on Wednesday. Hurricane conditions, with sustained winds of at least 74 mph, are possible if the storm wobbles westward.\n\n[Hurricane Dorian takes aim at the Southeast coast: City-by-city forecasts]\n\nFarther north, the Hurricane Center projects a life-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds from coastal Georgia to the North Carolina Outer Banks, \u201cregardless of the track of Dorian\u2019s center.\"\n\nThe latest on Hurricane Dorian\n\nAs of 6 p.m. on Tuesday, the storm was 125 miles east of Melbourne, Florida and moving northwest at 6 mph. The storm\u2019s peak sustained winds were 110 mph, making it a high-end Category 2 storm. Dorian is expected to maintain its current intensity through Wednesday.\n\nRadar from Central Florida showed Dorian\u2019s outer rain bands pivoting inland producing heavy rain and strong winds. \u201cWind gusts to tropical storm force are now occurring along the Treasure Coast of Florida,\u201d the National Hurricane Center wrote. A weather station on Sebastien Inlet recently clocked a sustained wind of 38 mph and a gust to 53 mph.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Melbourne warned 60 mph gusts are possible into the evening.\n\nSep 3, 530PM | Inland Residents. Rain bands will move across the area tonight. Expect sudden increases in winds up to 40-50mph in these squalls. The most intense may produce gusts up to 60mph.

The Hurricane Center wrote the area of hurricane-force winds is likely to expand some in the next 24 to 36 hours.\n\nThe latest forecast from the Hurricane Center calls for Dorian to remain a Category 2 storm as it makes its closest pass to Florida and northward to the Carolinas.\n\nForecast for Florida\n\nThe forecast track keeps the storm\u2019s most dangerous winds and highest levels of storm-surge flooding from coming ashore in the Sunshine State, but brings the storm close enough to bring heavy rains, damaging winds and storm surge flooding to the east coast of Florida.\n\nHowever, hurricanes do not always behave as forecast. Despite being Earth\u2019s most massive and powerful storms, they\u2019re remarkably sensitive to internal and external hiccups. These storms can wobble east or west as they move generally north, for example, like a spinning top on a table.\n\n[With Hurricane Dorian \u2018dangerously close,\u2019 Floridians wonder: Will it turn?]\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t take much of a wobble to bring the core of the storm ashore over Florida, especially along the Space Coast, where land featuring expensive infrastructure juts out a few more miles to the east of the rest of the Peninsula. On the other hand, if the storm stays on course, the coast may only experience tropical storm conditions.\n\n\n\nShops windows are seen boarded up as Hurricane Dorian approaches in Deerfield Beach, Florida on September 2, 2019. (Michele Eve Sandberg/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for much of the Florida east coast from Sebastien Inlet north.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is warning that \u201clife-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of the Florida east coast.\u201d In addition, water levels along the coast are forecast to rise \u201cwell in advance of the arrival of strong winds.\u201d\n\nAreas that are especially vulnerable to storm-surge flooding, such as Jacksonville, Fla., could once again see significant flooding depending on the exact track and timing of the storm.\n\nAccording to the Weather Service office in Jacksonville, if the storm tracks close enough to northeastern Florida, the result could be particularly severe. Among the possible effects, it listed: \u201cLarge areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\u201d\n\nThe latest storm-surge forecast shows that if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide, the area north of Volusia County could see three to five feet of water above ground. The surge is forecast to reach 2 to 4 feet in the zone farther south from Jupiter Inlet through Volusia County.\n\nRainfall along the Florida coast could reach 3 to 6 inches.\n\nForecast for coastal Georgia, Carolinas and Virginia\n\nConditions are expected to deteriorate early Wednesday in coastal Georgia, late Wednesday in South Carolina and Thursday in North Carolina. Where and whether Dorian makes landfall will depend on the exact trajectory of its turn relative to the coast as it heads north and then starts to bend northeastward.\n\nScenarios ranging from a direct hit to a scrape are possible in Georgia and the Carolinas based on available forecasts. A direct hit is most likely in North Carolina because its coast sticks out into the ocean farthest east while Georgia may only get scraped because its coast is more tucked in.\n\nA tropical storm warning is in effect for coastal Georgia, while a hurricane warning covers the entire South Carolina coast north to Surf City, North Carolina. A hurricane watch spans from Duck to the North Carolina/Virginia border.\n\nThe Georgia and South Carolina coastlines are particularly vulnerable to storm surge flooding, even from a storm that does not make landfall, due to the shape of the land on and just offshore, as well as the effects of sea level rise and land subsidence over time. The surge could reach 3 to 5 feet in Georgia and 4 to 7 feet from the South Carolina coast north to Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n\nLocations even farther north from Virginia Beach to the Delmarva and even up to Cape Cod could get clipped by the storm Friday and Saturday, with heavy rains, tropical storm force winds and coastal flooding.\n\nA tropical storm watch is in effect from the North Carolina/Virginia border to Chincoteague, including the Virginia Beach area, as well as the Chesapeake Bay from Smith Point southward.\n\n\u201cThe risk of wind and rain impacts along portions of the Virginia coast and the southern Chesapeake Bay are increasing,\u201d the Hurricane Center wrote. \u201cResidents in these areas should continue to monitor the progress of Dorian.\u201d\n\nModel forecasts and uncertainties\n\nWhile computer model projections all show that Hurricane Dorian will remain just offshore Florida\u2019s coast, there is some uncertainty in the forecast farther north.\n\n[Tracking the path of Hurricane Dorian]\n\nWhereas on Monday many computer models suggested Dorian may not make landfall anywhere on the East Coast, more forecasts on Tuesday suggest the storm center could come ashore in the Carolinas.\n\n\n\nGroup of simulations from American (blue) and European (red) computer models from Tuesday afternoon for Hurricane Dorian. Each color strand represents a different model simulation with slightly altered input data.

The bold red line is the average of all of the European model simulations, while the bold blue one is the average of all the American model simulations. (StormVistaWxModels.com)\n\n\u201cThe track envelope has edged closer to the coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina and the NHC track has been adjusted in that direction,\u201d the Hurricane Center wrote. \u201cA track that close to the coast, even if landfall does not occur, is likely to bring dangerous winds, life-threatening storm surge, and flooding rains across the eastern portions of the Carolinas.\u201d\n\nNorthwest Bahamas took a nightmarish, 40 hour direct hit\n\nGrand Bahama Island has suffered an onslaught from this storm that few places on Earth have experienced, remaining in the eyewall of a major Category 4 or 5 storm for 40 hours. The eyewall is the region of the storm surrounding its center that contains its strongest winds and generates the most destructive storm-surge flooding.\n\n[Dorian\u2019s horrific eyewall slammed Grand Bahama Island for 40 hours straight]\n\nThis is a storm that may have reshaped the northwestern Bahamas, particularly Abaco and Grand Bahama Island, for decades.\n\nAs Dorian approached over the weekend, the Hurricane Center used dire language to describe the threat, including the word \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d Unfortunately, it appears that was the result, particularly in the Abaco Islands and on Grand Bahama Island.\n\n[Slow-moving Hurricane Dorian pounding the Bahamas for a third punishing day; children among the dead]\n\nHow much has #Dorian moved in the last 24 hours?

But in this case, the storm reached Grand Bahama and stopped moving, with Hurricane Hunter aircraft finding essentially no movement each time they got to the storm\u2019s center. In addition to wind gusts up to 220 mph and a 23-foot storm surge, up to 40 inches of rain may have fallen in some areas.\n\nAccording to one analysis, Dorian has been the slowest-moving major hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic. Between 3 a.m. on Labor Day and 5 a.m. on Tuesday, the storm moved just 30 miles in 28 hours.\n\nBefore and After from Marsh Harbour in the Abacos of the Northwest Bahamas.

On Monday evening, the Hurricane Center released a statement saying it expected additional \u201cextreme destruction\u201d on the island overnight due to a combination of extreme winds and storm surge flooding.\n\nAlthough the worst of the storm had lifted north of the northwestern Bahamas Tuesday afternoon, the Hurricane Center warned dangerous winds and a life-threatening storm surge could persist into the evening.\n\nDorian\u2019s place in history\n\nDorian is tied for the second-strongest storm (as judged by its maximum sustained winds) ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, behind Hurricane Allen of 1980, and, after striking the northern Bahamas, tied with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane for the title of the strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall.\n\nIt is only the second Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the Bahamas since 1983, according to Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University. The only other is Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The international hurricane database goes back continuously only to 1983.\n\n[Hurricane Dorian has smashed all sorts of intensity records in the Atlantic Ocean]\n\nThe storm\u2019s peak sustained winds rank as the strongest so far north in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida on record. Its pressure, which bottomed out at 910 millibars, is significantly lower than Hurricane Andrew\u2019s when it made landfall in South Florida in 1992 (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm).\n\nWith Dorian attaining Category 5 strength, this is the first time since the start of the satellite era (in the 1960s) that Category 5 storms have developed in the tropical Atlantic for four straight years, according to Capital Weather Gang tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy.\n\nThe unusual strength of Dorian and the rate at which it developed is consistent with the expectation of more intense hurricanes in a warming world. Some studies have shown increases in hurricane rapid intensification, and modeling studies project an uptick in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms.\n\nDorian may have also set a record for the longest period of Category 4 and 5 conditions to strike one location in the North Atlantic Basin since the dawn of the satellite era, but historical data is relatively sparse.", "description": "Hurricane watches posted as far north as North Carolina Outer Banks, as tropical storm conditions lash Florida.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "September At Pm", "Andrew Freedman Edits"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/25D2_IW5LBEL6yv_CrK1Kl2sqSk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S44KXFZ6DNFIDCRM2DH2PF5EPM.png"}
