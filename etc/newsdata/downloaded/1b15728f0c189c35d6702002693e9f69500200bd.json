Right, his father Ghaleb Makki outside court. Mr Makki screamed at jurors as they delivered their verdict\n\nShe also described him as 'no different than any other 17-year-old in the area'.\n\nStephanie told the Sunday Times: 'Nobody can know the detail of everything that your kids get up to. All you can do is rely on them to make positive choices based on the values that have been instilled in them throughout their upbringing.'\n\nYousef, who was from an Anglo-Lebanese family from Burnage, south Manchester, had won a scholarship to the prestigious \u00a312,000-a-year Manchester Grammar School.\n\nThe court heard how hours before the stabbing, Boy B arranged a \u00a345 cannabis deal and the teenagers planned to rob the drug dealer, a 'soft target'.\n\nBut the robbery went wrong and Yousef and Boy B fled, leaving Molnar to take a beating.\n\nMolnar was cleared of murder and sentenced to a 16-month detention training order \u2013 12 months for perverting the course of justice, and four months for possession of the knife\n\nAfter they met up again, Molnar then later pushed Yousef who called him a 'p****' and punched him in the face.\n\nMolnar told the jury Yousef pulled out a knife and he responded by also taking out a knife and his victim was accidentally stabbed.\n\nSpeaking about the killing and the subsequent trial, Molnar's mother Stephanie said: 'Circumstances on the night of March 2 led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife. He was found not guilty to the charges of murder and manslaughter, based on self-defence, in a unanimous verdict.\n\n'The events of that night were a tragedy. These were three friends going out on a Saturday. They should all still be here to lead fulfilling lives but they are not.\n\n'I cannot imagine what Yousef's parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this.\n\n'Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence and the impact of this acceptance is massive.\n\n'He will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.\n\nYousef's furious father could be seen screaming at police officers outside the court after the verdict\n\n'We are also acutely aware that the hurt and loss that Yousef's family is experiencing are infinitely greater than anything we are going through and nothing I can say can make up for or change that.\n\n'There were no winners in this case.\n\n'We fully support all the positive steps to celebrate Yousef's life and anything positive in the future that can come from this tragedy is something we would welcome and contribute to in whatever way possible.'\n\nHowever, her words were slammed by Yousef's sister, who described them as 'self-serving'.\n\nJade Akoum, 28, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I thought a normal thing to do would be to apologise and lay low. I wouldn't want their help and I don't want to forgive them. They haven't once reached out to us.\n\n'Saying they want to celebrate Yousef's life? Your son killed my brother.'\n\nYousef's mother Deborah Makki, a psychiatric nurse, planted a tree in his memory on the grounds of his school in Manchester earlier this year\n\nYousef's family reacted with fury after the controversial verdict in March with his father Ghaleb Makki shouting: 'F*** you! Where's the justice for my son! Where's the justice?'.\n\nBoy B had bought the knives online using a false name and had them posted from China to a friend's address, the court heard.\n\nOfficers later found a dark coloured 'flick knife' behind a low boundary wall near the scene of the killing plus a silver coloured lock knife in some bushes and recovered a flick knife from down a grid.\n\nDespite the privileged backgrounds of both defendants, they led 'double lives'.\n\nThey would post videos on social media, making threats and posing with 'shanks' or knives.\n\nIn court, Molinar broke down in tears and said: 'I got more annoyed. I [took] it out straight away, I don't really know what I did, kind of lifted my arm up. I didn't realise anything had happened at first.'\n\nDespite the money spent on his expensive education, Molnar did not 'get on' with his family or appreciate his parents' largesse; he could pick his friends but not his parents he said.\n\nHis parents arrived with their son on the first day of the trial, accompanied by their own security detail.\n\nBoth parents accompanied their son to court each day of the trial.\n\nThey divorced when their son was aged 13, the father living in a \u00a3500,000 three-bedroom townhouse in Hale village and the mother in a second five-bedroom house in the village, worth around \u00a3900,000.\n\nThe upmarket village south of Manchester, popular with minor celebrities and premier league footballers, was where Molnar was raised.\n\nHis life was a world away from the street gangsters in the Drill music he listened to.\n\nHow insult-laden 'diss tracks' and rapping about gang culture from disaffected inner-city youths related to him is unclear.\n\nHe lived in a low-crime, high wealth Cheshire village, but adapted entirely different accents and mannerisms, imitating the street gangsters he listened to.\n\nMolnar sported a south central LA style neck bandana, keeping his weed and 'shank' or knife in an Armani man bag.\n\nHe thought knives were 'cool' and routinely smoked cannabis from the age of 15, telling the jury at his trial most of his peers smoked the drug and it was 'socially acceptable'.", "description": "Joshua Molnar was cleared of the murder of Yousef Makki, also 17,\u00a0despite admitting to stabbing him  after an argument\u00a0in Hale Barns, an upmarket village in Cheshire, on March 2.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/09/19355832-0-image-a-10_1570350544174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
