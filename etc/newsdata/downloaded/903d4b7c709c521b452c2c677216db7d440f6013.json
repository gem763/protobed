Consovoy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, the newest member of the federal district court in Washington, sympathized with the president\u2019s argument in hearings this week and asked all parties to come up with a solution.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump raised the concern that his claims could become ripe and then moot almost instantaneously and without notice to him or the Court, thereby depriving the Court of jurisdiction to decide his claims,\u201d Nichols concluded in a four-page order \u00adimplementing the proposal suggested by New York state officials.\n\nAD\n\nAndrew Amer, special litigation counsel for New York Attorney General Letitia James, had proposed that state tax officials not turn over Trump\u2019s records until seven days after Nichols decides whether the Trump lawsuit belonged before him in Washington, or if it should be heard before a federal judge in New York City or another judge in New York.\n\nAD\n\nAmer argued for moving the case to New York, saying Trump\u2019s lawsuit involves a New York state law and \u201calleges no events or omissions\u201d in Washington by state officials.\n\n\u201cA New York court would be the more appropriate forum to adjudicate a constitutional challenge to a New York statute,\u201d Amer wrote.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the court has accepted our reasonable proposal for how to move forward in this premature lawsuit filed by President Trump. We look forward to continuing to make our case in court,\" James said Friday in a statement after the ruling, adding, \"This law is constitutional, and we will vigorously defend it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNichols set a hearing for New York\u2019s arguments on Aug. 29. He also ordered the state to notify the court if the committee requests Trump\u2019s returns.\n\nHouse General Counsel Douglas N. Letter urged Nichols to deny Trump\u2019s requests and dismiss the House from the suit, saying the committee\u2019s decision whether to use the new state law is \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from court review under the Constitution\u2019s grant of legislative powers to Congress.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that courts lack the power to do what Mr. Trump asks,\u201d Letter wrote. Barring lawmakers from even requesting Trump\u2019s state returns would appear to mark the first time any court overrode Congress\u2019s freedom to conduct legislative work, even before lawmakers have taken any action.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is of particular concern where the injunction against a body of Congress would be issued at the behest of the President, raising glaring separation of powers concerns. This is precisely what the Framers of the Constitution wished to guard against,\u201d Letter wrote.\n\nNichols\u2019s decision came in a wave of litigation mounted over the president\u2019s attempts to shield his personal finances from investigators, including congressional Democrats, state lawmakers and regulators.\n\nTrump has sued the committee chairman, Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), and New York officials to prevent them from using New York\u2019s TRUST Act. The law, signed by New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) and enacted July 7, allows New York tax officials to turn over Trump\u2019s state tax returns to three House committees, provided the New York officials receive requests \u201cin furtherance of a legitimate task of Congress.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew York lawmakers presented the new law as a means of empowering congressional oversight by unearthing details of the president\u2019s past business dealings, his income and other personal financial information that he has refused to release via his federal tax returns.\n\nTrump called the pursuit of his private financial information an attempt at political gain, and accused New York lawmakers of violating his First Amendment rights by trying to discriminate and retaliate against him \u201cfor his speech and politics.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in May denied a request by Neal\u2019s panel for Trump\u2019s federal returns, prompting a separate lawsuit by the House panel to enforce its subpoena .\n\nAD\n\nIn that suit, Neal\u2019s committee alleged that it has not been able to carry out its duties \u201cbecause the President has declined to follow the practice of every elected President since Richard Nixon of voluntarily disclosing their tax returns.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe committee seeks six years of Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of an investigation into the audit program at the Internal Revenue Service. The committee invoked its \u201cunfettered access\u201d to tax- return information to oversee the Treasury Department, the IRS and the nation\u2019s tax laws under authority enacted after the Teapot Dome government corruption scandal in the 1920s.\n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the District is hearing that case, and last week denied a request by Trump\u2019s lawyers to hear both cases, deciding they were unrelated.\n\nAD\n\nThe New York-related case was randomly reassigned to Nichols, who was appointed to the federal bench in June by Trump.\n\nMcFadden, also a Trump appointee, cast doubt on the president\u2019s new lawsuit, noting the committee has not made any request, and that the Constitution\u2019s speech-or-debate clause generally bars courts from looking to lawmaker\u2019s alleged motives in ruling on the legality of their actions.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump\u2019s move to shield finances from Ways and Means Committee secured a preliminary victory.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
