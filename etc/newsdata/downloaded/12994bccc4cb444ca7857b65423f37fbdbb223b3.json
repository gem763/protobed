They also have 242 followers and have the hashtag #F**kAmerica in their bio.\n\nThe only reason we know anything about them is that they got some attention Tuesday for posting a photo of men and women with rifles along with the message, \u201cWe\u2019re ready for your #CivilWar2, Fascists.\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s certain: the photo isn\u2019t new; it\u2019s of the Phoenix John Brown Gun Club back in 2017. The gun club\u2019s Facebook page does connect the club with \u201cRedneck Revolt,\u201d a far-left, anti-capitalist group, though. (They have the hammer and sickle in their Twitter bio too.)\n\nSo, while we ponder whether or not this is an elaborate parody or not, see if the following tweet makes you quake in your boots.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not the wisest thing to tweet to the president, but you do you.\n\nGreat parody account! \u2014 Adam (@idrawrobots) October 1, 2019\n\nWow- I bet these guys could totally take on a Canadian granny in a walker trying to cross the street! \u2014 Can't Stop The Corn Pop (@Fenway_Nation) October 1, 2019\n\nCongrats \ud83c\udf8a you understand the second amendment is necessary to fight fascism.
