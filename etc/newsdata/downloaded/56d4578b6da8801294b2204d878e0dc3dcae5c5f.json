Of course, there is a slice of the electoral pie for whom the exact opposite can be said. The question the president has to concern himself with is whether or not there are enough of the remaining slices of the population who\u2019ll pull the lever for him just over a year from now. That\u2019s the argument he has to make.\n\nThere\u2019s a belief that the economy will be enough to push the president over the line, and traditionally that would be true. But Donald Trump is anything but a traditional president.\n\nThe thing about the economy is people, once it\u2019s been good for awhile, start to take it for granted. It\u2019s like the tax cuts \u2013 where people saw a noticeable increase in their take-home pay, then voted out a bunch of the very people who cut taxes to put it there. Elections aren\u2019t about rewarding what someone has done, they\u2019re about getting behind what someone wants to do.\n\nPresident Trump needs to spend a little more time making the case for what he\u2019d do in a second term, not just how bad a first term of whatever Democrat wins the nomination would be.\n\nThe strength of the economy does weird things to voters. When they don\u2019t have to worry about finding a job, when things are good, the minds of the public can wander to crazy ideas.\n\nThe thing about liberty is it\u2019s always under threat from unscrupulous people. When people are struggling, they\u2019re more likely to follow someone telling them they have the answers, that a government plan will solve or address whatever it is they\u2019re up against. But when things are good, minds are open to the same seductions, just for different reasons.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at an incredible 3.5 percent, and more people working now than ever before, Democrats can effectively appeal to people\u2019s better nature with one of their favorite tactics: making emotional appeals.\n\nTo sell their horrible programs, Democrats always try to make an emotional argument. Their proposals don\u2019t stand up to logical thought, but emotion overrides logic. That\u2019s part of why they\u2019ve turned their \u201ccrazy\u201d up to 11, keeping their base in a \u201cTRUMP IS A RUSSIAN PUPPET\u201d or \u201cTRUMP\u2019S TAX RETURNS\u201d frenzy. As 2018 showed, it works.\n\nThe emotional appeal in good economic times is about those who are still struggling. \u201cIf things are going well, why not do something for those who aren\u2019t keeping up?\u201d the argument goes. That is usually coupled with a threat, subtle but important, that, \u201cThings could go south for you, and you could need this help in the future too.\u201d\n\nThey seem absurd when you think about them rationally, but they aren\u2019t rational arguments, they are emotional ones. And while they won\u2019t work on most people, to win a presidential election you don\u2019t have to appeal to most people.\n\nSo as crazy as student loan debt forgiveness or \u201cfree\u201d health care are to rational people, those pitches aren\u2019t being made to rational people. And they vote too.\n\nTo counter this, President Trump needs to make an affirmative case for a second term beyond Democrats are awful. Because Democrats are awful, and have been awful for a long time, yet voters have elected them; voters gave them the House of Representatives just last year.\n\nThe media will be working to defeat the president, Democrats will be working to defeat the president. The fight for the undecided voters will be a struggle to convince people to ignore their emotions and embrace their logic, but some voters don\u2019t have that ability. Luckily, that\u2019s where Donald Trump excels.\n\nNo Republican is better at stirring up emotional support in his base while advancing conservative accomplishments. But the president needs to expand that base. Red meat is great, and the base will always eat it up, the trick will be to dangle enough chicken or fish into the middle to get other voters to run to his side. It\u2019s a very narrow tightrope to walk.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "There are a lot of people in this country who .10/15/2019 0:16:42AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ae45da6a-b461-4e5b-a13e-6ed2ef1761a4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
