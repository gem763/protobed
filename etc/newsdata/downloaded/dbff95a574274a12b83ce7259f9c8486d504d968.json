REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nLagardere - whose businesses include publishing house Hachette and Relay news agents - said on Friday it was suing minority shareholder Amber and seeking 84 million euros ($93 million) in damages.\n\nIt accused the fund, which also has a stake in French utility Suez, of leading a \u201cdestabilising campaign\u201d and using smear tactics in the press, adding that these had hurt its share price.\n\nDeteriorating relations between the two come amid heightened sensitivity in France over the role of activist shareholders.\n\nU.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, one of the most prominent activist investors, took a stake in French drinks group Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) last year, and other funds have urged overhauls at several companies.\n\nFrench lawmakers have put forward proposals, including bringing in more transparent disclosure requirements, which could feed into plans by the government to rein in activist funds with measures.\n\nAmber, which invested in Lagardere over three years ago and now holds a stake of around 5.3%, said it would pursue its demands to improve Lagardere\u2019s performance, and reiterated its criticism regarding managers\u2019 compensation at the firm.\n\n\u201cLagardere is hoping to intimidate Amber with this new claim, which is as aggressive as it is baseless,\u201d Amber Capital said. \u201cThe reality of the company\u2019s situation will not change until the managing partners decide to reconsider its strategy and governance.\u201d\n\nLagardere shares were down 2.1% by 0842 GMT and have fallen about 10% this year.\n\nThe group, run by Arnaud Lagardere, who took it on from his late father, has been trying to shrink by selling off assets such as \u201cElle\u201d magazine or French TV channels and refocusing on travel retail and publishing.\n\nIts biggest shareholder is Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund.", "description": "Activist shareholder Amber Capital, which is being sued by Lagardere , said on Monday the lawsuit was baseless and it would continue to seek strategy and management changes at the French publishing group.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440626688&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0HM", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
