Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer. It is called multiple myeloma because the cancer often affects several areas of the body, such as the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs. Symptoms of multiple myeloma include: a persistent dull ache or areas of tenderness in bones, weak bones that break (fracture) easily, tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, repeated infections, kidney problems and bruising and unusual bleeding. It is not known exactly what causes multiple myeloma. However, there is a close link between multiple myeloma and a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). www.myeloma.org.uk Source: NHS\n\nMs Toohill was unable to walk up stairs or leave the house because of the crippling pain, but was only diagnosed after giving birth when she started bleeding heavily.\n\nShe had suffered a broken sternum and crushed discs in her back as a result of the cancer weakening her bones.\n\nFollowing a bone marrow biopsy, she underwent four months of gruelling chemotherapy before having a stem cell transplant.\n\nMs Toohill told the Daily Record she only changed her decision when she realised the treatment she was receiving was going to prolong her life.\n\nMs Toohill, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Catherine, with her husband Robert, 42, told the Record she has learnt to live with her diagnosis and make every second count.\n\nA year later, she and her one-year-old son 'have a wonderful relationship.'\n\nShe added: 'I loved Fraser so much, I wanted to be with him.\n\n'But I didn't want to bond with him because I thought that if I was going to die, then it would kinder on him if he hadn't got to know me.\n\n'I thought the right thing was to spend time with my daughter Catherine, who knew me already and would have memories with me.\n\n'So while my husband spent time with Fraser every day, I hardly ever went to the hospital to visit him.'\n\nHannah Toohil with husband Robert, daughter Catherine, three, and son Fraser, one\n\nOne year on, the cancer is in remission, and though it will return one day, Ms Toohill doesn't allow it to rule her life.\n\nShe told the Record: 'It could be in six months or in six years \u2013 there is no way to predict.\n\n'I'm enjoying living my life, doing as much with my children as I possibly can.
