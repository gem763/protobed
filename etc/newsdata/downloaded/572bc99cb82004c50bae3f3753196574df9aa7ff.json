The investigative journalist was hauled off to DC\u2019s Central Jail, where he spent two days in a cell, and was denied requests to call a lawyer.\n\nThe federal government essentially enlisted the DC police to SWAT me, ensuring that I would be subjected to an early morning raid and then languish in prison for days without even the ability to call an attorney.\n\nThe police eventually told Blumenthal he had been accused of assault, stemming from a months-old standoff at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, DC, back in May. Following the US-backed coup attempt and the expulsion of Venezuelan diplomats, supporters of President Nicolas Maduro occupied the embassy building \u2013 while the crowd backing the self-proclaimed \u2018interim\u2019 leader Juan Guaido besieged the premises for several weeks. The pro-Maduro activists were eventually removed from the embassy by force in a US police raid.\n\nI was arrested on Friday on a COMPLETELY FALSE charge manufactured by the Venezuelan opposition related to their siege of the embassy in DC. I spent 2 days in jail, was shackled for extended periods & was denied my right to call a lawyer. Here's the facts: https://t.co/2Nco0OzQ7P \u2014 Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) October 28, 2019\n\nBlumenthal was one of the few journalists closely following the standoff and sporadic clashes, and insists the assault allegation is totally fabricated to smear him and intimidate independent journalists. \u201cI was not party to any violent actions around the Venezuelan Embassy,\u201d the Grayzone editor said, dismissing the claim as a \u201cmalicious lie.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Transfer of Venezuelan embassy in US to \u2018fake government\u2019 would be an \u2018act of war\u2019 \u2013 Max Blumenthal\n\n\u201cThe opposition members who made up these lies about Max and I know they\u2019re lying, and they are obviously using the government and police as tools to get revenge,\u201d said the brother of the Grayzone contributor Alex Rubinstein, Ben. Back then, he was also briefly arrested on phony charges after participating in an attempt to deliver food and sanitary supplies to besieged activists.\n\nJust look at this insane photo: \"USA v. Max Blumenthal\"\n\n\n\nThis what authoritarian regimes do\u2014and the US government is doing it here at home, to persecute and silence a journalist for his factual reporting on the crimes of Venezuelan coup-mongers it supportshttps://t.co/KGMwoq6BMupic.twitter.com/qrsnDMzxQg \u2014 Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 28, 2019\n\nIt remains unclear why the arrest warrant against Blumenthal was brought back to life so many months later, especially since the request for the warrant had initially been rejected, according to an individual familiar with the case. Blumenthal suggested it is \u201cpart of a campaign of political persecution designed to silence me and the The Grayzone for our factual journalism.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Anti-coup activists charged with \u2018interfering\u2019 in US raid on Venezuelan embassy\n\nLike this story?
