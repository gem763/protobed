Some have zapped WeChat out of their phones. Others have abandoned e-wallets developed by Chinese conglomerates like Alibaba and Tencent. They disable location tracking on their smartphones.\n\nProtesters resist visual surveillance and facial recognition by using formations of open umbrellas aimed at cameras and helicopters. In August, some sawed down 20 \u201csmart\u201d lampposts in the city that they believed contained hardware for surveillance technology.\n\nHongkongers who do need to cross the border into Shenzhen for work use burner phones, though many have simply stopped entering mainland China. As protests take place in various districts in the city every few days, anonymity has become a matter of paramount importance.\n\nAdopting some elements of black bloc tactics, the city\u2019s blackshirt protesters dress identically\u2014black shirt, black pants, black shoes, gas mask, hard hat. Some clutch umbrellas. Many have saline solution to rinse out eyes when tear gas or pepper spray hits. A rare few have power packs and functioning display screens on their backs. Uniform dress is meant to inspire kinship, but more importantly to make it difficult to identify individuals who participate in street clashes or acts of destruction.\n\nOn Friday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam invoked a colonial-era law to give herself emergency powers. Her first edict was to ban face masks, which protesters use to obscure their faces as well as prevent inhalation of tear gas fired by police\u2014now a weekly occurrence across the city. Obscuring one\u2019s face in public will carry a jail term of one year and a fine of HKD 25,000 ($3,190).\n\nAt a press conference, Lam claimed she was not, in fact, declaring a state of emergency. She said, \u201cWe must prevent Hong Kong and prevent students from taking things into their own hands, and recover Hong Kong\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nYounger protesters hit the streets every weekend precisely because they have their eyes on the future. If things progress as they have been, with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s influence seeping into every facet of the city gradually, over years, Hongkongers believe their freedoms\u2014of assembly, of speech, of expression, of the press, and more\u2014will be stripped away.\n\nLam\u2019s ban on face masks will apply to all public gatherings. A pro-establishment lawmaker, Michael Tien, who refused to endorse Lam\u2019s move, said, \u201cNow it\u2019s all stick and no carrot.\u201d Tien had been urging Lam\u2019s administration to offer some concessions to Hongkongers, first by launching an inquiry into the police\u2019s use of force.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Tanya Chan, who leads the pan-democratic bloc, said the mask ban is an excuse for Lam to invoke other emergency powers. These include authorizing arrests, shutting down telecommunications, censoring media, seizing property, and changing or enacting laws if the city falls into an emergency state.\n\nBeyond the mask ban, pro-Beijing legislators in the city have toyed with the idea of pushing for a curfew.\n\nPresciently, in 2016, Edward Leung, a jailed activist whose slogan \u201cliberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d has become a rallying cry for Hongkongers in the past four months, pointed out that shortly after Ukraine passed legislation banning masks in 2014, the Euromaidan Revolution broke out.\n\nInside Beijing\u2019s Toolbox to Crush Hong Kong\n\nAs word spread that Lam\u2019s law will go into effect at midnight, thousands of people left work during lunch time in the central business district\u2014not far from the government headquarters\u2014to clog the streets. They chanted, \u201cHongkongers, resist!\u201d A few had gas masks with them, but most wore simple surgical masks\u2014in black, to match the color adopted by the protesters who face off with riot police every weekend. Buses, trucks, and cars blocked roads. By nightfall, when subway staff attempted to shutter a station\u2019s exit, protesters\u2014younger ones in gas masks and hard hats\u2014pushed the roller gate back up and smashed its controls.\n\nBy nightfall, students still in their school uniforms had formed human chains to pass supplies to hundreds of frontline protesters who had congregated near government buildings. Crowds continued to gather in neighborhoods across the city, with activists and frontline protesters and Hongkongers still in their attire from a day at the office jamming roads together.", "description": "Anthony Kwan/GettyHONG KONG\u2014Four months into a citywide uprising, Hong Kong residents have become extremely mindful about leaving digital trails that are sent back to mainland China.
