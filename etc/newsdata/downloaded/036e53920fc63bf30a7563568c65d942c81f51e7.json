It is insane that he can\u2019t seem to acknowledge that these weren\u2019t run-of-the-mill consensual affairs with women who are now trying to cover up their guilt. They were with women who were in a position of less power, less money, less agency than he had within the same organization where he had all the power, all the money, all the agency. It would have been one thing if they could in no way be impacted by him professionally, then he could maybe claim it was consensual and stick to that story all he wants. But as with [Harvey] Weinstein allegedly going after women who wanted to work for Miramax or get parts in a film, Lauer knew he had the upper hand in terms of the power dynamic when it came to these women and their futures at NBC, and to now attempt to play ignorant about that fact is beyond stupid, it\u2019s infuriating, insulting and deeply disappointing to those who thought maybe he\u2019d have learned something.\u201d\n\nMatt Lauer | Paul Drinkwater/NBC/Getty More\n\n\u201cAnd if you think he wasn\u2019t consciously exploiting that factor, in a predatory fashion, ask yourself why the women coming forward were all junior to him and all within NBC News,\u201d the source adds. \u201cThis is one of the most powerful, dynamic, wealthiest men in NYC media circles, and there\u2019s not an aspiring actress, musician, lawyer, model, in the bunch. He knew what to make his prey, and he stuck to it.\u201d\n\nThe source also criticizes the \u201coffensive and grotesque\u201d wording of Lauer\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cHe is deliberately trying to provoke and shock, and then he is turning around and being harassing and threatening. It\u2019s just a hugely disappointing response to those who once cared about him \u2014 it\u2019s like he\u2019s fully showing his true colors now, and many people who thought he was maybe using all this time away holed up in the Hamptons to reflect and come to terms with his role in all of this now think that maybe he\u2019s actually a far bigger monster than they ever realized,\u201d adds the source, noting how Lauer retreated to the Hamptons following his firing from NBC two years ago.", "description": "Matt Lauer's Former Friends: He\u2019s a 'Bigger Monster Than They Realized'", "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9_90vO_caEcb0x_zi9Rmsw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/aa8b26eb18ce86d75e785bff24fd9a9d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
