Trump. The rapper asked his audience, \"Do you f*ck with Donald Trump,\" but the concert goer did not express dissatisfaction withe the president. YG called the fan on stage, and demanded that he say, \"f*ck Trump.\" The boy refused, and YG promptly kicked him out of the concert.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if I want to shake your hand yet. Listen, I spotted you out in the crowd. I asked you if you f**k with Donald Trump, you said you don\u2019t know,\" YG asked after the fan stepped on stage. \"So, since you don't know, I need you to make up your mind tonight.\"\n\nThe boy, going along with the onstage appearance, looked confused. The rapper asked him to hurl the obscenity at Trump, and then he refused and shook his head.\n\n\"No you won\u2019t?...Get him off the stage...He a Donald Trump supporter. Get his a** outta here,\" the artist with albums such as The Real 4Fingaz, Just Re'd Up, Just Re'd Up 2, 4 Hunnid Degreez, and 4Real 4Real said to applause.\n\nYG really kicked em out ?? pic.twitter.com/yCIMTIWIGk \u2014 DatPiff (@DatPiff) October 27, 2019\n\nOn Monday morning, the White House issued a statement to Fox News blasting the stunt as \"another example of the tolerant left.\"\n\nCourtesy of USA Today, here are examples of YG's previous animosity towards the commander-in-chief.", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:17:52PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/327/30644f09-eee9-4d6e-8d7e-20a683fd4c77.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
