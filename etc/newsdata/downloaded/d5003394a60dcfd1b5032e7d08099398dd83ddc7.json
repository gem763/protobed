They Just Can\u2019t Decide How.", "language": "en", "text": "MANCHESTER, England\u2014 Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit problem was laid out this week in a dimly lighted comedy club in this northern English city.\n\nAs the British prime minister prepares to present a revised divorce proposal to the European Union in coming days, more than a hundred people gathered in a red-brick room decorated with a photo of Margaret Thatcher to hear and cheer Conservative lawmakers who are adamant the U.K. should leave the bloc at the end of this month without a deal.\n\n\u201cI want nothing more than to see the sun rise on Nov. 1 on a free country,\u201d said Conservative lawmaker Mark Francois, to loud applause.\n\nJohn Redwood, a Conservative lawmaker who has campaigned against the EU since 1975, said people in the U.K. don\u2019t want to be \u201cslaves\u201d to the bloc\u2019s rules. Both sounded coy about backing any agreement, even one renegotiated by Mr. Johnson, to smooth the U.K.\u2019s split with its largest trading partner.\n\nThe event on the fringes of the Conservative Party conference is a reminder of the history of anti-EU sentiment in the party. It was organized by the Bruges Group, a think tank formed in the months after a 1988 speech by Mrs. Thatcher in the Belgian city in which she warned of a European \u201csuperstate.\u201d It also carries a message for the future: Even if Mr. Johnson secures a deal with the EU, he faces a struggle to get lawmakers to back it.\n\nThe people in the room are ostensibly allies of Mr. Johnson, who has staked his political fortunes on delivering Brexit by the end of October. But many of them are likely to vote against any new deal the prime minister brings back from Brussels. Meanwhile, opponents of Mr. Johnson in Parliament, where his government is in a minority, have closed off the alternative: a British exit without a deal.\n\nAt the annual gathering, members of Parliament are broadly united behind Mr. Johnson\u2019s desire to get the U.K. out of the EU.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31.

The latter group comprises around 20 Conservative lawmakers who call themselves \u201cthe Spartans.\u201d\n\nThis divide has ruptured the party. Last month, 21 lawmakers were expelled for voting in favor of a law that forces the prime minister to ask for a Brexit extension beyond Oct. 31 if a deal with the EU isn\u2019t sealed by Oct. 19.\n\nThe split has been visible at the party\u2019s annual get together, where the rival factions have jostled for attention at a host of events for activists from across the country. At the comedy club, Conservative activists booed when the names of some of the 21 rebels were mentioned.\n\nMr. Francois, who has repeatedly rejected a Brexit deal, vowed to continue in his quest for a complete rupture with the EU, his voice cracking as he quoted poetry from Robert Frost:\n\nSome in Britain are sounding alarms on the potential consequences of the U.K. crashing out of the EU without a deal. WSJ\u2019s Saabira Chaudhuri takes a look at what a no-deal Brexit could look like for businesses, the economy and consumers.\n\n\u201cThe woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep.\u201d\n\nSome of the rebels thrown out by Mr. Johnson still turned up to the conference to make their case that an abrupt split with the EU without a deal to smooth the U.K.\u2019s exit would be economically damaging and politically perilous. \u201cThe worst outcome for us is leaving without a deal,\u201d said David Gauke, former justice secretary and one of those ejected from the parliamentary party, at an event Tuesday.\n\nMr. Gauke said he thinks an extension is inevitable as Parliament won\u2019t permit Mr. Johnson to pursue a no-deal split. \u201cI think that is right and has been right for some time,\u201d he said.\n\nHealing the party\u2019s fissure and delivering Brexit will be complicated and perhaps impossible, analysts say. Mr. Johnson must present a proposal that is different enough from Mrs. May\u2019s to persuade as many as possible of his party\u2019s Spartans to vote for it, while not veering so far away from her deal that the EU rejects it out of hand.\n\nSo far, Mr. Johnson\u2019s plan centers on reducing border checks between Northern Ireland, which is in the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, a separate EU member state. This would be done by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the EU on certain rules, such as veterinary checks on animals, while implementing a system of customs checks away from the border, officials say. The aim is to respect a peace accord on the island of Ireland, while reimposing a border.\n\nSome attending the conference believe Mr. Johnson might be able to pull it off. His ability to persuade is his \u201cparticular value added,\u201d said Richard Graham, a Conservative lawmaker. The fact that Mr. Johnson has packed his government with euroskeptics has thinned the rebel ranks. Also, the Conservative\u2019s allies in Parliament, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, have toned down their opposition to a compromise deal, citing the damage the local economy could face if a physical border were suddenly put in place. \u201cA deal is possible,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nBut others are skeptical, and question whether the U.K. should pursue a deal based on Mrs. May\u2019s withdrawal plan at all. In Brussels, meanwhile, officials say they have seen nothing yet from the U.K. that would form the basis of any new deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance of getting a deal, not one that would be acceptable to Parliament, probably not acceptable to the public either,\u201d said Ewen Sinclair, deputy chairman of a local Conservative association in Herefordshire, western England. \u201cI don\u2019t see no deal as the catastrophe it\u2019s been painted.\u201d\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "description": "Boris Johnson has staked his political fortunes on delivering Brexit by the end of October, but he lacks a majority in Parliament.
