Approval processes are taking too long,\" said Homann.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bundesnetzagentur, that holds the licensing auctions for new capacity, reported the latest auction was undersubscribed again, with 187 MW out of 500 MW awarded.\n\nThis happened despite a higher average price of 6.2 cents/kilowatt hour compared with the wholesale market's benchmark price of around 5 cents.\n\nWhile renewables overall have reached 41% of the power mix after 20 years of subsidised growth, onshore wind contributes 18% and offshore wind only 4% of the total, with the remainder from water, solar, biomass and waste.\n\nSpeakers at the conference said that bickering between states and citizen participation were part of Germany's federal and regional consensus-style politics. But this was threatening progress while wind technologies aged fast.\n\nHomann also commented on the agency's role in bringing about the long-term closure of German coal fired power plants after a draft law seen by Reuters last Thursday set out first scenarios for implementation.\n\nThe Bundesnetzagentur will have to organize the auctions for phasing out hard coal-fired plants and identify priorities for possible enforced shut-downs.\n\n\"This involves not just identifying when plants started production but also what retrofit measures (installing new or modified parts) were taken in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"This will lead to some controversial talks with the companies,\" he added.\n\n(Reporting by Vera Eckert, editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "description": "MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany's energy regulator supports an overhaul of legal procedures and red tape by the economy ministry to reverse a sharp fall in wind turbine constructions that threatens to throw the country's energy transformation off course.", "authors": ["Vera Eckert"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
