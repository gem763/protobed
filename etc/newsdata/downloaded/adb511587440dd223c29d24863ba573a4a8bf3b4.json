The company reported in its third-quarter earnings that Stranger Things\u2019 third season is \u201cthe most watched season to date,\u201d with \u201c64 million member households\u201d watching it within the first month of its release.\n\nNetflix isn\u2019t exactly forthcoming about how it collects those numbers. In the past, the company has said that it counts one view for a film such as Bird Box when a Netflix viewer\u2019s account completes at least 70 percent of the film. The logical leap would be to assume that Netflix counts a season being watched as one account completing at least 70 percent of every episode that season. That would be approximately 5.6 episodes worth of Stranger Things\u2019 8-episode third season.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not how Netflix counts views for seasons of a show. A footnote in Netflix\u2019s fourth quarter earnings letter to shareholders in 2018 states that for each series, \u201cdue to their highly variable length, we count a viewer if they substantially complete at least one episode (70 percent).\u201d That\u2019s 70 percent of one episode, not 70 percent of an entire season. The number was first used to talk about Elite, a Spanish teen drama that has become a phenomenon on sites like Tumblr. Netflix reported that 20 million accounts watched the show\u2019s first season in four weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s 70 percent of one episode, not 70 percent of an entire season\n\nSince then, Netflix has used this methodology for all of its reported numbers, a Netflix representative confirmed to The Verge. Since Netflix doesn\u2019t work with third-party companies like Nielsen to confirm those numbers, it\u2019s difficult to say just how accurate they are. Nielsen did its own independent study when Stranger Things\u2019 third season first debuted, and found that 26.4 million unique viewers in the United States watched the show within its first three days. Netflix\u2019s own report discovered that more than 40 million people watched the show within its first four days globally. To be fair, Nielsen\u2019s numbers don\u2019t take into account mobile, tablet, or laptop viewing.\n\nWhat\u2019s obvious from both sets of numbers is that Stranger Things is an obvious hit for Netflix. What\u2019s interesting about Netflix\u2019s reported numbers is which shows and films it decides to disclose viewership results for, and which ones it doesn\u2019t. Netflix has hundreds of original shows and films, but only discloses numbers for a select few. The numbers the company discloses are always positive, shedding a light on its major successes. While traditional broadcast networks also spotlight their top performing shows, Nielsen provides an unfiltered look at how every show is performing. Box office numbers do the same thing for films. Netflix doesn\u2019t have that sort of oversight.\n\nOf course Netflix wants to show that its films and TV shows are being watched around the world, but it\u2019s more important than ever right now. Disney and Apple are entering the streaming market in less than a month, and are expected to take some attention away from Netflix. Stranger Things is considered a show that will bring in and retain subscribers, so it\u2019s a good flag to wave. The urgency is also probably why Netflix signed a massive overall deal with Stranger Things showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer, who will produce more series and films for Netflix.\n\nNetflix only released numbers for a few other shows this quarter: La Casa de Papel, Sintonia, The Naked Director, and Sacred Games. They help demonstrate the attention Netflix wants to pay to its global market, but numbers for five shows isn\u2019t enough to help us see whether Netflix\u2019s original content is performing well, period. How many people are watching full seasons of shows is a question, yes, but also: how many people are watching Netflix\u2019s original shows in general?", "description": "There\u2019s no question that Stranger Things is one of Netflix\u2019s most popular shows, but we have to question whether it\u2019s as record-breaking as Netflix claims.
