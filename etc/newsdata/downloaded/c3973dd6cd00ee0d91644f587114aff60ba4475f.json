To date, 14 crashes and five injuries have reportedly been linked to the alleged phantom braking issue, which potentially affects 554,000 Rogues from 2017 and 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Center for Auto Safety petitioned for the probe in March and said that Nissan should recall the vehicles. The automaker has previously offered a software update aimed at improving the system\u2019s performance, after an internal investigation and discussions with NHTSA, and also recalled the vehicle in Canada after determining that some fixed objects, including overhead signs, could initiate a false response.\n\nVIDEO: UNOCCUPIED VEHICLE GHOST RIDES ACROSS HIGHWAY AND WRECKS\n\nAlong with the Rogue, AEB is standard on most of Nissan\u2019s U.S. lineup, including the Pathfinder, Altima and Sentra. No other models currently fall under the investigation, which will determine if further action is necessary.", "description": "Phantom braking events reported.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
