This year there was a panel of four women, two of them of colour. That\u2019s never happened. It\u2019s become more woke.\u2019\n\nBut Jonathan Taylor, below right, awards chairman from 2001 to 2015, hit back: \u2018Rubbish! This year\u2019s shortlist did not have a single white Anglo Saxon man \u2013 what about that for discrimination?\u2019\n\nBernardine also told me she made an altar of African sculptures and prayed to it in the hope of winning, saying: \u2018It was about training my mind to expect to get it. They announced my name and deep-down inside, I thought, \u201cYep!\u201d \u2019\n\n\u2018There were only a couple of black women before me who were shortlisted,\u2019 Bernardine Evaristo, left, told me after she shared the \u00a350,000 prize for fiction with Margaret Atwood (pictured right: Jonathan Taylor)\n\nKate Moss can make you a supermodel \u2013 but only, it seems, if you\u2019re one of her pals\u2019 children. Though she was plucked from obscurity as a Croydon schoolgirl, Kate doesn\u2019t feel the need to give other aspiring stars the same chance. In fact, connections appear to matter more than looks.\n\nKate\u2019s model agency is made up of 17 models \u2013 five are children of friends and one is her own daughter Lila.\n\nHer other proteges include Keith Richards\u2019 granddaughter Ella, Wolf Gillespie, son of Primal Scream\u2019s Bobby Gillespie, and Stella Jones, daughter of Clash guitarist Mick Jones. But don\u2019t expect Kate to apologise for excluding anyone outside the Mossy Posse. Her agency said: \u2018The small roster is a collective of family and long-time friends with a chosen few welcomed into the fold \u2013 only if their vibe is right.\u2019\n\nGood job Kate wasn\u2019t in charge when the likes of Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell were starting out...\n\nNow Gwynnie poo-poos the humble loo roll\n\nGwyneth once said she had the \u2018butt of a 22-year-old stripper\u2019.\n\nI imagine Gwyneth Paltrow refuses to use anything less than bleach-free, macrobiotic, vegan, eco-friendly gold-leaf paper on her derriere when she visits the loo at home.\n\nBut if she\u2019s forced to leave the house she uses an \u00a311 \u2018Spruce\u2019 spray to make regular old public loo roll more bearable.\n\nGwynnie, right, advises her Goop customers to keep a bottle of Spruce and use it to \u2018transform regular toilet paper into a more cleansing, moisturising wet wipe\u2019.\n\nThe 47-year-old adds: \u2018Just spray your toilet paper then spray a little in the air.\u2019\n\nGwyneth once said she had the \u2018butt of a 22-year-old stripper\u2019. No wonder it needs such careful attention.\n\nToo much information\n\nTV presenter Anna Richardson \u2013 girlfriend of comedian Sue Perkins \u2013 went way over the top as we were discussing beauty treatments last week.\n\nAnna, below, told me she\u2019d had \u2018lots of Botox\u2019, but added she would never \u2018have my lips done\u2019 because it might affect intimate moments.\n\nSpare me the details, Anna!", "description": "TALK OF THE TOWN: Bernardine Evaristo said this year's panel of four women, two of them of colour, was a sign it has become 'more woke'.
