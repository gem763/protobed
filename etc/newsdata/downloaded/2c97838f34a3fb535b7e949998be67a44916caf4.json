Four were compromised, but they do not belong to presidential campaigns or government officials, according to the tech giant.\n\nMicrosoft said it notified the customers attacked and has worked with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them. It declined to disclose the names of the account holders.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, Phosphorus hackers tried to figure out how to reset passwords or otherwise trigger account recovery features to take over accounts. In some instances, Microsoft found that the group gathered phone numbers belonging to its targets to try to authenticate password resets.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nAD", "description": "The software giant has detected a campaign linked to the Iranian government attempted to breach email addresses belonging to U.S. presidential campaigns, government officials and journalists.", "authors": ["Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cHNbuHhC8KIBGXxzZMWk0x3ZLWI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GWHLSITGFII6PFFLLMPQ75CZ34.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
