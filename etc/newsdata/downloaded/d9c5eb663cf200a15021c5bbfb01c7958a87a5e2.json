If that statistic sounds high, and if you assume it\u2019s because 100 per cent of Quebec motorists drive on winter tires by law, well \u2014 nope, that\u2019s not it.\n\nQuebec\u2019s made snow tires mandatory since 2008, so it\u2019s got nothing to do with the major jumps in winter tires use nearly every province has registered in the past four years, as broken down here by the Tire and Rubber Association of Canada (TRAC).\n\nIn British Columbia, 64 per cent of drivers now use winter tires, up from just 38 percent in 2014. Moving across the country, those numbers are:\n\nAlberta: 70% (up from 45% in 2014)\n\nSaskatchewan and Manitoba: 60% (up from 39% in 2014)\n\nOntario: 69% (up from 56% in 2014)\n\nQuebec: 100%\n\nMaritimes: 94% (up from 73% in 2014)\n\nCanada: 76% (up from 58% in 2014)\n\nIs the snowflake \u2014 fake?\n\nSo clearly, Canadians want winter tires. And if we had to bet, the sidewall snowflake symbol \u2013 the 3PMSF, as the industry calls this pictogram, born in North America two decades ago \u2013 is likely helping them separate all-season or all-weather tires from the winter rubber they really want, tires that\u2019ll stick when the temperature drops below 7\u00b0C \u2014 or much, much colder.\n\nIt\u2019s -30\u00b0C that morning? It shouldn\u2019t be a problem for your winter tires. In fact, \u201cinstead of thinking of winter tires only as \u2018snow tires\u2019, you may want to start thinking of them as \u2018cold-weather tires,\u2019\u201d TRAC suggests. Okay, gotcha.\n\nBut that alpine symbol tells you only about a minimum. Precisely, it guarantees these winter tires\u2019 traction is at least 10-per-cent superior compared to all-season tires when put through the Transport-Canada-approved ASTM F1805 test. (\u201cASTM\u201d stands for \u201cAmerican Standard Test Method.\u201d)\n\nYou read that right: only 10 per cent better traction.\n\nThe symbol says nothing about superior performance in low temperatures, notes Sylvain L\u00e9gar\u00e9, automotive expert at CAA-Quebec. In fact, some all-season truck tires with aggressive treads can wear the Three-Peak Mountain Snowflake symbol even if their compound will not keep cold-weather tires\u2019 flexibility when the mercury drops.\n\nBeside, this test is conducted on medium-packed-snow surfaces, and only while accelerating in a straight line. Nothing, again, is said or tested or established or measured about accelerating on ice \u2013 more common in cities \u2013 or on that 80cm of fluffy snow that fell over Calgary 10 days ago.\n\nWhat really interests us in winter-y conditions is the braking aptitudes, right? Sadly, no industry or government test measures stopping distances, on snow or on ice. Same thing for tires while veering or skidding.\n\nBut have patience: A new testing procedure is under development, part of an effort to create an ISO standard that will measure a tire\u2019s grip on an icy surface, says Barry Yutronkie, Director of Operations for TRAC.\n\n\u201cOnce a standard is created (perhaps in a few years\u2019 time) industry will have the tool by which a common benchmark can be established,\u201d says Yutronkie. \u201cBut right now, it is a little premature to know the outcome. Perhaps this will evolve into a marking on the tire or some other method to identify the ice capability of tire.\u201d\n\nThe good new (and the bad news)\n\nThe good news: You\u2019re not condemned to buy crappy winter tires. Manufacturers are moving beyond those performance minimums via new compounds, treads and avant-garde technologies like \u201cmicrobites\u201d \u2014 engineered from crushed walnut shells.\n\n\u201cMany tires in the market today achieve levels approaching 130 per cent [better than all-season] so there can be quite a range between tires that meet the minimum and the ones that perform at the higher levels,\u201d explains Yutronkie.\n\nThe bad news: You\u2019ll have to work harder than just walking into any big-box store a few hours before a snowstorm to hastily choose what you think is the best quality-priced winter tires.\n\n(We shop for a new car for weeks, even months, comparing models, options, reading reviews \u2014 how come we don\u2019t put half that effort into buying the only thing keeping that well-chosen car on the road?)\n\nYour winter tires can\u2019t do it all\n\nThe best \u201ccold-weather tire\u201d advice we can give you? First off, since a set of four winter rubbers will last you an average 40,000 km (three or four years) make the effort to visit a couple of tire stores. (Also, yes, you want four snow tires, not only two. Otherwise, you\u2019ll affect your vehicle\u2019s stability and, in the long run, the whole integrity of your vehicle\u2019s traction systems.)\n\nShop way before arrives the \u201crealistic date\u201d for your city and find a few models that will suit your needs. Some criteria to consider, suggests (former ice racer) Sylvain L\u00e9gar\u00e9 of CAA-Quebec:\n\nWhat do you drive? A small car, a performance car, an intermediate SUV, a giant pickup?\n\nWhere do you drive? In cities, on highway, in rural county \u2014 all of the above?\n\nHow do you drive, and on what? Snow? Packed snow? Ice? Black ice? Do you tow?\n\nHow many kilometers do you \u201cwinter-drive\u201d on average?\n\nHow much do you want to pay?\n\nDrop from your shopping list any models that don\u2019t meet any of your criteria, recommends L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and then prioritize the rest of your tire wants and needs. Because sadly, \u201cyour winter tires can\u2019t do it all,\u201d says L\u00e9gar\u00e9. Choose the longer-lasting budget-minded tires and you may sacrifice the comfort of the quieter ones.\n\nThinking of studded tires? L\u00e9gar\u00e9 notes the tech on those has improved so much recently, some of those crampons can even retract until needed. (Please remember some condo parking garages and municipalites ban them, though, and that in Quebec, they\u2019re allowed only from October 15 to May 1.)\n\nSo, what is the best tire?\n\nWhat a question. As when asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the best car?\u201d there\u2019s no easy answer. To start, though, Consumer Reports\u2018 top five recommendations for cars specifically are the:\n\nCooper Discoverer True North (score of 70)\n\nHankook Winter i*Cept iZ2 (70)\n\nContinental Winter Contact SI (69)\n\nMichelin X-Ice XI3 (68)\n\nNokian Hakkapeliita R3 (68)\n\nThe magazine also offers subscribers recommended winter tires for trucks and recommended performance vehicle winter/snow tires. Note those recommendations all have a flaw, though: Despite being \u201cExcellent\u201d to \u201cGood\u201d in many aspects (handling, snow traction, ride comfort and noise) all do \u201cPoor\u201d or at best \u201cFair\u201d in wet braking and dry braking.\n\nIce, ice, baby\n\nYou have to know Consumer Reports, based in Connecticut, is testing winter tires in a local indoor ice skating ring. \u201cWe test the braking from 10 mph (16 km/h) and no, we never crashed a car \u2014 although we sometimes came very close,\u201d Eugene Petersen, Consumer Reports\u2019 tire program manager, told us.\n\nSylvain L\u00e9gar\u00e9 doesn\u2019t believe too much in this \u201cindoor\u201d ice testing. \u201cIf you want my personal advice, the ice of a skating rink is never as slippery as black ice or wet ice. If you play hockey, you know you can walk on ice without falling. Try this after an ice storm on your city\u2019s streets!\u201d\n\nSo what does L\u00e9gar\u00e9 in all his ice racing driver experience recommend for winter tires? \u201cThe Pirelli Ice Zero FR, the Nokian Hakkapeliitta, the Michelin X-Ice and the Toyo GSi-6 with its crushed walnut shells.\u201d (We weren\u2019t joking about the walnut tech.)\n\nBetter yet, what does L\u00e9gar\u00e9 stick on the rims of his own daily driver? The highest-end studded winter tires he can find.
