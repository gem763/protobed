We should be ready for every scenario,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers in Britain, meeting on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years, voted to demand that Prime Minister Boris Johnson delay Brexit while they further consider a divorce agreement agreed with the EU last week.\n\nThe government now wants parliament to approve an accompanying package of legislation that needs ratifying for Brexit to take effect.\n\nThe EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned that even if a Brexit withdrawal agreement is ratified and comes into force, it would just be the start of even longer negotiations to decide the future EU-UK relationship.\n\n\"We will have to renegotiate for one year, two years, three years, maybe more in some areas, to rebuild all that will have been pulled apart by the desire of those backing Brexit,\" he said.\n\nBarnier said rules would have to be established to address the risk of environmental, tax and labour \"dumping\", and in terms of cooperation for education exchanges, police, defence and foreign policy.", "description": "The EU said Tuesday it believes it has done \"all in our power\" to ensure an orderly Brexit and that a new divorce deal now hangs on the approval of British MPs before any European ratification.  \"We need now to watch events in Westminster very closely,\" Juncker said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MGJdmkYL8BEx470pXXoPrQ--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/393bb1014f7a9ca048a215270331fa3b6626f88e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
