Taxpayers paid for the entourage\u2019s stay, since it was official business.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s aides on Tuesday said Mr. Trump suggested, though didn\u2019t order, the Pence team set up at Doonbeg, only to later issue a statement accepting full responsibility for the decision to stay there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suggest anything,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, describing his general practice.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s grandfather grew up in the Doonbeg area, before immigrating to the U.S. The vice president and family members dined at a Doonbeg pub owned by a distant cousin late Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHis family has lived there for many decades,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe knew I had this terrific place in Ireland, in Doonbeg.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also said he didn\u2019t urge Attorney General William Barr to book his family Christmas party at the Trump hotel in downtown D.C., as critics worry the president is flaunting his properties to profit from the presidency.\n\n\u201cPeople like my product, what can I tell you?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI guess they say they want to stay at a place that\u2019s better than someplace else.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
