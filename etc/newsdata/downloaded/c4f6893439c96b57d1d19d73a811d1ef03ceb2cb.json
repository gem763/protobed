In May, an ad for the razor company Gillette that featured a dad teaching his transgender son to shave for the first time went viral.\n\nThomas Page McBee, 38, a writer who has studied masculinity and an amateur boxer who became the first transgender man to fight in New York City's iconic Madison Square Garden, said he feels Manuel's story shows that there are \"many ways to be a man.\"\n\n\"This is one example where you have an iconic company like Everlast saying that Pat's masculinity is valid,\" he said. \"I see all of these campaigns as signs of change, and I personally welcome it.\"\n\nvia Everlast\n\nStill, having Manuel as the face of Everlast is \"certainly beneficial way beyond the trans community,\" McBee said.\n\n\"Pat is just an incredibly talented athlete who had to do something that I don't think most athletes can even fathom,\" he said. \"And really re-train your body ... I know for me my center of balance shifted when I transitioned \u2026 in boxing that center of balance is so important.\"\n\nThat level of athleticism is \"inspiring to everybody,\" he added.\n\n\"He is able to be both a compelling and thoughtful person and able to dominate in the sport that's about aggression,\" McBee said.", "description": "Patricio Manuel became the new face of the iconic boxing brand Everlast in a new campaign, and shared how he had to", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/patricio-manuel-01-ht-jef-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
