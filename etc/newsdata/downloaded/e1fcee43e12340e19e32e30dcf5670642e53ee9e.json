But I think you have to just put in the extra effort,\u201d said Crystal Dunn, a top player on her championship-defending Courage as well as the national team.\n\nDunn said she hopes the NWSL schedule adapts to avoid \u201cdisruptive\u201d years punctuated by World Cup or Olympic competition.\n\n\u201cWe are pulled away, we\u2019re told to come back, you know, we\u2019re yanked in a lot of different directions,\u201d Dunn told reporters.\n\nThe NWSL season runs for roughly half the year, with 24 regular season games, plus possible post-season action for some of the top performing squads.\n\nSome players on the national squad missed large chunks of club team action this year to train for and compete in the World Cup, with little down time before returning.\n\n\u201cI think the only way to really do it is to compartimentalize \u2013 when you\u2019re there, you\u2019re there; when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re here,\u201d said Alyssa Naeher, the starting goalie for the U.S. women\u2019s national team and the Chicago Red Stars.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing during a tournament year is the mental side of things,\u201d said Red Stars midfielder Julie Ertz, who competed in both the 2015 and 2019 World Cups.\n\nAt a press conference on Saturday, the coaches for the Courage and Red Stars urged for more to be done about the long absences by some players in World Cup years.\n\nChicago coach Rory Dames, who emphatically praised his team members\u2019 commitment to the club, raised concern about the impact on the league.\n\n\u201cWhen the international players come over here they\u2019re putting their bodies on the line,\u201d said Dames. \u201cAnd if the perception is not all U.S. players have to do that, it\u2019s going to be tough to either keep the best ones here or bring other ones in.\u201d\n\nNWSL President Amanda Duffy told Reuters she felt the week-long hiatus during the tournament this year was adequate, but that she was open to a conversation for additional time off in the future.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be challenging physically, emotionally for players, it also creates an opportunity for new players,\u201d said Duffy.", "description": "From training to competition, media events and exhibition matches, balancing a spot on a championship-caliber club soccer team and on the most highly decorated women's national squad in World Cup history can be downright exhausting.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445389183&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q064", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
