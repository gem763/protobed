A bond with negative convexity operates a different way: When interest rates fall, the price of the bond tends to rise less than other bonds with similar maturities. And when rates rise, the price of the bond tends to fall more than other bonds with similar maturities.\n\nThat\u2019s weird. Why would a bond behave that way?\n\nWhen rates fall, a homeowner who took out a fixed-rate mortgage will likely try to refinance to lock in lower monthly payments. (And indeed, that\u2019s what we have seen over the summer.) That is good news for the borrower. But it is a riskier game for investors in mortgage-backed securities because they are holding on to something that is likely to be paid off faster than they initially bet.\n\nBecause the duration of mortgage-backed securities is sensitive to changes in interest rates, the securities have negative convexity. When interest rates fall, the price of mortgage-backed securities rises less than other bonds with similar maturities, since the amount of time investors expect to elapse between when the security was issued and when it matures has shortened.\n\nWhy Some Investors are Buying High Big declines in interest rates can intensify institutional investors\u2019 demand for bonds. An insurer expects to pay out claims for many years. In order to meet those obligations, it must hold assets that earn income, balancing its long-term liabilities. Falling interest rates increase the value of bonds. As rates fall to 2%, the value of a 30-year bond paying 4% rises because it is now more attractive to investors. Long-term assets such as holdings of government bonds or mortgage- backed securities But at the same time, falling rates increase the present value of the insurer\u2019s liabilities. Owing someone $1,000 30 years hence is costlier when rates are lower. Sometimes swings in rates change the value of liabilities more. This can force the insurer to buy more long-term assets to patch the gap.

To compensate for that, they would have had to add duration elsewhere. One easy way to do that was by turning to long-dated bonds in the Treasurys market\u2014adding to the wave of buying that pushed yields on the 10-year note increasingly close to its record low in August.\n\nBut how much could that have actually affected the Treasurys market?\n\nA lot, by some analysts\u2019 estimates. My colleague Paul Davies reported that JPMorgan \u2019s Josh Younger, head of U.S. interest rates derivatives strategy, attributed less than half of the decline in 10-year Treasury yields in August to economic reasons. By Mr. Younger\u2019s estimation, without asset managers scrambling to hedge their positions, the 10-year yield might be a quarter-percentage point higher.\n\nBack to mortgage-backed securities. Why would someone invest in them if they have to deal with negative convexity?\n\nThe simple answer: They offer higher yields than Treasurys. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. is around 3.58%, according to Freddie Mac, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond settled Thursday at 1.985%. For some investors, the extra yield they would get is worth the interest-rate risk.\n\nRelated The Market Forces That Propelled a Massive Rally in Long Bonds\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "description": "Analysts trying to make sense of the steep slide in bond yields around the world in August are pointing fingers at many things, including the phenomenon of hedging against negative convexity in the mortgage market.", "authors": ["Akane Otani", "Akane.Otani Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103036/social"}
