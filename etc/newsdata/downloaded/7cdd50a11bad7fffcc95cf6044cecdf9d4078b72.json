I had a meal with my closest friends and then we went out. On the surface it was a lot of fun but in reality it stung like an unpleasant bee.\n\nWhile I only invited my closest friends for the meal, I invited a wider, varied group of friends for drinks afterwards. I didn\u2019t want to make a big thing of it, so I invited the people I really wanted.\n\nThought of the day This is where I came from. I passed this way. This should not be shameful Or hard to say. From the Ideal, by James Fenton (British poet, born 1949)\n\nMany said: \u2018Yes, ok, fine\u2019 \u2014 though a few said they couldn\u2019t make it in spite of the advance notice. Then one by one, all the people I\u2019d expected messaged with apologies and excuses the day before. If it had happened just this once I could put it down to bad luck, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nSince I was young I\u2019ve had crappy birthdays, invited people out and then have them not turn up. It\u2019s infuriating.\n\nLast year it was literally just me and my best friend.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s the same people. People come in and out of your life all the time yet behave in the same way. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m disorganised \u2014 I let people know it\u2019s coming up.\n\nObviously, I could look on the bright side and say at least I spent it with my closest friends, but I do count the others as good friends, see them plenty, they\u2019re part of my life.\n\nIt just makes me feel worthless. They don\u2019t care enough to make an effort and flimsy excuses reveal I\u2019m not a priority. It makes me feel like I don\u2019t matter to people, even though I\u2019m in their lives as much as they are in mine.\n\nThe fact that only three people care enough to celebrate with me is gut-wrenching.\n\nI\u2019d love to have a proper birthday one year with a DJ playing cheesy tunes \u2014 but I don\u2019t because, subconsciously, I know no one will turn up and I\u2019d be humiliated.\n\nPart of me wants to have a big rant on Facebook and shame them. Or to cut everyone from my life and start again somewhere else. Another part never wants to celebrate another birthday because I\u2019ve been let down and disappointed so many times over the years.\n\nPart of me thinks that if I died tomorrow, no one would come to my funeral because they had better things to do. Why does this happen? And what should I do about it?\n\nROB\n\nThis week Bel advises a reader who feels hurt by his 'friends' who bailed out on his birthday\n\nPoor old Polonius, the fussy courtier in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet gave his departing son Laertes plenty of good advice, including some words on friendship. They\u2019ll do for you too:\n\nThose friends thou hast, and\n\ntheir adoption tried,\n\nGrapple them to thy soul with\n\nhoops of steel;\n\nBut do not dull the palm with entertainment\n\nOf each new-hatched, unfledged comrade.\n\nIn other words, once you\u2019ve tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them. But don\u2019t waste your time shaking hands with every new, immature friend you meet. Do you see? So you\u2019re wise to rejoice that you did share your birthday with three really good friends.\n\nAt the same time, I can\u2019t blame you for this deep hurt at the casual behaviour of the others. Your sense of being excluded and neglected is (I suspect) just how I\u2019d feel, too.\n\nIn fact, I confess (just between you and me) that I haven\u2019t had a book launch since 1993 because I cannot bear the thought of being disappointed by no-shows.\n\nI absolutely detest people who accept invitations then don\u2019t show or cry off at the last minute with a flimsy excuse. Does that make us both (you still young, me at the other end of life) a bit feeble? Well, so be it. I no longer need to hide my vulnerable humanity.\n\nAh, but perhaps you need to hide it. Whatever you do, never ever show your vulnerability on social media, because it will just rebound and possible destroy you.\n\nI have just read about yet another version of online brutality called \u2018sadfishing\u2019. This is when a young person shares details about personal problems on social media only to be mocked.\n\nThey are sad and vulnerable, \u2018fishing\u2019 for sympathy, only to be met with ridicule that makes them feel even worse. So beware. Never reveal, in sorrow or anger, your neediness online, because it might receive a serious kicking.\n\nI wonder if much of the problem is associated with what I call your generation\u2019s FOCA \u2014 no, not a variety of bread but a fear of committing to arrangements.\n\nMe, I invite people on email and then write things down in a real diary. But when everything is clicked through casually in phone messages there is no reality. It\u2019s a virtual arrangement \u2014 not really existing in the real world and therefore easily broken.\n\nI bet if a friend had arranged a 30th at a smart place and sent real invitations people might have shown up \u2014 because they thought it special.\n\nOf course, they might not. I once gave a very smart drinks party in London, at a lovely venue, to celebrate a big birthday and even though I had to pay for canap\u00e9s in advance, about six or seven people who had accepted just didn\u2019t show.\n\nIt was rude and cost me money as well as feelings. Never again!\n\nHave you ever seen the movie, Little Man Tate? That terrible scene where mother and son have the room ready for his party and nobody shows. What can you do? Get a bit tough. Grow a shell. Realise that new friends do come and go and won\u2019t count until they prove their worth, just as Polonius said.\n\nStick to the oldies but goodies. Cultivate that \u2018surface\u2019 you mention \u2014 and stay cool, leaving no chink for that nasty little bee to find a way through and sting you.\n\nNone of this means you become a nastier person. It just means you learn to protect your soft underbelly from a careless world \u2014 which is always good counsel.\n\nHelp! My daughter's are at war\n\nDear Bel,\n\nMy husband died of cancer more than a year ago. I have two daughters \u2014 one has three children and the other was pregnant while her father was ill. He wasn\u2019t an easy man, I worked hard, we were not perfect, but the family was the one thing he and I both cared about.\n\nMy eldest lives quite near. During my husband\u2019s illness, she fell out with her sister as she believed she should have visited him more often. When my youngest grandchild was born, they continued not to speak. He\u2019s now one and she still hasn\u2019t seen her nephew. Family life has been torn apart. I\u2019ve been racked by illness and most days don\u2019t want to be here.\n\nSome days I just want to forget them for bringing me grief upon grief.\n\nNow I need an operation and just hope I do not come out of hospital.\n\nLINDA\n\nReading about such family conflicts is the worst aspect of my job. Often they\u2019re made worse by hasty, terse texts that can never be recalled.\n\nI wonder if that happened between your daughters? Reading between the lines (and knowing things from your longer letter), I suspect there were family problems before these sad events.\n\nIt sounds as if you were no stranger to conflict over the years, admitting that your late husband was \u2018difficult\u2019. Young people will pick up on these character traits and possibly learn to \u2018communicate\u2019 in similar ways.\n\nDid your daughters squabble a lot when they were young? Being honest about your memories might help you to consider why they are like this now.\n\nWhatever the deeper truths, reading of your despair I feel frustrated by your daughters, especially the elder. You are grateful that she is helpful to you, yet she made your agony over your husband\u2019s illness and death so much worse because of \u2018falling\u2019 out with her sister over a perceived lack of visits. There must be more to this.\n\nBut the question is, how will you go forward with your own life? I feel very sorry for you, ill as you are and caught in the middle.\n\nYou express a wish to be dead, so I urge you to call the Samaritans (116 123 at any time) if this mood threatens to overwhelm you. You can also use email (jo@samaritans.org), if it would help you to write things out.\n\nThen, do you know anyone who could mediate between your daughters: a family friend or relative? Or what about their respective partners? Something has to be done to break this impasse, and in your state of health you cannot be the one to do it. Try to find someone . . . a little job which shouldn\u2019t tax you too much.\n\nI would like that family friend to show each of your daughters a photograph of them together when young and then ask them if they would speak to each other at their mother\u2019s funeral.\n\nWould you, warring ladies? And would you be able to explain to your respective children why they do not know their cousins?\n\nYou, older sister, do you ever wonder what gave you the right to judge your sister?\n\nYou, younger sister, have you ever put your mother before your quarrel and your pride? Enough of this stupidity!\n\n\n\nAnd finally... Why this old gal is still so merry!\n\nWhen you\u2019re getting older, birthdays are like notches on a gun belt . . . another one \u2014 pow! That\u2019s how I\u2019ll feel on Tuesday when I sit in a restaurant in Bath with my family and just one friend this time. Bring on the vodka and wine!\n\nThe quotation I\u2019ve picked this week is about accepting who you are, for better for worse. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t change or shouldn\u2019t try to, because our lives should be a continuous process of evolution. And that\u2019s glorious, even if change often involves pain.\n\nBut it does mean that looking back and regretting is a waste of the precious time we have left. Recently, a colleague asked me if I\u2019d have done things differently. No, I said, why would I?\n\nLast week, I went to a party in London to launch a reprint of an elegant glossy book about NOVA Magazine, an unrepeatable publishing icon of 1965-75. It was my first staff job when I was 24.\n\nContact Bel Bel answers readers' questions on emotional and relationship problems each week. Write to Bel Mooney, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT, or email bel.mooney@dailymail.co.uk. A pseudonym will be used if you wish. Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.\n\nSo, there at the bash, were six or seven former colleagues, retired and rather grey now (not me \u2014 I colour my hair!) but all celebrating our shared special \u2018moment\u2019.\n\nThe years just seemed to fall away. I can picture that Nova office as it was; relive the raucous Christmas parties; visualise us all piling over to the Coal Hole (a pub on the Strand) for a \u2018meeting\u2019; hear the relentless clack of our typewriters; remember one lunch I had with the star journalist Irma Kurtz that consisted of four double Bloody Marys each, followed by wine \u2014 and no food.\n\nI remember the flirting, the brainstorming, the helpless laughter, the camaraderie \u2014 and always the cigarette smoke curling up to the ceiling.\n\nNo one judged anyone else; our broadmindedness was a million miles away from today\u2019s culture of offence and disapproval. Why, a vicar once groped my thigh . . . but that\u2019s another story.\n\nThose were the days, my friend, and boy, did we live \u2019em. And that\u2019s why this old gal is still so merry.", "description": "This week Bel advises a reader who feels hurt by his 'friends' who bailed out on his birthday.", "authors": ["Bel Mooney For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19306066-0-image-a-26_1570207012536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
