By July of the same year Justin was engaged to Hailey Baldwin, with the pair tying the knot in September (and for a second time last month).\n\nIn Selena\u2019s latest tune, an emotional ballad Lose You To Love Me, she sings about being \u2018replaced\u2019 in two months \u2018like it was easy\u2019 while also shading this ex for \u2018singing off-key\u2019 in her chorus.\n\nThere is no mention of names, of course, but fans online are putting their armchair detective caps on and believe it to be Biebs. While others think it might be The Weeknd. And others just want to enjoy the tune.\n\nSelena and Justin famously dated for years (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nIn one emotional verse, Selena, 27, sings: \u2018I gave my all and they all know it / You turned me down, and now it\u2019s showing / In two months you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you needed a walk down memory lane, it may be referring to the apparently quick turnaround of his split from Selena and reunion with Hailey \u2013 who he\u2019d dated in the past during one of his breaks from Selena.\n\nKeeping up?\n\nIn another verse, she sings: \u2018Sang off-key in my chorus / \u2018Cause it wasn\u2019t yours / You promised the world / Made her more of a woman /I needed to lose you to find me.\u2019\n\nOoofft, this both stings and makes our own hearts hurt at the same time.\n\nIf you\u2019ll remember, Justin was a featured artist on her songs Can\u2019t Steal Our Love back in 2013 as well as Unfamiliar the following year.\n\nFans thought they\u2019d put two and two together as they took to social media and suggested it was all about Biebs.\n\nshe deserves so much more and this part killed me \u201ein two months you replaced us\u201d this is a goodbye song to Justin and I LOVE IT, it\u2019s finally done #LoseYouToLoveMe pic.twitter.com/L9JVkryi3p \u2014 #LoseYouToLoveMe (@familiarhadid) October 23, 2019\n\nSelena release a song about Justin. This song is about that bieber dude. Releasing same month when Justin got married. She\u2019s closing her chapter with him. She\u2019s finally moving on. Am I really following this rempit drama? U bet i am. \u2014 ctzainol (@ct_zainol) October 23, 2019\n\nselena\u2019s new song is 6000% about justin and even tho she bugs me \u2026\u2026. my heart is aching for her after listening to those lyrics :( \u2014 tay \u2743 (@liltayann) October 23, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, another defended the tune as not being about the singer at all, as they wrote: \u2018This dynamic, complex ballad explores the lows of her life that she\u2019s made it through; lupus, rehab, abusive relationships and other private downfalls. she was very brave to make this.\u2019\n\nAs to the real subject of the song, maybe we\u2019ll never know.\n\nWhile we have no idea really who she\u2019s singing about, and it could all be a very convenient metaphor for no specific love, Selena has been open in having a chuckle about her previously-serious relationship with the now-married Justin.\n\nJustin is now married to Hailey (Picture: @justinbieber)\n\nIn 2013 she made a barb when David Letterman revealed his own emotional run-in with Bieber, saying: \u2018Now, the last time he was on, he and I got into a conversation and he said something and I said something, and then he said something and I said something, and I made him cry.\u2019\n\nDelivering her cutting response, the actress said: \u2018Well then, that makes two of us.\u2019\n\nAt the end of September, according to People Justin and Hailey said \u2018I do\u2019 in front of 154 guests during sunset at the five-star, 20,000 acre private resort Montage Palmetto Bluff, where rooms cost $314 (\u00a3255) a night.\n\nThey exchanged vows in a ceremony that was held on site at the Somerset Chapel in front of a star-studded guestlist, including the likes of Kendall Jenner, Katy Perry and Scooter Braun.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
