But that hasn\u2019t stopped Fox News host Sean Hannity from trying.\n\n\u201cThe problem for Republicans is that the facts are so clear, there\u2019s nothing they can say or do to defend them,\u201d the Late Night host said. As an example, he pointed to the words Trump used on his phone call with the president of Ukraine: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cwould seem like a classic quid pro quo,\u201d Meyers said before revealing how Hannity \u201ctried out a new, even dumber defense\u201d of the president. He summed it up as, \u201cIt\u2019s not a crime, because that\u2019s just how Trump talks.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Hannity characterized \u201cdo us a favor\u201d as one of Trump\u2019s \u201cgo-to phrases,\u201d adding, \u201cYou know, I say, \u2018you know,\u2019 a lot. The president uses them all the time. Kind of a verbal aside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your argument?!\u201d Meyers asked in disbelief. \u201cThat saying \u2018do us a favor\u2019 to a foreign leader is equivalent to you saying \u2018ya know?\u2019\u201d\n\nTaking Hannity\u2019s point to its next logical conclusion, the host continued, \u201cYou have to understand, Trump says \u2018do us a favor\u2019 the way Valley Girls say \u2018like\u2019 or how Jesse Pinkman says \u2018bitch\u2019 all the time. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a criminal, that\u2019s just how he talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, he\u2019s a criminal,\u201d he added.", "description": "\u201cThat\u2019s your argument?!\u201d the \u201cLate Night\u201d host asked in disbelief.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1432,w_2545,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571969402/SM_jwjk4x", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
