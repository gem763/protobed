The focus of the potential articles of impeachment, or how many there would be, remains unclear.\n\nBut the creeping inevitability that the Senate will have to act follows weeks of speculation that McConnell could find a loophole to let the Senate avoid an impeachment trial that would otherwise eat up precious floor time and put some of his 2020 incumbents under a fierce spotlight.\n\nThe GOP leader, however, shot down that possibility this week. Though McConnell positioned himself as a roadblock to Trump being removed from office in Facebook ads, he said this week that the Senate would fulfill its \"constitutional responsibility.\"\n\n\u201cUnder the impeachment rules of the Senate, we\u2019ll take the matter up \u2026 We intend to do our constitutional responsibility.\u201d\n\nMcConnell \u2014 along with Judiciary Committee staff and Sen.

Asked what the atmosphere would be like in the Senate during the impeachment trial, Blunt joked, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about banning the reporters.\u201d\n\nBut the particulars of the trial, including the length, remain up in the air.\n\n\u201cWe just talked about the Senate rules. We\u2019re going to have to have more meetings to talk about how we proceed,\u201d Kennedy said about the GOP briefing.\n\nGraham, asked what his message to the caucus was, said he warned his colleagues that it would be a \"roller coaster.\"\n\nMcConnell told senators during the closed-door lunch that a potential timeline for impeachment would be that the House passes articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, setting up the Senate to wrap up its trial by the end of the year.\n\nThat timeframe would be similar to Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, which took five weeks.\n\n\u201cI have no idea. The path, the timeline will depend on the truth line, and that's what we're looking for,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nAn impeachment trial could hit during a crucial stretch on the congressional calendar, potentially overshadowing legislation on government funding, Trump\u2019s United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) and a slate of other must-pass bills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. ...Senate impeachment uses up a lot of floor time. And so we\u2019re trying to figure out how we can get that done, and get NAFTA 2.0 done, and get the budget done,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nGOP senators are publicly questioning if they could still move legislation by coming in early each day before the formal start of the trial. And a senator reportedly asked during the GOP lunch if the Senate could dismiss the articles of impeachment without going through a trial.\n\nUnder the Senate\u2019s impeachment rules the managers could make a motion to dismiss the articles, though it\u2019s unclear why Democrats would try to quickly dismiss articles that just passed the House.\n\nBlunt added that most senators were expecting the Senate\u2019s work on impeachment to go through a trial and end with a vote on whether or not to remove Trump from office.\n\n\u201cWe have to deal with it, and we have to deal with it as soon as the managers are designated and present themselves and we have to stay on it until we\u2019re done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we all anticipate \u2026 the process would end with the other vote, which is the final vote \u2026 on impeachment that produces a result or not,\u201d he continued.\n\nSenators in both parties say they hope McConnell and Schumer will sit down and come up with a deal to establish some guardrails for a potential impeachment trial, including the length of the Senate proceeding.\n\nAsked if he was concerned McConnell could try to hamper Democrats, he added: \u201cI think he\u2019s made enough public statements now to lead me to believe that he\u2019s going to follow the regular order.\u201d\n\nSchumer agreed during a press conference with reporters that it would be \u201cprudent\u201d for him and the GOP leader to sit down and hammer out the structure.\n\n\u201cWe have to do this in a fair and bipartisan way,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd I hope that Leader McConnell would obey those scriptures.\u201d", "description": "Republicans are bracing for a high-stakes impeachment fight as soon as next month as a trial in the Senate looks all but inevitable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_101619gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
