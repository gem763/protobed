(AP) - Jacksonville\u2019s defense is no longer elite, with or without star cornerback Jalen Ramsey.\n\nThe Jaguars (2-3) have too many holes and too much inexperience on that side of the ball to be considered one of the NFL\u2019s best. They\u2019re allowing 23.6 points a game, tied for 19th in the league, and have been gouged by every non-division team on their schedule.\n\nKansas City amassed 491 yards and scored on its first seven possessions in the opener. Denver\u2019s Joe Flacco picked apart Jacksonville\u2019s secondary last week, throwing for 303 yards and three scores.\n\nIt was Christian McCaffrey\u2019s turn Sunday. He had 237 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns in Carolina\u2019s 34-27 victory , including an 84-yard scoring run. Backup Reggie Bonnafon added 80 yards on the ground late, including a 59-yard score. Both running backs went untouched on their long runs.\n\n\u201cJust a couple little minor details that we messed up on,\u201d Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue said.\n\nThe Panthers finished with 285 yards rushing, the second-most Jacksonville has allowed in franchise history. Rookie linebacker Quincy Williams got juked badly on one of McCaffrey\u2019s runs and eventually benched.\n\nJacksonville\u2019s defense was stout against Houston and Tennessee, but those are AFC South opponents that players and coaches know well. The unit also has one takeaway in five games.\n\nRamsey\u2019s return could help, although he wouldn\u2019t have provided much assistance Sunday considering Carolina did most of its damage between the tackles. The disgruntled defender, who requested a trade nearly a month ago, was in Houston on Monday to see a back specialist at the team\u2019s request.\n\nNext up is New Orleans (4-1), which has won three in a row against the Jags.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nQuarterback Gardner Minshew and receiver DJ Chark have a clear connection.\n\nChark caught eight passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns at Carolina. The second-year pro has scored in four games this season and had one called back in the other.\n\nMinshew threw for a career-high 374 yards, but lost three fumbles that led to 14 points.\n\n\u201cThose are all on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nStill, he put Jacksonville in position to tie the game in the final seconds.\n\n\u201cWhen stuff like that happens, sometimes you don\u2019t give yourself a chance to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I feel like we did, what I did.\u201d\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nJacksonville\u2019s offensive line has to be revamped in the offseason.\n\nGuard Andrew Norwell is the team\u2019s most expensive player, getting paid $13 million this season and counting $16 million against the salary cap, but he\u2019s a liability. Norwell got bulldozed into Minshew early in the second quarter, causing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. It\u2019s the kind of missed block that\u2019s become routine for one of two guards in the league being paid $13 million or more in 2019.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLeonard Fournette has consecutive 100-yard rushing games for just the second time in his NFL career, and he\u2019s broken long runs in each of the last three games.\n\nThe third-year pro finished with 108 yards on 23 carries against Carolina, a solid encore after running for a career-high 225 yards at Denver last week. A year after missing eight games because of injuries and a suspension, Fournette looks more mature and in better shape. He\u2019s made runs of 69, 81 and 48 yards the last three weeks.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nRookie linebacker Quincy Williams missed more tackles than he made against the Panthers and ended up giving way to Najee Goode in the second half. The Jaguars love the speedy third-round draft pick and plan to go back to him this week.\n\nINJURED\n\nTight end James O\u2019Shaughnessy had his left knee in a brace and was using crutches after the game, a possible indication of the severity of the injury. Rookie tight end Josh Oliver, still recovering from a significant hamstring injury, could be on verge of making his NFL debut. Safety Ronnie Harrison left the game with a neck injury and did not return.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n102 - the number of points Jacksonville has surrendered in its last three games against the Saints.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nFind a way to amicably end the Ramsey standoff, whether it\u2019s by trading him, putting him on injured reserve or getting him back on the field.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jacksonville's defense is no longer elite, with or without star cornerback Jalen Ramsey.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/jaguars_panthers_football_54372_c0-123-2949-1842_s1770x1032.jpg?be7460439b4e1cdb2a246a0d50287f8a11baa476", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
