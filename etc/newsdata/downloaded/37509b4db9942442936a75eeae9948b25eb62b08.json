The Conservatives want to take Britain out of the EU. The Labour Party want to renegotiate with the EU and put a new deal to the public, in which voters could remain. The Lib Dems would vote to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit. The Brexit Party want to leave the EU without a deal.\n\nThe 2019 General Election \u2013 the third in four years \u2013 is likely to be one of the most unpredictable in history.\n\nBoth Leave and Remain are rushing to create tactical voting apps to maximise their support.\n\nThe tactical.vote website has promised to provide voters with details of how to \u2018stop the Tories\u2019 by entering their postcode.\n\nTheir website said: \u2018The UK uses an election system called first-past-the-post, where the candidate who gets the most votes in each constituency wins.\n\n\u2018This makes it possible for candidates \u2013 and a government \u2013 to get elected without winning the support of anywhere near a majority of the voters, if the opposition is split across multiple parties.\n\n\u2018To overcome this problem, you can look at the results of the previous election in your constituency, and then vote for a party that might not be your first choice, but is the one that has the best chance of beating the Conservatives where you live.\u2019\n\nBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn finally gave his backing to a December election (Picture: EPA)\n\nCorbyn support group Momentum is targeting students with the Univotes website, where they can enter their home and university postcodes to find out where their votes will make the biggest impact for Labour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party had said it wants to target all 600 seats in the election.\n\nBut one of their most senior MEPs, John Lonsworthy, said it should focus on 20 mostly pro-Leave Labour seats in order not to scupper Mr Johnson\u2019s delivery of Brexit.\n\nThe MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber added: \u2018I think it is important for us to be sensible.\n\n\u2018I think we ought to be targeted in terms of the number of seats that we decide to address.\n\n\u2018I can imagine that might be 20 or 30. They would be entirely winnable then if you poured all your resources into them.\n\n\u2018You would probably not get any more if you concentrated on the 600. But you would also get a better result for Brexit too.\u2019\n\nNigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party has been advised to try in fewer constituencies in order to get its first MP (Picture: Reuters)\n\nThe Tories have been warned they need to win 50 Labour seats to offset expected losses to Remainers in Scotland and the South.\n\nThey are set to target the so-called \u2018Workington Man\u2019 \u2013 who is older, white, non-graduate and male living in rugby league towns in the North of England.\n\nOnward, a right-leaning think-tank, said these people voted Leave in the EU referendum but are typically Labour voters.\n\nThe constituency of Workington, Cumbria, will be the bellweather seat and is currently held by Labour\u2019s Sue Hayman with a 4,000 majority.\n\nWill Tanner, director of Onward, said: \u2018This election will be the most volatile in living memory and no party should be complacent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But it is clear that the Conservatives\u2019 path to victory runs through working-class rugby league towns like Workington, Warrington and Wigan, which usually do not give them a second thought \u2013 as well as the party\u2019s leafy heartlands in the South of England.\u2019\n\nJo Swinson will be campaigning to stop Brexit (Picture: PA)\n\nThe Lib Dems, who currently have 19 seats, have been \u2018revived\u2019 in the polls at around 18%.\n\nThey will be pushing a clear Remain policy and Chukka Umunna said he believes they can double their current tally of MPs.\n\nPolling expert Sir John Curtice has warned that the UK could be on track for another hung Parliament.\n\nThose with the most votes could try to strike up a coalition with one or more smaller parties.\n\nThe Tories, DUP and the Brexit Party would be the most likely to come together to finish off Brexit.\n\nLabour could try and sign a pact with the Lib Dems or the SNP or both.", "description": "Boris Johnson is on course to win a Commons majority unless Remain voters work tactically to block a Tory victory, research has revealed.
