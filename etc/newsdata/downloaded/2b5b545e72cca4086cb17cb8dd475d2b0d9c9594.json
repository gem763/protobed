In July, the fund lowered its projection to 3.2 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next year \u2014 its fourth downgrade since last October.\n\nThe global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva\n\nGlobal institutions, economists and investors are blaming the U.S.-China tariff conflict as a prime factor for slowing global growth. The trade tensions have partly caused manufacturing to tumble and weakened investment, creating a \u201cserious risk\u201d of spillover to other areas of the economy like services and consumption, Georgieva said in prepared remarks in Washington on Tuesday. Global trade growth is close to a standstill, she added.\n\n\u201cThe global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown,\u201d she said, noting that the fund estimates that 90 per cent of of the world is seeing slower growth. By contrast, two years ago, growth was accelerating across three-quarters of the globe in a synchronized upswing, she added.\n\n\u201cUncertainty \u2014 driven by trade but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions \u2014 is holding back economic potential,\u201d Georgieva said. Not only that, but the economic rifts could \u201clast a generation\u201d with possible shifts such as broken supply changes and siloed trade.\n\n\u201cThere is also in my view a risk of complacency,\u201d she said in an on-stage conversation with Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene in Washington following her speech. \u201cWe are decelerating, we are not stopping, and it\u2019s not that bad. And yet, unless we act now, we are risking a potential more-massive slowdown.\u201d\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development trimmed its forecast last month, while World Bank President David Malpass said Monday that the lender is preparing to downgrade its assessment from a projection of 2.6 per cent it made in June.\n\nA deeper slowdown would require more fiscal support, Georgieva said. \u201cIf the global economy slows more sharply than expected, a coordinated fiscal response may be needed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not there\u201d but it\u2019s better to be too early with it than late.\n\nOn monetary policy, Georgieva said central banks should keep interest rates low where appropriate, \u201cespecially since inflation is still subdued in many countries and overall growth is weakening.\u201d She warned, however, that very low or even negative interest rates can come with \u201cnegative side effects and unintended consequences\u201d that can lead to financial vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cMonetary and financial policies cannot do the job alone. Fiscal policy must play a central role,\u201d she said.\n\nGeorgieva, former chief executive officer of the World Bank, took over on Oct. 1 as IMF managing director, succeeding Christine Lagarde, who left to lead the European Central Bank.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "'Coordinated fiscal response may be needed'", "authors": ["Sarah Mcgregor", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/imf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
