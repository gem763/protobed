They get to vote against whoever they want.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Clinton teased the possibility that she would throw her hat into the crowded Democratic primary field, responding to a tweet from President Trump goading her to enter the race with, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nHowever, Reines assured viewers that the unsuccessful 2016 Democratic nominee\u2019s decision to run again would not be based on \u201canxiety\u201d about the current field of 2020 Democrats.\n\n\u201cShe really likes a lot of the people running,\u201d he said. \u201cShe thought about some of them for her vice presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there might be a reason that she\u2019d be the best person, not only to beat Donald Trump, but to govern after Donald Trump, which is a part we don\u2019t talk about much,\u201d Reines added. \u201cAnd, look, you can make fun of her all you want, but 65 million people voted for her and that\u2019s second more to anyone except Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren currently leads among the over a dozen Democratic 2020 candidates, trailed by former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.", "description": "\"If she thought she had the best odds of beating Donald Trump I think she would think about it long and hard,\" Philippe Reines told Tucker Carlson.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
