If you talk positively about your money situation, that\u2019s considered bad form, but if you admit you\u2019re struggling, that\u2019s a source of shame.\n\nHow I Save is our weekly series hoping to open up the conversation.\n\nEach week we chat to a different person, tracking how they spend and save their money for a week. Then we get some expert advice they (and we) can learn from.\n\nThis time we\u2019re chatting to Hannah (not her real name), a 28-year-old senior marketing executive living in Manchester.\n\nHow Hannah saves:\n\nI earn \u00a330k a year. In my savings accounts right now I have \u00a316,750 saved \u2013 \u00a31,500 in a New Zealand bank account, \u00a315,000 in a pensions-type scheme, and \u00a3250 of savings in the UK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve saved this by hiding money from myself. I was being paid into my New Zealand bank account for a remote job and I would keep some in an inaccessible savings account.\n\nIn the UK I\u2019ve only saved \u00a3250 because I got paid a week ago and finally decided I needed to start saving rather than spend every last penny every month. I hope it\u2019ll last!\n\nI\u2019m saving for a deposit for a new flat. I also want to save for a cheap laptop/tablet to do some personal projects (I only have a smartphone!) and I want some savings put aside so I have some security if I lost my job or had to move back to New Zealand.\n\nIf I have \u00a350 left at the end of the month I\u2019ve had a great month. I spend pretty lavishly I think, I enjoy eating out and spending time with friends and travelling. I am usually the type to think \u2018I could die tomorrow, let\u2019s have some experiences today\u2019.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much I should actually spend on things in comparison to my lifestyle. Is my spending on food outrageous? I assume it probably is, but I\u2019ll think \u2018f*** it\u2019 and buy it anyway. I\u2019ve never had the \u2018payoff\u2019 of saving up hard for something and finally being able to buy it. Usually, I will hire purchase or get a loan for a big spend such as new furniture or a car. I\u2019m usually really good at paying things off \u2013 I only have \u00a3500 in debt on a low-interest credit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Hannah spends:\n\nMonthly expenses:\n\n\u00a3400 for rent in a three-bedroom semi-detached house share.\n\n\u00a3108 for bills \u2013 electricity, water, internet, gas.\n\n\u00a360 a month for an accountant from my freelance days (almost a year ago!). I should probably stop this!\n\n\u00a312 on Youtube Premium \u2013 I use this every day, I watch A LOT of Youtube.\n\n\u00a310 on Spotify \u2013 integral.\n\n\u00a320 on a car club \u2013 I don\u2019t have a car so I use a car club to borrow a car every month or so to go on day trips or something as simple as doing a huge haul at Ikea. It\u2019s cheaper than hiring a car the old fashioned way.\n\n\u00a350 for a monthly tram pass\n\n\u00a320 for my monthly cell phone bill\n\n\u00a38 for my Netflix subscription\n\nA *lot* of Hannah\u2019s money goes on food (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nA week of spending:\n\nSaturday: Today my friends from out of town came to visit me in Manchester, so I knew up front that this would probably be an expensive weekend as I would take them around and show them all the sights and sounds.\n\nA return tram ticket into the city centre is \u00a37, then I spend \u00a318 on dinner at a nice place, two tacos and a margarita.\n\nThen I spend \u00a38 at the Co-op on the way back because I wanted some snacks to eat while watching a movie once I got home.\n\nSunday: Continued fun with my friends. We walked around the city and enjoyed various bars and shops from 11am until 11pm! I barely ever go to bars or pubs, so this was a bit of a treat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was running late for brunch with my friends, so I caught an Uber into town rather than the tram \u2013 \u00a38.\n\n\u00a312 went on brunch at a nice cafe, then \u00a316 went on a new book recommended to me by friends. I\u2019m trying to get back into reading and this one looks great!\n\nI spend \u00a331 at the pub \u2013 I paid for a round of drinks and some snacks after lots of walking. It\u2019s one of the nice pubs in Manchester perfect for tourists, so a little expensive. They bought the next two rounds at another bar, so it all evened out.\n\nThen I spend \u00a38 at an arcade bar \u2013 one soda and \u00a35 of tokens to play some games.\n\nDinner at a nice restaurant \u2013 including a couple of mocktails \u2013 comes to \u00a325. I had to pay my friend back for the weed he bought me a week back and he prompted me to pay him. I don\u2019t spend money on alcohol or going out partying really, so \u00a320 on weed as my only vice lasts me a month or two.\n\nMonday: Back at work today so typically I\u2019ll only spend for lunch and dinner. I don\u2019t eat breakfast and most of the time I\u2019ll get a coffee at work (unless I\u2019m grumpy and need a pickmeup from Greggs or Nero!)\n\nEach month I\u2019ll usually have one or two big spends planned. This month I knew I\u2019d have to spend big on some flights, and also getting my hair dyed. I\u2019ll then try to keep all other purchases to a minimum (other than food or hanging with friends which are generally pretty loose and I tend not to budget for).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I use Monzo, so all my purchases are rounded-up and the extra pennies/50p go into my savings account. Since 28 September this has already provided me with an extra \u00a328 in savings.\n\nI spend \u00a3194 on tickets to Sweden \u2013 I\u2019m meeting a friend in December in Stockholm and needed to buy ahead so they didn\u2019t get too expensive. This was the cheapest possible flight I could find.\n\n\u00a37 goes on lunch \u2013 I wanted something healthy today so went with a salad box from Friska then \u00a37 at Aldi for a cheap pizza for dinner and some toiletries.\n\nI have chronic illnesses so I have to fill quite a few prescriptions each month. Today I pick up one of them for \u00a39.\n\nTuesday: \u00a33 at Greggs for a grumpy breakfast. I needed that bacon and sausage with red sauce and a cheeky flat white to get through the morning.\n\n\u00a36 at the local Chinese supermarket for lunch \u2013 two packets of noodles and some kimchi to last me two different lunches.\n\n\u00a310 at Tesco for dinner Went full hog and got a bunch of ingredients to make tacos from scratch, including guacamole and dessert.\n\nThanks to being chronically ill, I had to have a specialist appointment in Leeds. As a result I spend \u00a368 on train tickets for me and a friend acting as a support person. Trains are expensive and being unwell is not cheap.\n\nWednesday: Today I had to go to Leeds for my specialist doctor appointment which required some added expenses I don\u2019t typically expect.\n\n\u00a38 for two flat whites and a muffin \u2013 shouted my support person/BFF a coffee as it was an early morning train and I felt bad for dragging her along (but extremely grateful for her company).\n\nI then got an \u00a38 Uber from Leeds station to the hospital\u2026 the wrong hospital, so that meant \u00a36 on another Uber racing to the actual hospital I meant to go to.\n\nThen \u00a36 went on another Uber from the second hospital back to the Leeds train station.\n\nLunch is \u00a39 at Pret a Manger \u2013 a sandwich, a coffee, and a cookie. I needed something quick and tasty before racing back onto the train and heading back to work in Manchester for the rest of the day.\n\nMy hands have been super dry so I buy a \u00a35 hand cream from The Body Shop.\n\nAfter work I was in the bathroom cleaning my piercing and the ball fell off and down the sink. Nightmare. Had to race to Claire\u2019s Accessories (the only place open at that time) and buy a new piercing for \u00a314 so the hole doesn\u2019t close up. Not planned, and I was NOT happy to have to buy from Claires!\n\n\u00a36 at Tesco \u2013 This was for dinner, something small and simple so I could just go to bed after a nightmarish day.\n\nThursday: Lunch is \u00a38 at Leon, where I meet up with a friend before she leaves the country.\n\nThen for dinner, I grab bits for a nice creamy pasta for \u00a36. Tesco didn\u2019t have the salmon that I wanted, so I had to go down the road to M&S to grab some for \u00a35. Usually I don\u2019t buy food here because it\u2019s a bit too expensive, but it was out of stock at Tesco.\n\nFriday: Another grumpy morning, another Greggs breakfast to cheer me up \u2013 \u00a33.\n\n\u00a310 at a Korean restaurant. I went out for dinner with a friend to catch up. Only ordered one thing from the menu and no drinks to try and keep costs down.\n\n\u00a34 at Sainsburys \u2013 on the way home after dinner I decided to treat myself because it was Friday night and get some ice cream from Sainsbury\u2019s. Craaaazy Friday night in front of the telly with a Magnum, what a dream.\n\nTotal spent this week: \u00a3539.\n\nHow Hannah could save: We spoke to the experts over at money tracking app Cleo to find out how Hannah can save better (and what we can learn from her spending). Note: the advice featured is specific to one individual and doesn\u2019t constitute financial advice, especially for a London budget. Ever heard of a supermarket? Your food spend is frivolous and you know it. The munchies probably aren\u2019t helping either. Main vice: We totted up all the food spending you got through over the week. It took us a while, but the results are in: \u00a3147. That\u2019s \u00a3588 per month i.e. \u00a3188 more than your rent (and it\u2019s not even listed as a bill). Living in the moment is zen and all, but a bit of foresight is going to make for a much more exciting financial future. We suggest you kick things off with a weekly supermarket shop. For anyone reading: we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve heard it before, but meal planning works a treat when it comes to saving. You\u2019re unlikely to ready yourself for a solid bank balance with a plethora of ad hoc Prets. Where you\u2019re going right: \u00a315k in a pensions-type scheme. Love it. Roundups? Fantastic. We\u2019ve also heard you can hide money from yourself using clever algorithms\u2026 We\u2019re big fans of spending on experiences, so we back that flight to Sweden. Here\u2019s your spending plan: Safe to spend: \u00a31,200 for the monthly expenses you mentioned, plus a weekly supermarket trip and money for your healthcare needs. We\u2019ve also factored in \u00a310 a week for your grumpy Greggs fund, and let you keep \u00a36 a day for your lunch (we know habits are hard to break). Safe to burn: \u00a3360 for the pub, meals out and the odd accidental Uber. This includes your two big spends a month, so choose carefully. Safe to save: \u00a3340, which means it should take you less than two months to wipe that \u00a3500 of credit card debt and get on that flat deposit. Bottom line: Contrary to the popular saying, it\u2019s time to stop putting your money where your mouth is.\n\nHow I Save is a weekly series about how people spend and save, out every Thursday.
