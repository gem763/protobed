The man nicknamed \u2018The Dog\u2019 recovered from poor footwork to snap his opponent\u2019s head back, ensuring fans and himself that he belongs at the top of one of boxing\u2018s most glamorous divisions.\n\nAs the fight went into the telling 11th round, everything was still completely up for grabs and the truest moment landed. A left hand to the chin saw Porter touch down on the canvas and in the rugged, animalistic like nature we\u2019ve seen over the years, the now former WBC title holder shrugged it off and climed back to his feet immediately to see out the round.\n\nFrustrated walking back to his corner, Porter showed he it wasn\u2019t in him to give in: \u201cI couldn\u2019t drop my hands in defeat, I had to get back out there,\u201d he said in the ring after the final bell.\n\nBut it\u2019s Spence who will go on and continue to rise up the ranks, Danny Garcia is next and then it could be Manny Pacquiao or Terence Crawford as we edge ever closer to finding out who the true No 1 of the welterweight division is.", "description": "Errol Spence beat Shawn Porter by split\u00a0decision to unify the welterweight division.
