But the reappearance of socialism is more a sign of a wide partisan divide than it is evidence that people want to change America\u2019s economic system.\n\nWhen Democratic lawmakers and left-leaning spokespeople talk about socialism \u2014 or democratic socialism \u2014 they\u2019re not talking about changing the means of production. When your college sophomore nephew expresses some sympathy for socialism at Thanksgiving dinner, he\u2019ll likely be talking about just expanding the social welfare programs that already exist and maybe importing others from Europe.\n\nWe\u2019ve already got a lot of this kind of socialism in America. There\u2019s Social Security and Medicare, and states keep mandating that businesses offer paid leave to employees. When the people on the left talk glowingly of socialism, they tend to talk about a socialism that is a couple large steps down the path of bigger government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen young people invoke socialism, however, conservatives hear something else. To them, socialism represents a different economic system where the state owns the means of production and the political system distributes the value created by production. The socialism they know is a failed experiment that resulted in atrocities committed by authoritarian regimes against their own citizens. Embracing socialism seems sinister, and something that no rational person should ever consider.\n\nSocialism as big government and socialism as state-controlled economic enterprise are radically different concepts. So, it\u2019s important to note that what is heard might not be what the person means on both sides.\n\nYet the return of \u201csocialism\u201d means something. For one, it means that conservatives have tarnished big government ideas to young people so much that the youth have rebranded them. It\u2019s not a liberal program anymore; it\u2019s socialism.\n\nThat can explain why it sounds like younger people are embracing socialism \u2014 older people are attached to the labels of big government that left a bad taste in younger people\u2019s mouths.\n\nConservatives ought to be comforted by another thing. I could be wrong about this, but I don\u2019t hear that younger people are interested in using the state to reform society to their will. There\u2019s been a lot of that in the past \u2014 a call for a complete overhaul of society through political means. But the socialism of younger people today sounds nothing like that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s not a call for a new French Revolution, but rather a call for a couple of steps towards bigger government. They don\u2019t want to overthrow the rich, just tax them some more. Many want to adopt the policies of Scandinavian countries or other places that sound wealthy and to the left of America. But those places have property rights, markets, individual freedom and the rule of law, even with other redistributive policies and government mandates.\n\nSure, extremists are around and they make the news. There are real people on the far left, and the kind of socialism they want is exactly the kind that conservatives think they mean.\n\nThe socialism-embracing youngsters who defy such extremism ought to be more careful with the term. Socialism is not a term of persuasion. It\u2019s a term that unites its allies and repels its enemies. The term can be used to attract the kind of people who are inclined to support socialism while doing the opposite for others.\n\nThis is what ought to upset Americans about socialism\u2019s reemergence. It\u2019s a sign that what people want from the political debate is to animate and mobilize against their enemies, instead of persuading their peers.\n\nAmericans ought to reject this tendency. It is a large country and it\u2019s easier to keep it together when people carry around the assumption that their fellow Americans have dignity even when their politics are different. When enemies are treated as though they lack dignity, they are treated as people to be overcome, not people to be persuaded.\n\nUntil we seek more to persuade than to rabble-rouse, we\u2019re going to be left with people proclaiming the virtues of socialism. One way out of this mire is to understand that the person spouting its benefits might not actually mean what you think they mean. And in understanding each other, we get closer to a world where political debate is an attempt to persuade rather than to overcome.\n\nJames M.
