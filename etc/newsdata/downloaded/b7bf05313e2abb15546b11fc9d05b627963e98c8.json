In another bout with the liberal media, President Trump has emerged victorious. Over the couple days, networks have been going berserk over a minor map controversy. President Trump showed a map of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s projected path that included Alabama possibly being impacted. It changed course, as a lot of storms do from time to time. It\u2019s not working its way up the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, but \u201csharpiegate\u201d was borne nonetheless (via Roll Call):\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u2026 dragged another self-created scandal into another day as he defended a map he displayed a day earlier of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s expected path that appeared to have been altered, prompting howls from Democrats and accusations that he was putting lives in danger. White House aides were eager last week to portray a commander in chief as deeply involved in the federal government\u2019s efforts to prepare for and respond to Dorian. The storm even did the Trump team a favor when it turned away from Florida, sparing the Sunshine State the kind of catastrophic direct hit that left at least 20 dead and catastrophic damage in the Bahamas. [\u2026] Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was asked about the apparently doctored map Thursday morning on CNN. He replied: \u201cI\u2019m really worried about him. I feel sorry for the president.\u201d Buttigieg, who a recent Quinnipiac University poll showed would defeat Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head race, said he bets either Trump drew an extra line on the chart Trump displayed for Wednesday\u2019s press pool as he sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office or his staff did to \u201cprotect\u201d the boss\u2019s ego. The black marker line beside the computer-generated white ones on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-prepared map amounted to yet another self-inflicted wound for Trump and his team as they ramp up a reelection effort. It only handed foes like Buttigieg a new tool with which to bludgeon what they see as an incompetent president and administration.\n\nAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nThe overreaction intensified when the National Weather Service office in Birmingham tweeted \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama.\u201d\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nHi @CNN, I know you guys are busy analyzing lines on a map, but perhaps you use your time to study up on U.S. geography? pic.twitter.com/kVgifHfPK4 \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) September 5, 2019\n\nCNN told Alabama to \"be on the lookout\" for Dorian on 8/28.\n\n\n\n\"There are many states that are under threat right now.\"\n\n\n\n\"At least 6. From the Carolinas right through Georgia coastline into Florida certainly & then also even into the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi\" pic.twitter.com/FzF14leKI8 \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 6, 2019\n\nCNN couldn\u2019t even find Alabama on a map, believing the state to be Mississippi in graphics. Oh, and they even said that Alabama could be impacted by Dorian, so yeah\u2014you should feel bad for the fake news media, not Donald Trump. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a statement today saying that they told the Trump White House that Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama, which at the time was a major hurricane:\n\nFrom Wednesday, August 28, through Monday, September 2, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama. This is clearly demonstrated in Hurricane Advisories #15 through #41, which can be viewed at thefollowing link. The Birmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\n\nI mean it\u2019s almost becoming embarrassing how the liberal media gets played, slapped down, and utterly owned every time they try to attack this presidency. Trump is an absolute professional at making them look like morons, and this Dorian non-troversy was no different.\n\nHappy Friday.", "description": ".09/06/2019 22:11:13PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/2bdeda77-8967-45f6-92d8-00285390b523.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
