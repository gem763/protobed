Obviously they are concerned over their possible loss of dignity, whatever that might mean.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be that while other ethnic groups can have their gatherings to discuss their affairs, the Malays cannot, that their gathering is racist.\u201d\n\nVocal minority leaders from within Dr Mahathir\u2019s Pakatan Harapan coalition have criticised the congress, drawing attention to the content of speeches delivered by several speakers which they felt promoted Malay political supremacy.\n\nThe congress was attended by some 5,000 people, including top Umno, PAS and Pakatan Harapan leaders.\n\nBut to the prime minister, the criticism was unwarranted. Highlighting this in his post, Dr Mahathir said he felt the tone of the congress was \u201cbalanced\u201d, even as the views expressed by some were thought to be \u201cextreme\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs usual there were extreme views but on the whole they were balanced.\u201d\n\nWhat upset critics most is that the congress was organised by public universities funded by taxpayers\u2019 money. Detractors argue that learning institutions should be free from racial politics, even more so under a new government that pledged inclusive ideals in place of communalism.\n\nThe main organiser of the congress was Universiti Malaya\u2019s Malay excellence studies centre, and co-organised by Universiti Teknologi Mara, Universiti Putra Malaysia and the Sultan Idris Education University.\n\nDr Mahathir asked why there were calls for UM vice-chancellor Datuk Abdul Rahim Hashim to be removed simply for organising a gathering that the Bersatu chairman felt was merely to address the weaknesses of the Malay community.\n\n\u201cNow there is even a demand that the Malay initiator of the gathering should be sacked for attending.\u201d\n\nDr Mahathir also reminded critics that the country\u2019s minorities have been accorded rights and freedom not seen even in the most advanced democracies.\n\nHere, he said a million of non-indigenous people were given citizenship even though they were not qualified, and are allowed to manifest this ethnic link through their language, culture, schools and ethnic organisations.\n\nBut Dr Mahathir suggested any effort by the Malays to organise are often viewed with suspicion and quickly labelled racist.\n\n\u201cIt hurts me to think in their own country the indigenous people are not supposed to have their own gatherings without being accused of being racist,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAnd now of course I will be labelled a racist for writing this.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Ambassador welcomes Malaysia\u2019s plan to open Palestine-accredited embassy in Jordan Trade wars causing havoc on world economy, says Dr M Muhyiddin says PM power transition has been discussed, no fixed timeline", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 \u2014 Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad questioned today why the Malay Dignity Congress was labelled racist when other ethnicities have held similar assemblies, in a rebuttal...", "authors": ["Syed Jaymal Zahiid"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/brcrLRpaac65QW18exO5yw--~B/aD02ODg7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/32e88072e2fe1e363cef82e6c603bb75", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
