'I said to them, they had to immediately be declared so they could go into a museum.\n\n'But George said it would be worth at least \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000.\n\n'Layton was of the same opinion as me, but George remained focused on the money to the point I had to swear at him to quieten him down.\n\n'We were sat in the cafe, surrounded by people, and I remember saying to George \"shut the f*** up\".'\n\nHe added: 'I think Layton was intimidated by George. Both Jason and I were of the opinion Layton wanted to declare the items, while George was in it for the money.'\n\nThe men agreed the items would be taken for detailed examination by Mr Sallam, who then returned them to Wells.\n\n'Jason explained to me they were so rare it would change the rules of metal detectoring and again relayed the importance of their being declared to the correct authorities,' said Wells.\n\nWells added that when Davies subsequently collected the objects, he passed five coins back to the dealer for safe-keeping, and 'explained to me they had' reported the finds.\n\nPowell, of Newport; Davies, of Pontypridd; Wells, of Cardiff; and Wicks, of Hailsham, East Sussex, deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Paul Wells (pictured) claimed that co-defendant George Powell 'was in it for the money' after he found an 'invaluable' collection of buried treasure in Herefordshire.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/19266766-0-image-a-83_1572278565123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
