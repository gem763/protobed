She had some difficulty convincing the riot police to send her to a hospital instead of tossing her in jail, but she eventually prevailed. According to the report:\n\nLam was admitted to the maternity ward at Tuen Mun Hospital guarded by a female and a male officer. She underwent a medical checkup at a room in the ward. According to Lam, a female officer said she needed to be searched. Lam was on a bed, already in an operation robe, and had removed all of her clothes. Lam said that the female officer then examined her bag and clothes. Another male officer then entered the room, despite an attempt by medical staff members to block his access. Lam said she had yet to tie her operation robe up and was otherwise naked. Medical staff then covered her with a blanket. The officer asked Lam to confirm her personal details including name, phone number and address, and left five minutes later, she said: \u201cI feel helpless \u2013 why can a man who I don\u2019t know enter? Usually, only the partner of the pregnant woman could enter \u2013 I was embarrassed at the time, I kept on checking if I covered myself,\u201d Lam told Ming Pao [a local Chinese-language newspaper].\n\nPolice officials on Wednesday admitted a male officer entered the maternity ward, but claimed all \u201cstandard procedures\u201d were followed to \u201crespect privacy\u201d and ensure the operation of the hospital was not affected \u2026 but then on Thursday they reversed themselves and denied that any police officers, male or female, intruded on the maternity ward. This claim was removed without explanation within an hour, and the Hospital Authority confirmed Lam\u2019s story on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe admit that there is room for our colleagues to improve their sensitivity,\u201d a police spokesman said.\n\nAlso hospitalized during Monday\u2019s protests was a 27-year-old man who was placed in intensive care with a brain hemorrhage due to \u201chard objects striking his head.\u201d The man was reportedly in stable condition as of Friday morning. Three other men and a woman requested medical treatment after the Monday demonstrations.", "description": "A male Hong Kong police officer forced his way into a maternity ward as a 19-year-old pregnant protester was disrobed for a body search.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1174360435-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
