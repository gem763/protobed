REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.5% to their highest since Aug. 1, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose more than 1.0% to four-month highs. Markets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for public holidays.\n\nEuropean stocks are set to track Asia\u2019s firmer tone, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.1%, Germany\u2019s DAX futures up 0.1% and London\u2019s FTSE futures higher by 0.2%.\n\n\u201cRisk assets should find further support from accommodative policies, which are set to remain in vogue for some time, and not just in Europe as seen in the global easing trend,\u201d said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, we believe that trade uncertainty and growth concerns will not vanish, so any reprieve on either subject will be welcome. We also believe that some earnings growth will be needed for equities to grind higher,\u201d she said.\n\nThe United States on Thursday welcomed China\u2019s renewed purchases of U.S. farm goods while maintaining the threat of U.S. tariff hikes as the world\u2019s two largest economies prepared for talks aimed at breaking their trade war impasse.\n\nTrump said he preferred a comprehensive trade deal with China but did not rule out the possibility of an interim pact, even as he said an \u201ceasy\u201d agreement would not be possible.\n\nInvestors bet optimism will prevail in the near future though most economists in a Reuters poll believed the trade dispute will worsen or at best stay the same over the coming year.\n\nThe U.S. S&P 500 closed within striking distance of its all-time closing high, rising 0.29% to 3,009.57, near a record closing high of 3,024.50 marked in late July.\n\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor share index hit an all-time high while MSCI ACWI also came near this year\u2019s peak after seven straight days of gains by Thursday.\n\nSentiment found modest support from Trump\u2019s planned tax overhaul aimed at middle-income households next year.\n\nCENTRAL BANKS\n\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank delivered bigger-than-expected stimulus, cutting interest rates by 0.10 percentage point to minus 0.50%, promising that rates would stay low for longer and restarting bond purchases of 20 billion euros a month from November.\n\nThe resumption of quantitative easing had been seen as a close call and helped to boost risk assets.\n\nBut the euro quickly lost steam and European bond yields also rose as profit-taking set in.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi stepped up his rhetoric in calling for governments to spend their way out of a slowdown, highlighting the limitations of monetary policy and also fanning expectations of fiscal spending down the road.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.1085 near the two-week high hit in U.S. trade, having risen 0.5 percent on Thursday.\n\nRising risk appetite kept the yen near its six-week low of 108 to the dollar.\n\nTen-year German Bund yields also rose back to minus 0.503%.\n\nThat also helped keep the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries at 1.7838%, near early August levels, breached in Thursday\u2019s session.\n\nFed funds rate futures imply a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut by the Fed next week but have effectively priced out any chance of a larger cut.\n\nThe Fed will announce its policy on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday.\n\nSources told Reuters the BOJ is leaning towards standing pat next week if markets are calm, but is brainstorming ways to deepen negative interest rates at minimal cost.\n\n\u201cI think a rally in stock prices will run out of steam soon. It\u2019s typical buy-on-rumour-sell-on-fact trade on central bank stimulus and will be over by the Fed and the BOJ\u2019s meetings,\u201d said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cPeople also seem to think there will be a deal between China and the States soon but you never know when suddenly Trump (does an) about-face. We just saw that in May and August,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump unveiled a hike in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports in early May and announced another 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion imports from China in early August. U.S. stock prices were at record levels on both occasions.\n\nOil prices were on course to post weekly losses, on continued worries about weakening demand and on speculation Trump may ease sanctions on Iran after his former national security adviser John Bolton, an Iran hawk, left the White House earlier this week.\n\nA man is reflected on a stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, August 5, 2019.
