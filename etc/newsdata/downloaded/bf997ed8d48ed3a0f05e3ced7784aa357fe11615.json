In an attempt to curb the tourism that feeds into this unethical industry, Airbnb is offering animal experiences.\n\nMuch like the normal local trips and experiences they offer, the brand is allowing travellers to go on guilt-free excursions via their website.\n\nAirbnb will facilitate 1,000 animal-friendly excursions, tours and activities across 58 countries.\n\nSo you can go forth and pet elephants and pose side by side with a horse knowing they\u2019re being well looked after.\n\nOr you can stand back and observe the likes of dolphins, lions, bears, penguins, deers and much much more. You can even visit the dogs of Chernobyl.\n\nIf you\u2019re more of a doer, there\u2019s also a bunch of activities letting you play with them, whether your choice of play buddy is a corgi to paddleboard with or a goat to hike or do yoga with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are even 122 opportunities to care for animals too, allowing you to hug cows, become a beekeeper for a day, be a manatee caretaker.\n\nAnd good news \u2013 all the experiences must follow World Animal Protection (WAP) guidelines, so you can connect with a clear conscience.\n\nWanna paddleboard with a corgi? (Picture: Airbnb)\n\nUnder the WAP criteria, experiences won\u2019t allow direct contact with wild animals, including petting, feeding or riding.\n\nThere are also strict rules relating to working animals and no excursions related to marine animals held in captivity.\n\nBusinesses running tours or activities which are known to trade illegal wildlife or partake in animal sporting/entertainment will be excluded from the experiences.\n\nThose who meet the guidelines will be awarded a WAP to assure visitors that they meet ethical standards.\n\nAll activities have to be approved by the Wildlife Animal Protection group (Picture: Airbnb)\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a limited number of activities available in Asia but the endeavour is still new so it\u2019s hoped more organisations will sign up.\n\nAt the moment, you can enjoy horseback riding in Vietnam, bird-watching in India, and swimming with giant whale sharks in the Philippines among others.\n\n\u2018We know people love animals and want to see and experience them when they travel, but we also know they most want to see animals in a setting that respects their well-being,\u2019 said Alesia Soltanpanah from World Animal Protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This new animal welfare policy created in consultation with our animal welfare experts combined with the creativity and dedication of Airbnb will ensure that adventurers have many options to experience the beauty of animals in a way that considers their welfare first.\u2019\n\nYou can check out the full range of Animal Experiences on the Airbnb website.\n\nMORE: You\u2019ll soon be able to rent a Malibu Barbie Dreamhouse on Airbnb\n\nMORE: Airbnb is sending five people on a free month-long climate research trip to Antarctica\n\nMORE: Single mum puts backseat of car on AirBnB for \u00a38 a night\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Airbnb's Animal Experiences must follow World Animal Protection (WAP) guidelines, so you can connect with a clear conscience.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91013837_1571662373.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
