'Never say never', says Margaret Atwood", "language": "en", "text": "Canadian author of The Testaments refuses to rule it out, saying she was pushed to writing the sequel by US moves to police women\u2019s bodies\n\nThe growing similarities between the US and her fictional regime of Gilead, where women\u2019s bodies are policed by a totalitarian state, helped prompt Margaret Atwood into writing a sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, the author has said.\n\nThe Testaments was released worldwide today, 34 years after the story of Offred ended in the first book. Speaking about it publicly for the first time, Atwood said that there had been \u201cmany requests for a sequel\u201d over the intervening years, but she \u201calways said no\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, as time moved on, instead of moving further away from Gilead we moved towards it, particularly in the US, and I re-examined that position,\u201d said the 79-year-old novelist, who attended a midnight launch for the novel in London the previous evening.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Copies of The Testaments on display in a London branch of Waterstones. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\n\u201cI decided that although I could not continue with the story of Offred, I could continue with three other people and tell the story of the beginning of the end. We know from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale that Gilead vanishes, it\u2019s no longer present 200 years later because we\u2019re having a symposium on it \u2026 So how did it collapse? How do these kinds of regimes disappear? I was interested in exploring that and also what it would be like for the second generation.\u201d\n\nShe sent a two-paragraph summary to her publishers in February 2017. The acclaimed television adaptation, which the novelist reads scripts for, but claims to have \u201cno actual power\u201d over, began in April that year.\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood \u2013 read the exclusive first extract Read more\n\nThe Testaments follows three characters: two young women, one who grows up inside Gilead and one who has been brought up in Canada; and Aunt Lydia, a fearsome and opaque figure in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, who reveals how she survived during the earliest days of the regime.\n\nAtwood believes her new story \u201centers into a conversation that\u2019s already taking place\u201d, with legislative moves affecting women\u2019s rights in several US states meaning that \u201csome of them are already there [in Gilead]\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat these restrictive laws about women\u2019s bodies are claiming is that the state owns your body. There is a parallel occasion for men and that would be the draft: the state owns your body and you have to go to war. But when they do that, they pay for clothes, lodging, food, medical expenses and a salary,\u201d said a deeply sardonic Atwood.\n\n\u201cI say unto them, if you want to conscript women\u2019s bodies in this way, you\u2019re forcing women to deliver babies, forced childbirth, and you\u2019re not paying for any of it. It is very cheap, amongst other things. For a society claiming to value individual freedom I would say to them, you evidently don\u2019t think those freedoms extend to women.\u201d\n\nUntil the cold war ended, Atwood said, \u201cthe US was selling itself as the alternative to the cold war evil empire. They were the land of freedom, democracy, opportunity for all, and therefore they were not showcasing their shadow side \u2026 once that opponent was gone, everything could come out of the cupboard that had always been there. Out it has come.\u201d\n\nWith protesters around the world adopting the red costumes of the Handmaids to silently campaign for women\u2019s rights, including demonstrations in Ireland, Argentina and recently in Texas, where an all-male council voted to ban abortion in June, Atwood said her creations worked as a form of civil protest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making a disturbance, not saying anything ... you\u2019re all covered up, no frightful bare shoulders,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of this would be happening if countries were not putting other people in charge of women\u2019s bodies. If everything were fair and equitable, and government really was by consent of the governed, only potentially pregnant women would be able to vote on these matters.\u201d\n\nWith The Testaments shortlisted for the Booker prize \u2013 judges called it a \u201csavage and beautiful novel\u201d which \u201cspeaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power\u201d \u2013 and readers so desperate to get their hands on the book that they were queueing up for it at midnight, Atwood gave a wry smile to suggestions that she is a literary rock star.\n\n\u201cConsidering the lives rock stars lead, I hope not. I haven\u2019t yet died of an opiate overdose, not yet, but there\u2019s time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis kind of thing could be quite ruinous for a 35-year-old because where do you go from there? But in my case we kind of know the answer.\u201d One thing she refused to rule out was whether she would ever return to Gilead again: \u201cNever say never to anything.\u201d", "description": "Canadian author of The Testaments refuses to rule it out, saying she was pushed to writing the sequel by US moves to police women\u2019s bodies", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a295a5bc87a463e1d2cd4225599c4145454fa8/0_62_5115_3069/master/5115.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6d4a904c6f57c00b5a77306cb7a3b30", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
