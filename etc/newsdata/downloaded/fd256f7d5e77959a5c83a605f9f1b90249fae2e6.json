Samsung says the new speaker can control IoT devices, it integrates with Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform, and it uses sound technology provided by Samsung\u2019s AKG audio brand. SamMobile was first to spot the announcement.\n\nThis is the first time Samsung has officially admitted that its smaller smart speaker exists, although we had a decent idea it was coming, thanks to its appearance in a Federal Communications Commission filing earlier this year. Beyond the few details shared by Samsung in the beta announcement, we know next to nothing about this new device. We don\u2019t even know for sure whether the speaker is battery powered, for example. Presumably, we\u2019ll find out when Samsung decides to officially announce the speaker, although it\u2019s unclear if this will happen before or after beta testers get their hands on it.\n\nWhat\u2019s also notable here is that Samsung\u2019s announcement appears to omit any mention of the original Galaxy Home smart speaker that it announced alongside the Note 9 last year. Samsung\u2019s full-size smart speaker has faced continual delays since its announcement. Originally planned for a release in the first half of this year, the company delayed the speaker until the third quarter of this year, and it most recently said that it\u2019s working to \u201crefine and enhance\u201d it before release.", "description": "Samsung has quietly announced a new Bixby-powered smart speaker called the Galaxy Home Mini.
