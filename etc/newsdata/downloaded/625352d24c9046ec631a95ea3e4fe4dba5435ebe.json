But if you needed a quick recap, here it is.\n\nEthereum\u2019s creators wanted to build a platform that would allow users all over the world to write decentralized applications, and use the Ethereum blockchain as a \u201cworld computer.\u201d\n\nThe decentralized platform made smart contracts a key part of the blockchain conversation, and demonstrated to the world how blockchain technology can be used for more than just cryptocurrency.\n\nIt sounds great, but bringing the Ethereum vision to life is proving difficult for its community of supporters and developers.\n\nOne of the most contentious topics of the moment for the platform and one of its creators, Vitalik Buterin, is the transition to ETH 2.0. The series of updates and improvements designed to make the Ethereum platform faster and more reliable will not be implemented overnight. It\u2019s going to be a long process, that\u2019s due to commence next year, but won\u2019t be complete for many more months.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s founding members, Joseph Lubin, has said that the updates should make Ethereum far more scalable within the next 24 months. But of course, a lot has to fall into place for that fact to be realized.\n\nBefore we take a look at how Ethereum has performed in the third quarter of the year, let\u2019s remind ourselves how things went down in Q2.\n\nQ2 performance recap\n\nIn terms of trading price, Ethereum had a solid second quarter.\n\nAt the start of April, Ethereum experienced a rally which saw its price increase by 27 percent from $139 to $177. Unfortunately, this uptick in price was short-lived \u2014 by the end of April a market correction pulled Ethereum\u2019s trading price down to $150.\n\nThankfully, the correction didn\u2019t have a lasting effect on Ethereum, and over the course of May the digital coin showed nothing but steady growth. Over the four weeks of May, ETH\u2018s price increased a whopping 95 percent, topping out at just over $271 per coin.\n\nCredit: eToro End of Q2 Ethereum performance\n\nOver the final month of Q2, Ethereum continued to grow. It didn\u2019t show the same pace it had shown a month earlier, but by the end of June, Ethereum was up on where it was at the start of the month. As it happened, Ethereum reached its quarterly high trading price ($335) in June.\n\nOver the course of the quarter, Ethereum\u2018s trading price rose 114 percent. Not too shabby if you\u2019re holding on to ETH tokens for the long run.\n\nEthereum/USD Q3\n\nDespite having a stellar Q2 and ending the previous quarter on a high, the same cannot be said for the digital coin\u2018s Q3 performance.\n\nFrom the first day of the quarter Ethereum\u2018s price has proceeded on a steady downward trajectory.\n\nEthereum opened Q3 trading at around $285. The coin held steady around this price during the first week of the quarter. It even saw a 7.7 percent increase on July 8 as its price rose to $307 per token.\n\nCredit: eToro Early Q3 Ethereum performance chart\n\nUnfortunately, that would be as good as it got for Ethereum at the start of Q3. By the third week of July its price started tumbling, a trend seen across a host of other cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.\n\nBy July 16, Ethereum hit $202, the lowest trading price for the whole month. This is a painful 34-percent drop over the high it saw in the first week of the month.\n\nCredit: eToro Ethereum mid-Q3 performance\n\nThe cryptocurrency showed no signs of rallying to better things as it progressed into the middle of Q3. Over the entire month of August, ETH continued to drop in value.\n\nThere was a small uptick in trading price at the start of the month which saw Ethereum\u2018s price grow from $211 to around $231, a 9.5-percent increase.\n\nHowever, the decentralized token went into free fall for the rest of month.\n\nAt the end of August, ETH was trading for $166 per coin, a 28-percent drop from the high it saw at the start of month. Thinking back to the $307 quarterly high seen in July, at the end of August the token had decreased by 46 percent in price.\n\n\n\nCredit: eToro Ethereum Q3 performance chart\n\nDespite a slow and steady price rally over the first two weeks of September, the last month of the quarter proved to be just as cruel a mistress as the first two.\n\nEthereum opened September trading at a hair over $168. Over the next two and a half weeks, its price grew steadily eventually reaching $217, a 30 percent increase.\n\nOverall Q3 performance for Ethereum\n\nUnfortunately, the coin\u2018s price didn\u2019t continue to grow or make up for its poor performance at the start of the quarter. The 30 percent increase seen in the middle of the month was erased almost immediately as Ethereum\u2018s price dropped on September 20, it eventually settled at $162 a few days later.\n\nMajor events in Q3 for Ethereum\n\nPerhaps Ethereum\u2018s sub-par performance in Q3 was a result of the lack of positive news for Buterin\u2019s baby.\n\nIn August, Vitalik Buterin warned the community that his blockchain was \u201calmost full,\u201d and that a lack of scalability is proving to be a consistent bottleneck. Ultimately, it seems that keeping organizations from joining the network, isn\u2019t good for adoption.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, research from cloud service provider Chainstack showed that over half of Ethereum nodes are running on cloud computing services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThat\u2019s incredibly shaky news for a platform that positions itself as \u201cdecentralized.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, in early September Ethereum overtook Bitcoin in terms of daily fees. Perhaps a sign that Ethereum is struggling to deal with the volume of users.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not all bad news for the so-called \u201cworld computer.\u201d Dapp developers still love Ethereum, even if it is lagging behind in active users, according to Dapp Radar.\n\nThere was also some good news for traders, as eToro announced the addition of five Ethereum-based tokens to its professional trading platform, eToro X. It also said it has plans to add a further 115 in the future.\n\nLooking ahead to Q4 and beyond\n\nThe start of Q4 is already looking more positive for Ethereum \u2014 within the first two weeks of October Ethereum\u2019s price reached $195.\n\nA small market correction saw Ethereum\u2018s price drop back down to trade between $160 and $180 for the following week.\n\nThe future of Buterin\u2019s platform hangs in the balance, though. News that its blockchain is struggling to deal with demands on its resources means the future looks uncertain at best.\n\nAccording to a CoinDesk report published in Q3, Ethereum is facing challenges on all fronts. It doesn\u2019t just have to address its scalability woes, it also has to consider its future as money.\n\nHowever, investors don\u2019t seem to be immediately worried about Ethereum\u2018s short term future. It seems Buterin and co have doing enough to keep traders interested, for now.\n\nWith every passing week, we get closer to the planned launch of ETH 2.0. How that affects the long term functionality of the platform though, remains to be seen. But it might be time to grab the popcorn, because Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 are going to be interesting.", "description": "Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum had a great second quarter of this year, but the same cannot be said of Q3.
