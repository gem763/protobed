A deal may involve help with SAA's chronic debt problem, with banks withholding further loans until the airline can present a repayment plan for R9.2bn ($611m) of borrowings.\n\nSAA hasn't yet appointed a permanent replacement for Jarana.\n\nThe parlous financial state of South Africa's weak state-owned enterprises is weighing on the economy, with Finance Minister Tito Mboweni having little choice but to allocate additional funds to debt-ridden companies, from power utility Eskom to the South African Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nEthiopian is Africa\u2019s biggest aviation success story, with main rivals SAA and Kenya Airways struggling with losses and relying on government support. The Horn of Africa carrier has looked to invest in other airlines around the continent, including new carriers planned for Ghana and Zambia.\n\n\"We have recently signed a shareholders agreement with the Ghanaian government,\" Tewolde said.\n\n\"Hopefully it will be up and running in the next six months\".\n\nCutting Routes\n\nIn contrast, SAA is cutting routes and needs R2bn alone to fund working capital for the remainder of its financial year through March 2020. The airline has been held back by mismanagement and corruption, particularly during the scandal-hit presidential tenure of Jacob Zuma.\n\nAfrican operators now have 20% of the continent's market compared with 60% two decades ago, mainly due to the growth of Gulf-based carriers, Tewolde said.\n\n\"It's a continuous decline,\" Tewolde said.\n\n\"If it is not addressed by African carriers -- it may become zero. If that happens it means we are all wiped out\".\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Nizar Manek", "description": "While the ruling African National Congress has said it would consider selling equity in the South African Airways, there's been no visible strategy for such a plan, said Tewolde Gebre Mariam, the chief executive officer of Ethiopian Airlines.", "authors": ["John Bowker"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9380/430061396626494a95d1649ded927070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
