Noriega Closes a chapter in our history; his daughters and their families deserve a burial in peace'\n\nNoriega, who spied for the CIA before his drug trafficking and brutal regime sparked a US invasion in 1989, initially served a 17-year drug sentence in America and was later sent to face charges in France.\n\nThe final years of his life were spent in a Panamanian prison for murder of political opponents during his 1983-89 regime.\n\nHe accused Washington of a 'conspiracy' to keep him behind bars and tied his legal troubles to his refusal to cooperate with a US plan aimed at toppling Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government in the 1980s.\n\nIn recent years Noriega suffered various ailments including high blood pressure and bronchitis.\n\nIn 2016, doctors detected the rapid growth of a benign brain tumor that had first been spotted four years earlier, and in the following January a court granted him house arrest to prepare for surgery on the tumor.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Felicidad and daughters Lorena, Thays and Sandra.\n\nFollowing Noriega's ouster Panama underwent huge changes, taking over the Panama Canal from US control in 1999, vastly expanding the waterway and enjoying a boom in tourism and real estate.\n\nPanamanian police officers enter the emergency section of the Santo Tomas Hospital in Panama City this morning\n\nMugshots years apart: Noriega, in a mugshot left in Miami in 1990 and right December 2011, taken at El Renacer penitentiary\n\nNoriega arrives at Renacer prison, south east of Panama City, in December 2011; He was sent to France in 2010 and convicted in money laundering charges. The following year he was extradited to Panama where he was sentenced for disappearance of political opponents\n\nToday the Central American nation has little in common with the bombed-out neighborhoods where Noriega hid during the 1989 invasion, before being famously smoked out of his refuge at the Vatican Embassy by incessant, loud rock music blared by U.S. troops.\n\nKnown mockingly as 'Pineapple Face' for his pockmarked complexion, Manuel Antonio Noriega was born poor in Panama City on February 11, 1934, and was raised by foster parents.\n\nHe joined Panama's Defense Forces in 1962 and steadily rose through the ranks, mainly through loyalty to his mentor, General Omar Torrijos, who became Panama's de facto leader after a 1968 coup.\n\nFROM DICTATOR TO DETAINEE: NORIEGA'S TURBULENT PAST The late Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who rose to power while working for the CIA, ruled ruthlessly 1983-1989 and was ousted by a US military invasion. Noriega, 83, died late Monday in a Panama City hospital as he was recovering from surgery to remove a brain tumor. Here are some notable moments of Noriega's life: February 11, 1934: Noriega is born to a poor family in Panama City's Guachimango district. He goes on to graduate from a military academy in Peru and embarks on a military career. 1968: Participates in a coup that ousts president Arnulfo Arias, and backs popular strongman general Omar Torrijos. Around this time Noriega reportedly goes onto the CIA's payroll. Torrijos makes him chief of Panama's military intelligence. 1983: Noriega takes command of the National Guard and becomes Panama's de facto ruler, two years after Torrijos dies in a mysterious plane crash. December 20, 1989: US forces invade Panama to oust Noriega, accusing him of drug trafficking. Noriega takes refuge in the Vatican embassy for 10 days, then surrenders to the US soldiers, who take him to the United States. 1992: A US court sentences Noriega to 40 years prison for drug trafficking. The sentence is later cut to 17 years. April 2010: Noriega is extradited to France, where he faces charges of laundering $3 million from the Medellin drug cartel through French banks. July 2010: A French court sentences Noriega to seven years in prison. December 11, 2011: France extradites Noriega to Panama, where he was sentenced in absentia to three 20-year prison sentences for the murder of opponent Hugo Spadafora and military commander Moises Giroldi, and for killing rebellious soldiers trying to overthrow him in what became known as the Albrook massacre. January 28, 2017: A Panama court agrees to temporarily release Noriega to house arrest to prepare for surgery to remove a benign brain tumor. The ex-dictator's family and lawyers say he has suffered strokes, respiratory problems, prostate cancer and depression. March 7, 2017: Doctors remove the brain tumor, but complications lead to cerebral bleeding. Following a second operation doctors put him in an induced coma. May 29, 2017: Noriega dies at the San Tomas public hospital.\n\nAs Torrijos' intelligence chief, Noriega monitored political opponents and developed close ties with U.S. intelligence agencies guarding against possible threats to the canal.\n\nTwo years after Torrijos died in a mysterious plane crash in 1981, Noriega became the head of the armed forces and Panama's de facto ruler.\n\nNoriega ruled with an iron fist, ordering the deaths of those who opposed him and maintaining a murky, close and conflictive relationship with the United States.\n\nAt the apex of his power he wielded great influence outside the country as well thanks to longstanding relationships with spy agencies around the world, said R.M. Koster, an American novelist and biographer of Noriega who has lived in Panama for decades.\n\nUS soldiers secure a position outside the Vatican embassy in Panama City when Noriega was seeking asylum during Operation Just Cause, on December 24, 1989. He only surrendered when the Americans played loud rock music for days\n\nMerry christmas! The US invaded in an attempt to remove Noriega and bring him to the US for trial on drug charges; Noriega was extradited to the US and spent nearly 20 years in prison in Florida after being convicted on drug trafficking charges\n\nUS troops patrol the streets and clear debris in the area of the Panamanian Defense Force headquarters in Panama City during Operation Just Cause, on December 26, 1989\n\nNoriega was considered a valued CIA asset and was paid millions of dollars for assistance to the U.S. throughout Latin America, including acting as a liaison to Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\n\nNoriega also helped the US seize drugs at sea and track money laundering in Panama's banks, and reported on guerrilla and terrorist activities.\n\nWashington ultimately soured on him, especially after a top political opponent was killed in 1985 and Noriega appeared to join forces with Latin American drug traffickers.\n\nFoes in the Panamanian military attempted several coups but failed, and their leaders were summarily executed by firing squad.\n\nWith the knowledge of U.S. officials, Noriega had formed 'the hemisphere's first narcokleptocracy,' a U.S. Senate subcommittee report said, calling him, 'the best example in recent U.S. foreign policy of how a foreign leader is able to manipulate the United States to the detriment of our own interests.'\n\nThe beginning of his downfall came in 1988 when federal grand juries in the Florida cities of Miami and Tampa indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking charges.\n\nInitially he reacted with defiance, thumbing his nose at US economic sanctions designed to drive him from power. He famously waved a machete at a rally while vowing not to leave, and in 1989 he nullified elections that observers say were handily won by the opposition.\n\nNoriega (pictured in 1989) helped the US seize drugs at sea and track money laundering in Panama's banks, and reported on guerrilla and terrorist activities\n\nWashington ultimately soured on Noriega (pictured in 1989), especially after a top political opponent was killed in 1985 and Noriega appeared to join forces with Latin American drug traffickers\n\nUS President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion in December 1989, and Noriega was captured and taken to Miami.\n\nDuring the operation, 23 US military personnel died and 320 were wounded, and the Pentagon estimated 200 Panamanian civilians and 314 soldiers were killed.\n\nProsecutors accused Noriega of helping Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel ship 'tons and tons of a deadly white powder' to the United States.\n\nThe defense cited court documents describing him as the 'CIA's man in Panama' and argued that the indictment 'smells all the way from here to Washington.'\n\nJurors convicted Noriega in April 1992 of eight of 10 charges. Under the judge's instructions, they were told not to consider the political side of the case - including whether the U.S. had the right to invade Panama and bring Noriega to trial in the first place.\n\nDuring his years at a minimum-security federal prison outside Miami, Noriega got special POW treatment, allowed to wear his Panamanian military uniform and insignia when in court.\n\nHe lived in a bungalow apart from other inmates and had his own television and exercise equipment. He was said to be a TV news junkie and a voracious reader about politics and current events.\n\nAfter completing his 17-year sentence in 2007, Noriega was extradited to France and received a seven-year sentence for money laundering.\n\nDespite amassing great wealth, Noriega had worked hard to cultivate an image of a man of the people\n\nFILE - In this July 5, 1986 file photo, Miss USA, Christy Fichtner, left, and Miss Panama, Gilda Garcia Lopez, salute while flanking General Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama City.

'You may think what you like of Noriega, but we can't say he was anything but respectful toward his neighbors.'\n\n'The humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost authority,' Noriega said in one speech.\n\nWhile some resentment lingers over the U.S. invasion, Noriega has so few supporters in modern-day Panama that attempts to auction off his old home attracted no bidders and the government decided to demolish decaying building down.\n\nLate in life, the ex-dictator essentially had zero influence over his country from behind bars.\n\nManuel Noriega watches as U.S. Drug Enforcement Agents place chains around his waist aboard a C-130 transport plane in 1990\n\nManuel Noriega lived in a modest, two-story home in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Panama City that stood in stark contrast with the opulent mansions customary among Latin American dictators. He is pictured with his daughter\n\nNoriega (right) is pictured ahead of going on trial in Paris, France in 2010 accused of using French bank accounts to launder bribes from a Colombian cocaine cartel in the late 1980s\n\n'He is not a figure with political possibilities,' University of Panama sociologist Raul Leis said in 2008.\n\n'Even though there's a small sector that yearns for the Noriega era, it is not a representative figure in the country.'\n\nIn 2014, Noriega reportedly sued the makers of the computer game Call Of Duty after they named a treacherous character Manuel Noriega and also referred to him as Old Pineapple Face.\n\nNoriega broke a long silence in June 2015 when he made a statement from prison on Panamanian television in which he asked forgiveness of those harmed by his regime.\n\n'I feel like as Christians we all have to forgive,' he said, reading from a handwritten statement. 'The Panamanian people have already overcome this period of dictatorship.'\n\nBut for the most part Noriega stayed mum about elite military and civilian associates who thrived on the corruption that he helped instill - and which still plagues the Central American nation of some 3.9 million people, a favored transshipment point for drugs and a haven for money laundering.\n\n'He kept his mouth shut and died for the sins of others,' Koster, the biographer, said in a 2014 interview. 'Nobody else ever went to prison.'\n\nMeanwhile, families of more than 100 who were killed or disappeared during his rule are still seeking justice.", "description": "Manuel Noriega, the former military ruler of Panama who was ousted by a US invasion in 1989, has died aged 83.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/30/08/40EDE16800000578-0-image-a-21_1496128307020.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-30"}
