A veil sprouted from her black bob. Moments before the wedding began, she stood quietly on a staircase, waiting to descend to the ceremony.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d she thought. \u201cI\u2019m really doing this.\u201d\n\nThis was no conventional wedding to join two people in matrimony. Instead, a group of nearly 30 friends gathered in a banquet room in one of Tokyo\u2019s most fashionable districts last year to witness Sanae Hanaoka, 31, as she performed a public declaration of her love \u2013 for her single self.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

But by 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available, that had changed drastically, with one in seven women remaining unmarried by that age.\n\nAnd for women aged 35 to 39, the percentage was even higher: nearly a quarter had never been married, compared with only about 10 per cent two decades earlier.\n\nThe change is so striking that a growing number of businesses now cater to singles, and to single women in particular. There are single karaoke salons featuring women-only zones, restaurants designed for solo diners, and apartment complexes that target women looking to buy or rent homes on their own. Travel companies book tours for single women, and photo studios offer sessions in which women can don wedding dresses and pose for solo bridal portraits.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018If I get married, I will just have to do more housework,\u2019\u201d says Kayoko Masuda, 49, a single cartoonist who stops by to croon in private at a One Kara solo karaoke salon in Tokyo. A separate section is cordoned off for women, behind sliding doors marked \u201cLadies Only\u201d.\n\n\u201cI loved my job, and I wanted to be free to do it,\u201d she says of her unmarried status.\n\nLast year, the number of couples getting married hit the lowest level since the end of the Second World War, according to government estimates. It was the sixth straight year of decline in the nation\u2019s marriage rate, which is falling at a much faster clip than the drop in Japan\u2019s population overall.\n\nNot surprisingly, the number of births in Japan \u2013 a country where few people have children out of wedlock \u2013 is also tumbling. Last year, the number of babies born in the country fell to the lowest level since at least 1899, when record-keeping began.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Close to 70 per cent of women aged 15 to 64 now have jobs \u2013 a record. But their careers are often held back by a relentless tide of domestic burdens, like filling out the meticulous daily logs required by their children\u2019s daycare centres, preparing the intricate meals often expected of Japanese women, supervising and signing off on homework from school and after-school tutoring sessions, or hanging rounds of laundry \u2013 because few households have electric dryers.\n\nWhile some men say they want to pitch in more and the government has urged businesses to reform the crushing work culture, employees are still expected to devote most of their waking hours to the company, making it difficult for many husbands to participate much on the home front.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious for a lot of women who have jobs that it\u2019s very difficult to find a man who is available to be a caretaker in the family,\u201d says Kumiko Nemoto, a professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies.\n\nJapan\u2019s consumption-oriented culture also means that single women with careers and money have a wide range of activities and emotional outlets that their mothers or grandmothers did not, Nemoto adds. And, notably, Japanese women no longer need husbands to ensure their economic security.\n\n\u201cOne reason to get married for a woman is to have a stable financial life,\u201d sats Miki Matsui, 49, a director at a Tokyo publishing house. \u201cI don\u2019t have any worries about being alone with myself or any financial worries. So I did not have to chase myself into a corner and choose marriage for financial reasons.\u201d\n\nFor some single women, their married friends with children serve as cautionary tales.\n\nShigeko Shirota, 48, who works as an administrator at a preschool and lives in a condominium she bought herself, says many of her married friends stay home with their children and get little help from their husbands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for women to have to be stuck in their homes as housewives,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are happy as long as they are with their kids, but some of them just describe their husbands as a big baby. They don\u2019t really like having to take care of their husbands.\u201d\n\nSinglehood has freed Shirota to travel extensively and pursue her hobbies. She has enrolled in jewellery-making classes and is an avid Irish dancer. Last summer, she competed as a dancer in Ireland and then took her mother on a trip to China. A couple of years ago, she went on a luxury cruise on the Queen Elizabeth line and booked a stateroom for herself.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to rely on men anymore,\u201d Shirota says.\n\nOn a recent evening, she joined five other women at an Irish dancing lesson in a studio tucked on an upper floor of a department store in a Tokyo suburb. As the group practised jigs and reels, Shirota glided across the wood floor with piston-sharp kicks and precise steps.\n\nAfter class, the women ordered tea and sandwiches at a restaurant a few floors down. Shirota pulled out her phone to show pictures of her summer trip to Ireland. One classmate, a married mother of three teenagers, reminisced about a family trip there years earlier, lamenting how she had not returned because of the prohibitive cost of airline tickets for a family of five.\n\nSome men are reacting to Japan\u2019s economic realities by shying away from marriage as well. Ever since Japan\u2019s speculative stock and property bubble burst in the early 1990s, wages have flatlined. The long-held social compact between employers and workers \u2013 in which few people were ever laid off and employees were guaranteed lifelong employment \u2013 has diminished. About one-fifth of men are now consigned to irregular contract jobs that offer little stability or potential for advancement.\n\nWith the social expectation that men should be the primary breadwinners, many men worry they will struggle to support a household financially. Just over a third of men aged 35 to 39 have never been married, up from less than a quarter 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cNowadays, men\u2019s wages are not growing, so they don\u2019t make enough to support their own families,\u201d says Kazuhisa Arakawa, a senior director at a marketing firm who wrote Super-Solo Society and The Rise of the Solo Economy.\n\nArakawa, who came of age in the late-bubble years and is single, says many of his male peers view marriage as an encumbrance.\n\nOf course, matters of the heart do not strictly conform to economic conditions. Remaining single is often less of a deliberate stance than a reflection that the urgency to get married has diminished in today\u2019s society, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe data suggests very few women look at the lay of the land and say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to marry,\u2019\u201d says James Raymo, a professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has written extensively about marriage in Japan. Rather, he says, they \u201cpostpone and postpone and wait for the right circumstances, and then those circumstances never quite align and they drift into lifelong singlehood\u201d.\n\nKaori Shibuya, 42, had a long-term relationship in her 20s that didn\u2019t work out and then met a marriage prospect through a matchmaker in her 30s. But there was no chemistry. She has dated occasionally since then.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have chosen a path,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have had all these chances along the way.\u201d\n\nShibuya, who lives with her widowed mother, says some women choose marriage because they feel vulnerable on their own. But she started her own business two years ago \u2013 a cafe \u2013 and is confident she can support herself.\n\nAs a child, Shibuya says, her parents\u2019 relationship looked idyllic. \u201cBut now as an adult, I look back and realise maybe she had to bear many burdens,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the older generations, husbands were the bosses of the family and the wives were obedient and in a weaker position.\u201d\n\nWomen who are not interested in having children often see little point in marriage. Though single motherhood is on the rise in Japan, it is largely due to divorce rather than women choosing to have children on their own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too much of an exaggeration to say that people in Japan get married because they want to have kids,\u201d says Mary C Brinton, a professor of sociology at Harvard University who focuses on contemporary Japan. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to have kids, there are fewer reasons to get married in Japan.\u201d\n\nBeing single comes with trade-offs, too. Hanaoka, the woman who held a solo wedding last year, shares a ramshackle house on the outskirts of Tokyo with two roommates. When loneliness creeps in, she pulls up the video of her ceremony to remind her of the people who support and love her.\n\nHanaoka also recalls that, when she was growing up, her mother often seemed unhappy. Then, after college, she taught kindergarten, giving her a firsthand look at how many mothers seemed to be \u201ctrying too hard to take care of their own children, but not taking care of themselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf I become a mother,\u201d Hanaoka says, \u201cI am afraid that I will be expected to act in the mother role that is demanded by Japanese society, rather than being myself.\u201d\n\nShe has dated on and off, lives frugally and, relishing her freedom, took a trip to Mexico last autumn.\n\n\u201cI would rather do what I want to do right now,\u201d she says.\n\n\u00a9 New York Times\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
