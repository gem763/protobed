But the proposed definition of antisemitism is so wide that, in addition to standard protections against hate speech towards Jews, it would also prohibit debate about the human rights violations of the Israeli government.\n\nFirst amendment advocates see the potential spread of such laws as a major threat to free speech on campuses.\n\nAmong the activities that would be prohibited by the new laws are human rights investigations focusing specifically on Israel. Also banned would be any speech \u201cdemonizing Israel by \u2026 blaming Israel for all inter-religious or political tensions\u201d or \u201cdelegitimizing Israel by \u2026 questioning Israel\u2019s right to exist\u201d.\n\nThe push began at a conference in August held by the American Legislative Exchange Council, Alec, a conservative network which has a long history of propagating rightwing policies at state level through model bills. The group, dubbed a \u201cbill mill\u201d, has spearheaded attacks on trade unions, opposition to Obamacare, voter suppression measures and legislation blocking efforts to address the climate crisis.\n\nThe meeting at Alec is disclosed in emails obtained under a freedom of information request by David Armiak, research director for the watchdog Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) and shared with the Guardian. They show that several Republican state lawmakers joined pro-Israeli lobbyists in Austin, Texas, to discuss disseminating new restrictions on speech relating to Israel on campuses across the heartlands.\n\nThe private meeting was led by Randy Fine, a Republican from Florida who was instrumental in passing in May the first state law outlawing antisemitism in public education. A week later he emailed fellow participants under the subject line: Anti-Semitism Bill Discussed at Alec.\n\nFine has faced controversy in the past over his aggressive opposition to public debate about Israel. Earlier this year he called a local Jewish constituent a \u201cJudenrat\u201d because the man had attended a forum titled: Palestine/Israel, Opening the Dialogue.\n\nThe term \u201cJudenrat\u201d was the name for Nazi-mandated councils in Jewish ghettos during the second world war and has been used to refer to Jews who collaborated with the Nazis.\n\nAlso attending the meeting at Alec were lawmakers from South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as representatives of two pro-Israel lobbying groups. \u201cIt was great to see you at the Alec conference last week in Austin and to briefly share the work we did in passing HB 741, the strongest antisemitism bill ever passed in the United States,\u201d Fine wrote to them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former governor of Florida Jeb Bush speaks at the American Legislative Exchange Council in 2013.

Spencer Green/Associated Press\n\nThe Florida Republican encouraged peers in other state assemblies to work with one of the lobbying groups, the Israeli-American Coalition for Action, which he said had been \u201cinstrumental in providing outside support as I pushed the bill\u201d. In a separate email to the group, IAC for Action\u2019s Joseph Sabag said that he and his legal team had taken Fine\u2019s Florida bill and \u201crefined it into a model that can be brought elsewhere. I urge you to contact me or Rep Alan Clemmons and take advantage of our policy support if you are considering filing a bill.\u201d\n\nClemmons is Alec\u2019s national chairman. A Republican representative from South Carolina, he introduced a similar antisemitism definition into a budget bill in his state in 2018.\n\nSabag told the Guardian that it would be incorrect to suggest that IAC for Action was encouraging state lawmakers to adopt the definition. He said his organization \u201cprovides legal analysis and policy resources in response to requests from legislators who wish to draw upon our subject matter expertise. Antisemitism is a hot issue right now, so of course there are many who are naturally interested.\u201d\n\nHe also denied that Alec was involved in the legislative push. \u201cNo such bills have been presented to them for model consideration, and they\u2019ve held no policy discussions on the matter or taken any position.\u201d\n\nThe emails seen by the Guardian, he said, \u201cemerged out of an after-hours private gathering of friends and colleagues, not an Alec function and Alec held no such forum or discussion at its conference\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian asked Alec to comment, but received no reply.\n\nThe emails give a clear indication of the motive behind the push for antisemitism bills \u2013 countering criticism of Israel on campuses.\n\nFine writes that under the new laws \u201cantisemitism (whether acts by students, administrators or faculty, policies and procedures, club organizations etc) [will] be treated identically as how racism is treated. Students for Justice in Palestine is now treated the same way as the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 as they should be.\u201d\n\nStudents for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is a leading pro-Palestinian student activist group that campaigns in at least 80 campuses for an international boycott of Israel in protest at its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. It has been at the forefront of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement in the US that has already prompted a number of states to pass new laws penalizing such boycotts of Israel to the dismay of free speech advocates.\n\nSabag was asked by the Guardian about the comparison drawn by Fine between SJP and the violent white supremacist group the KKK. He said: \u201cSJP is one of America\u2019s most prominent anti-Israel propaganda groups and has material connections to organizations designated by the US justice department as terrorism co-conspirators. In the course of promoting BDS, or national-origin based discrimination against Israel, SJP members typically employ classic antisemitic themes and blood libels.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThey also employ gross misrepresentations of Zionism, Israel\u2019s Jewish national character and government policies. This messaging strategy aims to facilitate the development of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish perspectives among unsuspecting and unknowledgable audiences.\u201d\n\nRaphael Eissa, a National SJP Steering Committee member, dismissed Sabag\u2019s depiction. He said that SJP was a \u201can independent grassroots network of everyday students and recent alum\u201d that regularly endures \u201ccoordinated fear mongering campaigns and racist PR tactics\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to a student member of SJP at University of California, Berkeley who insisted on anonymity because of the harassment she had experienced on campus. Last November she was one of the SJP organizers of a vigil to mourn jointly the 11 Jewish victims of the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in \u2013 the deadliest attack against Jews in America \u2013 and three Palestinian children who were killed that same October weekend from an Israeli airstrike.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man pauses at the memorials set up for each of the 11 people killed at the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Photograph: Jared Wickerham/EPA\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make a statement about solidarity between our two communities, that we were all in mourning,\u201d said the student, describing herself as an anti-Zionist Jew from a strongly Zionist family background.\n\nAfter SJP advertised the vigil on its Facebook page, the student said she came under a barrage of attacks on social media accusing her of being antisemitic. She said she found the charge upsetting and ironic.\n\n\u201cAs a Jewish student, I deeply care about antisemitism because it affects me and my family personally, and because it informs my concern about oppression of Jews and Palestinians and all people \u2013 it\u2019s why I do what I do.\u201d\n\nIn the face of such opprobrium, the Berkeley branch of SJP cancelled the public vigil and held it privately off-campus.\n\nThe push for new state laws comes at a time of increasing antisemitic attacks in the US and around the world. The latest FBI figures for 2017 recorded a 37% increase on the previous year in antisemitic hate crimes in the US, up to 938 incidents. Other databases put the figure substantially higher.\n\nIn the context of this rising violence, much of the text of the Florida antisemitism bill is non-contentious. It outlaws a number of anti-Jewish tropes such as \u201caccusing Jews as a people of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust\u201d.\n\nBut critics say such uncontroversial material sits alongside clauses in the bill that would censor debate on Israeli government action.\n\nLiz Jackson, a staff attorney with Palestine Legal that represents campaigners for Palestinian rights in the US who is herself Jewish, said: \u201cIt\u2019s riding off the universally agreed idea that antisemitism is bad and must be stopped at a time of a frightening resurgence in white supremacist violence. It\u2019s extremely cynical to masquerade as fighting antisemitism when you are, in fact, shutting down criticism of Israel.\u201d\n\nThe clauses relating to Israel in the definition of antisemitism now being disseminated to several states emanates from a 2005 text from the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Ken Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate who was a lead drafter of the EUMC text, said it was intended to facilitate reporting of antisemitic attacks across Europe.\n\n\u201cIt was never intended to suppress discussion of ideas on campuses.\u201d\n\nStern said that attempts to silence opposition was happening on both sides of the Israel-Palestinian divide on US campuses. \u201cIt\u2019s a battlefield right now.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, he was concerned \u201cabout the attempt to curtail free speech among students \u2013 the whole idea is to encourage them to wrestle with new ideas, particularly those they find disturbing\u201d.\n\nSabag dismissed first amendment fears about the new antisemitism bills. \u201cTo suggest that such laws violate first amendment rights is an outright falsehood that serves the purposes of anti-Israel and antisemitic forces. The Florida law addresses criminal and discriminatory conduct that is not protected by the first amendment, and it includes explicit provisions that the law is not to be construed in any way that would violate free speech.\u201d", "description": "Documents seen by Guardian show fresh attack on university debate under the guise of prohibiting antisemitism", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b778e51aef2b3c0b2e3d995934249c042a534f/0_112_2465_1479/master/2465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c5f3b083202459420ea5e57801bd5e0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
