Pine Capital said it did so because it had \"received numerous allegations from various parties concerning the operations of ACPAM, including allegations in respect of (a) potential conflict of interest and possible lapses in internal control\".\n\nMr Tan sued the group, saying ACPAM's affairs had been conducted in a manner prejudicial to him. Pine Capital subsequently commenced its own legal proceedings against Mr Tan and other former directors and officers of ACPAM.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nUnder the settlement, the respective claims and counterclaims in the suits will be discontinued within seven days with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party, Pine Capital said.\n\nSettling the suits is in the best interest of the company, Pine Capital said, and will not be prejudicial to the interests of Pine Capital and its shareholders. The settlement is not expected to have any material impact on the group's financial performance.\n\nIn July 2017, Pine Capital, formerly known as OLS Enterprise, completed the acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in ACPAM, which is run by Mr Tan. Mr Tan had been financing OLS with a convertible bond programme.\n\nThereafter, OLS Enterprise was known as Pine Capital. Mr Tan was appointed a non-executive director of Pine Capital in August 2017, and redesignated as interim CEO and executive chairman on June 1, before he resigned in March.
