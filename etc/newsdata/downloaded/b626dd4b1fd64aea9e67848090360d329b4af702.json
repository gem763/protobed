'I mean, he used to be one of the coolest black dudes on Earth.\n\nThe latest: Saturday Night Live star Michael Che, 36, was at the center of transphobia-related criticism amid views following a Weekend Update segment on the show that referred to Caitlyn Jenner as a 'fella'\n\n'Now he's showing up to events in sweatpants and orthopedic sneakers, listening to Kenny G and trying to get black people to like Trump; it's like, how long before this guy changes his name to Kathy?'\n\nChe then referred to Jenner, who told Diane Sawyer about plans to transition in an April 2015 interview with ABC News, and emerged publicly as Caitlyn in a Vanity Fair interview two months later.\n\n'Now, you might think that I'm crazy,' Che said in the segment, which was accompanied by a shot of Caitlyn prior to her transition, when she was known as Bruce. 'But about five years ago, there was a fella named Bruce Jenner, and he moved to Calabasas \u2026'\n\nThe studio audience gave Che a mediocre reaction to the joke as his co-host Colin Jost noted, 'That's pretty much ended, yeah that's great,' while concealing his face.\n\nPremise: On the latest edition of the NBC comedy staple, Che made a reference to Jenner while speaking about Kanye West and his recent creative turns\n\nControversial: Che said of Caitlyn, 'Now, you might think that I'm crazy, but about five years ago, there was a fella named Bruce Jenner, and he moved to Calabasas \u2026 '\n\nFeedback: The studio audience gave Che a mediocre reaction to the joke as his co-host Colin Jost noted, 'That's pretty much ended, yeah that's great'\n\nOn Twitter, a number of users called out Che for the joke - and on the network to discipline him for his words.\n\n'Michael Che\u2019s transphobic and misogynist BS has to go,' one user wrote. 'It\u2019s awful and totally not funny. He obviously has nothing left in the tank.'\n\nAnother person wrote: 'Imagine deadnaming and misgendering a trans woman.. and implying that kanye west is trans because he's f***in weird? Literally where was the comedy in that michael che.'\n\nReactions: Fans took to Twitter with feedback to the sketch, most of it negative\n\nOne person implicated Jost as equally responsible for the stream of humor on the series.\n\n'Anyway colin jost and michael che (and other snl writers for sure, but they\u2019re the head writers actually delivering the weekend update jokes) are f***ing transphobic and it\u2019s consistent and i\u2019m fucking sick of it,' the user wrote.\n\nNot all were incensed with Che, as one user noted that former Weekend Update host Norm Macdonald also brought his fair share of controversial comedy to the desk.\n\n'Man, the people getting mad at Michael Che would have a f***ing aneurism watching a norm macdonald weekend update,' the user wrote.\n\nAmid the scrutiny of the hot button social issue, Caitlyn herself has taken an introspective approach in the way she says she views her time as Bruce, and how she would like others to see it moving forward.\n\n'I had a life for 65 years. OK?' Besides which, I liked Bruce. He was a good person. He did a lot in his life. Oh, \"He didn't even exist\" - yes he did exist!' she told The Guardian in May of 2017. 'He worked his butt off. He raised amazing kids. He did a lot of very, very good things and it's not like I just want to throw that away.'", "description": "On the latest edition of the NBC comedy staple, the New York City native, 36, made a reference to Jenner while speaking about Kanye West and his recent creative turns.", "authors": ["Adam S.
