Adam Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot who represents an Illinois district Trump won in 2016, tweeted on Sunday, \u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. \u2026 I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday was thundering through a new round of counter-punches against his opponents by hammering home the suggestion that they should be arrested and charged with treason and could launch a civil war \u2014 or a combination of those. His top foes were the whistleblower whose complaint launched the House\u2019s impeachment investigation and the congressman leading it, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\n\u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d Trump tweeted of Schiff on Monday in one of many presidential suggestions that his opponents should be investigated for operating under their constitutional duties and within the law.\n\nFact check: Treason is extremely narrowly defined, both in the nation\u2019s founding document and in federal law.\n\nThe Constitution states: \u201cTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d\n\nNote the word \u201conly.\u201d Treason occurs when a U.S. citizen, or a non-citizen on U.S. territory, wages war against the country or provides material support, not just sympathy, to a declared enemy of the United States.\n\nThat came after Trump tweeted a comment from the Rev. Robert Jeffress, pastor of the Southern Baptist megachurch First Baptist Dallas.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, it will cause a civil war-like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal,\u201d Jeffress said on Sunday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends Weekend,\u201d which Trump posted a few hours later.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Trump is warning that the Democrat-driven impeachment proceedings would spark a civil war, prompting outrage from a Republican congressman.", "authors": ["Laurie Kellman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/kinzinger-conservative-trump-civil-war-tweets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
