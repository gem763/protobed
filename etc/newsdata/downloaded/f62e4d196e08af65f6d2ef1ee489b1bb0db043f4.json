Figures suggest there are 200,000 hospital visits because of heart attacks in the UK each year, while there are around 800,000 annually in the US. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, occurs when the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and feeling weak and anxious. Heart attacks are commonly caused by coronary heart disease, which can be brought on by smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes. Treatment is usually medication to dissolve blots clots or surgery to remove the blockage. Reduce your risk by not smoking, exercising regularly and drinking in moderation. Heart attacks are different to a cardiac arrest, which occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, usually due to a problem with electrical signals in the organ.

Women everywhere should benefit from improved heart attack diagnosis.'\n\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said: 'It's extremely promising that bespoke blood tests for men and women could lead to better diagnosis of heart attacks.\n\n'But this progress in diagnosis needs to translate in to better treatment and improved heart attack survival chances for women.\n\n'We now need to dig deep into the complex reasons behind women having reduced access to investigations and treatment.\n\n'It's essential that health care professionals are aware of the inequalities in heart care for women, and that everyone can spot the symptoms of a heart attack. With more research, and greater awareness, we can close this heart attack gender gap.'", "description": "Edinburgh University scientists found that when women were assessed with a troponin blood test they were about half as likely as men to receive recommended heart attack treatments.", "authors": ["Ben Spencer Medical Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/19690318-0-image-a-15_1571053280349.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
