The victim has been identified as 52-year-old Veronica Abouchuk who went missing last year\n\nVeronica R. Abouchuk was last seen more than a year ago. Her body was found in April but she was only identified last week. She is pictured here with her daughter\n\nBrian Smith, 48, had already been indicted on eight counts for allegedly torturing, raping and killing Kathleen Jo Henry, 30, but has now admitted to a second murder as well\n\nAnchorage police identified that woman as Veronica Abouchuk.\n\nAnchorage Police Chief Justin Doll told reporters Abouchuk's family reported her missing in February, but he said she had last been seen by them in July 2018.\n\nA grand jury indicted Smith on Thursday on murder and evidence tampering charges in the death of Abouchuk.\n\nAccording to the bail memo, Alaska State Troopers earlier this year recovered a skull with a gunshot wound in an area near the location Smith later provided.\n\nIt was identified as Abouchuk, who was referred to by initials in the document.\n\nBrittany Dunlop, a deputy district attorney, addresses reporters on Thursday in Anchorage, Alaska.

Midtown is a section of Anchorage.\n\nDetectives reviewed the card and found 39 photos and 12 videos. The videos showed a man beating and strangling a woman, telling her to 'Just...die' and laughing.\n\nThe woman attacked had dark hair and was described as 'possibly Alaskan Native.'\n\nSmith's attorney, Dan Lowery, an assistant public defender, said earlier this week he does not comment on pending cases.\n\nThe Department of Law has asked that bond be set at $2 million.\n\nThe department said Smith poses a 'significant public safety risk' and it considers him a flight risk.\n\n'After he committed each murder, he dumped the body along the side of a road like unwanted trash,' the document states.\n\nSmith came to Alaska from South Africa about five years ago and became a naturalized U.S. citizen last month, according to the bail memo.\n\nSmith, 48, was arrested on October 8 after police linked him to a memory card found on the street that was labeled 'homicide at midtown Marriott'. The SD card allegedly contained 39 photos and 12 videos of the suspect brutally assaulting and strangling a woman in a hotel room\n\nPolice believe human remains found on a highway about 20 miles south of Anchorage on October 2 belonged to the woman who was murdered in the hotel room. Investigators are pictured at the scene where the remains were discovered\n\nPolice were tipped off to Smith after investigators recognized his unique accent on the videos from another investigation.\n\nPolice believe Smith (pictured with his wife in 2014) took all of the crime scene photos and videos himself. It is unclear whether he knew the victim beforehand\n\nPolice arrested Smith on October 8 at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport as he returned from a trip.\n\nPolice credit the woman who turned in the memory card for Smith\u2019s timely arrest.\n\nAn affidavit described in gruesome detail how the videos showed the victim being beaten on a hotel room floor as she attempted to fight back.\n\nThe footage showed the woman with long dark hair being strangled as her assailant stomped on her throat.\n\nHours later the videos showed the suspect carrying her body through the hotel parking lot in a white sheet and placing it in a pickup truck that matched one Smith shares with his wife.\n\nThe dozens of photos showed Henry lying naked on the hotel carpet with a bruised left eye, bloodied blue lips and red marks on her face.", "description": "Anchorage police announced Thursday that Brian Smith, left, is now the suspect in a second homicide.
