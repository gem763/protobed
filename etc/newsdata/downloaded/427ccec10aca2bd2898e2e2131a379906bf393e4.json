Courtesy Sedlec Ossuary\n\nThis isn't an outright photography ban. Instead, visitors who wish to take snapshots will need to get permission from the parish three days ahead of time.\n\nA major issue for the ossuary -- which is currently undergoing renovations that will help manage the flow of visitors to the site -- is the epidemic of inappropriate selfies.\n\nDespite signs in many languages asking guests to be polite and remember that the skeletons are still dead bodies, many tourists have removed bones from the walls, attempted to touch or kiss skeletons, put hats or sunglasses on skulls for photo purposes or committed other disrespectful acts.\n\nIn addition, preservation is crucial, since Kutn\u00e1 Hora's historic town center is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nRelated content Bali resort bans smartphone use by the pool\n\nThe nearby Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, both managed by the Sedlec parish and part of the UNESCO designation, will also be subject to the new photography guidelines.\n\nIt's as yet unclear what the new restrictions will entail beyond the three-day rule.\n\nSome popular sites around the world, like Mexico City's Casa Azul, the home of artist Frida Kahlo, charge an additional fee for visitors who want to take pictures.", "description": "The Sedlec Ossuary chapel in the Czech Republic town of Kutn\u00e1 Hora has become the latest attraction to clamp down on photography.\nThe chapel is known as the \"Church of Bones\" due to its unusual decor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190607134757-ossuary-tease-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
