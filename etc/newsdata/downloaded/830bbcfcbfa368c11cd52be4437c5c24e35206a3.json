AMERICA!\u201d\n\nThe 2017 BP Statistical Review of World Energy states that annual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have declined by 758 million metric tons since 2005, the largest decline of any country. The U.S. is the largest per-capita carbon emitter.\n\nSecond, the president asked, \u201cWho has dumped the most carbon into the air? CHINA!\u201d\n\nThird, he said, \u201c91% of the world\u2019s population are exposed to air pollution above the World Health Organization\u2019s suggested level. NONE ARE IN THE U.S.A.!\u201d\n\nFourth, Mr. Trump said the U.S. leads the world in energy production and, fifth, it has \u201cthe world\u2019s cleanest and safest air and water.\u201d\n\nThe sixth issue likely to be ignored, Mr. Trump said, is that \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 destructive \u2018environmental\u2019 proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?\u201d he asked.\n\nSeventh, Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cThe badly flawed Paris Climate Agreement protects the polluters, hurts Americans, and cost a fortune.
