But Barnett told the presenting duo that things were off from the start; from the mysterious way they met, to the horrifying discovery they made upon adopting her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Out of nowhere, we got a call from an adoption agency in Florida,\u2019 the father of three shared. \u2018[They said] \u201cWe have researched you, we know all about you, if you don\u2019t adopt her in 24 hours, we\u2019re putting her into care.\u201d\u2018\n\nThe father of three took Holly and Phil inside a real-life horror story today (Picture: ITV)\n\nPressured, Michael and his now-former wife Christine travelled to meet (and did eventually adopt) Natalia. But Michael shared with This Morning viewers that \u2018the alerts started before we got home.\u2019\n\n\u2018[Christine] shouted, it was one of those voices where you knew something was wrong,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Christine was white as a ghost. I looked down and Natalia, at age six, had full pubic hair.\u2019\n\nBut the Barnett\u2019s real-life horror story didn\u2019t end there. The US-native also shared a collection of traumatising events that their adopted daughter subjected them too.\n\nHolly and Phil were shocked to say the least at the harrowing tale (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018She used to put thumb tacks straight up on the stairs,\u2019 Barnett shared. \u2018We would find knives under her bed. I woke up in the middle of the night and [Natalia] was standing over my bed with a knife in her hand.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolly and Phil could only listen, dumb-founded as their guest revealed the breaking point came where Natalia actively tried to harm his three sons, when she would collect the things most precious to the boys \u2013 a cow toy, toy cars and homework \u2013 and would throw them into traffic whilst the family were crossing the street.\n\n\u2018Natalia would tell us coldly, \u201cI\u2019m trying to kill the boys,\u201d\u2018 he said.\n\nMichael and family were terrorised by their adopted daughter (Picture: ITV)\n\nLuckily, however, no-one was seriously harmed and the Barnett\u2019s would visit a series of doctors and therapists and discover that Natalia\u2019s real age was closer to 22 than it was to six years old. They had her birth certificate amended and when the family left America for Canada, they left their adopted daughter behind too, setting her up in her own flat.\n\nThe story isn\u2019t over yet, though, as Barnett himself could go to prison, after police discovered Natalia living on her own and are looking to charge both him and his ex-wife Christine with neglect.\n\n\u2018Fact is,\u2019 he said defending himself live on air. \u2018Natalia \u2013 three times in American court \u2013 has been educated and ruled to be an adult.\u2019\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays from 10.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
