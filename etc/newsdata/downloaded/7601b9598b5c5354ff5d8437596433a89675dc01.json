Castro said the migrants identify as \u201cmembers of the LGTBQ community\u201d who have been \u201cbeat up,\u201d and one is disabled.\n\n\u201cWe presented them to these border agents and said that they should not be \u2026 they should not be in Mexico,\u201d Castro said.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has chosen cruelty,\u201d Castro said. In a separate post, Castro accused Trump of purposefully \u201ckilling people.\u201d\n\nFor Donald Trump, the cruelty is the point. His immigration agenda has created the conditions on our border\u2014conditions only bound to get worse.

Before the policy was implemented, those border crossers would have been released into the interior of the country, forcing federal immigration officials to then find, detain, and deport them after being deemed ineligible for asylum.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
