One Test match in Apia and a consistent refusal to expand pro rugby to the islands does not provide a moral high ground.\"", "description": "The treatment of rugby's Pacific nations by northern hemisphere powerhouses borders on colonialism, NZR chairperson Brent Impey said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9474/15300fc6492e462fa73126d2e89d0c5e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
