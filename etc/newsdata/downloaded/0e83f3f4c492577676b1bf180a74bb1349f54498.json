In its findings, the organization found commutes are getting longer and more drivers are hitting the road during peak hours.\n\nOne study the report cited by Robert Half, found that nearly one-quarter of workers have even left a job due to a bad commute. With an estimate of 85.3 percent of workers commuting by car, that\u2019s a significant portion of people quitting over undesirable routes.\n\nTo get to the bottom of what makes a commute stressful, Sleep Help analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Allstate\u2019s America\u2019s Best Drivers Report. What the analysis found include populations migrating away from city centers, traffic congestion and impaired driver safety\u2014all of which, subsequently lengthen drive times.\n\nMan driver Truck. / Transportation Industry (iStock)\n\nSleep Help broke down its stress metric with the following factors: Population, average one-way commute time, average annual days with precipitation, relative collision likelihood and percentage of workers who drive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, researchers at Sleep Help found that major cities on the East and West Coasts had the most stressful commutes with long travel times, crowded roads and sometimes frequent rain. Cities in the Southwest had least stressful commutes\u2014which may have something to do with drier weather conditions and shorter commute times. Arizona appears on the list an astounding five times.\n\nHere are the most and least stressful cities for commuters, according to Sleep Help.\n\nCities with the most stressful commutes\n\nDetroit, Michigan, USA - streets of east side Detroit.\n\n1.
