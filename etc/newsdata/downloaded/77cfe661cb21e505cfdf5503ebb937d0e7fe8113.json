Rosen argues that we are in the middle of the fourth battle for the Constitution, which, like the previous three battles, has concerned the nature and scope of executive and congressional power.\n\n\u201cThe Battle for the Constitution\u201d is part of the ongoing expansion of The Atlantic\u2019s Ideas section. In the year since its launch, under editor Yoni Appelbaum\u2019s direction, Ideas has gone toe-to-toe with the country\u2019s top opinion pages by offering sharp perspectives, essays, and arguments that drive the national conversation. Ideas has quickly become a home for some of the top writing talent in the world\u2014led by Atlantic staff writers, with contributions from elected officials and leaders shaping every industry\u2014and a must-read for millions of readers.\n\nThe project\u2019s landing page features the National Constitution Center\u2019s Interactive Constitution, an educational platform which brings together the leading legal scholars in America from diverse perspectives to write about every clause of the Constitution, exploring areas of agreement and disagreement. It will also host the National Constitution Center\u2019s weekly podcast of constitutional debate, We the People, which convenes liberal and conservative scholars to discuss historical and constitutional issues in the news.\n\n###\n\nAbout The Atlantic\n\nFounded in 1857 and today one of the fastest growing media platforms in the industry, The Atlantic has throughout its history championed the power of big ideas and continues to shape global debate across print, digital, events, video, and audio platforms.
