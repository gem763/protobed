(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nIn fact, both of Prescott\u2019s TD passes in the first half went to players who were not on an NFL roster last season. Prescott hooked up with Devin White \u2014 who was cut by the Jets last July after he failed his physical \u2014 for Dallas\u2019 first TD of the Week 2 game. It was Smith\u2019s first regular-season score since the 2015 season.\n\nWitten scored touchdowns in back-to-back games in Weeks 13 and 14 in the 2017 season, but those were his only grabs in those games. So far through six quarters of football this season he\u2019s caught six passes and counting.\n\nIt was the 70th TD catch of Witten\u2019s career.\n\nIt was a tough 2018 season for Witten, who endured endless criticism of his shaky broadcasting chops on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d But it has been a terrific start to 2019 with Witten playing a notable role for the Cowboys so far.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys\u2019 37-year-old tight end has caught his second touchdown of the season in as many games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hFEUomFiNJVkP53RvxNeeQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTAuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tSr2pDdt1VVc_dz88qi__Q--~B/aD0yMzA5O3c9MzQ3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e7e2b550-d7f3-11e9-bf4b-d5ec89325688", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
