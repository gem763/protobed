We spend way less on a few streaming services than we would on a cable or satellite TV subscription in our area.\n\nWe didn't even initially buy Amazon Prime for its streaming service, but Prime Video quickly became one of our favorite membership perks. We have a long watchlist for ourselves on Prime Video and the options for our daughter seem to be never ending too. Prime Video has a great selection of TV shows including classics you'd remember from your own childhood and new Prime originals.\n\nWith so many options, you and your kids will never run out of things to watch.\n\nCheck out our list of the top 20 kids' TV shows on Prime Video.\n\n*Series descriptions are provided by Amazon and lightly edited for length. Seasons available are included in the description, though you can purchase any seasons not included in your Prime membership for an added fee.*", "description": "Amazon Prime Video has a great selection of kids TV shows from new original series to classics that you'll love to introduce to your kids.", "authors": ["Alicia Betz"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d728fa92e22af04e258fe85-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
