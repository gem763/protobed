D.C. police, D.C. Fire and DCRA.\n\nThe latter, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, serves as the eyes, ears and nose of the city\u2019s housing code, and the agency\u2019s careless handling of the above mentioned housing code violations could place the city government \u2014 that is, it\u2019s taxpayers \u2014 at risk for millions of dollars in liability.\n\nWhy? Two people died in a fired at 708 Kennedy on Aug. 18 when they couldn\u2019t get out the house, and a woman was hospitalized because of the blaze. Several other residents lived there, too.\n\nHow and if they all are related remains unclear.\n\nHow the blaze started has yet to be determined.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s crystal clear now that the smoke has cleared is the youngest victim \u2014 Yafet Solomon, 9 \u2014 was a shining star in a tenable situation had DCRA done its job.\n\nOne of Yafet\u2019s best friends said he wanted to be a lawyer. Bless his hopeful heart.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief timeline of why Yafet\u2019s dream was cut short:\n\nIn March, a D.C. police officer, responding to a dispute inside 708 Kennedy, recorded with his body-worn camera the illegal, unsafe and horrifying conditions inside what used to be a single-family home. He reported the situation to the D.C. Fire and EMS.\n\nIn May, DCRA assigned an inspector to survey the residence for housing code violations. After visiting 708 Kennedy three times, the inspector left a business card and mailed a letter to the landlord. The case was closed after there were no responses.\n\nIn August, police officers tried to enter 708 Kennedy during a fire, but iron bars blocked them from entering and the tenants from exiting.\n\nSince then, Mayor Muriel Bowser, the D.C. Council and a parade of city officials have voiced their disgust and heartbreak about what happened at 708 Kennedy, mostly because of what should not have happened to Yafet, whose funeral was held Wednesday.\n\nThere\u2019s much to unpack in this deadly case beyond who knew about 708 Kennedy and why nothing was done until tragedy struck.\n\nSee, another burning question is why nobody noticed the scores of pharmaceutical bottles amid the backyard debris after the fire. The drugs included antipsychotics and narcotics, including diazepam and hydrocodone.\n\nAlso troubling: DCRA records indicate that 708 Kennedy was a former pharmacy, and the man who owned the property apparently owns a home in a different part of Northwest and it, too, is a former pharmacy.\n\nAnd if that weren\u2019t enough, the 708 Kennedy\u2019s deadly case visits another rusty D.C. government saw, questionable 911 emergency communications and the troublesome bureaucracy at DCRA, over which the council was to provide rigorous oversight.\n\nOh well.\n\n708 Kennedy St. reveals why tragedy strikes when the agents of a government agency see no evil, hear no evil and pinch their noses.\n\nMiss Bowser was sworn in for a second term in January. The 708 Kennedy case is her toughest yet. Good thing she invited federal prosecutors and D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine to poke their noses under the curtains.\n\nShe and the council would be smart to step aside so the lawmen and women can do their jobs.\n\nOnce their investigations are complete, there will be plenty time for political options.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
