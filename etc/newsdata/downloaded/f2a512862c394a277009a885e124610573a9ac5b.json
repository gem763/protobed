She just got rid of her old debts, but now has new debt and it\u2019s growing. We\u2019ve been together seven years and engaged for four years. After getting engaged I found out about her debt, bad FICO score FICO, -1.25%, excess parking tickets, etc. I educated and worked with her, and she eventually climbed out of it.\n\n\u2018Her parking tickets are still piling up, and her credit-card debt is $5,000 the last time I checked.\u2019\n\nNow she makes $75,000 a year and has a career with the state. Life is good, except she has new debt. She has $18,000 in student loans (a master\u2019s degree she dropped out of). We now have a 2-year-old child. Her parking tickets are still piling up, and her credit-card debt is $5,000 the last time I checked.\n\nWe have separate finances because I don\u2019t trust her to act prudently financially. Since we met I have purchased a single family home and plan to buy more real estate. (I own rental homes.) Do I have anything to worry about since we live together and I have purchased a home during our relationship and plan to buy another?\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Before I give my fianc\u00e9e a $7,000 diamond engagement ring, I want her to promise to bequeath it to my daughter\n\nThe homes are under my name, nothing is under her name although she does help by paying utility bills and groceries. I\u2019m concerned that if we were to split she would want to fight to me and feel like she is entitled to our home or new properties.\n\nSunny in California\n\nDear Sunny,\n\nI do understand your concerns about your girlfriend\u2019s lack of money management, and they are valid. Racking up parking tickets and maintaining credit-card debt don\u2019t inspire confidence.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e\u2019s fretful finances feel frustratingly fainthearted and fickle. (Try saying that sentence quickly with a gobstopper in your mouth.) But I have questions. Why did she drop out of her master\u2019s program? Something about that sentence pulled at my heart strings. She didn\u2019t just want to rack up $18,000 in student debt. It\u2019s not the same as overspending. That tells me she has dreams.\n\nWhy did she drop out of her M.A. program? She didn\u2019t just rack up $18,000 in student debt. She had dreams.\n\nWhy does she keep parking in places that result in parking tickets? Does she have a plan to pay off the $5,000 on her credit card before using her card again? Does she need help with such a plan? Maybe you can go through these issues together and, in a solemn ceremony, put the card in a box with a lock. Given that you both have a child together, act out of love, rather than fear.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e sounds impulsive, but being impulsive is not a crime. Of course, it could lead to serious financial woes in a worst-case scenario. I too wish she was more responsible. However, all of this does not add up to her being a money monster, or any kind of monster. She needs to examine the connection between her emotional life and her financial life.\n\nAlso see: My dying friend wants to marry me so I can have his Social Security \u2014 should I do it?\n\nAt our worst, we act out of anxiety or anger or frustration or, worse, shame. A financial therapist could help your girlfriend examine this pattern of behavior. What void is she trying to fill and/or what anxiety is preventing her from facing up to her financial problems? You have a 2-year-old child. Is she a good mother? Is she warm and affectionate to you? Who is she?\n\nI too want her to be responsible. But this does not add up to her being a money monster, or any kind of monster.\n\nAll of these issues are missing from your letter. My first take with what little I know: Your fear of commitment or commitment to this particular woman \u2014 given her financial shenanigans \u2014 are in some way dehumanizing or objectifying her in a way that suggests your problems in this relationship go both ways and are bigger than her debts.\n\nTo answer the legal part of your question: California is a community property state and anything you purchase before your marriage is owned by you. You take out of the marriage what you brought into it. There is some precedent of a common-law marriage in another state being recognized in California. You can read more on palimony law \u2014 and its limits in California \u2014 here and here.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t advise your fianc\u00e9e to marry someone who calls her a monster. She is your girlfriend and mother of your child.\n\nI understand that some people will read this question and react in an extreme fashion. \u201cDocument everything! Watch out! Dump her ASAP! Get out! Leave her! Run away! Get primary custody of your child! Don\u2019t get married! Get a good attorney!\u201d They are just some of the comments on your letter on the Facebook Group FB, -0.15% for this column.\n\nOf course, consult an attorney when dealing with real estate and marriage. And I wouldn\u2019t advise you to marry someone you don\u2019t trust. But I wouldn\u2019t advise your fianc\u00e9e to marry someone who calls her a monster either. She is your girlfriend and mother of your child. She has a four-figure credit-card debt and a five-figure student-loan debt. Guess what? So do millions of Americans.\n\nRelationships are a complicated business. You are more than the sum of your fears and the mother of your child is more than the sum of her parking tickets and debts.\n\nRecommended: My dying friend wants to marry me so I can have his Social Security \u2014 should I do it?\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
