KORAIL's labor union staged the strike to demand higher pay and better working conditions after failing to reach an agreement in negotiations with the management since May.\n\nDuring the strike, only 60 to 80 percent of trains operated by KORAIL were running.\n\nHowever, as the workers' demands have yet to be settled, union representatives have warned of another strike next month. They said the walkout will continue until a deal is reached.", "description": "Railway Workers End 3-Day Strike", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
