The [Twitter] poll could only fit four horses in,\u201d he laughed.\n\nIf you had the choice, who would you ride in the hk sprint this dec? \u2014 Zac Purton (@zpurton) October 14, 2019\n\nWhile trainer John Moore said Purton would ride his speed-machine Aethero next month, there has been no final decision from the three-time champion jockey.\n\n\u201cZac has got the ride unless he wants to go for something else, then I will ask Joao,\u201d Moore said.\n\nPurton partners the mercurial Pakistan Star on Sunday in what will be a crucial hit-out ahead of his final decision as the two-time Group One winner has not been seen over a 1,200m trip since his world famous last-to-first effort on debut back in 2016.\n\n\u201cPossibly he is the last one [to look at], it is going to interesting to see how he goes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s talented, whether he is going to do it on race day, we will just wait and see.\n\n\u201cIn the next month it builds up and by the time we get through November, we will know if they stack up but it is too late to chop and change by then really.\u201d\n\nPakistan Star will line up against just seven rivals with top-rated sprinters Beat The Clock, Mr Stunning, Hot King Prawn, D B Pin, Regency Legend and Little Giant all bypassing the race.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of disappointing field really, we have all of these nice sprinters in Hong Kong at the moment and they\u2019ve all decided to dodge this race, it is an anticlimax really,\u201d Purton said.\n\nIn a classic case of swings and roundabouts, Purton was struggling for a top-class sprinting ride 12 months ago, before finally settling on Little Giant who went on to eventually run fourth.\n\n\u201cI was struggling this time last year. There has been a lack of depth in our sprinting ranks so it is good to have a nice bunch of younger horses coming through to test the older guys,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why they can\u2019t stack up, they are lightly raced and progressing through the grades quite nicely, but it is up to them to take that next step.\u201d", "description": "Champion jockey Zac Purton has an embarrassment of sprinting riches....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/15/ea4c95c0-ef01-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_132148.JPG?itok=Ztyh5D_Q&v=1571116916", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
