So, I got a call one day that she was having a terrible bout of stage fright, and she was about to drop out of Chicago The Musical, and would I come over and talk to her. I was like, 'You will never meet a more supportive and loving cast. You will love this experience and you will regret it if you don't do it.'\"\n\n\"I was there for her. Then she goes through a divorce, and I get a call again,\" continued Christie, who went through four divorces of her own. \"I get a call again, because let's face it, I'm kind of an expert in that. I came again and was like, 'I'm going to help you.'\"\n\nBecause of their former bond, Brinkley said she \"thought it was a mistake\" when she first heard the news about Wendy's claims. Co-host Sharon Osbourne then chimed in, saying, \"You know what I want to do now? I want to show Wendy your x-rays.\"\n\nAs the images appeared on the screen behind her, Christie explained the severity of her injuries.\n\n\"I didn't just break the [bones]... because of the angle I hit, they shattered,\" she shared, holding up her cast and showing the bruises around her elbow to the camera. \"My surgery, that was supposed to take an hour and a half, ended up taking three hours, and they ended up putting in a plate.\"\n\nCo-host Carrie Ann Inaba (who is a judge on DWTS), then asked Christie what message she wants to send to Wendy.\n\n\"My message to Wendy is, it's so much more fun to be kind,\" she replied. \"Try it. It can't feel good to try to hurt other people. If it feels good, something's seriously wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sailor was in Los Angeles practicing her week two dance with Val. ET crashed their rehearsal, where Sailor also reacted to Wendy's allegations.\n\n\"It's so insane to me,\" Sailor said. \"I can't even find comments because it's so real to me, the emotions are still so new.\"\n\n\"Getting that call from my mom [about her injury] ... she was sobbing, crying,\" Sailor continued. \"She was so disappointed because she couldn't do it anymore. She wasn't even crying because she was hurt, she was like, 'I let everyone down. I won't be able to keep going on Dancing With the Stars.'\"\n\nHear more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSailor Brinkley-Cook Reacts to Wendy Williams' Claims That Mom Christie Faked 'DWTS' Injury (Exclusive)\n\nWendy Williams Says Christie Brinkley\u2019s 'DWTS' Injury Looks 'Fake as Hell'\n\n'DWTS': Christie Brinkley and Daughter Sailor Get Emotional Over Her Wrist Injury (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The supermodel responded to William's accusations during Thursday's episode of 'The Talk.'", "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K1lZpsEVeLNeGJ37PrCW2Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/bf726ca4c013d1c52d04a051d76a2269", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
