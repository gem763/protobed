That\u2019s nearly twice what it usually would cost.\n\nAfter all, you can\u2019t make \u201czhajiang\u201d style noodles without pork to go into its heavy bean-based sauce, Liu said.\n\nBut pork is a big part of her diet, as it is for most Chinese, and the higher prices are pinching.\n\n\u201cThis is having a huge effect on me, a huge one,\u201d she said.\n\nPork prices surged 46.7% in August from a year earlier, adding 1.08 percentage points to a 2.8% rise in the consumer price index. That\u2019s hitting Chinese families hard: pork accounts for more than 60% of their meat consumption.\n\n\u201cPeople complain pork is too expensive and buy less, so business is not going well,\u201d said Sun Tiantao, who sells pork in a market in Beijing.\n\nChina raises about half of the world\u2019s pigs, and the outbreaks of African swine fever that began over a year ago have ravaged its herds. The disease does not infect humans.\n\nTo boost pork production, the government announced this week that it will take steps to help revive hog production, prevent and control the disease and upgrade farms to further ensure pork supplies and stable prices.\n\nThat will take some doing: in August hog stocks dropped nearly 40% from a year earlier and nearly 10% from July, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.\n\nThe trend is unlikely to reverse anytime soon, and piglet prices had more than doubled from a year earlier to 52.93 yuan ($7.50) per kilogram as of last week, the ministry said.\n\nThat means the price of pork will be rising for at least another six months.\n\n\u201cIt has to go up, because increasing supply is so difficult and the farmers are leaving, and they are not coming back,\u201d said Wang Dan, an analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nThe pork crisis has at least one advantage, Wang quipped, allowing China more \u201cflexibility\u201d in its trade talks with the U.S., since smaller herds mean less need to import soybeans for feed.\n\nHuman appetites are another question.\n\n\u201cBetter to eat less pork,\u201d said a story last week in the state-owned newspaper Life Times.\n\nIt suggested a change in food habits may be in order.\n\nExperts in China are debating the idea of swapping chicken, beef or even a man-made substitute for pork.\n\nIn the meantime, Liu Min sometimes buys eggs instead.\n\n\u201cEggs are more expensive than earlier, but still cheaper than pork,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAP video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chinese families are having to rethink menu options as pork prices soar despite government efforts to rebuild herds decimated by African swine fever and large-scale closures of pig farms for environmental reasons.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fu Ting"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/china_pricey_pork_14384_c0-169-4032-2519_s1770x1032.jpg?805b7e943f911eb08095551e91bbf96f688343f8", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
