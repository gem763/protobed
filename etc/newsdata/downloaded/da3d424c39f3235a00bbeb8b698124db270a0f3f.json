But he didn't want to. Arrogance and disdain for the basic rules of parliamentary democracy have come before common sense,\" the leader of far-left Unidas Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, tweeted.\n\nMr Podemos and the Socialists tried and failed for five months to agree on a government deal.\n\nThe leaders of the right-wing People's Party (PP) and Ciudadanos said Sanchez had never really tried to form a government.\n\nSpain has been struggling to put governments together since new parties including Podemos, Ciudadanos and the far-right Vox started appearing five years ago. Before that, PP and the Socialists dominated the country's political landscape for decades.\n\nSpain was forced to repeat the December 2015 election in June 2016 after no single party succeeded in forming a government and repeated attempts to agree on a coalition failed.\n\nThere have been no major fiscal reforms since 2015, when then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's majority PP government framed the 2016 budget. After that, budgets were rolled over or approved late for just half a year.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [MADRID] Spain will hold its fourth election in four years on Nov 10 after rival parties failed to break a months-long impasse in a deeply fragmented parliament, with no guarantee the repeat vote will make it any easier for them to form a government. .
