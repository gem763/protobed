The unit gave up only seven points -- a 65-yard run by Steven Sims Jr. in the first quarter -- and allowed just 224 total yards, along with two takeaways and six sacks.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRedskins running back Adrian Peterson gave a candid response to reporters after his team's 33-7 loss when asked about what the Patriots defense did to slow down Washington's offense.\n\nAdrian Peterson, asked about the New England defense, gave his own team a delightful burn.\n\n\n\n\"They showed a lot of exotic stuff on film. But against us, they didn't really. You know? It was like, hey, we'll sit back here and see what you guys do, allow you guys to mess up.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 Adam Kilgore (@AdamKilgoreWP) October 6, 2019\n\nOuch.\n\nThe Redskins actually had decent success on the ground Sunday. They averaged 7.3 yards per rush, and even if you take away Sims' 65-yard touchdown run, Washington still would have gained 4.05 yards per carry.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeterson is right, though. The Patriots didn't need to come up with any super complicated schemes to prevent the Redskins from consistently moving the ball. Redskins quarterback Colt McCoy threw for just 119 yards with an interception, and his offensive line gave up six sacks, which put Washington in several difficult 2nd-and-long and 3rd-and-long scenarios.\n\nThe good news for the Redskins is they play the winless Miami Dolphins in Week 6.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
