We had Kate Clark in the studio along with Alex Wilhelm and a special guest, Sarah Guo from Greylock Partners, a venture firm (obviously). Guo has the distinction of having the best-ever fun fact on the show.\n\nWe kicked off with Grammarly, a company that recently put $90 million into its accounts. We chatted about for whom it was built, and if we use it today. One thing that felt clear was that consumers are more willing than before to pay for their tooling. And that means that companies like Grammarly may prove strong investment candidates.\n\nNext, we hit on two more rounds, namely Tiger Global\u2019s investment into Lattice and Clari\u2019s $60 million Series D. Starting with Lattice, a performance management company founded by none other than Sam Altman\u2019s brother, Jack. The startup raised $25 million from Tiger Global; read more about that here.\n\nClari led us to a discussion of vertical SaaS, and Guo\u2019s views on the future of SaaS products (she\u2019s bullish). Alex and Guo had a lot to say on this subject.\n\nAfter talking over a few rounds, the discussion turned to the Q3 venture market. A few things stood out from the data and projections. First, that early-stage fundraising was a little light in the quarter. It could be a single-quarter wobble, but the data was worth chewing on all the same. And, second, that seed deal and dollar volume were hot once again.\n\nAnd we wrapped with a discussion of Tempest, a new sobriety-focused startup that raised a $10 million round. Honestly, we aren\u2019t sure how we feel about the business model. Please let us know if you have thoughts.\n\nIt was a good time. A big thanks to Guo for coming on the show, and a shout-out to the team that makes Equity happen: Chris Gates and Henry Pickavet.", "description": "Hello and welcome back to\u00a0Equity, TechCrunch\u2019s venture capital-focused podcast where each week we discuss other people\u2019s money and what sense their investment choices make (or don't).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/equity-podcast-2019-phone-1-3.jpg?w=430", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
