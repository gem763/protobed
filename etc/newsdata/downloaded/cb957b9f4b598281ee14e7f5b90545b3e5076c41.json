It is possible, it seems, for human beings to live in a gauzy approximation of normalcy, with the cares of ordinary existence distracting us from the doom gathering strength on the other side of our ivy-covered walls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd who better to elucidate this absurdity than these accomplished women, who allow us to hear both their chatter and their inner monologues and to feel utterly at ease? The entirety of the design team is female, too, with set designer Paige Hathaway constructing a smart, verdant suburban patio and costume designer Alison Samantha Johnson outfitting the actresses in dandy bourgeois style.\n\nThe play runs its course in the time it takes to empty a teapot or two, just 50 minutes, and for the women to prattle on, completing each other\u2019s thoughts and filling in details about one member\u2019s troubled past. Though a measure of understated anxiety suffuses the garden party, the old acquaintances are relaxed enough to break into a silly impromptu rendition of the Petula Clark hit from the \u201960s, \u201cDowntown.\u201d\n\nIntermingled with these everyday interludes, though, are the jarring segues to Leonard, appearing in front of the closed curtain and reciting a litany of environmental calamities. We are hearing what sound like chapter headings in the story of climate change. Churchill, author of such probing pieces about science and politics gone haywire as \u201cA Number\u201d and \u201cFar Away,\u201d here presents the degradation of the world as an absurdist word salad of Biblical horrors. Intimations of floods and starvation and disease are served up as a counterpoint to the darjeeling and biscuits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe chemicals leaked through cracks in the money,\u201d the actress tells us, as she reels off the disasters. \u201cCars were traded for used meat.\u201d\n\nEndings of all sorts, and none especially happy, are what \u201cEscaped Alone\u201d catalogues. Twyford, an actress of note herself, has been taking on more directorial assignments over the past few years, and this one proves to be her most assured and successful outing yet. As one of the featured players in Studio Theatre\u2019s \u201cFar Away\u201d in the mid-2000s, she\u2019s been well acquainted for some time with Churchill\u2019s virtuosic stage vernacular. She lends that expertise beneficially to her cast, whose convergence on the stage of Signature\u2019s smaller space, the Ark, gives off the sensation of a warm and overdue reunion.\n\nCleary, Flye, Hedman and Leonard are in such gratifying synch that you forget at times how terrifyingly close to the precipice \u201cEscaped Alone\u201d means to dangle us. Then again, distraction is how we all get by, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEscaped Alone , by Caryl Churchill. Directed by Holly Twyford.
