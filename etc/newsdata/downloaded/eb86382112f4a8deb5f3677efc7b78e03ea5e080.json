Many individuals with the condition find it hard to focus, concentrate and regulate their emotions.\n\nCommenting on the findings, UniSA researcher, Associate Professor Hong Lee said, \"ADHD is a highly heritable disorder which means that a young mother may also have the genes affecting ADHD risk which is then inherited by her child.\"\n\n\"Knowing a woman has a genetic predisposition for ADHD can be recorded in her family medical history then used to monitor her health and the health of her offspring. In this way, we're able to ensure both mother and baby receive the support and help they need.\"\n\n\"Young moms can have it tough, especially as they're adjusting to becoming a parent while they're still young themselves,\" she says. \"By understanding the links between becoming a mother at a young age and having a child with ADHD, we're able to better educate and support families sooner.\"\n\n\"ADHD is treatable, but early diagnosis and interventions are key to a successful outcome.\"\n\nHowever, Assoc Prof Lee also added that while the findings are significant, \"It's important to understand that while there is a clear genetic link between ADHD and young mothers, this is not necessarily a causal relationship.\"", "description": "New Australian research has found that young mothers appear to be more likely to have a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
