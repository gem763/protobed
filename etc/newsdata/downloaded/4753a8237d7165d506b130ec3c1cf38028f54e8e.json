REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nThree other defendants who were also on trial for their involvement in a referendum held in spite of a ban and a short-lived independence declaration, were found guilty only of disobedience and not sentenced to prison.\n\nAll defendants were acquitted of the gravest charge, rebellion, but leading separatists were quick to condemn the court\u2019s decision and the jailed men sent out messages of defiance, urging people to take to the streets.\n\nFormer head of Catalonia\u2019s regional government, Carles Puigdemont, said the prison sentences were an \u201catrocity\u201d, and the head of the regional parliament Roger Torrent called them an \u201cattack on democracy\u201d.\n\nIn Barcelona, three main streets were blocked by protesters holding signs calling for \u201cFreedom for political prisoners\u201d. Outside the pro-independence Omnium Cultural headquarters in Barcelona, a crowd chanted \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again\u201d - a slogan used by separatist supporters who want to hold another referendum.\n\nDemonstrators also gathered in other parts of Catalonia. Regional train tracks were blocked outside the town of Girona, a separatist stronghold, rail operator Rodalies said on Twitter.\n\nMuch is at stake in how the court\u2019s decision will be received, both for Spain and for its wealthiest region. Catalonia\u2019s independence drive attracted worldwide attention and triggered Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades and unnerved financial markets.\n\nSeparatist protests have been largely peaceful but police sources have said authorities are prepared for any violence. Spanish authorities are keen to avoid any condemnation from abroad of the sentence as too draconian, and the separatist movement will have to decide how to react to the ruling.\n\nThe jailed separatists said via social media that they would carry on their fight.\n\n\u201cNine years in prison won\u2019t end my optimism. Catalonia will be independent if we persist. Let us demonstrate without fear, let us move forward determinedly from non-violence to freedom,\u201d said Jordi Sanchez, who was sentenced to nine years in jail. Sanchez was the leader of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) grassroots movement.\n\n\u201cUPRISING\u201d\n\nThe longest prison term - 13 years - went to the former deputy leader of the Catalan regional government, Oriol Junqueras.\n\nThe court convicted Junqueras and eight other leaders on charges of sedition and four of them of misuse of public funds, the court ruling showed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on October 1 was not just a demonstration or a massive act of citizen protest. If that had been the case, there would have been no criminal sentencing. It was a tumultuous uprising encouraged by the accused, among many others,\u201d the Madrid court said in its ruling, delivered in writing rather than in an open session.\n\nAfter the ruling was published, the CDR grassroots movement tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s time to rise up against the authoritarian fascism of the Spanish state and its accomplices. It is time for the #RevoltaPopular (popular revolt).\u201d\n\nThe government has said it is ready to take direct control of Catalonia as it did in 2017 if secessionist leaders break the law.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\n\u201cThe sentence must be carried out and complied with,\u201d acting public works minister Jose Luis Abalos told public broadcaster TVE. \u201cIn Catalonia, there is a need for clear and responsible leadership on behalf of separatists.\u201d\n\nThe ruling is likely to color a national election on Nov. 10, Spain\u2019s fourth in four years, and influence the direction taken by the separatist movement.\n\nAn opinion poll in July showed 48.3% of Catalans against secession and 44% in favor.", "description": "Spain's Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine separatist leaders from Catalonia to between nine and 13 years in prison for sedition over their role in a failed independence bid, triggering protests in Barcelona.", "authors": ["Isla Binnie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440659841&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0OY", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
