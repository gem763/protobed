Goff then fumbled while being sacked by Shaquil Barrett as the Rams (3-1) attempted a tying drive, and Suh scooped and scored against the team with which he reached the Super Bowl last season.\n\nPeyton Barber and Ronald Jones II rushed for TDs, and Cameron Brate also had a TD reception . Winston picked apart the Los Angeles secondary while going 28 of 41, and Godwin had the most catches by a Tampa Bay receiver since Keyshawn Johnson in 2001 - and it almost wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nTampa Bay went up 45-27 with 11:35 to play when Mike Evans burned Marcus Peters for a 67-yard TD capped by some goal-line showboating. But after Cooper Kupp caught a 29-yard TD pass, Peters returned an interception 32 yards for a touchdown with 8:11 to play.\n\nPeters scored despite taking a helmet-to-helmet hit at the goal line from left tackle Donovan Smith that kept him out of the rest of the game under evaluation for a concussion.\n\nTampa Bay went back ahead by eight when Winston led a 72-yard drive capped by Matt Gay\u2019s short field goal with 2:35 left.\n\nGoff got the Rams to midfield, but Barrett and Suh finished strong in Tampa Bay\u2019s first game in Los Angeles since 1993.\n\nRobert Woods had 13 catches for 164 yards, and Kupp added nine catches for 121 yards. Goff went 45 of 68 while under regular pressure in a Rams offense that didn\u2019t look much like the relentless machine built by Sean McVay in his first two seasons in LA, despite its lofty statistics and final point total. Todd Gurley rushed for two touchdowns, but got only five carries for 16 yards in the Rams\u2018 nonexistent running game.\n\nThe Buccaneers opened a five-game stretch away from Tampa with compelling play on both sides of the ball, surprising just about everybody in the Coliseum who watched their loss to the Giants last week.\n\nWinston found a groove immediately with his receivers, while the Rams\u2018 offense started off with another dose of its early-season inconsistency and curious play-calls . McVay called 13 passes and a receiver sweep before his first proper running play.\n\nJordan Whitehead picked off a tipped pass for Tampa Bay early in the second quarter, and Goff threw a terrible interception to Lavonte David moments later. Both turnovers resulted in TD catches by Godwin.\n\nFacing their biggest deficit since Week 9 of last season against New Orleans, the Rams woke up for two quick TD drives, including a tackle-breaking TD run by Gurley . But Tampa Bay made another lengthy drive before halftime capped by a TD run by Jones , a collegiate star in the Coliseum for Southern California.\n\nGoff threw his third interception on a tipped pass on fourth down in the third quarter.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBuccaneers: Evans injured his hand in the second half, but returned. \u2026 WR Breshad Perriman didn\u2019t return from a hamstring injury in the first quarter.\n\nRams: LB Bryce Hager injured his shoulder during the first half. \u2026 Rookie S Taylor Rapp left the field in the third quarter unable to put weight on his left ankle.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBuccaneers: Back on the road to face the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.\n\nRams: A quick trip to face the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night in their first NFC West game of the year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jameis Winston passed for 385 yards and threw two of his four touchdown passes to Chris Godwin, and Ndamukong Suh returned Jared Goff's fumble 37 yards for a touchdown with 1:06 to play in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 55-40 victory over the previously unbeaten Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/aptopix_buccaneers_rams_football_11580_c0-141-3377-2109_s1770x1032.jpg?b9ae98520c375e7804934dfa4b850c2423984247", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
