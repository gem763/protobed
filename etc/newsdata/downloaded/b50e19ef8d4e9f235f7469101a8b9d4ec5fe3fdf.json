Will continue forward!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe president was presumably referencing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call at last week\u2019s Democratic debate for a mandatory federal buyback of assault weapons.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d the former Texas congressman declared at the forum in Houston. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans any more.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2561/1155968404_6085821670001_6085821761001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThose comments by O\u2019Rourke \u2014 who has advocated more aggressive proposals aimed at curbing firearm violence following a mass shooting last month in his hometown of El Paso, Texas \u2014 elicited what appeared to be a death threat from a Republican state representative in Texas, and have even been criticized by some Democrats.\n\n\u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told CNN on Friday.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) similarly asserted on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cmessage doesn\u2019t help.\u201d And asked Sunday by CNN whether O\u2019Rourke said something \u201cthat\u2019s playing into the hands of Republicans,\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg, a fellow Democratic presidential contender, have sparred in recent days over the issue on the campaign trail.\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded to Trump's tweet later Wednesday morning, outlining his gun platform and encouraging the White House to take action.\n\n\"To be clear: We will buy back every single assault weapon. We\u2018ll also license every gun & do a background check on every buyer. That\u2019s what the American people want\u2014and deserve,\" he wrote online. \"The only thing stopping us from ending this epidemic is you & your cowardice. Do the right thing.\"\n\nTrump has vacillated in his support for various gun reform measures following a spate of mass shootings over the summer in California, Texas and Ohio, and POLITICO reported Monday that he will not consider a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House instituting universal background checks for firearm purchases.\n\nThe president met with aides Monday to discuss potential solutions to address gun violence, and the White House expects to release a package of proposals this week.", "description": "O'Rourke has has advocated for aggressive proposals aimed at curbing firearm violence.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ea/a5/e68103a64319bd858f8815aaf208/190918-beto-orourke-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
