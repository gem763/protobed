On arrival, he started working in a factory car dealership where he washed cars, but after several weeks the men took his paperwork and bank card. After a year he lost his job at the factory and was unable to find other work.\n\nThe two men then began forcing him to steal, telling him that because they had brought him to the country and found him work he must repay them. They evicted him from his accommodation, so he was forced to sleep rough in parks and on the streets, relying on charities and searching supermarket bins for food.\n\nIn 2018, the man was sent to prison for 10 weeks after he was caught shoplifting, and after serving his sentence he was detained under immigration powers.\n\nThe Home Office then referred him to its National Referral Mechanism (NRM) \u2013 the UK\u2019s framework for identifying victims of trafficking \u2013 which sits within the department, and it was decided in June that there were reasonable grounds to believe he was a victim of modern slavery.\n\nBut despite official guidance stating that potential victims should not usually be imprisoned, the department maintained his detention, claiming the man represented a \u201cgenuine, present and sufficiently serious threat\u201d.\n\nHe was released to a safe house following intervention from his solicitors, but the Home Office continued to try to remove him, even after the NRM concluded in May 2019 that he was a victim of labour exploitation.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Yet he was unlawfully detained and almost removed.\n\n\u201cThe judge saw through the home secretary\u2019s disingenuous attempt to go behind her own findings in order to deport a confirmed victim of trafficking. The home secretary should answer for her unlawful and reprehensible conduct in this case.\u201d\n\nThe case comes after the Home Office was accused in July of a \u201ccover-up\u201d after it was forced to disclose that its own data showed hundreds of suspected victims had been detained under immigration powers in 2018 \u2013 information ministers had previously claimed to have \u201cno record\u201d of.\n\nCharities and politicians have since condemned the \u201cconflict of interest\u201d between the department\u2019s immigration enforcement and its duty to protect trafficking victims.\n\nResponding to this case, independent MP Frank Field said: \u201cIt is deeply shocking that rather than provide this victim of modern slavery all the support they need to recover, the Home Office was single-minded in its intent to have them deported.\u201d\n\nPierre Makhlouf, assistant director of charity Bail for Immigration Detainees, said: \u201cDespite the government\u2019s claim to be a world leader in the fight against modern slavery, victims of trafficking are detained in the hundreds.\n\n\u201cThe Home Office will always see vulnerable adults and victims of trauma primarily through the lens of immigration enforcement. We ask how a Home Office that is institutionally obsessed with forcibly removing people from the country can possibly discharge its duty to protect victims of trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office has been approached for comment.", "description": "The Home Office has been forced to pay out tens of thousands of pounds in damages to a victim of modern slavery after the\u00a0courts ruled that he was unlawfully detained and threatened with deportation.", "authors": ["May Bulman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/15/home-office-sign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
