REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe benchmark index hit its all-time high on Monday, propelled by hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and expectations of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nMerck & Co Inc (MRK.N) rose 2.19% after its quarterly earnings blew past analysts\u2019 expectations, while Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) gained 3% as it raised its 2019 earnings forecast.\n\nSeven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the healthcare sector .SPXHC, which rose 0.66%.\n\nShares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), however, slipped 2.1% as the web search leader\u2019s quarterly profit missed estimates due to higher costs. Its shares drove a 0.81% fall in the communication services sector .SPLRCL.\n\nThird-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies have largely been better than expected, with over 78% of the 204 that have reported so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a retracement trade from yesterday\u2019s move in the equity markets. Earnings continue to come somewhat decent with regards to what the management is saying about future earnings,\u201d said John Brady, senior vice president at R.J. O\u2019Brien & Associates in Chicago.\n\nOther marquee names reporting this week include tech heavyweights Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) as well as oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N).\n\nThe office of the U.S. Trade Representative said late on Monday it was studying whether to extend tariff suspensions on $34 billion of Chinese goods set to expire on Dec. 28 this year.\n\n\u201cThere is a little bit of a ray of sunshine poking through some very dark clouds in the market with ... talks regarding the U.S.-China trade continuing to be more positive than negative, especially from those who are closely involved in it all,\u201d Brady said.\n\nAll eyes will now be on the Fed meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to deliver a quarter percentage point interest rate cut for the third time this year amid fears of a global economic slowdown.\n\nAt 10:14 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 0.24 points, or unchanged, at 27,090.48, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 0.84 points, or 0.03%, at 3,040.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 28.58 points, or 0.34%, at 8,297.41.\n\nBeyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) dropped 18% as the vegan burger maker said it would need to offer more store discounts amid rising competition.\n\nShares of GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N) plunged 40% after the online food delivery company warned of slowing growth as customers opted to choose from a growing pool of rival providers to get better deals.\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM.N) gained 5.1% after its quarterly net profit topped estimates but the carmaker slashed its earnings forecast for 2019 as the 40-day U.S. labor strike by the United Auto Workers union brought virtually all of its North American operations to a standstill.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 32 new lows.", "description": "The S&P 500 hovered near its record high on Tuesday, lifted by upbeat earnings from drugmakers Merck and Pfizer, while a disappointing quarterly profit from Google-parent Alphabet kept the Nasdaq firmly in the negative territory.", "authors": ["Arjun Panchadar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446176092&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0VB", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
