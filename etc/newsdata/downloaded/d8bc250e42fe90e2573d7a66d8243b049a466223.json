Many stakeholders suggested that a boxed warning and patient decision checklist could provide this information.\u201d\n\nThe FDA recommends that the boxed warning tells patients that breast implants are not lifetime devices, and that the chances of complications increase as the product ages -- something that might necessitate further surgery. The agency also called for the warning to inform patients that breast implants have been associated with the risk of developing breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).\n\nFAKE DOCTOR'S BUTT ENLARGEMENT PROCEDURE NEARLY KILLS PATIENT, DETECTIVES SAY\n\nAccording to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 313,735 breast augmentations were performed in the U.S. in 2018, up 4 percent from 2017. In July, the FDA requested Allergan pull certain models of textured breast implants and tissue expanders over concerns about their link to BIA-ALCL.\n\nThe cancer, which is a rare type of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, requires early diagnosis and intervention, including surgery and possible chemotherapy or radiation. The agency found a total of 573 unique BIA-ALCL cases including 33 patient deaths, 481 of which involved Allergan breast implants.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe FDA said the patient checklist also provides patients the opportunity to acknowledge the risk of BIA-ALCL and implant ruptures. The draft guidance is currently available for public comment.", "description": "The agency said the proposal is meant to \u201chelp ensure women receive and understand information regarding the benefits and risks of breast implants.\u201d", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/breast_implant_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
