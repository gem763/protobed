The film ends with Aurora (Elle Fanning) being crowned queen of the two kingdoms \u2013 humans and the moors \u2013 to forge a unity with her lover Prince Philip (Brenton Thwaites).\n\nFive years after the box-office hit, the proposal to Aurora by Prince Philip (now played by Harris Dickinson) sees Maleficent still fighting off bad publicity while Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), the real villain basks under pretty privilege. Their union is set to unite the two kingdoms but instead we see Queen Ingrith, Philip\u2019s evil mother\u2019s true character unravel and through the power of propaganda she is able to incite a war between the human kingdom and the moors. All the while Maleficent bonds with her ancestors by going on a self-care journey in the form of a tour of the fey realm guided by Conall (Chiwetel Ejiofor).\n\nMany critics claim the sequel is unnecessary but honestly I would attend theatre time immemorial just to see Angelina Jolie\u2019s enlarged cheekbone structure although, this time around she doesn\u2019t get as much airplay. I also enjoyed the humour amid the brawls and evil plotting. Pfeiffer was quite enthralling and a good casting choice on Disney\u2019s part. The film does have a certain disconnection between Maleficent\u2019s self-awareness and the war brewing at the Castle but, as with all Disney fairy tales, things always come together for the highest good of all, except forthe real villains, in what we call happily ever after.", "description": "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.", "authors": ["Moroetsana Serame"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/7e89b2233f8c471b9674198c1bd52209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
