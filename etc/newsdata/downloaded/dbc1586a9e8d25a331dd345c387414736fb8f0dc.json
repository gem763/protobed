(AP) - Ed Beck, a fierce rebounder for Kentucky\u2019s 1958 NCAA championship team nicknamed the \u201cFiddlin\u2019 Five,\u201d has died. He was 83.\n\nThe school said Beck died Wednesday in Sun City, Arizona. A two-year captain for coach Adolph Rupp, Beck grabbed 11.6 boards per game with 5.6 points on the school\u2019s fourth title squad. Beck was named Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Year that season.\n\nAs a junior, Beck averaged 14.1 rebounds and 9.6 points to earn Associated Press All-SEC second team honors. His career average of 10 rebounds was Kentucky\u2019s third-highest total at the time.\n\nBeck\u2019s leadership in 1958 followed a personal loss with the offseason death of his first wife, Billie, from Hodgkin\u2019s disease. He turned down an offer from the NBA\u2019s New York Knicks after graduation to enter the ministry and served there for over 50 years.\n\nBeck is survived by wife Faye and four sons. Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ed Beck, a fierce rebounder for Kentucky's 1958 NCAA championship team nicknamed the \"Fiddlin' Five,\" has died.
