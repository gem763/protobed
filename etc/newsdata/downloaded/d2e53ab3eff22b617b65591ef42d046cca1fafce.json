It gives the politically connected class enormously tempting opportunities for self-dealing, the sort of thing that is blatantly illegal in almost any other context.\n\nConsider two Washington power families: the Bidens and the McConnell-Chaos.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Schweizer", "Nytimes.Com Opinion What-Hunter-Biden-Did-Was-Legal-And-Thats-The-Problem.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
