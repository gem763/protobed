Stunning horses show off their luscious locks", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nThese amazing photographs show a herd of Icelandic horses showing off their luscious locks.\n\nAnna Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir, 65, captured the shots while on a horse riding trip- and noticed their perfectly kept manes.\n\nThe photos show the horse's locks blowing in the wind as the animals gallop through stunning Icelandic scenery.\n\nThis trio of 'rock star' Icelandic horses were snapped by 65-year-old photographer, Anna Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir while on a horse-riding trip near Jokulsarlon\n\nThe Icelandic horse is one of the oldest horse breeds in the world and were brought to the country by the Vikings in the eighth century\n\nIn order to keep the bloodline of the Icelandic horse pure, laws in the country prohibit animals that leave from returning. It also prevents people from importing other horses, stopping diseases from spreading too\n\nThe hide of an Icelandic horse is double-layered to keep them extra warm in a country which only sees highs of 55F in mid Summer\n\nEach horse can reach a height of around five feet tall and can weigh up to 900 pounds\n\nPound for pound, the Icelandic horse is the strongest horsebreed in the world\n\nIcelandics are usually raised in herds which allows them to develop their social skills\n\nThey usually live up until around 30 and some have been known to exceed 40\n\nReports say that the breed are generally very docile, easy to handle and comfortable around humans\n\nThey come in 42 different colours with hundreds of variations and hundreds of hairstyles\n\nThe herd can be seen galloping through the flat plains of Iceland\n\nThe horse's mane grows to protect the neck and it's generally thicker and coarser than the rest of its coat\n\nThe reason for the mane it is to keep the neck warm and to allow water to run off when they are unable to find shelter from the rain\n\nHorses inherit their mane from their parents. Some manes have been known to reach a horse's knees but these are bred characteristics and not natural. Normally, the hair will grow a little over the horses' neck\n\nDespite it being smaller in size than other horses, the Icelandic is not a pony. The breed is still used for shepherding, as well as leisure and racing\n\nThe Icelandic horse is mentioned throughout the Norse sagas and the breed was venerated in mythology\n\nThe unwelcoming environment of Iceland, plagued by cold and volcanic eruptions, has helped to make the breed what it is today through natural selection. In the 18th Century, the volcanic eruption at Laki wiped out most of them\n\nIn Norse times the Icelandic horse was considered a family or individual's most prized possession and some were ridden as war horses into battle\n\nA pair of beautiful Icelandic horses show off their luscious locks in another stunning photo taken by Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir\n\nThe breed was exported to the UK during the industrial revolution to work as pit ponies, carrying out coal from mines", "description": "These amazing photographs, captured by Anna Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir, show a herd of Icelandic horses sporting a range of different hairstyles that make them look like 'rock band members.'", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19791728-0-image-a-128_1571235976362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
