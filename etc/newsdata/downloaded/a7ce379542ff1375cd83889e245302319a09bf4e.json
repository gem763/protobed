Australia are a really good bowling attack and asked questions all day. It\u2019s frustrating for us not being able to capitalise on our start.\u201d\n\nMedium-pacer Mitchell Marsh took four wickets to boost Australia\u2019s bid to secure a 3-1 series win after their captain Tim Paine won the toss and surprisingly sent England in to bat.\n\nPat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood bowled tidy opening spells but the touring side\u2019s vaunted pace attack lacked the consistent threat which has caused problems for England\u2019s fragile top order throughout the series.\n\nJoe Denly, on 14, played a loose stroke at a wide delivery from Cummins and edged to second slip where Steve Smith fumbled the chance before grabbing the ball before it hit the ground.\n\nThe opening partnership of 27 was the highest of the series but it was another failure for the 33-year-old Denly, who made battling fifties in the last two tests without staking a claim to a long-term place in the team.\n\nCHARMED LIFE\n\nRoot, badly dropped on 24 by Peter Siddle at fine leg after playing a casual pull stroke, was also put down by wicketkeeper Paine off Cummins and England reached lunch at 86-1.\n\nRoot was given another life when Smith spilled a sharp chance in the slips but Rory Burns hit seven fours in another determined knock.\n\nThe young opening batsman was three runs away from his half century when he got cramped up by a short ball from Hazlewood and spooned a simple catch to Marsh at mid-wicket.\n\nBen Stokes, loudly cheered to the wicket after his match-winning century in the third test, cautiously moved to 20 before he was tempted into a wild heave at medium-pacer Marsh and the ball looped off a leading edge to point.\n\nRoot got to a patient fifty, off 105 balls, and his side moved on to 169-3 at tea, but any hopes England had of a substantial score disappeared in the final session.\n\nRoot was bowled by a fine Cummins delivery which hit his off stump and Jonny Bairstow was trapped lbw for 22 by a Marsh yorker.\n\nSam Curran hooked Cummins for an audacious six but two deliveries later the young all-rounder was adjudged lbw, only to be recalled to the crease because Cummins had bowled a no ball.\n\nHis reprieve was short-lived, however, as Curran edged Marsh to Smith at second slip for 15 and the same bowler snared Chris Woakes lbw to claim his fourth wicket on his recall to the side.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cI was like a kid at Christmas this morning,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIt can be a long tour when you are not playing. I just wanted to try and get an opportunity at some stage and it was nice to produce today. The ball came out reasonably well.\u201d\n\nJofra Archer then nicked Hazlewood to Paine before Buttler briefly lifted the crowd by hitting Hazlewood for two sixes in a row.\n\nButtler pulled Hazlewood over the ropes again to reach his fifty and with Jack Leach providing obdurate support, the ninth-wicket pair shared an unbroken stand of 45 to boost England\u2019s chances of levelling the series.", "description": "England's batting frailties were exposed again as they wasted a solid start and laboured to 271 for eight on the first day of the final Ashes test against Australia at The Oval on Thursday.", "authors": ["Ed Osmond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429166137&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1UB", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
