His perspective on the fight game has changed, and at times it\u2019s seemed as though his motivations weren\u2019t in the right place, especially when he was struggling to balance his religious beliefs with the idea of stepping in a cage to inflict physical harm on another man.\n\nIf there\u2019s any part of MacDonald that doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore, defeating Douglas Lima (31-7 MMA, 13-3 BMMA) in their $1 million tournament final rematch would be a prime way to go out. MacDonald\u2019s longtime coach Zahabi, doesn\u2019t see it happening, though.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say he won a million and retired, I feel like personally he\u2019s going to come back even if he doesn\u2019t need the money,\u201d Zahabi, who runs Tristar Gym in Montreal, told MMA Junkie. \u201cThat\u2019s just where I feel he\u2019s at. He\u2019s going to miss fighting if he ever hangs it up. In my opinion he has a lot more fight left in him. Before the Neiman (Gracie) fight people were like, \u2018Did he just retire?\u2019 That\u2019s not what he said.\n\n\u201cFighters are emotional after a fight. Some of them do retire for real. It does happen, but it also swings the other way. You start feeling like you want to go back in. Georges (St-Pierre) at one point retired, he wasn\u2019t sure and he came back to win the world title. I never count them out, personally I never count that out.\u201d\n\nZahabi admits there\u2019s been some challenges working with MacDonald this year. None of them related to his work ethic in the gym, however, but instead finding a balance between his personal life and Bellator needing to maintain its tournament schedule.\n\nThere was initially a lot of pressure on MacDonald to make a quick turnaround from his semifinal win over Gracie in June and rematch Lima in September. The promotion worked with MacDonald to book the timeline that suited him better, and they came up with Bellator 232, which takes place Saturday at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., and streams on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\n\u201cI like where he\u2019s at but to be honest he just had a baby so it was a tight timeline,\u201d Zahabi said. \u201cI really appreciated Bellator gave him more time. They wanted him in September and I feel like they did what they could. I\u2019m really happy with Scott Coker. I don\u2019t know him personally, but just from seeing how he treats the fighters I have a lot of respect for him. He understands. We understand there\u2019s a business side, but there\u2019s also a human side. He had a baby very, very recently Rory. When you have a newborn it\u2019s tough to have a training camp. He\u2019s sacrificing, he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s got to do and they gave him an extra month.\n\n\u201cI thought that was huge from Bellator. We respect Bellator. We know it\u2019s business. We know the fans want to see the fight and it has to happen soon. It was tough for Rory to have to fight back-to-back then have a baby. I\u2019m really happy they gave him some breathing room. It showed a lot of heart from Bellator. They show the value of a fighter.\u201d\n\nThe extra time also gave MacDonald time to prepare for Lima accordingly. Their first fight at Bellator 192 in January 2018 was an all-out battle for 25 minutes, with MacDonald taking the deciding fifth rounds with some smart tactics.\n\nAll signs have pointed to a rematch since the original meeting. MacDonald and Lima both worked their way through opposing sides of the grand prix bracket to find themselves as the last men standing in the eight-man tournament.\n\nZahabi said he\u2019s compelled by the dynamics of the rematch. MacDonald has said he\u2019s hoping to make the fight easier for himself this time around, and Zahabi said a strategy has been formed based off the first fight that should make the second encounter look different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting fight because they already fought before and it was so close,\u201d Zahabi said. \u201cBefore you fight a guy like Lima, you know what he does, but you don\u2019t know the chemistry, how his chemistry is going to be with Rory. Now we saw what their chemistry is like. Styles is a major component of MMA, more than any other combat sport. Boxing, yes, styles matter, but it\u2019s still boxing. There\u2019s not as many possibilities for change, whereas MMA there\u2019s so many things that could be different.\n\n\u201cThere are more possibilities, so now that we know what their chemistry is like we\u2019re going to explore the different possibilities. Because they know each other so well they\u2019re going to go in there with a different strategy, at least we are. It\u2019s going to be a competitive fight, but always a different fight.\u201d", "description": "Firas Zahabi doesn't expect Rory MacDonald to go anywhere once the Bellator welterweight grand prix concludes at Bellator 232.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/rory-macdonald-bellator-220.png?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
