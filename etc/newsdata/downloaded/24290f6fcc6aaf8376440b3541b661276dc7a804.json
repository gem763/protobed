It is understood Downing Street last night offered Labour MPs a sweetener on workers\u2019 rights in a bid to persuade them to come on board.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and his ministers spent yesterday telephoning MPs on all sides in a last-minute bid to woo them\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock was among ministers reaching out to opposition MPs\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill will include a legally binding commitment for MPs to get a vote on whether to follow suit every time the EU introduces new employment measures.\n\nA No 10 spokesman said: \u2018The UK has a long and proud tradition of leading the way in workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections, where we have always set a high standard. We recognise that MPs want to see these hard-won rights protected, not weakened by our departure from the EU, and we are happy to ensure this is the case.\u2019\n\nDowning Street has also pledged that there will be a \u2018parliamentary lock\u2019 where MPs get a vote on the Government\u2019s objectives when it comes to negotiating a future partnership with the EU.\n\nFormer defence secretary Penny Mordaunt has also been assisting efforts to persuade MPs.\n\nGareth Snell MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central (left). Laura Smith MP for Crewe and Nantwich (right)\n\nCaroline Flint MP for Don Valley (left). Justin Madders MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston (right)\n\nSeven Labour MPs \u2013 Jim Fitzpatrick, Sir Kevin Barron, Sarah Champion, Melanie Onn, John Mann, Graham Stringer and Ronnie Campbell \u2013 have publicly declared their intention to back the deal. And Rosie Cooper and Caroline Flint are expected to do the same after previously supporting Theresa May\u2019s deal.\n\nA further 13 are considering such a move. However, Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who sits on Labour\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC), yesterday threatened Labour backbenchers with deselection if they vote for a deal. In an effort to turn the thumbscrews on potential rebels, he tweeted: \u2018Labour MPs cannot and must not vote for [Mr Johnson\u2019s deal].\n\n\u2018If they do, the NEC will have no choice but to replace them with a new, socialist Labour candidate at the next election.\u2019\n\nRosie Cooper MP for West Lancashire (left). Gloria De Piero MP for Ashfield (right)\n\nHuda Elmi, another NEC member, added: \u2018Any Labour MP that sides with Boris Johnson has no right to stand at the next election.\u2019\n\nIn a letter to all Labour MPs last night, Mr Corbyn urged his backbenchers to reject \u2018this sell-out deal [that] won\u2019t bring this country together\u2019.\n\nBut a Labour spokesman insisted rebels were not being threatened with the removal of the whip or deselection. Downing Street was last night optimistic it would more than double the five Labour MPs that supported Mrs May\u2019s Brexit deal in March.\n\nGrahame Morris MP for Easington (left). Stephen Kinnock MP for Aberavon (right)\n\nMiss Onn, who represents Great Grimsby, yesterday urged her colleagues not to risk \u2018this final shot at a deal [slipping] through our fingers\u2019 as she became the latest Labour MP to publicly declare their support.\n\nIn a joint article with Tory Victoria Prentis, published in the Guardian, she pleaded with them to \u2018use this unique chance to help us move this on, and get back to helping our constituents\u2019. \u2018Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that,\u2019 the pair added.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour veteran Ronnie Campbell revealed the behind-the-scenes pressure being exerted on MPs by Mr Corbyn and other senior members of the party, as they attempted to convince rebels to abstain rather than vote for the PM\u2019s deal.\n\nRuth Smeeth MP for Stoke-on-Trent North (left). Stephanie Peacock MP for Barnsley East (right)\n\nHe said, as well as the leader, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and party chairman Ian Lavery had been in contact since his declaration of support for the withdrawal agreement on Thursday. But the Blyth MP said their attempts had been unsuccessful. \u2018I think you\u2019ve got to grasp the straw yourself and get this sorted one way or another,\u2019 he told the BBC.\n\n\u2018I appreciate people being 100 per cent Remain but I\u2019m 100 per cent Leave and always have been,\u2019 he added.\n\nOn Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell, he said: \u2018I\u2019ve been comrades with them for 30 years. [When I] voted against Maastricht, the Lisbon Treaty, the Dublin Treaty and all the other treaties... who was with me in the lobbies at that particular time? Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.\u2019\n\nDan Jarvis MP for Barnsley Central (left). John Cruddas MP for Dagenham and Rainham (right)\n\nbrexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.\n\nMr Campbell said his concerns over the future of workers\u2019 rights under the Brexit terms had been satisfied by a government promise to MPs that Parliament will vote on any proposed changes.\n\n\u2018I understand that there is going to be something put forward that anything [on] workers rights has to come back to Parliament,\u2019 he added. \u2018We will wait and see whether that materialises and if the Tories agree to it. If they do, I\u2019ll be happy on that.\u2019\n\nThe North East politician said as many as 12 people from the Labour benches could cross the floor. \u2018To hazard a guess, I think there could be at least 12 Labour MPs who would vote for the deal,\u2019 the MP said, adding: \u2018[The PM] would want at least 20 to get it through but where we get the other ones from I do not know.\u2019", "description": "Boris Johnson and his ministers spent yesterday calling MPs on all sides in a last-minute bid to woo them.
