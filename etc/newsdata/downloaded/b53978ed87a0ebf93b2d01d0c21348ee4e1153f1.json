Or you can look at CCS as a means of capturing carbon from the atmosphere to help draw down the excessive CO2 that has already been emitted,\" she said.\n\n\"Government policy on reducing carbon pollution should not be about throwing a lifeline to coal, oil and gas, it should focus on transitioning to clean zero-pollution options.\n\n''There is a finite budget on the table for Australian Carbon Credit Units. Paying Santos or other companies with fossil fuel interests to try to sequester their pollution is not a good use of that public money.\n\n''CCS is still unproven as a long-term means of storing carbon. Whether there should be separate funding for research into future technologies and means of storing carbon pollution already emitted, or to assist industries that overshoot safe limits, is another question.\n\n\"That funding should not be provided through ACCUs or initiatives to reduce Australia\u2019s climate pollution.''", "description": "Big energy and industrial companies say tradeable carbon credits should be issued to companies storing carbon dioxide underground.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5734%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_40%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bd24a85b7a04d1feaabeb396dccbd2d66b052b1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
