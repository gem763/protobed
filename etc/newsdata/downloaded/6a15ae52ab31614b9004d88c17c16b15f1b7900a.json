Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.\n\nThe U.S. economy is in a good place though it faces some risks, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday in a brief speech that didn\u2019t go into detail on the outlook for growth or interest rates.\n\n\u201cUnemployment is near a half-century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2% objective,\u201d he said in the text of opening remarks to a \u201cFed Listens\u201d event in Washington. \u201cOur job is to keep it there as long as possible.\u201d\n\nPowell spoke after release of a mixed jobs report that showed payrolls growth slowing last month even as the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since 1969.\n\nComing on the heels of downbeat surveys of company purchasing managers, the jobs numbers damped fears of an imminent recession and provided a lift to the stock market.\n\nWhile Powell didn\u2019t specifically mention Friday\u2019s employment report in his speech, he did speak of \u201cthe importance of sustaining our historically strong job market,\u201d noting that many more Americans are benefiting as a result.\n\n\u201cWhile not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall it is -- as I like to say -- in a good place,\u201d the Fed chairman said.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year to shelter the U.S. economy from weak global growth and trade-policy uncertainty. Traders in federal funds futures are betting that the central bank will reduce rates again at its Oct. 29-30 meeting.\n\nPowell gave no clear steer on the future path of rates in his remarks, which were mostly devoted to the Fed\u2019s longer-term strategic review of its policies and practices.\n\nAs part of that examination, the central bank is holding a series of \u201cFed Listens\u201d events to gather opinions from academics, community organizers, companies and others about what it should do.\n\n\u201cIn this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2% inflation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cDoing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies.\u201d\n\nWhile asking questions to panelists at the event, the Fed chair said he would like to see inflation move higher to consistently meet the central bank\u2019s 2% target.\n\n\u201cWe actually want inflation to be a little bit higher,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be clear, we are looking for it to be just a little bit higher,\u201d and not \"sliding down\u201d like in some other places in the world, Powell said.\n\n(Adds comments from Powell in second-to-last paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Steve Matthews.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rich Miller in Washington at rmiller28@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Scott Lanman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
