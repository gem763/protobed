Witness the crush of anti-business and charter-school legislation that Democrats in Sacramento passed last week.\n\nUnions are breaking open their finest burgundies after Democrats whooped through legislation to reclassify hundreds of thousands of independent contractors as employees. The main targets are companies in the so-called gig economy like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash that use digital platforms to connect workers with customers.\n\nIndependent contractors can set their own hours and work for multiple businesses. But they can\u2019t unionize under the National Labor Relations Act and aren\u2019t entitled to paid sick leave, workers compensation, overtime and unemployment insurance.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys have been suing gig companies for misclassifying workers, but they\u2019ve been stymied by arbitration agreements. Then last year the California Supreme Court substantially broadened the definition of an employee in a case involving a delivery company, and the Legislature is now going further.\n\nThe legislation defines an independent contractor as a person who \u201cperforms work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business\u201d and is \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.\u201d The language is strict enough that Democrats exempted dozens of professions such as architects and accountants.\n\nBut then they added exceptions to the exceptions after unions complained. The AFL-CIO has prepared an exemption request form for businesses that asks \u201cHave you met with affected unions?\u201d Plaintiff attorneys, unions and courts will essentially decide whether businesses are covered by the new law.\n\nLyft and Uber offered a compromise that included a $21-an-hour minimum wage for time spent driving and picking up customers, a fund to pay for benefits and the ability for workers to negotiate pay with multiple employers. But Democrats rejected it after unions did. The legislation\u2019s author is a member of the Teamsters union, which wants to organize the ride-hailing industry and truck drivers that Amazon relies on for faster deliveries.\n\nLyft recently said that \u201cthe vast majority of job opportunities would go away under an employment model\u201d and \u201ccosts would also be higher on the passenger side.\u201d The bill is also retroactive so plaintiff attorneys will be able to file class actions against businesses for unpaid overtime and rest breaks.\n\nUber for its part says its drivers are still correctly classified as independent contractors under the new law and plans to defend their employment status in court. If that fails, Uber will sponsor a ballot initiative in November 2020. Good luck with that.\n\nMeanwhile, Sacramento Democrats bestowed other gifts on their trial-attorney donors. This includes tripling the statute of limitations to three years for bringing employment discrimination claims, expanding the ability of employees to recover penalties for state labor-code violations, and limiting arbitration agreements in employment.\n\nFormer Gov. Jerry Brown stopped many of his party\u2019s most destructive instincts, but current Gov. Gavin Newsom has national ambitions\u2014don\u2019t laugh\u2014and won\u2019t restrain his supermajority. This includes letting teachers unions limit charter-school expansion. Democrats passed a bill last week to let local districts veto new charters not \u201cconsistent with the interests of the community.\u201d\n\nThe California Charter Schools Association chose not to oppose the bill after being threatened with an outright moratorium. They\u2019re hoping that a ballot initiative backed by teachers unions to eliminate the state\u2019s constitutional property tax cap on commercial property will ease the fiscal pressures on local school districts and political opposition to charters. Don\u2019t bet on it.\n\nBusiness elites in California have backed Democrats for cultural reasons. They thought they could mollify progressives, and companies have hired many former Obama hands. But the Golden State is run these days by unions and trial lawyers, and Sacramento is a prelude for taking the political model nationwide.", "description": "California\u2019s agenda: fewer charters, fewer gig workers, more lawsuits.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108964/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
