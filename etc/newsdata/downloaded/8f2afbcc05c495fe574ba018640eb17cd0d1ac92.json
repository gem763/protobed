It\u2019s launching sometime this year, first in the US, Canada, UK, and most of Europe.\n\nThe service will let you play all manner of computer games streamed from Google\u2018s data centers to your devices running the Chrome browser or ChromeOS platform, or even your TV with a Chromecast Ultra plugged in. You won\u2019t need any additional hardware to run Stadia, and you won\u2019t need to install anything to play games. As Google VP Phil Harrison noted in an interview with Eurogamer, \u201cAnywhere where YouTube runs well, Stadia can run.\u201d\n\nGoogle says it already streams graphics-intensive titles at 1080p resolution and 60 fps; that\u2019ll ramp up to 4K resolution and 60 fps, along with support for HDR and surround sound at launch later in 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that Google didn\u2019t run an extensive demonstration of Stadia in action on stage during the hour-long presentation at GDC; when id Software\u2019s executive producer Marty Stratton showed up to talk about his studio\u2019s upcoming FPS, DOOM Eternal, he invited audience members to check out the game in action on the platform a couple of hours later at the event.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nGoogle is packing its Cloud and data centers around the world with specialized Linux-based computers equipped with a 2.7GHz processor paired with 16GB RAM, and a custom GPU built in partnership with AMD to deliver 10.7 teraflops of processing power to run the games you choose to play. For reference, that\u2019s more than a PS4 Pro and an Xbox One X\u2019s output combined.\n\nGoogle says its Stadia server hardware is more powerful than a PS4 Pro and an Xbox One X combined\n\nThe company says it\u2019ll make games available across the web: you\u2019ll be able to hit \u2018Play\u2019 while watching a game stream on YouTube to start a new round, or open a link that takes you to a specific point in a game that your friend was playing, or launch a title from the Stadia store. Google also demonstrated leaving a game on one device and picking up where they left off \u2013 seamlessly \u2013 on another device.\n\nOptional hardware: Stadia controller\n\nThe Stadia controller looks unremarkable, but it has a neat feature: it connects via Wi-Fi directly to Google\u2019s data center to reduce input lag\n\nGoogle also unveiled the only piece of consumer hardware designed for its new service, the Stadia gamepad. It looks like most other controllers, but includes buttons for two novel features. The Capture button initiates a stream of your gameplay straight to YouTube (Google says it\u2019ll manage a 4K stream at 60fps), and the Assistant button lets you invoke a bunch of features using your voice and the inbuilt mic on the gamepad \u2013 like asking for a walkthrough of the level you\u2019re stuck on.\n\nThey only slipped in a quick look at the back, but Google's #Stadia controller has the Konami code on it. Neeeerrrrrrrrdddsssss! pic.twitter.com/Q8rKzicQZY \u2014 Ellen Rose (@icklenellierose) March 19, 2019\n\nYou don\u2019t have to use the Stadia gamepad to run the service; Google notes you can use pretty much any controller that\u2019s compatible with your device. However, in addition to the aforementioned features, it can also enhance your experience by reducing lag, thanks to its ability to connect directly to the cloud over Wi-Fi.\n\nThe vision for Stadia\n\nThe idea behind Stadia, Google explained, is for it to essentially be an all-encompassing platform to support the next generation of gaming, and so that covers not only the streaming service and cloud infrastructure, but also support for developers and publishers, a range of features to enable players to share their experiences with others and invite them to join in on the action, and tools for content creators on its YouTube gaming video platform to draw in their audience.\n\nGoogle demonstrated how you could pick up a game from where you left off across devices, seamlessly\n\nGoogle noted that it\u2019s been working on this technology internally for years, and is taking advantage of its network of more than 7,500 edge node locations worldwide to deliver this service from the cloud. The goal is to make premium games available on a wide range of devices, and to allow people to enjoy them with whatever hardware they have handy.\n\nThe announcement of Stadia also saw Google reveal its new Stadia Games and Entertainment, a studio that will develop content for the platform in-house. It\u2019ll be led by Jade Raymond, a celebrated veteran in the game industry who\u2019s previously worked at EA and Ubisoft. She took to the stage today to explain that Google will work with other studios of all sizes to make its technology available to them easily.\n\nIntegrated with YouTube\n\nRather than treat Stadia as an entirely standalone service, Google sees people using it from and with YouTube. That means your starting point with Stadia could be a game trailer on the video platform, or a live stream of a tournament; you could simply hit Play on either video stream and start playing \u2013 solo or with others \u2013 within a few seconds.\n\nA feature called State Share lets you invite others \u2013 your friends, your YouTube audience, or your social media followers \u2013 to play a title from a specific point, with your position and location in the game environment intact, as well as your inventory, just by sending out a link.\n\nGoogle also explained that you\u2019ll be able to use Assistant to look up hints on YouTube, and the service will pinpoint the exact part of a video to help you out of the bind you\u2019re in, in any game.\n\nIs this the future of gaming?\n\nThere are several unknowns about Google\u2019s new venture at the moment. As I noted above, we haven\u2019t yet got a proper look at just how well Stadia works; we also don\u2019t know exactly when in the year it\u2019ll launch, and what it\u2019ll cost. Plus, it\u2019s only opening up to certain countries in the west to start, and it isn\u2019t clear how long the company will take to expand more widely across the world.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s safe to say that a major factor in determining whether Stadia will be a success and revolutionize gaming is performance \u2013 both in terms of visual fidelity, and lag and latency management. If Google can crack that \u2013 something that seemed incredibly difficult with previous similar services like OnLive nearly a decade ago \u2013 it could have a compelling product on its hands.\n\nWith its YouTube integration, support for several platforms, and the flexibility to share gaming experiences across the web, it seems like Google shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting Stadia in front of potential users. But it\u2019ll also need to figure out an ideal business model to attract and retain game developers and publishers, so it can offer players a varied, high-quality library of titles.\n\nFrom what we saw on stage today, it sounded Google had a lot of good ideas about the next era of gaming. Now for the hard part: making this amazing dream come true.\n\nIf you missed the livestream, head here to watch it.\n\nTNW Conference 2019 is coming!
