But Hardus says the man never said a word to him about how or why he\u2019d ended up in the ocean.\n\nThe freezing water made it all the more challenging to keep the man\u2019s head above water, even though he\u2019s a surfer and used to the cold, Hardus says.\n\n\u201cThe man was wearing heavy clothing, which caused him to immediately start sinking. I had to keep his head above water.\n\n\u201cConditions weren\u2019t unusually stormy but your body can go into shock \u2013 the jump [from the wharf] is quite high.\u201d\n\nHe had to keep the man afloat for longer than 20 minutes until rescuers arrived.\n\nBoth the man and Hardus were pulled from the water by a fireman\u2019s rope. \u201cHe never said a word \u2013 I think he was in shock,\u201d Hardus says. \u201cOnce we were out of the water, we were both taken to hospital.\n\n\u201cI really hope he\u2019s doing well.\u201d\n\nHardus was somewhat disappointed that he also suffered from hypothermia. \u201cI\u2019m used to the cold water . . . I couldn\u2019t believe I got sick too.\u201d\n\nNo, he says shyly, he\u2019s no hero. \u201cI\u2019m just one more person who was able to do something helpful for someone else.\u201d\n\nQuinton Liebenberg, who owns the restaurant where the incident took place, says he and his staff have seen a number of attempted suicides at the wharf over the past few years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to recover several people from the water in various incidents,\u201d he says.", "description": "\u201cSo I took my jacket off and dove off the wharf.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8921/9f20233fdb114c558820179083953410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-28"}
