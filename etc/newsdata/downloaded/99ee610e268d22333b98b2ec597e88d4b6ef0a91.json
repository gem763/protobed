Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort opened for a full day on Wednesday after having closed early Tuesday. SeaWorld Orlando was reopening mid-morning Wednesday after being closed all day Tuesday.\n\nAirports in Florida may be breathing a slight sigh of relief, but the anxiety is just moving north to new cities that could be in the storm's path.\n\nAmerican Airlines has issued a travel alert for 20 U.S. airports, including eight coastal airports in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\n\"Additionally, due to the size, strength and location of the hurricane, we will continue to experience a disruption to our operation throughout the week, specifically on flights that operate along the East Coast,\" the airline said.\n\nSo far the impact on Canadian flights has been fairly limited, though WestJet, Air Canada and other charter airlines have cancelled a handful of flights to the area and rebooked passengers as a precaution.\n\nOttawa issued a travel advisory for the entire region on Wednesday, urging Canadians to avoid all non-essential travel to a large area of the U.S., from Florida up to Virginia.", "description": "The impact on travelers from Hurricane Dorian lessened somewhat on Wednesday, even as the devastation from its wind and rain has yet to hit the mainland.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270543.1567626402!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/american-airlines-basic-economy.jpg"}
