Abdullah said turnout numbers had been received so far from 3,736 of 4,756 polling centres nationwide. Almost 800 centres had still to report their figures and the status of more than 200 other centres was also unclear.\n\nPreliminary results are not expected before Oct. 19 and final results not until Nov. 7. If no candidate gets over half of the votes, a second round will be held between the two leading candidates.\n\n\u201cTurnout appears to have been dampened not just by Taliban threats, but also voter disinterest,\u201d wrote Thomas Ruttig and Jelena Bjelica of the Afghanistan Analysts Network.\n\nIn the last presidential election in 2014, roughly 7 million turned out to vote, though widespread fraud tainted the election and results were never declared.\n\nAhead of Saturday\u2019s poll, Taliban fighters attacked several polling stations across the country to try to derail the process, but intense security prevented large-scale violence.\n\nThere were more than 400 attacks, mostly small-scale, carried out by the militants, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network.\n\nMany Afghans still braved the threat of militant attacks to vote in an election seen as a major test of the Western-backed government\u2019s ability to protect democracy against Taliban attempts to derail it.\n\nOver a dozen candidates are vying for the presidency, led by incumbent Ashraf Ghani and his former deputy Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nThe Afghanistan Analysts Network said there were also technical shortcomings in the vote including biometric devices not working, missing voter names and election material sent to the wrong province.\n\nAs many as eight election staff were kidnapped on Saturday evening by the Taliban in central Parwan province\u2019s Shinwari district, the provincial governor\u2019s spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cThe local government and tribal elders are working to release them,\u201d she said on Sunday.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nTwo policeman and one civilian were killed in mostly small-scale Taliban attacks, and 37 people were injured, the interior ministry said.\n\nPrevious elections were marred by dozens of deaths, accusations of fraud and allegations that the election commission was not independent. Memories of those issues hung over Saturday\u2019s vote.\n\nThe days after voting are also fraught. The Taliban often attack those transporting ballot boxes from local voting centres to larger regional offices for counting. From there, the boxes make their way to the capital Kabul.", "description": "At least 2.2 million people voted in Afghanistan's presidential election with more votes to come, the election commission head Maulana Abdullah said on Sunday, indicating a very low turnout that could mar the result.", "authors": ["Hamid Shalizi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435169359&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S04L", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
