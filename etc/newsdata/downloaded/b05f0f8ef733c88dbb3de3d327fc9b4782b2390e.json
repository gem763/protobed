This is what democracy looks like' Sadiq Khan\n\nMany waved EU flags and placards stating: \u201cTogether for the final say,\u201d the title of yesterday\u2019s protest. Others held effigies of Boris Johnson, while one group pulled a float carrying a figure of senior Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings \u2013 with \u201cDemonic Cummings\u201d daubed across its forehead \u2013 using the prime minister as a puppet.\n\nShortly before 3pm, when news that MPs had voted to back the Oliver Letwin amendment broke, the thousands crammed in Parliament Square erupted wildly and began shouting \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d.\n\nLater, Labour MP David Lammy revealed that he could hear the crowd from inside the Commons. Tweeting, he wrote: \u201cWe can hear your roar.\u201d\n\nAs the celebrating crowd continued to spill into the streets outside Westminster, Sadiq Khan told them that EU citizens were a vital element of what made London a great city.\n\n\u201cThey are our friends, members of our family, they are our colleagues. Over the last three years they have been feeling anxious, worried and heartbroken.\n\n\u201cI want you to look around. This is what democracy looks like,\u201d said the capital\u2019s mayor.\n\nHowever, the upbeat atmosphere soured after the MPs\u2019 vote when prominent Brexiters Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg, walking with his son, were aggressively heckled by protesters despite a heavy police presence.\n\nThe size of yesterday\u2019s march would mean that only the 2003 protest against the Iraq war, which some estimates have put at as high as 1.5 million people, was definitively larger.\n\nOrganisers said the exact number was impossible to calculate but had used \u201cflow and fill rates and crowd density monitoring\u201d to calculate its approximate size. The Metropolitan Police said they would not be offering crowd-size figures, but at one point issued a statement saying that the crowd was so dense that marchers might not even be able to reach Whitehall, let alone parliament.\n\nFrom the outset the numbers seemed to match predictions of a vast turnout, with many marchers saying that they were kept stationary at Hyde Park Corner, close to the march\u2019s starting point, and \u201csevere bottlenecks\u201d reported by the People\u2019s Vote along Piccadilly.\n\nThe march organisers are also asking people to sign a letter to Boris Johnson, EU leaders, MPs and MEPs, asking them to allow \u201cthe chance to check whether we want to proceed with Brexit\u201d.\n\nLast night more than 23,000 people had signed it.", "description": "Led by mayor Sadiq Khan, around one million protesters gathered to demand a fresh referendum", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0beaa44cfe25f54b45c48a31f89f81506dd22c48/76_81_6423_3854/master/6423.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=081d165c6168ede98bf0b58259fd86f2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
