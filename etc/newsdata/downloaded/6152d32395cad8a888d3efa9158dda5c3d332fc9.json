By comparing images taken over hours and days, the algorithms distinguished between stationary stars and galaxies and moons that hurtled around the planet.\n\nAt the birth of the solar system, vast amounts of dust and gas circling the sun coalesced into the eight known planets. But Sheppard believes that shortly after Saturn formed, more than 4bn years ago, passing asteroids and comets were captured by the planet\u2019s gravity and have circled it ever since.\n\nDepending on the angle of approach, comets and asteroids straying too close to Saturn in the early solar system would have become locked into radically different orbits around the planet. Only three of the new moons have so-called prograde orbits, meaning they circle Saturn in the same direction that it rotates. The other 17 are in retrograde orbits, meaning they orbit the planet backwards. One is the most distant moon ever spotted from the planet.\n\nNasa mission to Jupiter moon Europa moves step closer to launch Read more\n\nThe outer moons of Saturn fall into three broad families according to how they orbit the gas giant. Two of the new prograde moons appear to belong to a group that swings around Saturn at an angle of about 46 degrees. The moons, named after Inuit mythology, may once have belonged to one far larger moon that broke apart in the distant past.\n\nThe new retrograde moons appear to belong to another group named after Norse mythology and are also thought to be fragments of a much bigger parent moon that was smashed to pieces in the solar system\u2019s violent past.\n\n\u201cThis kind of grouping of outer moons is also seen around Jupiter, indicating violent collisions occurred between moons in the Saturnian system or with outside objects such as passing asteroids or comets,\u201d Sheppard said.\n\nThe discovery was announced on Monday by the International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Center.", "description": "The gas giant has 82 moons, surpassing the 79 known to orbit its larger neighbour", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d1d7ff06fa0ce8509da0a4bf8076e22701b283a/314_305_2233_1341/master/2233.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=803dcc10eec15f7f9968b6742985c2b2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
