That typically prompts lenders to make more loans, where they can charge interest rather than pay it, and to transfer the costs to their own clients.\n\nDoing so can broaden the effects of the negative-rate stimulus, prompting wealthy individuals and businesses to spend or invest money rather than park it in bank accounts where they are losing money.\n\nFive central banks currently have interest rates below zero: those in the countries of Japan, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland in addition to the European Central Bank.\n\nWhile Alan Greenspan, the former head of the U.S. central bank, warned in September that negative interest rates might spread to America, the Federal Reserve has so far shied away from them and Chairman Jerome Powell -- who now holds Greenspan's former role -- says they're not an \"ideal tool.\"\n\nThe charges will begin on Nov. 15 for Credit Suisse's corporate clients and on the first day of 2020 for private individuals.\n\nBank representatives didn't immediately respond to queries about how the negative rates would affect customers with holdings in currencies besides Swiss francs.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOther banks have recently begun assessing similar charges. The Financial Times has reported that UBS would apply a negative interest rate of 0.75% to customers who deposited more than 2 million Swiss francs. The Italian bank UniCredit plans to adopt negative rates, too, the newspaper said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Negative interest rates are sometimes used by central banks to boost a stagnant economy.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/2017-03-02T105642Z_1_LYNXMPED210OF_3_CREDIT-SUISSE-GP-RESULTS-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
