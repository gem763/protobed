He wore them and he couldn't stop scoring!' said Clancy.\n\n'Then he was playing Newcastle and he forgot them so he paid a taxi driver \u00a3600 to go and get them.'\n\nClancy and Crouch featured on Back of the Net along with comedian John Bishop (centre)\n\nCrouch realised before a Liverpool game against Newcastle he had not packed his lucky pants\n\nAn expensive taxi ride later the pants were retrieved, enabling the goalscoring run to continue\n\nThe trip from the north east down to Merseyside and back may have hit Crouch hard in the pocket, but the charismatic striker continued his scoring exploits nonetheless.\n\nClancy went onto discuss life with Crouch now he has hung up his boots.\n\nAsked whether she is enjoying life since her husband's retirement, she said: 'He's never at home.\n\n'He sold retirement to me saying we were going to go to the gym together, go to lunch together \u2013 I haven't seen him!'\n\nThe model also revealed Crouch is 'actually a really good poet.
