Recently, one haunted house visitor in Fremont, Ohio, Haley Jones, was left unnerved when an actor at Haunted Hydro drew on her face with a Sharpie and rubbed a spit-covered toy on her face.\n\nBesides unwanted physical contact, plot lines can also cross a line, such as the recent experience at Nightmare Vermont, which opened with an allusion to a school shooting. It included an actor named \"Jake,\u201d a student pulling a gun from a locker, and a mention of Fair Haven Union High School. The plot was similar to a terrifying real-life incident that occurred in 2018 when Jack Sawyer was arrested for allegedly planning to bring a firearm to Fair Haven Union High School and commit mass harm.\n\nBrooke Olsen-Farrell, Slate Valley Unified Union School District superintendent, complained about the scene, which has since been removed from the show. Olsen-Farrell tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the incident \"had a lasting impact on the community,\" and that the \"plot line surrounding Nightmare Vermont has been a disappointing setback in the healing process for our community.\"\n\nFrank T. McAndrew, a social psychologist and the Cornelia H. Dudley Professor of Psychology at Knox College, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that, while the Nightmare Vermont plot is in poor taste, he does not expect such a storyline \u2014 or the physical interaction that Jones experienced \u2014 to lead to lingering trauma, especially since participants visited the haunted house willingly.\n\nBut is that the same case with the infamous McKamey Manor?\n\nSome extreme thrill-seekers have found themselves signing a 40-page contract to (hopefully) experience 10 hours of psychological torture in order to win $20,000. However, not a single visitor of McKamey Manor in Summertown, Tenn., has completed the tour without calling it quits with the required safe word. In fact, some online communities question whether the prize money even really exists, or if McKamey Manor is just banking on torturing people to the breaking point every time.\n\nRuss McKamey, the owner and operator of McKamey Manor, describes himself as a \"happy-go-lucky kind of guy.\" He's charming and affable, but he also runs what is widely considered the world's scariest haunted house, where survivors are chained, buried alive, or are forced to face other types of torture in the \"survival horror\" haunt.\n\n\"The big misconception about me is I\u2019m this crazy, psycho guy when in reality I\u2019m a super conservative guy,\" McKamey tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \"Never been drunk in my life, never had a cigarette in my entire life, never had a cup of coffee even. I don\u2019t even cuss.\"\n\nIf a survivor does use profanity inside the attraction, which would be hard even for a nun to avoid if she were upside down in a cage surrounded by moray eels \u2014 an experience at McKamey Manor \u2014 then $500 would be deducted from their theoretically potential prize of $20,000.\n\nAccording to McKamey, the Manor has been around, in one form or another, for 40 years, but he estimates it wasn't until around 2010 that it really started to take off when he opened the extreme haunt on his San Diego property. Eventually, the attraction moved to Summertown, Tenn.\n\n\"It didn\u2019t matter if I was in the Navy on ships or in a one-bedroom apartment, I was always building a haunt someplace,\" McKamey says. \"It escalated to all this craziness. It progressed to what it is now.\"\n\nMcKamey estimates he has put more than a million dollars into the Manor \u2014 and to visit, people only have to pay by bringing a bag of dog food, given to his five rescue dogs or the local shelter.\n\n\"I'm not a very good businessman,\" McKamey jokes.\n\nBut getting the chance to complete the haunt and come out $20,000 richer is not easy. McKamey estimates over 27,000 people are currently on the waiting list, with the number growing as the attraction gains in popularity. There aren't that many chances to experience the show, as McKamey puts on just one show each week due to the \"demanding\" nature of the performance.\n\nThe vetting process is also incredibly intense, according to McKamey.", "description": "Being buried alive, swimming with snakes, and being hung upside down in a cage are part of the experience at McKamey Manor, which some call a place of torture, while others call it fun.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wmWTMbXbS1WzYaXnbQwN9w--~B/aD03MjA7dz05MTc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/meredith_videos_131/cccaa41c8aa5dc5855e2ef69fe2830ea", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
