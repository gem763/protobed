It\u2019s known for its silky, resilient properties and is often used for luxury jumpers, cardigans, coats and scarves.\n\nHowever, mohair has dominated the headlines over recent years due to reports of severe animal cruelty, such as being mutilated in order for the fluffy mohair to be produced, according to PETA. Footage released by the organisation showed the animals being harmed and handled violently at farms in South Africa.\n\nMany high street brands such as H&M, Zara, GAP and more have all pledged to stop ordering and selling mohair products, as a direct result of this investigation.\n\nDo you read the labels on your knitwear? (Picture: Getty Images/EyeEm/TY LIM)\n\nCashmere\n\nKnown for its silky fibres, cashmere is widely considered to be one the most luxurious wool materials.\n\nIt\u2019s also rare \u2013 on average, it takes around three to four goats to make just one regular jumper, which is why the price tag is usually so high.\n\nResearch has found that the goats are forced to have winter shearings at a time when they most need their coats. As a result, they are exposed to harsh winter temperatures with little protection.\n\nA number of brands, such a Stella McCartney and Patagonia, have been working solely with a recycled version of the fibre, which involves using post-factory waste. Stella McCartney has even banned \u2018virgin\u2019 cashmere entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwedish retailer Arket has also said that cashmere production must be handled more responsibly and uses \u2018recycled\u2019 cashmere.\n\nMerino\n\nMerino wool is known for its softness and breathability, as well as temperature-regulating properties.\n\nHowever, collecting merino wool can sometimes involve a process called mulesing, a practice which involves removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep, to prevent a condition called flystrike (where flies lay eggs, which hatch into maggots who subsequently \u2018eat\u2019 the sheep\u2019s flesh).\n\nIt\u2019s a very painful procedure and, worryingly, animal campaigners have said that more than 20 million merino breed lambs are currently mulesed each year.\n\nOf course, there are a number of fashion brands that source their merino wool ethically \u2013 without mulesing \u2013 and many are keen to be transparent about production.\n\nNew Zealand-based brand Icebreaker was the first brand to pioneer a \u2018Baa Code\u2019, where customers could track how their garment was made from start to finish.\n\nIt\u2019s always worth taking a closer look into the brand you want to buy merino wool from, and read up on the measures they taking to help with animal welfare.\n\nEthical choices\n\nIn terms of wool, alpaca is thought to be one of the most ethical, as the animals are not harmed during the shearing process and can continue to produce wool for many years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, alpaca farming does generally not involve harsh chemicals \u2013 so the process is safe and natural for both the farmers and the environment.\n\nBuying second-hand wool products is another option to consider, or opting for brands that champion recycled wool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople Tree, Ally Bee and Flock By Nature are a few brands that promote ethical wool production. Likewise, Cornish brand Finisterre was the first brand to produce merino wool in the UK, from non-mulesed merino sheep.\n\nSo, in terms of ethics, mohair and cashmere appear to be the worst offenders, with merino following behind and alpaca at the top.\n\nSome people argue that sheep shearing is a natural process of farming and \u2013 as long as animals are not harmed in the process \u2013 there should be nothing wrong with wool production.\n\nHowever, wool is still an animal by-product, so it\u2019s likely that animal campaigners will continue to urge the industry to boycott it entirely.\n\nMORE: How to have a sustainable Halloween\n\nMORE: How to make your coffee habit more sustainable\n\nMORE: How to become a more sustainable parent\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "We've rounded up the different types of wool and the ethical concerns around them, so everyone can make their own choices this winter.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92979698_1572283244.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
