Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois, who suggested that the plan to recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was benefiting shareholders rather than U.S. taxpayers.\n\n\u2018If the circumstances present itself to where we have to wipe out the shareholders, we will.\u2019 \u2014 Federal Housing Finance Agency director Mark Calabria\n\n\u201cI agree completely that we should have and we should still wipe out these shareholders,\u201d Foster responded.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 5 major changes the Trump administration wants to make to housing finance\n\nWhen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s troubles emerged amid the 2008 financial crisis, many thought that the mortgage giants\u2019 shareholders would suffer losses as the government sought to bail the firms out. Instead, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s common and preferred shares have continued trading, even as the mortgage giants went into conservatorship.\n\nSince entering conservatorship, the two companies have sent most of their earnings to the U.S. government to pay back the money they received in bailout funds. But that left the two companies with little money on hand to handle potential losses in the event of a future housing market downturn. Calabria frequently noted that Fannie and Freddie were operating at leverage ratios of 500 to 1, while most major banks are only allowed to maintain leverage ratios of 10 to 1.\n\n\u201cEven if every single loan Fannie and Freddie made were pristine, they would still fail at that level of leverage\u201d in the event of a downturn, Calabria said.\n\nRecently, the Trump administration has signaled its interest in ending the conservatorship of the two companies, as outlined in reform plans put forth by the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development last month.\n\nRead more: FHFA says Fannie and Freddie must direct over one-third of multifamily loans towards affordable housing\n\nA major piece of this plan is recapitalizing Fannie and Freddie \u2014 the FHFA has already moved in this direction by reducing the amount of money Fannie and Freddie must \u201csweep\u201d to the Treasury Department.\n\nFoster, however, expressed concern that allowing Fannie and Freddie to keep this money would enrich shareholders rather than protect taxpayers, citing increases in the companies\u2019 share prices as evidence.\n\nHe was not the only person to cite the Fannie and Freddie\u2019s share prices during the hearing. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, raised the subject, noting that Fannie and Freddie\u2019s share prices increased substantially following Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing in which he said releasing Fannie and Freddie to the private sector was a priority.\n\n\u201cI think it was clear the market didn\u2019t understand my comments and what they implied,\u201d Mnuchin, who was also in attendance at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, said in response to Ocasio-Cortez.", "description": "The comment came during a congressional hearing regarding the Trump administration\u2019s housing finance reform plans.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT807_calabr_ZG_20191022152336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
