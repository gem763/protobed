As students staged a walkout to protest the decision, former U.S. education secretary Arne Duncan blasted it as \u201cmore evidence our country still can\u2019t handle issues of race and racism.\u201d Amid the backlash came a conversation about the effectiveness of a district policy that forbids the use of offensive language, no matter the context.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnderson, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, said many students have used the n-word against him in his 11 years with the district, and he has always explained its history and meaning. He\u2019s determined to get his job back.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I feel I was being called a derogatory term and I don\u2019t want to be called that because my mother, my father, my grandparents \u2014 they were called this word and could not say, \u2018Don\u2019t call me that,\u2019\u201d Anderson told the Journal Sentinel. \u201cI\u2019m the first generation in my family who can literally look you in the eye and say don\u2019t call me that word. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to try to take that from me.\u201d\n\nEven Cher weighed in, offering on Twitter to cover Anderson\u2019s legal fees should he decide to sue the district.\n\nAD\n\nHow Can Ppl Be This Disrespectful\u2049\ufe0fA Beloved,Man of Color Just Passed,& Our Nations Mourning Him.Cong.Elijah Cummings FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE.He Was loved & Feared. If You Want To sue MMSD Ed.Board I Will Incur Your expenses.\ud83d\udd4aEC \u2014 Cher (@cher) October 18, 2019\n\nThe incident that led to Anderson\u2019s firing happened on Oct. 9. Anderson told the Journal Sentinel he was escorting an unruly student out of West High School when the student began lobbing the n-word at him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery type of n-word you can think of, that\u2019s what he was calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, do not call me that name. I\u2019m not your n-word. Do not call me that.\u201d\n\nThe principal, Karen Boran, later told Anderson he had \u201can uphill battle\u201d to keep his job, the Journal Sentinel reported. On Wednesday, she said in a letter to parents that a staff member would not be coming back to school following an investigation of the matter. \u201cRegardless of context or circumstance,\u201d she wrote, \u201cracial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Anderson said the policy is wrongheaded.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t eliminate racism by ignoring it \u2014 by trying to hide the word or by trying to legislate the word,\u201d he said, according to the Journal Sentinel. \u201cWhat if a white student calls a black student an n-word, but doesn\u2019t say the word? It\u2019s the intent behind what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOutrage over Anderson\u2019s firing built quickly. A petition calling for his reinstatement went up Thursday on Change.org, drawing thousands of signatures. Supporters wrote that Anderson \u201cmade connections with students that will never be forgotten\u201d and that his termination is \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nMadison Teachers Incorporated, the local teachers union, said it had filed a grievance on his behalf, seeking his reinstatement with back pay. In the meantime, Anderson\u2019s co-workers at West High School set up a fundraiser for his family on GoFundMe.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn a school of over 2,300 students and 200 staff, Marlon has the desire and uncanny ability to remember every single person\u2019s name,\u201d they wrote in the fundraiser\u2019s description. \u201cHe can read what each person needs with a simple look, and generously fills that need with love: a kind word, a silly song, a loving-but-firm warning.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, students got involved. Hundreds left their classrooms and marched two miles to the district\u2019s offices, the Journal Sentinel reported. They held signs with messages like \u201cBlack staff matter!\u201d and \u201cContext matters!\u201d\n\nThe president of the school board, Gloria Reyes, told the Associated Press in a statement that she wants the board to review the zero-tolerance policy. She also wants Anderson\u2019s grievance handled quickly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly difficult situation, and we acknowledge the emotion, harm and complexity involved,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cMany people in our community and our district are grappling with that complexity, and we will continue to do so as we go forward.\u201d\n\nAnderson, who is insulin dependent and worried about the loss of his health insurance, watched the protest unfold on social media. On his Facebook page, he wrote that he had cried so much \u201cmy head lost weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the love,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I get back I will personally walk everybody to class ON TIME!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "School officials pointed to a zero-tolerance policy on employee use of racial slurs, a news report said.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g8Qkq20TYl4psJebwWI8epNfDO4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FZIY2CXRZII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
