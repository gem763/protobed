It conjures the impeachment drama, 45 years ago, surrounding a U.S. president. Brokaw\u2019s subject used nefarious means to undermine his opponents, lied promiscuously in his own defense and excoriated the press as the font of his self-inflicted woes.\n\nWho does this sound like? \u201cI have never heard or seen such outrageous, vicious, distorted reporting in 27 years of public life.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Fall of Richard Nixon: A Reporter Remembers Watergate\u201d (Random House, 240 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four stars), the author doesn\u2019t overplay the parallels between now and then. He doesn\u2019t need to. As Yogi Berra once observed in another context, \u201cIt\u2019s like deja vu all over again.\u201d\n\nBrokaw had a front-row seat to the Watergate scandal when, at the tender age of 33, he was named NBC\u2019s White House correspondent in the summer of 1973. The infamous break-in had occurred in June of 1972, and Nixon would resign the presidency on August 9, 1974.\n\nThe author, formerly the anchor of \"NBC Nightly News\" for more than two decades, has written an engaging account of a nation in turmoil. It is a breezy, often gossipy and at times surprising memoir that encompasses more than Watergate.\n\nMore:Prince memoir 'The Beautiful Ones' offers a glimpse inside the mind of a musical genius\n\nFor example, Brokaw was walking closely behind Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, during the first of two attempts on that president\u2019s life, both in September 1975. In fact, Brokaw immediately recognized the woman whom the Secret Service subdued from his days as a TV journalist in Los Angeles: Lynne \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme, a disciple of Charles Manson.\n\nThe author takes the reader not only inside a beleaguered White House, but also into tony Georgetown salons where the political and cultural glitterati mingled with journalists and ruminated on the scandal du jour. It was a glamorous life for a 30-something journalist who hailed from South Dakota.\n\nThis book also reminds the reader of how far Nixon fell because of high and foolhardy crimes and misdemeanors. When Watergate\u2019s keystone criminals struck on June 17, 1972, Nixon\u2019s likely reelection opponent was a little-known senator from South Dakota, George McGovern. The incumbent would trounce his hapless challenger in November, winning 49 of 50 states and more than 60% of the popular vote. Landslide isn\u2019t a strong-enough word for it.\n\nYet less than two years later, Nixon would be forced to resign when impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction in the Senate became a foregone conclusion.\n\nAmong the delicious tidbits herein is that in 1969 future felon Bob Halderman offered Brokaw the job of being Nixon\u2019s press secretary. Also noteworthy is that during Watergate there were more than a few standup members of the loyal opposition, like senators Bill Cohen of Maine and Howard Baker of Tennessee, who were willing from the get-go to follow the evidence wherever it led.\n\nHere\u2019s another intriguing historical factoid: it was only two months before Nixon\u2019s resignation \u2013 after two years of Watergate coverage \u2013 that polls showed for the first time that a majority of American favored impeachment. That popular milestone has nearly been reached with regards to our current president: A 55% majority of registered voters said they approved of the impeachment inquiry, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nIn addition to chronicling Nixon\u2019s misdeeds, Brokaw also touches on his accomplishments, which were often overshadowed by Watergate, among them his swift and steadfast support of a beleaguered Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\nA note of caution is warranted. While this slim book leaves the reader wanting more pages, it also suffers from choppy prose and lax editing in places. Often dates and pertinent details are left out, such as the year and month when the Arab oil embargo began.\n\nThat said, this book should be required reading inside the Beltway, and beyond.", "description": "Tom Brokaw's \"The Fall of Richard Nixon\" is a breezy, often gossipy\u00a0and at times surprising memoir that encompasses more than Watergate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/29/USAT/c5d63c4f-63bf-411a-8eb3-323e5f27b6ae-THE_FALL_OF_RICHARD_NIXON.jpg?crop=1687,2249,x0,y149&width=1488&height=2249&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
