Pettigano, North Jersey Record\n\nIn Pittsburgh, a synagogue searches for ways to heal a year after a mass shooting killed 11 members. It was a Saturday morning \u2014 the sabbath.\n\nHe knows he has to look ahead now and plan for the memorials and mourning. After all, that's what rabbis are supposed to do. They remember. They mourn. They help us move on.\n\nBut Rabbi Jeffrey Myers has a problem: What's the right path to healing after a mass shooting?\n\nToday, Oct. 27, it is one a year since a man, armed with a belly full of anti-Semitic hatred and the kind of semi-automatic weaponry that United States Navy SEALs carry into battle, stormed into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. It was a Saturday morning \u2014 the sabbath. People had gathered to praise God and just find a few moments of spiritual peace.\n\nIn this Oct. 28, 2018, file photo, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, right, of Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha Congregation hugs Rabbi Cheryl Klein, left, of Dor Hadash Congregation and Rabbi Jonathan Perlman during a community gathering held in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. As the Jewish community grieved, Myers took a leading role during public memorials and presided over seven funerals in the space of less than a week. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\nWhen the man stopped shooting, 11 worshipers, some of them old enough to remember the Holocaust, were dead.\n\nWhat came to be known \u2014 ironically \u2014 as the \u201cTree of Life Massacre\u201d was not the worst mass shooting in American history. It wasn\u2019t even the worst in 2018 when our nation was targeted with 323 mass shootings. Remember that blood-spattered high school in Florida?\n\nTree of Life Synagogue | Pittsburg, Pennsylvania | Oct. 27, 2018 | 11 dead | 7 wounded (Photo: Cara Owsley/The Enquirer)\n\nBut, as with the killing of 17 students and teachers on Feb. 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the murders at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue seemed to push America\u2019s struggle with gun violence down a deeper and more tragic hole. Not even a school or a house of God on the sabbath could be spared from gun violence. What was America becoming?\n\nA year later\n\nNow, amid another bloody year and a rising public outcry, with more than 250 mass shootings already recorded in places as diverse as a government office building in Virginia Beach, a Walmart in El Paso and a historic district in Dayton, here was Rabbi Myers.\n\nOn a morning in August, Myers was trying to plan a memorial service for his wounded congregation.\n\nA makeshift memorial stands outside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Oct. 29 in the aftermath of a deadly shooting in Pittsburgh. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)\n\n\u201cThere are so many challenges,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWhat is the right thing to do? What are things that will be meaningful to people?\u201d\n\nWe spoke via Skype from his temporary office at Pittsburgh's Rodef Shalom synagogue. The building that was home to Tree of Life and two other Jewish congregations has been closed since the shootings. Myers says his congregation is still discussing what to do with the place.\n\nIs it even appropriate to worship there anymore? The blood has been wiped away. Erasing the memories is much more difficult, however.\n\nI lived, but my life was changed forever: I survived an anti-Semitic shooting. I know how hate armed with a gun turns deadly.\n\nMyers, whose father was a municipal judge, was born in Newark and grew up in suburban Roselle, New Jersey. Rather than following his father into the law after graduating from Rutgers University, Myers, a gifted singer, decided to become a Jewish cantor or \u201chazzan.\u201d\n\nAfter stints as a cantor at synagogues in Long Island and near Atlantic City \u2014 and additional studies to become a rabbi \u2014 he moved to the Tree of Life congregation as both rabbi and cantor in August 2017.\n\nFourteen months later, he found himself with another role \u2014 as another American voice trying to make sense of the nation's mounting bloodbath of mass shootings.\n\nA woman pays her respects at a makeshift memorial in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Oct. 29, 2018. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\nThe world first saw Myers on the day of the shooting. A news photograph showed him being rushed from the synagogue by a police officer. He was still clad in his prayer shawl after leading morning services.\n\nIn the ensuing days, Myers, a soft-spoken man with a neatly trimmed gray beard and eyes that seem to mirror his emotions, gave numerous TV interviews.\n\nHe enthusiastically praised the police who rushed to the scene, especially the four cops wounded by gunfire. He hosted a tense, nationally televised visit by President Donald Trump and his family to the synagogue. And he presided at the funerals of his murdered worshipers, referring to them as martyrs for their faith.\n\nMyers\u2019 efforts did not go unnoticed. One admirer dubbed him \u201cAmerica\u2019s rabbi.\u201d\n\nBut Myers was wounded, too.\n\nEx-Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff: A year after Tree of Life, America is confronting domestic terror threat head-on\n\nDuring a funeral for the oldest victim \u2014 a 97-year-old woman \u2014 he collapsed in tears on a bench as he read psalms and followed the coffin to a hearse.\n\nAs the days spilled into 2019 and the media circus that descended on his synagogue left for other mass shootings, Myers cut back on his interviews. One of his aides said that just talking about the tragedy resurrects the pain and trauma. Plus, Myers had a congregation he wanted to try to heal \u2013 if that was even possible.\n\nHe agreed to speak to the USA TODAY NETWORK on the condition that he would not be asked to relive that terrible day. But he readily conceded that he can\u2019t avoid the first anniversary, not to mention the approaching Jewish high holy days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.\n\nRabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha Congregation stands across the street from the synagogue in Pittsburgh, Monday, Oct. 29, 2018.

(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also mindful of the fact that no matter what we do this is going to be an emotionally laden day,\u201d Myers said. \u201cNot a good day. There\u2019s no other way to say that. So how does one give the proper honor and respect to 11 deceased but yet find something positive out of that, that we\u2019re not merely about mourning and suffering but we can find some ways to gain strength and continue the healing process?\"\n\nHe paused, then added: \u201cYou know, we\u2019re struggling with how do you answer those questions.\u201d\n\nMyers said he begins each day with a question of God: What do you want me to do?\n\nHe hasn\u2019t found the all-encompassing answer yet. Still, he finds the process comforting, in particular his reading of Psalm 121 and its iconic opening lines: \u201cI lift up my eyes to the hills \u2014 from where will my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber.\u201d\n\nTree of Life anniversary: American Jews see rising anti-Semitism in alarming new survey\n\n\u201cThe psalm is my instruction manual, right there in terms of how and what,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI turn to God every day for inspiration to tell me. OK God, what is it that you need me to do today? What do you need me to say? Give me some hints. What can I do to try to help people heal, to try to make the world a slightly better place than it was the day before?\u201d\n\nRabbi Jeffrey Myers watches the installation of a menorah outside the Tree of Life Synagogue before holding a celebration on the first night of Hanukkah, Sunday, Dec. 2, 2018, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

Puskar, AP)\n\nNot long after the shootings, Myers wondered why he had been placed at the Tree of Life synagogue. Like clergy of other faiths, Myers felt he had been called to serve in Pittsburgh. But why? And in what role?\n\n\u201cI think it was part of the healing process for me to be able to say there has to be higher purpose towards why I\u2019m here,\u201d Myers said. \u201cFirst off, why am I in Pittsburgh? God clearly had some sort of plan.\u201d\n\nBut what was that plan anyway?\n\nH-speech\n\nMyers says he gained a hint during a rally for peace weeks after the shooting.\n\nA large crowd had gathered at the city\u2019s Point State Park. Myers was asked to speak. Looking back, he says he felt empty, worn out. What else could he say?\n\nThen an idea came to him. Why not say something about hate speech? Only Myers wanted to find a new term to describe the incendiary rhetoric that continually gushed from so many corners of America.\n\nHe did not want to use the term, \u201chate speech.\u201d Off the cuff, as he approached the podium, he came up with \u201cH-speech.\u201d\n\nJared Kushner, center, and Ivanka Trump, left, greet Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, right, as they arrive with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump outside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue. (Photo: ANDREW HARNIK/AP)\n\n\"The word hate is a four letter word,\" Myers said. \"And like other four letter words, it\u2019s an obscenity and we just don\u2019t use that word in public or even in private. And I found that when we use that word, it\u2019s an extreme word that\u2019s fraught with much emotion. When our words become emotional, they frequently lead to violent acts. If we can tone down our speech, we can tone down the things that we do.\u201d\n\nFinding ways to convince people to focus on \"H-speech\" became Myers\u2019 mission.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying awake at night, thinking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just came to me from God that this was what I need to say.\u201d\n\nTo Myers, words matter. As a rabbi, he knew that, of course. But the massacre at his synagogue opened his eyes to the toxic power of words \u2014 in particular, words that provide the impetus for angry people to pick up guns.\n\nMyers has deliberately stopped using the word, \u201chate,\u201d and has shortened it to just a single letter \u2013 \u201cH.\u201d He won\u2019t even say that he \u201chates spinach\u201d or that he \u201chates\u201d a particular sports team.\n\n\u201cWords can wound and words can heal,\u201d Myers explained. \u201cI submit we that we need to find more ways to find words that can heal.\u201d\n\nHolding candles, a group of girls wait for the start of a memorial vigil in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh for the victims of the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar/AP)\n\nHe admits that his campaign may seem to some a bit idealistic \u2014 maybe odd, too. So be it. Myers says he is willing to follow this course.\n\nThe problems with gun violence, he insists, are not just about guns. It\u2019s about anger and hated \u2014 not to mention misunderstanding, too. And the perpetrators are not just Trump followers \u2014 or even right-wing nationalists.\n\n\u201cThere is \u2018H\u2019 on all sides \u2014 Republicans, Democrats, independents,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this goes far beyond politics. This is about our own humanity. Yes, there can be politicians who espouse h-speech through one means or another. And I think there are many who model uncivil discourse. But, to me, it\u2019s not about any specific act that we do but it\u2019s more about the root cause. I think if we can focus on the root cause, you can begin to create change.\u201d\n\nThe anniversary\n\nEach day, Myers, who is married and the father of a son and daughter, places a button on the left lapel of his suit jacket \u2014 a rendition of the Pittsburgh Steelers' football logo of three, four-pointed stars inside a circle. But Myers\u2019 button contains a six-pointed Star of David. The button has become an informal logo for the Tree of Life congregation and its steely resolve to keep going through all the hardship.\n\nWhich brings Myers back to the task at hand \u2014 trying to figure out a way to commemorate the first anniversary of the shooting and to also shepherd his congregation through the upcoming services of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.\n\nThere is no guide or playbook, he says. Only instinct and hope.\n\nHe smiles, then turns somber again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re writing the book,\u201d Myers said, adding that he hopes he is the last to use it.\n\n\u201cWe hope that it never gets opened again,\" he said, \"and that it gathers dust in some corner somewhere.\u201d\n\nMike Kelly is a columnist for the North Jersey Record, where this column originally appeared.
