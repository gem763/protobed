Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s \u201cShark Tank,\u201d two golfing entrepreneurs sought to bring style to the course and struck a hole in one with the sharks.\n\nRiding in on a golf cart, Tyler Stuart and John Krosky entered the tank asking for $300,000 for an 8% stake of their company Golfkicks. Gone are traditional golf cleats. By inserting plastic cleats into the sole of the shoe, Golfkicks can turn any sneaker, flip-flop or boot into golf shoes.\n\n\u201cThe problem we tackle is people are just tired of golf shoes,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, uncomfortable, expensive.\u201d\n\nThe Denver entrepreneurs sold out their first version of their product, and the two are working on a more durable, improved version that doesn\u2019t require digging small pilot holes in the shoe\u2019s sole to insert the cleats.\n\nTyler Stuart demonstrates how sneakers become golf shoes by adding cleats in a 'Shark Tank' pitch that had two investors clamoring to buy in.

Why don\u2019t you ask for a cool $5 million?\u201d John said. Because he's not a golfer, John didn\u2019t think the product was a good fit. \u201cWhy does anyone play golf? Because I hate it. Here\u2019s my general thought about it. You want a partner who\u2019s obviously passionate about that stuff. I don\u2019t relate to this business at all.\u201d\n\nGuest shark Mark Higgins agreed.\n\nShark Lori Greiner nails a putt during the Golfkicks pitch on ABC's 'Shark Tank.' (Photo: Jessica Brooks, ABC)\n\nNavigating the tricky distribution system associated with golf products made shark Kevin O\u2019Leary pause. Based on Stuart and Krosky\u2019s valuation, Mr. Wonderful didn\u2019t think Golfkicks was worth the required effort: \u201cI\u2019m looking at it saying,\u2018I wish it wasn\u2019t $300,000.\u2019 Because it\u2019s a product. It isn\u2019t really a company yet. The way you structured the deal makes it hard for me to maneuver.\u201d\n\nA passionate golfer, shark Lori Greiner liked the company\u2019s product but found it a risky investment. Greiner would give them the $300,000 as a loan with 8% interest rate for 5% of the company. She also wanted a $1 royalty on every until sold until the loan is repaid.\n\n\u201cListen, you\u2019re brand new,\u201d Greiner said. \u201cYou\u2019re just starting. You don\u2019t even have down the final iteration, which I would think you have that coming any day.\u201d\n\nGiven Golfkick\u2019s high margins, John questioned why she asked for such a low royalty, and when Stuart and Krosky didn\u2019t immediately respond, Greiner decided to increase it to $2 per unit for keeping her waiting.\n\nTyler Stuart and John Krosky, entrepreneurs from Denver, Colorado, transform sneakers into golf shoes on ABC's 'Shark Tank.' (Photo: Jessica Brooks, ABC)\n\nShark Mark Cuban found a royalty to be ridiculous. Though not a huge fan of golfing, Cuban saw value for the company in the realm of kids sports. He offered them the $300,000 for a 15% stake: \u201cOnce you get into kids sports, that\u2019s where I think your grand slam is.\u201d\n\nStuart and Krosky countered with 12%, but agreed to a deal with Cuban for a 13% stake.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some money,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot of fun, guys. I might even get back on the course.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/28/shark-tank-golfkicks-scores-deal-adding-cleats-shoes/4089004002/", "description": "While the rest weren't exactly golfers, two 'Shark Tank' investors were captivated by Golfkicks, a product that turns regular shoes into golfwear.", "authors": ["Matthew Wilson", "Special To Usa Today", "Published P.M.
