I was in the north to train sled dogs, which meant that, as winter covered autumn\u2019s colors on the tundra, I and a team of eight or 10 dogs were constantly in the bush.\n\nAs an 18-year-old from Iowa, I had everything to learn: how to harness dogs so eager to run that they were barking, leaping, wriggling blurs, incorrigible with glee. How to tie a proper knot. Where to find dry branches for a quick fire. How to walk with snowshoes and not fall every third step. Some frustrations\u2014as when one dog chewed through her harness while I, bent over and sweating, struggled to get another ready\u2014made me weep. It was a rare day when I was not sore. My biceps grew so quickly from wrestling dogs and sleds and frozen 40-pound salmon to feed my team that my pinky and ring fingers went numb, the nerves pinched by new muscle. But the pain and irritation of incompetence distracted me from a homesickness so profound, I imagined it walked beside me, a lumbering dark presence. I woke every morning cloaked in its despair.\n\nGradually, as the dogs became stronger and I less likely to die from my own inexperience, we mushed farther from town. It was in the bush, usually with dogs and usually without other people, that I learned how to navigate by memorizing the bends in rivers or the angle of a hillside, and how to read the gestures of my team for tiredness or excitement. I came to know the dogs as individuals, with likes and strengths and quirks, and they began to trust me, the leaders listening when I asked them to turn right or left, the whole group howling and running in circles of joy at the sight of a harness. As a team, our trips went from 10 miles to 30 to 70. Each run submerged us deep in the beauty of the open country, the wide skies and hills that, covered in snow, were 10,000 shades of white and gray and crystalline blue. The homesickness began to fade\u2014or rather, the bush began to feel like home.\n\nRead: Another brutal fact about the ice-age arctic: the hyenas\n\nBut it was a home struck through with fear. Take the afternoon one February or March\u2014late enough in the winter that the days had hours of light in them again\u2014when I rounded a bend in the river, the dogs going steady, only to see a cow moose 20 or 30 yards ahead. I knew enough by then for the fear to take no calculation: A bull can weigh 1,500 pounds, a cow nearly 1,000. Large enough that, faced with wolves, moose will either flee or trample their canine attackers. To a moose, my dog team was indistinguishable from a wolf pack.\n\nSo she charged. The distance between her hooves and my lead dogs diminished in a spray of snow. The dogs, filled with hunting drive and beyond entreaty from me, bolted to meet her. I could see the white of the moose\u2019s eye, her head rearing back, her breath steaming in the cold air. Twenty feet, then 10. She had the pivotal choice: to stamp into my team, and into me, or to turn.", "description": "Living north of the Arctic Circle meant learning fear and its power to motivate in the face of danger\u2014whether from a bear or climate change.", "authors": ["Bathsheba Demuth"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_917562312/facebook.jpg?1568736529", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
