That Face", "language": "en", "text": "Photos: BMW\n\nBMW recently unveiled the Concept 4, whose name might not resonate because it was probably hard to get past the vehicle\u2019s glaring grille in order to read the details. But even if the rest of the world thought the front of the car looked like the snout of a giant radioactive pig, BMW is standing behind it.\n\nBMW has to move forward, you see, and at BMW, forward means outward. Its grilles keep getting bigger, and the rest of us keep shrinking in fear, hoping they won\u2019t haunt us in our dreams.\n\nAutocar talked to BMW design boss Adrian van Hooydonk about the choice to make the Concept 4 grille larger than a sinkhole that could swallow the car itself, saying that it\u2019s hard to make changes while successful but that you have to because if you fall behind, catching back up turns into \u201cpanic mode.\u201d\n\nStaying ahead of panic mode apparently means forming a grille large enough to swallow the possibility whole, at BMW. To each their own.\n\nFrom Autocar:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a psychologist but I know BMW is a brand that not only has customers, it has fans. They know our entire design history and have strong opinions on that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing, it means we have really connected with these people on an emotional level. OK, I know that there might be some discussion with fans because they\u2019ve grown to love what you\u2019ve just done and you\u2019re changing it already. \u201cAs a company, you have to keep moving,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe minute you start standing still, you become an easy target. [...]\u201d\n\nYou know what\u2019s an easy target? Nah, forget it, that joke is too easy.\n\nVan Hooydonk vent on, saying that the idea for the future of BMW design is to focus on certain elements and have those elements play \u201ca bigger role\u201d \u2014 an approach only really uncontroversial when taken with rear wings.\n\nHe also hinted that the Concept 4 will likely closely preview the upcoming 4 Series, which is to be expected \u2014 like with the i8, BMW is good at staying close to the concepts.\n\nFrom Autocar:\n\nDescribing the 4 Series specifically, van Hooydonk said: \u201cIt is a sporty coup\u00e9, and by definition it has to have a very expressive design, and you see that all around the car, not just the front. But there are not that many lines or elements \u2013 it\u2019s not a complex design. \u201cWe want to do this for all our cars: we want to have fewer elements, then each element you use plays a bigger role.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this is a good thing for BMW. If its grilles eventually morph into black holes from sheer gravitational pull, then they will be able to swallow up every other automaker in existence, thus eliminating the competition.\n\nIt\u2019s a solid business strategy.\n\n[h/t to Carscoops]", "description": "BMW recently unveiled the Concept 4, whose name might not resonate because it was probably hard to get past the vehicle\u2019s glaring grille in order to read the details.
