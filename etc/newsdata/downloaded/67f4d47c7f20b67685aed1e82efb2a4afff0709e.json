If Roan hadn\u2019t been born when he was she wouldn\u2019t be here. He saved her life.\u2019\n\nSince becoming a mum, Megan has undergone four surgeries and was under the knife for nine and a half hours in her most recent operation and doctors have said there is nothing more they can do for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDenise said: \u2018We are absolutely devastated and I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ve managed to hold it together but the adrenaline has kicked in. We\u2019re taking it every day at a time and we have gone through every emotion possible but we are not going to give up or listen to the doctors.\u2019\n\nMegan Lavery and her partner Paul Sweeney who has given up his job to care for her.\n\nThe family are now organising a fundraiser to pay for a course of alternative treatment for Megan and support Denise and Megan\u2019s boyfriend, Paul, who have both stopped working to care for her and the family outlook remains resolutely positive.\n\nThey\u2019re funding a drug called Penoxal which has given her energy and meant she is able to do things with her son.\n\nDenise said: \u2018Megan and Paul made a pact that if she survived they would get married and that is what they are now doing. The family are looking to the future.\u2019\n\nYou can donate to the fundraiser by clicking here\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
