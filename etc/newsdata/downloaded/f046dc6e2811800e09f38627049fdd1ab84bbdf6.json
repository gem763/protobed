They point to its weakness", "language": "en", "text": "American socialists were given some good news this week when Bernie Sanders, hot off the heels of a stellar debate performance, received some of the most sought-after endorsements of the primary race. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, one quarter of \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2013 a group of four Democratic Congresswoman of color who have been vilified by President Trump a number of times \u2013 officially endorsed Sanders for president and released a video explaining her reasons. It has been widely reported that fellow Squad members Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will publicly follow suit this weekend.\n\nTo receive endorsements from the youngest woman ever elected to congress (Ocasio-Cortez) and the first Muslim women elected to congress (Omar and Tlaib) is a major coup for Sanders, whose supporters are often unfairly and inaccurately characterised as being white, male \u201cBernie bros\u201d. But in politics, when someone chooses to publicly endorse a candidate can be just as revealing as the endorsement itself. And the timing of these endorsements signals that, at this stage in the campaign, Sanders isn\u2019t doing as well as he\u2019d hoped.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is unusual for prominent figures within the Democratic party to endorse candidates this early in a primary contest. As it stands, the primary is essentially a three-horse race between Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, but there are still over 10 candidates seeking the nomination. The bulk of endorsements \u2013 particularly high-profile, influential ones \u2013 tend to come when there are two distinctly different candidates remaining. But even then, it\u2019s not uncommon for leading Democrats to stay quiet. Warren, for example, didn\u2019t publicly pick between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in 2016. Neither did then-president Barack Obama (despite the fact that he reportedly begged Clinton, his former secretary of state, to run for the position).\n\nPolitical endorsements are a fascinating tool. If timed right, they can be a devastating blow to an opponent that creates a ripple effect across politics. High-profile Democrats, many of them Clinton allies, informing Hillary that they intended to endorse Obama was said to be the final nail in her 2008 campaign\u2019s coffin, convincing her to drop out soon after.\n\nSo why have these endorsements been announced so early? Ocasio-Cortez in particular has become one of the most well-known figures in the Democratic party in just two years. It is likely that Warren \u2013 seen by many as the most left-wing candidate besides Sanders \u2013 had tried hard to woo her. AOC\u2019s endorsement could have really hurt Warren\u2019s campaign if delivered at a crucial point during a Sanders-Warren face-off, or in the likely event that the left of the party are forced to coalesce around one candidate to take on Biden.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s no great surprise that Sanders has won Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement. After all, she worked on his 2016 presidential campaign. It would have been much smarter to save her endorsement for later, to give Warren or other campaigns a flicker of hope that she could endorse them, before publicly backing Sanders in a \u201csurprise move\u201d \u2014 because this feels like a bit of a non-event.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

With his public health issues and stagnation in the polls, Sanders needs to show people he\u2019s back in the game and ready to fight on. The other is that the Squad suspect Sanders won\u2019t win the nomination, and want to leave some distance between now and the moment they throw their backing behind another Democrat \u2013 probably Liz Warren \u2013 to unite the party ahead of 2020\u2019s showdown with Trump.\n\nWarren\u2019s place in all of this is equally intriguing. Known as the women with \u201ca plan\u201d for everything, she seemingly hasn\u2019t bothered writing a healthcare plan because she\u2019s such a fan of Sanders\u2019. So she will no doubt be disappointed that she could not win the endorsement of these progressive Congresswomen. Still, Ayanna Pressley \u2013 the fourth member of the Squad \u2013 represents a district in Massachusetts, the state Warren represents in the Senate. Perhaps she\u2019ll be able to convince her?\n\nEither way, the early timing of these endorsements might actually boost Warren\u2019s appeal as the \u201ccompromise candidate\u201d between Biden and Sanders. In six months\u2019 time, it\u2019s possible the Squad might be publicly endorsing her to bring Democrats together. Bernie Sanders may well be the collateral damage in a wider strategy which celebrates his achievements before ultimately leaving him behind.\n\nRegardless of what happens in the future, these influential progressives choosing this moment to throw their backing behind Sanders tells us a lot about what\u2019s happening right now. Sanders choosing to play one of his trump cards so early in the game hints that he might not be happy with his position in the race, so he\u2019s chosen to up the ante.", "description": "American socialists were given some good news this week when Bernie Sanders, hot off the heels of a stellar debate performance, received some of the most sought-after endorsements of the primary race.
