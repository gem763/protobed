Intended to reduce unnecessary imaging, the policy may penalize doctors who don\u2019t comply by requiring them to get \u201cprior authorization\u201d before ordering imaging tests in the future \u2014 in other words, to follow another regulation.\n\nPredictably, many doctors want the policy reversed or at least delayed so that they can come up with an alternative. They say that there is little evidence that the regulation will achieve its intended aim. They have concerns about how the computer algorithm will interact with existing electronic medical records. More generally, they complain of burdensome regulations, created largely without physician input, that doctors already must follow. The new policy, they say, is another intrusion on physicians\u2019 decision-making authority \u2014 an authority gained over many years of difficult training.\n\nThese are all valid points, and yet after almost six years of delays \u2014 the law was passed in 2014 \u2014 doctors have not advanced an alternative solution. Meanwhile, billions of dollars continue to be spent every year on unnecessary imaging, creating not just financial waste but also real risks to patients, including excess radiation and false-positive diagnoses. If doctors can\u2019t or won\u2019t fix a problem that is almost universally acknowledged in our profession, should we act outraged or surprised when an outside agency tries to do it for us?\n\nTo be fair, medical specialty societies such as the American Board of Internal Medicine have published lists of imaging tests that are generally not beneficial to patients, including M.R.I.s for most lower back pain and stress tests when there are no signs of heart disease. Using these criteria, doctors on their own have been able to reduce the volume of imaging.", "description": "If doctors won\u2019t help fix the problems of health care, they shouldn\u2019t be outraged when outsiders try to do it for them.", "authors": ["Sandeep Jauhar"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/opinion/11jauhar/11jauhar-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
