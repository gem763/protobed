The conspiracy involved high-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey, the U.S. said.\n\n\u201cHalkbank\u2019s systemic participation in the illicit movement of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Iranian oil revenue was designed and executed by senior bank officials,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in New York said in a statement. \u201cHalkbank will now have to answer for its conduct in an American court.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish lira fell almost 1% after the charges were announced. It\u2019s down 4.5% so far this month, more than any of the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\n\nA Halkbank representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text seeking comment.\n\nThe charges in the years-long case were described by a U.S. official as a frontal assault on Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Because of the timing, there\u2019s a risk the prosecution will be perceived as a political attack by the U.S. on Turkey for its aggression, the official added.\n\nClick here to read the press release and indictment\n\nTwo people, including a senior Halkbank executive, were previously convicted in the case, which led to the airing in a Manhattan courtroom of many of Halkbank\u2019s activities. The late-2017 trial sparked vehement protests from Erdogan, who accused U.S. officials of trying to harm his country\u2019s national and economic interests. He labeled the prosecution nothing short of an \u201cinternational coup attempt.\u201d\n\nThe case became a lasting irritant for the Turkish president, who pressed both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump to intervene and dismiss it. Early in Trump\u2019s term, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hired by the central figure in the case, and he mounted an audacious shadow diplomacy effort to win his client\u2019s freedom. On Giuliani\u2019s behalf, Trump himself asked a member of his cabinet to steer prosecutors away from the case.\n\nSeveral months after the trial of the senior Halkbank executive ended, U.S. officials began negotiating a potential penalty with the bank. But no settlement was announced, and the broader case seemed to go dormant.\n\nRead More: U.S. Inquiry Into Turkey\u2019s Halkbank Inflamed Erdogan, Then Went Quiet\n\nThen Trump announced last week that the U.S. was withdrawing its forces from the border with Syria, and Turkey mounted a military campaign to take over the region. Trump\u2019s decision was roundly criticized by Congress and other foreign leaders, and images from the battlefield inflamed public opinion. Trump then demanded Turkey withdraw its forces, and in a cryptic tweet threatened to \u201cdestroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy.\n\nSecretly Launder\n\nThe case began with U.S. charges against Reza Zarrab, a flamboyant Turkish gold trader who said he\u2019d helped Iran tap funds from overseas oil sales that were frozen in foreign accounts. Zarrab ultimately pleaded guilty and became the star witness against the bank executive, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was himself convicted at the trial in early 2018.\n\nThough the bank wasn\u2019t initially charged, U.S. prosecutors claimed it became the nucleus of a plot to secretly launder funds out of Turkey to Dubai. There, money could be moved into the global financial system and made available to help pay Iran\u2019s bills. Prosecutors showed how Iranian funds were converted to gold, exported to Dubai, sold for cash and then distributed for Iran\u2019s benefit. About $1 billion was converted into U.S. dollars and moved through banks in New York, the U.S. said at the trial.\n\nThe trial gripped Turkey. Some testimony sent its markets into gyrations, in part because prosecutors aired evidence that tied the scheme to Turkish officials and their families. An ex-finance minister was charged in absentia.\n\nZarrab, who\u2019s married to a Turkish pop star, had a tabloid lifestyle of yachts, fast cars and an office in a Trump Tower in Istanbul. After he was detained during a 2016 trip to the U.S., he added Giuliani, who was Trump\u2019s confidante but not yet the president\u2019s lawyer, to his legal team.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. brought a criminal case against one of Turkey\u2019s largest banks for aiding a scheme to evade sanctions against Iran, a move that carries political overtones as tensions build over Turkey\u2019s military incursions in Syria.In an indictment filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors", "authors": ["Greg Farrell", "Christian Berthelsen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
