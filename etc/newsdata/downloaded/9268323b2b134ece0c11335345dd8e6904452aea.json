Creating the cozy fall feeling you\u2019re after could be as easy as striking a match (or getting some pumpkin spice dog treats or pumpkin pie KitKats ... but we digress).\n\nBut where do you go when you\u2019re in search of the perfect spicy candle for fall?\n\nFor thousands of shoppers, the search seemed to end with this pumpkin spice candle on Etsy with a 5-star rating. It has 3,000 reviews that rave about its lovely scent, which apparently can only be compared to baking a pumpkin pie while a fire roars in the background. This cult-favorite candle is handmade by SweetWaterDecor, a Pennsylvania Etsy shop that makes coffee mugs, candles and home accessories.\n\nThis best-selling pumpkin spice-scented candle is made with a blend of natural essential oils like cedarwood, cypress, clove and cinnamon bark to create a warm, spiced scent that will make any space feel like fall. The 9-ounce jar is large enough for 40 to 80 hours of burn time, and retails for $18 with free shipping within the U.S.\n\nDoesn\u2019t get much sweeter than that.", "description": "This pumpkin spice candle has nearly 3,000 reviews.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b5bfb20000093034ebe72.jpeg?cache=T38zsZXoEK&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
