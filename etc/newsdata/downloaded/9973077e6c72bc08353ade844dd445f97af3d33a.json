This means that trans people will be able to input their gender in response to the mandatory sex question.\n\nTrans rights campaigners have lauded the inclusion of new questions on the next census as \u201ca major victory for equality\u201d. However feminist academics have warned against \u201cself-identification\u201d on the national survey claiming that it \u201cdoes not exist to validate people\u2019s identities\u201d.\n\nIt is now awaiting Royal Assent meaning it will become ratified in law. The Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on May 1, 2019, received its first reading in the House of Commons in June 2019 and its Second Reading in July 2019.", "description": "The next census will enable trans people to \u201cchoose their gender\u201d for the first time, after the controversial Bill passed its final stage in the Houses of Parliament.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Joanna Williams", "Tom Harris", "Zoe Strimpel", "Pieter Cleppe"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000002304306-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq9RQhOtmgb8S3sTFwLv2VX-DSV_dXcWbrTlT5gho2zKg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
