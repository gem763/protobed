They\u2019re often available in the fall open enrollment window that many companies provide for benefit changes.\n\nWhether an employee should consider one of these plans can depend on their regular insurance, medical history and financial health. Here\u2019s a closer look.\n\nTHE COVERAGE\n\nPlans that cover serious illnesses, accidents and hospital stays are the most common forms of supplemental coverage.\n\nThey can be purchased separately, but some insurers also are starting to offer plans that include all three, said Brian Russell, a supplemental benefits expert with the consultant Mercer.\n\nAbout two-thirds of medium-size or big companies offered accident coverage this year, according to Mercer. Nearly 60% provided coverage for a serious illness or condition like cancer or a stroke.\n\nThese plans, which also can be found in the individual insurance market, don\u2019t replace health coverage. They generally provide a lump sum payout if someone winds up staying in a hospital, visiting an emergency room or being diagnosed with a serious condition.\n\nThat money often can be used to pay for things like utilities or child care expenses, not just doctor bills.\n\nEmployers have started offering this coverage more as they\u2019ve raised the deductibles on their medical plans. High-deductible plans cost less, so they take a smaller bite out of a worker\u2019s paycheck.\n\nBut those deductibles also can expose patients to thousands of dollars in medical bills before most coverage begins.\n\nWEIGHING OPTIONS\n\nThese policies can cost $50 a month or less depending on how broad the plan is and who is covered. But they deserve careful consideration before making that first payment.\n\nStart with the plan details. Employees should understand what gets covered, and they should take into account their medical history.\n\nA critical illness plan, for instance, may not cover a chronic condition like diabetes. It also may not cover a cancer that has come back or might have a waiting period before it does.\n\nEmployees also should consider their savings account balances and the financial exposure they would have to a big medical bill from their health plan.\n\n\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t have a lot of cash in the bank or they haven\u2019t set up their (health savings) account, this might be enticing to them,\u201d said Susan Rider, an Indianapolis-based benefits consultant.\n\nAccident coverage, which would help with an emergency room bill, may be appealing for a family with young children. A middle-age employee who has built up retirement savings might be interested in critical illness coverage that would protect her from being ruined financially by a cancer diagnosis.\n\nSome employees also may want to avoid paying another insurance bill and instead invest their money in a health savings account, which provides unique tax breaks if the money is used for a medical expense.\n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\nEmployees also should review the rest of their coverage during their company\u2019s open enrollment window. That\u2019s generally the one time each year when people can make changes unless they get a new job or go through a big change like the birth of a child.\n\nAside from health and dental coverage, employees should consider all the benefits their company offers and review life insurance needs and retirement planning, Mercer\u2019s Tracy Watts said.\n\nIt\u2019s also worthwhile to think about any planned medical spending in the coming year for things like dental braces or knee surgery and whether money should be set aside in a flexible spending account.\n\n___\n\nFollow Tom Murphy on Twitter: @thpmurphy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Health insurance costs have climbed so high, there's insurance for it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Murphy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/on_the_money_supplemental_coverage_70668_c0-285-5858-3702_s1200x700.jpg?320932591c8cc1241f5416b432f453b8cdb50a9a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
