Bloomberg estimated that Gates overtook Bezos in early trading Friday, as Amazon shares were down as much as 4 percent, though the stock has recovered some of its losses.\n\nForbes estimated that Bezos actually fell to the No. 2 spot late Thursday, when Amazon shares dipped 7 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nBut his decline wasn\u2019t completely the result of Amazon\u2019s share price, according to Forbes. Bezos recently transferred a quarter of his Amazon stake to his ex-wife, MacKenzie, as part of their highly publicized divorce.\n\nAmazon disappointed Wall Street on Thursday when it reported its first decline in profits in about two years, with net income dropping 26 percent. The news sent Amazon shares plummeting 9 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nIn addition to running Amazon, Bezos\u2019 empire also includes the Washington Post.\n\nOther high-ranking U.S. billionaires on Bloomberg\u2019s list include Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Warren Buffett at No. 4 and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg at No. 5.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
