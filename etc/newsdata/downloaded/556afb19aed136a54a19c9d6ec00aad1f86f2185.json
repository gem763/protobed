(that) could help us in case we don't want to bat again. It could really put pressure on the South Africans.\"\n\nKohli, leading the Test side for the 50th time, reached his half-century with a boundary off fast bowler Vernon Philander.\n\nBut Agarwal took the lead role despite being hit on the helmet from a bouncer by debutant paceman Anrich Nortje. He went on to hit Nortje for three glorious off drives in one over before lunch.\n\nThe right-handed batsman put on 138 runs for the second wicket with Cheteshwar Pujara, who made 58, to steady the innings after the fall of Rohit Sharma early in the day.\n\nHe was eventually caught in the slips by South African captain Faf du Plessis - one of fast bowler Kagiso Rabada's three wickets for the day.\n\n\"There were periods where I was getting boundaries very easily, there were periods where they bowled very good line and lengths and were testing the bouncer as well,\" said Agarwal, who is playing his sixth Test since making his debut last year.\n\nRabada also claimed Sharma, who edged the ball into the gloves of wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock for 14 in the 10th over.\n\nThat was a disappointment for Sharma, who hit twin centuries in his first run as Test opener in Visakhapatnam where India took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\n\nRabada struck again to get Pujara, caught again by du Plessis, just before tea. Pujara, who was dropped by Temba Bavuma before he scored, hit a six and nine fours.\n\nRabada returned figures of 3-48 in 18.1 overs.\n\nVictory for India in the series will see them beat the record of 10 straight home series wins they share with Australia.", "description": "Opening batsman Mayank Agarwal hit his second century in successive matches to hand India the advantage against South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/19fb7207972e41afb0f9eb39ffaa8835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
