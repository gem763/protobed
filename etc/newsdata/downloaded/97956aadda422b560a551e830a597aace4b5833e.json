Poroshenko was still the president of Ukraine earlier this year when his team sought a lifeline. With the polls showing him in clear danger of losing his re-election campaign, some of his associates, eager to hold on to their own jobs and influence, took steps that could have yielded a signal of public support from a vital ally: President Trump.\n\nOver several weeks in March, the office of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor moved ahead on two investigations of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One was focused on an oligarch \u2014 previously cleared of wrongdoing by the same prosecutor \u2014 whose company employed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son. The other dealt with the release by a separate Ukrainian law enforcement agency to the media of information that hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nThe actions by the prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, did not come out of thin air. They were the first visible results of a remarkable behind-the-scenes campaign to gather and disseminate political dirt from a foreign country, encouraged by Mr. Trump and carried out by his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. In the last week their engagement with Ukraine has prompted a formal impeachment inquiry into whether the president courted foreign interference to hurt a leading political rival.\n\nThe story of how Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani operated in Ukraine has emerged gradually in recent months. It was laid out in further detail in the past week in a reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call this summer with a new Ukrainian president and in a complaint filed by a whistle-blower inside the United States government.", "description": "Details of the push by President Trump and Rudolph Giuliani for Ukraine to investigate Democrats show a sustained effort that encompassed elections in both countries.", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
