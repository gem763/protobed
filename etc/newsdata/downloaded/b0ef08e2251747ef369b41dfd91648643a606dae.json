A focus on outcomes, not a focus on activity.\"\n\nSee also: Australia's open data approach lands in a security and privacy minefield (TechRepublic)\n\nLinking data to improve out of home care\n\nUsing de-identified datasets linked across Health, Education, Justice, Family and Community Services, Transport, and Department of Industry, the NSW Data Analytics Centre has been able to assist the state government with making data-driven reforms to its Out of Home Care (OOHC) program, which is designed to help young people in risk of harm.\n\n\"Data is a record of what's happened in the past. The outcomes we are looking at are a way of describing what we're trying to achieve and understand those factors of risk, which leads to either the outcome we're trying to achieve or adverse versions of those things,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Oppermann, once completed, the reforms would become the basis for helping the federal government to build similar datasets which could be modified for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, as part of an agreement that was signed between the NSW Data Analytics Centre and the federal government in September.\n\n\"Initially this project will see NSW, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia linking with the Commonwealth \u2026 linking data from NGOs, linking data sets from providers -- all de-identified, all using the gold standard of de-identification, which in NSW is the Centre for Health linkage, with the Commonwealth it's the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare,\" he said.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The standards would clarify how to best measure the amount of personal information that is linked to de-identified data sets, NSW chief data scientist says.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/23/7a1cf24f-643c-40be-a8eb-f74fe89cd600/thumbnail/770x578/83df19fa1501c6edb52f604f0756981f/istock-1025745040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
