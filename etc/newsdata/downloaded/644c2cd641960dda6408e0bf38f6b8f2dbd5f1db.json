She traveled from around 350 to 400 yards on the wrong side of the road. It was a head-on collision. We later lost him in hospital,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how we can start to grieve for him,\u201d she added of her family\u2019s plea for closure. \u201cWe have nothing. No justice. We have nothing to put our minds at rest that she\u2019s even remorseful.\u201d\n\nSacoolas spoke with authorities at the scene and said she had no plans to leave the country in the near future, the Northamptonshire Police Department said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIf we can\u2019t resolve it then, of course, I will be raising it myself personally with the White House.\n\n\u201cDue process was also followed in seeking the necessary documentation to allow for the arrest and formal interview of the suspect,\u201d the police department said.\n\nTo authorities\u2019 apparent surprise, Sacoolas later left for the U.S. and has since claimed diplomatic immunity under the 1961 Vienna Convention, which protects diplomats and their family members from prosecution. Immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, in a statement to HuffPost, expressed sympathy for the deceased\u2019s family but said that it\u2019s highly unlikely the U.S. will waive diplomatic immunity. The case will receive intense attention at senior levels, the spokesperson said, and the department will consider its global impact, as it does with all cases like this.\n\nThe State Department did not identify Sacoolas by name, and declined to comment on her spouse\u2019s diplomatic role.\n\nNorthamptonshire Chief constable Nick Adderley said that he and his county\u2019s police, fire and crime commissioner have also requested that her immunity be waived.\n\n\u201cHarry Dunn\u2019s family deserve justice and in order to achieve this, a full and thorough investigation, with the assistance of all parties involved, needs to take place,\u201d the Northamptonshire Police Department said. \u201cNorthamptonshire Police is committed to ensuring justice for Harry and specially trained officers continue to support the Dunn family in their loss, including keeping them fully informed of all developments in the investigation.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson said Anne Sacoolas\u2019 claim of diplomatic immunity is unjustified and he will personally take action if she doesn't return.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b49642100009004ab8efe.jpeg?cache=7l4w719rj7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
