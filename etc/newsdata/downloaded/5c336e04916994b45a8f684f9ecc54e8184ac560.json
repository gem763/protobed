She was released two days early, but that is typical. If an inmates\u2019s release date falls on a weekend or a legal holiday, the Bureau of Prisons sometimes opts to release them the last preceding weekday.\n\nFelicity Huffman, going to court in May, has completed her prison sentence.

In September, Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison, plus a $30,000 fine, one year of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.\n\nFelicity Huffman \u2014 federal prison inmate 77806-112 \u2014 was expected to be released on Oct. 27.

Macy and their two daughters \u2014 prosecutors told the court that Huffman had paid the $30,000 fine \u201cin full.\u201d\n\nIn a statement after her sentencing, Huffman said she accepted the punishment \u201cwithout reservation,\u201d adding, \u201cmy goal now is to serve the sentence that the court has given me.\u201d She also said she hoped that her family, friends and community would \u201cforgive me for my actions.\u201d\n\nFelicity Huffman's official statement after being sentenced to 14 days in prison for the college admissions scheme. @YahooEnt pic.twitter.com/IyXFR3opAV \u2014 Suzy Byrne (@SuzyByrne) September 13, 2019\n\nHuffman\u2019s daughter Sophia \u2014 who was unaware her mom paid to change her test score, prosecutors said \u2014 is taking a gap year after graduating high school last spring amid the scandal. Macy said in a letter to Judge Indira Talwani that the now 19-year-old\u2019s unnamed dream college rescinded its invitation to audition for its theater program, after she had traveled to the school, in the wake of Huffman\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe couple\u2019s younger daughter, Georgia, 17, will graduate from high school next spring. Prosecutors said Huffman considered running the same scheme to improve her SAT test scores as well but later changed her mind.\n\nHuffman was among the first and the most well-known person to be sentenced in the scandal, dubbed Operation Varsity Blues by federal prosecutors. More than 50 people \u2014 parents, coaches, test proctors and admissions counselors \u2014 have faced charges for the scheme which involved test scores being changed and bribes paid to guarantee college admission to children of the wealthy.\n\nLori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were also arrested, for allegedly paying $500,000 to get their daughters, Bella Giannulli and Olivia Jade, into the University of Southern California. They pleaded not guilty and are expected to go to trial, accumulating two additional charges along the way.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
