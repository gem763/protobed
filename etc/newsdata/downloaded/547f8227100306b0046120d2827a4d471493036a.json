I\u2019m a very happy captain.\u201d\n\nAmerican McEnroe looked crestfallen in defeat but congratulated his old adversary Borg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting very sick and tired of you,\u201d the American great told Team Europe after suffering his third successive defeat by Borg\u2019s men. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be the captain of this team, they fought their hearts out. World, you guys are awesome.\u201d\n\nFederer, who won his two singles matches over the weekend including a classic against Kyrgios, said it had been a dream to win the title on home soil.\n\n\u201cFor us, so many emotions. It\u2019s been an unbelievable rollercoaster,\u201d he said, \u201cBjorn, you\u2019re a great captain, and Rocket (Rod Laver), thanks for being here today.\n\n\u201cIt makes it more special. It\u2019s been a dream weekend for me to be playing in Switzerland. Thank you for all the noise you\u2019ve made, I\u2019ve loved every moment,\u201d he added before joining his team to be presented with the trophy by Australian great Laver as blue ticker-tape rained down on the court.\n\nThe event, sanctioned by the men\u2019s ATP tour for the first time this year, will be staged in Boston in 2020.", "description": "Alexander Zverev snatched the Laver Cup for Team Europe as he beat Canada's Milos Raonic in the final rubber of a thrilling three days of action in Geneva's Palexpo Arena on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432864376&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0EV-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
