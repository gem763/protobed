Participating enterprises signed project cooperation agreements worth more than $64 billion, said Wu.\n\nThe BRI is fully aligned with the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and will help accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) worldwide, said Wu.\n\nHe asked for efforts to forge global consensus and make development a priority. The international community should speed up the implementation of the SDGs and place development issues at the heart of the global macro policy framework. Countries should, in light of their national conditions and stage of development, integrate the 2030 Agenda into their medium- and long-term development strategies, said Wu.\n\nPoverty is the greatest challenge to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. As such, poverty reduction should be treated as a top priority, he said. \"Meanwhile, we should focus on infrastructure, education, health care, and other areas closely related to people's livelihood in order to continue to improve their well-being.\"\n\nWu asked for win-win cooperation and stronger global partnerships for development. \"The international community should build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. We should safeguard the international cooperation architecture with North-South cooperation as the main channel supplemented by South-South cooperation.\"\n\nDeveloped countries should honor their official development assistance commitments, increase input, and help developing countries improve their development capabilities and levels according to their needs. Developing countries should forge greater solidarity, seek greater strength through unity, and deepen South-South cooperation. The UN development system should support member states in better implementing the 2030 Agenda, said Wu.\n\nHe called for the advancement of global economic governance and the creation of an enabling international environment for development.\n\nThe international community should firmly uphold multilateralism and multilateral trading system, oppose all forms of protectionism and unilateralism, actively build an open world economy and help developing countries better integrate into the world industrial and supply chain, he said.\n\nThe concerns of developing countries should be heeded, and their representation and voice should be strengthened in the global economic governance, said Wu.", "description": "A Chinese envoy on Monday called for the joint advancement of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for sustainable development.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9bea93a310cf3e97a00375.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
