Therefore, BTC is likely to resume its decline below $8,000 and $7,900 in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, there was a downside extension in bitcoin below the $8,000 support area against the US Dollar. BTC price traded to a new monthly low at $7,915 and settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average. Recently, there was an upside correction above the $8,000 level. Moreover, the price recovered above the $8,020 level, plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,386 high to $7,915 low.\n\nHowever, the upward move was capped by the $8,100 and $8,120 resistance levels. Besides, the price failed to test the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,386 high to $7,915 low. As a result, there was a fresh decline below $8,020. The price is now accelerating declines below the $8,000 level. It even broke the last swing low at $7,915 and traded to a new monthly low near $7,850.\n\nIt seems like there was a strong bearish reaction below $8,000. The next key support is near the $7,800 level. If there are more downsides, bitcoin price could accelerate losses towards the $7,600 and $7,500 levels in the near term. An intermediate support is near the $7,720 level.\n\nOn the upside, the $8,000 and $8,020 levels are likely to act as hurdles for the bulls. The main resistance is near the $8,120 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,240 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is clearly under a lot of pressure below $8,120 and $8,000. As long as there is no close above $8,120 and $8,240, there are chances of more downsides. The main target for the bearish in the coming sessions could be near the $7,600 and $7,500 levels.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is declining sharply and is well below the 40 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $7,800 followed by $7,500.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,020, $8,120 and $8,150.", "description": "Bitcoin price is struggling to rebound above $8,100 against the US Dollar.
