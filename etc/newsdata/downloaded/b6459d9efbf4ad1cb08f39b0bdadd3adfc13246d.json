Or rather, a bright orange one: Taco Bell in the UK has introduced its Doritos Locos Taco, a taco with a shell made entirely of one big Dorito.\n\nTempted? Disgusted? Whatever your reaction, the Tex-Mex chain\u2019s creation \u2013 which originally launched in the US in 2012 \u2013 has a track record of doing rather well. Media outlets hailed the hybrid creation as \u201cone of the most successful fast food innovations of all time\u201d, selling a billion units in the first year.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that more of these snack-food-fast-foods are popping up, especially in the US.\n\nLast month, Pizza Hut rolled out a calzone shaped like a Cheez-It, a square cracker dusted in cheddary crumbs, and, in August, KFC released a fried-chicken sandwich stuffed with Cheetos, puffy cheese-flavoured crisps.\n\nMany of these items only pop up for a limited time, but they always make a high-in-saturated-fats splash, especially on social media.
