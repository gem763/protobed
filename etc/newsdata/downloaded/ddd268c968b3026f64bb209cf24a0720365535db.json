He has surrounded himself with a small, privileged cabal of advisors in Downing Street who are focused on clinging to power at all costs.\n\n\u201cThey have an extreme and ideological vision for our country which would see lower taxes for the rich, lower wages for the poor and lower standards of environmental protection for all.\n\n\u201cJohnson and the hard-right elite that has taken over the Conservative Party are trying to force a Brexit on us that will leave people and the country poorer.\n\n\u201cIt is little wonder that the will of the people is changing. Confronted with the reality of Boris Johnson's destructive Brexit, more voters than ever before now say that the only way to solve this mess is to put the question back to the people.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll be marching in London on 19 October. To stand up against a reckless, extreme Brexit, to show that the will of the people is on the move and demand that our voices are heard.\u201d", "description": "Campaigners for a second EU referendum are turning Leavers\u2019 own slogan against them by telling Boris Johnson that the Brexit he wants to deliver is not \u201cthe will of the people\u201d.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/01/13/brexit-signs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
