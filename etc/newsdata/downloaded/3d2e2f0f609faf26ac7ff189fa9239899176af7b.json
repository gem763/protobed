In this film, John Rambo, who fought Soviets in the 1980s, travels to Mexico to take on a drug cartel. It was released by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and Millennium Media.\n\nThe \u201cDownton\u201d opening is the best-ever for Focus Features, the specialty division of Comcast Corp. \u2019s Universal Pictures known for critically acclaimed releases such as 2005\u2019s \u201cBrokeback Mountain.\u201d\n\nAbout three-quarters of the opening-weekend audience were women and 60% were over the age of 35.\n\n\u201cDownton\u201d became a popular export almost immediately after premiering in the U.S. in early 2011. Members of the television cast resume their roles in the movie, which ratchets up the stakes and revolves around a pending visit from King George V and Queen Mary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you have your best friend from high school, and you haven\u2019t seen them in five years, but then you get back together and it\u2019s like no time has passed at all,\u201d said Lisa Bunnell, Focus\u2019s president of distribution.\n\nBringing a popular television series to the big screen doesn\u2019t always mean automatic success. Several attempts in the past several years\u2014including \u201cBaywatch,\u201d \u201cChips\u201d and \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d\u2014have fallen flat.\n\nFocus had a challenge on its hands: Convincing moviegoers that a trip to the theater was necessary for a story they were accustomed to watching at home. The studio treated the release like a much-anticipated superhero movie opening, encouraging audiences to dress up in flapper dresses and hosting tea parties at certain locations.\n\nOpening-weekend audiences gave \u201cDownton\u201d an \u201cA\u201d grade, according to the CinemaScore market-research firm. \u201cRambo\u201d received a \u201cB\u201d and \u201cAd Astra\u201d got a \u201cB-.\u201d\n\nWrite to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com", "description": "\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d collected a robust $31 million in the U.S. and Canada, according to preliminary estimates, a healthy start that bucks the trend of recent TV-to-film failures.", "authors": ["Erich Schwartzel", "Erich.Schwartzel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109674/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
