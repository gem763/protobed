It now includes most U.S. states as well as the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nFacebook shares were down more than 2% at $184.73 on Tuesday. The company had no immediate comment.\n\nThe statement provided a list of states involved in the probe and added that other states \"cannot confirm their participation in pending investigations.\" California, the largest state, was not on the list.\n\nSome states, particularly New York and Nebraska, have raised concerns that Facebook and other big tech companies engage in anti-competitive practices, expose consumer data to potential data theft and push up advertising prices.\n\nFacebook also faces probes by the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Facebook investigations are part of a larger landscape of probes of big tech firms.\n\nReuters and others reported in June that the Justice Department and FTC had divided responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking on Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) while the FTC looked into Facebook and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms, which would include Facebook.", "description": "Facebook probe by U.S. states expands to 47 attorneys general", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L1ES-OCATC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
