Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer. Bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK. Most people diagnosed with it are over the age of 60. The main symptoms of bowel cancer are: Blood in your stool or rectal bleeding\n\nStomach cramps\n\nPersistant gas\n\nNever feeling like you have emptied your bowels\n\nExhaustion\n\nWeight loss\n\nChange in bowel habits that persists for more than a month If you have one or more of the symptoms and they persist for more than four weeks, see your GP. It's not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. Age \u2013 almost 9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over. Diet \u2013 a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk. Weight \u2013 bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese. Exercise \u2013 being inactive increases your risk of getting bowel cancer. Alcohol - drinking to excess.\n\nThe researchers believe this is due to the introduction of colorectal cancer screening programmes, leading to earlier detection and an increased chance of survival.\n\nFigures show 52,331 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2017 and 209,237 in the US. That's compared to 32,729 and 152,002, respectively, in 1990.\n\nBut despite their being nearly 10,000 extra diagnoses in the UK, the number of deaths remained at 20,000 a year.\n\nIn America, the number of deaths rose slightly from 69,000 to 79,000 despite there being an additional 50,000 sufferers since 1990.\n\nSimilarly, in countries where screening programmes were established two or three decades ago, reductions in death rates were observed.\n\nThe study indicated that the risk factors for bowel cancer are different in males and females.\n\nAlcohol use, smoking and diets low in calcium, milk and fibre had a considerable burden on males.\n\nFor females, dietary risks, but not alcohol use or smoking, were found to be the most attributable risks.\n\nProfessor Herbert Tilg, chair of the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Scientific Committee, said: 'This analysis provides the most comprehensive picture of the global burden of digestive disease to date.\n\n'Examining these cross-populational trends offers vital information on the changing burden of disease and aids the correct allocation of resources to improve patient outcomes.'\n\nProfessor Reza Malekzadeh, lead author of the study, said: 'Pancreatic cancer is one of the world's deadliest cancers, with an overall five-year survival rate of just five per cent in high, middle and low-income countries.\n\n'Major risk factors for the disease, such as smoking, diabetes and obesity, are largely modifiable and present a huge opportunity for prevention.'\n\nThe findings are to be presented at UEG Week 2019 in Barcelona later this week.", "description": "There were 1.8million new cases of bowel cancer in 2017, up by 9.5 per cent over the last 27 years.
