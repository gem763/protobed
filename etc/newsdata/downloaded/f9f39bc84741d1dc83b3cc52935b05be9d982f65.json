Martinez did not rule out his Game 6 starter, Stephen Strasburg, who indicated last night he felt gassed.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Nats uniform on today and you\u2019re part of 25, I\u2019m going to ask you if you can go,\u201d said Martinez, who added, \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to [Strasburg] later on. Hey, there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMartinez added catcher Kurt Suzuki, scratched from the starting lineup, could still appear. He talked to the catcher early Wednesday morning and \u201cfelt it would be best to just keep him on the bench.\u201d The lineup shake-up was precautionary.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI like Suzuki coming off the bench if need be, to pinch-hit or even to catch,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nEveryone else is apparently good to go. It\u2019s Game 7 and, in the words of Max Scherzer, let\u2019s go.\n\n\u2022 The commissioner discussed the Trea Turner call, the bat-carrying controversy and more.\n\n\u2022 Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki was supposed to be back in the starting lineup after missing the last two games with a right hip flexor strain. The 36-year-old hurt himself in Game 4 while blocking a Fernando Rodney change-up in the dirt. He was available in an emergency pinch-hit situation in Game 6, but the team never needed him and elected to let him rest up for a Game 7 start. Instead, Suzuki will not start Game 7 and Yan Gomes will catch for Max Scherzer.\n\nAD\n\nLineup change for the Nationals: Kurt Suzuki has been scratched and Yan Gomes will catch Max Scherzer and hit eighth tonight. \u2014 Jesse Dougherty (@dougherty_jesse) October 30, 2019\n\nDave Martinez on Kurt Suzuki: He thought I\u2019d be safer to bring Suzuki off the bench and not risk having to pull him a few innings into the game. \u2014 Jesse Dougherty (@dougherty_jesse) October 30, 2019\n\nSuzuki and Scherzer formed one of the Nationals\u2019 best batteries this season. His numbers with Scherzer this season: 2.08 ERA in 99 \u2154 innings pitched. Scherzer\u2019s performance when paired with Gomes, however, has been less productive: 4.09 ERA in 72 \u2154 innings.\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 The Wizards \u2014 led by Juan Soto mega-fan Bradley Beal \u2014 continue to show love to the local baseball team. In an odd twist, Houston\u2019s NBA team is in Washington for a game at the same time that Washington\u2019s MLB team is in Houston for Game 7.\n\nthere's so much happening in this video\n\n\n\n- rookie hazing\n\n- support for the #Nats\n\n- Halloween outfit because why not? https://t.co/KEuaBOprgj \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 30, 2019\n\nHow to watch\n\nGame 7: Washington Nationals at Houston Astros (Series tied, 3-3)\n\nWhen: 8:07 p.m.\n\nWhere: Minute Maid Park in Houston\n\nStarting pitchers: Max Scherzer (11-7, 2.92 ERA) vs. Zack Greinke (18-5, 2.93 ERA)\n\nAD\n\nMax Scherzer, too hurt to dress himself three days ago, will now start Game 7 of the World Series. The Washington Nationals ace almost appeared as a reliever in Game 6 and, after the game, he rocked slowly, slightly back and forth in front of his locker. He delivered short, curt answers, the frenetic energy inside trying to escape.\n\nAD\n\nHow long can you go? \u201cI should be good.\u201d\n\nIs this a normal start? \u201cGame 7. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nRight fielder Adam Eaton joked that Scherzer was \u201ccoming back from the dead\u201d to start Game 7, because spasms in his neck and back forced the 35-year-old to miss his scheduled Game 5 start. Now, after a cortisone shot, he\u2019s ready to oppose the Houston Astros third ace Zack Greinke.\n\nAD\n\nScherzer will lead the Nationals as close to a World Series title as this team has ever come. Their World Series hopes soared when they left Houston up 2-0, sagged when they left Washington down 3-2 and now seem strong again after a Game 6 win in which the offense awoke and Stephen Strasburg shoved. This is the first series in MLB, NBA and NHL history to see the road team win the first six games of the series \u2014 the Nationals wouldn\u2019t mind if they extended that streak one more.\n\nAD\n\nLineups\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick DH\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nMax Scherzer P\n\nAD\n\nHouston Astros\n\nGeorge Springer CF\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve 2B\n\nMichael Brantley LF\n\nAlex Bregman 3B\n\nYuli Gurriel 1B\n\nYordan Alvarez DH\n\nCarlos Corea SS\n\nRobinson Chirinos C\n\nJosh Reddick RF\n\nZack Greinke P\n\nGame 7 reading\n\nWhen it comes to pitching strategy, Game 7 of the World Series brings chaos theory to life.

Booming home runs to turn it around. And now, one game to decide it all. (Read more)\n\nJuan Soto copies Alex Bregman\u2019s bat carry after Game 6 home run.
