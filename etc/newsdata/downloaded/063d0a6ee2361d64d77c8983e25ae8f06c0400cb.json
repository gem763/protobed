Diamonds will be converted into gameboard plays.\n\nGo to www.BusinessInsider.co.za for more stories.\n\nDiscovery has revealed how its new rewards system currency, called Discovery Miles, will work in 2020.\n\nIt comes with some massive changes to the way clients will be able to earn rewards points for its Vitality members \u2013 including ditching Vitality Rewards points. With over 500,000 Vitality members, Vitality Active Rewards is central to their success. But, the cost of Discovery Vitality will increase by 8% from 2019.\n\nIt will cost more than last year, but rewards will be easier to earn and there will be more partners to spend them on:\n\nKey to making the most out of Vitality is the integration of a Discovery Bank credit card with your Discovery Vitality membership.\n\nWhile new Discovery Bank clients can earn up to 1 Discovery Mile for every R15 spent shopping in-store or online, confirmed Dinesh Govender, CEO of Discovery Vitality, the real benefit comes from a boost in earning miles back from partner stores. You can earn up to 75% back in Discovery Miles when you shop at Pick n Pay and Woolworths and up to 50% back in Discovery Miles at Clicks, Dis-Chem, Sportsmans Warehouse and Totalsports.\n\nCurrently 1,000 Discovery Miles equals about R100 when converting purchases on online stores.\n\nDiscovery Bank credit card holders can earn up to 20% back in Discovery Miles when you fill up at BP and selected Shell service stations or catch a ride with Uber.\n\nThis is in contrast to Vitality members who, without a Discovery Bank credit card, will get only up to 25% back paid in cash into their nominated bank account.\n\nClients have the option of converting the Discovery Miles to cash, and depending on your reward status you could get a better conversion rate. You\u2019ll also be able to exchange Miles for cash or use them to pay anyone else who has a Discovery account.\n\nA future partnership could also be on the cards with Apple Wallets. Discovery hinted that they want to be able to integrate with instant Apple Wallet payments as a method of using the miles, but for now they are using their old QR code generation system.\n\nRead Also: Discovery Bank will soon have some of the basic functions it was missing at launch \u2013 plus extras like converting Discovery Miles to cash\n\nDiscovery Miles will replace Vitality reward points - you\u2019ll still earn Vitality Rewards and get bonuses for achieving all your weekly goals to play on the gameboard.\n\nVitality members can still earn weekly Vitality Active Rewards \u2013 for doing regular exercise, driving well and banking responsibly (a new addition for Discovery Bank members). However instead of earning Vitality points, you\u2019ll now get Discovery Miles. Each time you complete a goal, you get 100 Discovery Miles and a chance to play on the game board for additional Miles.\n\nAccording to Govender, each spin will still meet the minimum amount to purchase a free smoothie. As a bonus, if you achieve all three of these goals in a week they\u2019ll give you a bonus spin on the board.\n\nRead also: 60% of Discovery Vitality members are overweight - and they will now get personalised weight-loss plans and fitness goals\n\nYou can spend the currency on new rewards partners \u2013 like Netflix, Box Office, Exclusive Books, iStore and NetFlix.\n\nA huge change is that Discovery Miles WON\u2019T expire- at least for 5 years. Previous rewards would frustratingly expire after 12 weeks from when they appeared on the board. This means you can stock up for a serious big purchase, instead of a weekly free smoothie.\n\nOn the Vitality Active Rewards platform you\u2019ll still be able to purchase vouchers for Kauai smoothies and your free Woolies wrap. In addition, new partners mean your Miles can be exchanged for DSTV Box Office movies, Netflix subscription vouchers, online gaming store vouchers at Steam, Cotton On and Yuppie Chef vouchers.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be able to use your Discovery Miles for online and in-store shopping at Dis-Chem, Loot.co.za, Hirsch\u2019s, One Day Only, Sportsmans Warehouse and Zando.\n\nLike before, Discovery Miles can be used to pay for flights and accommodation \u2013 we note British Airways, Emirates, Kulula and Quantas remain partners. But with earning more miles more easily, they'll take out a significant chunk of your airfare, post discounts. Additional perks come in the form of being able to convert your miles toward flight partner programmes such as British Airways Executive Club and SAA Voyager.\n\nNote: Discovery say owing to high demand, different rewards may be available at different times, so don't be surprised when the vouchers disappear.\n\nWhat happens to my old Vitality points and Diamonds?\n\nDiscovery says if you have any Vitality reward points left over on 1 January 2020, they\u2019ll replace them at an exchange rate of 1 Vitality reward point to 6 Discovery Miles, no matter when their expiry date is.\n\nDiamonds, which can be won on the gameboard, will soon come to an end as well. They\u2019ll replace each expiring diamond with an extra play on your gameboard.\n\nVitality Health Members could earn 10,000 Miles for achieving personal health goals.\n\nIt's possible to earn over 10,000 Discovery Miles a year for achieving personalised health goals.\n\nMore on Health Rewards: Discovery Vitality wants you to meditate every day, and sleep more.
