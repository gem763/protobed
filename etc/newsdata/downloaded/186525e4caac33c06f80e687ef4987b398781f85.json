Ask anyone who\u2019s ever crowdfunded to pay a medical bill or donated to someone else\u2019s effort, paid an exorbitant fee for a prescription medication, or waited months to see a medical practitioner who actually accepts their insurance. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not surprising to hear that not only are Americans paying twice as much for healthcare as we were in the 80s, a solid chunk (25 percent!) of the money spent on healthcare can be classified as \u201cwasteful.\u201d Per the New York Times, the $760 billion wasted annually on healthcare exceeds annual military spending, which is pretty mind-blowing considering how much the U.S. government loves throwing money at The Troops (until they need healthcare or social services, of course).\n\nAccording to an overview published by data analysts at Clever in September, the average American pays 101 percent more for healthcare than they would have in 1984, and the number of people choosing to forgo insurance is also climbing, with a 7 percent increase in the last year.\n\nAnd what are people getting when they shell out more money to the American healthcare system? According to an analysis of wasteful healthcare spending published by the JAMA on Monday: \u201cAdministrative inefficiency,\u201d like billing and coding waste and physician time lost to insurance coordination, to the tune of $265 billion; \u201cpricing failures,\u201d like spikes in the cost of medications, doctor\u2019s visits, and emergency services, that max out at around $240 billion; plus overtreatment, failures in care coordination and delivery, plus Medicare fraud.\n\nThe JAMA report proposed a number of fixes for wasteful healthcare spending for each of the categories listed above, but even those would only tackle an estimated 25 percent of that $760 billion lowball, meaning that only 5 percent of the total healthcare spending in the U.S. would be affected. It seems worth noting that researchers in countries with socialized healthcare systems don\u2019t seem to have to publish extensive overviews of how exactly their systems and citizens are hemorrhaging money in order to keep people alive, let alone healthy. At minimum, it seems like we could curb the ability of pharmaceutical companies to set prices so high that people die from treatable illnesses all the time.\n\nIn an editorial on the JAMA analysis, Donald Berwick, who briefly oversaw Medicare and Medicaid under the Obama administration, pointed to American politics as the most likely culprit for healthcare waste. \u201cWhat [researchers] call \u2018waste,\u2019 others call \u2018income,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeople and organizations (for-profit and not-for-profit) making big incomes under current delivery models include very powerful corporations and guilds in a nation that tolerates strong influences on elections by big donors.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s the argument U.S. officials and pharmaceutical companies love to make: Money is necessary for drug research and development, which is why we can\u2019t regulate drug prices. But when individual citizens of literally every other country in the world spend less money on prescriptions than Americans do, it feels safe to say there\u2019s room for regulation.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "One cool trick could eliminate record-smashing medical expenditures lost to administrative inefficiency, price hikes, and overtreatment: Nationalize coverage!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e11f3c94537000a155b39/lede/1570640373068-A-genderqueer-person-sitting-in-a-hospital-gown-sitting-in-an-exam-room.jpeg?crop=Infinityxw:Infinityxh;NaNxw,NaNxh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
