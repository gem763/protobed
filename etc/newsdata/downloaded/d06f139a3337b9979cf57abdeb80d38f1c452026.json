(AP) \u2014 A Maryland board has approved paying about $9 million to compensate five men who were wrongly imprisoned for a combined 120 years.\n\nThe Maryland Board of Public Works voted Wednesday for the compensation.\n\nThe men will be paid $78,916 for each year they were incarcerated. That amounts to the state\u2019s median household income.\n\nMaryland judges and prosecutors have found that petitioners Jerome Johnson, Lamar Johnson, Walter Lomax, Clarence Shipley and Hubert James Williams are innocent. Some petitions filed by attorneys have been pending for over a year.\n\nTreasurer Nancy Kopp, who is one of the three board members, described the payments as \u201ca very small token and heartfelt apologies of the state and all of our citizens.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Maryland board has approved paying about $9 million to compensate five men who were wrongly imprisoned for a combined 120 years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Witte"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/06/10/shutterstock_184689539_c0-65-1000-648_s1200x700.jpg?34cf85f85a3697b3abfa26e6cedf66ed1bda6bc5", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
