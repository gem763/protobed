Jean says she has made these payments since 2017. She also requests an additional $321,654 in back child support that she believes she is owed from the TV personality, TMZ reported, citing court documents.\n\nThe former football player and Jean married in 1999 while the current \u201cGood Morning America\u201d co-host was six years into a 15-year career with the New York Giants.
