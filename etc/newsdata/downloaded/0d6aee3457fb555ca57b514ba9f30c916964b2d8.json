The redesign featured silhouettes of a Su-57 and a flying-wing aircraft that looked a lot like the Okhotnik.\n\nRussia claims that the Okhotnik has stealth capabilities, a byproduct of its shape and an anti-radar coating, and is equipped with electro-optical, radar, and other types of reconnaissance equipment.\n\nThe heavy attack drone is currently controlled remotely, but in future tests, it is expected to perform in a semi-autonomous state and eventually a completely autonomous mode, TASS reports.\n\nTesting with various armaments is expected in the next few years, and the drone will be handed over to Russian troops around 2025.", "description": "The flight appears to confirm long-held suspicions about the drone's purpose.
