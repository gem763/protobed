The dogs go on to transform veterans\u2019 lives.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe call him \u2018Kevin the wonder dog,\u2019 \u201d Moore\u2019s wife, Dawn, said Thursday, pointing to the Labrador retriever whose light brown eyes were fixed, as usual, on her husband. \u201cHe\u2019s always wondering, \u2018What can I do for you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nKevin, a 3-year-old service dog with a golden fur coat, wakes Moore up when he has nightmares, keeps him steady when he gets dizzy on stairs and turns on lights when he enters rooms. He makes Moore feel comfortable in public spaces such as grocery stores and doctors\u2019 offices, where he once couldn\u2019t go without Dawn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt not just saved my life, but my family\u2019s as well,\u201d Moore told a room full of prisoners and staff at the maximum-security prison in this small town, moments before Kevin was reunited with the inmate who trained him.\n\nKevin is one of 23 service dogs trained at the Western Correctional Institution through a program run by America\u2019s VetDogs, a nonprofit that pairs service dogs with veterans who are struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder. Sully, former president George H.W. Bush\u2019s service dog who became a viral sensation at his funeral, was trained through the same program at a prison in Hagerstown, Md.\n\nOn Thursday, Moore, who has endured 19 surgeries over the past 27 years, directly addressed the inmates: \u201cYou guys are my heroes,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHeroes come from every walk of life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSitting in the audience in the prison library, Herbert Wilson-Bey grinned. Kevin was the third service dog Wilson-Bey had trained, raising Kevin from the time he was a 6-week-old puppy until he was more than a year old and was mature enough to be paired with a veteran.\n\nWilson-Bey, 44, grew up in Baltimore and has spent his entire adult life in prison after being convicted of robbery and murder at age 17. Training the dogs, he said, has been one of his first real responsibilities. He has never held a job, and he could not help raise his son, who was 3 months old when Wilson-Bey went to prison.\n\nAD\n\nThe animals stay with inmates 24 hours a day Monday through Friday, then they spend weekends with volunteers so they are acclimated to life outside the prison.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou are always working, but it is joyous work,\u201d said Wilson-Bey, who joined the program in 2013 because he wanted to give back. \u201cIt\u2019s like, if I put all my heart into this puppy, they are going to come out and be able to help someone.\u201d\n\nHe initially thought bonding with the puppies was just about teaching them commands. Later, he understood the importance of showing them love.\n\n\u201cPut the puppy on your chest and let it feel your heart,\u201d said Wilson-Bey, who wears a necklace with a dog-paw emblem around his neck. \u201cLet it lick your face, even if you might not like that.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s appreciation ceremony was the first time Moore and another veteran met the inmates who trained their respective dogs, and the first time the inmates had seen their former trainees since they graduated.\n\nIt was meant as a celebration of the collaboration between America\u2019s VetDogs and the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Recruitment, which began in 2012 and which is part of the system\u2019s effort to focus on restorative justice.\n\nOf the six states with such prison training programs, Maryland boasts the biggest number of successfully trained dogs, said America\u2019s VetDogs spokeswoman Sheila O\u2019Brien.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat could be more restorative than changing someone\u2019s life for the better?\u201d said Robert L. Green, who runs the state\u2019s correctional department. \u201cIt\u2019s all about healing.\u201d\n\nWhen Moore and his wife, who live in Fredericksburg, Va., drove up to the high-security prison, surrounded by rolling hills and changing leaves near the border of Maryland and West Virginia, they noticed that Kevin\u2019s nose had shot into the air and that his tail was wagging.\n\nMoore could tell the dog knew exactly where he was.\n\nWhen Kevin saw Wilson-Bey, his whole body started shaking as he wagged even harder. Wilson-Bey crouched down as the dog nuzzled him.\n\n\u201cIt was therapeutic for me, too,\u201d Wilson-Bey told Moore, 59, as they talked after the ceremony about his training.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cKevin pulled me out of an abyss that I didn\u2019t know how to get out of,\u201d Moore said. He started weaning himself off medications, which often made him feel forgetful and disconnected from his family, three months after being paired with Kevin in April. Six weeks ago, he stopped taking the last one.\n\nAD\n\nAmerica\u2019s VetDogs is one of dozens of private organizations that train \u201cpsychiatric service\u201d dogs that aim to help address the military\u2019s mental health crisis. Proponents of such programs say that they help struggling veterans function better in society. But program officials have also faced questions about the effectiveness of their efforts, and who should pay for them.\n\nIt takes more than $50,000 to breed, raise, train, match and support a service dog trained through America\u2019s VetDogs. After the puppies graduate from the prison training, they receive an additional three months of formal training, O\u2019Brien said. The group then flies the veterans in and houses them for two weeks while they work with their new puppies. Veterans are never charged for the service; the organization relies largely on donations.\n\nCatherine Abramshe, the other veteran who spoke at Thursday\u2019s ceremony, said her post-traumatic stress disorder is still so bad that her life in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania sometimes feels like \u201ca beautiful prison.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSorry guys,\u201d she said to the inmates, after delivering that line in her speech.\n\nAbramshe was working as a paramedic in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001; her partner, Ricardo Quinn, was among those killed in the attack. She deployed to Iraq as a medic in 2003, and said she began suffering symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in 2005.\n\nShe got divorced and lost her job. Before she was paired with Chesty, a 3-year-old black Lab, there were days when she stayed huddled under her covers.\n\n\u201cIt is because of you that I get out of bed every day,\u201d she told the inmates, some of whom were cradling and petting the next round of service dogs during the ceremony. \u201cI will never forget how selfless you were giving up your time and your heart.\u201d", "description": "As soon as one dog recognized the maximum-security prison where he was trained, he started wagging his tail.", "authors": ["Rachel Chason", "Reporter Covering Local Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_gerZe8qReaDXT1nYSi3APBlij4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UMW7YBHXG4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
