It turns out, however, that Facebook\u2019s advertising tools have also marked hundreds of thousands of children as interested in gambling and alcohol, opening them up to some not-so-great advertisements.\n\nA joint investigation by The Guardian and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation found that 740,000 children under 18 years old are flagged in Facebook\u2019s ad tools as being interested in gambling. Another 940,000 are marked as interested in alcoholic drinks. Part of the reason why this might have occurred is that Facebook doesn\u2019t break out interest categories by age or reason.\n\nTwitter's Sorry About Using Your Phone Number For Ads It's now established many social media sites are using data we willingly forfeited to conduct targeted advertising. Twitter is the latest to join the club after it confirmed it was conducting targeted advertising using phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication.

For starters, exploitative games \u2014 think deceptive loot boxes \u2014 can target children marked as interested in gambling and that technically wouldn\u2019t breach any of Facebook\u2019s rules. (Facebook already got in trouble earlier this year for knowingly refusing refunds to parents whose kids unknowingly racked up thousands of dollars in charges.)\n\nFacebook currently lists ads referencing alcohol and gambling as \u201crestricted content.\u201d For alcohol, Facebook\u2019s policy page states, \u201cAds that promote or reference alcohol must comply with all applicable local laws, required or established industry codes, guidelines, licenses and approvals, and include age and country targeting criteria consistent with Facebook\u2019s targeting guidelines and applicable laws.\u201d For gambling, it notes real-money games or lotteries must have prior written permission and must target people 18 years or older.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told Gizmodo over email, \u201cWe don\u2019t allow ads that promote the sale of alcohol or gambling to minors on Facebook and we enforce against this activity when we find it. We also work closely with regulators to provide guidance for marketers to help them reach their audiences effectively and responsibly.\u201d\n\nThe problem is Facebook isn\u2019t exactly proactive about ads that run afoul of its policies. It primarily relies on an automated review process for ads that don\u2019t follow the rules. In a perfect world, that means any ad that violated Facebook\u2019s policies would be rejected before running. However, the world is not perfect and neither is automated review. As it stands, dubious ads could already reach a child\u2019s eyeballs before Facebook\u2019s even aware and can take action. Users can report ads, sure, but by then there\u2019s no telling how many people it\u2019s reached.\n\nIn general, Facebook has fumbled how it handles children on its platform. While it does restrict anyone under 13 years old from making accounts, plenty of people break that rule and go unreported. It also only recently stopped showing ads for gun accessories to children last year. Facebook launched a Messenger Kids app that\u2019s exclusively designed for kids as young as 6 last year, in spite of protests from child health advocates. Then, this past July, it was reported that the app let children talk to unauthorised strangers \u2014 the one thing it wasn\u2019t supposed to prevent.", "description": "It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that whatever you do on Facebook eventually comes back to you in the form of targeted ads.
