the secretariat of state and the Vatican's financial intelligence unit - as part of an investigation by Vatican criminal prosecutors into alleged financial irregularities surrounding a 150 million euro investment into London real estate.\n\nThe deal, which allegedly resulted in middlemen ripping off millions of euros from the Holy See over the past decade, has itself raised questions about the Vatican's murky finances and poor investment strategies in the past decade.\n\nThe raids and related suspensions, launched following more recent efforts to recover some of the lost money, were highly unusual for the Vatican and sparked fresh speculation about its Machiavellian turf battles, power struggles and score-settling.\n\nVatican head of security Domenico Giani, right, flanks Pope Francis' pope mobile at the end of a canonization Mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday\n\nGiani, top center, speaks to a group of cardinals during a canonization Mass over the weekend\n\nThat the alleged leaker remains unknown has added to the mystery surrounding the case, which has implicated high-ranking Vatican cardinals and monsignors.\n\nIn this instance, officials have spoken openly of an institutional crisis, particularly over the raid on the financial intelligence unit known as the Financial Information Authority.\n\nThe office shares financial information with counterparts in dozens of countries as part of global efforts to crack down on money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nNational financial intelligence units might be unwilling to share sensitive information with the Holy See if raids were executed without sufficient cause.\n\nTo date, the Vatican hasn't said what, if any, evidence it has of the agency's wrongdoing.\n\nThe decree authorising the search, seen by The Associated Press, said only that the agency's role in the effort to recover lost funds was 'not clear.'\n\nInternational officials familiar with the case said the agency had in recent months been working with its international counterparts to trace financial flows of the middlemen who were accused of defrauding the Vatican in the real estate deal, suggesting the raids were meant to stop the investigation in its tracks before officials inside and out of the Vatican who might be benefiting were caught.\n\nPope Francis is seen at the Vatican walking next to Domenico Giani, Inspector General of the Corpo della Gendarmeria, the police and security force of Vatican City, before boarding a bus heading to Ariccia, south of Rome in 2017\n\nGiani's October 2 memo was sent to all Swiss Guards and members of the Vatican gendarmes police force as an internal directive barring entry to the Vatican by the five employees, who were suspended from their jobs as a precaution.\n\nFeaturing the employees' photographs, names and job titles, the directive resembled a wanted poster, even though none of the five was placed under investigation.\n\nL'Espresso and its daily newspaper, La Repubblica, published the directive and it was widely redistributed online.\n\nIn a statement announcing Giani's departure, the Vatican said the publication of the document greatly harmed the employees' dignity as well as the image of the Vatican gendarmes.\n\nGiani himself said that he was ashamed by the publication and that he felt personally for the five employees.\n\nGiani, top, looks at Pope Francis at the end of a canonization Mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday\n\nThe faithful attending the Easter Sunday mass celebrated by Pope Francis (unseen) on Saint Peter's square in the Vatican City, Vatican, in 2018\n\n'Having always said that I would be willing to sacrifice my life to defend the pope, I took the decision to resign with the same spirit, and to not in any way harm the image and activities of the pope,' he told Vatican media.\n\nFrancis met with Giani in recent days and thanked him for his service, professionalism and willingness to step aside as 'an expression of freedom and institutional sensitivity,' the Vatican said.\n\nGiani joined the Vatican police force as the deputy police chief in 1999 after a stint in Italy's financial police and the information department of the Italian premier's office.
