The comments might have left signs of prejudice on the part of the commission.\n\n\u201cSo, first of all, the investigation is led by the chairperson of the commission, Bongani Majola, and it is into whether Jones should continue with the Etzebeth investigation. It is also a full investigation into these alleged remarks,\u201d Gaum told City Press.\n\nREAD: The Etzebeth case: So many questions, but we\u2019ve all made up our minds already\n\nJones was quoted at the community meeting as saying that the commission did not care about the offender\u2019s prominence or standing in society, \u201cwhether you are Eben Etzebeth, Adam Catzavelos or Angelo Agrizzi\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe [Etzebeth] always got away with it. But this time around, it stops here,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nMeanwhile, Gaum\u2019s credibility has also been in the spotlight, as a result of a possible irregularity in the procedure applied to the Etzebeth case.\n\nClaasen states in the letter that the community was left \u201cshocked\u201d after the commission decided to bypass its procedure in this particular case.\n\nAfter the complaint was laid, the commission decided to make it a priority to meet with Etzebeth and his legal team, while excluding complainants and community members.\n\nDeaan Vivier\n\n\u201cWe felt betrayed and a growing sense of mistrust developed between the victims and the Human Rights Commission. This mistrust and frustration was subsequently managed as an intervention by Buang Jones and Chris Nissen, who managed to calm the victims and the community,\u201d the letter read.\n\nThis led the community to continue to cooperate and participate in giving statements and evidence, to the point where the case was submitted to the equality court.\n\nThe meeting with Etzebeth and his legal counsel was held on August 29, and Gaum was among the commissioners in attendance.\n\nGaum then attended a gathering with the Langebaan community on September 1, but allegedly did not mention that the commission had already met with Etzebeth and that it had been concluded that he could go to Japan to participate in the Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cGaum was aware of this alleged agreement but kept quiet and failed to inform the victims, complainants and the affected community about this agreement,\u201d said Claasen.\n\nGaum explained that there was nothing unusual for the commission to deviate from normal procedure, if it was warranted.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to establish is, first of all, whether he would offer his full cooperation with the matter as far as the commission is involved. We wanted to give him the opportunity to provide his version of events.\n\n\u201cIf, for example, he had indicated that he did in fact utter the H-word we would have advised the South African Rugby Union that he should not go to Japan.\u201d\n\nGaum continued: He gave his version and denied these allegations, which means they need to be established. So there was good cause for meeting him before he left. Soon afterwards we met with the community in Langebaan.\n\nThe SAHRC guidelines state that if a complaint is lodged, the matter should first be assigned by a legal practitioner who would speak to the complainant to get details about the matter.\n\nAfter getting this information, a letter must then be sent to the alleged perpetrator in which they would be invited to give their side of the story.\n\nAn assessment would be made by the commission to ascertain whether they would be taking up the matter or utilising alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n\n\nIn this case a letter of complaint was never sent to Etzebeth. However, Gaum said this was not necessary because it was subsequently decided that the matter would be handled by the equality court in Hopefield.\n\n\u201cThe commission did not say, okay you can go to Japan. What the commission did say is that in the meantime, we will liaise with his lawyers.\n\n\u201cWe will not provide him with the allegations letter because we have decided to approach a different forum, which is the equality court,\u201d Gaum said.\n\nThe commissioner was accused of handling the matter speedily because he was scheduled to go to the World Cup as part of a group of officials due to attend the event as the \u201cparliamentary rugby team\u201d.\n\n\u201cDays after the community meeting in Langebaan, we established that this same commissioner (Gaum) left for Japan to be with the Springboks,\u201d Claasen said in the letter.\n\nGaum told City Press that he had been part of the parliamentary team since 1999 and there was no conflict of interest regarding his trip to Japan.", "description": "Signs of cracks within the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) have become visible in the past few weeks, as the organisation handles the controversial hate speech case against Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth.", "authors": ["Queenin Masuabi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/991f33bf9a914c14ae340f98fb7a8e9c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
