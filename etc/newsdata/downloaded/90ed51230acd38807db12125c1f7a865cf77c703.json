Joe AND Hunter Biden Were Both Paid By Burisma", "language": "en", "text": "So, the plot thickens with Joe Biden and his Ukraine ties. House Democrats have pulled the trigger on their grand plan to impeach President Trump for simply winning the 2016 election. They couldn\u2019t get him on impeachment for \"Russian collusion,\" but they\u2019re now using some inaccurate whistleblower report that alleged that President Trump tried to shakedown Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, threatening to withhold military aid unless he opened a corruption investigation into Hunter Biden. Hunter was being paid $50,000/month at his position at Burisma Group, an energy company and a sector of the economy that Biden has zero experience.\n\nAs the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, it seems pretty clear that he was there selling access. That\u2019s the allegation. It\u2019s a question that hasn\u2019t gone away, and one that has irritated Joe Biden to no end. And now we\u2019re hearing that Joe Biden was also paid $900,000 which was part of his lobbying fee on behalf of Burisma. The former vice president has repeatedly said that he and his son never discussed overseas business, despite being pictured in a photograph golfing with two Ukrainian energy executives. They didn\u2019t talk business. Who are you kidding? Our friends at RedState wrote about this earlier today. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, also repeated the claim on Fox News' Sean Hannity Wednesday night (via NY Post):\n\nWATCH: WaPo's Matt Viser says Joe Biden has not addressed the fundamental questions behind Hunter Biden's Ukraine business dealings. pic.twitter.com/NHUGb1c5RS \u2014 America Rising (@AmericaRising) October 10, 2019\n\nRudy Giuliani, the personal lawyer for President Trump, alleged that a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter also paid the former vice president $900,000 in lobbying fees. Giuliani, appearing Wednesday night on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show,\u201d cited as evidence documents released by Andriy Derkach, a member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament. \u201cBiden, his son and his brother had a 30-year-long scam to make money, millions, selling his public office,\u201d Giuliani told Hannity. Derkach held a press conference earlier Wednesday in Kiev where he claimed he had documents showing how Burisma Holdings paid Biden the lobbying fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whistleblower who decided to create this firestorm is reportedly a CIA agent. This person has also been cited for political bias, is a registered Democrat and had worked with a 2020 Democratic candidate. The third citation is unknown. That part is redacted. But the White House released the transcript of the call debunking the quid pro quo allegations. The Ukrainian president also said he didn\u2019t feel like he was being blackmailed. It\u2019s a nothing burger. But the Democrats couldn\u2019t get Trump on \"Russian collusion,\" so they waited until they could find another reason to launch this impeachment circus. Meanwhile, Joe Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine haven\u2019t been resolved and it could become an albatross around his neck as he slips away from frontrunner status.", "description": ".10/10/2019 20:13:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/289/17329344-1af8-4a1f-8631-ab65d20076a0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
