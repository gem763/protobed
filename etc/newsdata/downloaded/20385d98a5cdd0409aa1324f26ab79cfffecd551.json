But now, thanks in part to information from the same Syrian Kurdish allies Trump is accused of abandoning, U.S. analysts believed they had found him.\n\nThe CIA had been honing the intelligence for weeks. The man believed to be Baghdadi was under U.S. surveillance, and his movements were being tracked.\n\nThe American commandos who conducted the operation had been staging in the region since last month. Some of them launched from the Iraqi Kurdish city or Irbil, liberated from Saddam Hussein in 2003 in a war Trump says was a terrible mistake.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama decided to launch the 2011 raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, the CIA wasn't sure bin Laden was there, and the Pakistanis were not told. If the tall man in that compound wasn't bin Laden, it would have been a hard thing to explain. If the Pakistanis defended their territory, there could have been a bloodbath.\n\nThere was no hostile force nearby in this case, given that Trump had received acquiescence from the Russians and Turks, who controlled some of the airspace the U.S. needed to fly through. But the president still had to greenlight a risky operation that could get Americans killed. That was his biggest concern, he said later, and he was gratified that no American was injured, though a military dog was wounded.\n\nTrump knew what it was to send men to their deaths; a Navy SEAL was killed during a controversial raid in the first month of his administration in Yemen.\n\nThis was not the first attempt to get the ISIS leader. Two or three previous launches had been canceled, Trump said, because Baghdadi changed his mind about where he was headed.\n\nThe strong implication was that the U.S. either had a human source in his entourage or were monitoring his communications.\n\n\"Finally we saw that he was held up here. We knew something about the compound,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Sunday.\n\nThere was a tunnel that could have allowed an escape, but \"we had that covered,\" Trump said.\n\nThe helicopters lifted off moments after the White House meeting assembled. Trump and his team \u2014 including Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and Gen. Mark. A Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \u2014 watched a video feed with a definition that the president said was as clear and detailed as you might see in a mall cineplex.\n\n\"Absolutely perfect, as though you were watching a movie,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat they saw or later learned, as Trump told it, was just how a Hollywood script-doctor might have written it.\n\nU.S. aircraft flew low and fast for about an hour and ten minutes over airspace controlled by Turkey and Russia. Officials assumed those flights would be uneventful, but there is always a concern when flying over an adversary armed with sophisticated air defenses.\n\nAs Trump explained it, eight helicopters were met with gunfire as they approached the compound, and returned fire to neutralize the threat.\n\nThe choppers landed, and \"a large crew of brilliant fighters\" emerged. They blew holes into the building to avoid a booby trapped main door.\n\nThey then began capturing fighters, killing anyone who resisted. \"A large number\" of Baghdadi's men were killed, Trump said. Eleven children were moved to a safe location.\n\nChased by U.S. special operations dogs, Baghdadi fled into what the president called a dead-end tunnel with three children. The dogs' names and breeds are classified. The commandos had a robot on scene for such circumstances, but it wasn't deployed.\n\n\"He was screaming, crying and whimpering,\" Trump said. \"He was scared out of his mind.\"\n\nBaghdadi then detonated a suicide vest, ending all four lives and collapsing the tunnel.\n\nThe commandos spent two hours total in the compound, collecting \"highly sensitive\" material, Trump said.\n\nTo be certain of Baghdadi's identity, the operators had a team onsite with samples of his DNA. How they got those samples was not disclosed.\n\nThey conducted a field test on the mutilated remains, to prove they had the right target.\n\n\"100 percent Jackpot, over,\" was the radio call from the special operations commander, once the DNA match was confirmed.\n\nThe founder of the world's most fearsome terror group was no more.\n\nThe implications for the fight against ISIS were uncertain, experts said, given the new instability in the region in the wake of Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops. But this was without a doubt a big counterterrorism win.\n\n\"He died like a dog,\" said Trump. \"He died like a coward.\"", "description": "Chased by U.S. special operations dogs, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi fled into what President Trump called a dead-end tunnel with three children.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4261660/1000x563_nbc-191027-donald-trump-situation-room-al-1015_2e4245e16092dc4ba2623f01ba8271de.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
