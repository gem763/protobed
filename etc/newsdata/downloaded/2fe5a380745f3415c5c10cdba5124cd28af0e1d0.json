Looking to help from America also seems a forlorn hope. Johnson, who was chosen by 92,000 Conservative Party activists, is leader of a minority government whose hard Brexit line was rejected at the 2017 election and is propped up by a party that does not represent opinion in Northern Ireland, but still seems determined to defy the will of parliament and lead us to ruin.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAdrian Cosker\n\nHitchin, Hertfordshire\n\n\u201cGet Brexit done\u201d seems to have become the mantra for the government. We\u2019ve heard it from just about every minister during and since the Conservative Party conference. Normally, the phrase is followed by the list of promises to address the concerns of every person in the United Kingdom and preceded by, \u201cEvery person I meet tells me that they just want us to ...\u201d.\n\nWhy is the opposition not saying that most people don\u2019t care how Brexit becomes over, just so long as it is? Any of us who are still paying attention know that if the UK exits the EU at any date with any or no deal, it will still be years before there is certainty about the future relationship.\n\nIt is obvious that Brexit will be over if the UK stays in the EU. That can happen quickly if Article 50 is revoked. It can be done unilaterally and it is an action that is in full control of the UK. If the government doesn\u2019t do it, then it is entirely their fault if the UK exits without a deal. Parliament represents all of \u201cthe people\u201d, not just voters. Our representatives must act for what they judge best for the nation. A failure to do so is a failure of their primary duty as MPs.\n\nYes, \u201cthe people\u201d want Brexit done. That does not mean that we want to exit the EU.\n\nPaul Hearn\n\nJuignac, France\n\nShape Created with Sketch. World news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

A plague on all our houses!\n\nIan Henderson\n\nNorwich\n\nKurds and Trump\n\nWashington\u2019s creation of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was in a sense too successful in that the Kurds ended up occupying much of northeast Syria (Turkish jets strike Syria as Erdogan announces start of military operation against Kurdish fighters).\n\nNo thought was given to reconciling Kurdish rule over extensive Arab populated areas. Such an anomalous situation provides a breeding ground for a resurgent Isis. More significantly, Washington must have known that Turkey would never tolerate a bordering Kurdish state. Syria\u2019s Kurds would have been better off aligning themselves with Assad.\n\nYugo Kovach\n\nDorset \u200b\n\nArdern for the Peace prize\n\nThe Nobel Peace prize has always been a source of controversy in the past. Who does not remember Aung San Suu Kyi, when she denied the colossal magnitude of human rights abuses towards the Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar; or the Dalai Lama\u2019s ineptitude and silence towards atrocities in Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and elsewhere; or even the late Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin at a time when peace in the holy land remains more elusive than ever.\n\nFor that, Jacinda Ardern genuinely deserves this accolade this year. When Muslims fell victim of religious persecution and violence in Christchurch, she was truly an enduring source of hope, empathy, strength, courage and inspiration. She wore hijab, read the Quran and visited mosques, and mobilised entire communities to come together, transcend boundaries of hatred and despair to build bridges of hope. No one can extinguish the fires of wars and divisions in our world but at least her deeds and words made a difference to countless lives during dark times and will inspire others for decades to come.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\u200b\n\nLondon NW2", "description": "Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings\u2019 plan to provoke the EU into appearing uncompromising seems to be working and is apparently entering its next vile stage: the stirring up, perhaps by proxies,\u00a0of anti-EU, anti-Irish\u00a0and in particular, anti-German sentiment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/19/cummings-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
