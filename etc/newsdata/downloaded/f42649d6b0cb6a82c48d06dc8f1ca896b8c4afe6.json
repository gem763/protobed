But mum-of-two Lauren Gregory is adamant that carving out just 15 minutes to go for a jog can be the difference between a mother coping or falling apart.\n\n\u201cRunning for me means getting much-needed headspace, it is a little break from the constant demands of motherhood,\u201d says Lauren, 40, a longterm endurance runner. \u201cThanks to running, I\u2019m a better mum because I\u2019m more equipped for the harder days, and I have more energy. It really helps me, and I really wanted other women to experience the benefits. I especially wanted to share with other women how important it is to have your own thing.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Lauren used a local mums\u2019 Facebook group to post a tongue-in-cheek call-out titled Run Like a Girl, looking for women who might like to meet up in her hometown Leamington Spa and go for a run. \u201cThere was no plan, I just gave the details of a Tuesday night meet up and I was thrilled when 23 ladies turned up. I had no idea there were so many people out there who wanted to do it. I am just as thrilled and proud now when hundreds of ladies turn up at a session.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOff the back of the success of that first meet up Lauren set up a Run Like a Girl Facebook group, and soon after she created a free eight-week plan for novice runners to follow. Her friend Rebecca Chumun came on board as co-founder to help develop the group. As the weekly meet-ups garnered more and more interest, Run Like a Girl helped to resurrect a vision of running not as a solo sport but as something that shows the power of community. As well as this - and crucial to Lauren\u2019s vision - it helped to teach women to invest in themselves.\n\n\u201cWomen are often their own worst critics when it comes to body image and self-esteem, but I found running can be one of the best remedies,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cIt taught me what my body was capable of and I felt empowered to share this with others.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The Movers List Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The Movers List 1/50 Al Hopkins, Running (Edinburgh) Al Hopkins (they/them) found traditional sport environments can be intimidating for the LGBTI+ community so joined Edinburgh Frontrunners, part of a global community for LGBTI+ people to move, make friends and belong. They've since worked with ScottishAthletics and others to increase diversity and introduce the non-binary category into running and other sports. \u201cTen years ago I would never have believed that future me would have come out as pansexual and non-binary and I\u2019d be President of a running club and a race organiser. It's no exaggeration to say running has changed my life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 2/50 Alex Gibson, Disability Sports (Brentwood) When nutritional therapist and fitness fanatic Alex Gibson was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in January 2018, he was determined not to let that stop him and other MND sufferers from challenging themselves. With the help of his friends, he set up CHALLENGING MND, a charity dedicated to providing support and assistance to those living with MND to complete memorable activities while they can. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being active and keeping mobile channels my mind to stay focused now more than ever. Through the charity, we\u2019ve met a wide array of people living with MND, each with different demands on their bodies but despite the way the disease affects what the body can do, the mind remains sharp. We\u2019ve recently helped an MND sufferer to climb the Matterhorn mountain in Switzerland and I took on the Three Peaks challenge myself last month to fundraise for the charity. I want everyone with MND to feel empowered by being active while they can.\u201d Lucozade Sport 3/50 Asa Waite, Basketball (Newport) Asa Waite first fell in love with the fashion of basketball but in 2013 he set up his own team, the Newport Aces, to encourage local children to get moving. He now runs seven teams and has hundreds of kids taking part in a sport that inspires confidence. \u201cThe growth of the club means I spend more time coaching than playing but it still keeps me active and I\u2019m doing something I love. My aim is to get more female players, especially from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, interested in basketball.\u201d Lucozade Sport 4/50 Bella Mackie, Running (London) When Bella Mackie\u2019s marriage broke up, her mental health hit rock bottom. She started running to ease her anxiety and wrote a book about the experience. Jog On was published in 2018 and became an instant bestseller, inspiring people to take to the road and run to better their mental health. \u201cRunning came as a form of therapy at a really low point in my life. It is my escape, like running away, but you can get back again. It makes me feel in control of what I\u2019m doing, and to feel strong and feel powerful.\u201d Lucozade Sport 5/50 Benjamin Wimbush, Disability Sports (Manchester) Benjamin Wimbush broke his neck in a life-changing trampolining accident eight years ago. He started the #20isplenty movement as a way to help able-bodied, disabled people, and sufferers of mental health to connect with and motivate each other. \u201cMy accident has made me increasingly aware of how not exercising can have serious implications for your muscles and your mental health. The #20isplenty campaign came about as a means for me to cope and stay motivated.\u201d Lucozade Sport 6/50 Born Barikor, HIIT (London) Working at a leisure centre he could not afford to join himself, inspired fitness fanatic Born Barikor to change the way people exercise by creating \u201cgyms without walls\u201d. He founded OurParks in 2014 to provide free group exercise classes run by fitness experts in community spaces. Over 100,000 people have now taken part in OurParks classes around the UK. \u201cGrowing up on a council estate things could have gone one of two ways, but I\u2019m grateful for the opportunities being active has given me to travel and meet new people.\u201d Lucozade Sport 7/50 Carl Adams, Running Wild (Ashford) Carl Adams turned to the trees to escape alcohol. Together with partner Steve Denby, he co-founded Primal Roots a social enterprise that runs forest fitness classes helping people who\u2019ve experienced homelessness and those looking to overcome addiction to rebuild their lives through natural movement and kinship. \u201cAt a time when people are feeling at their lowest, a flashy gym might not help, but when working out in the woods with people who\u2019ve got similar stories, people start to thrive.\u201d Lucozade Sport 8/50 Dr. Catherine Walter, Powerlifting (Oxford) An Emeritus Fellow in Applied Linguistics by day, and captain of Oxford University\u2019s Linacre College female powerlifting club by night, 72 year-old Dr. Catherine Walter wants to encourage other women to weightlift and believes it is never too late to find a sport that you love. \u201cPowerlifting is you and the weight, and gravity. It takes you completely away from the cares of the normal day. Lifting with a group makes for a community of strong people; it gives you confidence. Also, you learn to accept failure: if you never fail, you're not challenging yourself enough.\u201d Lucozade Sport 9/50 Charlie Dark, Running (London) Working in the fast-paced music industry for many years took a toll on Charlie Dark. Running was an escape. In 2007 he founded Run Dem Crew, a community for like-minded people to meet, exchange ideas, and run. The Crew is now 500 members strong and regularly runs in London and other cities across the world. \u201cMy background as a DJ means I bring people together to move as one \u2013 and running is another way of doing that. Run Dem Crew gets people to connect and meet new people offering each other sources of change and inspiration.\u201d Lucozade Sport 10/50 Charlotte Roach, HIIT (Chester) A near-fatal cycling accident put an end to a promising athletic career for 30-year-old Charlotte Roach. But from the pain was born Rabble, a new business that introduces classic playground games as high-intensity exercise. With the backing of her Olympic mentor, Dame Kelly Holmes, Rabble now has over 900 regular members across several U.K. cities. \u201cWhen I stopped being a full-time athlete, I realised that you don\u2019t need to have performance goals to feel like you\u2019ve achieved, you just need to do something you really enjoy.\u201d Lucozade Sport 11/50 Charmaine Daley, Dance (Nottingham) After being made redundant for the third time, Charmaine Daley attended a Zumba class and decided she wanted to do it for a living. After training as an instructor, she started organising Zumba networking events in her community. Full of positivity, she was chosen to inspire others through the national \u2018This Girl Can\u2019 initiative and is a UK Coaching Ambassador. \u201cLife is hard for so many of us, but moving is a way for everybody to be able to switch off. Being in a room full of like-minded people is so empowering.\u201d Lucozade Sport 12/50 Dan Charlish, Snowsports (Hove) Inspired by a group of teenagers saying that playing Xbox snowsports games was the closest they would get to winter sports, Dan Charlish started Snow-Camp. It is the UK\u2019s only charity encouraging and inspiring inner-city young people to excel through a combination of skiing, snowboarding, life-skills and vocational training. \u201cI noticed there was a gap between young people who enjoyed playing snowsports videogames and not experiencing it for real. Our charity is removing barriers for young people across the country by helping them to open up and address issues.\u201d Lucozade Sport 13/50 Dan Edwardes, Parkour (London) Dan Edwardes founded Parkour Generations in 2005, a multi-national organisation that runs coaching certifications, school programmes, workshops and major events in more than 45 countries around the world. It is now the leading authority on parkour education. He has worked with the UK government to create Parkour UK, the world\u2019s first and only recognised national governing body for the sport. \u201cI discovered parkour in my twenties. I learnt fast and what started as a passion then became a career. Because of my background as a university lecturer and martial arts teacher I was always interested in teaching the benefits of this incredible movement discipline to others. I\u2019m active every day, I still train and I have no plans to stop.\u201d Lucozade Sport 14/50 Dave Musgrove, Rock Climbing (Leeds) Born in Leeds, Dave Musgrove has always considered the Yorkshire gritstone and limestone cliffs to be his playground. In the 1990s, he was involved in several accessibility and conservation projects across all the Limestone crags in Yorkshire, ensuring there are safe places for people to start climbing. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the physical challenge of climbing that benefits the people who do it, but it is also the mental release of being active in the great outdoors that helps too. Climbing provides a release from the pressures and tensions of life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 15/50 Dave Player, Motorsports (Newbury) Dave Player suffered a spinal cord injury after leaving the Royal Engineers. Passionate about motorsport, he started Kartforce and Team BRIT with the sole aim of inspiring disabled and struggling veterans to overcome their troubles by being part of a team again. \u201cI wanted to define myself by what I could do, and not what I couldn\u2019t. Motorsport gives you a buzz like nothing else can; it reignites the fire within and helps people rediscover a passion. It\u2019s a charity that I\u2019ve ploughed all I have into, but the rewards in terms of the outcomes for the drivers are far greater than I\u2019d ever imagined.\u201d Lucozade Sport 16/50 Dee Ripoll, Surfer (Edinburgh) Lawyer and semi-pro surfer Dee Ripoll set up her own surf school, Coldwater Surf, and taught across France and her native Scotland. Following two traumatic accidents, she moved to Edinburgh believing her surfing career to be over. After a year of not teaching the sport, she re-established the school to teach people of all ages how to master the waves. She continues to surf all around the world. \u201cI became totally obsessed with mastering surfing as soon as I first saw people doing it because it requires so much determination. If exercising in any form can bring something to your life \u2013 you should embrace it.\u201d Lucozade Sport 17/50 Edwina Brocklesby, Community Sports (London) Edwina Brocklesby spent 50 years as a social worker, running an adoption agency and being a full-time mother to three kids. At 50 she ran her first marathon and has since taken part in marathons, triathlons and Ironman races across the globe. Dubbed #IronGran, Edwina founded SilverFit in 2013 as a way to promote lifelong fitness. SilverFit runs activities in venues across London, offering social and exercise opportunities to OAPs from Nordic walking to Tai Chi. \u201cFor me, it is about fun and companionship. I\u2019m passionate about promoting lifelong fitness; it\u2019s never too late to change your life and get active if my experience is anything to go by.\u201d Lucozade Sport 18/50 Francesca Lewis, Tennis (Swansea) At the age of eight, Francesca Lewis started playing tennis and went on to play at an elite level. She now coaches disadvantaged people in Swansea ranging from 3-year-olds to a 98-year-old. In 2018, she was awarded the Talent Development Coach of the Year and shortlisted for the British Tennis Coach of the Year at the UK Coaching Awards. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that money shouldn\u2019t determine who can and can\u2019t play sport, and that was my motivation as a coach \u2013 to make tennis more accessible to all by removing the cost of a sport as a barrier.\u201d Lucozade Sport 19/50 Gundeep Anand, Street Football (London) Gundeep Anand is the mind behind The Last Stand, a street football tournament created to unite communities and break down social, cultural and religious barriers through sport. It has inspired similar events to start all over the world. \u201cI\u2019m forever grateful to football and think that the sport, in general, is magical. It provides an opportunity for people to bond and unite under a shared cultural identity.\u201d Lucozade Sport 20/50 Hannah Hawkey, Dance (Plymouth) Hannah Hawkey quit her teaching job to combine her love of rock music and dance and set up RockFit, a fitness class set to a heavy metal and rock soundtrack. The unique concept has received requests from all over the world and now has classes in Plymouth, Bristol and Glasgow. \u201cI grew up dancing and know music can be a massive motivation in getting active. Most of the music played in gyms wasn\u2019t my type of music so, in 2016, I set up RockFit, an inclusive class that gets people exercising to a rocking soundtrack. My members often say that a class feels like a gig.\u201d Lucozade Sport 21/50 Helen Mackenzie, Netball (Ripon) PE teacher and founder of the Ripon City Netball Club, Helen Mackenzie started the club when she was recovering from breast cancer and wanted something to enjoy with her two daughters. She wants to inspire women of all ages to take up a competitive team sport and enjoy the health and social benefits it can bring. \u201cMy club instils confidence and gives women the courage to walk through the door and take up a sport, regardless of their age or ability. I\u2019m passionate about getting people more active and feel that children seeing their mums involved in sport is a great place to start.\u201d Lucozade Sport 22/50 Ivo Gormley, Running (London) Fetching a newspaper for an elderly neighbour sparked an idea in Ivo Gormley who wanted to combine running with good deeds. GoodGym is a community of runners who are helping combat loneliness and isolation by, quite literally, running errands for those that need it, and by doing manual labour for community projects. \u201cRunning sharpens my mind and makes me feel alive. The best thing about GoodGym is hearing the stories from the different people involved. Making new friends, reconnecting with the older generation, and keeping fit; almost everyone who takes part says it has increased their motivation to exercise.\u201d Lucozade 23/50 Jen Blackwell, Dance (Preston) Having Down\u2019s Syndrome has not stopped Jen Blackwell from following her passions. A love of dance encouraged her to start DanceSyndrome, a place for similar people to come together and experience happiness through dance. \u201cI wanted to dance and make my own choreography, but there wasn\u2019t anything out there for someone like me so, with the help of my parents, I started DanceSyndrome. Dancing makes me feel powerful. It comes from my heart and makes me feel like I\u2019m flying. It keeps me healthy and makes my body feel happy.\u201d Lucozade Sport 24/50 Jess Melia, Skateboarding (Leeds) After beginning to skate in 2018, Jess Melia created Rollin\u2019 With The Girls \u2013 a skateboarding initiative aimed at inspiring women to get on their boards and give skateboarding a go. Using social media to arrange meet-ups, post video clips and grow awareness, Rollin\u2019 With The Girls now has over 2,000 followers. \u201cSkating has taught me that it doesn't matter if it takes you days, weeks or months, persistence will always pay off.\u201d Lucozade Sport 25/50 John Croot, Walking Football (Chesterfield) As the Chief Executive of the Chesterfield FC Community Trust, and pioneer of modern Walking Football, John Croot encourages the sport as a way to engage the over-50s in the area. It is now played in over 50 countries around the world, and there are over 60,000 players in the U.K. alone. \u201cI thought about how you could make football easier for older people and that\u2019s when I thought of introducing Walking Football to the club. It\u2019s not just the physical element that I enjoy, but also the social aspect. Having a group of friends in later life can be hugely rewarding, but not always easy to achieve.\u201d Lucozade Sport 26/50 Josh Landmann, Para-athletics (Poulton-Le-Flyde) Since a swimming accident aged 20 left him paralysed from the chest down, Josh Landmann has been determined to keep moving. He has become an award-winning para-athlete and, when his involvement in a ToughMudder event went viral and inspired people around the world. In April 2019, Josh broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest marathon completed in a non-racing wheelchair. \u201cKeeping active and engaging in sport has helped me through dark times, and I\u2019m now committed to getting more wheelchair users like me to take part in sports.\u201d Lucozade Sport 27/50 Kate Rew, Outdoor Swimming (Somerset) Author Kate Rew\u2019s founded in 2006 The Outdoor Swimming Society when swimming outdoors was dwindling, with the aim to inspire people to swim outdoors and give them the information to do it safely. Starting with just a handful of swimmers, the society has grown to over 70,000 members. \u201cI grew up on a farm with a river running through it, so water was a natural place to roam. The Outdoor Swimming Society, and everything we\u2019ve done to create the wild swimming movement, is all drawn from that starting point \u2013 of feeling a natural inclination to get in water, and happiness as a result of it. As well as creating a swimming movement, we\u2019ve created an alternative economy with people donating their time and talents to sharing the swim love. People call us \u2018the most magic club in the world\u2019 and the \u2018nicest place on the internet\u2019. I love swimming for the same reasons I always did, but now I have a whole community to love around it \u2013 if you haven\u2019t already, jump in and join us. Lucozade Sport 28/50 Katee Hui, Football (London) Katee Hui was a keen footballer in Hamilton, Canada, but when she moved to East London, she could not find enough opportunities for females to play. So, she started her own and founded Hackney Laces community club in 2011. It now runs as a social franchise in three London boroughs. In addition to providing football to hundreds of girls and women, there's an \u201coff the pitch\u201d programme designed to inspire and support participants beyond football. \u201cFootball empowers people, builds friendships and boosts physical and mental health so I thought it was important to create a place woman can play. The Laces has become more than a club, it\u2019s a family, a community, a place to go and belong.\u201d Lucozade Sport 29/50 Keith Whitton, Rink Hockey (Doncaster) Keith Whitton travels dozens of miles a week to inspire newcomers to try the sport he has loved for over 50 years, Rink Hockey. He saved his local club, the Sheffield Wildcats, from disbanding in 2015 and the sport has since gone from strength to strength with multiple teams competing every week. \u201cI tried Rink Hockey in 1968 and I have been involved in the sport ever since. I firmly believe that Rink Hockey has always given me good health and fitness as well as a real sense of belonging.\u201d Lucozade Sport 30/50 Khadijah Safari, Martial Arts (Milton Keynes) After failing to find a martial art class she could take without wearing her hijab, Khadijah Safari quit her job as a graphic designer and set up London\u2019s first women-only martial arts club, Safari Kickboxing. It is a safe space for Muslim and non-Muslim women to mix, train together in self-defence and keep fit. \u201cThe first class was packed out with one of the women travelling a six-hour round trip just to be there. It was clear from the start that the women really needed this. We created a safe, empowering environment where women can feel strong and powerful.\u201d Lucozade Sport 31/50 Lauren Gregory, Running (Leamington Spa) Lauren Gregory founded Run Like A Girl after gaining confidence from a charity ultramarathon which she took part in. What started as a social media post to local mums has now grown into a running club with over 3,000 throughout Warwickshire and Australia. \u201cWhen 300 women turned up one evening, we caused town gridlock and realised we were on to something. The aim is that women, mums especially, can get a bit of valuable \u2018me time' to exercise and socialise.\u201d Lucozade Sport 32/50 Leanne Davies, Running (Leatherhead) After a second baby, Leanne Davies struggled to keep to fixed commitments or structured running club times. Frustrated by this, she set up a small Facebook Group of three women that steadily grew in popularity with members joining from all over the U.K. Six years later Run Mummy Run has reached over 62,000 members. \u201cMy life feels incredibly manic at times; I have two young boys, a busy household and Run Mummy Run, which has grown into a full-time job. Juggling all of that can be quite intense so having the ability to shut the door behind me, head to the trails and find some calm and perspective really helps me find that balance in life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 33/50 Leanne Pero, Dance (London) Movement Factory is the vision of Leanne Pero who, in 2001 at the age of 15, set out to create lasting community impact and change through her love of dance. Its mission is positive empowerment, personal development and a fun creative outlet for improving health. Over 500,000 young people have been inspired to move thanks to the Movement Factory. \u201cRealising how dance had benefitted me at an early age was enough to start my own company when I was 15. For us, it is not about how well you can dance, but that you and your community are coming together to do it.\u201d Lucozade Sport 34/50 Linda Hesselden, Ballet (Plymouth) Inspired by assisting her mother in her dance school in the 1970s, Linda Hesselden became a member of the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD). For over 20 years her community school has taught hundreds of people from pre-school children to men and women in their 80s. She is also a Silver Swans licensee and leads a group at her school in Plymouth. Silver Swans is a RAD initiative which enables students aged 55 and over to learn ballet. \u201cDance has a special effect on those who do it for the first time, regardless of age. The smiles on their faces are priceless, and it\u2019s that love that motivates me.\u201d Lucozade Sport 35/50 Louisa Chatwin, Ice-Skating (Selston) Over the last decade, Louisa Chatwin has taught hundreds of adults and children how to improve their skills on the ice. In the 2017 World Winter Games, she was selected as Team GB head coach for the Special Olympics following her work with para-skate star, Meg McFarlane. \u201cSkating is such a sociable activity that really helps build confidence and enables friends and family to move and feel supportive of each other too. People can be put off by the thought of it being too difficult as it can be technically more demanding than other sports, but part of the sense of achievement comes from mastering the skates and using it as an escape from everyday life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 36/50 Mac Ferrari, Cycling (London) Founder of Bikestormz and the unofficial godfather to the U.K. #BikeLifeMovement, former gang member Mac Ferrari has encouraged thousands to take part in mass ride-outs and promotes the message of \u201cBikes Up, Knives Down\u201d. \u201cBikestormz started because I saw groups of kids across London who were into bikes but didn\u2019t know of each other. We found a way of bringing them together to be actively engaged in a good cause whilst showcasing their talents.\u201d Lucozade Sport 37/50 Melanie Timberlake, Martial Arts (Aylesbury) Melanie Timberlake has shown phenomenal resilience to overcome post-natal depression and brain surgery to inspire others through a shared love of sport. She manages three disability football teams and runs martial arts classes for the disabled \u2013 and received the prestigious Disability Coach of the Year at the UK Coaching Awards. \u201cI never wanted my son to ever say \u201cI can\u2019t do something\u201d because of his autism. I\u2019m now a manager of his team and coach more than 60 kids a week. I believe that anybody can do any sport, it\u2019s just down to how it\u2019s taught and treating people like people.\u201d Lucozade Sport 38/50 Michaella Robb, Paddleboard Yoga (Angus) Michaella Robb is one of the first paddleboard yoga instructors in the U.K. After discovering the sport while travelling, she brought the concept home to Scotland, inspiring others and motivating them to enjoy the sport in the great outdoors. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was into gymnastics and dance, but my love for more extreme sports increased as I got older until I discovered stand up paddleboarding yoga when travelling. I now want to inspire others to discover SUP yoga and get out in nature.\u201d Lucozade Sport 39/50 Oliur Rahman, Community Sports (London) Oliur Rahman started the Active Communities Network to engage young people living in areas of high deprivation to develop an interest and build careers in sport and exercise. The programme supports members in a range of weekly sessions from boxing to basketball. \u201cWhatever the sport, the ethos remains the same, it\u2019s about empowerment, arming young people with the confidence and skills to become leaders and to shape their own communities.\u201d Lucozade Sport 40/50 Paul Sinton-Hewitt, Running (London) Paul Sinton-Hewitt started parkrun, the free 5k run, with thirteen people in Bushy Park, London. It now has five million registered runners worldwide with over 280,000 people regularly running each week in 1,500 global events. \u201cA parkrun is a social gathering that happens to have a running event as a backdrop. By sticking to our goal from the outset, of being a free event that removes all barriers to movement, we\u2019re also having a positive impact on health and wellbeing and social isolation.\u201d Lucozade Sport 41/50 Phil & Shaun Webb, Ultimate Frisbee (Glasgow) Brothers Phil and Shaun Webb founded Glasgow Ultimate frisbee club and are credited with helping establish and expand the sport throughout Scotland in universities, parks and communities. \u201cWhat we love about Ultimate Frisbee is that it is a fast-paced, dynamic game that keeps you fit. Our motivation to start the club came from a strong desire to provide playing and training opportunities for the local community to train and to make the sport accessible to all.\u201d Lucozade Sport 42/50 Philip Collins, Swimming (London) Philip Collins is the Chair of Out to Swim, an aquatics club for LGBTI+ adults in London, Brighton and Bristol. Founded 27 years ago by a small band of swimmers it is now the biggest LGBTI+ swimming club in the Europe. \u201cThe social element of Out To Swim is one of the main reasons why people join, especially if they\u2019re new to a city. We compete in local, national and international events, both straight and gay, and I still swim two to three times a week. It not only keeps me physically active, but the mental benefits from socialising with friends make it doubly rewarding.\u201d Lucozade Sport 43/50 Sarah Javaid, Cycling (London) Sarah Javaid set up Cycle Sisters to help Muslim women connect and exercise through cycling. It started with her two sisters-in-law and a friend and has grown to over 100 members. \u201cI love that we are normalising cycling for people from different backgrounds and attracting women to cycling who never had a chance to ride before due to cultural reasons or other barriers.\u201d Lucozade Sport 44/50 Shannia Richardson-Gordon, Boxing (London) At only 19, Shannia Richardson Gordon is a coach with Boxing Futures and the Limehouse Boxing Academy. Passionate about how the sport can help others, she travels all over London to teach mental health patients, people with disabilities and young offenders. \u201cI get messages from teenagers all over London who\u2019ve been getting into trouble. I show them that boxing can change their lives. It\u2019s because the discipline influences your all-round lifestyle. It provides structure and builds confidence. That makes the time I spend coaching worthwhile and one day I hope to run my own boxing gym.\u201d Lucozade Sport 45/50 Simon Northcott, Disability Sports (Worchester) Simon Northcott served almost 20 years in the police before taking a post as a teaching assistant in a school working with autistic children after developing complex PTSD. While working as the Disability and Inclusion Lead for Worcester Warriors Rugby Club, he developed a passion for more inclusive forms of sport and invented Hugby where scrums, line-outs and tackling are done by hugging the opponent. He has established initiatives such as Lead the Way, a campaign to ensure vulnerable people feel safe and protected to play and watch sport, and also Tackling Dementia, a weekly event where people with dementia can access sport. \u201cThe impact Hugby is having with those taking part goes beyond just being a novel sport. I have players who talk about how it has helped them to build social networks and restored their self-esteem. We offer Hugby for everyone living in low socioeconomic areas. As a result, I have discovered a job where the rewards provide me with my own occupational therapy\u201d. Lucozade Sport 46/50 Skye Stewart, Football (Wolverhampton) Skye Stewart founded Black Country Fusion FC, the first LGBTI+ inclusive team to enter a non-gay league in the West Midlands. The open-minded football club has gone on to establish a female team and a veteran\u2019s team for men over 35. \u201cI\u2019m part of something that\u2019s genuinely inspiring people who once shared my reluctance for sport, but now get into football and other activities. To get more active you often need to overcome mental as well as physical barriers too, but when you do, the rewards are massive.\u201d Lucozade Sport 47/50 Sophia Warner, Sprinting (Ockley) Born with cerebral palsy, Sophia fought the odds and became a Paralympic track and field athlete. Inspired by her experiences, Sophia founded the Superhero Series in 2016, for disabled people to take part in sport alongside their friends and families. \u201cI know first-hand what a hugely positive impact sport can have on a person\u2019s life. I\u2019ve learnt along the way that the biggest barrier to people with disabilities taking part in sport is the lack of confidence. I set up the Superhero Series to give people with any type of disability, visible or invisible, the confidence and opportunity to move, engage and enjoy sport as I have.\u201d Lucozade Sport 48/50 Tanayah Sam, Cricket (Birmingham) Ex-convict Tanayah Sam works with young people in schools and prisons at risk of joining gang culture to find a path through life using sport. His 12-week programme uses cricket to encourage social cohesion and steer young people away from crime and anti-social behaviour. \u201cWhen I was in jail, I noticed how the only place that never got trashed was the gym. I helped set up a sports academy doing football, cricket, and basketball and bringing in coaches who acted as mentors too. Sports is great, it can help tackle low self-esteem, depression, obesity and also be a tool for mediation and diffuse conflicts.\u201d Lucozade Sport 49/50 Wendy Rumble, Running (Maidenhead) Living an active lifestyle can be challenging when you are a new parent. Wendy Rumble leads a buggy running movement with an educational website, online community and a running club, Buggy Squad, to inspire parents and families to find the freedom to exercise. \u201cWhen my children came along I got a buggy designed for running and set about letting other people know about all the benefits of buggy running. I have met with the Prime Minister, Minister for Sport and English Athletics to talk about the health benefits and freedom it brings to so many new parents.\u201d Lucozade Sport 50/50 Wendy Russell, Hockey (Brighton & Hove) After being diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus, Wendy Russell set up the first deaf hockey session in the country at Brighton and Hove Hockey Club. She worked with Remark to develop 40 new sign language signs for hearing-impaired players of all ages, which has now been rolled out by UK Deaf Sport and England Hockey to make hockey accessible to hearing impaired and deaf people across the whole of the country, and she is also a UK Coaching Ambassador. \u201cWhen I was coaching two girls whose parents are deaf, I became aware of the lack of provision for deaf children to do sports in the area. I wanted to find a way that they could communicate with their team-mates and respond to the umpire. I think that to engage people in sport, you\u2019ve got to be willing to experiment and make it fun first\u201d. Lucozade Sport 1/50 Al Hopkins, Running (Edinburgh) Al Hopkins (they/them) found traditional sport environments can be intimidating for the LGBTI+ community so joined Edinburgh Frontrunners, part of a global community for LGBTI+ people to move, make friends and belong. They've since worked with ScottishAthletics and others to increase diversity and introduce the non-binary category into running and other sports. \u201cTen years ago I would never have believed that future me would have come out as pansexual and non-binary and I\u2019d be President of a running club and a race organiser. It's no exaggeration to say running has changed my life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 2/50 Alex Gibson, Disability Sports (Brentwood) When nutritional therapist and fitness fanatic Alex Gibson was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in January 2018, he was determined not to let that stop him and other MND sufferers from challenging themselves. With the help of his friends, he set up CHALLENGING MND, a charity dedicated to providing support and assistance to those living with MND to complete memorable activities while they can. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being active and keeping mobile channels my mind to stay focused now more than ever. Through the charity, we\u2019ve met a wide array of people living with MND, each with different demands on their bodies but despite the way the disease affects what the body can do, the mind remains sharp. We\u2019ve recently helped an MND sufferer to climb the Matterhorn mountain in Switzerland and I took on the Three Peaks challenge myself last month to fundraise for the charity. I want everyone with MND to feel empowered by being active while they can.\u201d Lucozade Sport 3/50 Asa Waite, Basketball (Newport) Asa Waite first fell in love with the fashion of basketball but in 2013 he set up his own team, the Newport Aces, to encourage local children to get moving. He now runs seven teams and has hundreds of kids taking part in a sport that inspires confidence. \u201cThe growth of the club means I spend more time coaching than playing but it still keeps me active and I\u2019m doing something I love. My aim is to get more female players, especially from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, interested in basketball.\u201d Lucozade Sport 4/50 Bella Mackie, Running (London) When Bella Mackie\u2019s marriage broke up, her mental health hit rock bottom. She started running to ease her anxiety and wrote a book about the experience. Jog On was published in 2018 and became an instant bestseller, inspiring people to take to the road and run to better their mental health. \u201cRunning came as a form of therapy at a really low point in my life. It is my escape, like running away, but you can get back again. It makes me feel in control of what I\u2019m doing, and to feel strong and feel powerful.\u201d Lucozade Sport 5/50 Benjamin Wimbush, Disability Sports (Manchester) Benjamin Wimbush broke his neck in a life-changing trampolining accident eight years ago. He started the #20isplenty movement as a way to help able-bodied, disabled people, and sufferers of mental health to connect with and motivate each other. \u201cMy accident has made me increasingly aware of how not exercising can have serious implications for your muscles and your mental health. The #20isplenty campaign came about as a means for me to cope and stay motivated.\u201d Lucozade Sport 6/50 Born Barikor, HIIT (London) Working at a leisure centre he could not afford to join himself, inspired fitness fanatic Born Barikor to change the way people exercise by creating \u201cgyms without walls\u201d. He founded OurParks in 2014 to provide free group exercise classes run by fitness experts in community spaces. Over 100,000 people have now taken part in OurParks classes around the UK. \u201cGrowing up on a council estate things could have gone one of two ways, but I\u2019m grateful for the opportunities being active has given me to travel and meet new people.\u201d Lucozade Sport 7/50 Carl Adams, Running Wild (Ashford) Carl Adams turned to the trees to escape alcohol. Together with partner Steve Denby, he co-founded Primal Roots a social enterprise that runs forest fitness classes helping people who\u2019ve experienced homelessness and those looking to overcome addiction to rebuild their lives through natural movement and kinship. \u201cAt a time when people are feeling at their lowest, a flashy gym might not help, but when working out in the woods with people who\u2019ve got similar stories, people start to thrive.\u201d Lucozade Sport 8/50 Dr. Catherine Walter, Powerlifting (Oxford) An Emeritus Fellow in Applied Linguistics by day, and captain of Oxford University\u2019s Linacre College female powerlifting club by night, 72 year-old Dr. Catherine Walter wants to encourage other women to weightlift and believes it is never too late to find a sport that you love. \u201cPowerlifting is you and the weight, and gravity. It takes you completely away from the cares of the normal day. Lifting with a group makes for a community of strong people; it gives you confidence. Also, you learn to accept failure: if you never fail, you're not challenging yourself enough.\u201d Lucozade Sport 9/50 Charlie Dark, Running (London) Working in the fast-paced music industry for many years took a toll on Charlie Dark. Running was an escape. In 2007 he founded Run Dem Crew, a community for like-minded people to meet, exchange ideas, and run. The Crew is now 500 members strong and regularly runs in London and other cities across the world. \u201cMy background as a DJ means I bring people together to move as one \u2013 and running is another way of doing that. Run Dem Crew gets people to connect and meet new people offering each other sources of change and inspiration.\u201d Lucozade Sport 10/50 Charlotte Roach, HIIT (Chester) A near-fatal cycling accident put an end to a promising athletic career for 30-year-old Charlotte Roach. But from the pain was born Rabble, a new business that introduces classic playground games as high-intensity exercise. With the backing of her Olympic mentor, Dame Kelly Holmes, Rabble now has over 900 regular members across several U.K. cities. \u201cWhen I stopped being a full-time athlete, I realised that you don\u2019t need to have performance goals to feel like you\u2019ve achieved, you just need to do something you really enjoy.\u201d Lucozade Sport 11/50 Charmaine Daley, Dance (Nottingham) After being made redundant for the third time, Charmaine Daley attended a Zumba class and decided she wanted to do it for a living. After training as an instructor, she started organising Zumba networking events in her community. Full of positivity, she was chosen to inspire others through the national \u2018This Girl Can\u2019 initiative and is a UK Coaching Ambassador. \u201cLife is hard for so many of us, but moving is a way for everybody to be able to switch off. Being in a room full of like-minded people is so empowering.\u201d Lucozade Sport 12/50 Dan Charlish, Snowsports (Hove) Inspired by a group of teenagers saying that playing Xbox snowsports games was the closest they would get to winter sports, Dan Charlish started Snow-Camp. It is the UK\u2019s only charity encouraging and inspiring inner-city young people to excel through a combination of skiing, snowboarding, life-skills and vocational training. \u201cI noticed there was a gap between young people who enjoyed playing snowsports videogames and not experiencing it for real. Our charity is removing barriers for young people across the country by helping them to open up and address issues.\u201d Lucozade Sport 13/50 Dan Edwardes, Parkour (London) Dan Edwardes founded Parkour Generations in 2005, a multi-national organisation that runs coaching certifications, school programmes, workshops and major events in more than 45 countries around the world. It is now the leading authority on parkour education. He has worked with the UK government to create Parkour UK, the world\u2019s first and only recognised national governing body for the sport. \u201cI discovered parkour in my twenties. I learnt fast and what started as a passion then became a career. Because of my background as a university lecturer and martial arts teacher I was always interested in teaching the benefits of this incredible movement discipline to others. I\u2019m active every day, I still train and I have no plans to stop.\u201d Lucozade Sport 14/50 Dave Musgrove, Rock Climbing (Leeds) Born in Leeds, Dave Musgrove has always considered the Yorkshire gritstone and limestone cliffs to be his playground. In the 1990s, he was involved in several accessibility and conservation projects across all the Limestone crags in Yorkshire, ensuring there are safe places for people to start climbing. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the physical challenge of climbing that benefits the people who do it, but it is also the mental release of being active in the great outdoors that helps too. Climbing provides a release from the pressures and tensions of life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 15/50 Dave Player, Motorsports (Newbury) Dave Player suffered a spinal cord injury after leaving the Royal Engineers. Passionate about motorsport, he started Kartforce and Team BRIT with the sole aim of inspiring disabled and struggling veterans to overcome their troubles by being part of a team again. \u201cI wanted to define myself by what I could do, and not what I couldn\u2019t. Motorsport gives you a buzz like nothing else can; it reignites the fire within and helps people rediscover a passion. It\u2019s a charity that I\u2019ve ploughed all I have into, but the rewards in terms of the outcomes for the drivers are far greater than I\u2019d ever imagined.\u201d Lucozade Sport 16/50 Dee Ripoll, Surfer (Edinburgh) Lawyer and semi-pro surfer Dee Ripoll set up her own surf school, Coldwater Surf, and taught across France and her native Scotland. Following two traumatic accidents, she moved to Edinburgh believing her surfing career to be over. After a year of not teaching the sport, she re-established the school to teach people of all ages how to master the waves. She continues to surf all around the world. \u201cI became totally obsessed with mastering surfing as soon as I first saw people doing it because it requires so much determination. If exercising in any form can bring something to your life \u2013 you should embrace it.\u201d Lucozade Sport 17/50 Edwina Brocklesby, Community Sports (London) Edwina Brocklesby spent 50 years as a social worker, running an adoption agency and being a full-time mother to three kids.

In 2018, she was awarded the Talent Development Coach of the Year and shortlisted for the British Tennis Coach of the Year at the UK Coaching Awards. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that money shouldn\u2019t determine who can and can\u2019t play sport, and that was my motivation as a coach \u2013 to make tennis more accessible to all by removing the cost of a sport as a barrier.\u201d Lucozade Sport 19/50 Gundeep Anand, Street Football (London) Gundeep Anand is the mind behind The Last Stand, a street football tournament created to unite communities and break down social, cultural and religious barriers through sport.

It provides an opportunity for people to bond and unite under a shared cultural identity.\u201d Lucozade Sport 20/50 Hannah Hawkey, Dance (Plymouth) Hannah Hawkey quit her teaching job to combine her love of rock music and dance and set up RockFit, a fitness class set to a heavy metal and rock soundtrack. The unique concept has received requests from all over the world and now has classes in Plymouth, Bristol and Glasgow. \u201cI grew up dancing and know music can be a massive motivation in getting active. Most of the music played in gyms wasn\u2019t my type of music so, in 2016, I set up RockFit, an inclusive class that gets people exercising to a rocking soundtrack. My members often say that a class feels like a gig.\u201d Lucozade Sport 21/50 Helen Mackenzie, Netball (Ripon) PE teacher and founder of the Ripon City Netball Club, Helen Mackenzie started the club when she was recovering from breast cancer and wanted something to enjoy with her two daughters. She wants to inspire women of all ages to take up a competitive team sport and enjoy the health and social benefits it can bring. \u201cMy club instils confidence and gives women the courage to walk through the door and take up a sport, regardless of their age or ability. I\u2019m passionate about getting people more active and feel that children seeing their mums involved in sport is a great place to start.\u201d Lucozade Sport 22/50 Ivo Gormley, Running (London) Fetching a newspaper for an elderly neighbour sparked an idea in Ivo Gormley who wanted to combine running with good deeds. GoodGym is a community of runners who are helping combat loneliness and isolation by, quite literally, running errands for those that need it, and by doing manual labour for community projects. \u201cRunning sharpens my mind and makes me feel alive. The best thing about GoodGym is hearing the stories from the different people involved. Making new friends, reconnecting with the older generation, and keeping fit; almost everyone who takes part says it has increased their motivation to exercise.\u201d Lucozade 23/50 Jen Blackwell, Dance (Preston) Having Down\u2019s Syndrome has not stopped Jen Blackwell from following her passions. A love of dance encouraged her to start DanceSyndrome, a place for similar people to come together and experience happiness through dance. \u201cI wanted to dance and make my own choreography, but there wasn\u2019t anything out there for someone like me so, with the help of my parents, I started DanceSyndrome. Dancing makes me feel powerful. It comes from my heart and makes me feel like I\u2019m flying. It keeps me healthy and makes my body feel happy.\u201d Lucozade Sport 24/50 Jess Melia, Skateboarding (Leeds) After beginning to skate in 2018, Jess Melia created Rollin\u2019 With The Girls \u2013 a skateboarding initiative aimed at inspiring women to get on their boards and give skateboarding a go. Using social media to arrange meet-ups, post video clips and grow awareness, Rollin\u2019 With The Girls now has over 2,000 followers. \u201cSkating has taught me that it doesn't matter if it takes you days, weeks or months, persistence will always pay off.\u201d Lucozade Sport 25/50 John Croot, Walking Football (Chesterfield) As the Chief Executive of the Chesterfield FC Community Trust, and pioneer of modern Walking Football, John Croot encourages the sport as a way to engage the over-50s in the area. It is now played in over 50 countries around the world, and there are over 60,000 players in the U.K. alone. \u201cI thought about how you could make football easier for older people and that\u2019s when I thought of introducing Walking Football to the club. It\u2019s not just the physical element that I enjoy, but also the social aspect. Having a group of friends in later life can be hugely rewarding, but not always easy to achieve.\u201d Lucozade Sport 26/50 Josh Landmann, Para-athletics (Poulton-Le-Flyde) Since a swimming accident aged 20 left him paralysed from the chest down, Josh Landmann has been determined to keep moving.

Starting with just a handful of swimmers, the society has grown to over 70,000 members. \u201cI grew up on a farm with a river running through it, so water was a natural place to roam. The Outdoor Swimming Society, and everything we\u2019ve done to create the wild swimming movement, is all drawn from that starting point \u2013 of feeling a natural inclination to get in water, and happiness as a result of it. As well as creating a swimming movement, we\u2019ve created an alternative economy with people donating their time and talents to sharing the swim love. People call us \u2018the most magic club in the world\u2019 and the \u2018nicest place on the internet\u2019. I love swimming for the same reasons I always did, but now I have a whole community to love around it \u2013 if you haven\u2019t already, jump in and join us. Lucozade Sport 28/50 Katee Hui, Football (London) Katee Hui was a keen footballer in Hamilton, Canada, but when she moved to East London, she could not find enough opportunities for females to play. So, she started her own and founded Hackney Laces community club in 2011. It now runs as a social franchise in three London boroughs. In addition to providing football to hundreds of girls and women, there's an \u201coff the pitch\u201d programme designed to inspire and support participants beyond football. \u201cFootball empowers people, builds friendships and boosts physical and mental health so I thought it was important to create a place woman can play. The Laces has become more than a club, it\u2019s a family, a community, a place to go and belong.\u201d Lucozade Sport 29/50 Keith Whitton, Rink Hockey (Doncaster) Keith Whitton travels dozens of miles a week to inspire newcomers to try the sport he has loved for over 50 years, Rink Hockey.

I firmly believe that Rink Hockey has always given me good health and fitness as well as a real sense of belonging.\u201d Lucozade Sport 30/50 Khadijah Safari, Martial Arts (Milton Keynes) After failing to find a martial art class she could take without wearing her hijab, Khadijah Safari quit her job as a graphic designer and set up London\u2019s first women-only martial arts club, Safari Kickboxing. It is a safe space for Muslim and non-Muslim women to mix, train together in self-defence and keep fit. \u201cThe first class was packed out with one of the women travelling a six-hour round trip just to be there. It was clear from the start that the women really needed this. We created a safe, empowering environment where women can feel strong and powerful.\u201d Lucozade Sport 31/50 Lauren Gregory, Running (Leamington Spa) Lauren Gregory founded Run Like A Girl after gaining confidence from a charity ultramarathon which she took part in. What started as a social media post to local mums has now grown into a running club with over 3,000 throughout Warwickshire and Australia. \u201cWhen 300 women turned up one evening, we caused town gridlock and realised we were on to something. The aim is that women, mums especially, can get a bit of valuable \u2018me time' to exercise and socialise.\u201d Lucozade Sport 32/50 Leanne Davies, Running (Leatherhead) After a second baby, Leanne Davies struggled to keep to fixed commitments or structured running club times. Frustrated by this, she set up a small Facebook Group of three women that steadily grew in popularity with members joining from all over the U.K. Six years later Run Mummy Run has reached over 62,000 members. \u201cMy life feels incredibly manic at times; I have two young boys, a busy household and Run Mummy Run, which has grown into a full-time job. Juggling all of that can be quite intense so having the ability to shut the door behind me, head to the trails and find some calm and perspective really helps me find that balance in life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 33/50 Leanne Pero, Dance (London) Movement Factory is the vision of Leanne Pero who, in 2001 at the age of 15, set out to create lasting community impact and change through her love of dance. Its mission is positive empowerment, personal development and a fun creative outlet for improving health. Over 500,000 young people have been inspired to move thanks to the Movement Factory. \u201cRealising how dance had benefitted me at an early age was enough to start my own company when I was 15. For us, it is not about how well you can dance, but that you and your community are coming together to do it.\u201d Lucozade Sport 34/50 Linda Hesselden, Ballet (Plymouth) Inspired by assisting her mother in her dance school in the 1970s, Linda Hesselden became a member of the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD).

Silver Swans is a RAD initiative which enables students aged 55 and over to learn ballet. \u201cDance has a special effect on those who do it for the first time, regardless of age.

In the 2017 World Winter Games, she was selected as Team GB head coach for the Special Olympics following her work with para-skate star, Meg McFarlane. \u201cSkating is such a sociable activity that really helps build confidence and enables friends and family to move and feel supportive of each other too. People can be put off by the thought of it being too difficult as it can be technically more demanding than other sports, but part of the sense of achievement comes from mastering the skates and using it as an escape from everyday life.\u201d Lucozade Sport 36/50 Mac Ferrari, Cycling (London) Founder of Bikestormz and the unofficial godfather to the U.K. #BikeLifeMovement, former gang member Mac Ferrari has encouraged thousands to take part in mass ride-outs and promotes the message of \u201cBikes Up, Knives Down\u201d. \u201cBikestormz started because I saw groups of kids across London who were into bikes but didn\u2019t know of each other. We found a way of bringing them together to be actively engaged in a good cause whilst showcasing their talents.\u201d Lucozade Sport 37/50 Melanie Timberlake, Martial Arts (Aylesbury) Melanie Timberlake has shown phenomenal resilience to overcome post-natal depression and brain surgery to inspire others through a shared love of sport.

I\u2019m now a manager of his team and coach more than 60 kids a week. I believe that anybody can do any sport, it\u2019s just down to how it\u2019s taught and treating people like people.\u201d Lucozade Sport 38/50 Michaella Robb, Paddleboard Yoga (Angus) Michaella Robb is one of the first paddleboard yoga instructors in the U.K. After discovering the sport while travelling, she brought the concept home to Scotland, inspiring others and motivating them to enjoy the sport in the great outdoors. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was into gymnastics and dance, but my love for more extreme sports increased as I got older until I discovered stand up paddleboarding yoga when travelling. I now want to inspire others to discover SUP yoga and get out in nature.\u201d Lucozade Sport 39/50 Oliur Rahman, Community Sports (London) Oliur Rahman started the Active Communities Network to engage young people living in areas of high deprivation to develop an interest and build careers in sport and exercise.

It now has five million registered runners worldwide with over 280,000 people regularly running each week in 1,500 global events. \u201cA parkrun is a social gathering that happens to have a running event as a backdrop. By sticking to our goal from the outset, of being a free event that removes all barriers to movement, we\u2019re also having a positive impact on health and wellbeing and social isolation.\u201d Lucozade Sport 41/50 Phil & Shaun Webb, Ultimate Frisbee (Glasgow) Brothers Phil and Shaun Webb founded Glasgow Ultimate frisbee club and are credited with helping establish and expand the sport throughout Scotland in universities, parks and communities. \u201cWhat we love about Ultimate Frisbee is that it is a fast-paced, dynamic game that keeps you fit. Our motivation to start the club came from a strong desire to provide playing and training opportunities for the local community to train and to make the sport accessible to all.\u201d Lucozade Sport 42/50 Philip Collins, Swimming (London) Philip Collins is the Chair of Out to Swim, an aquatics club for LGBTI+ adults in London, Brighton and Bristol. Founded 27 years ago by a small band of swimmers it is now the biggest LGBTI+ swimming club in the Europe. \u201cThe social element of Out To Swim is one of the main reasons why people join, especially if they\u2019re new to a city. We compete in local, national and international events, both straight and gay, and I still swim two to three times a week. It not only keeps me physically active, but the mental benefits from socialising with friends make it doubly rewarding.\u201d Lucozade Sport 43/50 Sarah Javaid, Cycling (London) Sarah Javaid set up Cycle Sisters to help Muslim women connect and exercise through cycling. It started with her two sisters-in-law and a friend and has grown to over 100 members. \u201cI love that we are normalising cycling for people from different backgrounds and attracting women to cycling who never had a chance to ride before due to cultural reasons or other barriers.\u201d Lucozade Sport 44/50 Shannia Richardson-Gordon, Boxing (London) At only 19, Shannia Richardson Gordon is a coach with Boxing Futures and the Limehouse Boxing Academy. Passionate about how the sport can help others, she travels all over London to teach mental health patients, people with disabilities and young offenders. \u201cI get messages from teenagers all over London who\u2019ve been getting into trouble. I show them that boxing can change their lives. It\u2019s because the discipline influences your all-round lifestyle. It provides structure and builds confidence. That makes the time I spend coaching worthwhile and one day I hope to run my own boxing gym.\u201d Lucozade Sport 45/50 Simon Northcott, Disability Sports (Worchester) Simon Northcott served almost 20 years in the police before taking a post as a teaching assistant in a school working with autistic children after developing complex PTSD. While working as the Disability and Inclusion Lead for Worcester Warriors Rugby Club, he developed a passion for more inclusive forms of sport and invented Hugby where scrums, line-outs and tackling are done by hugging the opponent. He has established initiatives such as Lead the Way, a campaign to ensure vulnerable people feel safe and protected to play and watch sport, and also Tackling Dementia, a weekly event where people with dementia can access sport. \u201cThe impact Hugby is having with those taking part goes beyond just being a novel sport. I have players who talk about how it has helped them to build social networks and restored their self-esteem. We offer Hugby for everyone living in low socioeconomic areas. As a result, I have discovered a job where the rewards provide me with my own occupational therapy\u201d. Lucozade Sport 46/50 Skye Stewart, Football (Wolverhampton) Skye Stewart founded Black Country Fusion FC, the first LGBTI+ inclusive team to enter a non-gay league in the West Midlands. The open-minded football club has gone on to establish a female team and a veteran\u2019s team for men over 35. \u201cI\u2019m part of something that\u2019s genuinely inspiring people who once shared my reluctance for sport, but now get into football and other activities. To get more active you often need to overcome mental as well as physical barriers too, but when you do, the rewards are massive.\u201d Lucozade Sport 47/50 Sophia Warner, Sprinting (Ockley) Born with cerebral palsy, Sophia fought the odds and became a Paralympic track and field athlete. Inspired by her experiences, Sophia founded the Superhero Series in 2016, for disabled people to take part in sport alongside their friends and families. \u201cI know first-hand what a hugely positive impact sport can have on a person\u2019s life. I\u2019ve learnt along the way that the biggest barrier to people with disabilities taking part in sport is the lack of confidence. I set up the Superhero Series to give people with any type of disability, visible or invisible, the confidence and opportunity to move, engage and enjoy sport as I have.\u201d Lucozade Sport 48/50 Tanayah Sam, Cricket (Birmingham) Ex-convict Tanayah Sam works with young people in schools and prisons at risk of joining gang culture to find a path through life using sport. His 12-week programme uses cricket to encourage social cohesion and steer young people away from crime and anti-social behaviour. \u201cWhen I was in jail, I noticed how the only place that never got trashed was the gym. I helped set up a sports academy doing football, cricket, and basketball and bringing in coaches who acted as mentors too. Sports is great, it can help tackle low self-esteem, depression, obesity and also be a tool for mediation and diffuse conflicts.\u201d Lucozade Sport 49/50 Wendy Rumble, Running (Maidenhead) Living an active lifestyle can be challenging when you are a new parent. Wendy Rumble leads a buggy running movement with an educational website, online community and a running club, Buggy Squad, to inspire parents and families to find the freedom to exercise. \u201cWhen my children came along I got a buggy designed for running and set about letting other people know about all the benefits of buggy running. I have met with the Prime Minister, Minister for Sport and English Athletics to talk about the health benefits and freedom it brings to so many new parents.\u201d Lucozade Sport 50/50 Wendy Russell, Hockey (Brighton & Hove) After being diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus, Wendy Russell set up the first deaf hockey session in the country at Brighton and Hove Hockey Club. She worked with Remark to develop 40 new sign language signs for hearing-impaired players of all ages, which has now been rolled out by UK Deaf Sport and England Hockey to make hockey accessible to hearing impaired and deaf people across the whole of the country, and she is also a UK Coaching Ambassador. \u201cWhen I was coaching two girls whose parents are deaf, I became aware of the lack of provision for deaf children to do sports in the area. I wanted to find a way that they could communicate with their team-mates and respond to the umpire. I think that to engage people in sport, you\u2019ve got to be willing to experiment and make it fun first\u201d. Lucozade Sport\n\nLauren believes that a strict \u2018no-one is left at the back on their own\u2019 policy helps reassure new joiners, and the group\u2019s swelling ranks are testament to that. Run Like a Girl has now reached more than 3,000 women and has qualified run leaders running their own groups in Warwick, Coventry, Stratford Upon Avon, London and even Australia - where one former group member who moved there set up her own group because she loved it so much.\n\n\u201cMany of the women who\u2019d never run before are now competing in race distances from 5km right up to ultra marathons,\u201d says Lauren. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing considering some couldn\u2019t manage more than a minute in one go at first. It is great to watch their bodies change and their confidence grow and to be helping them on that journey.\n\n\u201cEvery woman who turns up knows starting to run is not easy. But the encouragement within the group is what makes it so special. There\u2019s no judgment - everyone is there to challenge themselves. For me, seeing people reach their goals is one of my biggest achievements.\u201d\n\nAmong Run Like a Girl\u2019s success stories is Helen Owen, who has run two 10Ks, two half marathons and a marathon relay since joining in 2015. \u201cRunning with a group has given me the belief I can achieve anything if I set my mind to it,\u201d Helen says. \"Lauren helped me see that you have good and bad runs, but it\u2019s the getting back out there that counts. I\u2019ve even encouraged my mum to join the group.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 Lauren was named Amateur Sportswoman of the Year in Coventry and Warwickshire and Best Fitness Instructor. But she\u2019s well aware that the power of Run Like a Girl stretches far beyond the physical.\n\n\u201cWe have our own mental health champions who do a walk and talk to promote being open and sharing any problems with someone else,\u201d says Lauren. \u201cMental health issues are something most of us are touched by in our lives, not helped by the fast paced lifestyle that we all lead. For me personally I know that on the days that I don\u2019t run I don\u2019t feel as well equipped to handle the day.\"\n\nAs the founder of a 3,000-strong running community Lauren is a worthy member of Lucozade Sport\u2019s Movers List which celebrates 50 people who are inspiring communities to live more active lives, and she\u2019s well aware that there is a huge appetite for group running out there. \u201cI know Run Like a Girl has potential to be something really big,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it's a non profit, and I\u2019m juggling it with two children and a full time job as a Personal Fitness Coach. It\u2019s also dependant on my team of running leaders who are all volunteers and give up so much of their free time.\n\n\u201cMy biggest hope is that my love for running will impact others and encourage them to take on their own goals, showing that it is possible to fit running into your life alongside a family and career, gaining personal achievement along the way.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Movers List and to find local facilities and classes to move more, visit www.lucozadesport.com/the-movers-list\n\nFor more information visit runlikeagirl.org.uk and laurengregorypt.com", "description": "For any new mum battling exhaustion, emotional unsteadiness and endless laundry, finding some \u2018me time\u2019 might sound as fanciful as Idris Elba turning up to babysit. But mum-of-two Lauren Gregory is adamant that carving out just 15 minutes to go for a jog can be the difference between a mother coping or falling apart.", "authors": ["Emma Ledger"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/20/j8zegu08.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
