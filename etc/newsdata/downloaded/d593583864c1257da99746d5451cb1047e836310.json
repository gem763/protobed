Max Rose (D-N.Y.) speaks to constituents during a town hall meeting on Wednesday. (Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 It was supposed to be a \u201ccommuting town hall,\u201d with questions and answers about the cost of getting around and out of Staten Island. But Rep. Max Rose dealt with \u201cthe i-word\u201d right away.\n\n\u201cTo some of you, I'm sure all of this seems like the same old nonsense,\u201d said Rose, one of 31 Democrats, and 21 freshman Democrats, whose district was carried by Donald Trump in 2016. He bemoaned Democrats who wanted to impeach Trump \u201cbefore they took the oath of office\u201d and Republicans who'd become \u201cdeaf, dumb, and blind\u201d as the president's legal team flouted subpoenas.\n\n\u201cWhile the president of the United States may be willing to violate the Constitution to get reelected, I will not,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThat's why I intend to fully support this impeachment inquiry and follow these facts where they lead us.\u201d\n\nUntil he spoke those words, Rose had been the only New York City Democrat in Congress who did not support the inquiry. Most of the crowd, more than 100 people packed into a Jewish Community Center, burst into applause. One constituent, holding up printouts from the late Lyndon LaRouche's website, stood up to challenge Rose; he was quickly shouted down. In New York and in other town halls held at the start of this two-week congressional recess, Democrats who have endorsed the impeachment inquiry have encountered more attaboys than jeers \u2014 until they go online, where Republican groups have been portraying swing-district Democrats as hateful and unhinged.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge deal for our country,\u201d Rep. Elissa Slotkin told constituents in East Lansing, Mich., on Wednesday. \u201cThis is only the fourth time in our history that we will go through this. And I do not do it with a light heart. What I would ask everyone, whether you agree or disagree with the decision, is that we treat it with the seriousness that it deserves.\u201d\n\nResistance from Republican constituents has been visible but small. A half-dozen protesters gathered outside of Slotkin's town hall, holding signs with messages like \u201cHe won, get over it.\u201d The crowd was only slightly larger at a protest of Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan, who like Slotkin had flipped a \u201cred\u201d district, albeit one that had been trending away from Republicans. There were some shouts of \u201chearsay\u201d when Rep. Antonio Delgado met constituents in New York; one voter accused him of mouthing Democratic talking points when he said he took no pleasure in the possibility of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe statute makes it pretty clear that it is a crime to solicit anything of value from a foreign national when seeking office or for an electoral purposes,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThat is the letter of the law.\u201d\n\nThe resistance, so far, is a fraction of what Republicans confronted in the summer of 2017, when they were working to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It's quieter than what Democrats faced in 2009, when the ACA was being debated amid false rumors that it would lead to national bankruptcy or \u201cdeath panels\u201d for the elderly.\n\nWhat's unfolding instead is a hardening of partisan attitudes, with Republican voters irritated but not mobilized and Democratic voters showing up with thanks. Staten Island Republicans did not organize around Rose's town hall, and his leading Republican opponent kept her criticism to a tweet. (It used the word \u201csocialism\u201d twice, with a reference to a violinist and socialist activist who is challenging Rose in the 2020 primary.) Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) fielded just two impeachment questions at her Allentown town hall Wednesday; voters, she said, were mostly either thanking her or focusing on other issues.\n\n\u201cSo far in the district, I\u2019ve heard absolutely nothing,\u201d Wild said, when asked whether her constituents are asking about impeachment. \u201cCrickets.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were far more vocal ahead of the Rose town hall, with groups that had worked for Rose in 2018 warning that it would be harder for him to excite them if he wholly rejected impeachment. After the event \u2014 which, as advertised, focused on transportation as soon as the impeachment statement was over \u2014 some said they were surprised that the congressman didn't get a protest.\n\n\u201cI thought there'd be more people angry at him,\u201d said Alan Walters, 73, who had voted for Rose and came to support him Wednesday. \u201cWe live in contentious times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't even want to talk about politics on Facebook because it's so divisive,\u201d said Beverly Walters, 71.\n\nBehind the confident ad buys \u2014 the Republican National Committee was running anti-Rose spots days before he actually endorsed the impeachment inquiry \u2014 polling doesn't suggest a rebellion brewing against swing-state Democrats. A polling memo released Thursday by the National Republican Congressional Committee and designed to rattle Democrats, found that 44 percent of voters in targeted seats, many of them places where Trump had won, nonetheless supported the impeachment inquiry. Public polling has found a surge toward support for an inquiry since a whistleblower first revealed that the president had leaned on Ukraine's president for dirt on the Biden family; nationally, there is far more enthusiasm about impeachment than there ever was for the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton.\n\nWhile Democratic messaging has stuck to the line set by Nancy Pelosi \u2014 focus on the domestic agenda, take no glee \u2014 Republican messaging portrays a country being ripped apart. \u201cRather than spending his time in office accomplishing anything for his constituents, Max Rose would rather waste the next year on another pointless fishing expedition, trying to impeach the president his constituents elected in the 2016 election,\u201d Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House GOP's super PAC, said after Rose's Wednesday night announcement.\n\nBut Rose had talked about impeachment for just seven of the town hall's 68 minutes; he ended it by informing the crowd that he had to talk to the reporters in the room, who were focused on \u201cthe i-word.\u201d Surrounded by cameras, Rose had the most fun answering a question about the GOP's political strategy in Staten Island.\n\n\u201cI am not concerned at all by the NRCC or anyone that wants to try and challenge me because they already tried once, and we kicked their a--,\u201d he told reporters after the town hall. \u201cGuess what? That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen again. They have been absolute jokes. They will continue to be jokes. And I look forward to beating them by an incredible margin.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed reporting from East Lansing, Mich.; Amber Phillips contributed reporting from Allentown, Pa.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cWhite House officials weigh appeal to Democrats in GOP districts to stop impeachment of Trump,\u201d by Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey\n\nA muddled Republican fightback strategy emerges, slower than the speed of Twitter.\n\n\u201cHow to get away with gerrymandering,\u201d by David Daley\n\nRevelations from a conservative group's conference on making more politically friendly maps.\n\n\u201cBiden, in fiery remarks, tells Trump: \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u2019 \u201d by Cleve R.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., on Sunday. (Cheryl Senter/AP)\n\nOn Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders supporters jumped onto a call with campaign manager Faiz Shakir. There was nothing but good news: More than 1 million donors, more than 3 million phone calls, at least 10 million voter contact attempts.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a lot of corporate media who have been trying to deride this campaign, to dismiss this campaign, to write it off and suggest that it was all over,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cThey were writing the obituaries, and, sadly for them, it has not turned out like that.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Sanders had been addressing around 250 voters in Las Vegas, when he asked for a chair, telling the crowd it had been a \u201clong day.\u201d The next morning, the Sanders campaign announced that the senator had gotten medical attention after the event; \u201che was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted.\u201d\n\nThere is not much precedent for what has happened to the Sanders campaign \u2014 it is organizing faster than before in early primary states, but its candidate is off the trail, and an Iowa ad buy has been postponed. Three years ago, Hillary Clinton scrapped some campaign events after a fainting spell resulting from pneumonia, which her campaign had not disclosed until the incident. At the time, Clinton was already the Democratic nominee for president, but the health scare sparked such panic that Donna Brazile, the acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, would later reveal that she considered setting in motion a process to replace Clinton with Joe Biden.\n\nBut just as the Democratic Party's apparatus isn't set up to defend a candidate who's not yet the nominee \u2014 whether it's Joe Biden from the president's attacks or Sanders, who has received well wishes from his competitors all week. (Elizabeth Warren's campaign even sent the Sanders team dinner.) On Thursday, the Sanders campaign announced that the senator would recover in time for the Oct. 15 debate outside Columbus, Ohio. His wife, Jane Sanders, said that he was \u201cup and about\u201d and would soon head home to Burlington, Vt., from Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cYesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone,\u201d Jane Sanders wrote in a statement. \u201cHis doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures.\u201d\n\nApart from the canceled ad buy, and a few events, nothing has changed in the Sanders campaign's strategy this week. Still, that strategy, as laid out in the call, assumes a Democratic primary that is missing most other candidates.\n\n\u201cIf you ask people around the country, what's one thing you know about Bernie Sanders, they're often going to tell you Medicare-for-all or taking on the elite special interests in this country,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cThe other candidate, Joe Biden: What is his argument resting on? When you go around and you ask people, \u201cWhat is one thing you know about Joe Biden,\u201d the answer you often get back is, 'he was the vice president to Barack Obama.' I think as his record gets more exposed \u2014 how he's been favoring trade deals that have hurt the working class, how he supported the Iraq War and has a mythology of how he opposed the Iraq War, how he's been fundraising at the altar of the rich \u2014 I think it is going to be very hard for him to go up against Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nWarren, who has led Sanders in some polls of early states, was not mentioned at all. The conversation about \u201cwhich candidate can beat Donald Trump\u201d was limited to Biden and Sanders. When Sanders returns to the trail, he'll jump right back into an argument about electability, with a new issue \u2014 a brief health scare \u2014 that has historically caused Democrats to panic.\n\nIMPEACHMENT WATCH\n\nThe latest news on the impeachment inquiry:\n\nAD WATCH\n\nTom Steyer, \u201cTogether.\u201d The billionaire is best known among Democrats for his two-year campaign to start impeaching President Trump. He has since stepped away from Need to Impeach, but it's still on the air, including a new buy in Iowa, and Steyer is also on the air reminding Iowans of how he signed up 8 million people on an impeachment petition. \"Millions of voices demanding accountability, making change happen,\" a narrator says. This theme, that Steyer spent big and organized when politicians couldn't win, has run through all of his Iowa advertising; the news cycle gave him a fresh hook.\n\nMichael Bennet, \u201c2010.\u201d The senator from Colorado introduced himself to Iowans as a critic of Medicare-for-all. His new spot accentuates the positive: He was in the Senate to support the Affordable Care Act, was warned that it could cost him his first election (after being appointed to the Senate seat), and backed it anyway. \u201cI didn't win two swing-state elections by apologizing for Obamacare or making empty promises,\u201d he says. Joe Biden has talked less about the risks it took to pass the ACA than about the vision of President Barack Obama; Bennet, by linking himself to the 2010 vote, continues to portray himself as the Democrat who learned something from the Obama-year defeats.\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week.

(Monmouth, 1,161 adults)\n\nProbably did \u2014 43%\n\nProbably did not \u2014 37%\n\nDon\u2019t know \u2014 20%\n\nAs the president continues to recast the Ukraine story as a simple question about corruption \u2014 he has now called for multiple nations to investigate Biden \u2014 his base has followed along faithfully. Thirty-nine percent of voters polled believe that Trump deserves reelection, and a slightly higher number of them believe that the former vice president probably acted wrongly. The question is favorable to Trump\u2019s framing, but the quiet Democratic worry about Biden (or any other Democrat) is that the president can change the discussion around them by throwing as many accusations as Fox News will air.\n\nSouth Carolina Democratic primary (Winthrop, 462 registered voters)\n\nJoe Biden \u2014 37%\n\nElizabeth Warren \u2014 17%\n\nBernie Sanders \u2014 8%\n\nKamala Harris \u2014 7%\n\nPete Buttigieg \u2014 4%\n\nCory Booker \u2014 3%\n\nTom Steyer \u2014 2%\n\nAndrew Yang \u2014 2%\n\nBeto O'Rourke \u2014 2%\n\nTulsi Gabbard \u2014 1%\n\nAmy Klobuchar \u2014 1%\n\nSouth Carolina, the first in a wave of southern states that vote over a few weeks in February and March, is frequently described as Joe Biden's firewall state: If things get sloppy in the first three states, he can recover and build up a delegate lead in places where black voters dominate Democratic primaries. Here, Warren leads Biden among white voters by a 29 to 22 margin; Biden leads the field with black voters, who give him 46 percent of their support to 10 percent for Harris, 9 percent for Warren and 8 percent for Sanders.\n\nCalifornia Democratic primary (PPIC, 1,705 voters)\n\nElizabeth Warren \u2014 23% ( 8)\n\nJoe Biden \u2014 22% ( 11)\n\nBernie Sanders \u2014 21% ( 9)\n\nKamala Harris \u2014 8% (-11)\n\nPete Buttigieg \u2014 6% ( 1)\n\nAndrew Yang \u2014 3% ( 3)\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 2% ( 2)\n\nCory Booker \u2014 2% ( 2)\n\nTom Steyer \u2014 1% ( 1)\n\nAmy Klobuchar \u2014 1% ( 1)\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke \u2014 1% ( 1)\n\nThe California pollster's July survey got a lot of attention for affirming the story line at the time: Joe Biden seems to be taking on water as Kamala Harris surged. Its new numbers add to the teetering pile of bad news for Harris; it's also good for Sanders, who maintains his leads with young voters and Latino voters in the big primary state where he spent the most time. (Sanders's Hail Mary play at the end of the 2016 primary was to win California and move \u201csuperdelegates\u201d away from Hillary Clinton. He lost the state by only seven points.) But the poll was conducted before the Ukraine saga began and long before Sanders's health scare, two story lines that have yet to be reflected in polls.\n\n2020\n\nJoe Biden speaks during a gun safety forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday. (John Locher/AP)\n\nJoe Biden. In nearly every speech, the former vice president tells his crowds that the 2020 election can\u2019t just be about the president. \u201cEverybody knows who Donald Trump is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to tell people who we are.\u201d It\u2019s a way to assuage worries that he, like Hillary Clinton, would chase the president through every twisty news cycle; it\u2019s a way to project confidence that if voters got to hear him and Trump lay out their agendas, Trump would lose badly.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Biden turned a stop in Reno into a response to Trump, rebutting a TV ad that falsely accuses the former vice president of leaning on Ukraine to stop a prosecutor from investigating his son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pressing them to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn\u2019t do his job with someone who, at the time, we hoped would finally crack down on corruption. Trump, on the other hand, was secretly putting at risk our national security to pursue a personal political vendetta against me because he does not want to run against me.\u201d\n\nIt was the third time that Biden had replaced the stump speech with an address about Trump. The first, a June speech in Iowa, embraced the contrast between himself and the president, who was speaking to donors two hours away. The second, an August speech in another part of Iowa, attacked Trump's \u201cvacant-eyed mouthing\u201d of talking points about white supremacy after the mass shooting in El Paso.\n\nA goal shared in each of these speeches was elevating Biden above the other Democratic candidates: He was the one who Trump worried about, and the only one with the stature to respond to him.\n\nBut in Reno, Biden \u2014 who\u2019s often talked about Republicans experiencing an \"epiphany\" once Trump leaves office \u2014 singled out the president\u2019s party for criticism. If that keeps up, it would be a small but vital change to the argument Biden is making\n\nPresident Trump. He spent Thursday in the Villages, a Florida retirement community, ostensibly to promote an executive order that promoted private plans within Medicare Advantage. The event turned into a riff on Medicare-for-all, with the president insisting that Democrats would \u201cdevastate\u201d the health-care system and adding that they were working on their \u201cimpeachment crap\u201d because he kept winning.\n\nCory Booker. He repackaged a suite of plans to \u201ccut child poverty by two thirds,\u201d ahead of a campaign trip to Iowa. They include the Rise Credit, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit; increasing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program maximum by 30 percent; and turning Temporary Assistance for Needy Families into a block grant for states.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke. Starting at the Giffords gun forum in Las Vegas and continuing with a BuzzFeed interview, he accused Pete Buttigieg of curtailing his gun plan because he was afraid of blowback. \u201cHe probably wants to get to the right place, but is afraid of doing the right thing right now,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said onstage. He expanded on those remarks afterward: \u201cI think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll testing and focus-group driving, and triangulating, and listening to consultants before you arrive at a position.\u201d\n\nSteve Bullock. He\u2019s among the Democrats not taking the stage at this weekend's SEIU gathering in Los Angeles; instead, he's spending the weekend in Charleston and Columbia, S.C.\n\nTom Steyer. He plugged $2.7 million more into Need to Impeach, as it goes up in key 2020 states with Senate races, urging Republicans to listen to evidence if impeachment leads to the trial of the president.\n\nTulsi Gabbard. She criticized Kamala Harris for urging Twitter to suspend the president\u2019s account, telling Fox News: \u201cI will stand up for every American\u2019s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... one day until the SEIU's \u201cUnions for All\u201d forums in Los Angeles\n\n... seven days until CNN's LGBT town halls in Los Angeles\n\n... nine days until Louisiana's gubernatorial primary\n\n... 12 days until the fourth Democratic debate", "description": "In this edition: Shrugging about impeachment at Democratic town halls, contemplating a major candidate's\u00a0health scare, and reading the latest polls on the Ukraine saga.", "authors": ["David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/14df289129d597434f083c4e65f5d78a-4432-2955-70-8-6T7DXMHFPQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"}
