The movie was then shown at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn June, Botswana decriminalised homosexuality in a landmark ruling.\n\n'SOCIAL INTOLERANCE'\n\nWalking With Shadows tells the story of protagonist Ebele Njoko, who has remade himself as a successful and respected father and husband named Adrian after abandoning a gay relationship earlier in his life.\n\nWhen the affair is newly exposed, he chooses not to deny it to his wife and others in the face of growing hostility, and his fragile life soon begins to crumble.\n\nThe film's creators include Nigerian TV personality Funmi Iyanda. Her interview with Bisi Alimi, an openly gay Nigerian rights activist, caused a storm.\n\n\"That experience opened my eye to the depth of homophobia and the heightened levels of social intolerance,\" Iyanda, who served as the creative director and a producer on the movie, wrote in a press release.\n\n\"I wanted to find the right story to tell about struggles with one's self and society's expectations in a country which was incredibly vibrant yet deeply and punitively conservative,\" she added.\n\nIyanda optioned Dibia's book in 2015 and began filming two years later, but struggled throughout to find those willing to fund a movie about such a topic.\n\nLondon-based Irish writer and director Aoife O'Kelly said she was naturally drawn to directing it - her first feature-length film - after growing up in Ireland, where homosexuality was illegal until 1993.\n\n\"I was very empathetic towards the story,\" she told AFP, noting \"the devastation\" the Irish law caused many people who were forced to hide their sexuality and persistently faced arrest or ostracisation.\n\n\"What I hope is that from the story people will gain an understanding of what someone has to go through... (keeping) themselves in hiding most of their lives, and the devastating consequences that will have on not just the person, but their family,\" O'Kelly added.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER HERE:", "description": "A film about the fallout from a romantic relationship between two Nigerian men has premiered in London before a hoped-for but likely controversial release in the west African country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/c55da2395321474fad22f09d2c254aa8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
