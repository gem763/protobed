They teamed on more No. 2 No. 1's - \"Antz\" over \"A Bug's Life\"; Redbox over Netflix and Scrappy over Scooby-Doo, along with a joint tribute to the Los Angeles Clippers, Brooklyn Nets and Chicago White Sox - in a duet that will especially delight list makers.\n\nMooney then stopped the song with this rhyme: \"I like Hanukkahs more than Christmases/I don't like islands but I love isthmuses.\"\n\n\"What's an isthmus?\" Chance asked.\n\n\"It's a narrow strip of land connecting two bigger pieces of land,\" Mooney explained correctly.\n\n\"And that's the second-best to islands?\" an unconvinced Chance asked.\n\n\"For the purposes of this song, yes,\" Mooney said.\n\nNew addition: Chance the Rapper welcomes new baby girl; wife Kirsten shares first photo\n\nChance and Kyle with the hot takes \ud83d\udd25#ChanceOnSNLpic.twitter.com/VUNBamKGoM \u2014 Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) October 27, 2019\n\nThey added a few more \u2014 The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf over Starbucks; \"Angel\" over \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" \u2014 before Chance, after dismissing Mooney's request to be on his next album, brought the song home with a rousing ending:\n\n\"Yeah, I'm the kind of guy that likes the second-best best/I think Chicago is better than the rest.\n\nI take seconds at dinner/And second glances/I believe in second chances.\n\nI love my wife and my family is true/A month ago we welcomed daughter No. 2.\n\nNow, I'm in New York/It's great to be alive/I'm back for the second time hosting 'Saturday Night Live.'\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/27/snl-host-chance-rapper-opens-song-honoring-second-bests/2477723001/", "description": "Chance the Rapper opened his 'Saturday Night Live' hosting gig by honoring his native Chicago - The Second City - with a song praising 'second bests.'", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published A.M.
