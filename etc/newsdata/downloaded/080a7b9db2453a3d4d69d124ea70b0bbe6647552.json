Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Pelosi and Schumer take hard line with Trump on gun background checks\n\nDemocratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer warned President Donald Trump on Sunday that any firearm legislation that falls short of universal background checks for gun sales \u201cwill not get the job done,\u201d complicating delicate negotiations between the president and a group of senators.\n\nTrump has been discussing potential legislation with senators in both parties that would expand background checks but would not go as far as House-passed legislation that would apply them to all gun sales with limited exceptions. Trump issued a veto threat on the House\u2019s background-checks bill earlier this year, and few Republicans in Congress support it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in a conversation with Trump on Sunday morning, the House speaker and Senate minority leader indicated to Trump that they were taking a much harder line than rank-and-file senators involved in the talks.\n\n\u201cThis morning, we made it clear to the president that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done, as dangerous loopholes will still exist and people who shouldn\u2019t have guns will still have access,\u201d Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement.\n\nThe two leaders said they promised to join Trump \u201cfor a historic signing ceremony at the Rose Garden\u201d if the president would endorse the legislation and lean on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to pass it \u201cto save as many lives as possible.\u201d\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). The GOP has typically opposed such a proposal, but several Senate Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Braun of Indiana, have expressed interest in those talks.\n\nTrump remains the key, and he has kept senators in anticipation now for weeks. Murphy says he thinks Trump may see a political upside to cutting a deal.\n\n\u201cHe clearly understands the politics of background checks,\u201d Murphy said in an interview on Friday. \u201cHis political antenna is pretty sharp, at least on the issue of background checks and how popular they are.\u201d\n\nIt will be a challenge to rally Democrats in support of a background-checks bill that falls short of universal checks, particularly given the left-leaning nature of the presidential primary and discussion of ideas like buybacks of assault weapons and gun licensing.\n\nBut Murphy seemed optimistic about building on Manchin and Toomey\u2019s bill from 2013. \u201cManchin-Toomey has to be the framework. \u2026 I don\u2019t think you can get Democratic votes for something that\u2019s fundamentally less than Manchin-Toomey,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nPelosi and Schumer are pushing for far more, which Republicans say they are unwilling to accept. Toomey has specifically called out Schumer and Pelosi as unhelpful in their rhetoric on background checks, and a number of GOP senators involved in the talks suggested that some Democrats would rather clobber Republicans over the issue in next year\u2019s election than cut a deal with Trump.\n\n\u201cI focus more on Murphy because he\u2019s more liberal and you might think he wouldn\u2019t be willing to compromise for the sake of retaining the political issue. Because that\u2019s where some people are on this issue,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said. \u201cThat\u2019s not his approach.\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump is still deliberating about what he will include in a firearms package that congressional Republicans are anxiously anticipating.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/18/e15cda504cc7b8defa25ee1ba6ec/190915-pelosi-schumer-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
