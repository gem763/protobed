That\u2019s the second-worst performance in Asia, with almost all the declines occurring in August. Stocks and bonds had a more muted quarter, with the dropping 1.7% and the yield on 10-year government debt dropped moderately.\n\nTrading was relatively quiet on Monday before the extended holiday even as the Trump administration was said to consider restricting U.S. investors\u2019 exposure to China. Risks next month include a fresh round of trade talks, while China\u2019s central bank could disappoint traders counting on additional policies to support economic growth. Beijing was seen as ensuring stability before China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cI have never flipped my yuan view so many times in such a short period of time -- every day seems to be different,\u201d said Stephen Innes, a market strategist for Asia Pacific at AxiTrader Ltd. \u201cThe lack of Chinese easing continues to weigh on regional growth and equity sentiment, which is hardly providing an inspiring backdrop to own yuan.\u201d\n\nYields on China\u2019s 10-year notes have dropped eight basis points this quarter, versus 32 basis points for comparable U.S. Treasuries as the People\u2019s Bank of China refrained from using intense monetary easing like a policy-rate cut to bolster the slowing economy. This year\u2019s range for the benchmark rates -- at about 45 basis points -- is set to be the narrowest in seven years.\n\nAnalysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg predict 10-year yields will end 2019 at 3% versus Monday\u2019s 3.15%. Russell last week said it will hold off on including the country\u2019s debt in its flagship World Government Bond Index.\n\nDiverging Stocks\n\nThe slipped this quarter as traders waded through a spate of profit warnings and more tariff threats from the U.S. The small-cap ChiNext bounced 8.1% as of midday Monday to erase much of the second quarter\u2019s 11% pullback, helped by a return of risk appetite.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story for Hong Kong\u2019s , which is poised to hand investors some of the world\u2019s worst returns this quarter. Reeling from a tumbling yuan and the trade war, months of often-violent street protests have added pressure on earnings for some of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest companies. The index is down 8.6% for the quarter.\n\nThere are hopes the fourth quarter will be brighter for both stock markets. Analysts and fund managers predict the HSI will rise to 28,000 points at year-end, 7.9% above Friday\u2019s close. In that time the is seen gaining 5.7%.\n\nChina\u2019s onshore markets -- as well as its stock-trading links with Hong Kong -- will be shut for five trading days from Oct. 1. China\u2019s biannual extended holidays have recently proven to be a vulnerability for mainland traders, who have had to wait to react to market-moving news. That\u2019s a risk some will chose to not take this time, with many seen clearing out positions on Monday.", "description": "Yuan Set for Worst Quarter in a Year as Stocks, Bonds Muted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic382c6dc5a323a2263862182b3f703e3c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
