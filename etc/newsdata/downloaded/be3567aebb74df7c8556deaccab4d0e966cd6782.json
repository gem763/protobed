A year ago, finance executives from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink to JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon stayed away from the Future Investment Initiative, Saudi Arabia\u2019s annual money junket, following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul by the kingdom\u2019s agents. The calculus on whether to attend the so-called \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d looks different 12 months on.\n\nThree weeks ahead of the conference it appears that Fink will be there, as will HSBC\u2019s interim boss Noel Quinn. Of the other leading banks recently selected to coordinate Saudi Aramco\u2019s stock market debut, Credit Suisse\u2019s Tidjane Thiam and Citigroup\u2019s Mike Corbat may travel, while Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are also yet to confirm. Dimon and Goldman Sachs\u2019 David Solomon will probably take last year\u2019s default option of sending lower-ranking bankers in their place.\n\nAt first sight, the latter approach seems logical. HSBC can argue its seven decades on the ground in the kingdom have encompassed other bumps in the road, but overall FII attendance remains controversial. Environmental, social and governance realities require a commitment to human rights, and a United Nations investigator cited credible evidence to probe Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Against that, President Donald Trump clearly isn\u2019t bothered, so the hard-headed business decision is piecemeal attendance.\n\nYet that\u2019s also a bit limp. Contrast it with Fink\u2019s blog post soon after returning from an April trip to Riyadh, in which he argued against operating \u201cunder the radar\u201d in favour of a \u201cpublic dialogue\u201d to press Saudi towards change. In ESG parlance, this would be called a strategy of engagement rather than exclusion. The argument for the former is that it\u2019s more effective to push companies or governments that seem committed to reform to do better from within the tent than just sell their assets to another investor who doesn\u2019t care.\n\nThe weakness of Fink\u2019s argument, as with all engagement strategies, is that they can just be a cynical front for doing nothing. Making it credible requires the BlackRock boss to push Saudi into tangible steps. But at least he\u2019s owning his strategy and dealing with the negative vibes that emanate from it. Banks that send the B-Team to Riyadh shouldn\u2019t kid themselves they are much better.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Who\u2019s off to Riyadh later this month?
