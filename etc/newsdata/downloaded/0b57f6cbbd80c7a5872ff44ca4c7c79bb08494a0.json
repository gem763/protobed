This is oil country!\u201d\n\nThe original mural is a piece by local artist AJA Louden depicting the divisive young climate activist during her notorious \u201chow dare you\" speech delivered at the UN in September.\n\nThe large mural lasted only a few days before it was defaced by counter-protesters with a simple message for the plucky young Swedish saint of sustainability: \u201cThis is oil country.\u201d\n\nA mural of climate activist Greta Thunberg appeared in #yeg after she rallied in Edmonton on Friday\n\nA CBC journalist was filming when two people began spray-painting over the teen's face.\n\nRead more: https://t.co/6NL5N37DQb#yeg#oilsands#yycpic.twitter.com/ifS926TMuy \u2014 CBC Edmonton (@CBCEdmonton) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cMy father has worked in the oil industry. We don\u2019t need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business, support our families, put food on our tables\u2026\u201d the apparent vandal told a CBC journalist who happened to be on site at the time.\n\nJust shut up until you have solutions.\n\n\"It is absolutely intolerant of them [climate activists] to tell us how to change our lives and our people. She should go back to her country and try to make her country better,\" they added.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, a second man added a French slur to the mural later that same day.\n\nNew Greta Thunberg mural in Edmonton, Canada painted Friday for her visit, defaced by Saturday & obliterated by Sunday.\n\n\n\nArtist: \"Nothing lasts forever.
