Just wondering why the f**k you\u2019ve been wearing this for eight years,' laughed another user.\n\n'Did you get that at Liberace's yard sale,' one person questioned.\n\n'It's like if Las Vegas was a ring,' said another.\n\nOthers simply dissed it as 'fugly', while some compared the unique shape to everything from a 'butt plug' to a 'penis' to 'ovaries'. Another commented: 'Why are you wearing a fountain on your finger???'\n\nDazzling: Social media users dragged the owner for the ring which they deemed 'Las Vegas tacky' and like 'tinfoil'\n\nThe original poster was also told that she was among the top contenders for 'ugliest ring ever shared' in the group.\n\n'This is literally the ugliest f*****g ring I\u2019ve ever seen,' one person wrote.\n\nAwkward: The ring's owner confessed that she has ripped plenty of gloves on the bauble\n\n'I think we\u2019ve done it guys, we\u2019ve seen the worst ring ever made. We can archive the group.'\n\nDespite knowing that her jewelry was going to be slammed by the silver-tongued users in the Facebook group, the original poster did take the time to defend elements of her sentimental jewelry.\n\n'I doubt anyone cares, but the setting was purchased on eBay from China while my husband and I were both in college with two young kids on a tight budget,' she wrote.\n\n'The center stone (originally a solitaire) \ufffcI bought ... when I was single/gift to myself after a bad divorce.\n\n'The jeweler that set the two together told us it was a shame a nice stone was going into such a cheap settling.\n\n'It's a tall boy and I rip a lot of gloves at work,' she added. 'It surprisingly doesn't get caught on anything, besides gloves.'\n\nWith over 200 comments running the gamut from amused to disgusted, there were some rather hilarious comparisons in the mix.\n\nHaters gon' hate: The ring attracted major trolling in the private group, which has 25,000 members\n\n'Was the inspiration for this the Caesar palace fountain,' asked one person.\n\n'Is the side view supposed to look like an upside down uterus and ovaries,' demanded another.\n\n'For when you want to put some extra bling and sting into that backhanded pimp slap,' one woman speculated.\n\nOne person added: 'Why do you have a WWE belt on your f**king finger?'\n\nThe ring was also likened to a Transformer, Tinfoil, a Superbowl ring, and a 'Christmas ornament from the 1990s'.\n\n'I'd call it a horcrux but Voldemort has better taste than this,' concluded one woman.\n\nThankfully, the woman who shared the ring in the group got plenty of laughs from the reactions, later updating her post to say: 'Glad you guys enjoyed it! My husband and I had lots of laughs!'", "description": "A woman got more than she bargained for after posting pictures of her colossal rock to a notorious ring shaming group on Facebook.
