The Quebec-built jet, formerly known as the Bombardier C Series, was the subject of a heated US-Canadian trade dispute in 2017.\n\nIn April of that year, Boeing filed a complaint with US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission alleging that Delta\u2019s 2016 order for C Series jets was made possible only by abnormally low prices supported by Canadian government subsidies.\n\nRead more: Delta is the first US airline to fly the new Airbus A220 jetliner. Here are its coolest features.\n\nThe US International Trade Commission agreed and in September of that year recommended a 219.63% tariff. A week later, the Commerce Department added a 79.82% tariff.\n\nBombardier and Delta both argued that Boeing\u2019s business couldn\u2019t have been hurt by the deal because Boeing didn\u2019t have a product in its lineup similar in capacity to the C Series.\n\nIn total, Bombardier and Delta faced a 299.45% tariff on any Canadian-built C Series plane exported to the US.\n\nFacing the possibility of losing the most important order in the C Series program\u2019s history, Bombardier turned to Boeing\u2019s greatest foe, Airbus.\n\nLess than a month after the tariff was announced,Bombardier handed 50.01% of its prized airliner program to Airbus with zero up-front cash investment coming from the European aviation giant.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, the Bombardier C Series was officially rebranded as the Airbus A220.\n\nEven though the A220 entered service with Swiss in 2016, it didn\u2019t commence commercial flights in the US until earlier this year. Business Insider had the chance to check out the state-of-the-art carbon composite jetliner when Delta launched its inaugural A220 flights in February. We experienced the aircraft\u2019s first and economy class cabins on a round trip between New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport and Boston Logan Airport. Unfortunately, those flights only lasted about an hour. Since the A220\u2019s extraordinary range and fuel efficiency allows it to operate flights as long as six or seven hours, we wanted to see what it was like on one of these longer journeys.\n\nHence our decision to fly a Delta Airbus A220 from LaGuardia to Dallas Ft. Worth International Airport, a flight that should take around four hours.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nArrived at LaGuardia Airport\u2019s Terminal C at 11:20 am, one hour and 40 minutes ahead of my 1 pm flight. The terminal was not terribly busy on a Thursday afternoon. I was able to check my suitcase and go through the TSA PreCheck security line in less than 15 minutes.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nI stopped to grab a bottle of water and a snack before making my way to Gate C18. We were expected to board at 12:20 pm.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nHowever, our flight wound up being delayed by more than an hour and a half to 2:33 pm. The delay also necessitated a gate change to Terminal D which required a trek through the walkway connecting the two facilities.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nFrom the walkway, I could see our plane on the tarmac.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nHere\u2019s our plane pulling into the gate.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThis is the Airbus A220-100 that operated our flight is N110DU. It was delivered brand new on March 29, 2019 and was the ninth A220 to enter the Delta fleet.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nFinally, at around 2:20 pm, we boarded the flight.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAt the boarding door, there were a couple of remnants of its Bombardier past including this information car and\u2026\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 A C Series welcome mat.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThe Airbus A220 features five seats per row in 3-2 configuration. Delta\u2019s A220-100s have a total of 109 seats on board with 12 in First Class, 15 in Comfort Plus, and 82 in Main Cabin or economy.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nEconomy class seats have 30 to 32 inches of seat pitch, the amount of space between two rows of seats.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThe A220 also boasts remarkably large overhead storage bins that look like something you\u2019d find on a wide-body jumbo.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nHere\u2019s my seat,16E.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nDelta\u2019s A220s boasts some of the roomiest economy-class seats in the business at 18.6 inches wide. That\u2019s roughly two inches wider than the seats on some of Delta\u2019s MD-88s.\n\nSeat 16E has more legroom than any other seat on the plane. That\u2019s because it\u2019s in an emergency exit row and missing the seat in front of it. You can really stretch out in this seat.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nHere come our checked bags! Unfortunately, our flight had been delayed once again. The pilots announce over the intercom that the mechanics are attempting to fix a valve of some sort.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nIn the meantime, I admire the Delta Embraer E-Jet parked one gate over.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nI miss these old Ford Rangers.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nTo pass the time, I decide to check out Delta\u2019s in-flight entertainment system. Seat 16E uses a screen that folds out from the armrest instead of a seat back unit.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nEach screen also boasts a headphone jack and a USB plug. There are power sockets on each row.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThe system offers a good variety of movies, \u2026\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 TV series, \u2026\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 live satellite TV, and\u2026\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 music options.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThere\u2019s also information on the flight.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAs well as a map that will simulate the flight route.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAn hour and a half after boarding our flight we are still at the gate. The Embraer has departed and an Airbus A320 is now occupying the nearby gate. With that said, the Delta crew remained in communication during the delay with frequent updates on the maintenance situation.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nWe have pushback! Finally, we leave the gate a few minutes before 4:00 pm. Three hours after our original departure time.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAs we taxi to the runway, we pass a Bombardier regional jet. Delta still operates CRJ900 regional jets on flights between New York and Dallas.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nWelcome to New York!\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nTime for takeoff!\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThe A220\u2019s pair of Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines quickly spooled up and off we went. The GTF engines proved to be remarkably quiet, even at full throttle.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nWe got a great view of Lower Manhattan as we turned south.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAs we climbed through the clouds, the grey was replaced by blue skies and fluffy clouds.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAccording to our schedule, the flight should take around 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAfter takeoff, I turn my attention back to the entertainment screen. I settle in to watch the film \u201cVice.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAlas, the system glitched and would not allow me to watch beyond the first few minutes.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nSo. \u201cAquaman\u201d it is.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nHalf an hour or so into the flight, the crew commenced food and drinks service. The IFE screen also features a built-in menu of available food and drink.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nSeat 16E also get a special fold-out tray table that\u2019s stored in the right armrest.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nI went for a diet coke.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nI also purchased a snack box which included cheese, crackers, salami, and cookies. Not the healthiest thing under the sun, but it was good.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nDuring our flight, the cabin was bathed in blue mood lighting.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nAfter the drinks service concluded, I walked around the cabin to stretch my legs. I stopped by the Captain\u2019s side bathroom at the back of the plane. It\u2019s one of the few aeroplane lavatories with a window. The A220\u2019s other two bathrooms do not have windows.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nWe landed in Dallas at around 7:30 pm local time.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nHere\u2019s one final look at the Delta Airbus A220 at DFW Airport. Overall, we were impressed by the wide economy class seats, quiet cabin, plentiful overhead storage space, and broad in-flight entertainment options. I\u2019m usually not a big fan of long flights on narrow-body airliners. They tend to feel cramped and uncomfortable. The A220 didn\u2019t feel that way. I look forward to my next flight on the Airbus A220.\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
