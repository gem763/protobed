It is cheap, versatile, lightweight, and has many benefits like maintaining food quality and safety and preventing waste,\" he said.\n\nHowever, \"discarded plastics endanger our marine wildlife, and have begun to enter the food chain. There is an urgent need for developing technologies to recover plastic waste.\"", "description": "Australian scientists have designed a system which uses microwaves to decompose plastic into an environmentally friendly by-product.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/18/5da959eea310cf3e97a1e85a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
