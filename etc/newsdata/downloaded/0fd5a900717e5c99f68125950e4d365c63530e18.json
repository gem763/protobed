Athletics tracks tend to be quiet places at this time of year and, while almost everyone in her training group has already ended their season, the late World Championships in Doha mean she must keep plugging away for a few weeks longer.\n\nThe absence of her training partners should have little impact, though. As the sole athlete of world-class standard in the group, Thiam does much of her training alone anyway \u2013 certainly when it comes to running, where the men tend to be too quick and the women too slow.\n\nAside from Thiam, the Olympic, world and European heptathlon champion, the only other senior international is one whose most notable achievement is representing Luxembourg at the Games of the Small States of Europe. It is quite a gulf.\n\nA toddler who has been unsteadily running up and down the home straight takes an inevitable tumble and starts crying; Thiam, 25, offers a friendly greeting to one of the elderly volunteer coaches; the sun continues to shine; everything is relaxed.\n\nThis has been Thiam\u2019s home track ever since she began making the routine hour-long train journey after school from her mother\u2019s house in Namur to Liege and back when she was 14. Four days a week she would complete her schoolwork on the train home before arriving to her dinner plate left on the table. \u201cIf you want something, you have to work or it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she says of the arduous schedule.\n\nThe signs of future success were always there. Her sinewy 6ft 2in physique lends itself to the heptathlon and after climbing the junior ranks with a smattering of medals, her star now shines far beyond small Belgian towns.\n\nNafi Thiam looks close to unbeatable in the heptathlon Credit: Paul Grover More\n\nIt is difficult to know what is most impressive: the global titles, the unbeaten streak dating back to May 2016, or the fact that only two women \u2013 Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Carolina Kluft \u2013 have points tallies in history higher than her.\n\nAs much as Britain\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson is improving each year, there remains an enormous 200 points between their respective personal bests. That Johnson-Thompson is expected to win world silver in Doha next week shows just how far ahead Thiam really is.\n\nWith each year and every accomplishment, her fame grows bigger in Belgium. There is a giant poster of Thiam\u2019s face at the entrance to her home track and she was given headline status at the Brussels Diamond League earlier this month, leading a procession of international athletes driven round the track in open-top cars. It is a crown that sits uncomfortably on someone who describes themselves as naturally shy.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m in an environment I don\u2019t know, with people I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll just observe. That\u2019s just the way I am,\u201d she says, in flawless English. \u201cBut you get used to things. You just learn to do the job \u2013 it\u2019s part of it. There are still some things I don\u2019t really like. But that\u2019s like everything, you have good sides and bad sides.\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s in the athletics circle I\u2019m comfortable with it. It\u2019s when it goes to the personal side that it\u2019s maybe sometimes a bit uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cWhen I do my groceries or I\u2019m at a restaurant and people take pictures that isn\u2019t very cool because you don\u2019t feel very comfortable and feel like people are watching you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to that. But most people are really nice and supportive. I still have a normal life and I don\u2019t have to hide or anything. I wouldn\u2019t like it to get bigger. A little celebrity is enough.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Naimette-Xhovement track in Liege is all but deserted when Nafi Thiam arrives on a balmy September afternoon.
