We need more time,\u201d Rinne told a news conference after talks with the incoming president of the European council, Charles Michel, in Helsinki.\n\nThe issue of customs checks on the island of Ireland and the details of a mechanism for providing democratic consent to arrangements for avoiding a hard border have dogged negotiations in Brussels.\n\nOn Sunday night, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was still \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d after slow progress over the weekend.\n\nEU sources suggested there was more cause for hope after talks between the negotiating teams on Monday, in a sign that the UK government might be preparing to make yet another concession. \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic,\u201d said one diplomatic source.\n\nBut such is the complexity of the customs arrangements being discussed and the sensitivity of the issue of consent that EU officials have long doubted a legal text could be ready for leaders to approve when they meet at the summit. The EU has insisted the heads of state and government will not negotiate during their two-day meeting in Brussels.\n\nIn Luxembourg on Monday, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, appeared to concede that the talks could eat into next week, raising the chances of a Brexit extension being required.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to say, even though we\u2019re only a few days away from the summit. It\u2019s too early to say whether it\u2019s possible to get a breakthrough this week or whether it will move into next week.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re attempting to do here is to write a legal text for an international treaty \u2013 that is, a withdrawal agreement. That means it\u2019s got to be watertight, it\u2019s got to stand up to full scrutiny and legal challenge potentially, and what they\u2019re trying to do is complicated.\u201d\n\nThe EU has rejected the UK\u2019s proposal of a dual customs system at Northern Ireland\u2019s ports and airport that would involve tracking the destination of all goods entering from Great Britain and applying differential treatment depending on their final destination.\n\nBarnier has pushed the UK to accept a model closer to a Northern Ireland-only backstop with Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s single market for goods. It would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would be enforced in the Irish Sea, a move that risks provoking the Democratic Unionist party.\n\nCoveney said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to put in place an arrangement that is Northern Ireland-specific, that protects UK interests and EU interests, in a way that\u2019s quite complex. So we need to give negotiating teams space to do that. I think there is goodwill and a political determination to get this done. It is being left very late in the day but we shouldn\u2019t write off this summit as a potential opportunity for agreement.\u201d\n\nShould Johnson fail to find an agreement by Saturday he will be forced by the Benn act to request an extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU.\n\nThe issue of an extension was raised for the first time in months in a meeting between Barnier and ambassadors representing the EU27 on Sunday. Sources said there appeared to be two options: a short \u201ctechnical extension\u201d if a deal was on the cusp of being negotiated by the end of October or a longer prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership to accommodate a general election or second referendum.", "description": "Talks continue but agreement of legal text for leaders to approve looks unlikely", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbf34b6583a3714c2a8411625f16b9d6c96b6eab/0_130_4251_2551/master/4251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b98c112adb8768cfd63597b8ae17bb5b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
