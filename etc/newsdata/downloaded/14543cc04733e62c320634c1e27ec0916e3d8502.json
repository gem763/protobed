Pompeo said the withdrawal was to protect them.\n\nTrump, in a tweet on Monday, pledged to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if it does anything he views to be \u201coff limits.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t allayed fears among his own national security leaders, who felt blindsided by the withdrawal, and members of Congress from both parties.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a loyal Trump ally, made a rare break from the president and criticized the withdrawal. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another stalwart supporter of the president, said the withdrawal could lead to the return of ISIS, and released a bill with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) to sanction Turkey for the strikes.\n\nPBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff brought up the remarks from congressional Republicans, but Pompeo rejected the criticism. He argued that the administration had already had success in eradicating religious extremism in the region, including ISIS\u2019 losses in territory in recent years.\n\n\u201cI love Sen. Graham, he is a friend, but remember where we were when this administration came into office and now just judge us by our results,\u201d Pompeo said, repeating the claim that the Trump administration had taken down ISIS.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are a dozen other countries where the threat from radical Islamic terrorism continues to exist, and we, the United States, has to make sure we position our forces, our resources appropriately to reduce that threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nPompeo also touched on Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal, which is at the center of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 a request that has been blasted as asking for foreign interference in a U.S. election \u2014 according to a readout of a phone call between the two leaders in late July.\n\nPompeo characterized the call as a legitimate part of the administration\u2019s effort to eradicate corruption in the former Soviet state.\n\n\u201cI know what this administration has done with respect to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked diligently on this. I\u2019m proud of our results. I remember where Obama left Ukraine; it left it at 80 percent of the size that it was when he came into office.\"\n\nTrump said a similar line during a September bilateral meeting with Zelensky in New York. After Zelensky lamented the loss of Ukrainian territory in the past decade, Trump said: \u201cIf you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration, not during the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nRussia invaded and seized parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014, prompting condemnation from Western countries, including the U.S.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/34/34/c968b58c48e5ad954f09f4ba8a7d/191009-pompeo-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
