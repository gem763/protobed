The development marks the final procedural hurdle before the U.S. can retaliate against European goods, which it plans to do on Oct. 18.\n\nThe EU made a last-ditch appeal to the U.S. over the weekend to thwart the tariffs, seeking a negotiated settlement that would avoid the economic harm a tit-for-tat escalation would cause both parties. European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told her U.S. counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, that his tariff plan would compel the EU to apply countermeasures in a parallel lawsuit over aid the U.S. provided to Boeing Co.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that imposing additional tariffs in the two aircraft cases is not a solution,\u201d Malmstrom said in an Oct. 11 letter to Lighthizer seen by Bloomberg News. \u201cIt would only inflict damage on businesses and put at risk jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\u201d\n\n\u2018Short-Sighted\u2019\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea said at Monday\u2019s meeting in Geneva that the Trump administration\u2019s preference is to \u201cfind a negotiated outcome with the EU that ends all WTO-inconsistent subsidies,\u201d according to a copy of his remarks obtained by Bloomberg. Malmstrom said last month that the EU had reached out to the U.S. with a \u201cdetailed proposal,\u201d but that the U.S. wasn\u2019t willing to negotiate.\n\nThe EU said that it would be \u201cshort-sighted\u201d for the U.S. to impose retaliatory tariffs on European goods and urged the U.S. to find a \u201cfair and balanced solution\u201d to the dispute, according to a statement delivered by Paolo Garzotti, the EU\u2019s deputy head of delegation to the WTO.\n\n\u201cBoth the EU and the US have been found at fault by the WTO dispute settlement system,\u201d Garzotti said. \u201cIn the parallel Boeing case, the EU will in some months equally be granted right to impose additional countermeasures. The mutual imposition of countermeasures, however, would only harm global trade and the broader aviation industry.\u201d\n\nThe EU has already published a preliminary list of U.S. goods -- from ketchup to video-game consoles -- it will target in a $12 billion plan for retaliatory levies related to the Boeing case. The WTO will issue an arbitration award next year.\n\nThe office of the U.S. Trade Representative previously said it would impose a 10% tariff on large civil aircraft from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. The U.S. will also slap 25% levies on a range of other items including Irish and Scotch whiskeys, wine, olives and cheese, as well as certain pork products, butter and yogurt from various European nations.\n\n(Updates with U.S. comment in the fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Jonathan Stearns.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Bryce Baschuk in Geneva at bbaschuk2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Murray at brmurray@bloomberg.net, Richard Bravo, Chris Reiter\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The World Trade Organization on Monday formally authorized the U.S. to impose tariffs on about $7.5 billion worth of European exports annually in retaliation for illegal government aid to Airbus SE.Members approved this month\u2019s arbitration award -- the largest in the trade organization", "authors": ["Bryce Baschuk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BNY1o6lVBAh3JOM9V9Jsag--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f6d52d07461d0755aeffef55d188fc5b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
