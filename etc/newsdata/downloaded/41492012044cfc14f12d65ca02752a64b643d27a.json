Those people who got what they expected used the\n\nselloff to buy, and I think that's what happened here.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.28 points,\n\nor 0.13%, to 27,147.08, the S&P 500 gained 1.03 points,\n\nor 0.03%, to 3,006.73, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped\n\n8.62 points, or 0.11%, to 8,177.39.\n\nThe MSCI world equity index , which tracks\n\nshares in 47 countries, fell 0.06%.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields dipped following Powell's remarks.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price\n\nto yield 1.7909%, from 1.814% late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond\n\nlast rose 23/32 in price to yield 2.2471%, from\n\n2.28% late on Tuesday.\n\nThe dollar strengthened following the Fed's rate cut.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.28%, with the euro\n\ndown 0.36% to $1.1031.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.26% versus the greenback at\n\n108.44 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at\n\n$1.2483, down 0.14% on the day.\n\nOil prices edged lower after Saudi Arabia said it would\n\nquickly restore full production following last week's attack on\n\nits facilities and as U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly\n\nincreased. Tension in the Middle East remained elevated, however. Saudi\n\nArabia on Wednesday displayed remnants of what it described as\n\nIranian drones and cruise missiles used in the attack, calling\n\nthem \"undeniable\" evidence of Iranian aggression. Trump ordered\n\na major increase in sanctions on Iran on Wednesday, following\n\nrepeated U.S. assertions that Iran was behind the attack.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures settled down 2.07% at $58.11 per\n\nbarrel, while Brent crude oil futures settled at $63.60 per\n\nbarrel, a 1.47% decline.\n\nSpot gold reversed early gains after the Fed released its\n\nstatement.
