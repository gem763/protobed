Afterward, the White House said that U.S. forces \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d suggesting that Turkey could be given free rein to strike Kurdish forces long aligned with Washington in the fight against Islamic State.\n\nTrump, in a series of Monday tweets, appeared at first to double down on plans for a U.S. troop drawdown, but later threatened to destroy the economy of NATO ally Turkey if it took its military operation too far. That seemed to be an attempt to placate criticism, including from Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, that he was abandoning the Syrian Kurds, who denounced it as a \u201cstab in the back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCONFUSION AMONG TRUMP AIDES\n\nThe latest presidential pronouncements on Syria injected news confusion over U.S. Syria policy.\n\nLast December, acting without any kind of formal policymaking process, Trump called for a complete U.S. withdrawal from Syria. But he ultimately reversed himself after drawing strong pushback from the Pentagon, including the resignation of then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and an uproar on Capitol Hill and among U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nTrump insisted to reporters on Monday that he \u201cconsulted with everybody\u201d on his new Syria decision, although the announcement seemed to catch Congress as well as some within his administration by surprise.\n\n\u201cHe makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation,\u201d tweeted Brett McGurk, who served as Trump\u2019s envoy for the international coalition to combat Islamic State and quit after the December Syria policy uproar.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt decision on Syria came after learning in the phone call with Erdogan that the Turks planned to go ahead with a long-threatened incursion, a senior administration official said.\n\n\u201cWe were not asked to remove our troops. The president when he learned about the potential Turkish invasion, knowing that we have 50 special operations troops in the region, made the decision to protect those troops\u201d by pulling them back, the official said.\n\nThe official underscored that Trump's decision did not constitute a U.S. withdrawal from Syria.\n\nTrump made clear to Erdogan that the United States did not support the Turkish military plan, which came as a surprise to the Turkish leader, a senior State Department official said.\n\nThere was some confusion among senior officials to figure out what Trump had actually decided, a source familiar with the internal deliberations at the White House said.", "description": "Over the span of just a few hours, U.S. President Donald Trump upended his own policy on Syria with a chaotic series of pronouncements, blindsiding foreign allies, catching senior Republican supporters off guard and sending aides scrambling to control the damage.
