In 2014, the opposition won just three of those races.\n\nFidesz, which had won every major election since 2010, kept up its dominance in smaller cities and towns and, especially, in rural areas.\n\nIn Budapest, however, where Fidesz has long faced more resistance than practically anywhere else in the country, opposition candidate Gergely Karacsony, a former pollster and mayor of a Budapest district, headed to a victory with the backing of five Left-wing, liberal and Green Parties.\n\nWith 90.5 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Karacsony had 50.8 per cent, compared to 44.2 per cent for incumbent Istvan Tarlos, who called to congratulate his rival.\n\n\"The campaign is over, now the work begins,\" Mr Karacsony told supporters and members of his coalition. \"I'd like to put the relationship between Budapest and the government on a new plane. We are readying not for war but for cooperative construction.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Viktor Orban's dominant Right-wing Fidesz party suffered large losses in Sunday's local elections in Hungary.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Michael Hogan", "Jane Shilling"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000212951872-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
