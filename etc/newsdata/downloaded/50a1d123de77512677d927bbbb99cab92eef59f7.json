The Business Times\n\nSingapore\u2019s job seekers have spoken.\n\nAmid global uncertainties, job security has edged out career development to become one of the the most important considerations that affects job seekers\u2019 decisions, according to survey results released by Jobstreet.com on Wednesday (Oct 23).\n\nThe survey of 7,188 job seekers across 20 industries in Singapore found that 11.4 per cent of job security is a top consideration for job seekers. The only two more important considerations were compensation (16.6 per cent) and work-life balance (13.7 per cent).\n\nDeciding factors that were once considered most important in a job offer \u2013 future prospects, employee benefits, management and culture of the organisations \u2013 are now becoming less important, the survey found.\n\nConducted in April and May, the survey also found that Singapore\u2019s job seekers are more concerned about their employability now due to digital disruption and sluggish global growth.\n\nRespondents were also keener on permanent roles across all industries, and about 33 per cent would decline a job offer if its on a part-time or contract basis.\n\nAdditionally, 44 per cent of respondents would prefer to work in an established and financially secure company.\n\nWhile respondents from all generations were concerned about job security, Generation X (12.6 per cent) and baby boomer (12 per cent) job seekers were the most concerned. Generation Y (9.9 per cent) and Generation Z (10.2 per cent) job seekers were comparatively less concerned.\n\nGen Z refers to people aged between 18 and 23 years old, and Gen Y \u2013 otherwise known as millennials \u2013 refers to those that fall under the 24 to 34-year age group. Gen X are between 35 to 54 years old and baby boomers are between the age range of 55 to 64 years old.\n\nWork-life balance still a key driver\n\nRespondents across generations also prioritised work-life balance over job security, JobStreet said.\n\nAccording to the survey, more than half believe that a five-day work week and being entitled to a sufficient number of paid holidays are essential to achieving work-life balance.\n\nOver one in four respondents disliked shift work, and indicated that they would not even consider the offer if irregular hours were a requirement.\n\nWhen it came to leave entitlement, the report found that respondents ideally wanted 18 to 19 days of annual leave. They also preferred to work in disperse-all annual leave distribution models as compared to one that allows leave entitlement to be earned over time.\n\nAs for respondents who held senior management roles in their companies, results showed that 32.7 per cent considered overtime work compensation a \u201cmust\u201d.\n\nIn addition, 29 per cent wanted regular daytime working hours and 19.1 per cent cited a need for flexible working hours. Jobstreet.com\n\nChew Siew Mee, country manager of Jobstreet.com Singapore, said in a statement that senior management members are \u201cthe ones who shoulder heavy job responsibilities and work around the clock\u201d, but this group of employees are \u201cusually exempted from overtime compensation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat this survey has revealed is that companies must make sure to reward employees \u2013 no matter their job positions \u2013 for work done outside of official hours,\u201d she added.\n\nJobstreet also found that job seekers in the education/training and medical/healthcare sectors were also more concerned over work-life balance \u2013 with respondents in these sectors ranking work-life balance as their number one job consideration.\n\nCoincidentally, these are the sectors that are set to expand, with a projected 2.2 per cent growth as shown by statistics from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Jobstreet.com\n\nMoney still talks\n\nUnsurprisingly, employees in Singapore still see attractive salaries as the most important criterion \u2013 with over 16.6 per cent ranking it as their top consideration.\n\nAccording to JobStreet, respondents working in retail and merchandise (26.6 per cent); food and beverage (26.1 per cent); and advertising and media (25.7 per cent) industries have higher expectations for salary increments.\n\nGen Z: Exciting opportunities over money\n\nHowever, salary prioritisation does not translate across all generations. Gen Z respondents are willing to trade salary and compensation for \u201cexciting career development opportunities, modern working environments and companies that are socially responsible\u201d, JobStreet said.\n\nAs compared to the general market, Gen Z respondents were also found to be more responsive towards contract, part-time and project work when looking for a job.\n\nThey are also more eager for overseas employment opportunities and training opportunities, and are drawn towards smart offices with the latest technology.\n\nAccording to Chew, a one-size fits all human resource strategy will no longer work for employers. Hirers must find and embrace the \u201cdifferent behaviours and expectations of every candidate\u201d and derive HR strategies that align with their \u201cdiffering priorities\u201d in order to \u201ckeep talents passionate and engaged\u201d, she said.\n\nJobStreet also said hirers should not overlook basic motivators such as career development opportunities, quality of management and leadership, having respectful and collaborative co-workers and positive work cultures. All these are \u201cfactors that are consistently among the most important that job seekers look out for\u201d, it said.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Local job seekers are more concerned about their employability now due to digital disruption and sluggish global growth, the survey found.\u00a0.
