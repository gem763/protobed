That problem is the premise of a new board game called Hey Robot, which tasks players with getting Alexa or another digital assistant to say a specific word before their opponents can.\n\nThe gameplay works much like Taboo: players are given a selection of words, and they have to figure out what they can ask a smart assistant that will get it to recite the word without saying any form of the word in their question.\n\n\u201cThe game works because the devices don\u2019t work that great,\u201d says Frank Lantz, one of the game\u2019s creators. \u201cIt\u2019s very funny. You think, \u2018Oh this is going to be easy. How hard can this be?\u2019 But that\u2019s the thing. It actually can be very challenging, and it plays with how janky these things are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think these things will continue to have this funny, silly quality for at least the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nLantz is the director of NYU\u2019s Game Center, and he\u2019s known for games including Drop7 and Universal Paperclips. The idea for Hey Robot came from Lantz and his wife Hilary trying to have fun with Alexa during dinner. They started with a number guessing game that they named Alexa Tennis, then eventually moved on to the word guessing mechanic.\n\n\u201cInstantly, we were hooked,\u201d Lantz says. \u201cWe stayed up all night trying to get different words.\u201d\n\nFrank and Hilary, along with their son and daughter-in-law, created and are publishing the game through their company Everybody House Games. A Kickstarter campaign to fund the project launched today, with a funding goal of $10,000. Copies of the game sell for $30 and are expected to ship in March.\n\nHey Robot\u2019s simple premise belies a fascinating commentary on our interactions with technology. The game exists because of emerging tech that\u2019s becoming increasingly ubiquitous, but it also exists because of a common understanding that this tech is, in reality, kind of bad \u2014 often hilariously so.\n\nThe game will also evolve as these assistants do. Lantz says he\u2019s seen answers change just over the six months or so that they\u2019ve been testing the game. If the assistants eventually get good enough to reliably understand what we\u2019re really looking for, the entire challenge of the game breaks down. That could happen within a few years, Lantz admits.\n\n\u201cI doubt it, though. It\u2019s such a genuinely hard problem,\u201d he says. \u201cI think these things will continue to have this funny, silly quality for at least the foreseeable future.\u201d", "description": "Sometimes, it can feel impossible to get what you want from a smart assistant.
