The most famous showdown was over Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal account, which she used in lieu of an official State Department email address during her four years in the Cabinet.\n\nIn a court filing Wednesday night, Justice Department attorneys said the Commerce Department should not be required to conduct a direct search of Ross\u2019 personal email accounts even though searches of Commerce Department accounts found 280 email chains over a 16-month period that contained references to one of more of the four private accounts he used.\n\nMany of the messages pertain to Ross\u2019 travel arrangements through a jet-sharing service, NetJets, and were also sent to government accounts to update Ross\u2019 official calendars, the court submissions say. Other emails involve outsiders, including at least one reporter, who initiated contact with Ross through his private accounts.\n\n\u201cOn multiple occasions, the Secretary\u2026directed the initial email sender to use his official\n\ngovernment email address on future communications regarding agency business,\u201d Commerce attorney Michael Cannon wrote.\n\nThe government lawyers stopped short of saying explicitly that they were certain Ross had complied in every instance with a 2014 law that requires federal employees forward official records contained in private accounts to a government account within 20 days. However, Justice Department attorney Johnny Walker suggested that a search of Ross\u2019 private accounts would not result in the watchdog group receiving any messages not already on Commerce\u2019s system.\n\n\u201cEven if the Secretary did occasionally use a personal email account in connection with agency business, those communications are documented in the files already produced,\u201d Walker wrote.\n\n\u201cAt issue here is whether Commerce must access and search a high-level official\u2019s personal email account for merely duplicative emails. It should not.\u201d\n\nWhile the lawyers seem reluctant to ask Ross to search his private accounts for work-related emails, the lawsuit has already led to one request to the secretary: He was asked for and provided his personal email addresses so that searches for related messages could be conducted in official systems.\n\nAfter Democracy Forward files a response to the government\u2019s submission, U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich \u2014 an appointee of President Donald Trump \u2014 will have to decide whether Commerce has met its legal obligations or is required to do more searching.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that emails a government official keeps on a private server or account are not automatically beyond the reach of FOIA. However, the court did not provide clear guidance on how often or under what circumstances federal agencies would be required to search private accounts.\n\nAsked about the National Archives\u2019 inquiry into Ross\u2019 email practices, a Commerce spokesperson told POLITICO Wednesday that the agency is committed to resolving those concerns.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to engaging and cooperating with the National Archives and Records Administration on their investigation,\u201d said the spokesperson, who asked not to be named.\n\nIn the Post article last month, Ross was quoted as rejecting claims he was defying federal record-keeping laws. \u201cThese hysterical, baseless allegations of illegal activity are without merit,\u201d the Cabinet official said, according to the newspaper.\n\nThrough the FOIA suit, Democracy Forward obtained evidence that Ross used non-government accounts to send or receive official correspondence about interactions with European trade officials, as well as details on meetings with a German carmakers and American billionaire Bill Koch, the Post reported.\n\nNARA\u2019s inquiry is one of dozens it conducts each year to explore reports and complaints that federal records have been waylaid or destroyed due to accidents or deliberate acts.\n\nClinton\u2019s use of a private email account as secretary of State became a central issue in the 2016 presidential election, with many Republicans blasting her practice as an affront to transparency and a danger to national security.\n\nHowever, as many as eight current and former senior Trump administration officials have been reported to use their personal email to conduct official business at least occasionally, including President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serve as senior White House advisers. Ivanka Trump dismissed the reports, saying there was \u201cno equivalency\u201d between her conduct and Clinton\u2019s.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/84/05/4eb5bff449459c2f2f1d4c045488/20191023-wilbur-ross-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
