The International Monetary Fund warns of possible new dangerous downturns.\n\nIt revised downward around a third of one percent the growth projection for 2014, to 2.9 percent.\n\nEurope is not seen as the main source of worry. The IMF focuses on emerging economies that depend on foreign investment, and big budget trouble in the US.\n\nChina is expected to post 7.3 percent, the United States 2.6 percent, Japan 1.2 percent and the euro zone one percent.\n\nHead economist at the IMF Olivier Blanchard, speaking in Washington, tracked current challenges back to 2008: \u201cThe recovery from the crisis continues. I think that is a fact and an important one \u2013 but too slowly. Advanced economies are not out of the woods; public debt, and in some case private debt, remain very high, and fiscal sustainability is not a given. Unemployment remains very high and it will remain high for a very long time.\u201d\n\nIMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde reinforced the \u2018slow\u2019 message: \u201cWe have seen a global crisis and we will be seeing global transitions. We are probably moving from the Great Depression [to] the \u2018Great Transition\u2019. All these transitions, all these massive changes are not going to be fast, are not going to be easy, and the countries will likely spend the rest of the decade adjusting to the new reality.\u201d\n\nReality is just fine for some: Cr\u00e9dit Suisse bank reports record wealth accumulation concentrating in the hands of a few \u2013 a 68 percent increase in overall wealth in the past ten years. This illustrates the scale of imbalances.\n\nThe Swiss themselves top the ranking of per adult wealth, at a nominal average of 380,000 euros each, followed by the Australians, Norwegians and Luxembourgers.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Suisse says two thirds of people in all countries combined make do with just three percent of the world\u2019s wealth: three percent of its wealth sustains the vast majority.\n\nData like this suggest the fortunes of a diamond-tipped minority are growing.\n\nAdrian Lancashire spoke to International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton for his view.\n\neuronews: \u201cFive years ago the financial crisis went global; the rich are still getting richer, the poor getting poorer and the middle is under strain. Isn\u2019t this driving economic recovery and development over a cliff?\u201d\n\nDavid Lipton: \u201cThe most important thing is to get the global economy going again. Advanced economies are recovering and emerging markets, economies, are slowing down, and we are putting our emphasis on trying to help each country, each part of the global economy, get going again. It\u2019s true that income inequality has risen; partly this is because people who are unemployed have a harder time, partly there are ongoing pressures from globalisation and technological change, and the ability of some in the market to make very high profits. But the most important challenge for us is to help countries get going again and also reform the financial systems so that the kind of events that we saw before can never recur.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cIn lots of countries, ordinary people who borrowed more than they could repay are being punished economically, jobs and homes lost, retirement and education. What is IMF policy so the people who led them to over- borrow or who mismanaged risk, are also punished?\u201d\n\nLipton: \u201cI think going forward it\u2019s important that the supervisors, the people that supervise banks, make sure that banks behave in a safer way. The international financial community had a project of financial regulatory reform ongoing for several years. I think it is making a lot of progress. We are not satisfied that everything is in place, but it will be very important that new rules are adopted and followed, so that the problems that brought down the world financial system can not recur.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cIMF policy is to encourage countries to run their economies differently; that\u2019s your condition for helping them. Critics say you\u2019re blackmailing them. What do you say to that?\u201d\n\nLipton: \u201cWell, they don\u2019t have to do businesses with us if they don\u2019t want to. What I think we offer them is something they can\u2019t otherwise have, which is our financial support, and our seal of approval, if they undertake policies aimed at improving their situations. Then they get, in essence, the imprimatur of the entire \u2013 not us as an institution but of the community of our membership \u2013 they get the imprimatur of support from that. I think that the advice that we have given to European countries has been useful during this crisis, and I think that the financial support in conjunction with the financing that has come from Europe itself, has also been very helpful.\u201d", "description": "The guardian of global growth and economic stability has set its sites lower for the coming year in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook.
