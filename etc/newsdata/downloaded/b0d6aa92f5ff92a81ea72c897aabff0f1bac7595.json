Numbers due to be published on Thursday for September will give a further update on the state's housing pipeline.\n\nThe industry welcomed last week's changes that also reduce the advantage for house-and-land packages, which only attract stamp duty on the value of the house, even as off-the-plan purchases have been dutied on the total value of the property.\n\n\"It\u2019s terrific to see the state government encouraging housing diversity by balancing the mix of infill and greenfield development by levelling the policy playing field,\" the Property Council of Australia's WA executive director Sandra Brewer said.\n\nHowever, Mr Wyatt waved off industry concerns that the duty reductions announced for an initial two-year-period last week \u2013 also aimed at boosting the housing density of greater Perth \u2013 would leave developers with a volume of unsold existing stock as buyers opted for units with a lower tax burden.\n\n\"This is a question I put to some of those developers who have existing stock, either under construction or complete,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of those same developers were putting to me that we need this sort of policy. I was curious about that. They seem fairly confident, either because they\u2019ve sold a lot of that stock to have got it built in the first place, or they have other sites they want to develop. They might have some anxiety, but they\u2019re also encouraged by the fact that they can now get on and develop other blocks that they may have.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Wyatt said the policy, which seeks to encourage high-rise development around the Metronet passenger rail expansion program, would also make it easier for local councils to meet the state government's target for increasing density set in 2010.\n\nThe state government has butted heads with some local councils that have resisted higher density, such as Nedlands, which includes Perth's leafy western suburbs such as Dalkeith, Karrakatta and Swanbourne. In January, state planning minister Rita Saffioti intervened to compel Nedlands to update its planning scheme, the ABC reported.\n\nThe new policy would encourage the development of better-quality housing for both first home buyers and downsizers who had been unable to find suitable new dwellings, Mr Wyatt said.", "description": "The state government seeks to boost housing supply before the next mining boom creates affordability problems, says the Treasurer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3575%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_610%2C$y_8/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9dd9d1414b213fe9163d148a65678789f380e7a7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
