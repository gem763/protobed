But not everyone was keen. \u201cIt is incomprehensible and a risky choice for Macron,\u201d said a high-level French official with knowledge of EU issues. \u201cBreton is brilliant, very smart, and has a lot of ideas but he is a man of utmost arrogance, and that ego has harmed him a lot in his career.\"\n\nBut what else do we know about the man who (MEPs permitting) will be France's member of the Ursula von der Leyen Commission?\n\nHe's into sci-fi\n\nBack in 1984, Breton co-wrote a science fiction novel called \"Softwar\" based around the National Software Agency (which in no way resembles the U.S. National Security Agency). Billed as a \"technology thriller,\" the novel's plot is centered on an American cyberattack on Soviet computers. \"At the time no one was speaking about viruses, the word didn't exist,\" Breton said, according to Liberation.\n\nEurope's likely next digital chief is not a fan of email. So much so that in 2011 he said he hadn't sent a single work email in his first three years as CEO of Atos.\n\nHowever, his co-author Denis Beneich later claimed Breton \"never wrote a word of this novel\" although \"he had the idea for it.\"\n\nBreton, whose Commission portfolio would include the space industry, wrote two other novels in the mid to late 1980s \u2014 \"Vatican III\" and \"Netwar\" (all three of his books are worth checking out, if only for the cover art).\n\nHis love of sci-fi doesn't stop with books, however. Breton also helped come up with the idea for a high-tech theme park called \"Futuroscope\" in Chasseneuil-du-Poitou, just north of Poitiers in western France. Its tag-line is \"Expect the unexpected,\" which sounds like good advice ahead of a hearing before the European Parliament.\n\nHe hates email\n\nEurope's likely next digital chief is not a fan of email. So much so that in 2011 he said he hadn't sent a single work email in his first three years as CEO of Atos, one of Europe's largest IT companies. \"If people want to talk to me, they can come and visit me, call or send me a text message,\" he said. \"Emails cannot replace the spoken word.\"\n\nInternal emails are banned at Atos, replaced by instant messaging and a Facebook-style interface. By 2016, email traffic at the company was down 60 percent, according to the Harvard Business Review. Employees who don't send any emails while maintaining productivity are known as \"Zero Heroes\" (no jokes about Eurocrats, please).\n\nEuropean defense fund champion\n\nIn 2016, before Macron began annoying his fellow leaders \u2014 chiefly Angela Merkel and Donald Trump \u2014 with his European defense ambitions, Breton pitched a European defense fund to none other than his potential future boss, Ursula von der Leyen, who at the time was Germany's defense minister. On his blog, Breton wrote that \"Europe has let its guard down at the very time when the need for security and cyber security has never been more pressing.\"\n\nHe wrote that the first goal of his European Security and Defence Fund would be to take on \"all or part of the accumulated debts contracted by the Member States for the purposes of defence since the introduction of the euro.\"\n\nA bunch of MEPs won't scare him\n\nIn July, two men wearing ski-masks and gloves and wielding handguns broke into Breton's Paris home, beat him and locked him up along with his wife and their live-in chauffeur. The thieves made off with a diamond bracelet worth \u20ac50,000 and several hundred euros in cash, according to AFP.", "description": "France\u2019s pick for the next Commission is a sci-fi fan who hates email.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Laura Kayali", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "John Rega"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1169506623-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
