That account was confirmed to POLITICO.\n\nFiona Hill, a former adviser to President Donald Trump on Russia. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nThat timeline would put Perry in the meeting when Vindman raised his objections about Sondland's request that Ukrainian officials investigate the Bidens \u2014 which Perry has repeatedly denied.\n\n\"Not once, as God is my witness, not once was a Biden name \u2014 not the former vice president, not his son \u2014 ever mentioned,\" Perry told the CBN News on Oct. 7. He repeated those denials in a Fox News radio interview last week.\n\nA DOE spokesperson said Perry stands by his earlier statement but did not comment on the July 10 meeting.\n\nPerry, who plans to step down from office on December 1, refused earlier this month to comply with congressional subpoenas seeking information on meetings and phone calls he took part in involving Ukraine officials.\n\nThe July 10 briefing where Vindman said he raised his objections came shortly after a separate meeting at the White House that day. That meeting was abruptly halted by then-national security adviser John Bolton after Sondland began discussing Ukraine conducting specific investigations in order to secure a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump.\n\nSondland has said that he, Perry and former U.S. special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker were the \"three amigos\" on Ukraine outreach for the administration.\n\nBut some Democrats have begun to question whether Sondland, a Republican donor, perjured himself during his closed-door testimony to impeachment investigators earlier this month.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have also said they also want to review allegations that Perry pressured Ukraine officials to fire from the advisory board of the country\u2019s state-owned natural gas company Amos Hochstein, a former Biden aide and State Department energy official who is also an executive at a U.S. LNG company.\n\nPerry pushed two Houston oil and gas executives to take Hochstein\u2019s place, sources said earlier, although Perry has said he only offered the two men as potential advisers to the company.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony before the three House committees spearheading the impeachment inquiry marked the most significant crack yet in the White House\u2019s blockade of witness testimony. His remarks referred to efforts by \u201coutside influencers\u201d to promote \u201ca false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney was directing that shadow campaign, which led to the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Vindman did not name Giuliani in his opening statement, but wrote he was alarmed that such efforts were inconsistent with American foreign policy and harming U.S.-Ukraine relations.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d9/cd/5d537e254525b53000b166a538ac/20191029-alexander-vindman-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
