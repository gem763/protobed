The company had earlier offered 30 million shares for $16 to $19 each.\n\nBellRing\u2019s IPO still fell short of the $570 million it was seeking to raise at the top end of that range. That could portend deepening skepticism among investors, even for companies with strong consumer brands and without aspirations for tech-level valuations.\n\nThis year\u2019s swell of tech and tech-related IPOs peaked with Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s $8.1 billion listing in May. Dismal performances by two offerings topping $1 billion in September -- SmileDirectClub Inc. and Peloton Interactive Inc. -- combined with the collapse of WeWork\u2019s plans to go public have led to a clearing of the listing decks.\n\nThe same day as Peloton\u2019s shares began trading and fell 13%, entertainment company Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. first scaled back its planned $619 million share sale and then canceled it. On Wednesday, Endeavor officially withdrew its application for an IPO.\n\nPoshmark, Postmates\n\nCompanies including fashion resale platform Poshmark Inc. and food delivery service Postmates Inc. could delay offerings until next year, people familiar with their plans have said.\n\nThe only other pending U.S. listing in BellRing\u2019s league based on current filings and data compiled by Bloomberg is China-based CloudMinds Inc. It filed in July for a listing of $500 million, a placeholder that will likely change if it decides to move ahead with an IPO.\n\nBellRing markets and distributes ready-to-drink protein shakes and other athlete-focused products like powders, nutrition bars and supplements. That\u2019s a fast-growing category as U.S. consumers increasingly embrace keto diets and lower-carb food choices, triggering rapid growth in an otherwise laggard packaged-food sector.\n\nCEO, Profit\n\nDarcy Horn Davenport, who was president of the active nutrition division under Post, will be chief executive officer of the new company, according to the company\u2019s regulatory filings.\n\nBellRing had a profit of $96 million profit on net sales of $640 million during the nine months ended June 30, up 5.3% from $608 million during the same period the previous year, according to its filings. The St. Louis-based company said its gross profit margin rose to 37% for the same period, up from 34% a year ago.\n\nThe Class A shares offered in the IPO will carry one vote each. Class B shares, which will be owned by Post, will give it 67% of the total voting power as long as Post or its affiliates own more than half of BellRing.\n\nThe offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to the filing. The company\u2019s share are expected to begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BRBR.\n\n(Updates with statement in second paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Michael Hytha in San Francisco at mhytha@bloomberg.net;Crystal Tse in New York at ctse44@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Michael Hytha, Matthew Monks\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- PowerBar maker BellRing Brands Inc. raised $480 million in an initial public offering, meeting the low end of its listing expectations by increasing the number of shares sold while lowering their price below the marketed range.In what might still be the biggest IPO of the fourth quarter", "authors": ["Michael Hytha", "Crystal Tse"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
