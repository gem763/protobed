The critic Peter G. Davis, in his 1997 book \u201cThe American Opera Singer,\u201d was quite blunt. Her 1991 Kundry at the Metropolitan Opera, he wrote, was marred by \u201coverbearing attitudinizing\u201d and \u201cexaggerated vocal mannerisms.\u201d\n\nThough harsh, he was not alone in this perception . As someone who had thrilled to her earlier work, I was distressed to hear her in a 1998 recital at Carnegie Hall, a program of songs by Poulenc, Chausson and Ellington with a string quartet, pianist and some Alvin Ailey dancers. The occasion was festive, and the reception enthusiastic, but Ms. Norman\u2019s singing was spotty. What happened in those later years?\n\nHow any \u201cattitudinizing\u201d crept into her performances was hard to fathom, given the authenticity she brought to her artistry at her best. She writes beautifully in her memoir \u201cStand Up Straight and Sing!\u201d about hearing her grandmother singing songs and spirituals, whether happy or melancholy, always \u201cbeautiful, deeply soulful and right\u201d; Ms. Norman carried on this tradition with unforgettable spirituals performances.\n\nEvery television image of \u201cAfrican-Americans being run down with water hoses and chased by dogs,\u201d she recalled, brought long lectures from her parents that \u201cwe were just as good as anyone who breathes on this planet.\u201d Perhaps that beautiful pride eventually became a kind of hauteur, but at first it instilled determination in the young Ms. Norman, the daring to take on weighty Wagner and Strauss roles so early, as well as intense curiosity for the world beyond her homeland. So she embraced the opportunity to sing with the Deutsche Oper Berlin, then, in 1975, moved to London and stopped singing staged opera for five years to develop her voice and work on other repertory.\n\nMaybe it was inevitable, but during the London years, Ms. Norman started speaking with a trace of a British accent that sometimes slipped into her singing. She insisted in interviews that this wasn\u2019t an affectation, but the result of her penchant for mimicry. If it helped make her sometimes come across like a stereotypical diva, so be it, Ms. Norman felt. The connotation of that oft-denigrated term \u2014 that is, an artist willing to be demanding for a higher purpose \u2014 actually appealed to her.", "description": "The great soprano, who died on Monday at 74, had a regal, even haughty presence, but also vocal charisma to spare.", "authors": ["Anthony Tommasini"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/obituaries/30Norman5/30Norman5-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
