The merger is subject to unitholder approval, with the scheme meeting yet to be convened.\n\nAside from generating strong investor returns in the year to date, all eight stocks have provided short-term trading opportunities for the more active and experienced investors, said SGX. They averaged at least 1 per cent swings between their intraday highs and lows on a daily basis for the 12 months to June 2019, said the bourse operator.\n\nLeading the short-term movers was Ascendas India Trust averaging 1.8 per cent swings between daily highs and lows. CapitaLand Mall Trust, CapitaLand Commercial Trust and Ascott Reit all averaged 1.6 per cent daily trading ranges. At the same time, intraday 1-minute volatility for all eight stocks was 17 per cent.\n\nThis momentum was driven by interest rate cuts and significant moves in US Treasuries this year, which affect interest rate-sensitive sectors such as Reits and banks, SGX noted. The US Treasury 10-year yields ended 2018 at 2.68 per cent, before sinking to a low of 1.43 per cent on Sept 3. Meanwhile, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has cited trade policy developments and unsolved geopolitical risk as two key reasons for cutting interest rates by 25 basis points.\n\nIn terms of distribution per unit (DPU), five out of of CapitaLand\u2019s seven Reits and trusts have recently reported DPU growth.\n\nFor instance, for H1 2019 ended June 30, CapitaLand Mall Trust posted a DPU of 5.8 Singapore cents, up from 5.59 cents a year ago. However, CapitaLand Retail China Trust\u2019s first-half DPU fell from 5.39 cents a year ago to 5.13 cents, while A-HTrust\u2019s DPU for the first quarter ended June 30 slipped from 1.35 cents to 1.28 cents.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - THE eight Singapore-listed stocks under the enlarged CapitaLand group generated higher average returns than their regional and global peers in the year to date (YTD), while also significantly outpacing broader benchmarks, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) said on Thursday. .
