Hoverboards, skateboards, scooters, motorcycles, mopeds, unicycles, tricycles\u2026 you name it, we\u2019ve ridden it. But electric bikes belong in a category of their own because they\u2019re more than just a fun tech fad. They could actually be the future of transportation.\n\nOf course, e-bikes aren\u2019t new or without controversy. Some feel threatened by the rising popularity of e-bikes, as though standard bikes will suddenly vanish like the penny-farthing once everyone goes electric. Rest assured: e-bikes won\u2019t make human-powered mobility obsolete. They may actually enhance it.\n\nthere\u2019s really no better time than right now to start shopping for an electric bike\n\nThat said, there\u2019s really no better time than right now to start shopping for an electric bike. The market is flooded with battery-powered bikes of all shapes and sizes. Boutique upstarts are jockeying for funding on Indiegogo and Kickstarter, while a handful of European companies are pushing the envelope with a variety of high-tech designs. Meanwhile, major bike manufacturers are finally waking up to the profit potential of e-bikes and are introducing their own lineups. Prices are fluctuating, but you can get a solidly built, reliable e-bike for less than $1,000.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot to choose from out there, and you don\u2019t want to get fooled, so here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nE-bikes are finally catching on in the US\n\nAs I said, e-bikes aren\u2019t new; they\u2019ve been around for decades. And if you live in China or Europe, e-bikes are probably already a way of life for you. But it wasn\u2019t always that way.\n\nFor years, European e-bikes were used primarily by people 65 and over. For seniors who were already dependent on their bikes in places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Berlin, e-bikes offered a way to continue riding for many more years. As such, e-bikes had the unfortunate reputation of being just for old people. E-bike manufacturers have been laboring to tamp down this perception, and it seems like it\u2019s working. Young urban commuters in Europe are finally giving e-bikes their attention.\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t have this perception problem, but it does have a car and infrastructure problem\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t have this perception problem, but it does have a car and infrastructure problem. As such, electric bikes are still pretty niche here: they only account for 4 percent of total bicycle sales. Compare that to more bike-friendly countries like the Netherlands where, last year, there were more e-bikes sold than regular bikes. Overall, experts predict that worldwide sales will hit $23.8 billion by 2025.\n\nE-bikes represent a small portion of the overall bike market in the US, but bike riders are slowly starting to come around. Electric bike sales jumped by an incredible 91 percent from 2016 to 2017 and then another 72 percent from 2017 to 2018 to reach an impressive $143.4 million, according to the market research firm NPD Group. Sales of electric bikes in the US have grown more than eightfold since 2014.\n\nThe major brands are noticing. Waterloo, Wisconsin-based Trek introduced its first electric bike in 1997, but no one bought it. Now, the company is gearing up to introduce a whole lineup of high-tech powerful e-bikes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be massive, because it\u2019s such an amazing product\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere will e-bikes be in ten years if I had to wave my wand right now?\u201d asked John Burke, CEO of Trek, in a recent interview with The Verge. \u201cI\u2019d say e-bikes would be at 35 percent. It\u2019s going to be massive, because it\u2019s such an amazing product.\u201d\n\nIt took a long time to get to this point. One of the first patents for a battery-powered bicycle was registered in 1895 by an inventor named Ogden Bolton Jr. His idea was simple but quite interesting: a DC electric motor installed on a bike\u2019s rear wheel hub. That motor could take up to 100 amps from a 10-volt battery, which was placed under the horizontal tube of the frame. There was no gearing system or pedals.\n\nBolton didn\u2019t actually end up making or selling any of these bikes. But amazingly, some of the same design details can be found in e-bikes today: a rear-hub motor with a battery centrally mounted in the frame.\n\nMotors, sensors, and everything in between\n\nGenerally speaking, e-bikes are bicycles with a battery-powered \u201cassist\u201d that comes when you pedal or, in some cases, use a throttle. Pushing the pedals engages a small motor, which gives you a boost, so you can zip up hills and cruise over rough terrain without breaking a sweat. Twisting a throttle does the same with no pedaling necessary.\n\nThere are two main motor types: mid-drive motors, with the motor positioned in the middle of the bike, usually between the pedals; and hub-drive motors, which are located in the center of either the front or rear wheel (usually the rear).\n\nThere are pros and cons to both. Hub-drives have been around forever and tend to be cheaper and more versatile. They\u2019re excellent motors for anyone needing a reliable e-bike for long, mostly flat commuting. Mid-drives are usually smaller and lighter and can allow for greater torque than hub-drives, making them particularly well-suited for hilly areas and off-road use. The centered position on the bike also creates a more balanced ride, and changing a tire on a mid-drive bike is usually less of a pain.\n\n\u201cMid-drives are more efficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cMid-drives are more efficient, and are usually able to deliver more torque without expanding nearly as much battery capacity,\u201d said Steven Sheffield, product manager at Bosch, which makes high-end drivetrains for e-bikes. \u201cSo if you\u2019re climbing hills, definitely if you\u2019re off road, you want to have to get a mid-drive for that efficiency uphill and the torque.\u201d\n\nE-bikes tend to use different types of sensors to determine how best to dole out power. There are two types: torque sensors and cadence sensors. Torque sensors regulate the motor based on how hard you\u2019re pushing the pedals, while cadence sensors work off of how fast you pedal. Most good bikes use torque sensors, while the low-enders have cadence only. A lot of bikes use both.\n\nI highly recommend testing out both types of motors before buying an e-bike to see which is the best fit for you. Think about how you plan on using the bike: commuting, off-roading, touring. The better e-bike brands usually match the appropriate motor placement with the type of bike they\u2019re selling. Most mountain bikes come with midrange motors, while the majority of commuter bikes sold in hill-less cities like Amsterdam are hub-based.\n\nI\u2019ve got the power!\n\nNow let\u2019s talk power. The main measurements for power are watts (W), volts (V), and amp-hours (Ah). Beyond that, things can get a little sticky.\n\nManufacturers often list \u201cpower ratings\u201d in their spec sheets. San Diego\u2019s Juiced, for example, rates the motor on its new Scorpion e-bike at 750W. But this can get confusing because rated power isn\u2019t the same thing as peak power or actual power output. Some companies creatively measure their power ratings in order to avoid EU regulations that kick in above 250W. As such, it\u2019s probably best to ignore it altogether.\n\n\u201cAttempting to compare e-bike power ratings is a great way to lose your sanity,\u201d Dan Roe writes in Bicycling magazine.\n\n\u201cAttempting to compare e-bike power ratings is a great way to lose your sanity.\u201d\n\nTo get a better idea of how much maximum power you\u2019ll actually feel, check to see if a manufacturer lists an e-bike battery\u2019s voltage and the continuous amperage (measured as amp-hours) from the motor controller. Multiply those to get the watt-hours, or the number of watts that can be delivered in an hour. This gives you a great sense of how much range you\u2019ll get out of a bike.\n\nFor example, Rad Power Bikes\u2019 cargo bike, the Radwagon, has a power rating of 750W, but a 48-volt battery pack and 14 amp-hours: 48 x 14 = 672 watt-hours. If you\u2019re thrifty with your energy usage, each mile you travel will cost you about 20 watt-hours. Therefore a 672-watt-hour pack will get you a range of about 34 miles. (Rad Power Bikes says the Radwagon can get a range of 25\u201345 miles.)\n\nKnow your classes\n\nThere are three classes of e-bikes in the US. Class 1 is pedal-assist with no throttle . Class 2 is throttle-assisted with a maximum speed of 20 mph. And Class 3 is pedal-assist only, no throttle, with a maximum speed of 28 mph.\n\nIn Europe, pedal-assisted electric bikes with 250W motors capped at 25 km/h are treated as regular bicycles. Above that, there are two regulated classes: L1e-A electric bikes can have up to 1,000W of motor power, but they require registration and insurance in some areas. This category includes electric cargo bikes popular with families. L1e-B e-bikes have 1,000W+ motors and are capable of going 45 km/h. They\u2019re basically mopeds that require a helmet and can\u2019t be ridden on bike paths. In general, e-bikes capable of 25 km/h are called pedelecs (from \u201cpedal electric bikes\u201d), whereas the faster 45 km/h bikes are called speed-pedelecs. Of course, as with most things that are European, member states have some flexibility in how the rules are applied, creating confusion for manufacturers.\n\nThe US is still playing catch-up when it comes to rules and regulations. According to the organization People for Bikes, 2019 started with 11 states using the three-class e-bike definitions. As of June 19th, 2019, 22 states are now defining e-bikes within the three classes, effectively doubling the total in just six months.\n\nLet\u2019s go shopping!\n\nSo where can you buy an e-bike? Your local bike store is the best bet because you\u2019re going to get a selection that\u2019s been curated by the owners, and people who work there are going to be able to answer all of your burning questions about performance and repairs. Amazon is another place, obviously, but there are some pretty serious trade-offs. For example, your bike could arrive banged up, and some of the companies that sell their bikes on Amazon are a bit more ephemeral: here one day and gone the next.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Amazon, of course. Many e-bikes sold in the US are just cobbled together from a variety of off-the-shelf parts found in a catalog. If that sounds easy, it\u2019s because it is, which explains why there are hundreds of e-bike companies on Kickstarter and Indiegogo trying to impress you with their flashy tech and futuristic designs.\n\nMany e-bikes sold in the US are just cobbled together from a variety of off-the-shelf parts found in a catalog\n\nMost don\u2019t come with warranties or customer support. Some are overpriced. And it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019re buying a Chinese model that\u2019s just been rebranded with Western marketing so it can be sold at a markup. If you find a bike online that you like, an interesting test is to search for the bike\u2019s specs on Alibaba and see whether there is something similar being sold in Asia. It may even be cheaper.\n\nE-bikes can come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, from city bikes with thick tires and stylish designs to cargo bikes with enough power to haul heavy loads or even a couple of kids. There are some fun retro designs and some really cool space age ones. My personal favorites are the taco mini bike designs with fat tires and long banana seats.\n\nA quick warning about crowdfunding: sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo can be a crapshoot. Sellers make big promises, but sometimes they can\u2019t deliver. According to a study run by Kickstarter in 2015, roughly 1 in 10 \u201csuccessful\u201d products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean there\u2019s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done.\n\nSome e-bike companies don\u2019t really have a choice, though. Bike makers have told me that investor cash is hard to come by these days because scooter-sharing startups like Bird and Lime have made VCs dodgy about funding new mobility startups.\n\nHow e-bikes will change transportation\n\nE-bikes lower the barriers to biking, making it easier for people who are older or more anxious about the stresses and strains of biking to justify riding. You\u2019re more likely to ditch your car or delete your Uber app if you know you can get to where you\u2019re going faster and more efficiently without getting overly tired or sweaty.\n\nMore importantly, e-bikes can rescue cities from the clutches of car culture. As noted by Curbed\u2019s Alissa Walker:\n\nA 2018 study by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities that surveyed 1,800 e-bike riders found that they bike more often, take longer trips, and make different types of trips than they do on pedal bikes. Not only did more respondents feel safer riding an e-bike than they did riding a pedal bike, the percentage of people who felt safer on an e-bike was even greater when the respondents were women, over 55, or had physical limitations. \u201cE-bikes are making it possible for more people to ride a bicycle\u201d reads the study, \u201cmany of whom are incapable of riding a standard bicycle or don\u2019t feel safe doing so.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re worried that electric power will take all the fun and recreation out of biking, well, you\u2019re wrong. Another study looked at the cognitive and psychological effects of outdoor cycling and found equal results for traditional bikes and e-bikes. Climate change got you down? E-bikes are more sustainable than electric cars, and they will help clear up traffic congestion and make cities more livable. Besides, you can always shut off the motor if you\u2019re looking for a little exercise.\n\nAs cities become more congested, some businesses are turning to e-bikes to make their deliveries. Domino\u2019s is using Rad Power Bikes to deliver pizza in a couple of cities. UPS is using cargo bikes in Seattle. German delivery company DPD wants to use these cute mini-trucks that are actually e-bikes in disguise. In New York City, e-bikes are almost exclusively used by food delivery workers.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled: the US is still far behind the rest of the world when it comes to bikes. We see them more as recreational vehicle than as a transportation alternative, something you use in fair weather, not in the rain and snow like the Dutch. But come on, the US women\u2019s national soccer team beat the Netherlands in the World Cup, so surely we can compete in the saddle as well?\n\nStreets in the US are designed for cars, and bikes and pedestrians are often just an afterthought. This marginalization has caused a shameful spike in cyclist and pedestrian deaths nationwide. E-bikes won\u2019t reverse that trend unless enough people stop driving and start pedaling. Only then will cities find themselves confronted with the choice between maintaining the status quo or redesigning their streets to be more livable, walkable, and bikeable.\n\nElectric bikes can make getting around so much easier for everyone, including older people and people with different abilities. Look, everything is terrible, and obviously, e-bikes won\u2019t solve anything unless more people start riding. But there is one thing I can promise you: once you start riding, you won\u2019t want to stop.", "description": "Electric bikes belong in their own category of rideables because they are more than just a fun tech fad.
