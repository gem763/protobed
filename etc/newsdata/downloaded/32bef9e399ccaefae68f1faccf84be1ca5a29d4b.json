There was no immediate comment from police.\n\nRiot police fired multiple volleys of tear gas in at least six locations and used water cannons in the business district in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as protesters turned streets into battlefields to spoil the Oct. 1 anniversary of Communist rule.\n\nA security clampdown in the city to thwart violence that would embarrass Chinese President Xi Jinping failed to deter the protests, including a massive march in the city center.\n\nOrganizers said at least 100,000 people marched along a broad city thoroughfare in defiance of a police ban, chanting anti-China slogans and some carrying Chinese flags defaced with a black cross. Police didn\u2019t provide an estimate of the turnout.\n\n\u201cThey are squeezing our necks so we don\u2019t breathe the air of freedom,\u201d said King Chan, a 57-year-old homemaker who came out to protest with her husband.\n\nMany demonstrators tossed wads of fake \u201chell\u201d bank notes usually used at funerals into the air. \u201cThe leaders who won\u2019t listen to our voice, this is for them,\u201d said marcher Ray Luk.\n\nThousands of people confronted police in multiple locations across the city, the largest number of simultaneous protests since the unrest began in early June over a now-shelved extradition bill that activists say was an example of how Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and citizen rights are being eroded.\n\nThe movement has since snowballed into an anti-Chinese campaign with demands for direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.\n\nThe smell of stinging tear gas and smoke from street fires started by protesters engulfed the Wan Chai, Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan and Tsim Sha Tsui areas. Protesters hurled gasoline bombs, bricks and other objects at police, who responded with volleys of tear gas.\n\nProtesters used umbrellas as shields and threw tear gas canisters back at police. Police said protesters used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun, injuring officers and some reporters.\n\nIn Wong Tai Sin, a gasoline bomb that protesters hurled at police exploded near motorcycles parked along a pavement, creating a large blaze that was put out by firefighters. Some protesters placed an emergency water hose down a subway station to try to flood it.\n\nA water cannon truck sprayed blue water, used to identify protesters, to disperse crowds from advancing to government offices in the city. Scores of police officers also stood guard near the Beijing\u2019s liaison office as the battles continued across the territory.\n\n\u201cToday we are out to tell the Communist Party that Hong Kong people have nothing to celebrate,\u201d said activist Lee Cheuk-yan as he led the downtown march. \u201cWe are mourning that in 70 years of Communist Party rule, the democratic rights of people in Hong Kong and China are being denied. We will continue to fight.\u201d\n\nActivists carried banners saying, \u201cEnd dictatorial rule, return power to the people.\u201d\n\nDressed in a black T-shirt and dark jeans, 40-year-old Bob Wong said his clothing expressed \u201cmourning\u201d over \u201cthe death of Hong Kong\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe popular LIHKG online chat forum used by protesters was inaccessible on cellphones, a move believed to have been made to prevent communication by protesters. More than two dozen subway stations and many shopping malls across the city were shut.\n\nThe protests contrasted with Beijing\u2019s anniversary festivities marked with a colorful parade and display of new missile technology. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who is in Beijing for the ceremony, smiled as a Hong Kong float passed by.\n\nIn the morning as the city\u2019s government marked the anniversary with a solemn ceremony, police used pepper spray to break up a brief scuffle between Beijing supporters and a small group of pro-democracy protesters.\n\nHong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told hundreds of guests at a reception that the city has become \u201cunrecognizable\u201d due to the violence.\n\nCheung said Beijing fully supports the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that gives Hong Kong freedoms and rights not enjoyed on the mainland. The system was implemented when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fierce clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police broke out in multiple parts of Hong Kong on Tuesday in the most widespread violence challenging Chinese rule as its Communist Party celebrated its 70th year in power.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eileen Ng", "John Leicester"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/Hong_Kong_Protests_62127.jpg-2700a_c0-0-5472-3190_s1770x1032.jpg?84283544d3cc688d49296344fdb2455c1a0f271f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
