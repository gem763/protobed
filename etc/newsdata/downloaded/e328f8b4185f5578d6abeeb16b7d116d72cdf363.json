That offset some of the gloom that had followed the bank\u2019s mixed results. Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) rose nearly 4% early in the day and was up 2.8% at 2:08 p.m. ET (18:08 GMT).\n\nThe bank reported earnings of 92 cents a share on revenue of $22.01 billion, with lower-than-expected net interest income, a key driver of the bank\u2019s profits, coming under pressure as the banking company's net interest margin dropped to 2.66% from 2.94% in the quarter from a year earlier. In the 2018 third quarter, Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) earned $1.13 a share on revenue of $21.84 billion.\n\nThe mixed earnings comes as the bank continued to fork out legal payments after it let employees create millions of fake bank accounts to meet sales quotas.\n\nThe company booked a $1.6 billion charge for legal costs related to its long-running sales-practices problems. It also had a $1.1 billion gain related to the sale of a business.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has an average price target of $49.31, a bit lower than the current price, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. The shares are up about 10% this year.", "description": "StockBeat - Wells Fargo Higher as Management Touts Improved Net Interest Income", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC9219F_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
