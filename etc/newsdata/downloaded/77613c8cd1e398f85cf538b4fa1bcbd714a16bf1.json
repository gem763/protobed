It was thanks to a superb car to drive.\n\n'Superlight': The DBS Superleggera (translating to super light) Volante is Aston Martin's new flagship drop-top GT car. Ray Massey has been getting to grips with it in sunny Spain\n\nThe powerful and sumptuous new \u00a3247,500 drop-top super grand tourer is not for the faint-hearted, nor sadly at those prices, for those of more modest income.\n\nIt has a top speed of 211mph and acceleration from a standing start to 62mph in just 3.6 seconds, and up to 100mph where legal (such as German Autobahns or tracks) in 6.7 seconds.\n\nThat's only fractions of a second slower than the hard-top coupe version of the DBS Superleggera (3.4 and 6.4 seconds respectively) whose 211mph top speed it matches.\n\nBut the first thing you notice about this cabriolet is its looks. It has real presence.\n\nDespite its awesome power, it doesn't look like a brute. It is, dare one say, quite attractive. It has even been deemed pretty by some, though I'd say handsome.\n\nWhatever adjective you use, there's no denying there's true beauty in this beast.\n\nYou have to pay a \u00a322,500 mark up on the coupe version and the Volante convertible is powered by the very same mighty 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 engine delivering 715bhp - equivalent to seven Ford Fiestas.\n\nPowerful and pricey: The 715bhp Aston costs \u00a3247,500 - so it's not for the faint-hearted, nor sadly at those prices, for those of more modest income\n\nIt has a top speed of 211mph and acceleration from a standing start to 62mph in just 3.6 seconds\n\nOpen it up on a German Autobahn or a circuit and it will accelerate to 100mph in just 6.7 seconds\n\nYou'll also pay a hefty premium of \u00a371,610 \u2013 enough to buy you a Porsche Panamera - over the rival Bentley Continental GTC convertible W12 which start from \u00a3175,890.\n\nPress the dashboard starter button to fire up the engine and there's a satisfying growl and rumble from the pair of twin exhaust pipes, then press the 'D' for drive on the centre console and press down on the accelerator and the adventure begins.\n\nThere are three main drive modes from which to choose: GT, Sport and Sport-plus.\n\nFor long-legged driving, or if you simply want to feel relaxed and chilled, the standard 'GT' mode is perfect for shooting the breeze and enjoying the surrounding scenery in comfort. But it is still pretty nimble and full of performance on twisting roads.\n\nRay Massey was among one of a select few to receive an invite to try the new Aston Martin before anyone else at the World launch\n\nThere are three main drive modes from which to choose. The first is 'GT', which is ideal for long-distance cruising\n\nThe aerodynamic soft-top roof \u2013 which opens in 14 seconds and closes in 16 - is the most advanced ever created by Aston Martin\n\nHowever, once comfortably ensconced behind the wheel and feeling like some extra engagement, I pressed the button on the steering wheel for 'Sport' mode.\n\nThe sinews tightened instantly and the exhaust note increased. Suddenly this was feeling like a very exciting performance car, with sharper acceleration, shorter gear changes and an increased sense of purpose. On tight bends it had tremendous grip.\n\nUp to this point I'd pretty much decided that 'Sport-plus' was probably best left to purists who want to test their mettle on the track, and perhaps a bit extreme for the public highway.\n\nBut in the end I decided I could not resist raising to 'DefCon 1' and pushed the switch.\n\nThe cabin feels racey from the driver's seat, especially with the digital instrument behind the sporty steering wheel. The two seats in the back should only be used for children or luggage overflow, says Ray\n\nThe engine is the same 5.2-litre V12 lump that's used in the DBS Superleggera coupe, which Ray has also driven\n\n'The cabin feels pretty snug and cossetting with the low-slung roof up. But much more fun top-down,' says Ray\n\nSuddenly the roar of the exhaust becomes a cacophony of sound. The taut and spirited performance moves up a significant level.\n\nRiding on 21-inch wheels, the car's quad exhaust system changes its soundtrack according to the driving mode selected, simmering in GT mode and becoming progressively more intense \u2013 with blips, spit and crackles, as you move up to Sport-plus.\n\nHowever, if you want to avoid waking the neighbours with an Aston Martin dawn chorus, you can choose the more discreet, 'quiet start' which eliminates the usual rousing rev start-up.\n\nThe engine is linked via carbon-fibre prop shaft to a ZF eight-speed automatic gearbox transmission.\n\nSpecially developed adaptive software gauges both the driving conditions and driver's demands help to ensure the car is in exactly the right gear at the right time when in auto mode. But for even more engagement, switching to the manual paddles on the steering wheel adds immeasurably to the driving pleasure.\n\nTo avoid waking your neighbours (and becoming immensely unpopular on your street), Aston Martin has added a discreet 'quiet start' mode which eliminates the usual rousing rev start-up\n\nTurn the driving mode into DefCon 1 Sport+ setting and the roar of the exhaust becomes a cacophony of sound. The taut and spirited performance moves up a significant level\n\nFirst deliveries are due in late summer in the UK, and selecting a few options will send the price shooting towards \u00a3300,000\n\nWhile shooting is underway on the latest 007 movie codenamed 'Bond 25', bosses at James Bond's favourite car-maker said their aim was to retain the coupe's powerful dynamics, aggressive poise and astonishing performance \u2013 but with the top down as well as up. They've succeeded.\n\nDBS Superleggera Volante: Will it fit in my garage? Price: from \u00a3247,500 On sale: now First deliveries: Late summer Style: Two-door convertible with 2+2 seating Length: 4,715mm Width: 2,145mm (including door mirrors) Rear width: 1,970mm (excluding door mirrors) Front width: 1942mm (excluding door mirrors) Height: 1,295mm Wheelbase: 2,805mm Engine: 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 Power: 715bhp Top speed: 211mph 0-62mph: 3.6 seconds 0-100mph: 6.7 seconds. Weight: 1863kg Weight distribution: 50:50 Gears: Eight-speed automatic with manual paddle-shift over-ride Wheels: 21' Ten Twin spoke with Pirelli P Zero tyres MPG: 20.1mpg CO2: 295g/km\n\nThe aerodynamic soft-top roof \u2013 which opens in 14 seconds and closes in 16 - is the most advanced ever created by Aston Martin with eight layers of insulation designed to cope with the Superleggeria Volante's ferocious acceleration.\n\nThe roof can be operated either from inside the car - or from outside within two metres using the remote key \u2013 and folds down to what Aston Martin claims is a class-leading 'stack-height' of 260mm \u2013 just over 10 inches - to maintain a smooth seamless rear profile.\n\nThat leaves an adequate amount of room in the boot for luggage, providing you're travelling relatively light.\n\nTwo airline cases and a computer bag just about filled it. But you have the overflow of the two rear seats \u2013 which are fine for children or emergency use but you'd not want to go long distances \u2013 for soft bags.\n\nThe cabin feels pretty snug and cossetting with the low-slung roof up. But much more fun top-down.\n\nFirst deliveries are expected from late Summer with customers offered an extensive options list with a high level of personal customisation.\n\nThe car-maker says its new DBS Superleggera Volante shares the aerodynamic excellence of the coupe model.\n\nThe car's rear profile has been tweaked so successfully to compensate for the soft-top that its 177kg of downforce is just 3kg less than the metal-top coupe.\n\nDesign and engineering features help to accelerate the flow of air underneath the front of the car to create downforce to keep the car glued to the road, and also assist cooling by feeding air to the front brakes.\n\nNew and deeper side strakes draw more air from the front wheel arch to reduce lift and to aid high-speed stability.\n\nIt sits very low - just 120mm of the ground excluding aerodynamic air dam below the front bumper, and 90mm including the air dam.\n\nSo watch out for those speed bumps and dropped kerbs into your driveway when parking.\n\nDespite its name - Superleggera is Italian for super lightweight - at 1863kg it does weigh 170kg more than the coupe, and reduced fuel economy of 20.1mpg compared to 22.9mpg for the coupe.\n\nSo a real gas guzzler. But if you can afford the car, the hefty fuel bills won't be a problem.\n\nDespite its name - Superleggera is Italian for super lightweight - at 1863kg it does weigh 170kg more than the coupe\n\nIt's not frugal either: fuel economy is reduced to 20.1mpg from the coupe's 22.9mpg", "description": "The powerful and sumptuous new \u00a3247,500 drop-top super grand tourer is not for the faint-hearted, nor sadly at those prices, for those of more modest income.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
