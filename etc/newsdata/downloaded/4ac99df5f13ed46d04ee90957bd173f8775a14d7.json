Quarterback Jared Goff dropped back on third-and-7 from the Saints\u2019 11 and faced immediate pressure from New Orleans\u2019 four-man rush.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSaints appear to score defensive TD\n\nSaints defensive lineman Trey Hendrickson and David Onyemata converged on Goff, and the ball came loose.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nCameron Jordan picked up the ball and ran uncontested down the sideline for what looked like a fumble recovery for a touchdown.\n\nOf course the refs blew a call that cost the Saints points against the Rams. (Reuters)\n\nExcept the play was blown dead. Officials ruled the play was an incomplete pass instead of a fumble.\n\nThe Saints challenged the call of the field, contesting that Goff had fumbled.\n\nOfficials upon review: Fumble, but no TD\n\nReplay officials agreed. They reversed the call on the field and ruled Goff had fumbled, giving the Saints possession of the ball. But the would-have-been touchdown by Jordan was for naught.\n\nSince the play was ruled dead on the field, the Saints gained possession at their own 13-yard-line.\n\nThey would not score on the possession. New Orleans turned the ball over on downs on the drive and eventually went into halftime trailing, 6-3.\n\nPayton: \u2018So tired of it\u2019\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton didn\u2019t mince words about the call when talking with Fox\u2019s Erin Andrews at halftime.\n\n\u201cI'm so tired of it,\u201d Payton told Andrews. \u201cI'm so tired of being on the wrong side of it.\u201d\n\nJordan was salty after the game, likening the officials to Foot Locker employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo disrespect to footlocker https://t.co/YhiBokGL8Z \u2014 cameron jordan (@camjordan94) September 16, 2019\n\nIn the end, the play didn\u2019t play a significant factor in the outcome of the game as the Rams rolled in the second half past a Saints team struggling without Brees to a 27-9 victory.\n\nBut for a team and fanbase still scorned over the blatant missed pass interference call against the Rams that cost them last year\u2019s NFC championship and a Super Bowl appearance, it was a heavy dose of salt on a festering wound.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Of course the refs blew a call that cost the Saints points against the Rams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0mQrj61h8.YQ7ecEqThcjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODkuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TPt_pBCybXmO2BEv5slt2Q--~B/aD0yMzUyO3c9MzM4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/fe16fdb0-d800-11e9-b75d-c60c26a6ccb7", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
