Maybe, argues the tech journalist and Times contributor Kara Swisher in Recode. When it comes to Libra, she says, there are some early signs that Facebook could be cleaning up its act:\n\nAmong other things: Facebook has promised not to link the financial information generated to its social data (i.e. this is not an explicit data play, even if it is implicitly); it has created Libra as an independent organization, run by a mostly obvious grab bag of partners (what Uber is doing in there, who knows); Calibra, Facebook\u2019s unit in Libra, is run by an experienced and P.R.-savvy exec, David Marcus; it is linking Libra with currencies like the dollar and positioning it as a \u201cstable medium of exchange,\u201d rather than a speculative investment play like bitcoin.\n\nAll of these steps suggest a potentially more \u201cadult\u201d Facebook. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust Facebook to hold my house keys,\u201d she writes, \u201cand yet I think its Libra cryptocurrency effort is exactly the right move for it to make.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorial board agrees that we should welcome Facebook\u2019s newest endeavor, albeit with an abundance of caution, since the good it could do is likely to outweigh the bad:\n\nIn the optimistic case, Libra will simply add to growing competition in the money-moving business. It should offer faster, cheaper and less irritating transactions. It might make life easier for small businesses, advertisers and anyone wanting to buy a product online. It could be of particular value to the poor, who could accept payments, pay bills, or make remittances more cheaply and without need of a bank account. \u2026 Unduly clobbering Facebook \u2014 however satisfying \u2014 could stifle that revolution before it really begins.\n\nYou definitely should not trust it\n\nA Facebook currency is a bold, bad idea, writes Matthew Stoller, author of \u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.\u201d He touches on a number of concerns that Libra poses:\n\nNational security\n\nFacebook already has more power than many countries, a threat Libra could exacerbate. For example, Mr. Stoller writes, consider how Libra could undermine diplomatic sovereignty:\n\nSanctions enforcement flows through the banking system \u2014 if you can\u2019t bank in dollars, you can\u2019t use dollars. With the success of a private parallel currency, government sanctions could lose their bite. Should Facebook and a supermajority of venture capitalists and tech executives really be deciding whether North Korean sanctions can succeed? Of course not.\n\nGovernments also charge banks with the responsibility of monitoring illegal and dangerous activity, something that Facebook has shown neither the willingness nor ability to do. Linette Lopez writes for Business Insider:\n\nThe platform will immediately have to grapple with all the darkest corners of the financial system, like terrorist financing and money laundering. These are difficult to control for even developed sovereign nations.\n\nPrivacy\n\nAs Natasha Lomas has reported for TechCrunch, Facebook has been characteristically fuzzy about what kind of privacy and data protections Libra will have, giving watchdogs around the world reason to worry. Facebook\u2019s privacy track record is already poor, but the problem would take on additional dimensions with its currency, writes Mr. Stoller:\n\nImagine Facebook\u2019s subsidiary Calibra knowing your account balance and your spending, and offering to sell a retailer an algorithm that will maximize the price for what you can afford to pay for a product. Imagine this cartel having this kind of financial visibility into not only many consumers, but into businesses across the economy. Such conflicts of interest are why payments and banking are separated from the rest of the economy in the United States.\n\nFinancial risk\n\nLibra promises to maintain a stable value , unlike Bitcoin, because it will be pegged to other existing currencies. But what happens to those other currencies if Libra\u2019s value tanks? Katharina Pistor, a professor of comparative law at Columbia Law School, writes that Libra could easily repeat the catastrophic mistakes of the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks that the public had to be bail out during the Great Recession:\n\nIt is easy to imagine a scenario in which rescuing Libra could require more liquidity than any one state could provide. Recall Ireland after the 2008 financial crisis. When the government announced that it would assume the private banking sector\u2019s liabilities, the country plunged into a sovereign debt crisis. Next to a behemoth like Facebook, many nation-states could end up looking a lot like Ireland.\n\nThe risk to the global economy, Ms. Pistor argues, is simply too serious to allow Libra to roll out next year.\n\nBad faith\n\nLibra differs from other cryptocurrencies in another crucial way: It\u2019s not truly decentralized. As Eric Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, writes in The Atlantic, Facebook will not technically operate Libra. The consortium of companies of which Facebook is a part, the Libra Association, will. He adds:\n\nHow the Libra Association will use its power is anyone\u2019s guess. The narrow money-transfer function that Facebook lays out in the white paper is just one possibility \u2014 the narrowest and least threatening one. Facebook might sincerely believe that the association will manage the Libra as a kind of glorified Western Union. But Facebook has broken its promises before.\n\nFor Ms. Lopez, the question of whether Facebook can theoretically make good on specific promises about Libra is immaterial, because the company has shown time and time again that its word in the aggregate is worthless. She writes:\n\nThere are the teens who are suing the company for profiting from data used to sell them into sex slavery. There\u2019s the horrible way Facebook and its contractors treat the people who are paid to patrol violence and misconduct on the platform. And, of course, even though Facebook knew Russian agents had used its platform to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, it did not admit to the depth and breadth of the problem until 2017. I wouldn\u2019t let Facebook water my plants, let alone monitor my banking transactions.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nDuring his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg promised that Facebook will not move forward with Libra until it gets approval from United States regulators.\n\nYet both Congress and the White House have already shown significant resistance to the idea, which could grow stronger depending on how Facebook handles its role in the next presidential election. As Casey Newton writes for The Verge, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say at this juncture whether Libra remains a viable project.\u201d\n\nDo you have a point of view we missed?
