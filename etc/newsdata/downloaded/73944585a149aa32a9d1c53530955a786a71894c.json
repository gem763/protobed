Trump\u2019s national security team planned to meet to assess the situation, he said, as US officials continue to urge Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to halt his incursion.\n\nAsked if he thought Turkey, a Nato ally, would deliberately attack US troops in Syria, Esper said: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they would or wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe cited an incident on Friday in which a small number of troops fell under artillery fire at an observation post in the north. Esper called that an example of \u201cindiscriminate fire\u201d coming close to Americans, adding it was unclear whether that was an accident.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that US officials believe Turkish forces knew Americans were in the area.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former US envoy to the global coalition against the Islamic State who resigned over Trump\u2019s attempts to withdraw from Syria, told the paper: \u201cTurkey wants us off the entire border region to a depth of 30km [20 miles]. Based on all the facts available, these were warning fires on a known location, not inadvertent rounds.\u201d\n\nOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! Donald Trump\n\nEsper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs the Turkish invasion, which began on Wednesday, was growing more dangerous.\n\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, we learned that they are likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned \u2013 and to the west,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe American troops have been working for five years with a Kurd-led Syrian group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces to combat Islamic State. Turkey has long objected to the US-Kurd alliance because Turkey considers elements of that force to be terrorists tied to an insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nThe US has now come to believe the Kurds are attempting to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with the Syrian army and Russia to counter the invading Turks, Esper said. As a result, Trump \u201cdirected that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria\u201d.\n\nIn tweets on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cVery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change \u2026 Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d\n\nEsper said he would not discuss a timeline for the US pullback, but said it would be done \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d. He did not say how many US troops would leave the north, but said they represented most of the troops in Syria.\n\nThe Pentagon had said before the operation began that the US military would not support it, and the US pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border.\n\nIt gets worse by the hour Mike Esper\n\nEsper said he was aware of reports of hundreds of Isis prisoners escaping as a result of the Turkish invasion and of atrocities being committed against Syrian Kurds by members of a Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militia.\n\n\u201cIt gets worse by the hour,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThese are all the exact things\u201d that US officials warned Erdo\u011fan would likely happen if he ignored US urgings not to invade northern Syria.\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said on Sunday.\n\nEliot Engel, the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press he could \u201cthink of nothing more disgusting in all the years I\u2019ve been in Congress than what this president is allowing to happen with the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThey have been our loyal and faithful allies for so many years, and after this, who again would trust the United States to be an ally of them?\u201d\n\nEsper said there was \u201cno way\u201d US forces could have stopped the Turks, who assembled a force of about 15,000 on the Syrian border, supported by air power.\n\nMattis: Trump's troop pullout will lead to 'disarray' in Syria and Isis resurgence Read more\n\n\u201cWe did not sign up to fight Turkey, a longstanding Nato ally, on behalf of the [Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces]. This is a terrible situation,\u201d he said.\n\nTreasury secretary Steven Mnuchin held out the possibility of quick action to impose sanctions on Turkey, a move Trump has threatened if the Turks push too far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking in new information and we\u2019re ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice to put on sanctions,\u201d Mnuchin told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cNow we have warned the Turks \u2026 They know what we will do if they don\u2019t stop these activities.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted that he was dealing with Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican senator who has stringently criticised the withdrawal, \u201cand many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought.\n\n\u201cThere is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done.
