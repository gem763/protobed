USA TODAY\n\nFormer NBC host Megyn Kelly is recognizing some of the women whom she described as \"forces for good\" in the Matt Lauer allegations.\n\nRonan Farrow's book \"Catch and Kill\" (available now) reveals a new allegation from Brooke Nevils, the previously unnamed former NBC News employee whose initial complaint led to Lauer getting fired from \"Today\" in November 2017. The book includes a claim he raped her at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nLauer denied the allegations in a lengthy letter provided by his lawyer to Variety and painted the picture of an accusation full of contradictions.\n\nKelly, whose short stint with NBC ended last October, praised women who previously worked at the peacock network to Page Six.\n\n\"Let\u2019s not lose sight of the forces for good in this story, like former Lauer co-host Ann Curry, who, despite the risks, sounded the alarm on Lauer in 2012 after a young woman complained to her, and Meredith Vieira, who, when confronted with Brooke Nevils\u2019 account, told her to go report it,\" Kelly told the outlet.\n\nRonan Farrow says NBC\u2019s alleged cover-up of sexual misconduct is \u2018bigger\u2019 than Matt Lauer\n\nNBC News chief Noah Oppenheim tells staff Ronan Farrow has 'an axe to grind'\n\nMegyn Kelly (Photo: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Fortune)\n\nCurry, in 2018, recalled to The Washington Post: \"A woman approached me and asked me tearfully if I could help her. She was afraid of losing her job. ... I believed her.\"\n\nAt the employee's request, Curry did not name her, but did specifically call out Lauer.\n\n\"I told management they had a problem and they needed to keep an eye on him and how he deals with women,\" said Curry.\n\nVariety reports: \"A distraught Vieira, according to the book, urged Nevils to go to NBC Universal human resources with a lawyer, which she did.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to a rep for Kelly for further comment.\n\nGretchen Carlson is 'frustrated' she can't participate in 'Bombshell' film about Fox News\n\n'We try to do all of this with integrity': Charlize Theron talks Megyn Kelly 'Bombshell' role\n\n\"I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period,\" Lauer wrote in his letter. \"My silence has been a mistake. Old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It\u2019s outrageous. So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support I say 'enough.'\"\n\nLauer denied Nevils' allegations as \"categorically false.\" He said the two had a \"sexual encounter\" at the 2014 Sochi Olympics but maintained their relationship was \"extramarital, but consensual.\"\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/15/matt-lauer-allegations-megyn-kelly-lauds-meredith-vieira-ann-curry/3983348002/", "description": "Former NBC host\u00a0Megyn Kelly is recognizing some of the females whom she described as \"forces for good\"\u00a0in the Matt Lauer scandal.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
