Erdogan also intends to fly to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who allegedly seeks to prevent a war between Turkey and Syria.\n\n\u201cYesterday we spoke with the Chaldean bishop of Aleppo, Msgr. Antoine Audo,\u201d Bishop Yaldo told AsiaNews, and \u201che described a situation of great confusion to us.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition composed largely of Kurdish fighters, has accused the Turkish military and its proxies of genocide against the Kurdish people, saying they employ tactics \u201csimilar to ISIS.\u201d\n\nKurdish leaders have called the endeavor to replace indigenous Kurdish populations with largely Arab refugees an attempt at ethnic cleansing.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "An Iraqi bishop says there is a \u201cstrong fear\u201d that ISIS may return thanks to the Turkish offensive against the Kurds in Syria.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
