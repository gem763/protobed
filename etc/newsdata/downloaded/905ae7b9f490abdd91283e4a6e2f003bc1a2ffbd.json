The 2016 messages were sent months before the aircraft entered service.\n\nBoeing has begun taking steps to increase safety oversight in its industrial operations and at the board level, he added.\n\nIts timeline of a fourth quarter MAX return compares to a January target from European regulators, while major U.S. carriers United, Southwest, and American were all scheduling without the MAX until next year.\n\nBoeing also said there was \u201cno significant change\u201d to estimated payments to airline customers related to the 737 MAX grounding, part of the $8 billion (\u00a36.2 billion) price tag Boeing has estimated for the MAX crisis.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Boeing logo is displayed on a screen, at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 7, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. manufacturer reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit and had a negative free cash flow of $2.89 billion in the quarter, compared with a positive free cash flow of $4.10 billion a year earlier.\n\nCore operating earnings fell to $895 million or $1.45 per share, from $1.89 billion or $3.58 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNEW SETBACKS\n\nMuilenburg said the company was making good progress on testing the final software fix for the 737 MAX and developing related training materials, though the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday that it will need at least several more weeks for review.\n\nThe MAX has eclipsed work on a potential new mid-market airplane, Muilenburg said, and other industrial setbacks broadened pressure on the company\u2019s new commercial leadership.\n\nBoeing named veteran executive Stan Deal, who had been running its two-year-old Global Services Division, to the top job at commercial airplanes. Deal\u2019s challenge to get the MAX back into service globally while simultaneously handling new aircraft deliveries and boosting 737 production is seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry\u2019s history.\n\nAfter the 737 MAX safety ban in March, Boeing cut 737 monthly production from 52 aircraft to 42 and halted deliveries, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins.\n\nIt told suppliers in late July it planned to increase production from 42 to 47 single-aisle aircraft per month in October, return to the pre-crash rate of 52 aircraft per month in February 2020, and hit a record stride of 57 single-aisle jets per month in June 2020, industry sources said.\n\nThat schedule - now delayed by months - was contingent on winning regulatory approval early in the fourth quarter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Muilenburg said General Electric (GE.N) was making \u201cgood progress\u201d addressing problems with its GE9X engine for 777X, and the aircraft was still on track for a first flight in early 2020. But Boeing was now targeting early 2021 for the first delivery of the 777X, and sees 3 total 777-program deliveries per month in 2020, verses 3.5 per month in 2019, Muilenburg said.\n\nWith the 777-8 and 777-9, Boeing aims to maintain its grip on the \u2018mini-jumbo\u2019 market by leap-frogging rival Airbus\u2019 (AIR.PA) 365-seat A350-1000 and scooping up fresh orders following the demise of the A380 superjumbo.\n\nCiting global trade tensions and a lack of orders from China, America\u2019s largest exporter was also reducing the 787 Dreamliner production rate to 12 airplanes per month for approximately two years beginning in late 2020.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBoeing faced additional uncertainty over future production rates for its Dreamliner earlier this month from lost business theoretically putting a hole in production after Boeing increased its build-rate to 14 aircraft per month from 12 at twin U.S. factories.\n\nBoeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said the company\u2019s cash profile was more challenging than before, but long-term objectives unchanged. Boeing also said it does not anticipate share buybacks until 737 MAX returns to service.", "description": "Boeing Co cut production of its flagship Dreamliner and delayed the arrival of a successor to its 777 mini-jumbo, piling new pressures on a rejigged senior management team on Wednesday as the continued safety grounding of its 737 MAX sliced third-quarter profits.", "authors": ["Ankit Ajmera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444101128&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M117", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
