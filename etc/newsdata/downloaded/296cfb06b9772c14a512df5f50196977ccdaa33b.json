But the sensationalist attacks we suffered from the large part of the international media over the fires in the Amazon awakened our patriotic feelings,\u201d he said, accusing foreign critics of questioning Brazil\u2019s sovereignty over the region in a disrespectful and \u201ccolonialist\u201d manner.\n\nWhat is the point of the UN general assembly? Read more\n\nThat line was a clear jab at Macron with whom Bolsonaro is locked in a long-running diplomatic feud that escalated last month after the French president urged international action over the Amazon fires and Bolsonaro responded by insulting Macron\u2019s wife.\n\nBolsonaro reiterated pledges to reduce the size of protected indigenous territories and to open such areas up to commercial mining.\n\n\u201cBrazil now has a president who cares about those who were here before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500. Indians don\u2019t want to be poor landowners living on rich soils \u2013 especially the richest soils on Earth,\u201d he said.\n\nBolsonaro claimed the foreign NGOs and governments who opposed that view did so because they themselves had their eyes on the mineral wealth and biodiversity within Brazil\u2019s indigenous reserves.\n\nIn an attempt to portray himself as a friend of Brazil\u2019s indigenous communities Bolsonaro invited a rare indigenous supporter, Ysani Kalapalo, to attend his address and donned an indigenous necklace after arriving in New York.\n\nBut S\u00f4nia Guajajara, one of Brazil\u2019s best-known indigenous leaders, dismissed Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to pose as an indigenous defender as a farce.\n\n\u201cThis is an attempt to trick the world and show he has support. But \u2026 it is another of his big lies. It doesn\u2019t matter what image he wants to project. What matters are his actions \u2013 which the world whole is seeing,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, the Brazilian Climate Observatory NGO said: \u201cAs expected, Bolsonaro\u2019s speech \u2026 has doubled down on division, nationalism and on ecocide \u2026 Bolsonaro\u2019s policies bring an immediate risk to all humankind.\u201d", "description": "In a combative UN address Bolsonaro denied \u2013 contrary to the evidence \u2013 that the world\u2019s largest rainforest was being devastated", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44649df8431f20ad045e1d4fe7bfab9fc6eabec1/0_0_5334_3200/master/5334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5bb1e9f9a5738923695d9aefeac44cff", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
