I don\u2019t feel safe living there anymore after knowing he was able to smash the window and get in.\n\n\u2018I was settled before the incident took place. I had to live with my window boarded up for a while.\n\n\u2018Dobbie is a small, defenceless pup who would not hurt anyone.\n\n\u2018I absolutely broke my heart. I turned up in a taxi when I heard what had happened and I could see Dobbie with blood coming from his mouth. I could not hold or move him.\n\nDobbie was almost put down following incident, but his owner managed to raise funds for an operation (Picture: Media Wales)\n\n\u2018I could not believe someone would do that to an animal. I could not understand it. I didn\u2019t expect to see it at all.\n\n\u2018He is a lovely family pet, I had rescued him from an abusive home. He has always been quite a nervous dog anyway.\n\n\u2018The last month has been awful. It\u2019s been really hard. When it first happened I slept on the floor next to him for a week.\u2019\n\nWilliams, a carpenter, had initially denied any wrongdoing but changed his plea ahead of a trial. He will be sentenced next month.\n\nDobbie still needs an operation that is expected to cost in the region of \u00a33,000\n\nMiss Davies added that, as a single mother in receipt of benefits, she\u2019d had to rely on the help of others to fund the bills to help Dobbie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A family member donated \u00a31,000,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I have been doing little things like cupcake stalls with all the funds going towards Dobbie. We\u2019ve also set up a fundraising page which is growing slowly.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
