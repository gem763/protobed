Eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin that leads to redness, blistering, oozing, scaling and thickening. It usually appears in the first few months of life and affects around 10 per cent of babies. Eczema's cause is not fully understood but it is thought to be brought on by the skin's barrier to the outside world not working properly, which allows irritants and allergy-inducing substances to enter. It may be genetic due to the condition often running in families. As well as their skin being affected, sufferers may experience insomnia and irritability. Many factors can make eczema worse. These may include: Heat, dust, soap and detergents\n\nBeing unwell, such as having a cold\n\nInfections\n\nDry skin\n\nStress There is no cure for eczema, however, 70 per cent of childhood sufferers no longer have the condition in their teens. Patients should avoid known triggers for flare ups and use emollients.

However, it is well established they are at a heightened risk of other diseases.\n\n'We don\u2019t want small babies but we would like to understand how poorer growth or slower growth before birth is protective against allergy,' Dr Gatford said.\n\nBoth food allergies and eczema are considered immune-mediated diseases caused by a combination of genes and external factors.\n\nThe team said it is possible babies with a lower birth weight have a lower immune system, which normalises as they age and therefore does not affect them growing up.\n\nThey may also have a more favourable balance of immune cells that protect them against pathogens.\n\nIt is not clear if the risks persist as a person grows up or if they are just present in childhood.\n\nDr Gatford said: 'You don\u2019t necessarily grow out of childhood allergies, sometimes you do and sometimes you don\u2019t.\n\n'Things like an egg allergy a lot of kids will grow out of, whereas peanut allergies are much more likely to persist.'\n\nThe findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\n\nMore than 150million Europeans suffer from chronic allergic diseases, according to Allergy UK.\n\nThe UK has some of the highest prevalence rates of allergic conditions in the world, with a staggering 44 per cent of British adults suffering from at least one allergy.\n\nAlmost one in 12 young children suffer from a food allergy and charities believe they are becoming increasingly common.", "description": "Mothers are being urged by researchers in Australia to 'seek advice' if their baby is heavy.
