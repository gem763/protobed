Or something like that.\n\nIn any event, the tour's third event has given us that first spectacular and quintessential Mickelson moment. Well, spectacular in a good way, that is. Mickelson did make a 9 at last week's Safeway Open. On Friday at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, the slimmed down 49-year-old looked like he could be on his way to another big number when his tee shot on TPC Summerlin's par-4 2nd went way left.\n\nRANKING: Why Phil Mickelson is the Content King of the PGA Tour\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMickelson could have taken a free drop since his stance placed him on the cart path, but apparently, he felt confident in his famed calves keeping him balanced. He also obviously didn't mind hitting his golf ball from a gravel lie. Watch and learn, people. This is how you pull off an escape shot.\n\nIncredible. It's gotta be the calves.\n\nMickelson made par on the hole to stay at six under after an opening 65 had him near the leaders after Day 1. That was the lowest score since February for Mickelson, who is in the midst of a busy fall stretch that will determine if Tiger Woods makes him a captain's pick for December's Presidents Cup. And if Tiger thinks he needs someone at Royal Melbourne capable of hitting off gravel, well, he's got his guy.\n\nRELATED: Even Tom Brady is jealous of Phil Mickelson's calves\n\nWATCH MORE GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS\n\nOriginally Appeared on Golf Digest\n\n", "description": "Phil Mickelson's escape game is already in mid-season form at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/M0XJGgOQ5_Ke6fWGkbfI6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMjM5LjkxMDUxNDU0MTM4Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xMb69pv6Pfk8iQ9Z1aO3AQ--~B/aD04NjY7dz04OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/golf_digest_7/01645c810702f8b112c0d3e9afa9194f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
