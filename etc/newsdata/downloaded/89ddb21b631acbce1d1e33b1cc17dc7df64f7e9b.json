Why do racial preferences continue to be used in determining college admission despite their suspect Constitutionality? Thank Justice Lewis Powell: \u201cPowell, writing the controlling opinion in an otherwise divided court, introduced the concepts that would tarnish all subsequent legal analysis in the area. UC Davis\u2019s explicit set-asides violated Bakke\u2019s right to be free from racial discrimination, Powell held. If a school left its desired level of minority enrollment officially unquantified, however, the Court would accept a series of cascading fictions on the way to upholding that school\u2019s racial preferences. Those fictions clustered under the umbrella of \u2018holistic review.\u2019 An admissions office that practices holistic review allegedly evaluates each applicant as a unique individual and not simply as the representative of a race; it treats an applicant\u2019s race as just one smallish \u2018plus\u2019 factor among many helping him get admitted; racial preferences are a plus for the preferred group but not a negative for the unpreferred group; even if a school has \u2018minimum goals\u2019 for minority enrollment, those minimum goals are different from numerical quotas. Powell never explained why an individual who is penalized because he is of the wrong race suffers a constitutional harm if that discrimination occurs in the name of an explicit quota, but not if the discrimination is in the service of a putatively less numerical racial \u2018goal.\u2019 The other fictions were equally strained.\u201d\n\nWhat can colleges do to help low-income students succeed? Not much. Low-income students who attended elite high schools tend to do well at college. Those who didn\u2019t struggle: \u201cOverall, The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges are Failing Disadvantaged Students is two books in one. The first \u2018book\u2019 tells a compelling story about the role \u2018gateway institutions,\u2019 like high schools, play in equipping students with the skills to flourish in college. In making his case, [Anthony Abraham] Jack is solidly in the sociological tradition of Shamus Rahman Khan and Binder and Wood. Each of these authors recognize that a student\u2019s cultural competence stems from broad institutional influences, not just from the family. The distinction between the Privileged Poor and the Doubly Disadvantaged, along with the illustrations of how both groups of students navigate elite college campuses, is insightful and contains potential avenues for further exploration. The second \u2018book\u2019 devolves, unfortunately, into a clumsy discussion of inequality, structural racism and privilege.\u201d\n\nJames Prosek, an American original: \u201cAs a college junior, he wrote an illustrated history of trout\u2014and he\u2019s been an outside-the-box artist ever since.\u201d\n\nThe lessons of Ronald Welch\u2019s Mohawk Valley: \u201cYou should never camp in a ravine. Look for higher ground, and a windbreak \u2014 a fallen tree is fine, but rocks are the best. Gather balsam wood for bedding, and use your tomahawk to cut firewood from a dead tree. Make two fires. Set the bigger one against the rocks for warmth, and spread the ashes of the smaller one over the ground you wish to sleep on \u2014 they will stop it being so cold and damp. Catch fish from the river, but keep an eye out for Indians moving silently through the forest on moccasined feet. This much I have learnt from Ronald Welch\u2019s Mohawk Valley. I just wish I had read it as a boy, for it would have furnished my bivouacking trips in the woods with a far greater level of detail. I would not have depended so much on being a cowboy, an Indian, a Viking. I could have been Alan Carey, learning how to live as a backwoodsman in America in the 1750s.\u201d\n\nThe deceptive simplicity of Peanuts: \u201cThe genius of Peanuts is that it seems simple, replicable. But simplicity and complexity are arbitrary categories; where is the a priori boundary that separates one from the other? The true undergirding of lasting works of art is the embrace of contradictions, and Peanuts is no exception: it is at once universal and idiosyncratic, miniature and vast, constrained and infinite, composed and improvised, claustrophobic and inviting, caustic and sentimental, funny and sad. Moreover, what a wonderfully strange strip it is, this internal world playacted by ciphers. A playwright famously noted that every character is the author, and Peanuts exemplifies this truth.\n\nThe costs of a desynchronized workweek: \u201cWhereas we once shared the same temporal rhythms\u2014five days on, two days off, federal holidays, thank-God-it\u2019s-Fridays\u2014our weeks are now shaped by the unpredictable dictates of our employers. Nearly a fifth of Americans hold jobs with nonstandard or variable hours. They may work seasonally, on rotating shifts, or in the gig economy driving for Uber or delivering for Postmates. Meanwhile, more people on the upper end of the pay scale are working long hours. Combine the people who have unpredictable workweeks with those who have prolonged ones, and you get a good third of the American labor force. The personalization of time may seem like a petty concern, and indeed some people consider it liberating to set their own hours or spend their \u2018free\u2019 time reaching for the brass ring. But the consequences could be debilitating for the U.S. in the same way they once were for the U.S.S.R. A calendar is more than the organization of days and months. It\u2019s the blueprint for a shared life.\u201d\n\nNetflix tests a new feature that allows users to speed-watch titles. Directors don\u2019t like the idea, obviously.\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nJohn Ashbery was preoccupied with flux. Could this lead to anything other than minor successes? Arthur Krystal takes stock of Ashbery\u2019s accomplishment:\n\nJust in case we still weren\u2019t sure, Other Traditions reminds us that Ashbery was not interested in writing the perfect poem. Instead, he sympathizes with John Clare, \u2018whose habit, one might even say whose strength, was imperfect.\u2019 Ashbery welcomed imperfection, not because he found it charming, but because it\u2019s an element of thought. One doesn\u2019t always think logically or sequentially, so one needn\u2019t pretend to. Which works if you\u2019re John Ashbery, but not very well for you or me.\n\n\u201cAfter quoting approvingly Schubert\u2019s lines: \u2018But the poem is just this / Speaking of what cannot be said / To the person I want to say it,\u2019 Ashbery acknowledges, almost casually, that he \u2018enjoy[s] Schubert more than Pound or Eliot.\u2019 And part of what he enjoys is that Schubert\u2019s work \u2018manages to render itself immune to critical analysis or even paraphrase.\u2019 This is, needless to say, a tactical shift in taste about modernist poetry, whose value was associated with the textual analysis of Jarrell, Blackmur, Wilson, Tate, and Winters. Ashbery doesn\u2019t dismiss formalist poets; he just prefers the poem that can\u2019t be pinned down. As did Laura Riding, I imagine that he, too, would caution readers \u2018not to construe my poems as poetry in the generally understood sense of the term.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this temperamental attraction to the offbeat and eccentric that drew Ashbery to the literary antics and self-referential strategies of Roussel, Duchamp, and Apollinaire. We\u2019re not talking Jabberwockysilly or Ogden Nash\u2013like noodlings. The French writers were both playful and deadly earnest about their non-sense; it shored up a philosophical approach to life, which, I\u2019m afraid to say, wears thin the older one grows, although Tristan Tzara\u2019s amiable poem \u2018To Make a Poem\u2019 reads like early Ashbery. Nonetheless, after a certain age, one may be excused for ho-humming conceptual art and the linguistic playfulness of the avant-garde. Indeed, one may find an earlier French writer, who also dabbled in the ridiculous, more congenial: \u2018tirez le rideau, la farce est jou\u00e9e.\u2019 But before it\u2019s over, it has meaning; it matters. And if a work of art is to matter, it has to matter to people other than the artist. In short, a work that takes its audience only to the end of the artist\u2019s own mind is simply an intellectual exercise. How many people attend a performance of John Cage\u2019s 4\u201933\u2019\u2019 more than once?\n\nAll this is to say\u2014what probably will annoy his admirers\u2014that Ashbery succeeds despite his influences. For good and for ill, he liked to experiment, and experiment, by implication, contains the possibility of failure. Reviewing The Tennis Court Oath (1962), John Simon observed that Ashbery \u2018has perfected his verse to the point where it never deviates into\u2014nothing so square as sense!\u2014sensibility, sensuality, or sentences.\u2019 Even critics sympathetic to Ashbery\u2019s modus operandi shook their heads at his willful evasions. As late as 1990, Dana Gioia, acknowledging Ashbery\u2019s unique sound, his \u2018gift of felicitous, natural phrasing,\u2019 concluded that \u2018he is a marvelous minor poet, but an uncomfortable major one.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Costa Imagna\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
