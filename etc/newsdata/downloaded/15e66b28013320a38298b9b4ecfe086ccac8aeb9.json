He\u2019s seen fighters break from the pack and emerge as big names for the company, and he clearly sees star quality in women\u2019s flyweight prospect Maycee Barber.\n\nBarber (8-0 MMA, 3-0 UFC) registered the latest win of her perfect career on Friday with an emphatic first-round TKO of Gillian Robertson at UFC on ESPN 6 in Boston. Speaking to reporters, including MMA Junkie, backstage at the post-fight press conference, White was brimming with positivity about the 21-year-old\u2019s career trajectory.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a gangster, this girl,\u201d White grinned. \u201cI love everything about this girl. You should see the crazy texts she sends me all the time, including tonight. As soon as the fight was over she started texting me.\n\n\u201cShe wants to fight everybody and she wants to do this and: \u2018I told you! I told you I was gonna do this!\u2019 I love her attitude, I love how badly she wants to be a world champion, I love how she finishes fights.\u201d\n\nMany believed Barber was set to face the toughest test of her career against Robertson, a gritty rising prospect herself, whose grappling skills had taken her to four stoppage wins from her previous five UFC outings.\n\nBut Barber shut down Robertson\u2019s submission game at source as she stuffed her opponent\u2019s takedown attempts, then punished her on the feet with powerful striking.\n\nIt resulted in a first-round finish that left White admitting that he is excited to see just how high the ceiling is for Barber\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cShe fought a very tough girl tonight, and she stopped her,\u201d White said. \u201cShe looked incredible. She\u2019s fun and it\u2019s going to be fun for all of us and the fans to watch her grow over the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nThe speed of Barber\u2019s rise and the dominant nature of her victories \u2013 seven of her eight career wins have come via stoppage, including all three of her UFC appearances \u2013 has led some to offer comparisons with another certain female fighter who burst onto the scene in a blaze of finishes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call her Ronda Rousey, but if you look at a young Ronda Rousey, she was arm-barring everybody,\u201d White said. \u201cThis girl put on a striking clinic tonight. I think Maycee is Maycee. She\u2019s somebody completely different. But I love her intensity, I love her attitude I love that she wants to be a world champion before everybody else was. It\u2019s fun.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fun to watch, she\u2019s fun to listen to. I posted an interview with her today and if you sit and listen to the whole interview, she speaks really well, she\u2019s very smart and, yeah, I can\u2019t say enough good things about her. She\u2019s fun.\u201d", "description": "Dana White admits he's excited for what the future might hold for young flyweight starlet Maycee Barber after her win at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "The Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Samano", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/maycee-barber-ufc-boston.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
