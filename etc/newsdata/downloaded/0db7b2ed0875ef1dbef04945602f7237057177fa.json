Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks during the Climate Forum at Georgetown University on Thursday. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nAnother week, another town hall about climate change.\n\nMSNBC kicked off its televised climate forum for 2020 presidential candidates at Georgetown University on Thursday, inviting a dozen White House hopefuls to sit down and answer questions from moderators and college students ahead of a major youth climate march on Friday. The two-day event comes just two weeks after one of MSNBC's rivals, CNN, staged its own seven-hour-long climate forum.\n\nThe candidates didn't deviate much from what they've said in past campaign speeches and during previous debates. But there were a few thing that caught the Energy 202's eye:\n\nBernie Sanders and fossil-fuel jobs: The Vermont senator acknowledged to MSNBC host Chris Hayes that his ambitious plan to end the use of fossil fuels will lead to the loss of jobs in the oil, gas and coal sectors.\n\nWhat he said: \"I\u2019m not going to say Chris, you know if you want to press the point, that there aren\u2019t people who will be hurt. I got that. And it doesn\u2019t make me happy.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to say Chris, you know if you want to press the point, that there aren\u2019t people who will be hurt. I got that. And it doesn\u2019t make me happy.\" Why it matters: For a candidate who likes to call himself the most \"pro-worker\" member of Congress, any potential pink slips are a weak spot in pitching his $16.3 trillion Green New Deal. But Sanders added that transitioning to a cleaner economy will create \"up to 20 million good paying jobs.\" His climate plan also recognizes the issue too, offering five years of unemployment insurance and other benefits to laid-off oil field workers, coal miners and other laborers.\n\nAndrew Yang and GDP: The tech entrepreneur made his pitch for reforming the way gross domestic product, or GDP, is calculated.\n\nWhat he said: \"As your president, I'm just going to go down the street to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and say: Hey. GDP. A hundred years old. Kind of out of date. Let's modernize it.\"\n\n\"As your president, I'm just going to go down the street to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and say: Hey. GDP. A hundred years old. Kind of out of date. Let's modernize it.\" Why it matters: The oft-cited statistic is supposed to track a nation's entire economic output. But an increasing number of left-leaning economists and other thinkers \u2014 including Yang \u2014 say it falls short as a measure of well-being since it does not properly take into account damage to the environment.\n\nJohn Delaney and emergency powers: The former Maryland congressman suggested he would consider invoking emergency powers as president to tackle climate change.\n\nWhat he said: \"I would use every single executive authority I could possibly muster, including considering a national emergency, to get this done ... That's how important I think this is.\"\n\n\"I would use every single executive authority I could possibly muster, including considering a national emergency, to get this done ... That's how important I think this is.\" Why it matters: Delaney is not the only candidate to suggest using an emergency declaration to fund emissions-reduction efforts should Congress fail to pass climate legislation with the next Democratic president. So have Sanders and financier Tom Steyer. But the fact that a self-described moderate like Delaney would consider taking that step suggests the idea is gaining traction with elected Democrats. Delaney, though, did go on to note that the only way to make \"enduring change\" is by passing laws.\n\nMarianne Williamson and national service: The author and activist told students listening at Georgetown she wants to compel their age group into serving in a climate-related national service program.\n\nWhat she said: \"I'm going to ask all of you. Maybe not all of you. I would like to ask you your opinion. I think during this season of repair we should have a mandatory national service \u2014 one year \u2014 for people between the ages of 18 and 26, because we need you. We need to fix this climate.\"\n\n\"I'm going to ask all of you. Maybe not all of you. I would like to ask you your opinion. I think during this season of repair we should have a mandatory national service \u2014 one year \u2014 for people between the ages of 18 and 26, because we need you. We need to fix this climate.\" Why it matters: The idea of a \"climate corps\" \u2014 something akin to the Peace Corps launched in 1961 by John F. Kennedy \u2014 has been suggested by other candidates, such as Delaney and Cory Booker, as a way of preparing communities for the effects of climate change and responding to natural disasters. But none of the other White House hopefuls are asking for mandatory service.\n\nRounding out Thursday's lineup were Michael Bennet, Julian Castro and Tim Ryan. Booker, Steve Bullock, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer and Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump in the primary, are set to speak Friday.\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\n\u2014 EPA pushes back on an E&E News investigation: A recent, deeply reported story from E&E News found EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson has intervened numerous times in the agency\u2019s environmental enforcement process. In one case, he helped fix a $100,000 problem for a fellow Oklahoma Republican whose client was accused of emitting smog-forming pollution.\n\n\u201cJackson's previously unreported role as an enforcement fixer for friends and allies \u2014 pieced together from internal agency records, enforcement documents, company financial filings and interviews \u2014 makes some former career EPA enforcement staffers question whether Jackson is abusing his powerful position to benefit favored companies and lobbyists,\u201d E&E News reports.\n\nThe pushback: Jackson and another EPA official told the publication that it wasn\u2019t a problem for him or any political appointee to get involved in such cases. \u201cA chief of staff has specific responsibilities, but broader responsibilities to ensure a variety of things get completed, addressed, and worked out,\u201d Jackson said. In a series of tweets from the agency\u2019s main account, the EPA said the story was \u201cfull of more inaccurate innuendo than EPA has time to correct.\u201d It also resurfaced a press release from February in which it called another E&E News story \u201chogwash.\u201d\n\nThe silhouette of a pump jack in a Midland, Tex., oil field.
