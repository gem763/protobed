To remain is not on the table, we did not argue when we lost in 75, it was a done deal. Despite of course we were illegally entered. It should be simple for Boris to apply British law-Which states No act/statute/law may be made that is binding upon successive parliaments. Ie one cannot make any law that no future parliament can change. Therefore perhaps Gina Miller would care to follow on the simple legalities of us agreeing to supremacy of EU law and thus breaking British law in the process. We cannot ever permit supremacy of EU law which would mean the EU can bind our parliament because the whole of the British political system could not undo a single EU law. We are also forbidden from ceding power to any foreign party As confirmed by the bill of rights 1689. So whilst these laws were broken, whilst a massive decision affecting us was made and ratified after the fact, our entry could never be legal. But regardless we finally got a second say, we had the legislation in place for the referendum, it was done legally. We had the process that took us to article 50 legally and that means unless BOTH parties agree to an asked for extension-We leave, deal or no deal, on the 31st October. Parliament has been put in the current position because remain Mp's have actually said even a second referendum (or actually, a 3rd as it would be) if it returned a leave still, they would STILL battle against that result rather than enact it. Political parties have committed election rigging by removing a candidate for a party solely to force thru a remain vote for the party they most hope to have power to stop Brexit. Remain Mp's MUST be stopped, prorogue or any sensible means because they have declared they will NOT do as the electorate asked, they will NOT respect democracy. As such they are not fit for their posts", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"}
