Gaming market research firm Newzoo puts the global market for gaming at $152.1bn, with China ($36.5bn) and the US ($36.9bn) together accounting for nearly half of that total.\n\nIn a statement, Google said the game was removed because it violated Google Play's policies.\n\n\"We have a longstanding policy prohibiting developers from capitalising on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game,\" Google said.\n\nGoogle noted it had pulled apps previously for attempting to profit from other high-profile events such as earthquakes, crises, suicides and conflicts.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protecting Hong Kong's young protesters: \"Beat us, don't beat the kids\"\n\nThe move comes just days after an online gamer from Hong Kong was removed from an international tournament for the game Hearthstone because he expressed support for the protestors during a livestream.\n\nActivision Blizzard said the gamer, identified as \"Blitzchung\", had violated rules and would not be allowed to play in any Hearthstone e-sports games for the next 12 months.\n\nThe company said the competition rules banned any behaviour that might cause public disrepute or offend a portion or group of the public.\n\nThe official Chinese publication the Global Times said Chinese social media users thought Activision Blizzard's move was an example of \"how to be responsible in the Chinese market,\" but move has drawn protest on social media elsewhere, with many gamers calling for a boycott of Blizzard.\n\nThe boycott has been trending on Twitter and in some cases former fans have posted pictures of their cancelled subscriptions on the Reddit gaming thread.\n\nOn the Hong Kong subreddit a number of players have suggested turning Mei, a Chinese hero in the game Overwatch, into a pro-Hong Kong character.\n\nThey hope the move would hit Activision Blizzard's sales by getting the game banned in China.\n\nDespite the boycott, a mobile version of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty video game has been downloaded more than 100 million times in its first week.\n\nChinese tech company Tencent owns a stake in Activision Blizzard, which generated $7.5bn in revenue last year.", "description": "Another company faces a boycott for banning an esports player who supported the protestors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C9F2/production/_109189615_gettyimages-1174665368.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
