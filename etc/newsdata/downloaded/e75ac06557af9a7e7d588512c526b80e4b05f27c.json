Officials said the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, aimed to restore about a third of the disrupted output by day\u2019s end Monday.\n\nSaudi Arabia held a series of calls with cartel members and other oil-producing allies over the weekend and told producers that they wouldn\u2019t need to respond with additional output, Saudi and OPEC officials said. Saudi energy officials fear that other members might begin pumping too much and take away some of the kingdom\u2019s market share, Saudi oil officials and advisers said. Saudi officials told cartel members that the kingdom would mitigate the outage by tapping into its reserves, the Saudi and OPEC officials said.\n\nThe strikes knocked out 5.7 million barrels of daily production, about half of Saudi capacity. One of the main targets of the attack was a large crude-processing plant in Abqaiq.\n\nStill, Sara Vakhshouri, president of Washington, D.C., consulting firm SVB Energy International, said, \u201cThe Kingdom has enough domestic crude oil inventories to cover its production suspension of 5.7 (million barrels a day) for almost 30 days.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump provided some relief late Sunday by authorizing the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed to stabilize energy markets. The president also said he had \u201cinformed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think of President Trump\u2019s response to release oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize energy markets? Join the conversation below.\n\nMohammed Barkindo, the secretary-general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, ruled out an emergency meeting after speaking to the International Energy Agency and officials in Saudi Arabia, OPEC officials said.\n\nRussia, a key participant in an OPEC-led agreement to cut production, also doesn\u2019t see the need for emergency measures, according to statements Monday from Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak.\n\n\u201cRight now there is a fairly large amount of reserves in the world\u201d to compensate for the decline in Saudi output, Mr. Novak was quoted as saying by Russian newswire Interfax. \u201cThere is no need to take some sort of extra urgent [measures],\u201d he said.\n\nThe cautious global response comes after Saudi Arabia assured OPEC and Russia that its ability to meet demand was under control, according to Saudi and OPEC officials. The kingdom is concerned producers such as Iraq and Nigeria, which were recently persuaded to comply with OPEC\u2019s production cuts, may now renege on their plans, said a Saudi oil adviser.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want others to come out of the box. Otherwise they won\u2019t come back in,\u201d said the adviser.\n\nSaudi officials said they still believe they can fully replace its sidelined production in coming days. That would require tapping oil inventories and using other facilities to process crude.\n\nWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com", "description": "OPEC and Russia are so far holding off pumping more oil to fill potential gaps in global supplies after an attack in Saudi Arabia over the weekend led to a major crude disruption, officials said.", "authors": ["Benoit Faucon In London", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Georgi Kantchev In Moscow", "Benoit Faucon", "Summer Said", "Georgi Kantchev", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Georgi.Kantchev Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107365/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
