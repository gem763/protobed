This year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that there had been no less than a 300% year-on-year increase in the number of IT failures reported by financial firms.\n\nAnd the past few years have seen major banks regularly making headlines for outages that left online bankers locked out of their accounts. One of the worst failures happened in 2012, when a software update resulted in 6.5 million customers being unable to get accurate balances for their accounts at RBS, which landed the firm a hefty \u00a356 million fine.\n\nSince then, Visa saw 5.2 million transactions hit by a service outage in 2018; the same year, millions of Barclays customers were unable to access their accounts following a technical glitch.\n\nIt was the same year that TSB's computer failure caused 1.9 million people to lose access to online banking services. This cost the bank an estimated \u00a3330 million and 80,000 customers.\n\nSteve Baker, the Committee's lead member for the most recent report, said: \"The number of IT failures that have occurred in the financial services sector, including TSB, Visa and Barclays, and the harm caused to consumers is unacceptable.\"\n\nWhat it found was largely an industry that does not seem prepared for the technological requirements of the digital age.\n\nAmong the common causes of incidents, for example, it was found that legacy IT infrastructure is not systematically upgraded to meet new customer expectations; that cyber risk is the fourth most common cause of incidents; and that 20% of failures were a result of firms' overconfidence in their ability to manage IT changes.\n\nWhat the report also showed was that, on a management level, financial companies are failing to hold individuals accountable for outages.\n\nThe senior managers regime (SMR), which was put in place following the crash in 2007, holds senior staff accountable for financial operations \u2013 but when it comes to financial infrastructure, which in turn determines the efficiency of an IT system, the distribution of responsibility is not as straightforward.\n\nAs a result, the report highlighted, there has to this date never been a successful enforcement case against an individual following an IT failure.\n\nSEE: Digital transformation: How one bank is using AI, big data and chatbots to create new services\n\nDavid Bailey, executive director at the Bank of England, said: \"We do not have the same senior managers regime applicable to financial market infrastructure. It is an area where accountability in the firms that I supervise could be enhanced\".\n\nBut it is ultimately the way that companies handle the crisis once it is already underway that was most heavily condemned by the Treasury Committee. Baker pointed the finger at \"the hollow words\" that \"for too long\" have been issued by financial institutions after their systems fail.\n\nTSB, for example, claimed that \"the vast majority\" of its customers were able to access their online accounts shortly after its computers failed \u2013 when in fact the successful log-in rate was only 50%.\n\nAs much as banks are to blame for their negligence, however, the report noted that change needs to happen at the level of regulators \u2013 that is the FCA, but also the Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).\n\nFor example, expanding the SMR to financial infrastructure to increase accountability is within the competence of regulatory bodies and not individual companies. Or regulators could increase levies to ensure banks have enough staff, resolve complaints and award compensation rapidly.\n\n\"To ensure accountability for failures, regulators must have teeth and be seen to have teeth\", the Committee said.", "description": "The Treasury Committee's latest report shows that banks are not prepared for the technical challenges of online banking \u2013 and their IT shortcomings have made for \"unacceptable\" customer service.", "authors": ["Daphne Leprince-Ringuet"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/69be301e-e762-430c-b045-27ec28c21696/thumbnail/770x578/4dbae58b8fd666c81ead717b359fb2b7/istock-1126621519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
