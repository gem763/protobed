Pictures from 1991 show men, women and children carrying their possessions, gathering firewood and burying their dead in a refugee camp in Cukurca, Turkey, just across the border from Iraq. They had escaped a military operation by Saddam's government aimed at \"Arabising\" Kurdish areas in the north. Hundreds of thousands fled into Turkey and Iran.\n\nNow, once again, the Kurds \u2014 as many as 30 million people spread through Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, but with no state of their own \u2014 are on the move. Usually far from the headlines, whole families have trekked away from danger. Since the fall of Saddam, the Kurds' semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq became, until the Islamic State offensive that started in Iraq in June and turned against the Kurds in August, a haven of relative peace in a war-ravaged country.\n\nThe attacks by the militants \u2014 who are notorious for killing anyone who refuses to convert to their austere version of Sunni Islam \u2014 created a new wave of refugees, from Iraq and Syria. Most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, but tend to feel more loyalty to their Kurdishness, rather than their religion.\n\nReuters pictures taken in a refugee camp in Suruc, Turkey in recent months show familiar scenes - a line of people stretches into the distance as they walk from their homes in Kobani, across the border in Syria, where Islamic State has besieged the town. The battle for Kobani has become a focal point, not just for the plight of the Kurds, but of the West's confrontation with global Islamist militancy.", "description": "Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds in the 1980s was cited by Western powers as one of the justifications for the 2003 invasion that toppled him.", "authors": ["Srdjan Zivulovic"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQwzt-pH_41ZugujuLektplOD1KBrJKKBAtE2crret00fF5wUofr2AF1ddOuEXNu_LvwQZaUsu8aMDNQRhghZ6s7w4KMEBVG4CMKwoWMkJ9Kq"}
