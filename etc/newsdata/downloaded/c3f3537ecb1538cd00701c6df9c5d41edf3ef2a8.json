Tim Elliott via submission (guillotine choke) \u2013 Round 1, 3:08\n\nUpdated records: Figueiredo (17-1 MMA, 6-1 UFC), Elliott (15-9-1 MMA, 4-7 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Elliott outstruck Figueiredo 33-8 and landed a takedown \u2013 but Figueiredo caught him in the guillotine to put the fight away.\n\nFigueiredo on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI knew he was going to try to take me down, and I trained a lot for the guillotine to submit him. When he tried to take me down, I got the guillotine.\u201d\n\nFigueiredo on criticism he held the choke too long\n\n\u201cThe excitement of the fight \u2013 when I saw the (referee stop it), I let it go. If the (ref) says to stop, I\u2019ll stop \u2013 and I did. It was the excitement of the fight.\u201d\n\nFigueiredo on what he wants next\n\n\u201cThe next one needs to be Benavidez. He was supposed to fight me last year. He thought I was afraid, but I was hurt and couldn\u2019t take the fight. Now I want Benavidez to pay for what he said. I want to knock him out so he can\u2019t talk trash again, I want people to see that he is a liar. Why wouldn\u2019t we do the interim belt now? Cejudo isn\u2019t going to come back until the middle of next year. Fight me for the interim belt now. I can go as soon as Benavidez wants. When is he ready? I am ready now. Next month, next year, whatever \u2013 I am ready. He can\u2019t be scared after what he said. Now is the time to prove who is afraid of who. This is the fight business, not the talk business, so let\u2019s fight.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Figueiredo, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Deiveson Figueiredo def.
