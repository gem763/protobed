Say It Ain\u2019t So, Hillary!", "language": "en", "text": "Can\u2019t blame her for wondering what went so very wrong. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nUntil quite recently, the preposterous idea of Hillary Clinton seeking a rematch with Donald Trump in 2020 was mostly a right-wing fantasy projection from people who loved the idea of beating her again (and perhaps imprisoning her in the bargain), wanted an excuse to continue their ludicrous conspiracy theories about her, or simply wanted to troll Democrats. Yes, once-upon-a-time Clinton adviser Mark Penn traded on his lost relationship with her to titillate his new conservative friends with HRC 2020 talk last year, but nobody should have taken his bad-faith word seriously. And nearly a year ago, one genuine Clinton intimate, Philippe Reines, let it be known that while it was very unlikely, there was a remote chance she might be interested in a comeback:\n\nWhen pressed on whether she\u2019s running, Reines told Politico: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero, but it\u2019s not zero.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month HRC\u2019s name started coming up again in conjunction with probably exaggerated reports of big-money donor panic over the weak \u201ccentrist\u201d bench in the Democratic presidential field. But the Washington Post reported that \u201caccording to two people close to her, [HRC] has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction.\u201d\n\nAnd now, in a move designed to make sure conservatives don\u2019t forget their own HRC 2020 dream world, Reines did something to keep the speculation alive:\n\nPhilippe Reines went on Tucker Carlson's show last night and said Hillary Clinton had not ruled out a 2020 bid for the presidency. \"This is a huge if,\" he says, adding it is \"unlikely.\" Carlson adds: \"She's become like the most reasonable person in the Democratic Party.\" \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) October 24, 2019\n\nSpeaking of \u201cunlikely\u201d: That\u2019s the word I\u2019d use for the possibility that Reines chose to say this particular thing in that particular venue without prior approval from Clinton.\n\nNow as I\u2019ve said before, Hillary Clinton\u2019s service to her country and her party mean she is entitled to say and do any damn thing she wants with her life and career going forward. But she of all people should grasp how very bad an idea this is, and scotch it once and for all. Yes, it\u2019s understandable that she would want to \u201credo\u201d that disastrous 2016 campaign. But that is precisely what Democrats from every faction of the party and every perspective on politics do not want to do.\n\nIn no small part that\u2019s because we may never completely figure out how and why the Bad Man did the Bad Things and won anyway. There are so many theories, ranging from Russian interference to post-Obama racism to financial and mechanical mistakes by the Clinton campaign to her long exposure as an \u201cEstablishment\u201d figure to revenge by the Bernie people. Personally, I think sheer complacency and protest voting (and nonvoting) by people who couldn\u2019t imagine a monstrous figure like Trump winning were the X factor. But the fact remains that HRC cannot go back and fix one thing and make the nightmare go away, for her, for Democrats, or for America. So clearly someone else needs to pick up the banner and keep the next four years from being like the years we are living through right now.\n\nPanicky donor whining notwithstanding, Democrats have a record number of options for doing just that. They offer a wide range of policy views, records, theories of change, personalities and identities. And while one may worry about this or that candidate underperforming during the \u201cinvisible primary,\u201d nobody still in the race has been eliminated yet. All the leading Democratic candidates are routinely trouncing Trump in general-election trial heats; his job approval rating is perpetually stalled in an area that usually means defeat; and half the electorate wants to run him out of Washington without even waiting for the opportunity to eject him at the polls. Why are any Democrats in the sort of despair that might support a recourse to HRC?\n\nIt\u2019s far too early for panic, but it\u2019s probably not too early to conclude that the current field isn\u2019t going to be displaced by some late entry. How, exactly, is Hillary Clinton supposed to win the nomination? Will she rebuild an Iowa organization even though all her old staff and supporters have moved on to other candidacies? Can she push aside Joe Biden? Would supporters of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders really look to her for inspiration and salvation? Perhaps the idea is that the convention in Milwaukee will be deadlocked and will then turn to the 2016 nominee. How likely is that, as opposed to a coalition ticket? And if a retread somehow seems appropriate, why not John Kerry, who also narrowly lost but did not lose to Donald J. Trump?\n\nPlease, Ms. Clinton, don\u2019t keep this right-wing fantasy in play, and don\u2019t make admirers (like me) have to recite the reasons you should not run for president in 2020. If you want to have an impact, endorse someone who is already running, or help the party in other ways. You\u2019d done what you can to expose the terrible future Trump represents for America and its most vulnerable people. Let someone else change that future for good.", "description": "Talk of Hillary Clinton running for president in 2020 is a persistent fantasy topic in right-wing media, but it won\u2019t go away unless she makes it clear it\u2019s not happening, and that Democrats have plenty of resources and candidates to beat Trump.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/shows/24-hilary-clinton.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
