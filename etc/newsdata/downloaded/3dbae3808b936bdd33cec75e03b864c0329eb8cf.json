The constitutional court in Rome ruled in the case of a defendant who brought a friend, a well-known Italian DJ who was left quadriplegic by an accident, to Switzerland to die in an assisted suicide clinic.\n\nRusso said \"such a strong ruling\" should not precede action by the parliament.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
