After falling 5.5% last week, WTI Crude futures closed down 0.3% at $52.46 yesterday, and Brent Crude was off a similar 0.3%, closing at $59.07.\n\nThe reason, unfortunately, is not that the Middle East has suddenly become a safer place to do business. It hasn't, with a new border war due to break out along the Iraq-Turkey border any day now, and a Saudi response to Iran's (alleged) strike against its oil facilities still pending. Instead, market participants are becoming more anxious about the next round of U.S.-China trade talks later this week, and what a failure of the two superpowers to reach an accommodation might mean for the global economy.\n\nNaturally, worries like these are pushing the price of oil stocks down in tandem with oil prices. For example, independent oil and gas exploration and production company Pioneer Natural Resources has lost 16% of its value since the September 16 attacks. Another independent producer, CNX Resources, has lost 20%, while yet a third, WPX Energy, is down 21%.\n\nBut here's the good news: According to the consensus of Wall Street analysts, all three of these stocks could go back up -- as much as 30%. Let's take a closer look:\n\nCNX Resources (CNX)\n\nThe most heavily leveraged of these three \"strong buy\" rated oil stocks, CNX Resources boasts a $1.3 billion market capitalization ... and $2.8 billion in debt.\n\nDespite all the debt, CNX Resources is a profitable operation, generating more than $300 million in net profit over the last 12 months -- enough to give the stock a trailing P/E ratio of just over 4.2. The stock is not free cash flow positive, however, burning through more than $250 million in cash over the last 12 months.\n\nStill, in a note recommending the stock, Jefferies analyst Zach Parham predicted that \"a more capital efficient budget than expected in 2020,\" combined with plans to \"hold production flat in 2021\" hold out the prospect for CNX generating positive free cash flow in the near future -- which would provide cash CNX could use to pare its debt load.\n\nParham predicts the stock could close out this year with about $85 million in free cash flow -- and grow that number by nearly half, to perhaps $110 million, in 2021. With a $10 price target on the stock, the analyst believes the stock can rise about 40% over the next 12 months. (To watch Parham's track record, click here)\n\n\"CNX remains one of only two Buy rated gassy E&Ps (along with COG), as we believe CNX can generate growth and FCF in 2020, while also having the potential to bring forward value through asset sales (CNXM GP, CNXM units, remaining midstream assets, CBM, etc),\" the analyst concluded.\n\nHow does Parham's bullish bet weigh in against the Street? It appears the analyst is not the only one enthusiastic on this oil stock, with TipRanks analytics demonstrating CNX as a Strong Buy. Out of 3 analysts polled in the last 3 months, all 3 are bullish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 36%, the stock\u2019s consensus target price stands at $9.67. (See CNX stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nCNX price target More\n\nWPX Energy (WPX)\n\nNext on our list today is another three-lettered oil company: WPX. Like CNX, it's a debt-laden company with strong GAAP profits but no free cash flow to speak of -- in fact, WPX burned through nearly a half-billion dollars in cash over the last year. But with a $4.1 billion market capitalization, WPX is a bit bigger, and perhaps a bit better able to manage its debt -- which at $2.1 billion net of cash, is actually a bit lighter than what CNX is carrying around.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Oil prices continued their near-month-long, post-September 16, post-Saudi Arabian drone attack slide on Tuesday.
