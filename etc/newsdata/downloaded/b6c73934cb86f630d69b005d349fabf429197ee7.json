Dallas avoided a four-game skid to open a season that would've matched a franchise worst.\n\nRadulov scored in the third period and Nick Caamano had the first of his NHL career to help erase a 2-1 deficit. The Stars bounced back from Nicklas Backstrom's tying goal with 30 seconds left in regulation.\n\nDallas goaltender Ben Bishop stopped 29 of the 32 shots he faced, and Roope Hintz scored his fourth goal in as many games. Washington's Braden Holtby made 22 saves on 26 shots.\n\nCapitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov scored less than five minutes into his season debut after being suspended the first three games for inappropriate conduct. Defenseman John Carlson also scored for Washington, which has lost back-to-back games in overtime.\n\nThe Stars outshot the Capitals 12-5 in the third period and survived another game coming up empty on the power play. They're 0 for 10 this season.\n\nBut Dallas goes home on a winning note thanks to Seguin's second goal of the season.\n\nNOTES: Winger Denis Gurianov was a healthy scratch not long after being on the Stars' top line. ... Dallas winger Corey Perry skated for the second time since breaking his left foot. Coach Jim Montgomery said Perry would be re-evaluated later this week. ... Kuznetsov's return put the Capitals into a salary cap bind that forced them to send defenseman Martin Fehervary to the minors and play Tyler Lewington. ... Center Nic Dowd was a healthy scratch for the Capitals. .... These teams meet for the second and final time this season Saturday in Dallas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nStars: Return home from their road trip to face the Calgary Flames on Thursday.\n\nCapitals: Open a two-game road trip Thursday at the Nashville Predators.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
