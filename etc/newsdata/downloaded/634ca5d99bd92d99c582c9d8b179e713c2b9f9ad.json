Since then, he has spent more time in Silicon Valley, first bringing Chinese entrepreneurs over to connect with their American peers, then investing in early-stage startups through ZhenFund, a venture capital firm he co-founded in collaboration with Sequoia Capital China.\n\nIn its eight years, ZhenFund has developed a portfolio of 700 companies, including China\u2019s popular e-commerce app RED and Virgin Hyperloop One. Last year alone, it invested $229 million in 14 American startups.\n\nBut the fund is putting a stop on its U.S. investments \u2014 a decision prompted by the increasing scrutiny of Chinese investments in the U.S. and the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) reform.\n\nZGC, China's state-backed VC, runs an Innovation Center in Santa Clara, California.

We do not currently have nor foresee having any future strategies related to investing in the United States,\u201d ZhenFund said in a statement. \u201cOur previous overseas investments have focused mainly on Chinese entrepreneurs who have studied or worked abroad, or whose products target the Chinese market.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration dramatically expanded the scope of its CFIUS review program in November 2018, subjecting companies to a mandatory review process that was once voluntary. For the first time, the program extended to minority investments and placed extra scrutiny on foreign investments in emerging technology, especially those from China. That resulted in a lengthy, 45-day review period with processing fees, creating additional strains for foreign investors.\n\n\u201cBasically, that makes investment impossible,\u201d said Jiang Wei, a former U.S.-based partner of ZhenFund and founder of Momentor Ventures, speaking at the China Institute in New York in September. \u201cBecause no good deals could wait for 45 working days. Just really bad deals could wait, but we don't want to invest anyway.\u201d\n\nChinese VC investment in the U.S. drops in 2019. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance) More\n\nZhenFund\u2019s fate illustrates the increasing challenges Chinese investors face as they navigate the political hazards that come with seeking investment opportunities in the U.S, in the midst of a trade war between Washington and Beijing. While the Trump administration may be considering potential limits to investment flows between the two countries, investment data suggests the flows have already dried up. Last year, Chinese VC funds invested $14.8 billion in U.S.-based startups, a record total. In the first nine months of this year, that number was slashed by two-thirds, according to data compiled by PitchBook.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to attract any more attention. They\u2019re not going to come out and declare, \u2018hey we\u2019re shutting down,\u201d said Edith Yeung, co-founder of VC fund Proof of Capital. \u201cThe reality is, that I don\u2019t see [Chinese funds] doing any activities in the U.S. last year at all. My interpretation is, basically, they gave up.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "The White House may be considering ways to limit Chinese investment, but those who used to come to Silicon Valley have already retreated.", "authors": ["Krystal Hu", "Akiko Fujita"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PvEfcneQbaTDd6REp.X3Qg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/18368cf0-ec39-11e9-ab9f-558b4ed7e5cc", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
