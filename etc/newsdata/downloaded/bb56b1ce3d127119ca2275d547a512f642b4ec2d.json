As he describes it: \"I'm going to do it in black and white and I'm going to get really really close to my subjects. Nothing else \u2014 white background, just the person, very stoic, very poetic emotions. There's more beyond that.\"\n\nWhy is Gonzalo focusing so closely on the faces he's photographing? He's zeroing in on what is often referred to in Filipinx culture as \"bakla\" culture \u2014 that is, people assigned male at birth who identify as queer, gay or trans. They have been a strong presence in Filipinx culture, but as Gonzalo points out, \"Especially in television, we always have the bakla as the gay best friend, the flamboyant one.\"\n\nWatch the video:\n\nPhotographer Ally Gonzalo opens up about the word \"bakla\" and what it means to queer Filipinx people. Filmmaker: Jim Agapito, Ryan Nash, Paul Stabell, Matt Purchase, and Aleksandra Osipova 7:43\n\nIn this video made by filmmakers Jim Agapito, Ryan Nash, Paul Stabell, Matt Purchase, and Aleksandra Osipova, Gonzalo takes you inside his Bakla! series of portraits, commissioned for CBC Arts and CBC Manitoba as part of CBC's Creator Network. You'll hear the stories \u2014 from the triumphant to the tearjerking \u2014 of bakla folks about coming out to their families and friends and settling into their own skin and identity. And you'll hear about the relationship Gonzalo himself has had with the term \"bakla.\"\n\nAlly Gonzalo's Bakla! series premiered on September 13. You can read more about it from Gonzalo himself in this CBC Manitoba article.
