Iran is suffering from our sanctions but does not want to escalate into an active war with us,\u201d Andrew Lewis, a former Defense Department staffer and the president of a private intelligence firm, the Ulysses Group, told Fox News. \u201cThey can do a lot to manipulate the world economy, which will have a negative impact on the U.S. and our allies in Europe.\u201d\n\nAccording to one well-placed U.S. defense source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, \u201call options\u201d have been on the table when it comes to deciphering the next steps and officials were discussing \u201cappropriate\u201d tactical responses.\n\n\u201cThe administration could inflict some serious pain. The question becomes, does the President preemptively launch? Or wait until next week when the United Nations Security Council has a meeting? There will be a response,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe Iranians know we know they did it or at least had material support to it. The American public cares about how much they pay at the gas pump.\u201d\n\nINSIDE IRAN\u2019S DEADLY ARMORY AND ITS CAPABILITIES TO FIGHT THE U.S.\n\nPresident Trump cautioned on Sunday that the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification\u201d and waiting to identify the mastermind, hinting at Tehran\u2019s culpability.\n\n\u201cTrump has actually proven pretty reluctant to use force. We saw this earlier play out in the U-turn on the mission planned in response to the downing of our drone,\u201d noted Brett Bruen, a former U.S. diplomat who served as a director of global engagement at the White House. \u201cThe more likely scenario is similar to what happened with [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s] use of chemical weapons \u2013 launch a few missiles and call it a day. It will be seen by our allies as an appropriate, proportional response. It wouldn\u2019t preclude the possibility of talks.\u201d\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been at war with Saudi Arabia and its allies over control of the country\u2019s capital city, Sana\u2019a, were quick to claim responsibility for the air assault which sent stocks tumbling over 100 points in early trading Monday and spiked gasoline prices some 15 cents a gallon.\n\nBut, officials have been skeptical.\n\nSatellite photographs of the strike points \u2013 of which there were at least 17 \u2013 indicated that the vehicles originated from either Iran, Iraq, or the northern Persian Gulf rather than Yemen, on Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border.\n\nBaghdad has dismissed the possibility that the attacks stemmed from its terrain.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also lambasted the \u201cunprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d underscoring that there was \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d\n\nAnthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that while the Houthis were known to have acquired strike systems with the necessary range, the militia had \u201cno advanced technology base\u201d and was \u201cdependent on imported missiles\u201d and other drone technologies for attacks.\n\nThe Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs told Fox News in a statement on Thursday that \u201cinitial investigations have indicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian weapons,\u201d but investigations were ongoing to determine the source.\n\n\u201cThis attack is in line with the previous attacks against Saudi Aramco pumping stations using Iranian weapons. As the investigations are ongoing, the Kingdom will invite UN and international experts to view the situation on the ground and to participate in the investigations,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe Kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation to ensure its security and stability. The Kingdom affirms that it has the capability and resolve to defend its land and people, and to forcefully respond to these aggressions.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u200bAs with recent attacks on ships and oil facilities, investigators may never be able to conclusively determine its origin.\n\n\u201cThe United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper tweeted on Monday afternoon, announcing that he had briefed Trump on the situation after first speaking to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammary about the recent attack.\n\nFEARS U.S. WEAPONS ARE FALLING INTO THE 'WRONG HANDS' DURING CHAOTIC YEMEN WAR\n\nIran vehemently has denied accusations that it executed the drone assault. Some analysts \u2013 citing previous attacks over the summer, one in which involved Iran allegedly downed a $125 million U.S. surveillance drone over international waters \u2013 said the rogue nation was operating on a policy of plausible deniability.\n\nNonetheless, Brigadier-General Amir Ali Hajizadeh of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps said \u2013 as Al Jazeera reported \u2013 that they were ready for \u201cfull-scale war.\u201d\n\nAnd, if the Houthis are proven to have played a prominent role \u2013 even at the behest of their Iranian backers \u2013 it could send the country\u2019s protracted conflict and humanitarian disaster into a whole new level of devastation.\n\n\u201cThe recent military escalation is extremely worrying,\u201d the UN Special Envoy for Yemen\u2019s Office responded. \u201cThe Special Envoy urges all parties to prevent such further incidents, which pose a serious threat to regional security, complicate the already fragile situation and jeopardize UN-led political process.\u201d\n\nAs for the next steps, defense analyst John Wood anticipated that Washington will allow Saudi Arabia to take the lead.\n\n\u201cIt was the Kingdom that was attacked, and it is the Kingdom with the most to lose. The attack clearly shows how weak and desperate Iran has become, and with more sanctions, is likely to come,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, the situation is quite manageable. However, if one side or the other should decide to cripple the other oil\u2019s infrastructure, there will be a war that will engulf the whole Middle East.\u201d\n\nSuch a hypothetical war, experts contended, could spark a crisis for the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cIt's important to remember that Saudi Arabia was attacked, not the United States. For that reason, the president has no authority to launch strikes without congressional authorization,\u201d Benjamin Friedman, a policy director of Defense Priorities, contended. \u201cNo matter what, Washington should not use the U.S. military to clean up Saudi Arabia's mess, but the odds of that happening are much too likely. Presumably, all options are on the table, but military options are likely to create escalation far more damaging than Saturday's attacks.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoreover, Joseph Duggan, a geopolitical consultant who worked as a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, in the State Department for President Ronald Reagan, and in Saudi Arabia for six years at Aramco headquarters, cautioned that the perpetrators of the attack sought to \u201cprovoke a United States president and Congress into hasty and costly intervention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won the Cold War by resisting the temptation to go to war when there were flashpoints such as this. We are much stronger than Iran,\u201d Duggan added. \u201cWe should refuse to take the bait of answering a spectacular attack with a showy gesture that is not strategically sound. We need to operate steadily, and usually covertly, to degrade their ability to harm our allies and our interests.\u201d", "description": "As the plumes of smoke settle over two of Saudi Arabia\u2019s critical oil production facilities \u2013 which came under crippling drone strikes over the weekend \u2013 both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are deliberating options for retaliation, raising the possibility of much broader instability across the region, although President Trump was quick to point out Monday, \u201c\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bI don't want war with anybody.\u201d", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
