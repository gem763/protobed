Quebec led the gains with more than a third of the value, while six other provinces reported increases, the agency said.\n\n\u201cOn the residential side, the number of units came in at 247,000 annualized in the month, flagging continued strength in housing starts down the road,\u201d wrote Robert Kavcic, senior economist, at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cIndeed, the year-to-date average for permits is a lofty 237k, so it looks like there\u2019s plenty in the pipeline to keep residential construction activity humming.\u201d\n\nHousing starts were solid but on fell 2.5 per cent in September on an annualized basis to 221,202 from 226,871 in the previous month, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.\n\nSingle-detached starts fell by 8 per cent to 58,600 units during the month, but remain above the trough posted earlier in the year. Meanwhile, multi-unit starts were flat at 162,000 units.\n\n\u201cSeptember\u2019s outturn caps a strong third quarter for new housing construction which, alongside a probable increase in home sales, points to a healthy gain in residential investment,\u201d noted TD Canada economist Rishi Sondhi.\n\nCIBC Capital Markets\u2019 Avery Shenfeld was less impressed.\n\n\u201cOverall, while we could get some growth from real estate agents fees and renovations, the pop in GDP growth we got from housing in Q2 is likely to be be less vigorous in the next couple of quarters,\u201d the economist said.\n\nCombined, the two sets of data reflect strong demographic demand, both from international inflows and new households created within Canada, Kavcic said.\n\n\u201cThat was somewhat stronger than expected and continues the relentless level of building activity.\u201d\n\nOntario, which needs \u201cevery last unit at this point,\u201d according to Kavcic, and B.C. lead the boom fuelled by population inflows and resilient economies.\n\nConstruction activity in B.C. has mostly maintained its drive despite a correction in the number of resold houses and a fall in prices after the government imposed tighter mortgage and foreign ownership rules, analysts noted.\n\nThe CMHC and StatsCan reports \u201cprovide further evidence of strength returning to the housing market after it went into a deep freeze following the introduction of a mortgage stress test and other measures,\u201d Nikita Perevalov, senior economist at Scotibank Economics in Toronto, said in a note.\n\nB.C. led the gains in the value of permits for multi-family dwellings, mostly because of high property values in Vancouver, StatsCan said. Ontario led single-family dwelling permit increases. Overall, the value of residential permits grew 19 per cent to $3.3 billion in August from July.\n\nHousing starts in Vancouver grew 23 per cent year-to-date compared with last year, CMHC said, because of the \u201ccontinuous strengthening of economic fundamentals.\u201d More than 85 per cent of construction was in multi-unit buildings, it said.\n\nEdmonton\u2019s housing starts trended upwards for the fourth consecutive month in September, driven by the multi-family market and despite elevated inventories, CMHC said.\n\nSeptember housing starts were higher in Saskatoon because of condominium construction, but the year-to-date numbers were still down 10 per cent compared with last year, the agency said.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of homebuilding activity going on across the vast majority of Canada Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets\n\nIn Toronto, the starts trends for semi-detached and townhomes were particularly strong, CMHC said, indicating how these relatively affordable housing types remain popular among buyers.\n\nOttawa\u2019s housing starts are up 11 per cent year-to-date compared with last year as strong growth in apartment and row houses reflected how higher prices for single-family dwellings are pushing buyers to less expensive housing types, CMHC said.\n\nAlthough housing starts in Quebec fell last month, the 12-month average is still at a nine-year high because of a strong economy, job market and increasing foreign investment, Kavcic said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of homebuilding activity going on across the vast majority of Canada,\u201d Kavcic said. \u201cIf firm rent growth and low vacancies are any guide (in most markets not tied to oil), the demographic backdrop warrants such activity.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Ontario \u2014 which needs 'every last unit at this point' \u2014 and B.C. lead the boom fuelled by population inflows and resilient economies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/building_permits.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
