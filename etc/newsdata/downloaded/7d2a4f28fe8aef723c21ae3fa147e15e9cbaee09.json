The prime minister immediately said he would call for a new general election.\n\nThe 328 to 301 vote cleared the way for Johnson's opponents to introduce a bill Wednesday that would prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal October 31.\n\nThe cross-party rebels are determined to prevent a \"no-deal\" Brexit because of fears it would gravely damage the economy, and the vote came hours after Johnson suffered key defections from his party, losing a working majority in Parliament.\n\nOn a day of high drama and acerbic debate in the House of Commons, lawmakers returned from their summer recess to confront Johnson over his insistence that the U.K. leave the European Union on October 31, even without a withdrawal agreement to cushion the economic blow.

Former Cabinet minister Justine Greening and former Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt also signaled their intention to stand down.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, lambasted the weakened Johnson and accused him of \"riding roughshod\" over the constitution in order to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal.\n\n\"He isn't winning friends in Europe. He's losing friends at home. His is a government with no mandate, no morals and, as of today, no majority,\" Corbyn said.", "description": "The 328 to 301 vote cleared the way for Boris Johnson's opponents to introduce a bill Wednesday that would prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal October 31", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/882ea222-9a12-430e-9433-a0cb5a0813c9/thumbnail/1200x630/4228e61c86787758132bd3c57be3ea4f/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson.jpg"}
