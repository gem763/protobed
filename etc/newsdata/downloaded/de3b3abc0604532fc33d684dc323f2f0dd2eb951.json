I found a great partner from a USC business school guy who also worked in the beer business\u2026and we timed it because we knew we had some things coming out, like a little thing in a month.\u201d\n\nSchraderbr\u00e4u case More\n\nThe actor is hinting at the highly anticipated Breaking Bad film coming to Netflix (NFLX), which released a trailer earlier this month.\n\nNorris is not the first to see the possibilities in capitalizing on a fanbase. In October of 2017 and February of 2018, McDonald\u2019s (MCD) brought back a limited amount of its Szechuan sauce after the Disney\u2019s Mulan-inspired dip was referenced in an episode of Adult Swim\u2019s \u201cRick and Morty\u201d. More recently, Coca-Cola (KO) brought back New Coke in honor of the latest season of the Netflix series \u201cStranger Things\u201d. Norris is looking to do something that\u2019s more than temporary with his product.\n\nThe Netflix logo is seen on a phone in this photo illustration in Washington, DC, on July 10, 2019.

We knew we could bring a lot of people to the beer with the name, so we wanted to make sure it was a quality beer\u2026.We partnered with this brewery in Buellton, California that\u2019s rather famous for making German style lagers. They had the capacity that they could do our beers well.\u201d\n\nThe beer is available to purchase in a limited number of Cotsco\u2019s (COST), and online, and soon to be in Canada.\n\nDevin Southard is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Breaking bad actor Dean Norris has taken the fictional beer Schraderbr\u00e4u, the mythological homebrew from Norris\u2019 beloved character Hank Schrader, and made it a reality.", "authors": ["Devin Southard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vtSCImoNkzXomTw47b78Rg--~B/aD0xMDQ5O3c9MTMyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/71d75870-d74e-11e9-9ccb-603b03fed457", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
