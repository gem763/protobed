A meaty stew, say, won\u2019t really cut it on the adaptability stakes, while the consequences of reheating meat repeatedly over the course of the week really don\u2019t bear thinking about, so I guess we\u2019re looking to vegetables and pulses as our saviours here. (That said, stock is another matter entirely, and can be used in soups, pasta and rice dishes, braises or as a poaching medium.)\n\nStep forward one of our queens of common-sense cookery, Rosie Sykes, whose books, The Kitchen Revolution and The Sunday Night Book, feature all kinds of get-ahead smarts (as does her third book, Roasting Pan Suppers, which is published next spring): \u201cThe holy grail,\u201d she says, \u201cis a base that can easily be tweaked into very distinct meals day by day.\u201d\n\nBrown lentils are as good a starting point as any, she says. \u201cMake a big batch with a few flavourings \u2013 olive oil, chopped onion, garlic and seasoning \u2013 pop them in the fridge and you\u2019ve got yourself a brilliant template to work from.\u201d Variations on the theme are almost endless, Sykes explains. Stir a portion of the lentil mix into a mirepoix \u2013 that is, leek, celery and carrot fried in butter or oil \u2013 then top with goat\u2019s cheese, grilled fish or a lamb chop or two, and douse in salsa verde. Or stir in some pesto and eat with crusty bread. \u201cOr make this amazing stew I had in Italy last summer, with caramelised onions, pancetta [or bacon], chilli flakes, a big handful of chopped cooked chestnuts, red-wine vinegar and parsley \u2013 it\u2019s lovely just as it is, but it\u2019d work with sausages or fried halloumi, too.\u201d Or spice things up by stirring in fried ginger and garlic, cumin, coriander, spinach, chilli and maybe a dash of coconut milk, and transform those lentils into a quick curry to eat with naan or rice. Or use them to bulk up mince in a shepherd\u2019s pie topped with root veg or potato mash. Or \u2026 well, you get the picture.\n\nSquash is another Sykes go-to on the batch-cooking front. \u201cYou could do similar with roast mixed root veg \u2013 carrot, celeriac, parsnip, turnip \u2013 but for me squash is so much more multi-faceted.\u201d Like her lentils, the base couldn\u2019t be simpler: peel a squash \u2013 \u201cCrown prince is ideal, because it\u2019s so big and gives you more bang for your buck\u201d \u2013 season and roast with sliced red onion and lemon before chopping into cubes and refrigerating. The roast squash is now \u201cyour door to a world of dishes\u201d, says Sykes, who then proceeds to prove it.\n\nGo French, she suggests, with a warm, autumnal salad of walnuts, chopped fried bacon and maybe some bitter roast radicchio, with the squash gently reheated in a low oven. Or go Italian and stir some squash into a risotto with crisp fried sage leaves to finish. Or head to Spain and mix it into butter beans, fried leeks, tinned tomatoes and a chopped-up pear \u2013 \u201cIt adds gorgeous little chunks of sweetness to every mouthful\u201d \u2013 and strew with a scattering of chopped almonds and garlic. Or give that pumpkin a north-African twist, and make harira with cooked chickpeas and lentils, a handful of rice, chicken or vegetable stock, ground cumin and ginger, coriander and chilli, all topped with a coriander and ginger paste.\n\n\u201cAs the week progresses,\u201d Sykes says, \u201cthe pumpkin will soften up a bit in the fridge, so bear that in mind when menu-planning.\u201d To that end, she suggests blitzing it to a thick puree after three or four days, perhaps with a little tahini, and reheating it gently with loads of spices and fresh herbs in a soup, or add harissa and a spritz of lemon, too, and you have a spicy warm dip for flatbreads. So, Aimee, forget Halloween: when you p-p-pick up a pumpkin, there\u2019s so much more to enjoy.\n\n\u2022 Got a culinary dilemma?
