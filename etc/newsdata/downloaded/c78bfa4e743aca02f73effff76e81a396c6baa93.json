Durant was able to get some shots in at the pop-a-shot even though he is still rehabbing from a ruptured Achilles tendon, which he suffered in the playoffs.\n\nBROOKLYN NETS' KYRIE IRVING REVEALS DEATH OF GRANDFATHER WEIGHED HEAVILY ON HIM LAST SEASON\n\nDurant and Irving were introduced as members of the Nets for the first time last week.\n\nWhile rumors swirl of Durant potentially playing for the Nets in his first season, Brooklyn General Manager Sean Marks put the speculation to rest during the team\u2019s media day. Marks said he understands Durant would want to play, but the franchise is taking a \u201clong-term approach\u201d with him.\n\n\u201cHis rehab\u2019s going very well,\u201d Marks said, according to the New York Post. \u201cWith Kevin, I think what we\u2019re going to say is the expectations are that he\u2019ll be out for the year. We\u2019re not going to plan on him playing.\u201d\n\nNETS NOT PLANNING FOR DURANT TO PLAY THIS SEASON\n\nIrving also addressed the media last week and said the death of his grandfather weighed heavily on him during his final season with the Boston Celtics.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take the necessary steps to get counseling or get therapy or anything to deal with someone that close to me dying,\u201d he said. \u201cI never dealt with anyone like that. So, for me, I responded in ways that are uncharacteristic and, like I said, I had to acknowledge that fact.\u201d\n\nIrving said he wanted to re-sign with the Celtics but his home life \u201chas way higher precedence than the organization or anyone and I barely got a chance to talk to my grandfather before he passed, from playing basketball.\u201d He said he thought he could \u201cbattle through\u201d his struggles through the team.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cAnd I failed these guys in a sense that I didn\u2019t give them everything that I could have during that season, especially without the amount of pieces that we had,\u201d he said. \u201cMy relationship with them personally were great, but in terms of me being a leader in that environment and bringing everyone together, I failed.\u201d", "description": "Kevin Durant might be superhuman on the court but off the court, he appears to enjoy the same things mere mortals do \u2013 especially on his birthday.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
