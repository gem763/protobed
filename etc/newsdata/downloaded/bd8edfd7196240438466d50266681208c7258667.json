It's a great benefit when it comes to dealing directly with governments and contractors,\" Mr Stephens said.\n\n\"It can be daunting, for example there\u2019s [historic] issues with Indigenous people and government, so to have that there, that\u2019s gold.\u201d\n\nThe joint venture aims to provide all businesses with more commercial legal options, not just those run by Indigenous Australians.\n\nMr Cash thinks this will help the country's businesses in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDespite there being a number of ATSI lawyers who have come through law school, there\u2019s no cohort of Indigenous commercial lawyers. Part of this venture hopes to provide some role models,\" he said.\n\nThe ultimate goal is for Jaramer to thrive as a standalone commercial law firm.\n\n\u201cOur involvement is really about providing a jump start to get Jaramer operating as a firm that can stand on its own two feet,\" Mr Cash said.\n\n\"We have to crawl before we walk but it's looking promising; there's been some really good developments over the last three months.\"\n\nThese include gaining retainers for ongoing work and developing relationships with government bodies. Mr Mailman said the tax commissioner, for example, was \"very on board\".\n\nStatement from the heart\n\nNorton Rose is one of 18 law firms to sign onto the Uluru Statement from the Heart calling for the constitutional enshrinement of a First Nations Voice, which Mr Cash said was important alongside its \u201cpractical and tangible\u201d work with Jaramer.\n\n\u201cBusiness has a critical role to play [in Indigenous recognition] because we\u2019re not subject to elections and businesses are in a position to develop views of what we think is important in the communities we serve,\" he said.\n\n\"Businesses signing onto the statement sends a really positive message to the community generally that these are issues that are supported by business leaders.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers Bevan Mailman, a Bidjara man, and Brian Bero, a Meriam man, joined forces with Norton Rose Fulbright to launch Jaramer Legal last year, in response to a dearth of Indigenous commercial lawyers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7327%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_803%2C$y_251/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5d4b2d39da283c4315e5cb1d6eb19e6e86d9ec48", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
