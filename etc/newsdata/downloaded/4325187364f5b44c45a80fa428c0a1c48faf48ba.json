For generations, presidents have typically discussed those encounters in the most delicate of tones.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing I have to do, by far, much harder than the witch hunt, is signing letters to parents of soldiers that have been killed,\u201d President Trump said at the White House this month.\n\nBut in arguing that there must be an end to \u201cendless wars\u201d in Afghanistan and more recently in Syria, Trump has given graphic accounts of distraught widows and disfigured soldiers in terms rarely, if ever, heard from a president.\n\nTrump has particularly focused on describing the ceremony of transferring the flag-draped coffins of US soldiers killed overseas from the military cargo planes that have brought their remains home to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.\n\nIn his telling, it is a gut-wrenching ordeal, a scene of anguish from the families of the fallen that bolsters his determination to bring American soldiers home from overseas conflicts. The public shares that desire, according to one recent survey, which found that 46 percent of Americans believe that military intervention makes the country less safe, while just 27 percent believe the opposite.\n\nAll recent presidents have struggled with the cost of war, and how to speak publicly about it, and to many of his supporters, Trump is talking in authentic and admirably frank terms about a reality many Americans and Washington policy makers never confront.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s comments also offend some veterans and military experts. They say that solemn words about fallen heroes ring hollow from a president who received a Vietnam draft deferment and who has managed a dangerously chaotic foreign policy.\n\nOthers wince at the bluntness of Trump\u2019s accounts.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d said Andrew J. Bacevich, a retired Army colonel turned author and historian whose son was killed while serving in Iraq in 2007. \u201cThose are infinitely private and painful moments. And to have anyone presume to comment on that, I think is beyond reprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s politicizing casualties,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has paid two visits to Dover Air Force Base, according to a White House spokesman, but it is unclear whether he has actually witnessed such scenes himself, or is repeating accounts he has heard from the military officers he has encountered there.\n\nAt a recent rally in Minnesota, the president referred to a widow jumping \u201con top of the flowers,\u201d adding \u201cI\u2019ve seen this.\u201d But the coffins unloaded at Dover, known as transfer cases, are not adorned with flowers.\n\nVisiting Dover is a \u201ca very tough experience,\u201d he said at the rally, describing grieving families awaiting the return of their deceased sons or daughters with remarkable poise.\n\nDan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that supports a noninterventionist American foreign policy, called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201csome of the most powerful and most eloquent remarks of his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was very important that he take some time to remind the American people of the human toll of these endless wars,\u201d said Caldwell, a former Marine who served a tour of duty in Iraq. \u201cPolicy makers, especially here in Washington, D.C., need to understand that these wars have a real cost,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has also spoken increasingly often about his somber encounters with the wounded at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, which the White House spokesman said he had visited eight times.\n\nHe recently recalled meeting a soldier whose nose had been reconstructed from \u201ca thousand fragments,\u201d and recounted his awkward conversation.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018So where were you hurt?\u2019\u201d Trump asked the soldier, whom he did not name. \u201cHe said, \u2018My face, sir, was almost obliterated.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You have a better face than I do,\u2019\u201d Trump disclosed to nervous laughter in the room, before praising the skill of the man\u2019s surgeons.\n\nScott Corsaut, a Marine veteran and interim president of America\u2019s Gold Star Families, a support group for the families of people killed during active duty, said he sympathized with the emotional nature of Trump\u2019s interactions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be tough as a president, whether it\u2019s President Trump or President Obama, to greet the families. I just really feel that as a human being that\u2019s got to be a tough job,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers see little introspection on Trump\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cHaving a draft dodger come and lecture us about what service to the country means or [how] hard it is to lose troops in combat is hypocrisy at its worst,\u201d said Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, who served four tours in Iraq as a Marine. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. Fake piety is worse than none at all,\u201d added Moulton, who was briefly a Democratic candidate for president. \u201cHe\u2019s saying what he believes is politically popular.\u201d\n\nPeter D. Feaver, a scholar of civil-military relations at Duke University who served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, said that Trump may be haunted by his exemption from Vietnam service after a diagnosis of bone spurs that some evidence suggests was unfounded.\n\n\u201cSome presidents struggle with whether they have the moral authority to cause other people to risk their lives,\u201d Feaver said.\n\nTrump\u2019s past two predecessors, Bush and Barack Obama, each regularly visited Walter Reed to meet with service members wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bush was a pilot in the Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, but Obama, like his successor, did not serve in the military.\n\nBut Bush never visited Dover, despite the thousands of troops killed under his watch, although he met privately with the families of hundreds of lost soldiers in other locations. His White House, determined to maintain support for the war in Iraq, resisted pressure to allow cameras to film the return of bodies there.\n\nIn late 2009, as he weighed whether to send more troops into Afghanistan, Obama paid an unannounced midnight visit to Dover to greet a plane returning several Americans who had been killed there. The White House allowed a photographer to capture the scene, prompting conservatives to accuse Obama of exploiting a sacred ritual.", "description": "In arguing that there must be an end to \u201cendless wars\u201d in Afghanistan and more recently in Syria, President Trump has given graphic accounts of distraught widows and disfigured soldiers in terms rarely, if ever, heard from a president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJ2mwD.img?h=192&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=2604&y=356", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
