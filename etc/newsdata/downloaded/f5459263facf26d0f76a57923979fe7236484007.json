He achieved our nation's liberation. Ordinary people cannot do such things.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, China will present a similar, glorious rendering of its record to the world.\n\nThe country is staging one of its biggest ever military parades, a celebration of 70 years of Communist Party rule as pure, political triumph.\n\nBeijing will tremble to the thunder of tanks, missile launchers and 15,000 marching soldiers, a projection of national power, wealth and status watched over by the current Communist Party leader, President Xi Jinping, in Tiananmen Square.\n\nAn incomplete narrative of progress\n\nLike Mr Zhao's paper-cut portraits, we're not meant to focus on the many individual scars made in the course of China's modern history.\n\nIt is the end result that matters.\n\nImage copyright Xinhua/AFP Image caption Mao Zedong pronounces the dawn of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949\n\nAnd, on face value, the transformation has been extraordinary.\n\nOn 1 October 1949, Chairman Mao stood in Tiananmen Square urging a war-ravaged, semi-feudal state into a new era with a founding speech and a somewhat plodding parade that could muster only 17 planes for the flyby.\n\nThis week's parade, in contrast, will reportedly feature the world's longest range intercontinental nuclear missile and a supersonic spy-drone - the trophies of a prosperous, rising authoritarian superpower with a 400 million strong middle class.\n\nIt is a narrative of political and economic success that - while in large part true - is, of course, incomplete.\n\nNew visitors to China are often, rightly, awe-struck by the skyscraper-festooned, hi-tech megacities connected by brand new highways and the world's largest high-speed rail network.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Those in China's glittering cities may accept the trade-off of political freedom for economic growth\n\nThey see a rampant consumer society with the inhabitants enjoying the freedom and free time to shop for designer goods, to dine out and to surf the internet.\n\n\"How bad can it really be?\" the onlookers ask, reflecting on the negative headlines they've read about China back home.\n\nThe answer, as in all societies, is that it depends very much on who you are.\n\nMany of those in China's major cities, for example, who have benefited from this explosion of material wealth and opportunity, are genuinely grateful and loyal.\n\nIn exchange for stability and growth, they may well accept - or at least tolerate - the lack of political freedom and the censorship that feature so often in the foreign media.\n\nFor them the parade could be viewed as a fitting tribute to a national success story that mirrors their own.\n\nBut in the carving out of a new China, the knife has cut long and deep.\n\nThe dead, the jailed and the marginalised\n\nMao's man-made famine - a result of radical changes to agricultural systems - claimed tens of millions of lives and his Cultural Revolution killed hundreds of thousands more in a decade-long frenzy of violence and persecution, truths that are notably absent from Chinese textbooks.\n\nImage copyright Getty/Topical Image caption Tens of millions starved to death as under Mao, China radically restructured agriculture and society\n\nAfter his death, the demographically calamitous One Child Policy brutalised millions over a 40-year period.\n\nStill today, with its new Two Child Policy, the Party insists on violating that most intimate of rights - an individual's choice over her fertility.\n\nThe list is long, with each category adding many thousands, at least, to the toll of those damaged or destroyed by one-party rule.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Beijing still regulates how many children families can have\n\nThere are the victims of religious repression, of local government land-grabs and of corruption.\n\nThere are the tens of millions of migrant workers, the backbone of China's industrial success, who have long been shut out of the benefits of citizenship.\n\nA strict residential permit system continues to deny them and their families the right to education or healthcare where they work.\n\nAnd in recent years, there are the estimated one and a half million Muslims in China's western region of Xinjiang - Uighurs, Kazakhs and others - who have been placed in mass incarceration camps on the basis of their faith and ethnicity.\n\nChina continues to insist they are vocational schools, and that it is pioneering a new way of preventing domestic terrorism.\n\nThe stories of the dead, the jailed and the marginalised are always much more hidden than the stories of the assimilated and the successful.\n\nViewed from their perspective, the censorship of large parts of China's recent history is not simply part of a grand bargain to be exchanged for stability and prosperity.\n\nGetty Timeline of modern China 1949 Mao declares the founding of the People's Republic of China\n\n1966-76 Cultural Revolution brings social and political upheaval\n\n1977 Deng Xiaoping initiates major reforms of China's economy\n\n1989 Army crushes Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests\n\n2010 China becomes the world's second-largest economy\n\n2018Xi Jinping is cleared to be president for life\n\nIt is something that makes the silence of their suffering all the more difficult to penetrate.\n\nIt is the job of foreign journalists, of course, to try.\n\n'Falsified, faked and glorified'\n\nBut while censorship can shut people up, it cannot stop them remembering.\n\nProf Guo Yuhua, a sociologist at Beijing's Tsinghua University, is one of the few scholars left trying to record, via oral histories, some of the huge changes that have affected Chinese society over the past seven decades.\n\nHer books are banned, her communications monitored and her social media accounts are regularly deleted.\n\n\"For several generations people have received a history that has been falsified, faked, glorified and whitewashed,\" she tells me, despite having been warned not to talk to the foreign media ahead of the parade.\n\n\"I think it requires the entire nation to re-study and to reflect on history. Only if we do that can we ensure that these tragedies won't be repeated.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Can progress really be attributed to the leadership?\n\nA parade, she believes, that puts the Communist Party at the front and centre of the story, misses the real lesson, that China's progress only began after Mao, when the party loosened its grip a bit.\n\n\"People are born to strive for a better, happier and more respectful life, aren't they?\" she asks me.\n\n\"If they are provided with a tiny little space, they'll try to make a fortune and solve their survival problems. This shouldn't be attributed to the leadership.\"\n\n'Our happiness comes from hard work'\n\nAs if to prove the point about how the unsettled, censored pasts of authoritarian states continue to impact the present, the parade is for invited guests only.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mao's portrait will, as it always is, be watching over the events in Tiananmen Square\n\nAnother anniversary, of which Tiananmen Square is the centrepiece, is also being measured in multiples of 10 - it is 30 years since the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy protests that shook the foundations of Communist Party rule.\n\nThe troops will be marching down the same avenue on which the students were gunned down.\n\nThe risk of even a lone protester using the parade to mark a piece of history that has largely been wiped from the record is just too great.\n\nWith central Beijing sealed off, ordinary people in whose honour it is supposedly being held, can only watch it on TV.\n\nBack in his Tianjin apartment, Zhao Jingjia shows me the intricate detail of a series of scenes, each cut from a single piece of paper, depicting the \"Long March\", a time of hardship and setback for the Communist Party long before it eventually swept to power.\n\n\"Our happiness nowadays comes from hard work,\" he tells me.\n\nIt is a view that echoes that of the Chinese government which, like him, has at least acknowledged that Mao made mistakes while insisting they shouldn't be dwelt on.\n\n\"As for the 70 years of China, it's extraordinary,\" he says. \"It can be seen by all. Yesterday we sent two navigation satellites into space - all citizens can enjoy the convenience that these things bring us.\"", "description": "As China celebrates 70 years as a communist state, who has really won - and how much have some lost?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BC83/production/_108995284_6f21e1df-d42d-49c9-86ac-5aae0874ae63.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
