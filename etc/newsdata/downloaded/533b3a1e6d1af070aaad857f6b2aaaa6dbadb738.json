You don\u2019t see too much NBA-style back-and-forth in the NFL.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere\u2019s the timeline: Mayfield\u2019s Oklahoma Sooners beat Ohio State two years ago, Mayfield planted the OU flag at midfield of OSU\u2019s stadium, just about everyone at Ohio State got mad, then on Monday night former OSU star Bosa hit Mayfield during a blowout win and mimicked planting a flag plant after. It was funny.\n\nAnd Mayfield isn\u2019t the type to just let it go, so we got a pretty good retort on Wednesday.\n\nBaker Mayfield has a funny comment for Nick Bosa\n\nMayfield tried to take the high road. For a few seconds anyway.\n\n\u201cBosa\u2019s ... you know, good for him,\u201d Mayfield said.\n\nAnd then ...\n\n\u201cHe had it premeditated,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s been thinking about that obviously for two years now. That\u2019s a long time to think about that loss.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the video from Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer:\n\nSay what you will about Mayfield, but he keeps us entertained.\n\nMayfield can hold a grudge too\n\nStory continues\n\nThe funny thing is, Mayfield\u2019s initial flag-plant celebration was premeditated too. Rodger Sherman of The Ringer pointed out that after the 2017 game, Mayfield said about the original flag plant, \u201cSome of it was last year.\u201d He talked about how Ohio State sang their fight song on Oklahoma\u2019s field.\n\nMayfield has been brash and bold since before he was in the NFL, and he hasn\u2019t stopped. Plenty of people are crowing now that Mayfield is struggling in his second season, but the league would be more interesting if more players showed their personality. That\u2019s part of the reason the NBA is so good.\n\nMayfield isn\u2019t above holding a grudge for a year. Bosa held one for a couple years. It\u2019s too bad the Browns and 49ers don\u2019t play every year, because this was just getting good.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa (97) waves a 49ers flag after beating the Browns on Monday night.
