How do we make this happen, what are the risks and how do we make sure we aren't over-stretching ourselves?\n\nThe children are back at school but for some that means a big year ahead as they decide on secondary schools - and try to get in\n\nThis is Money's Will Kirkman replies: It\u2019s that time of year again when the kids have gone back to school and for many parents with children in their final year a time to start making plans about the next school move.\n\nStories abound of parents going to great lengths to get their children into a good school, from moving house to converting to a new religion.\n\nCompetition is so hot that in some areas nearly half of children are rejected from their preferred secondary school, according to the Good Schools Guide.\n\nOn top of the stress that finding the right school brings, if you're considering moving to a new home in a different catchment area, this brings its own unique set of complications.\n\nUltimately, whether or not to do so will be a decision only you can make, as everybody's circumstances will be different.\n\nWe would strongly recommend looking into your preferred school's admissions criteria and the rules your local education authority applies, as there may be specific things you need to know about applying close to the time of a move.\n\nFor those that are looking to move, we asked Legal and General Mortgage Club's Kevin Roberts for his top tips on how to get the finances right.\n\nKevin Roberts, director of legal and General Mortgage Club, replies: Catchment areas have long been a dilemma for parents who want to secure their children a place at the best local school.\n\nWith private school fees rocketing in many areas, more and more parents are looking to secure a place for their child in the best state schools.\n\nThere are currently just 703 \u2018outstanding\u2019 rated state secondary schools, academies and colleges across England, so planning is essential.\n\nUnfortunately, recent findings have shown that the additional cost of buying a home near one of the best state schools has now climbed to \u00a3180,000.\n\nThis is a steep premium, but for many parents, it\u2019s a price worth paying. And for those that are planning, now is not a bad time to buy.\n\nMore and more parents are looking to secure a place for their child in the best state schools and applications will need to be this winter for next year\n\nStretching to a bigger mortgage without too much risk\n\nMortgage lenders are increasingly introducing cheaper and cheaper long-term 10 or 15 year fixed-rate deals.\n\nThough not quite as cheap as shorter term deals, these can give parents certainty over their monthly payments until after their child has completed both primary and secondary school.\n\nLegal and General's Kevin Roberts\n\nThis means you won't have to worry about your monthly mortgage repayments going up in that time.\n\nYou should also consider how long you want your term length to be.\n\nPreviously, 25 years was a standard term length, but now, terms of up to 30 or even 40 years are available.\n\nLonger term mortgages have traditionally been an aid to first-time buyers, but with careers lasting longer than in previous generations, mortgage lenders are not opposed to offering a 40-year mortgage to someone in their thirties.\n\nFor example, according to finance experts Moneyfacts on a \u00a3250,000 repayment mortgage monthly repayments at a rate of 3.5 per cent over 25 years are \u00a31,252.\n\nHomes within an outstanding school\u2019s postcode carry an average asking price of \u00a3427,000 - 73 per cent higher than the national average of \u00a3247,000.\n\nTaking into account this premium, borrowing a larger sum of \u00a3363,000 over a 40-year term could see monthly payments of around \u00a31,074.59 at a fixed two-year rate of 1.87 per cent.\n\nFixing vs tracking\n\nThe two main types of residential mortgage deals are fixed-rate and variable-rate, and both can offer something slightly different to someone in your situation.\n\nVariable-rate products can offer greater flexibility, and help you avoid high early repayment charges if you decide to move again \u2013 potentially an outstanding primary school might not sit in the same catchment area as the most reputable senior school in your area, so it\u2019s worth considering this approach.\n\nFixed-rate products give borrowers more certainty over monthly repayments and rates are lower than lenders\u2019 standard variable rates which could be a valuable saving as uniforms, school trips and other school expenses do tend to add up to a larger sum than might have been hoped.\n\nYou can read This is Money's complete guide to variable and fixed-rate deals here.\n\nBe prepared to face higher house prices if you're moving into a desirable catchment area\n\nWill you get a mortgage?\n\nMortgage affordability rules are now more complex than they used to be. While lenders still primarily use income to determine affordability, there are now other checks in place. Alongside reviewing earnings, lenders will also look at outgoings and other debts.\n\nAs moving into a desirable catchment area is likely to involve an increase in total mortgage, it\u2019s sensible to review your current household finances ahead of applying. Paying off any existing debts and reducing other regular outgoings will also help to make sure .\n\n>> For more top tips on how to get the right mortgage deal, read our guide", "description": "We are thinking of moving to make sure we live within the catchment area of a great secondary school, but realise lots of other parents are probably having the same idea and that makes it expensive.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
