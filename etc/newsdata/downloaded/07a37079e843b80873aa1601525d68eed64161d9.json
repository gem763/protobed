Island authorities hope to turn it into an internationally recognised nature reserve - but that nature is under threat from droves of some insatiable assailants.\n\nGoats outnumber human inhabitants 12-to-1 and are munching stretches of Samothraki into a moonscape.\n\nSemi-wild, they roam across the island roughly three times the size of Manhattan. Their unchecked overgrazing is causing crisis-level erosion.\n\nThe Sustainable Samothrace Association has been working for more than a decade to educate locals on the issue and propose solutions to the goats, and lately also sheep, overgrazing.\n\nFor its vice-president, forestry expert George Maskalidis, the situation has reached a tipping point as overgrazing has intensified erosion across the island causing massive landslides when it rains.\n\n\"There are no big trees to hold the soil. And it's a big problem, both financial and real because (the mud) will come down on our heads,\" he said.", "description": "50,000 goats, 3,000 humans - Samothraki's chefs like those odds", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/70/70/1000x563_cmsv2_5ca83806-fb7a-53b6-b201-bc4ae58be957-4217070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
