Sure, the automaker had been underperforming, but the chief executive appealed for time to show he was fixing things. He assured them the redesigned Explorer SUV rolling out months later would be a proof point.\n\nBut rather than help the earnings results Ford delivers this week, the Explorer will be a hindrance. Sales have plunged as a plant plagued by personnel problems has struggled to get the new sport utility vehicle out the door. Thousands have been shipped 270 miles away to another Ford factory for rework.\n\nThe botched Explorer launch puts Hackett back in the position he was early this year -- testing the patience of investors. A downbeat assessment of how long it will take to turn the automaker around already cost the company an investment-grade credit rating. By pointing to the SUV as one of the first products he influenced, the CEO staked his reputation on it.\n\n\u201cFrom a design, styling and content standpoint, it hit the marks,\u201d Jeff Schuster, a forecasting analyst for LMC Automotive, said of the Explorer. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t get out of the gate, that certainly is going to put some question marks not only on his credibility, but from a consumer standpoint, on the vehicle itself.\u201d\n\nThe transformation of Ford\u2019s Chicago assembly plant was one of the most complex in the company\u2019s history, a spokeswoman said. The company is shipping the new Explorer -- the all-time best-selling SUV nameplate in the U.S. -- to dealers now and performing additional quality inspections as needed, she said.\n\n\u2018Big Negative\u2019\n\nFord probably will report on Wednesday that third-quarter profit slipped to 26 cents a share, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg, down from 29 cents a year ago. Automotive revenue is expected to dip to $34.3 billion, from $34.7 billion.\n\n\u201cThis Explorer issue is going to be a big negative for the quarter,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst for Morningstar who rates Ford the equivalent of a buy. \u201cIt\u2019s a viciously competitive market and you don\u2019t want to be missing one of your big hitters.\u201d\n\nFord shares have fallen 15% since Hackett, 64, took over in May 2017. The stock slumped 37% during the tenure of his predecessor, Mark Fields.\n\nWhen Ford reported early this month that Explorer deliveries collapsed by almost half during the quarter, Mark LaNeve, the automaker\u2019s U.S. sales chief, said dealers had adequate inventory to sell.\n\n\u201cAvailability has improved dramatically over the last 30 to 45 days,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to hit our stride with Explorer starting now.\u201d\n\nSupply in showrooms may indeed be building up, but a batch of about 2,500 Explorers in need of repairs arrived recently at the company\u2019s factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, which for weeks has been fixing and finishing vehicles shipped from the Chicago plant where the SUV is built, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBuggy Screens\n\nLaNeve told analysts on Oct. 2 that the Chicago plant had started shipping Explorers directly to dealers. But most of those models also have required repairs before they can be sold, said the people, who asked not to be identified describing internal issues the company is having.\n\nAnd not all problems with Chicago-built SUVs are being fixed before they reach customers\u2019 driveways. Consumer Reports had problems with the Lincoln Aviator -- a mechanically similar model built alongside the Explorer -- that the magazine\u2019s testers purchased last month for $63,400. The digital gauges that display speed, fuel consumption and other important information shake and flip, making them difficult to read.\n\n\u201cFord does tend to struggle with the new introductions, especially if they\u2019re a larger departure from the previous design,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing. \u201cIt could take a few years to get the bugs worked out.\u201d\n\nFord is not experiencing similar setbacks as it begins building a redesigned version of its Escape compact SUV at its factory in Louisville, Kentucky. LaNeve told analysts the Escape \u201cis a much more normal launch.\u201d\n\nProblematic Plant\n\nDays after the January debut of the new Explorer -- which hadn\u2019t been redesigned in almost a decade -- Hackett described Ford\u2019s product product development as \u201cconstipated,\u201d and said his executive team was fixing what ailed the company.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co.\u2019s Jim Hackett and Wall Street analysts started this year frustrated with one another.
