What I mean by that is it gives you an opportunity to do things that you could not do before.\u201d\n\nThe tactic has been linked to Saul Alinsky, the radical Chicago community organizer of whom former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are disciples.\n\nCALIFORNIA SALON OWNER BLASTS GOV. NEWSOM OVER HOMELESS CRISIS: HE'S MORE CONCERNED WITH 'TROLLING' TRUMP\n\nIn November 2018, California voters defeated a statewide ballot initiative that would have extended rent control statewide. It was soundly rejected by an almost 20-point margin. Every county in the state except for San Francisco voted it down.\n\nEven the Democrat running for governor, Gavin Newsom, indicated his opposition to the initiative. But now that he's in office, the former lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco has changed his position, insisting the state must respond to the homeless problem.\n\nLast week we learned of at least one of the actions the governor plans to take. Newsom signed a statewide rent-control law, overturning the will of the people. He followed the progressive playbook by using the homeless crisis \u201cto do things that you could not do before.\u201d\n\nProgressives assert that the homeless crisis is due in large part to a housing shortage, and that the best way to address the shortage is with rent control. The new law also protects tenants from eviction without good reason and provides compensation to tenants if they are evicted due to renovation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe housing crisis is reaching every corner of America, where you\u2019re seeing high home prices, high rents, evictions and homelessness that we\u2019re all struggling to grapple with,\u201d said Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill. \u201cProtecting tenants is a critical and obvious component of any strategy to address this.\u201d\n\nIt may be \u201cobvious\u201d to some, but any scratching of the surface of California's rent law shows it to be utterly useless.\n\nFirst, the law ignores the fact that the state's epicenters of homelessness, Los Angeles and San Francisco, already have rent control on the books that's even more stringent than what just passed.\n\nIn San Francisco, studies show the caps have sharply decreased the supply of rental housing, driving up rents citywide by 5 percent. That's because landlords demolished properties and built pricey new ones to avoid the caps.\n\nIf rent control helps reduce homelessness, why is the problem so prevalent in the very cities that already have it? And how is extending it to the rest of the state supposed to address the issue?\n\nRent control has been a proven failure in addressing housing problems. It prompts landlords to convert their properties into owner-occupied homes, and deters investment in the housing market, aggravating the shortages that caused them in the first place.\n\nThe truth the left would prefer you not to know: The homeless problem has little to do with lack of affordable housing. There is plenty of affordable housing in California outside major cities. For instance, next to Los Angeles County is Riverside, where the average rent is $1,525 per month, close to the national average of about $1,400.\n\nNot everyone can afford to live exactly where they want to live. Most Californians understand this.\n\nWhat politicians must acknowledge is that the real cause of most homelessness is the prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse in the homeless community. According to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development report, 45 percent of homeless people suffer from mental illness. A University of Pennsylvania report, found that about half suffer from alcohol or drug dependence.\n\nIn addition, a U.S. Conference of Mayors report in 2014 revealed that only 18 percent of the homeless are employed. That means that for most, the cost of housing doesn't really matter. They simply can't afford it.\n\nRent control has been a proven failure in addressing housing problems. It prompts landlords to convert their properties into owner-occupied homes, and deters investment in the housing market, aggravating the shortages that caused them in the first place.\n\nFurther, when landlords are limited in their ability to raise rents and cannot freely evict tenants, they will be extremely careful in who they rent to. That has a significant adverse effect on the ability of low-income people to find rental housing. Europe has had such limitations for years, and it's notoriously difficult to qualify for a rental property there.\n\nEurope similarly requires \u201cgood cause\u201d before terminating an employee; the thinking being that this will result in fewer layoffs and thus lower unemployment. In fact, it has the opposite effect. The harder it is to fire someone, the more cautious employers are in hiring.\n\nThe same concept applies to housing.\n\nAddressing homelessness with a statewide rent-control law highlights why California\u2019s homeless problem has gotten so bad.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nState politicians would rather use the crisis to pass pet progressive policies rather than address root causes with real solutions. One can only imagine what progressive \u201csolution\u201d is coming next.\n\nPerhaps a $1,000-a-month \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d for the homeless?\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JIM BRESLO", "description": "California Gov.
