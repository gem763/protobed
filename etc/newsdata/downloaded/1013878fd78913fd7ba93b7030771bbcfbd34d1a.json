He held a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday night. (Oct 11) AP, AP\n\nIRVING, Texas \u2013 In the political heart of Texas, a state Republicans have dominated for decades, Democrats say they are gaining ground \u2013 and one of the reasons for that transformationis flying into Dallas-Fort Worth on Thursday.\n\nHis name is Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Trump's policies on immigration, trade and the economy remain popular in Republican-leaning Texas, Democrats say the president's actions are helping them build a base of their own among Hispanics, city dwellers, and college-education professionals in the Lone Star State.\n\n\"The political atmosphere for Democrats in Texas is better than it has been for decades,\" said Matt Angle, founder of a Democratic strategic communications firm called the Lone Star Project.\n\nTrump is still favored to carry Texas in the 2020 election \u2013 he won it by nine percentage points in 2016 \u2013 but members of both parties said Democrats are in a position to make it more of a challenge.\n\nPresident Donald Trump during a campaign rally this year in El Paso, Texas.

From Texarkana to El Paso, the state is a giant ATM for presidential candidates in both parties, and Trump begins his day Thursday with fundraisers in Fort Worth.\n\nTrump then heads to nearby Johnson County, where he will help cut the ribbon at a new Louis Vuitton leather manufacturing workshop, an appearance designed to highlight his emphasis on jobs as a campaign issue.\n\nThe big event is a Thursday evening rally at the downtown sports arena in Dallas.\n\nAs in rallies last week in Minnesota and Louisiana, Trump will look to buck up his base as he faces numerous challenges back in Washington, D.C. \u2013 most notably an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\nTrump and aides predicted that a backlash against impeachment will help Trump. \"Texans appreciate people who are straight shooters,\" Murtaugh said, \"and they don\u2019t like it when people change the rules after they lose.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump answers questions from reporters during an event on \"transparency in Federal guidance and enforcement\" in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019, in Washington.

Much of that growth is in Hispanic communities and the big city areas of Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio; Democrats said many of these new Texas residents are voting with them.\n\n\"All of our new voters are going Democratic by a radio of 5-to-1,\" said Ed Espinoza, executive director of a political organization called Progress Texas.\n\nMore: Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront\n\nTrump is a trigger for many of these voters, according to state Democrats. His efforts to crack down on immigration are alienating Hispanic voters; his aggressive style, including attacks on allies and lawmakers of color, turn off many suburbanites, particularly women.\n\n\"Trump is a huge liability for the Republican Party,\" said Brittany Switzer, a spokesperson for the Texas Democratic Party. One result, she said, is \"we see a huge coalition and we're looking to build that coalition.\"\n\nRepublicans said the demographic argument is overstated. There are many conservative Hispanic people, they said, and GOP candidates in Texas can get a fair share of their votes; same with the growing suburbs.\n\nSpeaking for the Trump campaign, Murtaugh described the idea of \"Blue Texas\" as \"one of the great myths we hear about every election cycle, but it never comes true.\" He said he hopes Democrats spend money in Texas \"because that\u2019s cash they won\u2019t be able to spend defending other states like Minnesota.\"\n\nStill, there is Republican concern that manifested itself in a high-profile Senate race just last year.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto Rourke (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP)\n\nBallad of Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz\n\nO'Rourke, a former House member, did not defeat the first-term incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 but he came as close to winning as any Texas-wide Democratic candidate has in a quarter-century.\n\nWhile Cruz won 50.9% to 48.3%, some analysts said the race foreshadowed the emerging and more politically competitive Texas. O'Rourke raised around $80 million and activated hundreds of thousands of new voters, particularly in the growing urban areas.\n\nO'Rourke certainly sees it as a sign of the future. In seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, he claims he could carry Texas and its 38 electoral votes, foreclosing Trump's hopes to victory nationwide.\n\nAfter Trump announced his rally in Dallas, O'Rourke scheduled a counter-rally Thursday evening in nearby Grand Prairie. In his invitation to supporters, O'Rourke said \"we will not be defined by this president\u2019s fear, his hate, or the differences between us that he tries to exploit.\"\n\nCruz also sees a changing Texas. In September, he told a group of reporters that suburban voters, particularly women, are \"moving left,\" and \"that\u2019s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013 states like Texas, states like Georgia, states like Arizona \u2013 much more purple.\u201d\n\nReferring to fellow Republicans, Cruz said: \"If we lose Texas, it\u2019s game over.\u201d\n\nWhither Republican Texas?\n\nTexas Republicans say they don't see a Democratic state anytime soon. Some called 2018 an anomaly, in part because Cruz was relatively unpopular among other Republicans. GOP members noted that the incumbent governor, Greg Abbott, won his reelection easily.\n\nO'Rourke's fundraising would be hard for a presidential candidate to duplicate, they said. It's questionable as to whether the Democrats would be willing to spend that kind of money on a presidential race in Texas, and might to want to spread it to more competitive states.\n\nSaid Mackowiak: \"2018 was a very weird year in Texas.\"\n\nTrump made a late-campaign stop in Houston to stump for Cruz, and later took credit for his victory. Some analysts wonder if the hot-button president didn't cost Cruz some votes, but it's impossible to say for sure.\n\nAs for 2020, Texas Republicans noted that Trump did win by 9 percentage points in 2016, and a reversal of that size is hard to imagine.\n\nSteve Munisteri, a former GOP state chairman in Texas, said it all boils down to numbers.\n\nGenerally, in recent elections, statewide Republican candidates get around 4.5 million votes, he said; Democrat candidates have a base of around 4 million.\n\nGiven the state's growth, Munisteri's new target is 5.5 million voters. And, as usual, it will boil down to whichever party can turn out that many votes.\n\n\"If the Republicans don't get out their vote, and the Democrats do turn out their vote, the Democrats can win a statewide race,\" he said.\n\nIt doesn't look like the Alamo for either party; Munisteri said getting out all those new voters in future elections is more like another battle.\n\n\"It's going to be like the western front in World War I,\" Munisteri said. \"Trench warfare.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/17/election-2020-donald-trump-texas-democrats-make-waves/3970045002/", "description": "While Trump's policies remain popular in Republican-leaning Texas, Democrats say the president's actions are helping them build a base of their own.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Published A.M.
