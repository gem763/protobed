House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), GOP Conference Chairman Liz Cheney (Wyo.) were among the 129 Republicans who crossed party lines and voted for the Democratic-drafted measure, a dramatic slap at Trump in the midst of one the most serious foreign policy crises of his presidency. Sixty Republicans, mostly hardline conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus, voted against the measure.\n\nTrump is scheduled to hold a meeting with House and Senate leaders from both parties Wednesday afternoon in the Cabinet Room. Administration officials who were set Thursday to brief rank-and-file lawmakers in both chambers on the situation have postponed the session.\n\nYet even top Republicans \u2014 normally wary of crossing the thin-skinned president \u2014 expressed deep dismay over Trump's latest comments, which they viewed as a sign the president is digging in over his controversial move to abruptly upend U.S. foreign policy in the region.\n\n\"I hope President Trump is right in his belief that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is of no concern to us, abandoning the Kurds won\u2019t come back to haunt us, ISIS won\u2019t reemerge, and Iran will not fill the vacuum created by this decision,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \"However, I firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\"\n\nTrump later pushed back at Graham - a vocal Trump critic turned huge loyalist - saying the South Carolina Republican \"would like to stay in the Middle East for the 1000 years... I think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary.\"\n\nLawmakers in both parties also slammed the president's remarks as undermining Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, who are traveling to Ankara on Wednesday to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The high-level U.S. delegation hopes to broker a ceasefire between Turkey and Kurdish forces, although Erodgan already told Sky News that he had no plans to halt the offensive.\n\n\u201cBig, big mistake,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) of Trump\u2019s Syria policy. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m pretty certain of is that Erdogan is not going to agree to a ceasefire until he\u2019s established control of northern Syria.\u201d\n\nTrump may still avoid a formal rebuke in the GOP-controlled Senate, where some Republicans are beginning to soften their criticism.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has given no indication that he would allow a version of the House resolution to be taken up by his chamber, although that may change after the White House session.\n\nMcConnell said Trump's decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria was a \"mistake.\" But he also noted that there was only so much Congress could do to convince Trump to change his mind.\n\n\"Any president has a lot of latitude in deploying troops and many of us have been arguing that this was a mistake, it shouldn't have been done and hoping that he would reverse course,\" McConnell said. \"There seems to be no evidence of it so far.\"\n\nMcConnell didn't directly address the House resolution condemning Trump's removal of troops from northern Syria, but reiterated that the Senate is considering legislation that would impose sanctions on Turkey.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged McConnell at a press conference to bring the House resolution to the floor.\n\n\"This legislation is a repudiation of President Trump's actions- a clear repudiation,\" Schumer said. \"There is no better way to put pressure on him.\"\n\nOne Republican senator privately said the resolution seemed less popular in the caucus at this time because it could. Other Republicans said the meeting with the president on Wednesday could determine the legislative response from Trump\u2019s own party.\n\n\u201cI would hope that he would be open to changing his policies based on the inputs he gets... we have some very strong views up here on what\u2019s going on. And we\u2019re in a tough spot now because the horse is out of the barn,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota. \u201cWhatever discussions occur with the White House and president, hopefully we\u2019ll find a way to move forward in the same direction.\u201d\n\nDemocrats expressed little hope that Trump will reverse course and planned to move ahead with the resolution vote in the House before the White House huddle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any kind of idea why the president has had this meeting. Perhaps to inform us of why he made this decision. So we\u2019ll see,\u201d Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said (D-Md.). \u201cIt is hard to conceive of an action more helpful to our enemies\u2026 This is a betrayal of our allies across the world and the consequences are growing by the day.\u201d\n\nThe administration dispatched Defense Secretary Mark Esper to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to explain Trump\u2019s Syria decision to a group of House Republicans. But GOP lawmakers were not satisfied by Esper\u2019s response to questions about how the Pentagon was going to prevent the resurgence of ISIS, according to aides familiar with the meeting.\n\nSome Republicans are hoping leadership is able to nail down more information during Wednesday\u2019s White House meeting,\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to know what the latest is with the ISIS terrorists who are being held in Syria by the Kurds. Do we know their whereabouts? Have some been sent back to their country to be tried?\u201d Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI want to first hear what their plan is right now. There are still a lot of concerns that we don\u2019t want ISIS to be able to regroup and to be able to come back after we finally had them at bay.\u201d\n\nGOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), an outspoken critic of Trump's Syria shift who plans to attend the White House meeting, will unveil a sanctions package on Wednesday that has broad GOP support and is tougher than the bipartisan legislation being drafted by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nCheney did not call out Trump by name during a GOP press conference on Wednesday morning, though she did take a shot at rival Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has loudly backed Trump's decision.\n\n\u201cOur allies the Kurds frankly are facing what looks like a betrayal from the United States. That could have very negative impacts and consequences for us globally,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cIf we go down the path that's been suggested by Sen. Paul and others into isolationism, then others will fill that void.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle and Burgess Everett contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/75/1bf0ee4846dd8b9e14b4b201354d/191016-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
