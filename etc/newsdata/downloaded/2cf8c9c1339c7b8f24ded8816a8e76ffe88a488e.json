As a result, Lundstram is the top-scoring 'defender' in the Fantasy League.\n\nPRICES CUT FOR ENGLAND'S GRAND NIGHT\n\nThe FA have cut ticket prices for England's European Championship qualifier against Montenegro next month despite plans for celebrations around the fixture, which will be the national side's 1,000th game.\n\nAdult tickets for the November 14 fixture at Wembley now start at \u00a330 for a game which could see Gareth Southgate's side seal qualification for the Euros.\n\nEngland can seal qualification for next summer's Euros against Montenegro at Wembley\n\nAGENCIES CUT BACK\n\nThe cut-throat nature of the football agency business has led to a number of casualties this season, with Kin Partners and Pitch International Representation scaling back their football operations. Staff have left both firms after difficulties in attracting and retaining clients in a competitive market.\n\nThe Association of Football Agents have warned that many more of their members will encounter problems if FIFA's proposals to cap commissions are introduced, and they are threatening legal action against the governing body.\n\nFA AND PREMIER LEAGUE IN BREXIT ROW\n\nThe FA and the Premier League are so divided over how they should adapt their immigration rules in response to Brexit that they cannot agree on how the impact of having home-grown players in the top flight should be measured.\n\nThe FA champion clubs such as Burnley and Bournemouth, whose squads are full of players born in Britain. But the Premier League view is that producing squad players for bottom-10 clubs has little relevance, as they are unlikely to win England caps or enhance the league's quality.\n\nThe FA want to increase the number of home-grown players in each match-day squad from eight to 13 after Brexit, a quota which the Premier League are strongly resisting.\n\nEFL PLANNING EDINBURGH TRIBUTE\n\nThe Justin Edinburgh 3 Foundation, which was established after the sudden death of the Leyton Orient manager in June from cardiac arrest, are in talks with the EFL about dedicating a round of matches to the former Tottenham defender this season.\n\nThe weekend of December 13-14 has been earmarked, as the fixtures take place a few days before what would have been Edinburgh's 50th birthday, although the authorities have yet to give the go-ahead. In addition to fundraising, the foundation are also campaigning for a change in the law to make it mandatory for all gyms and health clubs in the country to be equipped with defibrillators.", "description": "AHEAD OF THE GAME - MATT HUGHES: Former Aston Villa chief executive Keith Wyness (left) has prepared an explosive statement to open his case against the club for unfair dismissal.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20193326-0-image-a-55_1572028700427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
