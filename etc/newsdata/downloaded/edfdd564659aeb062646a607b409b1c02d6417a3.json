Authorities have cut off mobile communications in the valley and detained nearly 4,000 people, many of whom have since been released, according to the government.\n\nAt least 300 people have been arrested under the Public Safety Act (PSA), which allows for detentions of up to two years without trial, the government said. Most have been sent to jails across the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMany are young men like Malik, a high-school dropout who works in construction. But there are others like Ronga, a former head of the bar association in Kashmir, and dozens of other lawyers, academics and leaders of political parties.\n\nIndian officials say the policy of transporting detainees, which started last year but has snowballed since August, is required to cut off militants from their networks.\n\nThe transportations are often conducted without warning, and families say they are allowed little contact with detainees once they find them. Proving innocence is difficult even for those with resources given the communications situation in Kashmir and the number of cases.\n\nSanjay Dhar, the registrar general of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, said two judges in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar were handling around 300 appeals against PSA detentions filed since Aug. 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCUSED OF AIDING MILITANTS\n\nMalik, 19, grew up in Shopian, a town of around 16,000. As a child, he was friends with two boys who joined a militant group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, a rebellion that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.\n\nThat childhood association forms the basis of the case against him, according to court documents.\n\nIn the documents, Malik is accused of assisting the two militants \"in letter and spirit\" and giving them \"logistic support\". They also say he participated in protests and an operation against security forces, between February 2018 and July 2019.\n\n\"You not only yourself indulge in stone pelting but instigate others,\" one document said.\n\nMalik's family denies the charges and say he has not seen the boys who joined the militants since they left. They said he participated in protests in 2016 and was hit in the eye by a metal pellet fired by security forces, partially blinding him. Malik dropped out of school and his family had to sell land to pay for surgery.\n\n\"He hasn't done anything since,\" his mother, Haseena Malik, said. \"He has made no mistake.\"\n\nDilbag Singh, chief of police for Jammu and Kashmir, said people detained under the PSA had been involved in subversive and terrorist activities, or disturbing public order.\n\n\"All required procedural requirements under law are followed while executing detentions under PSA,\" he said.\n\nSingh said some individuals had been moved due to lack of space in Kashmir's jails. He said authorities were \"checking the specific details\" regarding the detentions of Malik and Ronga but had no additional information on their cases.\n\nFARAWAY JAIL\n\nFor almost two weeks after he was arrested, Malik's family visited him twice a day, and officers repeatedly told them he would be released soon. But he was abruptly moved to the central jail in Srinagar, 50 kilometers away.\n\nWhen his family went to check on him, they were told he had been moved to a jail in Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, with 84 other Kashmiris. The jail is one of at least six facilities in Uttar Pradesh where Kashmiris have been moved, officials said.", "description": "One is a 19-year-old construction worker charged with aiding militants against Indian troops, the other is one of Kashmir's most prominent lawyers, accused of being \"an incorrigible secessionist\".
