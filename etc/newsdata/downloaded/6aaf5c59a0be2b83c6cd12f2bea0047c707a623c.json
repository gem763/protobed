Use your phone for something other than scrolling through Facebook.\n\nChange your mindset on how you use your phone.

Most people know where it is at all times, and are constantly grabbing it, reading mom blogs with it, playing on it, or just scrolling and wasting time.\n\nAnd while I won't ask you how much time per day you spend on Internet searching and scrolling, I will ask you to change your mindset about your phone. Instead of looking at your phone as an escape, look at your phone as a tool to help you overcome and stay on track. Phones are helpful in so many ways that we often tend to forget their true function. Your phone can help you balance everything. It's crazy simple.\n\nFor example, if you know that you need to do at least three loads of laundry every single day, but somehow it never happens, your phone is there to help.

Just like that, you got a friendly reminder from your phone and you're on track (now folding ... that can be a whole other alarm on its own!). Keep setting those alarms throughout the day and soon enough, you'll start to notice that your mind will create a routine that you don't even have to think about. Plus, knowing you got your tasks done during the day means more peace at night when you have time for some TLC.
