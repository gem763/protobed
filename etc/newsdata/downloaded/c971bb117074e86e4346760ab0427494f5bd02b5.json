The town has seen an influx of undocumented children, but Brink does not support a plan to expand local schools. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\nIt was the first day of school, so Don Brink was behind the wheel of his bus, its yellow paint glistening in the drizzling dawn. Wearing jeans and a John Deere cap, he turned the radio to an oldies station and, with hands callused thick by 50 years of farming, steered the vehicle toward the edge of town.\n\nHe stopped in front of familiar farmhouses surrounded by fields of soy and corn, where blond children boarded the bus, chatting in English.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d the 71-year-old Vietnam veteran said.\n\nThis was the Worthington he knew.\n\nBut then Brink headed back into town, past the meatpacking plant that was the area\u2019s main employer and into the neighborhood he called Little Mexico, even though most of its residents were Central American.\n\nThis was the Worthington he did not know \u2014 the Worthington he resented.\n\nAt the corner of Dover Street and Douglas Avenue, a handful of Hispanic children were waiting. At Milton Avenue, there were a few more. And at Omaha Avenue, a dozen students climbed aboard \u2014 none of them white.\n\nBrink said nothing.\n\n\u201cI say \u2018good morning\u2019 to the kids who\u2019ll respond to me,\u201d he said later. \u201cBut this year there are a lot of strange kids I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nThose children, some of whom crossed the U.S.-Mexico border alone, have fueled a bitter debate about immigration in Worthington, a community of 13,000 that has received more unaccompanied minors per capita than almost anywhere in the country, according to data from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).\n\nFive times in just over five years, the district has asked residents to approve an expansion of its schools to handle the surge in enrollment. Five times, the voters have refused \u2014 the last time by a margin of just 17 votes. A sixth referendum is scheduled for November.\n\nThe divide can be felt all over Worthington, where \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d has devolved into \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d window signs, boycotts on businesses and next-door neighbors who no longer speak. A Catholic priest who praised immigrants was booed from the pews and has received death threats.\n\nThe driving force behind the defeats has been a handful of white farmers in this Trump-supporting county, including Brink, the bus driver.\n\nEven as he earns a paycheck ferrying undocumented children to and from school, Brink opposes the immigration system that allowed them to come to Worthington.\n\n\u201cThose kids had no business leaving home in the first place,\u201d Brink said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have all these food pantries, because of all these people we are supporting. I have to feed my own kids.\u201d\n\nNow he pulled up to the same high school where he and his wife had walked arm-in-arm as teenage sweethearts, and watched his passengers step down into a stream of dark-haired children, among them a pregnant 15-year-old from Honduras and a 16-year-old girl from Guatemala who\u2019d arrived months earlier.\n\nFor the two unaccompanied minors, their first day of school was an opportunity.\n\nFor Brink, it felt like an affront.\n\n'They arrive every day'\n\n\n\nWorthington, Minn., has received more unaccompanied minors per capita than almost anywhere else in the country, crowding its schools. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\nInside Worthington High, more than a thousand students were scrambling to find their classrooms before the morning bell, their sneakers squeaking on the freshly polished linoleum.\n\nA dozen Hispanic boys crowded silently into the office, looking confused. One wore soccer cleats with jeans. They were among the 129 kids who\u2019d arrived in the district over the summer.\n\n\u201cYou guys know where you\u2019re going?\u201d an administrator asked. \u201cYou need help?\u201d\n\nSince the fall of 2013, more than 270,000 unaccompanied minors have been released to relatives around the country as they wait for immigration hearings. Many have ended up in large cities: 16,000 in Los Angeles; 18,000 in Houston; 20,000 in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThousands more, however, have ended up in small towns like Worthington, where their impact is dramatic.\n\nIn those six years, more than 400 unaccompanied minors have been placed in Nobles County \u2014 the second most per capita in the country, according to ORR data.\n\nTheir arrival has helped swell Worthington\u2019s student population by almost one-third, forcing administrators to convert storage space into classrooms and teachers to sprint between periods, book carts in tow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of our buildings are over capacity,\u201d said Superintendent John Landgaard.\n\n\u201cThe school district is busting at the seams,\u201d added Mayor Mike Kuhle.\n\nSchool districts don\u2019t track immigration status but they do keep tabs on English language learners (ELL), who are generally more difficult and costly to educate.\n\nThe number of ELL students in Worthington has nearly doubled since 2013, to 35 percent of students. In the high school, where most unaccompanied minors are placed, it has almost tripled.\n\n\u201cThey arrive every day, all year long,\u201d said Julie Edenborough, director of migrant services for Guymon Public Schools in Texas County, Okla., the only place to receive more unaccompanied minors per capita than Nobles County. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about kids who couldn\u2019t write their own name, who couldn\u2019t hold a pencil.\u201d\n\nSchool districts like Guymon and Worthington have scrambled to hire Spanish-speaking teachers, who are part educators, part parents, part therapists. Many unaccompanied minors live with unfamiliar relatives who offer little support. Teachers often fill the void, arriving early, staying late, even buying their students groceries.\n\n\u201cA lot of these kids suffer horrible trauma on the journey to the United States,\u201d said Perla Banegas, who until recently taught newcomers at Worthington High. \u201cSome were sexually abused. Others were almost murdered by a gang or left in the desert.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Worthington resident shows support for school expansion. In five years, voters have rejected an expansion five times. A sixth referendum is set for November. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\nMany students feel pressured to work to pay off their debts and contribute to household expenses: rent, electricity, even WiFi.\n\nOne 17-year-old asylum seeker from Guatemala said he cleaned a meatpacking plant by night, attended class by day and milked cows in the afternoon before grabbing a few hours of sleep.\n\nBut he could never fully repay the Worthington relative with whom he was living. Now 18, he\u2019s dropped out of school, moved to another state and works construction. His asylum hearing is scheduled for March in Minneapolis but he fears he won\u2019t have the money to attend, forfeiting his already uphill battle for asylum.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think the United States was going to be like this,\u201d he said recently. \u201cSo hard.\u201d\n\nThis school year didn\u2019t start easily for the 16-year-old from Guatemala or the 15-year-old from Honduras. The older girl misread her schedule and arrived 45 minutes late, then had to leave to get vaccinated. The younger one arrived on time only to be scolded.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t wear shirts like that,\u201d the attendance secretary told her in English, pointing to the Honduran\u2019s floral blouse, which hung off her shoulders and exposed her bra straps. As a family friend who\u2019d driven her to school translated, the girl tugged up her shirt.\n\nThe two headed toward the girl\u2019s classroom, and the morning bell rang.\n\n\u201cGood morning and welcome back, WHS students and staff,\u201d a woman announced over the loudspeakers. \u201cPlease stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.\u201d\n\nBut the girl kept walking.\n\n\u201cYou have to stop and show your respect,\u201d the friend whispered in Spanish. \u201cThey do this every day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, okay,\u201d the girl said as she stared at the students with their hands on their hearts.\n\n\n\nStudents learn vocabulary in a class for English learners at Worthington High. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\n'It is racism'\n\nWhen Don Brink attended high school in the 1960s, Worthington was almost entirely white. But by the end of the century, the population was 20 percent Hispanic: primarily Mexicans drawn to the area\u2019s poultry farms and meatpacking plant.\n\nIn 2007, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 230 undocumented workers at the plant. Immigrants kept coming, however, mostly from Central America. Today the town is almost two-thirds minority. Hispanics outnumber whites.\n\nWhile nearby towns have shrunk and their schools have closed, Worthington has grown. Signs in Spanish and Lao now line downtown, where Mexican restaurants compete with a new microbrewery. A Guatemalan flag flies in the window of a store selling soccer jerseys and baby blankets. On a recent afternoon, \u201cHello\u201d was written on the sidewalk in chalk in 11 languages.\n\nEven as Worthington has changed, however, its tax base still depends largely on white farmers like Brink, pitting the town\u2019s future against its past.\n\nIn 2013, when the school district first asked voters to pay for new classrooms amid the influx of unaccompanied minors, those farmers feared they would bear the brunt of the $39 million. The bond referendum failed.\n\nThree years later, when the school district asked for $79 million, some locals felt insulted.\n\n\u201cThey shot for the moon,\u201d said Dave Bosma, who transports livestock for a living. He voted for the referendum the first time around only to join Brink and others in opposing it in 2016. They called themselves Worthington Citizens for Progress, raising money door-to-door and distributing \u201cVote No\u201d fliers at the town\u2019s annual turkey race.\n\nThe group also hired a controversial consultant named Paul Dorr, who for decades has worked to defeat public school referendums across the Midwest. Dorr\u2019s aggressive tactics, which once included burning LGBT children\u2019s library books in another town, only deepened the divide.\n\nThe second referendum was defeated by a 2-1 margin on Nov. 8, 2016 \u2014 the same day Donald Trump won 62 percent of the vote in Nobles County.\n\n\n\nPi\u00f1atas hang in the window of Miguel Rivas\u2019s cellphone shop in Worthington. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nAn Asian food store and Mexican grocery anchor the downtown square. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\nAttitudes have only hardened since then, as three more referendums have failed. Citizens for Progress unsuccessfully tried to oust the superintendent, and a former teacher who shared students\u2019 private information with the group was charged with a crime. Accusations of racism have become commonplace.\n\n\u201cWhite people here don\u2019t want to pay for people of color and undocumented children to go to school,\u201d said community activist Aida Simon.\n\nThe rising tensions reflect broader shifts in the state. Last fall, some Republican candidates called for Minnesota to stop accepting refugees, many of whom are Somali Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere was concern among citizens as to the cost of refu\u00adgee resettlement,\u201d said Jeff Johnson, the GOP\u2019s gubernatorial candidate who supported a suspension. \u201cOften the answer was \u2018you\u2019re racist.\u2019 It shut down the discussion.\u201d\n\nIn Worthington \u2014 where the congressional district flipped Republican in 2018 \u2014 the discussion has centered less on Somali refugees than on Central American asylum seekers, who Trump warned were \u201cinvading\u201d the United States ahead of the midterm.\n\nOn the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Father Jim Callahan took to the pulpit at St. Mary\u2019s Church to defend the migrants. As he delivered his sermon, boos echoed off the stained glass windows. A parishioner\u2019s son, in town for the holiday, was heckling him.\n\nAnother man approached Callahan after a different sermon on immigration and threatened to kill him, the priest recalled. And a stranger at a gas station spit in his face.\n\n\u201cThey can call it whatever they want,\u201d Callahan, 69, said of the opposition to expanding the school system, \u201cbut the bottom line is that it is racism.\u201d\n\nMembers of Citizens for Progress says their concerns are purely financial at a time when farmers are already hurting from flood-damaged crops and the trade war with China.\n\n\u201cOn a weekly basis I\u2019m told I hate children,\u201d said Bosma, 37, whose kids go to a private Christian school. \u201cI\u2019m just a young guy trying to make a living for myself and put food on the table for my family. I look at the bank account at end of the month and say, can I afford another $200 in property taxes this year?\u201d\n\nBrink also insists he isn\u2019t prejudiced. His own grandparents were immigrants from Holland, and his parents spoke some Dutch. But he doesn\u2019t believe Worthington should be a destination for the undocumented.\n\n\u201cI wish they would have another ICE raid,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to get rid of the illegals.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven as he earns a paycheck for driving undocumented children to school, Brink, 71, opposes the immigration system that allowed them to come to Worthington: \u201cThose kids had no business leaving home in the first place.\u201d (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nBrink, a Vietnam veteran, has lived and farmed in the area his whole life. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\n'Half the town is illegal'\n\nThe 15-year-old sat near the classroom window, her belly nearly touching the desk in front of her.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t known she was pregnant when she left Honduras in February, after the father who\u2019d left her behind as a baby called to tell her to join him and his new family in America. Then she\u2019d started throwing up in her hotel room in southern Mexico.\n\nShe\u2019d thought about turning back, back to the boyfriend who had begged her to stay.\n\nInstead, she continued north, crossing the Rio Grande in a raft before spending two days in a Texas Border Patrol facility and a month in a Florida shelter.\n\nNow she was 3,000 miles from home, back in school and about to give birth.\n\n\u201cI want to learn a little bit more about you guys,\u201d her teacher said, first in English, then Spanish.\n\nWhen it was her turn, the girl gave her name and said she\u2019d arrived four months ago. She didn\u2019t mention that her child was a boy or that she wanted to name him after the dad he might never meet.\n\nShe had worried she\u2019d be surrounded by kids who didn\u2019t speak her language. Instead, she found herself in a class with 14 Guatemalans and two Salvadorans.\n\nSitting across the room, the 16-year-old from Guatemala was one of the last to speak.\n\nShe was the shy youngest child of maize farmers in the western highlands who were too poor to send her to school. It had been three years since she sat in a classroom. Asked about the best part of her first day, she would later say simply: \u201cLearning.\u201d\n\nShe lived in what had once been a nice house near the school where the intricate crown molding was now crumbling and the wallpaper was coming off in sheets. But instead of sharing her bed with siblings, she now had her own room. The older sister who\u2019d brought her here had decorated it with paper orchids to remind her of home.\n\nThe teacher asked the class to create name tags emblazoned with words representing them.\n\nThe pregnant girl wrote \u201cMath,\u201d her favorite subject.\n\nAt 1:15 p.m., she left early for a medical appointment. The doctor told her the baby was healthy but the girl cried anyway, thinking of her boyfriend.\n\nAt 2:50 p.m., the 16-year-old walked out of school with a new friend. The two girls had grown up a few miles from one another in Guatemala but only met in America, where they now live a block apart.\n\nAs they strolled home, they passed Guatemalan ladies in lawn chairs waiting for their children and an elderly white couple sitting on their porch. They oppose the referendum to expand the schools.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford the taxes,\u201d the woman said later, even though she works part-time at the middle school and knows the classrooms are overcrowded.\n\n\u201cHalf the town is illegal,\u201d added her 80-year-old husband, an oxygen tube in his nose.\n\nAcross town, Don Brink was picking up kids at the middle school, which is 20 percent white.\n\nHe earns $83 a day from the bus route. But as he drove through the town that immigrants had revived, listening to oldies, he thought only of what has been lost. And he worried that this time, the referendum would pass.\n\n\n\nMany immigrants work at the JBS pork processing plant in Worthington. (Courtney Perry/For The Washington Post)\n\nJohn D.
