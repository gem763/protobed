The retailers group has already laid out its views on competition issues to the House Judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, which is investigating the technology industry, Ahrens said.\n\nThe group wrote a letter to the FTC dated Sunday, arguing that the tech platforms create an \u201cinformation bottleneck\u201d that has the power to skew markets and circumvent the traditional power of price competition.\n\nThe group also raised concerns about how tech companies may compromise the brands of retailers, favor their own products over those of sellers on their platforms, accumulate data about competitors and allow for the proliferation of counterfeit goods.\n\nIt should be \u201cquite concerning to the commission that Amazon and Google control the majority of all internet product search, and can very easily affect whether and how price and product information actually reaches consumers,\u201d the trade group said in a letter responding to a series of hearings the agency held on competition policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon and Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe FTC has claimed oversight of probes of Facebook Inc. and Amazon, while the Justice Department is set to scrutinize Google and Apple Inc. Separately, the House Judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee kicked off a broad antitrust investigation into the technology industry last month with a hearing on how Google and Facebook have affected the news industry.\n\nThe retailers group said it agrees with sentiments echoed by Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, as well as more than 40 attorneys general, that prices shouldn\u2019t be the sole measure of harm.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cthe combination of information control and market power that should worry antitrust regulators the most,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThat unhealthy combination exists at the level of the internet\u2019s pipelines, at the level of product search, in webhosting, on social media platforms and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe group also pointed to Amazon\u2019s perceived dominance of e-commerce, where it has nearly half of U.S. online sales. Because it is both a retailer and a marketplace for third-party sellers, Amazon has drawn scrutiny over whether it uses its clout and huge amount of sales data to give itself a leg up over smaller vendors \u2014 an issue that the European Union is already investigating and that prompted calls by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a 2020 presidential hopeful, to break up the online retailer and other tech platforms.\n\nAmazon says it holds only a small percentage of the nation\u2019s total retail market and faces formidable competition from the likes of Walmart.", "description": "A leading U.S. retail group \u2014 whose members include Walmart, Target and Best Buy \u2014 volunteers to help antitrust enforcers as they investigate the tech giants.", "authors": ["Bloomberg Delivers Business", "Financial Information", "News", "Insight Around The World."], "top_image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17c372e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2047x1075+0+39/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fca-times.brightspotcdn.com%2Fd8%2F1c%2F80b6fd6ab115337ccf3dfd48c2f2%2Fla-1562016670-mklmao2z5a-snap-image", "published_at": "2019-07-01"}
