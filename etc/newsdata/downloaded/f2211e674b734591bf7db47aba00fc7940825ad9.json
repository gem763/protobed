Photograph by Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nWhen Stifel\u2019s head of equity strategy, Barry Bannister, spoke with Barron\u2019s in June, he argued the Fed would at the very least need to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. That has since happened, but he still says the central bank isn\u2019t being bold enough.\n\nBannister notes that while the Fed\u2019s quarter-point interest-rate cut on Wednesday was largely expected, he\u2019s still concerned that the \u201cFed is willing to play defense instead of offense, and anything they do could end up being too late.\u201d\n\nHe believes the Fed has already skirted too close to the line in terms of allowing the funds rate to get too close to his calculation of what the neutral rate (one that is neither too tight or loose) is.
