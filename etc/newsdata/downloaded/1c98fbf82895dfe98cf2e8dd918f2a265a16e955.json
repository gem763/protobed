He hit .295 in 15 years in the majors with Milwaukee, Houston, San Diego, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nVenable has been the Cubs\u2019 first base coach for the past two seasons. He also worked in Chicago\u2019s front office before moving to the coaching staff.\n\nThe 36-year-old Venable played in the majors for nine years, batting .249 with 81 homers.\n\nThe team confirmed Tuesday that Loretta and Venable are being considered for the job. President of baseball operations Theo Epstein said Monday that Ross, a former major league catcher who works in Chicago\u2019s front office, is a possibility.\n\nThere has been no word on the external candidates for the position. Epstein said Monday that at least one person who works for a playoff team is on their broad list.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cubs coaches Mark Loretta and Will Venable are being considered for the team's managerial opening.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/cubs_baseball_67501_c0-202-3425-2198_s1770x1032.jpg?60ea097806f13b839611f64f3b427856f573350f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
