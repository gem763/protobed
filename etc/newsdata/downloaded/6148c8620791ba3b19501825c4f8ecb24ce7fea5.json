She eats them now but her favourite things are cucumbers and carrots!'\n\nWhile the news was disheartening for the little girl, her father said it was 'important children know' where food comes from and if Erin is 'old enough to ask the question', she is 'old enough to get the answer'\n\n'I love it when she asks questions, being a parent you get a lot of questions but I don't think children should be shut down when asking questions. Erin always asks more questions and I think it's great!'\n\nSome people have even said Mr Copeland should show Erin the conditions which animals live in but he feels 'she's a bit too young for that'.", "description": "Erin Copeland, 3, slammed her fork down and said she was 'done' with sausages after her father Brian Copeland told her 'we turn the pigs into sausages' at their Glasgow home, shared on October 16.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/19876058-0-image-a-30_1571388604240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
