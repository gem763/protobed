This is a competitive advantage that Northern Ireland is going to have.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important for business but also for fishing and farming. So if you think about all those who are engaged in fishing off the west coast, those that are engaged in farming, they\u2019re not going to get the same terms and opportunities that are going to be offered to those in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cI welcome the fact that Northern Ireland has got this deal but Scotland has been ignored through this.\n\n\u201cIn a country that has voted so heavily to remain, I\u2019d simply say to the people of Scotland that we need to have a general election and people have to respond to the position that we\u2019ve got that if people vote for the SNP, then that\u2019s a vote for the people of Scotland to have their right to determine their future in an independence referendum.\n\n\u201cWe want to stay in Europe, we want to be an independent country, we want to be a destination in Europe and, if you like, that bridge between Europe and a United Kingdom that might be outside of it.\n\n\u201cBut we sit back and allow the UK to take us out of the European Union against our will.\u201d\n\nThere have also been calls for a motion of no confidence to be triggered against the UK Government.\n\nHowever, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed having another EU vote before an election is held.\n\nMr Blackford said: \u201cWe are happy to trigger a motion of no confidence, we\u2019ve said to the other opposition parties, \u2018accept your responsibilities\u2019.\n\n\u201cI look forward to having an election and pitting ourselves against the Tory MPs in Scotland that look as if they\u2019re going to vote for this.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to vote against the interests of the people of Scotland, and the other opposition parties should accept their responsibilities as well.\u201d", "description": "The SNP\u00b4s Westminster leader said the arrangements will put Northern Ireland at an advantage over Scotland.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/wire-19879772-1571394539-955_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
