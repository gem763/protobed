Gothy Kendoll stood by her Leicester tiger look in an interview with MailOnline on Friday, after the judge slammed it\n\nRu didn't make it easy for the queens, as he tasked them to also make a look that paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, and Gothy admitted she wished she had 'prepared more' for the challenge.\n\n'I actually was meant to have a skirt made but the designer let me down last minute, so I had to make that skirt out of a net curtain in my hotel,' she revealed.\n\nDespite hitting out at Alan, Gothy admitted that she realised the critiques were being given in 'a British, humorous way' so she wouldn't take them to heart as it helped her realise 'where I need to grow and where I need to develop.'\n\nGothy continued: 'You just can't take things to heart, everyone has got an opinion and it's about caring about your own opinion rather than someone else's.'\n\nHarsh words: The Chatty Man host compared her to an estate agent who had gotten a 50p face paint makeover\n\nHitting back: But Gothy refuted his comments, as she said: 'I don't care what Alan says about it being an estate agent, because I was wearing Mugler and he wasn't!'\n\nGood luck: Ru didn't make it easy for the queens, as he tasked them to also make a look that paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II\n\nDiscussing what she'd do differently, Gothy -who became the first eliminated queen- confessed that she was 'gutted' she wasn't able to show off her drag persona 'at her best' but still felt 'pretty amazing' for getting on the show.\n\nShe added that she'd take at least three weeks to prepare if given the chance to do things over, as she 'didn't have the contacts that some of the queens who have been doing it for ten yeas have.'\n\n'I found budget and preparing really difficult,' Gothy revealed. 'So I would have definitely taken those three weeks more seriously and made sure I had realised everything to the best I could have.'\n\nDIY: Of her regal look, Gothy revealed: 'I actually was meant to have a skirt made but the designer let me down last minute, so I had to make that skirt out of a net curtain in my hotel'\n\nSeeing the funny side: Of her final farewell, Gothy joked: 'I think in that moment you're thinking \"I'm leaving first\" so you've got to make a joke out of it'\n\nAfter losing out to Vinegar Strokes in the lip sync battle, Gothy sashayed away by paying homage to Drag Race star Vanessa Vanjie Mateo's iconic 'Miss Vanjie' exit line, by saying 'Miss Kendoll' as she left the stage.\n\nOf her final farewell, Gothy joked: 'I think in that moment you're thinking \"I'm leaving first\" so you've got to make a joke out of it, that is the British way of getting through things. Just taking the piss out of myself, it really helped me get through it.'\n\nWhile she was the first queen eliminated, Gothy has found the overwhelming support from Drag Race fans 'really nice' as it's been 'amazing so far, the fans are really what makes it.'\n\nBut it's been the support form her fellow competitors that's been the most important to Gothy, as she revealed the queens have a group chat and are 'always texting all day' to one another.\n\nSashay away: Gothy is the first eliminated queen after she lost the lipsync to Vinegar Strokes\n\nShe said: 'Divina [De Campo] was the first drag queen i met, so she's responsible for everything. Me and her are close, and me and Blu [Hydrangea] are really close as well, we just hit it off.'\n\n'It's great as well because they come from different walks of drag, so it's nice to have friendships with them because we all learn and grow from each other.'\n\nThe Vivienne came out on top in the first episode, winning the first RuPeter badge of the season for her hometown and Queen Elizabeth II looks, and Gothy claimed she's 'what thy're looking for this season.'\n\n'She really sold those looks on the runway, she might not necessarily have been the best, but she sold them, which is what they are looking for this season. She might be wearing flats, but she won!'\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK continues on Thursdays at 8pm on BBC Three.", "description": "The drag queen, 21, admitted to MailOnline that she was happy with her first runway, despite the Chatty Man host, 43, comparing her to an estate\u00a0agent who got 50p face paint.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler", "Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/01/19320310-0-image-a-21_1570234842429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
