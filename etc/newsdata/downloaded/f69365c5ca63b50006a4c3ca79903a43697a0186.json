REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo\n\nTear, who will replace Henrik Clausen, told Reuters he would continue with an existing turnaround plan, which aims to boost margins by cutting the company\u2019s distribution network and leaving it with fewer selling points.\n\n\u201cIn Logitech we managed to get a positive growth mindset throughout the organization, and I hope to do the same with B&O, focusing more on the financial results when executing our strategy,\u201d said Tear, who was vice president at keyboard and mice maker Logitech until April.\n\nShares in B&O are down more than 70% over the past year as it has struggled with weak demand for its TVs and repeatedly cut sales and profit forecasts.\n\nThe stock rose as much as 9.5% at the market open and was 3.3% higher at 1138 GMT.\n\nABG Sundal Collier analyst Andr\u00e9 Thormann said investors were reacting positively to the change in leadership, but doubted whether it would be enough on its own.\n\n\u201cPeople are important, but it is hard to tell whether a new CEO will be enough to turn things around as the company has already been trying to face its product challenges and transform the business,\u201d Thormann said.\n\nB&O\u2019s biggest shareholder is Chinese investor Qi Jianhong, who owns just under 15% in the company through his Sparkle Roll companies, according to Refinitiv data. In April 2016, B&O rejected a takeover bid from Sparkle Roll.\n\nB&O Chairman Ole Andersen said in August, after the company\u2019s third profit warning, that \u201cthe warning bells\u201d were starting to ring and that the board would listen if approached by a buyer.\n\nThe company, whose televisions can sell for up to 96,000 Danish crowns ($14,123), was founded in 1925 and built its initial success on innovative audio technology.", "description": "Shares in Bang & Olufsen (B&O) jumped on Tuesday after the struggling Danish TV and speaker maker said its chief executive was leaving with immediate effect, to be replaced by former Logitech executive Kristian Tear.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438336141&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970C3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
