The quarterback left Heinz Field and underwent further evaluation at a local hospital, according to the team.\n\nAfter the play concluded, Steelers players immediately motioned for assistance from the training staff as Rudolph lay motionless on the field. He completed a 26-yard pass to wide receiver James Washington with 7:29 left in the third but took a helmet-to-helmet hit from Thomas directly on his chin.\n\nThomas was flagged for roughing the passer as the Heinz Field crowd responded with a chant that begged officials to eject the All-Pro defensive back. Due to an issue with the injury cart, Rudolph eventually stood up and slowly walked off the field with the help of teammates.\n\nBefore the injury, Rudolph completed 13-of-20 passes for 131 yards and a touchdown. Backup quarterback Devlin Hodges, who was elevated to the 53-man roster following Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending elbow injury, replaced Rudolph.\n\nHodges completed 7-of-9 throws for 68 yards in the Steelers\u2019 26-23 overtime loss to the Ravens.", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 Pittsburgh Steelers starting quarterback Mason Rudolph exited Sunday\u2019s game against the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
