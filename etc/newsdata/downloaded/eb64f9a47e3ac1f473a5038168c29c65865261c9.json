The grounding has led airlines to demand compensation, and in some cases refunds as uncertainty over when the plane can fly again continues.\n\ncaption The coffins of Paul Karanja\u2019s wife and three children who died in the March Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft, photographed in October 2019. source SULEIMAN MBATIAH/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThird quarter results also coincide with news that crash investigators in Indonesia told relatives of the first fatal crash, by a Lion Air plane in October 2018, that design issues with the 737 Max plane contributed to the fatal plunge, alongside \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the flight crew\u2019s communication.\n\nSome analysts are now starting to turn against Boeing, with both UBS and Credit Suisse no longer recommending that investors buy Boeing shares.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Robert Springarm said on Monday that \u201cwe can no longer defend the shares in light of the latest discoveries, discoveries which significantly increase the risk profile for investors\u201d after Reuters reported internal messages from a former Boeing pilot who said the Max software was acting erratically for months before the plane started flying.\n\nRead more: Boeing 737 timeline: From the early days to the grounding of the 737 Max after 2 fatal crashes that killed 346 people 5 months apart\n\nIn its second-quarter results, Boeing said that it lost nearly $3 million, on top of a $5 billion already factored in over the continued grounding of the plane around the world.\n\nBoeing could announce another charge as delays in getting the plane back in the air continue, CNN reported, citing Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst with investment bank Cowen.\n\nHe said on Monday that the charges \u201care apt to be large.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s previous results also suggested that the Washington state-based aviation giant could soon lose its crown as the world\u2019s largest planemaker, as its deliveries fell behind its European rival Airbus.
