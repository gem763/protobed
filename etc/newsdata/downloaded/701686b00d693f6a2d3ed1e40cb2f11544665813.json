Elizabeth Warren accused Facebook on Monday of emboldening Donald Trump, even suggesting that the social media company\u2019s leadership struck some deal with Trump behind closed doors that explains why he is allowed to promote misleading ads on its platform.\n\nThe ascendant Democratic candidate laid out her argument in a series of tweets on Monday without supplying any concrete evidence for her claim that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had bent to Trump\u2019s wishes after the pair met in Washington two weeks ago. Warren\u2019s implication came as Zuckerberg and Warren are increasingly sniping at one another, both in public and in leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting earlier this summer, during which Zuckerberg referred to a potential Warren presidency as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to his company.\n\nIn her tweets, Warren said that Facebook \u201cintends to use their influence in this election,\u201d which is a rebuttal of the company\u2019s argument that it\u2019s merely a platform for debate.\n\n\u201cTrump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u201d Warren said in one tweet. \u201cAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on \u2018misinformation\u2019 in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies,\u201d the next tweet read.\n\nWarren did not offer any hard facts to link the meeting to the policy change. But she noted that Facebook is allowing the Trump campaign to air advertisements about corruption in the family of Joe Biden, ads that some TV networks have said they would not air because they are false.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn her tweets, Warren also criticized Facebook for its failures to live up to its promises to combat disinformation in the wake of the 2016 election. Facebook recently clarified that it will let politicians break the platform\u2019s normal content rules if the content they post is newsworthy, a policy that angered some on the left who want to see Facebook more aggressively police problematic content.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIn fact, this time they\u2019re going further by taking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat. This is a serious concern for our democratic process.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s comments reveal that she sees some political upside to continuing to quarrel with Zuckerberg, and they illustrate the political scrutiny the company must tolerate now that Zuckerberg\u2019s comments about her have been made public.\n\nBut what the hostility belies is that Silicon Valley is actually increasingly comfortable with Elizabeth Warren, as we wrote about last week \u2014 even if Warren continues to punch its most recognizable leader.", "description": "Warren\u2019s comments reveal that she sees some political upside to continuing to quarrel with Zuckerberg.", "authors": ["Theodore Schleifer", "Allegra Frank", "Jane Coaston", "P.R.
