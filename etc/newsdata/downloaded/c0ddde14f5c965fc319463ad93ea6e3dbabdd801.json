Califf to lead the company's health and strategy policy.\n\nBoth Califf and DeSalvo will start later this year.\n\nGoogle and parent company Alphabet are investing broadly in the health industry, from researching new drugs and devices to bolstering its cloud-computing business to serve more companies in the life sciences. Late last year, Google hired David Feinberg, who had served as CEO of Geisinger, to oversee its expansion in the $3 billion health care sector.\n\nReporting to Feinberg, DeSalvo will advise Google on providers, doctors and nurses across the company's cloud unit and Alphabet's life sciences arm Verily, where she's been on the advisory board. DeSalvo, who sits on a number of medical boards, previously served as assistant health secretary and national coordinator for health information technology in President Obama's Health and Human Services department.\n\nFeinberg has been consolidating teams across the company, including its hardware division and artificial intelligence division DeepMind, which announced its biggest breakthrough in health last month.\n\nWATCH: The rise of deepfakes and what Facebook, Twitter and Google are doing", "description": "Karen DeSalvo is the latest notable hire in Google's effort to go big in health and life sciences.", "authors": ["Jennifer Elias"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106112057-1567627632025anemployeepassesthegooglelogo.jpg?v=1568291818", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
