Why was she in the bottom two? That's my question.\n\n\"When we have to judge it we do what we feel and it came down to my choice this week. I stand by it 100%.\n\n\"I absolutely adored [Catherine] in past weeks. She did really well. She was just unfortunate this week.\"\n\n(Image: Roland Leon Sunday Mirror)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nIt may come as no surprise that Craig threw his support behind Shirley as he had initially voted to save Katya Jones and Mike Bushell.\n\nThe judge bragged he was happy with the result despite the public outcry among Strictly fans.\n\nHe added: \"Yeah I was [happy with the result]. The public weren't. I just say vote, you must vote. The public have 50% of the vote, not just four of us.\n\n\"We look professionally who is a better person, whether it be technical, entertainment value, anything like that.\n\n\"The audience at home have a chance to change the leaderboard entirely. Ann Widdcombe got to week 11 and she wasn't the best dancer. That's got to be considered.\"\n\nIt comes after the four Strictly judges come under fire for sending Dev Griffin home in recent weeks.", "description": "Shirley and Craig hit back at the public outcry over Catherine's controversial exit from Strictly Come Dancing", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Lily Waddell", "Image", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748965.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Pride-Of-Britain-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
