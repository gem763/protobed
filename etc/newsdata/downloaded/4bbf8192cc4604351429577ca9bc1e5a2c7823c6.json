The Coalition announced in March this year it would progress a mandatory dairy code of conduct to give farmers more trading power. \u201cThere has been some push-back from the old guard that don\u2019t want farmers to have the freedom they deserve, and that\u2019s what this code is going to do; break the exclusive nature of contracts that restrain their trade,\u201d Mr Gillespie said. The Nationals MP told Sky News the plight of dairy farmers was further suffering due to the current drought. \u201cCosts for dairy farmers in particular have skyrocketed because of the drought, and they\u2019re leaving in droves,\u201d he said.
