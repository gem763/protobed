He is seen outside court on October 14\n\nMiss McConville's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth in 2003\n\nTimeline of Jean McConville's murder by IRA terrorists November 1972: Jean McConville is abducted from a bingo hall and beaten by an IRA terrorist who accused her of being an informer. December 1972: The mother of 10 is dragged out of her house in front of her family by a 12-strong IRA unit before being shot and buried in an unknown location. August 1994: An IRA ceasefire leads to a campaign to identify the final resting place of the IRA's 'disappeared' victims - whose resting places had never been found. 1999: The IRA finally admit to murdering Ms McConville. August 2003: Ms McConville's body is found by chance on a beach in County Louth. 2010: Former IRA man Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes claims Gerry Adams ordered Ms McConville's murder. Adams has always denied both being an IRA member and involvement in the murder. 2011: The Police Service of Northern Ireland launches a successful legal battle to obtain tapes given to the Boston Project, an oral history programme that had heard testimony from IRA terrorists. March 2014: Ivor Bell is arrested and charged with aiding and abetting the murder. October 2019: He is acquitted after the tapes were ruled inadmissible.\n\nMr Bell, of Belfast, was not present for the trial of the facts which came after he was found medically unfit to stand trial in December last year. He was excused from attending due to his health.\n\nJudge Mr Justice O'Hara directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty having earlier ruled that taped interviews, which were the central plank of the prosecution case, were inadmissible.\n\n'As a result of some legal rulings which have been made over the last two days there is now no evidence that the prosecution can put before you to support the case it was putting against Mr Bell,' he said.\n\n'My role now is to direct you to return a verdict of not guilty because you simply cannot find him to have done the acts alleged.'\n\nThe judge also lifted restrictions that had prevented reporting of the two-week trial of the facts.\n\nThe prosecution case centred on an interview given by interviewee Z to Anthony McIntyre for the Boston College-sponsored Belfast Project, an oral history project of Northern Ireland's troubled past.\n\nTapes from the project were seized by the PSNI in 2014 following a transatlantic court battle. The prosecution argued that Z is Mr Bell.\n\nThe trial was the subject of blanket reporting restrictions which were lifted on Thursday following a challenge from a number of media organisations.\n\nFollowing the Crown Court ruling, the McConville family said they are 'bitterly disappointed'.\n\nIn a statement they said: 'We are bitterly disappointed that [the tape of the interview with Z] cannot be used in evidence in this case.\n\n'But whatever happens (with) the legal technicalities, everyone in the court this week heard how the abduction, murder and disappearance of our mother 47 years ago was planned and who was behind it. They always knew it and now so does the rest of the world.\n\n'For 20 years the IRA denied they had anything to do with murder and disappearance and they only admitted it when it suited them.\n\n'She was not an informer and Gerry Adams has confirmed in court that he didn't believe that she was.'\n\nMr Bell leaving Belfast Magistrates' Court after a judge ruled he would stand trial over Ms McConville's murder\n\nJim McConville gives a thumbs up as he leaves Belfast Magistrates' Court in July 2016, after a judge ruled that Ivor Bell will stand trial over his mother's murder\n\nThe McConville family have demanded a full public inquiry into their mother's death.\n\n'She was a loving, working class widowed mother doing her best to raise 10 children,' their statement added.\n\n'They murdered her because they could. We may not have got justice but we have got some truth. But this cannot finish here.\n\n'We need and demand a full public inquiry. We've heard Gerry Adams often call for inquiries. Will he support this one?'\n\nIvor Bell's solicitor Peter Corrigan said: 'The Boston Tapes were of no benefit from a historical perspective, never mind meeting the threshold of evidence in a criminal trial.\n\n'The process from start to finish was fatally flawed, which lacked the relevant safeguards, and is described by one expert during the course of this trial as 'exactly not how to conduct an oral history project'.'", "description": "Ivor Bell was today cleared of soliciting the notorious murder, which saw the Belfast mother dragged from her home and shot.
