The new tab has 200 \"trusted\" publishers participating, with some receiving between $US1 million ($1.45 million) and $US3 million for sharing their news content.\n\n\"I think every internet platform has a responsibility to try to help fund and form partnerships to support news,\" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in the fireside chat with Mr Thomson last week.\n\nIn December 2017, Google and Fairfax Media struck an agreement for the US tech behemoth to sell and market programmatic advertising across the websites of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, WAToday and the Brisbane Times, and across the publisher's lifestyle brands. In December 2018, Fairfax merged with Nine. The deal was the first of its kind for Google.\n\n\"It's not appropriate for me to assess or comment on what Facebook is doing or not doing in the evolution of their history,\" Mr Gingras said. \"As [Zuckerberg] mentions internet platforms, I think it's immensely important to recognise that this is not a generic term.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are different kinds of instances of what a platform is. Facebook is a private platform ... our platform with Google, with Google Search, with Google News, with our ad technologies is the open web.\"\n\nMr Gingras said Google has offered huge value to news publishers for multiple years, pointing to the search referrals, $US14.5 billion paid to publishers via the use of its ad technologies and the Google News Initiative, where it earmarked $US300 million for products and partnerships across journalism.\n\nMr Gingras previously said Google does not accept payment to be included in search results but it does sell clearly marked ads, which was one reason they don't pay publishers when people clink on news website links in search results.\n\n\"We're very comfortable with the amount of commitment that we've made towards making sure that there is a healthy ecosystem for news,\" he said.\n\n\"We will continue to do that and continue to enhance those efforts, until we all get to that place where there is a sustainable ecosystem for news and I have no doubt for that being the case, it's just a question of getting there.\"", "description": "Google and Facebook have come under significant scrutiny globally for their impact on journalism and the business models underpinning it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2893%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_811%2C$y_63/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d6c92477b6380d6b3d09e84655c4d17cff8fd2f5", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
