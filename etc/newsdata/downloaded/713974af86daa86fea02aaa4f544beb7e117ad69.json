Let\u2019s be grateful for that, I suppose. Still, what happened this month in Rome portends a real revolution in the Catholic Church. Vatican journalist Marco Tosatti, on his blog (in Italian), writes:\n\nSo he did it again. But this time with even greater arrogance than the previous ones. In a nutshell: he organized a local synod \u2013 which should have been carried out locally, to examine locally any local problems of a situation involving a few million faithful on the one billion and three hundred million of the planet \u2013 to pass changes, like the tip of the wedge, that will be quickly seized by interested bishops here and there, everywhere, and that would not have been approved if they had been submitted to the examination of a \u201ctrue\u201d world synod.\n\nTosatti says \u2014 you can translate it via Google Translate \u2014 that the synod was paid for by the German bishops, who want to see these changes. And now, says Tosatti, Catholics will by year\u2019s end see Francis confirming everything that the Synod passed. Tosatti ends with this:\n\nWe close with what a priest, once Anglican and now Catholic, writes in commenting on the Synod: \u201cFor the first time since my conversion to the Catholic faith I don\u2019t think if I was an Anglican now I would have bothered converting. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019d never go back to Anglicanism\u2026but I don\u2019t think that if I was an Anglican now I\u2019d see the point of being a Catholic. At the moment the Catholic Church is simply offering what Anglicans were promoting 20 years ago \u2026 just before they collapsed \u2026 it\u2019s embarrassing\u201d. Oh yes, it\u2019s embarrassing, Your Holiness. And also tragic.\n\nI wondered if that Anglican-turned-Catholic priest might have been Father Dwight Longenecker. I looked on his blog for his take on Pachamama. It does not contain the lines Tosatti quoted, but Fr. Longenecker does say this about what he calls \u201cthe Pachamama problem\u201d:\n\nThe statues were actually idols representing the earth mother goddess Pachamama. She is worshipped with pagan rituals all across South America. They way they worship her is pagan. They present offerings to her, light candles, and make prayers to her asking for protection, prosperity, peace and good luck. The ritual in the Vatican garden and in St Maria Transpontina showed all the evidence of pagan ceremonies. This is in direct contradiction to the Catholic faith and it should have been corrected and excluded from a Catholic church. If the ceremonies were not pagan in their intent and practice, then clarification and explanation should have been provided so the faithful who do not understand Amazonian culture would not be scandalized.\n\nThis is what Pope Francis\u2019s English biographer had to say:\n\n\u201cPraying to Mother Earth\u201d? Like that makes it okay? That\u2019s still idolatry.\n\nIf Francis formally adopts what the Amazon Synod has approved \u2014 on women deacons, on ordaining married men as priests, and, most crucially, on adopting a new Amazonian liturgical rite that incorporates local spirituality (which can only mean syncretism of the St. Pachamama sort) \u2014 then this pope will have given Evangelicals and Pentecostals in Latin America a spectacular gift. Not with the women deacons and married priests, but with the syncretism.\n\nAfter vespers in my Orthodox parish on Saturday evening, our priest talked about St. Demetrios, one of the most beloved saints of the Eastern church, whose feast day it was. (He is also a Western saint, as all pre-schism saints are.) St. Demetrios was a high-ranking Roman military official who converted to Christianity, and who brought a number of pagans into the faith. He was imprisoned and eventually killed in the early fourth century on orders of the Emperor. Listening to our priest talk about the life and martyr\u2019s death of St. Demetrios, I wondered how Catholics could square it with what this syncretizing successor of St. Peter is doing today.\n\nI have never considered returning to Rome\u2019s fold, which I left in 2006, though I have acutely felt the pain of separation when I\u2019ve been at Norcia, and in the company of dear Catholic friends. As regular readers know, I revere Benedict XVI, and even consider him the second Benedict of the Benedict Option. I have always thought of myself working, in whatever small ways I can, for reconciliation between Rome and the Orthodox East. I have always thought it unlikely before the Parousia, but we can at least labor towards that goal of reconciling brothers, right?\n\nI will still work to build bridges, but after what Francis has done this month, I am certain that there is absolutely no way the Orthodox East will ever reunite with Rome. The Amazonian syncretism on display in Rome, blessed by this Pope, is utter anathema to the Orthodox. It breaks my heart to see this, because of the Catholics I know and love, and because as a man who lives in, and loves, the West, I have long believed that the fate of this civilization depends on the strength and stability of the Catholic Church. The crisis of the Catholic Church is not just a matter for Catholics.\n\nI do wonder, though, what effect this is going to have on Catholic evangelization in this country. If Rome is headed the way of Canterbury, as it appears, who would consider it safe harbor? In that regard, Francis has probably done a favor not only for Evangelicals, but for Orthodox churches too. Whatever other problems the Evangelicals have, and we Orthodox have, there will be no prayers in our temples to Mother Earth. What Francis permitted and blessed in Rome this month is something out of a Jack Chick fever dream \u2014 but it really happened.\n\nAnd let me make clear: though the Orthodox churches and some of the Evangelical (and conservative Reformed, and conservative Lutheran) churches may see our numbers rise because of disillusioned Catholics seeking another home, I don\u2019t know a single Protestant or Orthodox who takes any pleasure in watching that scandalous Pachamama spectacle in Rome this past month. It is one thing to disagree about a married priesthood, or women\u2019s deacons, or any of the other serious things that separate our communions. But this? This outright paganism, blessed by the Roman pontiff and brought into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and later installed in a side altar at a Rome parish \u2014 that feels as if the enemy breached a gate of a walled city, and is pouring through.\n\nTo let you know where this is all headed, take a look at the story of \u201cSister Jaguar\u201d \u2014 an elderly American Dominican nun named Judith Bisignano. She went to the Ecuadoran jungle, saw a black jaguar, took ayahuasca, and \u2026 well, let her tell it:\n\nWhile resting on sacred ground under the canopy of a star-filled universe, Pachamama (Mother Earth) invited me to take my place within her web of life that began with the first crack of the Big Bang. I knew I was called to blend my story of forgiveness into a new creation story. I knew I had to live and tell my truth.\n\nShe has written a prayer to Pachamama, that includes these groovy lines:\n\nPachamama, I celebrate the shift; the radical change that is emerging in human consciousness. This transformation transcends national, cultural and religious boundaries, and creates common ground for the emergence of a single Earth community. As I stretch my vision and imagination, I see that I am connected to a much larger family than I ever dreamed possible. This new community challenges my old ways of perceiving consciousness and gives me new visions that include all people, all creation, and the entire universe.\n\n\u201cSister Jaguar\u201d is a radical nun who tooted up on ayahuasca and went fully native. But you tell me: is the church Pope Francis is creating more compatible with Sister Jaguar\u2019s spirituality, or the faith of a small order of conservative French nuns? Rome smashed that tiny French order earlier this year, sending 34 nuns away because they were too traditional \u2026 but Pachamama prevails in the heart of the Vatican.\n\nEmbarrassing, yes \u2026 but also tragic. You don\u2019t need a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing in Rome.\n\nI\u2019ll end with this. The conservative Catholic blogger Father John Zuhlsdorf writes that he expects serious spiritual aftermath to come now. Drawing on the unsparing rebuke that the aptly named Bishop Athanasius Schneider hurled at the Vatican for this idolatry, Father Z compares the Pachamama debacle to the Golden Calf episode in Exodus 32, which had savage repercussions for the unfaithful, idol-worshiping Israelites. Excerpt:\n\nThe point: Glorious and horrible things result from idol worship and the overthrowing of false religion. I will repeat what I have written before. God chose us from before the creation of the cosmos to live in THESE days. It is an honor to be witnessing the crazy stuff going on. But it is incumbent on all of us now to buckle on the spiritual armor God offers and take places in the lines of the Militant Church of which we are members. Review your state in life. Make corrections if you have to. Use the sacraments well. Increase your mortifications and acts of reparation. Review your Faith and be ready to explain what you believe. Be inviting and be joyful and be confident. If something truly dreadful results in the Church from what we are seeing, know that Christ the King and Mary, Queen of Heaven, will triumph. Be on the winning side of that, even though it costs dearly. Let us close our ranks as never before in the face of the internal and external challenges to come.\n\nRead it all.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-27-at-10.57.48-PM-e1572235095180.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
