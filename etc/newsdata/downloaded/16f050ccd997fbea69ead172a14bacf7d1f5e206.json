Critics said that the show was everything that Victoria's Secret's annual runway show wasn't\u2014 inclusive and diverse, featuring models of all shapes, sizes, and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAmerica's former lingerie sweetheart is facing ongoing criticism for losing relevance in the wake of #MeToo and has seen sales slide in recent years as new, buzzier brands crop up and take market share.\n\nNow, Rihanna is taking it a step further by partnering with Amazon to stream her fashion show on its Prime Video service, in an attempt to beat Victoria's Secret at its own game.

Up until recently, Savage X Fenty had been sold exclusively on its own site or at pop-up locations, which are now closed.\n\nRihanna isn't the only high-profile celebrity to partner with Amazon in recent months. In July, Lady Gaga launched her new beauty collection, Haus Laboratories, exclusively on Amazon during Prime Day.\n\nNicole Quinn, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners and the venture capitalist who put together the deal, told Business Insider that Gaga had wanted to work with Amazon so she could make the brand inclusive for everyone. She wanted to be global from day one, she said.\n\nIn an interview with Business of Fashion, Rihanna said Amazon wasn't a partner she could consider turning down.\n\n\"Amazon came in and said, 'Hey, we want to be a part of it,'\" she said, adding: \"You're not going to deny a platform like Amazon Prime.\"", "description": "Rihanna's Savage X Fenty runway show from New York Fashion Week is now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84d7a92e22af58362c1276-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
