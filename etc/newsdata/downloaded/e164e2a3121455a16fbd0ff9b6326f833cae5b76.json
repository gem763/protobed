Paddy Dowling/Muslim Aid\n\nThe decision to permit Turkey to roll into northern Syria and effectively abandon the the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Ankara considers terrorists because of their support for a banned Kurdish separatist organisation inside Turkey, was widely criticised by Democrats and Republicans. It was also condemned in the region, by those who feared it could trigger more bloodshed.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, usually a staunch Trump ally, called the decision \u201cimpulsive\u201d, and suggested it would undo \u201call the gains we've made [and] throw the region into further chaos\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is in my view.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime and increase the risk of reorganisation by Isis.\u201d\n\nNikki Haley, Mr Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, also issued a condemnation of the decision, using social media.\n\n\u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against Isis in Syria.
