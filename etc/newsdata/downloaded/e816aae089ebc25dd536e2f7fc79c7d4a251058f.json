The audience decides what\u2019s funny\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Graham Norton has said there is no \u201cweird comedy police\u201d deciding what is and isn\u2019t funny, and that people don\u2019t want \u201cshock\u201d in entertainment today.\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian about his judging role on the UK version of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, Norton said that he didn\u2019t miss the dirty humour of his original Channel 4 chat show So Graham Norton as he has grown more sensitive.\n\n\u201cThings shock me now that wouldn\u2019t have shocked me when I was 25,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I have become more sensitive.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe continued, \u201cI always think it\u2019s weird when people talk about jokes and what you can do, or \u2018you can\u2019t say anything now\u2019. And it\u2019s like, the only people stopping you are your audience. They decide what\u2019s funny and what\u2019s not funny. There isn\u2019t some weird comedy police.\n\n\u201cIf I came out in front of my audience on a Thursday night and did some of those jokes we did [on So Graham Norton], the audience would just look ashen. And they wouldn\u2019t like it. It is partly, I think, because of Twitter and things now, where there\u2019s so much bile and viciousness out there that people don\u2019t want that in their entertainment.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
