USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 As it happens, the weather for Michael Bennett\u2019s first NFL practice in North Texas was colder than the weather in New England on Tuesday morning.\n\nSo the new Cowboys defensive end slipped his No. 79 jersey over a navy long-sleeve undershirt and gray sweatpants, star-specked helmet on his head as he joined stretching lines in the misty, 40-degree-windchill morning.\n\nThen Bennett geared up for his first practice alongside new fellow linemen.\n\n\u201cHis resume speaks for itself,\u201d defensive end Robert Quinn said afterward. \u201cSo I really don\u2019t got to brag on him too much.\u201d\n\nDefensive lineman Michael Bennett Tuesday at his first practice as Dallas Cowboy. (Photo: LM Otero, AP)\n\nThe Cowboys (4-3) acquired Bennett from New England in exchange for a conditional 2021 sixth- or seventh-round pick last Thursday heading into their bye weekend. The team lost defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford (hip surgery) for the season and expect Bennett to serve a similar versatile role playing tackle and edge as he defends against both run and pass.\n\nTwo-time Pro Bowler DeMarcus Lawrence has started this season at left end, while Quinn \u2014 whom Dallas acquired in March from Miami \u2014 has lined up right. Quinn has since notched six sacks in five games.\n\nQuinn said he expects the addition of Bennett to further fuel competition on a defensive line that coaches like to regularly rotate through games. Maliek Collins and Antwaun Woods have mostly started inside for the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want someone to come in and outshine you,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cNot in a disrespectful way. More just bringing the best out of a person, which makes it exciting.\n\n\u201cHis resume speaks for himself so I can\u2019t let him come in here and take all the shine.\u201d\n\nBennett has 65.5 sacks, 341 tackles, 182 quarterback hits and 13 forced fumbles in 147 career games. In 2018 with the Eagles, he posted nine sacks, 34 tackles and two forced fumbles.\n\nBut the Patriots\u2019 down-blitzing scheme didn\u2019t cater to Bennett strengths as well as a 4-3 scheme does, he and New England coaches thought. Add in a suspension his last game in New England for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team,\u201d and New England was ready to move on. Patriots coach Bill Belichick endorsed Bennett to the Cowboys. So did Cowboys defensive playcaller Kris Richard, for whom Bennett played five seasons in Seattle. Coaches and teammates said Bennett\u2019s familiarity with Richard\u2019s system and terminology are helping his adjustment.\n\n\u201cWe believe he fits into our scheme well,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cHe has been a productive player, playing in a four-down scheme, playing a couple of different spots we\u2019re going to ask him to play.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys defense ranked seventh best (329.2 yards per game) in 2018 and fifth (94.6 yards) against the run. In 2019, they\u2019ve ranked eighth (324.9 yards) overall, and 13th (96.9) against the run. The defense was frenetic in a Week 7 win over the Eagles, forcing fumbles on each of Philadelphia\u2019s first two drives and recovering a third later in the game. Dallas\u2019 offense scored on each en route to a 37-10 win.\n\nBut in six weeks prior, the defense hadn\u2019t once helped its offense to a drive that started in opponent territory. They weren\u2019t generating the pressure they sought and repeatedly said they were not playing to their standards. The Cowboys lost three in a row in that time.\n\nBringing in Bennett wasn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cneed,\u201d Garrett said. But the Patriots\u2019 low asking price presented an \u201copportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand,\u201d added Lawrence, \u201cthat he can help our cause in getting to the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nBennett may get his first on-field opportunity Monday night against the 2-6 Giants. The team hadn\u2019t made a decision Tuesday about his availability for the division matchup. But Bennett is practicing toward that goal. Daniel Jones could see a rush featuring Lawrence, Quinn and Bennett.\n\nTheir potential?\n\n\u201cSomebody got to get a sack,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cThey got to beat me to it.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein", "description": "The Cowboys acquired Bennett from New England in exchange for a conditional 2021 sixth- or seventh-round pick last Thursday heading into their bye.", "authors": ["Jori Epstein", "Published P.M.
