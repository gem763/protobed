A gain of that magnitude, if prices hold through Monday\u2019s settlement, would represent the largest daily gain for the most-active contract since Feb. 12, 2016, according to FactSet data.\n\nNovember Brent crude BRNX19, +10.21% jumped $6.97, or 11.6%, to trade at $67.18 a barrel, which would also mark the sharpest daily rise for the international benchmark grade since February 2016.\n\nThe run-up in prices would also place both Brent oil and WTI at their highest levels since around May.\n\nPrice spikes in crude come after a Saturday attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field, which has thrown offline an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom\u2019s crude oil production a day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily supply.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing Saudi officials, have said a third of output would be restored on Monday, but a return to full production may take weeks, experts have said.\n\nAnalysts at S&P Global Platts estimated that Brent oil, the international benchmark, could see a $5 or $10 price surge from its current levels, which could push it to test the $70 range.\n\n\u201cAs such prices are likely to break out of the current $55-65/Bbl options range, to test the high $70s as currently supported by fundamentals,\u201d the researchers said.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it would appear that 3 million barrels will be back online in the next two to five days, but around 2.7 million barrels will take longer due to the unique nature and customized gear at Abqaiq in particular,\u201d wrote Robert Yawger, director of energy at Mizuho Securities, in a Sunday research note.\n\nThe Abqaiq facility normally produces 9.8 million barrels of oil a day and is considered one of the world\u2019s largest processors of crude.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a series of tweets that he has authorized the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, \u201cif needed\u201d to \u201ckeep the markets well-supplied.\u201d\n\nBased on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy said the 630 million barrels from the SPR, the largest stockpile of crude in the world, would be made available \u201cto offset any disruptions to oil markets as a result of this act of aggression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SPR was last made available during the 2011 Libyan supply disruptions,\u201d Yawger noted\n\nThe threat of further escalation involving the U.S. also holds the potential to drive crude prices higher still. Trump on Sunday said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d suggesting that military action may be undertaken. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the attacks, which Tehran officials have denied.\n\nTensions are already elevated between Iran and the U.S. after Trump pulled out of a global nuclear pact and imposed fresh sanctions against Iran.\n\nResearchers from the Eurasia Group on Sunday said \u201cthe scale of [the weekend] attack will encourage markets to re-examine the need for considering an oil geopolitical risk premium.\u201d\n\n\u201cA small $2-$3 premium would emerge if the damage appears to be an issue that can be resolved quickly, and $10 if the damage to Aramco\u2019s facilities is significant leasing to prolonged supply outages,\u201d Eurasia analysts wrote in a Sunday research report. \u201cAt the moment, global balances not as loose as 2018 but not tight either. As a result, the U.S. would only release crude from its Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserves (SPR) if damages to Saudi infrastructure appear critical or oil prices spike significantly,\u201d they said.", "description": "Oil futures surged in electronic trade on Sunday, with West Texas Intermediate set to jump more than 10% after a weekend drone attack on a major crude...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR332_aramco_ZG_20190915222432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
