Ajjawi, shortly after he exited his plane at Boston Logan International Airport. According to The Harvard Crimson, Ajjawi flew in from Lebanon and was questioned for hours by US immigration officers, which included fielding questions about his religion. Ajjawi told the Crimson he was forced to unlock his phone and laptop. The immigration officials then reportedly went on to search through his contacts and social media accounts.\n\nAfter five hours of rummaging, an immigration officer allegedly told Ajjawi she had found posts from some of his friends who were, \"posting political points of view that oppose the US.\" CBP then canceled Ajjawi's visa and denied him entry.\n\nCBP grants admission but will not say why Ajjawi was denied entry in the first place\n\nIn a statement provided to Insider last week, CBP said they had deemed Ajjawi, \"inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection.\"\n\nThat's changed. In a statement provided to Insider on Tuesday morning, a CBP spokesperson said Ajjawi, \"overcame all grounds of inadmissibility,\" and entered the US on an F-1 student visa.\n\nboston logan international airport security More\n\nJeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nThe agency did not respond to Insider's requests for comment asking for clarification on why Ajjawi was originally denied entry but said applicants must, \"overcome all grounds of inadmissibility.\" CBP said Ajjawi was denied entry specifically because of information discovered during his inspection at the airport.\n\nHarvard administrators, student activists, and outside groups rally together to support Ajjawi\n\nWhen Ajjawi was originally denied entry, Harvard University spokesperson spokesman Jason Newton told Insider that the school was working closely with the student's family and authorities to make sure he could enter the US in time for the start of the fall semester.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, The Harvard Crimson confirmed Ajjawi had arrived on campus and was preparing to start classes the next day. Harvard University did not respond to Insider's request for comment on the methods they used to help Ajjawi obtain entry into the US.\n\nAjjawi's lawyer, Albert Mokhiber, thanked Harvard, The US embassy in Beirut, and the nonprofit group AMIDEAST for their help in making sure Ajjawi could enter the US in time for his first days of class.\n\nRead more: Immigration officers refused to let a Harvard student into the US after reportedly questioning him about his religion and his friends' anti-American social media posts\n\nAjjawi's case stirred outrage throughout Harvard's student body.\n\n\"The actions of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection were arbitrary and completely reprehensible,\" the advocacy group Act on a Dream said in a petition supporting Ajjawi. \"Ismail's only 'crime' was seeking an education at one of the world's leading institutes of higher education. Putting aside valid concerns over freedom of speech, Ismail should not be punished for the political opinions of his peers.\"", "description": "Customs and Border Protection finally granted the student admission to the US, but would not say why they denied entry in the first place.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XGK8Ob6ikm_jNH25jx4uCw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/0d43a7512e755b12a19cd9d8db0c602b"}
