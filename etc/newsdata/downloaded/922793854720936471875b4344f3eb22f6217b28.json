Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), who was the first House Republican express openness to voting to impeach President Donald Trump, announced his retirement on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI thought the idea was you came and did your public service and left, you accomplish what you want to accomplish and you left,\" Rooney said on Fox News. \"And that\u2019s what I want to be an example to do. And I\u2019m also tired of the intense partisanship that stops us from solving the big questions that America needs solved.\u201d\n\nThe two-term congressman confirmed his plans shortly afterward in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nThe news came one day after Rooney, a former construction company owner and major GOP donor, told CNN he couldn't dismiss the possibility that the president committed an impeachable offense in his dealings with Ukrainian officials. \"I don't think you can rule anything out unless you know all the facts,\" he said.\n\nRooney, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also called on outgoing Secretary of Energy Rick Perry to comply with a House subpoena and cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRooney told reporters Friday he was still deciding whether to run for reelection, saying it would depend on \u201cfamily things, business, wanting to do some different things.\u201d But he strongly hinted that he was considering leaving.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of a frustrating job for me. I come from a world of action, decisions, putting your money down, and seeing what happens,\u201d said Rooney, who was a successful businessman before coming to Congress in 2017. \u201cThis is a world of a talk. It\u2019s very difficult for me to just stand up and talk.\u201d\n\nRooney, who has been sitting in on closed-door depositions connected to the House\u2019s impeachment probe, has been one of the few Republicans to publicly express alarm over Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine.\n\nThe Florida Republican said Friday he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo, saying it would be difficult for the White House to walk back the comments and that it \u201cvery well could be\u201d a turning point in the Ukraine saga.\n\n\u201cHe basically said it\u2019s a quid pro quo, which is not a good thing,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThe only thing I can assume is he meant what he had to say. ... It\u2019s not an etch-a-sketch.\u201d\n\nRooney also said he was \u201cstill thinking about\u201d whether Trump\u2019s actions amounted to an impeachable offense.\n\nBut Rooney, a former ambassador to the Holy See, added that \u201cevery time an ambassador comes and talks, we learn a lot more.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to me to see this kind of amateur diplomacy riding roughshod over our State Department apparatus,\u201d Rooney said.\n\nRooney\u2019s announcement has already set off jockeying for the heavily Republican southwest Florida seat. It\u2019s a region packed with ambitious state-level politicians, and wealthy potential self-funders who could make a play for the seat.\n\nFlorida House Majority Leader Dane Eagle, a Republican who has represented the region in the statehouse since 2012, said he is mulling a run.\n\n\u201cSouthwest Florida deserves consistent representation in Washington,\u201d Eagle said. \u201cI\u2019m certain we will have a slew of candidates throwing their name in the ring, and at this time my wife and I are carefully considering this opportunity.\u201d\n\nTerm-limited state Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto said her focus for now remains on a special legislative session that will kick off next week. She ran for the House seat in a 2014 special election, but lost in the GOP primary to former Rep. Curt Clawson.\n\nOthers who would potentially consider a bid include state Rep. Byron Donalds and former state Rep. Matt Hudson. And Chauncey Goss, the son of former congressman and ex-CIA Director Porter Goss, and who has run for the seat previously, told POLITICO he also intends to take a look. \u201cThis was pretty sudden and wasn\u2019t on my radar at all,\" he said, but \"I\u2019ll be discussing this with my family and other people I respect over the next few days.\"\n\nThe region is home to some of the wealthiest people in the nation, which can change the political calculus. Clawson and Rooney both financed their own races, elbowing aside candidates considered more a part of Florida\u2019s political establishment.\n\nRooney, for his part, insisted this week he wasn't concerned about invoking Trump's wrath with his impeachment remarks. \u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2019s going to do to me?\u201d he told reporters.", "description": "Rep.
