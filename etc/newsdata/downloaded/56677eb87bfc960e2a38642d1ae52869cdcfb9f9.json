It showed Markle almost breaking into tears when asked how she was doing and acknowledging that it has been \u201ca struggle\u201d to be in the spotlight. She cited being a new wife, new mother and the adjustment to life with royal etiquette. \u201cNot many people have asked if I\u2019m ok.\u201d\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nBritish author Greg Hogben urged people to share the hashtag, and support picked up from there.\n\nSome reactions:\n\nI hope Meghan knows that she\u2019s more loved than hated. I hope she knows that we have her back. I hope she knows that she\u2019s better than any royal there is ( besides H&A) I hope she knows that she\u2019s beautiful.

Look how happy and fun she was. This is the Meghan before the British media started their hate campaign.

Pregnant women need support. Moms with newborns need support. Moms need support. This woman is doing all of this & her life is under scrutiny 24/7. She is amazing! #WeLoveYouMeghan https://t.co/e70AJU3KTn \u2014 its leviOsa\u26af\u035b (@itsleviOsa934) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nI paused outside Windsor castle today and took a moment to pray that Meghan know how loved she is, knows how we stand with her, and knows that for all the support and love she gave her fans for so many years, we\u2019ve got her back like she had so many of theirs. #WeLoveYouMeghan pic.twitter.com/By84VTOJGt \u2014 Leah Rachel (@LeahRachelZeb) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
