His testimony appears to corroborate both a whistleblower complaint lodged by an anonymous member of the intelligence community who was alarmed by accounts of the conversation, as well as a summary of the call released by the White House.\n\n\u201cSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u2018concerned\u2019 today\u2019s Never Trumper witness,\u201d Trump tweeted, without providing any evidence that Vindman has an anti-Trump bias. \u201cWas he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!\u201d he tweeted earlier Tuesday morning, referring to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the leaders of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc.,\u201d the president also wrote, touting the special operations assault that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \u201cThe Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!\u201d\n\nAmong the nearly three dozen tweets or retweets Trump issued Tuesday morning, the president shared posts by prominent GOP defenders in Congress including Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Doug Collins of Georgia, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Devin Nunes of California, and several others.\n\nMany of those messages criticized a resolution by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democrats, set to be voted upon by the full chamber Thursday, formalizing the next steps of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cPelosi announces they\u2019ll finally vote to open the impeachment inquiry,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote in a post Trump retweeted Tuesday. \u201cCodifying a sham process halfway through doesn\u2019t make it any less of a sham process.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, allies of the White House on cable news opened a new line of attack against Vindman \u2014 whose family fled Ukraine when he was a child \u2014 suggesting without evidence that the foreign-born public servant was more loyal to Ukraine than the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from. Like me, I\u2019m sure that Vindman has the same affinity,\u201d former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wisc.) told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his opinion,\u201d Duffy added. \u201cHe has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine. He speaks Ukrainian, he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free. I understand that.\u201d\n\nJohn Yoo, a Justice Department official in former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, was even more explicit in questioning Vindman\u2019s allegiance on Monday evening.\n\nResponding to a report by The New York Times that Ukrainian officials sought advice from Vindman on how to deal with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Yoo told Fox News: \u201cSome people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nVindman, an Army combat veteran of the Iraq War who received a Purple Heart after being wounded in an IED attack, described himself as a \u201cpatriot\u201d in his opening statement to lawmakers Tuesday, obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cIt is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/04/11/bf56362e49129b4d2b1573f51926/191029-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
