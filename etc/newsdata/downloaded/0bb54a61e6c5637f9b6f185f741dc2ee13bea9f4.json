His brief tenure has been characterised by strain with top shareholder Renault SA and tumbling profit. Nissan\u2019s shares have lost almost a quarter of their value this year.\n\nThe worsening relationship with Renault has been a particular concern for investors and has cast doubt on the future of the Franco-Japanese automaking alliance at a time of sweeping change and uncertainty in the global auto industry.\n\n\u201cSaikawa recently has indicated his inclination to resign, and in line with his desire to pass the baton to a new generation of leaders at Nissan, he will resign on Sept. 16,\u201d Nissan\u2019s chairman of the board, Yasushi Kimura, told a news conference.\n\nAmong the candidates to lead the maker of the Rogue SUV crossover and the Leaf all-battery electric car are non-Japanese, women, and those hailing from Renault, the chairman of Nissan\u2019s nomination committee, Masakazu Toyoda, told reporters.\n\nAddressing reporters alone at the end of a late-night news conference, the 65-year-old Saikawa expressed regret for his failure to turn around the firm which he has said had long chased market share at all costs under Ghosn\u2019s tenure, undermining profitability.\n\n\u201cI had hoped to solve all of these issues before stepping down,\u201d he said, referring to the automaker\u2019s problems. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been able to, and for that I apologise.\u201d\n\nStoic and contrite, Saikawa also took aim at his former mentor, saying he hoped that Ghosn and former director Greg Kelly felt regret for Nissan\u2019s current situation resulting from their financial misconduct. Kelly also denies any wrongdoing, as both await separate trials in Japan.\n\nNissan President and Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa attends a news conference at the company headquarters in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo January 24, 2019.

An internal investigation found that the procedure violated company rules, although it was not illegal.\n\nWhile Saikawa has said he did not intend to break the rules, his admission of overpayment has pitched Nissan into fresh crisis and appears to have accelerated the push for a replacement.\n\nThe nomination committee, established in June to find a successor, was now speeding up its search to find a successor from a list containing around 10 possible candidates. The committee is made up of six company outsiders, including Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard.\n\nThose on the list include Jun Seki, tasked with Nissan\u2019s performance recovery; Yamauchi, the COO; and Makoto Uchida, chairman of Nissan\u2019s management committee in China, an alliance source has told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nFUTURE WITH RENAULT\n\nA key question will be how Saikawa\u2019s successor approaches the alliance with Renault.\n\nSeki has been seen as a front-runner to become CEO. Prior to his latest promotion in June, the 58-year-old oversaw Nissan\u2019s expansion in China, now the automaker\u2019s top market. He joined the company in 1986.\n\nYamauchi, 63, is widely seen as a bridge between the alliance partners, and the near four-decade Nissan veteran is known to be well-regarded at Renault where he serves as a board member.\n\nNissan also said that a nearly year-long internal probe prompted by Ghosn\u2019s arrest in November had found that Ghosn and Kelly were responsible for financial misconduct at the company totalling around 35 billion yen ($326.98 million).\n\nNissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa attends a news conference to release first quarter earnings at the company headquarters in Yokohama, Japan July 25, 2019.
