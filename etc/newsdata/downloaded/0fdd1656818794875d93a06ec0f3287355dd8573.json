Lower relative humidity causes brush to dry out faster, creating more kindling to burn when a fire starts.\n\n\"It's not likely to get better as we continue to warm the climate,\" CBS News climate and weather contributor Jeff Berardelli said. \"This will only get worse in the future.\"\n\nMillions in California now face \"extreme\" red-flag warning amid wildfires\n\nHe points out that fire season is about two to three months longer now than it was in 1970.\n\n\"Climate change \u2014 warmer climate and drier climate \u2014 [is] making a huge difference,\" Berardelli said. \"It is a tipping point. It is the straw that breaks the camel's back and makes these, you know, generally controllable fires uncontrollable.\"\n\nThe six most destructive fire seasons in state history have occurred in the last 10 years, and 15 of the 20 largest California fires took place since 2000.\n\nExtreme fire seasons are also affected other factors, such as the fact that humans are encroaching further into previously rural areas.\n\nFor almost a month, millions of Californians have been subject to temporary electricity shut-offs as utilities try to prevent power lines from sparking fires during high wind conditions. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and tens of millions of people are under \"red flag\" warnings.", "description": "Warmer, drier conditions have made California's wildfire season longer and more intense", "authors": ["Natacha Larnaud"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/24/827e0afa-688a-4b8b-b93a-79744ba56f3d/thumbnail/1200x630/5cf86d1ddf8e4a504a537f6e9110f862/kincade-fire-ap-19297501546969.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
