Researchers found that of those patients, only 4% received counseling from doctors urging them to quit tobacco and only 1.2% were prescribed medication to help them quit smoking. Just 1 in 1,000 patients received both medication and counseling, treatments which are shown to significantly improve chances of quitting tobacco products among adults when administered in conjunction with one another.\n\nWhile more research is needed to learn which interventions might be most effective for treating teens with nicotine use disorder, Chadi pointed to existing interventions like nicotine replacement gum, patches and lozenges as tools that pediatric health providers should consider to help young people quit using the addictive substance.\n\nIn the meantime, vaping among teenagers is on the rise, according to a government-funded survey released this month by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA quarter of high school seniors reported vaping nicotine at least once in the previous month, and vaping prevalence more than doubled for every age group between 2017 and 2019. Twelve percent of high school seniors said they smoked nicotine e-cigarettes every day.", "description": "Despite serious risks, doctors aren\u2019t doing enough to help young people quit smoking, a new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/teen-vaping-01-ap-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
