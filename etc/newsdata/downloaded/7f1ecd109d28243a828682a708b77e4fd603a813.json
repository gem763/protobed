The final is set for next Saturday between South Africa and England - a repeat of the 2007 World Cup final in Paris which the Springboks won 15-6. Stay tuned to Sport24 for reaction following the Boks' epic win over Wales.\n\n12:54:20PM The Boks showed great composure in those final 10 minutes. They had to first defend for a period and then took their chance when it came. Francois Louw's penalty on the ground will be remembered for a long time... as well as Handre Pollard's coolly slotted penalty a few minutes later...\n\n\n\n12:52:37PM Somehow, by hook or by crook, the Springboks have won and are into the Rugby World Cup final against England!\n\n\n\n12:52:10PM FULL-TIME: South Africa 19-16 Wales\n\n\n\n12:51:54PM 80'- With time up, Pollard takes a tap and boots it into the stands to end the game!\n\n\n\n12:51:15PM 79'- A power Bok scrum sees them win a penalty!\n\n\n\n12:50:46PM 78'- DEFENDERS BEATEN Wales 10 SA 15\n\n12:50:28PM 78'- METRES CARRIED\n\n\n\nWales 189m SA 283m\n\n12:49:28PM 78'- Wales butcher a lineout inside their own 22m area and the Boks will have a scrum. They can now close this game out with 92 seconds remaining.\n\n\n\n12:48:41PM 78'- KICKS FROM HAND Wales 40 SA 37\n\n12:47:46PM 77'- It's all about the territory game in these last few minutes and the Boks are doing well keeping Wales pegged back.\n\n\n\n12:46:34PM 75' - Pollard nails his PENALTY attempt under immense pressure! SA 19-16 Wales\n\n12:45:46PM 74'- The Boks win a penalty after a powerful driving maul. Pollard, knowing he had the advantage, attempted a long-range drop goal but his effort was too low and hit the bottom padding of the posts...\n\n12:44:06PM 73'- Brilliant work from Louw on the ground as he wins a penalty, redeeming his earlier off-side error... Some welcome territorial relief for South Africa!\n\n12:43:20PM 72'- But the Boks aren't out of danger. Wales with all of the possession now...\n\n\n\n12:42:43PM 72'- After 11 phases of Wales attack, replacement flyhalf Rhys Patchell attempts a drop kick but it's a woeful effort...\n\n\n\n12:40:03PM 70'- Louw just on to concede an off-side penalty. It allows Wales to set up a lineout near the Bok 22m area...\n\n\n\n12:39:14PM With Kolisi off, Vermeulen will now lead the Boks.\n\n\n\n12:38:54PM 68' - Bok subs: Louw on for Kolisi and Steyn on for Le Roux.\n\n\n\n12:35:21PM 65'- Leigh Halfpenny slots the CONVERSION to level matters again. SA 16-16 Wales\n\n12:34:20PM 64'- TRY to Wales as left winger Josh Adams scores in the corner. Good move to go blind at the scrum.\n\n\n\n12:32:39PM 62' - After 21 phases of Welsh attack on the Bok tryline, they can't force their way through. But they have a penalty in front... however, they opt for a scrum...\n\n\n\n12:28:35PM 59'- Wales get a kickable penalty but opt to go for the touchline instead. They set up a lineout five metres out.\n\n\n\n12:27:43PM 58'- Bok sub: Franco Mostert on at lock for Lood de Jager.\n\n\n\n12:26:17PM 57'- CONVERSION slotted by Pollard. SA 16-9 Wales\n\n12:25:57PM For the first time there was some urgency on attack from South Africa!\n\n\n\n12:25:35PM It was set up by a nice break from Pollard, before De Allende rounded off in style. He is powerful!\n\n\n\n12:25:03PM 56' - TRY to the Springboks as centre Damian de Allende forces his way over with a powerful run!\n\n\n\n12:24:13PM 55'- Boks into the red zone after a few promising phases...\n\n\n\n12:22:54PM 54' - Some daylight for the Boks as they win a scrum penalty. It allows Pollard to set up a lineout near the Welsh 22m area...\n\n\n\n12:21:57PM 52'- METRES MADE FROM KICKS Wales 776m SA 607m\n\n12:21:32PM 52'- KICKS FROM HAND Wales 34 SA 28\n\n12:20:56PM 52'- Bok sub: RG Snyman on for Eben Etzebeth at lock.\n\n\n\n12:16:21PM 47'- Bok subs: Kitshoff, Marx and Koch all on. Mtawarira, Mbonambi and Malherbe off.\n\n\n\n12:15:31PM 47'- More pressure on the Boks as Le Roux drops a high ball on halfway. This is turning into a horror show.\n\n\n\n12:14:54PM 47' - It's just a horrible kick-fest out there at the moment. Terrible on the eye.\n\n", "description": "LIVE scoring from the second Rugby World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Wales in Yokohama.", "authors": ["Herman Mostert -"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9383/d181d0d361884e439efd3f568ffad788.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
