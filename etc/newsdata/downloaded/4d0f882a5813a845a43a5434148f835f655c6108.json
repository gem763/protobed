Spend it to treat addiction, experts say", "language": "en", "text": "Angela Mallette never saw opioid addiction coming.\n\nThe civil engineer from Mississippi was 27 and in her eighth month of pregnancy when she suffered a miscarriage. Doctors performed a cesarean section to remove the deceased baby. She went home with a prescription for OxyContin, a strong opioid for pain management.\n\n\"I had no clue how to cope with the situation,\" Mallette said, referring to the grief and depression that followed the loss of her child. \"I thought, I'm just going to go back to work, pretend this didn't happen, and move on with my life. The pills helped me do that, and that's where my addiction began and flourished.\"\n\nWith help, Mallette was able to stop. However, nearly 400,000 people in the U.S. died by overdosing on prescription or illegal opioids between 1999 and 2017.\n\nToday, as the director of a law enforcement diversion program for opioid users who have been arrested, Mallette has a new worry: Will the states and municipalities that are negotiating multimillion-dollar settlements with drugmakers, distributors and other companies use the money to do the most to end the epidemic?\n\n\"A huge concern is making sure that this money goes to help the people that have been affected by this crisis and continue to be affected by this crisis,\" Mallette said.\n\nThe latest settlement was announced Monday: A $260 million deal that avoided a federal trial pitting two Ohio counties against three pharmaceutical distribution companies \u2013 McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen \u2013 and Israel-based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\nMallette and others who have struggled with addiction, along with health-care providers and addiction experts, say money from these settlements should go to:\n\nHarm-reduction efforts such as clean syringe services and wider distribution of Naloxone, an emergency drug used to treat overdoses.\n\nDrug-abuse prevention programs , including counseling by people who have struggled with addiction themselves and outreach to children at risk for drug abuse.\n\nPrograms to help patients reduce or quit their use of opioids , by using , by using buprenorphine , for example.\n\nLong-term recovery support services to help people find housing and jobs, reconnect with their families and communities, navigate the criminal justice system and avoid relapsing.\n\n\"We need to invest in things that show we're treating addiction like a public health crisis. And we're just not doing that right now,\" said Marcia Lee Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Center on Addiction, which joined with other groups to issue recommendations last year on how settlement funds should be spent.\n\nSettlements to fund addiction research, prison scanners\n\nDirecting funds to these sorts of efforts might seem obvious. However, plans for some settlements have prompted questions.\n\nA $270 million opioid settlement that Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter announced in March with drugmaker Purdue Pharma will channel $200 million not to treatment but to addiction research by Oklahoma State University.\n\nOklahoma lawmakers were dismayed they had no role in the spending decisions. In May, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a law requiring funds from state lawsuits settled by the attorney general's office to go into the state treasury.\n\nThat gives legislators a say in spending generated from subsequent settlements, including an $85 million settlement reached with drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals USA in May.\n\nThat same month, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced a $37 million settlement with the drug distributor McKesson. A bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Morrisey to hold onto the money so the legislature could use it to combat the state's drug epidemic.\n\nMorrisey's office said in late July he believed most of the McKesson funding should go to addiction treatment. However, a portion of the initial spending was earmarked for scanners to stop contraband from being brought into West Virginia's jails and prisons.\n\n'People are dying \u2026 right now'\n\nRyan Hampton, the author of \"American Fix: Inside the Opioid Addiction Crisis \u2013 and How to End It,\" is in recovery from heroin addiction. He says these settlements should be channeled to front-line treatment and support programs.\n\n\"Research is important,\" he said, referring to the Oklahoma settlement. But \"we may not see outcomes for the next five to 10 years, when people are dying on the street corners in Oklahoma right now.\"\n\nDuring a phone interview, Hampton questioned early discussions about spending from Purdue Pharma's September agreement in principle to settle a lawsuit with 24 states and more than 1,000 counties, municipalities, Native American tribes and individuals. The tentative deal represents \"more than $10 billion of value,\" the company said.\n\nTax deductions from opioid settlements: 'Clearly a game.'
