Meanwhile, in industry after industry in the United States\u2014the country that invented antitrust laws\u2014incumbent companies have increased their market power by acquiring nascent competitors, heavily lobbying regulators, and lavishly spending on campaign contributions. Free markets are supposed to punish private companies that take their customers for granted, but today, many American companies have grown so dominant that they can get away with offering bad service; charging high prices; and collecting, exploiting, and inadequately guarding their customers\u2019 private data.\n\nIn Europe, greater integration among national economies turned out to be a force for greater competition within individual economies. The very same politicians who disliked free markets at home agreed to promote them at the European level. Why? Because everyone understood that the single market required independent regulators as well as a commitment that individual countries would not subsidize their domestic champions.\n\nAs it turned out, politicians were more worried about the regulator being captured by the other country than they are attracted by the opportunity to capture the regulator themselves. French (or German) politicians might not like a strong and independent antitrust regulator within their own borders, but they like even less the idea of Germany (or France) exerting political influence over the EU\u2019s antitrust regulator. As a result, if they are to agree on any supranational institution, it will have a bias toward more independence.\n\nThe case of industrial giants Alstom and Siemens provided an almost perfect test of my theory. After Germany\u2019s Siemens and France\u2019s Alstom decided in 2017 to merge their rail activities, the EU\u2019s two largest and most influential member states both wanted the merger approved. But the EU\u2019s powerful competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, stood her ground. She and her team concluded that the merger \u201cwould have significantly reduced competition\u201d in signaling equipment and high-speed trains, \u201cdepriving customers, including train operators and rail infrastructure managers of a choice of suppliers and products.\u201d The European Commission blocked the merger in February 2019.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, antitrust enforcement has become less stringent, while the debate over market competition has become highly ideological and untethered from what data actually show.\n\nA central argument of the Chicago school of antitrust\u2014whose laissez-faire approach was influential in persuading American regulators to take a more hands-off attitude toward mergers\u2014is that monopoly power is transient because high profits attract new competitors. If profits rise in one industry and fall in another, one would expect more entry of new firms in the former than in the later. This used to be true\u2014until the late 1990s.", "description": "From plane tickets to cellphone bills, monopoly power costs American consumers billions of dollars a year.", "authors": ["Thomas Philippon", "Professor Of Finance At New York University"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_131216888/facebook.jpg?1572297378", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
