The ice cream machine was never broke, it just takes 3 hours to clean so we used to say it was broke so we didn't have to serve you lot. Cheers x\"\n\nAnd it has been retweeted more than 10,000 times and had more than 71,000 likes.\n\nAnother former worker posted: \"As an ex McDonald's employee, the ice cream machine was always working it just took too long to clean it so we used to tell everyone it was broken hahaha.\"\n\nIn response to the tweet, one user asked: \"I don't understand why you couldn't say it's being cleaned or maintenanced.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAnother former worker replied and said: \"because people don't understand that you can't use it at all when its on a cleaning cycle ... they just think you're wiping it down or something, its easier to say its broken.\"\n\nMcDonald's insists the machines go through a cleaning cycle ever 24 hours.\n\nResponding to a customer's tweet, the fast food giant said: \"Our shake and soft-serve ice cream machines undergo heat treatment cycles every 24 hours - they're disassembled, sanitized and cleaned every 14 days.\n\n\"We're sorry for any inconvenience.\"", "description": "The insider information about McDonald's and its McFlurries and milkshakes has been leaked on Twitter", "authors": ["Catherine Murphy", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716338.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_McDonalds-employees-take-orders-at-the-Union-Square-fast-food-chain-McDonalds-in-New-York.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
