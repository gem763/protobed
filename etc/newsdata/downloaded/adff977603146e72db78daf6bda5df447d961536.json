And for her, that meant going to school.\n\nAt home, she says her stepbrothers and stepsister regularly beat her up. They stole from her and broke her things. Her stepsister poured water in her bed and told Melissa\u2019s stepmom she\u2019d wet it, hoping to embarrass her.\n\n\u201cAt 10 years old I sat in the kitchen with a knife wanting to end my own life because I was so miserable at home,\u201d said Melissa, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her anonymity. \u201cSchool was my sanctuary.\u201d\n\nThough it is hardly a new phenomenon, bullying has finally been recognized as a major public health problem, affecting up to 30 percent of children, according to some estimates. We now understand that children who are bullied are at greater risk of developing anxiety and depression, among other health concerns, and are more likely to skip or drop out of school altogether.\n\nBut often conversations around bullying frame it as something that happens somewhere outside of the home \u2014 at school, during practice or on the playground or bus. Indeed, many of the surveys attempting to measure the scope of the problem tend focus on the school setting.\n\nIncreasingly, however, research shows that bullying among siblings is at least as common as bullying outside the home \u2014 and that it can be equally harmful, often because children feel like they have less of an escape.\n\n\u201cI felt totally helpless,\u201d said Melissa, who is now a mom herself but has only one child largely because she worried about potential sibling aggression. \u201cMy dad worked all the time and my stepmom didn\u2019t care. It was kind of this atmosphere of \u2018toughen up, that\u2019s life.\u2019 But it\u2019s not life. There is a difference between normal sibling bickering and what I went through. It was nonstop.\u201d\n\nWhat is sibling bullying?\n\nA major challenge for researchers studying bullying behaviors among siblings is that the lines between typical sibling conflict and more outright bullying are not always clear. And what teachers, doctors and public health experts working in this area mean when they say \u201cbullying behaviors\u201d is often different than what parents and children mean when they use similar words.\n\nOfficially, experts tend to think of bullying as behavior that is unwanted and aggressive, that involves an imbalance of power (either real or perceived), that is intentional and that is repeated. By those standards, what someone like Melissa experienced in childhood is clearly bullying. But simple sibling fighting is not.\n\nDespite the lack of clarity around terminology, the research that does exist on sibling bullying suggests the problem is widespread. For example, a 2014 study of nearly 400 young adults who were asked about bullying at home and school reported they\u2019d experienced more bullying from their siblings.\n\nAnd it can be equally harmful. A 2013 study that looked at the potential impact of even relatively mild sibling aggression \u2014 so not even necessarily outright, ongoing bullying \u2014 found it can cause clear mental health distress.\n\nSibling relationships are a vehicle through which children learn key lessons about love, conflict and behavior, which means bullying between brothers and sisters can take on a lot of extra emotional weight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a central relationship in your life,\u201d Corrina Jenkins Tucker, professor of family studies at the University of New Hampshire and one of the authors of that 2013 study, told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the longest relationships you\u2019ll have ... It\u2019s where children learn a lot of interpersonal skills \u2014 where they learn to fight instructively or destructively.\u201d\n\nKids who have warmer, more supportive sibling relationships tend to have good friendships, she added, whereas children who are victimized by a sibling are more likely to also experience bullying behaviors by their peers.\n\nBut experts worry that there is still a sense that sibling aggression is simply a rite of passage.\n\n\u201cI would say in the last five-plus years, there\u2019s definitely been increased interest in sibling victimization. There has been a definite increase in studies published by researchers, and I think more parenting programs are including modules on nature of sibling relationships,\u201d said Jenkins Tucker. \u201cSo I think there has been some movement. But there still could be more.\u201d\n\nSo what can parents do?\n\nFor Beth, 54, the most hurtful part of being, as she described it, \u201cbullied, tormented and physically abused\u201d by her older brother in childhood wasn\u2019t even his behavior. It was the sense that the adults in her life who should have been protecting her were permitting it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the way my mom made excuses for it,\u201d said Beth. \u201cShe seemed to think it was OK for my brother to beat up his sister, whereas if it had been anyone else...\u201d she trailed off.\n\nAnd unlike the school setting, where teachers are often the ones to recognize and intervene when a student is engaging in bullying behaviors, there isn\u2019t necessarily another adult to step in. Ultimately, parents have a responsibility to understand the differences between normal sibling conflict and bullying, again by paying close attention to factors like intentionality, repetition and the power balance.\n\n\u201cWith normal sibling conflict, one of the things you\u2019ll see is that there is a relatively even balance in terms of who is doing the taunting,\u201d explained Carrie Goldman, author of \u201cBullied: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs To Know About Ending The Cycle Of Fear,\u201d who says that parents tend to have a pretty good sense in their guts of what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d and what\u2019s not. \u201cMaybe 40% of the time it\u2019s Kid A and 60% of the time it\u2019s Kid B. In sibling bullying, overwhelmingly, one kid is the aggressor.\u201d\n\nParents should also consider whether the conflicts tend to be in response to an external stimulus, like fighting over a toy or the remote (typical) or whether they\u2019re more about personal attacks or insults \u2014 which is another big red flag.\n\nAnd parents should absolutely take it as seriously as they\u2019d take bullying behaviors among peers. Develop an action plan and establish clear boundaries. Don\u2019t be afraid to seek outside help, which should include all of the children involved.\n\n\u201cI really believe the only way to deal with this properly is through family counseling, and that\u2019s work,\u201d said Goldman.", "description": "Inside the hidden problem of bullying within the home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d60113c2500004c006ffc0e.jpeg?cache=rmYcqFzuPC&ops=1778_1000"}
