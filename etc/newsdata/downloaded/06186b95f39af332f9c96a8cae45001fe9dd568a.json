As Senate Judiciary Committee chair, Lindsey Graham has played it safe on the Democrats\u2019 push for impeachment, preferring to criticize their efforts while carefully calculating his criticisms of Donald Trump. Today, however, Graham appears to want to roll the dice on perhaps the loosest cannon of Ukraine-Gate by inviting Rudy Giuliani to explain everything:\n\nHave heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by @RudyGiuliani about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. (1/3) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2019\n\nTherefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns. (3/3) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2019\n\nWhat could go wrong? Well \u2026 practically everything, if Giuliani sticks to his most recent form. After all, this is not an invitation for a monologue presentation, but presumably a normal hearing (open or closed) in which every member gets their opportunity to question Giuliani. Giuliani has not exactly been a model of decorum when challenged by talk show hosts on his claims and assumptions, and while that makes for great television and radio, that kind of undisciplined approach might not work out too well in a Senate hearing.\n\nThe optics are the least of the worries. Once Giuliani starts testifying, Senate Democrats will demand to know precisely what Giuliani has been doing in Ukraine for the last several months, and what claims he has made on Trump\u2019s behalf. That\u2019s an area where Giuliani has claimed attorney-client privilege, but it\u2019s going to be tough to maintain that without losing credibility in defending Trump in other areas. In fact, this might be the very kind of trap that Democrats were hoping to spring on Giuliani in the House. Perhaps Giuliani will be clever enough to avoid the traps, but there will be some pretty clever people across the dais, too.\n\nLike, um \u2026 three of the Democrats\u2019 presidential candidates, for example:\n\nKeep in mind the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee: 2020 candidates Harris, Klobuchar and Booker This would be an ugly hearing. https://t.co/3OHYLLAkLx \u2014 Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) October 8, 2019\n\nUgly? We might even get another Spartacus moment.\n\nGraham apparently wants to show up the House in demonstrating that the Senate can run a more balanced and proper investigation. Given the fire-drill circus in the lower chamber under Adam Schiff\u2019s direction, that\u2019s almost a gimme, isn\u2019t it? Graham\u2019s also likely hoping that he can get Giuliani\u2019s information about Ukraine and corruption into the headlines to compete with the Democrats\u2019 narrative, which has dominated thus far over the past couple of weeks on Ukraine-Gate. If Graham can keep Giuliani focused and disciplined, that might be well worth the risk of opening Senate hearings on Ukraine, but \u2026 that\u2019s not just a mighty big if, it looks more like The Impossible Dream.\n\nNevertheless, Republicans need to start somewhere to change the narrative, as polling becomes more worrisome on impeachment. They can\u2019t accomplish that in the House, so the Senate it is, and Giuliani\u2019s long involvement in Ukraine is the logical \u2014 if potentially the most dangerous \u2014 place to start. Have fun storming the castle, Senator.\n\nAddendum: It doesn\u2019t sound as though Giuliani\u2019s too keen on the idea:\n\nIn response to a request for comment on Graham\u2019s announcement, Giuliani told CNN, \u201cLove Lindsey, but I am still a lawyer and I will have to deal with privilege.\u201d But Giuliani added, \u201cGiven the nature of his invitation about my concerns I might be able to do it without discussing privileged information.\u201d\n\nIf the questioning was only from Graham, sure. That\u2019s not how this works, though \u2014 that\u2019s not how any of this works, and Giuliani knows it.\n\nThat might leave Graham with some egg on his face, and on Trump\u2019s as well. What will it look like when Giuliani refuses Graham\u2019s invitation? It\u2019s not going to look better for Trump, that\u2019s for sure.
