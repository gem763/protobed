Photo: ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHave I shocked you?\n\nJournalists have speculated that each season of HBO\u2019s Succession focuses on one apparent (and flawed) heir to Waystar Royco. There was Kendall, then Shiv, and now \u2026 Roman? In an interview with Entertainment Weekly ahead of Sunday night\u2019s season two finale, Kieran Culkin, who plays the foul-mouthed, dumb-but-smart Roman Roy, told EW that, though he doesn\u2019t know definitively, he would love if a future season focused on the Roy family\u2019s youngest son. In fact, it\u2019s a theory he\u2019s discussed with Brian Cox, who plays Logan Roy.\n\nCulkin said he shared this theory with Cox when they were shooting the end of season two. \u201cI said, \u2018Well if you look in the first season, [it seemed] that Kendall was going to be his guy, and then he wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThen this year, it seems like Shiv is going to be the guy and now it\u2019s starting to look like she\u2019s not.\u2019 And this is before I knew where it was going. I said, \u2018So, maybe next year is Roman\u2019s turn.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerhaps, it is. Even Logan acknowledged Roman\u2019s worth in last week\u2019s episode, saying, \u201cYou act the fuck-knuckle. But you know? People like you.\u201d If this means more brutal remarks from Roman and even more screen-time with Gerri, Waystar Royco\u2019s general counsel and \u201cstone-cold killer bitch,\u201d we\u2019re on board. Culkin told EW that this season\u2019s confusing yet engrossing Roman-Gerri matchup was born out of an encounter he had with J. Smith-Cameron, who plays Gerri, in the editing room.\n\nCulkin said he and J. have known each other for a very long time and that he \u201cwould, in character as Roman all throughout the first season, flirt with her, and she would just sort of flick me away, bat me like it was nothing.\u201d Director and executive producer Mark Mylod told Culkin later that he once witnessed this dynamic play out in the editing room. \u201cHe saw in the edit room that I went up to her, I said something vile, and she just sort of dismissed me, and then as I walked away, I checked out her ass and then turned around without knowing that she turned around and checked out my ass,\u201d Culkin said. \u201cHe said he thought that was really funny, and they talked about that dynamic and thought they should sort of try it.\u201d\n\nCulkin said the show likes to experiment with certain things. \u201cIf something is working, they will explore it a little more, and if maybe it\u2019s not working so much, they\u2019ll pull back,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo, I think they went in this year saying, \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens with Roman and Gerri,\u2019 and then it just started moving from there.\u201d And, boy, the story of the Rockstar and Mole Woman escalated quickly.", "description": "Ahead of the season two finale, Kieran Culkin, who plays the foul-mouthed Roman Roy on HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession,\u201d told Entertainment Weekly that, though he doesn\u2019t know definitively, he would love if a future season focused on the Roy family\u2019s youngest son.", "authors": ["Trupti Rami"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/12-kieran-culkin.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
