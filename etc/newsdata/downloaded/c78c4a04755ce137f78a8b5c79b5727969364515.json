Although made of plastic, the containers are sturdy and can be used over and over\u2014eliminating the need for single-use plastics, while preventing food from going to waste in the fridge.\n\nBut this long-time U.S. brand (with a global business) is taking its sustainability efforts up several notches now through an ambitious, comprehensive program rolled out in April called \u201cNo Time to Waste.\u201d Tupperware\u2019s goal is to eventually eliminate waste throughout its manufacturing and distribution systems, as well as helping consumers to reduce their own waste.\n\n\u201cTupperware products have been designed very intentionally to be extremely durable and to prevent food from spoiling\u2014these are two things that around the world we are known for,\u201d says Asha Gupta, chief strategy and marketing officer at Tupperware Brands.\n\nLeveraging this history at a time of heightened awareness among consumers about plastics pollution, also \u201cgave us a fantastic opportunity to think about design, manufacturing, distribution, and consumption,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cThis has to be inside and out.\u201d\n\nThe No Time to Waste initiative is looking at everything from how Tupperware sources the raw materials it uses to how it can collect and then repurpose or recycle used products. Among its goals is \u201cenhancing the return process,\u201d for all Tupperware products, so that by 2025, 90% will be recycled and repurposed. It also aims to eliminate plastic packaging, boost its use of renewable energy, and reduce its water use.\n\nTupperware's Eco Straws Courtesy of Tupperware Brands Corp.\n\nAmong its initiatives is a partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s New Plastic Economy, which is asking companies for a commitment to create a circular economy for plastic. To that end, Tupperware has a declared goal of \u201czero waste to landfill\u201d by 2025.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s first steps in this initiative is to make products out of a new \u201ccertified circular polymer\u201d created from mixed plastic waste through a collaboration with the Saudi petrochemical company, SABIC, a supplier.\n\nSABIC has designed a way to purify typical plastic waste products like shampoo or soda bottles to the molecular level, so that the resulting resin is food safe, Gupta says.\n\nThe first product made from this material that Tupperware plans to release to the market will be an \u201ceco straw,\u201d a sustainable alternative to plastic straws\u2014the ubiquitous symbol of single-use plastics pollution.\n\nMetal and paper substitutes for plastic straws haven\u2019t been that good, so \u201cwe wanted to step in and provide a solution that was fantastic\u2014it has great design, it\u2019s amazing to use, and it\u2019s made from sustainable sourced material,\u201d Gupta says.\n\nITEM\n\nWhile the Eco Straw and a coffee \u201cto go\u201d cup, also made from the new sustainable polymer, aren\u2019t available to consumers just yet, Tupperware already offers several products designed to reduce food waste and cut energy use.\n\nThe company\u2019s FridgeSmart Collection, for instance, is a line of containers designed by Tupperware in partnership with the University of Florida that has a venting system to control airflow and moisture. The venting allows the containers to extend the life of produce and preserve nutrients.\n\nPRICE\n\nA four-piece FridgeSmart set with two 1\u00be quart small-deep containers, one gallon-deep container, and one 1\u00be quart medium container costs $94 on Tupperware.com. Tupperware products are also available through the company\u2019s three million global sales associates.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nFridgeSmart containers come in various sizes, and can be adjusted with a slide to match the air circulation requirements of specific produce. Like all Tupperware products, the containers have a limited lifetime warranty.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE GOOD?\n\nWith more people shopping in bulk, and storing fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator, the FridgeSmart products (called VentSmart in some global markets) can prevent food waste, which is a major environmental problem, leading to lost energy and resources. (Up to 40% of the food in the United States is wasted, the National Resource Defense Council has found).\n\n\u201cThe venting system allows for food to get the right amount of oxygen in the container, and that keeps it fresh,\u201d Gupta says.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nTupperware has several other products with a sustainable bent, including its Power Chef Premium System, which can process and chop vegetables, nuts, and herbs without electricity.\n\nIn Europe, the company has introduced a line of non-food-safe products made from recycled Tupperware, including outdoor watering cans. \u201cWe\u2019re just starting to make sure that\u2019s something we can start to cascade globally,\u201d Gupta says.\n\nOne of its most innovative efforts is a partnership with a commercial space company, Techshot, to develop a system for growing fruits and vegetables in space for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Tupperware expects the technology in this product, called PONDS (Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System), can be adapted to future food waste products.", "description": "The 70-year-old direct seller is working to reduce\u2014and eventually eliminate\u2014its waste", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104384/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
