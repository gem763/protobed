Democrat presidential candidate Julian Castro swung big in the last televised Democrat debate and missed. Bigly. Now he has lost an endorser \u2013 from Texas, no less.\n\nRep. Vincente Gonzalez (D-McAllen) was interviewed on CNN\u2019s State of the Union and made a big announcement. The lawmaker said he is ditching Team Castro and is suiting up with Team Biden. Worst of all, Gonzalez didn\u2019t talk to Castro about his decision before he went on and told host Jake Tapper about it. Yikes! He justified his snub by saying he had spoken to Julian\u2019s twin brother, Joaquin, who serves with him in the House.\n\nYou can watch the interview HERE.\n\nWhen asked about what he thought of Castro\u2019s aggressive, condescending dust-up with Biden during the last Democrat debate, Gonzalez brushed the behavior off as \u201cfair game\u201d in a political debate but admitted that Castro\u2019s delivery \u201ccould have been better.\u2019 When asked why he decided to make a change in endorsements, Gonzalez said that Biden\u2019s been a statesman.\n\nWhat struck me during the interview, though, was Gonzalez mentioning more than once that he thinks Biden is mentally sharp and in great health. \u201cHe\u2019s sharp.\u201d He also said that he\u2019s met with Biden and he\u2019s met with President Trump and Biden is in better health than the president. Tapper didn\u2019t push him any further on that point. I would have questioned Gonzalez\u2019s assumptions, though, as we see that Trump keeps a full schedule while Biden has taken a slow pace on the campaign trail.\n\nGonzalez said it isn\u2019t just the polling that compelled him to choose Biden. He noted that candidates have to be able to raise money to go the distance in a campaign.\n\nBiden is polling at the top of the Democratic field, and Castro is trailing well behind. Gonz\u00e1lez, in explaining his switch, noted that Castro was \u201cpolling in the low single digits.\u201d He said everyone has to face reality. \u201cIf you\u2019re polling in the low single digits and you\u2019re not raising resources, it\u2019s clearly a recipe for disaster.\u201d \u201cWe need to be cognizant of that as a Democratic Party, wanting to defeat Trump.\u201d\n\nGonzalez was quite clear that his top priority is to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. This makes him one of the Democrats that looks at Biden as the safe choice. It is his \u201cnumber one goal.\u201d He isn\u2019t concerned about Biden\u2019s gaffes or less than stellar performances on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get off-track in the heat of a debate.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement switch must be particularly painful for Castro \u2013 he only had three Congressional endorsements and one was his twin brother.\n\nGonzalez had been one of three Texas Democrats in Congress to back the former San Antonio mayor and U.S housing secretary, along with Dallas Rep. Colin Allred and the White House hopeful\u2019s twin, San Antonio Rep. Joaquin Castro. He was also a rare backer from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nGonzalez is right, though, the field should be narrowing. At this point, the real possibilities for the nomination are Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. Julian Castro hasn\u2019t captured the imagination of Democrat primary voters. That candidate seems to be Elizabeth Warren. Biden is the safe, familiar choice, and Sanders has his loyal BernieBros from 2016. Warren is the candidate who has risen from the rest of the herd and has even overtaken Bernie in some polls. The candidates like Castro in the race are simply running for vice-president at this point, or maybe a position in the cabinet, if a Democrat wins in 2020.", "description": "The writing is on the wall...", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JulianCastro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
