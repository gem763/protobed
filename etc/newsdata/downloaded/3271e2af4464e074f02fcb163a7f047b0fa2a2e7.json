But he was eager to brag about beating Vice President Mike Pence in a recent bike race in Nantucket. He shared his win on Twitter.\n\nI can\u2019t drop many people on a bike these days but I just blew the fuckin\u2019 doors off Mike Pence on a Nantucket bike path. Day. Made. \u2014 Lance Armstrong (@lancearmstrong) August 10, 2019\n\nInstead of congratulations, Twitter users gave him ridicule.\n\nHe\u2019s 13 years older than you and was never a professional cyclist. \u2014 Mrs.Liberty (@LibertyJen) August 10, 2019\n\nA younger man who rode a bike professionally passed an older man on a bike. That made your day.... ?????? \u2014 Q BossyCowgurl (@BossyCowgurl84) August 10, 2019\n\nSooo... the guy who cheated to win all his championships now thinks it's winning to ride a bike faster than a 60 year old who wasn't even trying to race him... got it. \u2014 Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) August 10, 2019\n\nArmstrong later clarified that it was all a joke, and charmingly told his naysayers to \"lightin' the f*** up.\"\n\nSome people can\u2019t take a joke or even having a little fun on twitter. Lightin\u2019 the fuck up people. But seriously, I did blow his doors off!! ???? \u2014 Lance Armstrong (@lancearmstrong) August 10, 2019\n\nArmstrong, who also beat cancer and founded the LiveStrong Foundation, won the Tour de France an historic seven times. But, in 2012, facing an impending deadline from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to admit to having both taken and distributed performance-enhancing drugs (you can see the full list here), Armstrong decided to avoid arbitration and accept the punishment. So, the USADA promptly stripped him of his titles and banned him from the sport for life. He later fessed up to Oprah Winfrey about the whole thing in a defensive interview that did him little favors with his already lost fans.\n\nIn May, Armstrong said he \"wouldn't change a thing\" about how the scandal unfolded. He admits his actions were a \"mistake,\" but it was one he's glad he's made.\n\n\"Primarily, I wouldn\u2019t change the lessons that I\u2019ve learned,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t learn all the lessons if I don\u2019t act that way.\"", "description": "Professional, yet disgraced athlete Lance Armstrong had been pretty quiet .09/02/2019 3:19:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/270/347c8a9f-e5b3-4cd7-8fd7-dab06e145de7.jpg"}
