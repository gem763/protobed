(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY )\n\nFacebook has begun rolling out its new Facebook News section with support from some of the country's most prestigious newsrooms, including USA TODAY.\n\nThe social network has also enlisted The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Dallas Morning News, Chicago Tribune, The Boston Globe, Business Insider and Buzzfeed, among other high-profile news organizations, lending much-needed credibility given Facebook's previous failures to clamp down on the spread of \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to partner with Facebook on their efforts to highlight news from trusted, high-quality publishers for their audience,\" says Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY Network and publisher of USA TODAY. \"It\u2019s also a big step forward that Facebook is investing in trust and quality by licensing content from news publishers for the first time.\"\n\nFacebook is calling this ambitious march into news and journalism a test, for now, made available to a \u201csubset\u201d of people in the nation\u2019s largest cities. The new news tab will appear in the Facebook app on your phone, not on the web.\n\nDuring the initial phase, Facebook plans to showcase original reporting from local properties in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, Miami, Atlanta and Boston.\n\n\"The fact that local news is part of this big Facebook rollout goes to the fact of how important trust is, and that local news is where that's at,\" says Steve Chung, chief digital officer for Fox Television Stations.\n\nAdds Patrick Paolini, vice president and general manager at Fox's WTTG and WDCA stations in Washington D.C.: \"From my perspective, shine a light on us.\"\n\nThe Today's Stories section of Facebook News (Photo: Facebook)\n\nReaders will be able to access content through four distinct sections:\n\nToday\u2019s Stories: A section with human-curated pieces that will be updated during the day.\n\nPersonalization: An algorithmically curated area filled with topics that Facebook believes you will want to read, share and follow.\n\nTopic sections: An area where you can dig deeper into the business, entertainment, health, science and tech and sports categories.\n\nYour subscriptions: Where you\u2019ll find content from paid subscriptions linked to your Facebook account.\n\nOn Facebook News you can control the kinds of stories you'd like to see surfaced. (Photo: Facebook)\n\nYou will be able to access controls to hide articles, topics and publishers you choose not to see.\n\nFacebook says it surveyed more than 100,000 people on Facebook in the U.S. earlier in the year and found that it was under-serving many topics people wanted most in their News Feeds, especially around categories like entertainment, health, business, and sports.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook is offering licensing fees ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for smaller publishers to a few million dollars annually for bigger ones, with much larger sums reserved for major organizations.\n\nFacebook says it has chosen publishers that are in its News Page Index, which was developed in collaboration with the publishing industry. Publishers must abide by Facebook guidelines that address hate speech, clickbait, and other violations, including inaccuracies determined by certified non-partisan third-party fact-checkers.\n\nFacebook also added that the publishers must serve a sufficiently large audience, with different thresholds set by category.\n\n\"We already have a lot of eyeballs on Facebook. This is a nice way to position our brand in a section of Facebook dedicated to reputable journalism,\" says Colby Smith, senior vice president and general manager for ABC News Digital and Live Streaming, and another Facebook media partner. Smith hopes for ABC to eventually provide live video through the new news section, just as it already does through the Facebook Watch video platform. At first ABC News will be contributing written stories.\n\nVerizon-Disney bundle: Verizon customers to get a year of Disney+ for free\n\nHow to get a free Mini: Spotify giving away free Google Home Minis\n\nIn a blog post co-written by Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global news partnerships, and Mona Sarantakos, a product manager at the company for news, Facebook said it will continue to expand the algorithmic selection of stories driving the majority of Facebook News.\n\nBut journalists will play a prominent role.\n\n\u201cWe have progress to make before we can rely on technology alone to provide a quality news destination,\u201d the blog authors wrote. \u201cWhen we started talking to news organizations about building Facebook News earlier this year, they emphasized that original reporting is more expensive to produce and better recognized by seasoned journalists than by algorithms.\"\n\nFacebook says it has formed a curation team to oversee its Today's Stories section. \"This team is independent, free from editorial intervention by anyone at the company.\u201c\n\nFor his part, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has expressed skepticism about Facebook\u2019s involvement in curating news. \u201cI have a quite contrarian view here because I think the more you start to curate, and to select, and to make choices, the more you automatically, and even involuntarily, transform into a publication house, into a media company. And then, honestly, you're just too big,\u201d he said during an exchange earlier this year in Berlin with Mathias D\u00f6pfner, CEO of Europe\u2019s largest publisher Axel Springer. \u201cSooner or later, you will be split up by regulators because they will say there cannot be so much dominance in one company that makes the decisions globally who reads what.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Money & Tech on Facebook.
