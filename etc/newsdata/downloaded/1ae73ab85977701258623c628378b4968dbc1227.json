And now, over 70 female members of parliament from Britain have also taken a stand against unfair reporting of Meghan Markle by the tabloids.\n\nIn an open letter, which MP Holly Lynch published on Twitter, a large group of women from different political parties joined together to support Duchess Meghan. The letter referenced the \"distasteful and misleading nature of the stories\" written about Meghan, describing many reports about the duchess as \"an invasion of your privacy.\"\n\nIn the documentary about her royal tour of south Africa, Meghan revealed to ITV's Tom Bradby, \"I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair and that's the part that's really hard to reconcile.\" The duchess' honesty about her struggle to deal with intense media scrutiny has understandably led many individuals to speak out in support of her.\n\nWomen MPs from all political parties have put aside our differences to stand in solidarity with the Duchess of Sussex today and are sending her this open letter. pic.twitter.com/ytLHG5qPf4 \u2014 Holly Lynch MP (@HollyLynch5) October 29, 2019\n\nThe fact that the letter is signed by over 70 female politicians from the United Kingdom shows that the support for Meghan is huge, with government officials taking the duchess' plight seriously.\n\nRead the letter in full now:\n\n\"As women MPs of political persuasions, we wanted to express our solidarity with you in taking a stand against the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories printed in our national newspapers concerning you, your character and your family.\n\nOn occasions, stories and headlines have represented an invasion of your privacy and have sought to cast aspersions about your character, without any good reason as far as we can see.\n\nEven more concerning still, we are calling our what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories. As women Members of Parliament from all backgrounds, we stand with you in saying it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.\n\nAlthough we find ourselves being women in public life in a very different way to you, we share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation which is now so often used as a means of disparaging women in the public office from getting on with very important work.\n\nWith this in mind we expect the national media to have the integrity to know when a story is in the national interest and when it is seeking to tear a woman down for no apparent reason.\n\nYou have our assurances that we stand with you in solidarity on this.\n\nWe will use the means at our disposal to ensure that our press accept your right to privacy and show respect, and that their stories reflect the truth.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "They call out the \"colonial undertones\" of many tabloid stories written about the duchess.", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F109wIQDH5YmG3eLRYA1Sw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/f06f4a64f8044f523de5cf5547884ffa", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
