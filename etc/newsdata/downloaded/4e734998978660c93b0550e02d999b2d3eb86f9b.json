The president\u2019s lawyer trading barbs on Thursday with fellow Republicans over who was to blame for Trump\u2019s Ukraine predicament, and the president himself talking in wild and ominous tones of \u201cspies\u201d inside his own government, are the clearest signs that the Republicans don\u2019t yet have a coherent strategy.\n\nRepublicans have only begun to sketch out the rough outline of what their response will be to House Democrats\u2019 official impeachment inquiry, which was announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That response appears focused on a three-pronged strategy: discredit the whistle-blower, cast doubt on the most explosive elements of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and slow down and weaken the Democrats\u2019 process in the House with procedural and historical arguments.\n\nRudy Giuliani, an attorney and adviser to Trump, said Thursday that the whistleblower was basing his allegations on second-hand information, a criticism that was picked up and repeated by Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cHis information is questionable. He says \u2018I was not a direct witness...\u2019 and additionally states over 20 times \u2018I was told,\u2019 \u2018I am concerned,\u2019 \u2018I learned,\u2019 and not once did he say \u2018I know,\u2019\u201d Giuliani tweeted.\n\n\u201cUnder Anglo-American law, that is described as hearsay. Inadmissible because it is inherently unreliable,\u201d Giuliani added.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. (Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images) More\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy used the same language in a press conference with reporters. \u201cNot one thing is from a primary source,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s hearsay.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also argued that the reconstructed transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky did not show the president asking for any kind of \u201cfavor\u201d that was inappropriate.\n\n\u201cThe president did not ask [Zelensky] to investigate Joe Biden. What he asked the president of the Ukraine to do is to participate in an open \u2014 from the AG \u2014 investigation of what transpired in 2016,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nTrump\u2019s comment to Zelensky \u2014 \u201cI would like you to do us a favor\u201d \u2014 was followed by a request \u201cto find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people. ... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nBroken syntax aside, the mention of Crowdstrike is apparently a reference to an unfounded conspiracy theory, previously referenced by the president, that Ukraine had a role in hacking into the Democratic National Committee and releasing thousands of internal emails.\n\n\u201cThat is lawful, for us to look to another government to actually participate in an open investigation of what happened in 2016, because we want to make sure that never happens again,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy also tried to create distance between Trump\u2019s mention of former Vice President Biden and Trump\u2019s request for \u201ca favor\u201d from Zelensky.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) More\n\n\u201cWhen he said, \u2018I have a favor\u2019 \u2026 [it\u2019s] 540 words later before Biden ever comes up,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cEverybody has been misquoting here about what transpired afterwards: participate in an open investigation by the attorney general, which is totally lawful, of something that transpired in 2016. Nothing about a further election. Nothing about Biden and the further election.\u201d", "description": "The Republican response to impeachment appears focused on a three-pronged strategy: discredit the whistle-blower, cast doubt on the most explosive elements of Trump\u2019s call, and slow down the Democrats\u2019 process in the House.", "authors": ["Jon Ward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QfaFkIhupEAuEpEzaBYs3Q--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/da247030-e099-11e9-be74-3bcaa16ba2bf", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
