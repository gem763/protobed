This allows regulators to know whom to target when something goes wrong.\n\nThe regime creates subjective standards for banks to act with honesty and integrity, due skill, care and diligence, and to deal with regulators in an \"open, constructive and co-operative\" way.\n\nFinance industry insiders are referring to the new BEAR as the \"FEAR\" \u2013 the Financial Executive Accountability Regime \u2013 although the government is leaning towards the acronym FSEAR (the Financial Services Executive Accountability Regime).\n\nIt is understood the government wants to minimise the red tape burden by limiting the application to relatively large companies that are crucial to financial stability, whereas ASIC has been interested in a slightly wider application.\n\nMr Shipton told parliament this month the new rules should apply to \"as many financial institutions as possible\" to ensure leaders of large financial institutions were legally required to be responsible and accountable for good conduct of their firms.\n\nWhile BEAR is not necessarily inconsistent with these, the feeling is that it is not necessary to add another regime. \u2014 Priscilla Bryans, Herbert Smith Freehills\n\nSmall financial services licence holders, such as financial advice firms and mortgage brokers, are intended to be exempted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the royal commission's final report, Commissioner Kenneth Hayne called for BEAR to be extended to all APRA-regulated entities, such as super funds and insurers.\n\nThe government is going further by extending it to a broader range of systemically-important financial services companies regulated by ASIC.\n\nThe ASX and private health insurers are among the entities that could be captured, as consultations over the coming months thrash out how wide the regulatory net expands, according to government, regulatory and industry sources.\n\nCommissioner Hayne nominated insurers but was silent on health insurers, which are already subject to APRA regulation.\n\nAMP complications\n\nAMP\u2019s sale of its life insurance business is complicating the work, as the government and regulators try to ensure the regime captures all of AMP and its chief executive, not just the subsidiary entity holding its banking licence.\n\nIndustry insiders say the superannuation industry is struggling to determine its response to the BEAR, given it is already subject to strict duties under the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act to act in the best interest of customers.\n\n\"While BEAR is not necessarily inconsistent with these, the feeling is that it is not necessary to add another regime,\u201d said Herbert Smith Freehills partner Priscilla Bryans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe consultation paper is due to be released before the end of the year.\n\nCommissioner Hayne called for ASIC to be given extra powers to jointly administer with APRA the wider accountability regime. As conduct regulator, he wanted ASIC to oversee parts of the existing BEAR concerning consumer protection and market conduct.\n\nThere are worries in the industry that ASIC will use a broader BEAR to lift litigation for offences that are, by their nature, subjective and difficult to define, and could target companies for breaches that APRA might seek to resolve behind the scenes.\n\n'Fuzzy laws'\n\n\u201cThese are fuzzy law obligations, creating duties to be open, cooperative, and to protect the prudential standing and prudential reputation of a firm. No one knows what some of those things mean. And these fuzzy laws have been coupled with significant consequences, large fines and disqualification of individuals,\" Ms Bryans said.\n\n\"When these provisions are enforced by APRA, as a prudential regulator that looks at the big picture, companies are relatively comfortable that APRA won\u2019t use its powers on small matters: accountability doesn\u2019t always equate to a need for punishment when things go wrong; it can mean management identifying a problem and taking ownership of fixing it.\n\n\"The question is, will ASIC, as a conduct regulator, take a narrower view and seek to punish?\"\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s detailed February response to the royal commission's final report signalled that the government would go beyond the Hayne recommendation by not only extending BEAR to all APRA-regulated entities but also introducing \"a similar regime for non-prudentially regulated financial firms focused on conduct\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to ensuring that senior individuals who operate in the financial sector conduct themselves in an appropriate manner and face consequences where they fail to meet these standards,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nMr Frydenberg said on Monday that Treasury was working on a proposal paper on the executive accountability regime to be released for public consultation by the end of the year.\n\n\"As outlined in the FSRC Implementation Roadmap, legislation to implement these commitments will be consulted on and introduced by the end of 2020.\u201d\n\nThe new ASIC-administered accountability regime is likely to select larger holders of the Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) and Australian Credit Licence (ACL).\n\nLine in the sand\n\nAn ASX spokesman said it was aware of the intention to extend the BEAR to market operators, and clearing and settlement facilities.\n\n\"We believe we\u2019re well placed, given the significant work we\u2019ve done through our Stronger Foundations initiative, which enhanced our risk management, governance and accountability arrangements,\" he said.\n\nBanks, insurers and super funds will represent roughly 90 per cent of the coverage, but where the line will be drawn in the sand for roughly the remaining 10 per cent of financial services firms is yet to be determined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanies that have a licence for incidental or ancillary financial services activities \u2013 such as an industrial, energy, property trusts or airlines \u2013 are intended to be exempt from the new laws, sources said.\n\nAs ASIC steps up its legal actions against company directors, Mr Shipton said this month the extension of the BEAR regime would help future enforcement work.\n\n\"We believe that this extension of this accountability regime, so that leaders of financial institutions, particularly large ones \u2013 but as many financial institutions as possible \u2013 have a requirement under law to be responsible and accountable for the good conduct of their financial institutions, is absolutely key,\" he told parliament this month.\n\nHaving regulatory structures in place whereby individual leaders of financial institutions \"are clearly aware of their responsibilities and their accountabilities will go a very long way to ensuring the behavioural change that I mentioned was so important in my response to the last question,\" he added.\n\nCommissioner Hayne also called for BEAR to be expanded so that it covered both ASIC and APRA, something both regulators have said they support as a means of creating more transparency about their own activity.\n\nHe also recommended that someone in a regulated entity was made accountable under BEAR for the end-to-end process of getting a product to the market, which banks are already preparing for.\n\nBEAR, which came into effect for large banks in July 2018 and for small and medium-sized banks on July 1 this year, was modelled on a similar law in Britain known as the Senior Managers Regime (SMR), which is also being extended beyond the banking sector.\n\nUK financial institutions had viewed the SMR process as \"long and time-consuming to implement, sometimes with emotional hiccups along the way when colleagues argue who should be responsible for what,\" Ms Bryans said. \"But ultimately, it has been a useful exercise to clarify ambiguity and most people have said it\u2019s been beneficial.\"", "description": "The accountability regime that governs bankers' conduct and pay will soon be expanded and ASIC is muscling in on the new law behind the scenes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2396%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_9/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1bf988d7ef4739267dcf0521a225e07ec1873c0e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
