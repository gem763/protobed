In comparison the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.49% was up 0.5%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.56% was up 0.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.01% was up 1.1%.\n\nLate Friday, the Department of Defense announced that Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service would get the so-called JEDI Cloud contract, which will allow Azure to \u201cprovide enterprise level, commercial Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) to support Department of Defense business and mission operations.\u201d\n\nAmazon, which had been considered the favorite, and Microsoft were the last two competitors for the bid after Oracle Corp. ORCL, +0.87% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.39% had been eliminated. Oracle had vowed to appeal its elimination.\n\nBut Cowen analyst Nick Yako said the fight may not be over.\n\n\u201cGiven all of the twists and turns of this seemingly mundane \u2018commercial\u2019 purchase (including lawsuits, Presidential & Congressional interest and a SecDef-level review & then recusal), we would not firmly count this in the Microsoft win column until the protest window has closed at the Government Accountability Office,\u201d Yako said, citing similar actions in the past.\n\n\u201cThe next phase of this saga could be an Amazon protest or even a lawsuit after the company is debriefed by the Pentagon on the rationale for its loss,\u201d Yako said. \u201cThe animus between President Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos raises the level of intrigue (especially considering CNBC reported quotes in an upcoming book from a speechwriter of former SecDef Jim Mattis that purports Trump wanted Amazon to lose).\u201d\n\nBrad Reback called it a \u201cgreat win\u201d for Microsoft in that it \u201cvalidate\u201d Azure which continues to gain on AWS. It is estimated Microsoft could make about $210 million in the first two years of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe think there is plenty of opportunity for similar size (or even larger) deals like this available across enterprises \u2014 and that in coming years, Azure has the potential to be Microsoft\u2019s largest revenue stream and profit pool,\u201d Reback said.\n\n\u201cWe believe organizations are still in the earliest stages of their cloud migration and as they continue to digitally transform in coming years, the potential for deals of this size, and higher, will become more common place,\u201d Reback said.\n\n\u201cAs context, two companies under our coverage list, Datadog DDOG, -2.97% and MongoDB MDB, +1.78% , spend roughly $75M and $45M per year with AWS, and they are still relatively small companies (each under $400M in revenue).\u201d\n\nBernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, who has an outperform rating on Microsoft and a $167 price target, said the initial impact of the contract will be small on Azure but the long-term gain is what investors should focus on, allowing Azure to increase scale and improve margins.\n\n\u201cWe see this as incrementally positive to our Microsoft thesis,\u201d Moerdler said. \u201cWe also see this as incrementally positive for Citrix CTXS, +1.16%, Oracle, SAP SAP, +0.68% and VMware VMW, -1.68% whose platform software is available on Azure,\u201d Moerdler said.\n\nOf the 33 analysts that cover Microsoft, a whopping 31 have overweight or buy ratings, and two have hold ratings, along with a target price of $161.03, according to FactSet data.", "description": "Microsoft Corp. shares tick higher Monday after the Department of Defense awards the tech giant a $10 billion cloud-services contract, thwarting rival...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU161_jedi_f_ZG_20191028144851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
