Just four miles of the planned border wall in Texas is on federal land \u2013 the other 162 lie on private property.\n\nFaced with intense pressure to meet Trump\u2019s 500-mile campaign pledge, administration officials have instead prioritized the lowest-hanging fruit of the barrier project, accelerating construction along hundreds of miles of flat desert terrain under federal control in western states where the giant steel structure can be erected with relative ease.\n\nThat has deferred the tougher work of adding miles of fencing along the zigzagging course of the lower Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, the nation\u2019s busiest corridor for illegal crossings. There, along the winding river\u2019s edge, the land is almost all privately held, and the government would need to obtain it \u2013 either via purchases or eminent domain land grabs \u2013 before any construction begins.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chron.Com News Article"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
