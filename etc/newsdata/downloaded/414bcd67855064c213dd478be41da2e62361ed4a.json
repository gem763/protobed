REUTERS/Adriano Machado\n\nThe survey, published as Pope Francis opened the Amazon Synod at the Vatican, found that 7 in 10 Catholics in Brazil believe that preserving the Amazon is \u201cvery important\u201d and 85% view attacking the Amazon forest as a sin.\n\nThe \u201cCatholics and the Amazon\u201d poll was done by the Ideia Big Data Institute and commissioned by the Global Catholic Climate Movement (GCCM) and the Climate and Society Institute (iCS). It surveyed 1,502 Catholics across Brazil between June 1-13 and has a margin of error of 3%.\n\nFor 85% of Brazilian Catholics, the Amazon is vital to mitigate climate change and 83% recognize that global warming is a fact supported by scientific research.\n\nThree out of four Catholics in Brazil oppose ending environmental fines for illegal deforestation, the poll said, and 73% disagree with the weakening of the environmental protection agency Ibama, which has lost resources and enforcement authority under President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThere was no immediate comment about the survey from Bolsonaro\u2019s government.\n\nA majority of those surveyed, 63%, do not agree with the government\u2019s denial of the accuracy of deforestation data produced by Brazil\u2019s space research institute INPE, whose director was fired by Bolsonaro.\n\nSeven out of 10 Brazilian Catholics are against the reduction of the indigenous reservations where the original inhabitants of the Amazon live and protect the forests.\n\nFrancis told the assembly of bishops discussing the Amazon region of South America that modern society should not try to impose its rules on indigenous people but respect their culture and let them chart their own future.\n\nThe three-week gathering, or synod, will discuss spreading the faith in the Amazon, a greater role for women, environmental protection, climate change, deforestation, indigenous people and their right to keep their land and traditions.\n\nIt is taking place at a time when the Amazon is in the world spotlight due to the devastating fires in Brazil. Francis said at the ceremonial opening Mass on Sunday the fires were intentionally lit by special interest groups.", "description": "A majority of Brazilian Catholics believe global warming is a scientific fact and preservation of the Amazon rainforest is vital to reduce the effects of climate change, contrary to the view of Brazil's right-wing government, a poll showed on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438253994&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF97024", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
