But it turns out ABC may have been hoodwinked, according to its own account.\n\nA tweet issued by ABC News on Monday morning reads: \u201cCORRECTION: We\u2019ve taken down video that aired on \u2018World News Tonight\u2019 Sunday and \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy. ABC News regrets the error.\u201d\n\nAccording to National Review, the alleged error was uncovered by social media users who compared the supposed combat footage to a YouTube video of a Kentucky military show \u2014 and it appears to be identical. (National Review credited Gizmodo with first reporting on the alleged error and publishing the videos side by side for comparison.)\n\nABC\u2019s correction is the right move, of course. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the end of the story. It\u2019s yet another in a long series of pretty serious media mistakes that never should have happened \u2014 and, arguably, would not have if appropriate journalistic standards had been deployed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI can\u2019t help but think that part of the problem might be that the video seemed to fit in so perfectly with the narrative that the media and other interests have been pummeling viewers with for a week. Had this video not shown what many wanted to see, it might have been treated more critically on the front end, rather than represented as a great, exclusive ABC News \u201cget\u201d that was shown to millions of its evening news and morning news viewers.\n\nThere may well be slaughters, massacres and abuses in the battle between Turkey and the Kurds in northern Syria. Such events have gone on relatively nonstop in the Middle East for a long time. News coverage, analysis, public discussion and debate are all worthy. Military experts, Democrats, Republicans and pundits all seem to agree that Trump is in the wrong. But under these circumstances, when preconceived notions are being set in stone, it\u2019s all the more important to make sure we aren\u2019t hoodwinked.\n\nIf the video aired by ABC is actually video of a military-type demonstration in Kentucky, there are other questions we need to have answered.\n\nExactly who brought the video to ABC and how did they represent it? What was the process ABC used to try to verify that the video was what they presented it to be? Who did ABC believe shot the \u201ccombat video\u201d? Did they pay for it, or did someone just offer to give it to them out of the blue? What was the motivation of those who misrepresented the video?\n\nMany who I sense never thought about \u201cthe Kurds\u201d a week ago are purporting to speak knowledgeably on the topic, on television and in the press, as reporters and analysts. Lives are at stake and there are questions of freedom, democracy and terrorism, but there is always an element of someone making money at the heart of many such conflicts.\n\nNow more than ever we should be mindful that, like so many others, these are important, complex topics about which competing interests try to further their own narratives.\n\nThe best a viewer can do in this environment is not necessarily believe much of anything presented to them at first blush, no matter how many people say it\u2019s true \u2014 unless there is a way to independently verify what they see.\n\nSharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) is an Emmy Award-winning investigative journalist, author of The New York Times best-sellers \u201cThe Smear\u201d and \u201cStonewalled,\u201d and host of Sinclair\u2019s Sunday TV program, \u201cFull Measure.\u201d", "description": "Journalists must be mindful that there are complex topics about which competing interests try to further their own narratives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
