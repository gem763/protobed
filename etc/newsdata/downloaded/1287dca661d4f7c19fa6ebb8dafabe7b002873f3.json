Moh's Lee and Brad Pitt's character, stuntman Cliff Booth, are pitted against one another in a scene that Shannon Lee had previously taken issue with.\n\nShe told The Wrap in July that it was \"disheartening\" to see her father depicted as \"an arrogant a--hole who was full of hot air.\"\n\nTarantino has defended Lee's portrayal in the movie, saying that he was \"kind of an arrogant guy\" at a press junket in August.\n\n\"The way he was talking, I didn't just make a lot of that up,\" Tarantino said. \"I heard him say things like that, to that effect.\"\n\nAn anonymous source told Variety that the movie will be released in China \"as long as Quentin can make some cuts.\"\n\nTHR reported that there is a \"last-minute scramble\" at the movie's Chinese financier, Bona Film Group, to work with Tarantino to recut the film for it to be approved for release before October 25.\n\n\"Django Unchained,\" the only other Tarantino movie to experience a proper Chinese release, faced similar issues. It was abruptly pulled from theaters in the country during its opening night with no explanation, according to THR.
