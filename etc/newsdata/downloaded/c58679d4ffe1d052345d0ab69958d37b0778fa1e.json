The Turkish government agreed to pause offensive operations for 120 hours and commit to enacting a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\n\u201cWe expect Turkey to ensure the safety and well-being of all people in the area controlled by Turkish Forces,\u201d Mr. Esper said in a statement. \u201cProtecting religious and ethnic minorities in the region continues to be a focus for the Administration. This ceasefire is a much needed step in protecting those vulnerable populations. I also reminded him of Turkey\u2019s responsibility for maintaining security of the ISIS detainees located in the affected areas.\u201d\n\nU.S. ground forces will not participate in the enforcement of the ceasefire agreement, Mr. Esper said, adding that protection of U.S forces during the \u201cdeliberate withdrawal\u201d from northeastern Syria is the highest priority.\n\n\u201cU.S. forces will defend themselves from any threat as we complete our withdrawal from the area,\u201d Mr. Esper said.\n\nAfter visiting U.S. troops and allied partners in the Middle East, Mr. Esper said he will continue on to Belgium and discuss the situation with other NATO countries.\n\n\u201cI look forward to meeting with my Turkish and other counterparts in Brussels to reinforce the importance of ensuring a lasting political solution to the situation in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
