What Limit?", "language": "en", "text": "In one sense, the deluge of support suggested it was just another day in the Trump era. The rhythms were familiar: The president did something shocking, Democrats issued grave statements about the crumbling of democracy, and Republicans rushed to Trump\u2019s defense. Yet today will be remembered as a singular flash point in the Trump presidency for answering whether any red line exists for Republicans in their support of this president. By the White House\u2019s own account, Trump explicitly asked a foreign power to investigate a political foe. But for Republicans, because this request was not explicitly tied to the provision of aid, the call was essentially harmless. It was as though lawmakers had tasked themselves with removing any shred of doubt about where their loyalties lie. By noon today, the deed was done.\n\n\u201cI would at least give some credit to a Republican who said this is wrong, but not impeachable,\u201d Rory Cooper, the former communications director for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, told me. \u201cBut we\u2019re not even getting that.\u201d\n\nThe reaction to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky has been virtually uniform across the GOP, from the so-called establishment to the alt-right. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called it a \u201cdark day\u201d for America, not because the president had bashed U.S. officials in a conversation with a foreign leader, but because Pelosi held a press conference to discuss her concerns with the call at the same time that Trump was representing the U.S. at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nEven the few Republicans who have been unafraid to criticize Trump in the past have come to toe the party line. When Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has softened his stance on the president ahead of his reelection bid, was asked last night whether a U.S. president requesting a foreign government to investigate a political rival was an abuse of power, he dodged the question: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re hearing about right now that\u2019s leading people to ask a bunch of hypotheticals where we don\u2019t really know all the underlying facts yet. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that useful to speculate about a lot of highly particular hypotheticals.\u201d But since the transcript\u2019s release this morning, Sasse has been silent, and his spokesman did not return my request for comment for this story.\n\nBreitbart, the far-right website formerly operated by the onetime Trump guru Steve Bannon, framed the call as more evidence that \u201cDemocrats are reeling and disjointed, rudderless without a clear and concise message.\u201d The lack of an explicit quid pro quo in the White House\u2019s account of the exchange, the Breitbart editor Matt Boyle argued, had \u201cclearly emboldened\u201d the GOP ahead of the 2020 election. InfoWars, a site that routinely peddles pro-Trump conspiracy theories, headlined its main take on the episode as \u201c[Mainstream Media] Deception,\u201d including clips that purport to show \u201cdishonest pundits blatantly\u201d lying about the contents of the transcript.", "description": "The GOP is falling in line behind President Trump's justification of his Ukraine call.", "authors": ["Elaina Plott"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74LX2/facebook.jpg?1569447422", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
