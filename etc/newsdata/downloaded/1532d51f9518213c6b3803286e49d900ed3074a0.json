But Williams marched into a deadly ambush.\n\nHe was killed in the fight, and his troops were driven back, suffering tremendous losses. But history records that those under his command fought bravely and made \u201ca very handsome retreat.\u201d\n\nToday, the college that bears Williams\u2019 name has been ambushed by its own students, and school officials have beaten a hasty and inglorious retreat.\n\nAt Williams College in Massachusetts, biology professor Dr. Luana Maroja wrote online last year that she was concerned about student and administrator attitudes regarding free speech. She gathered more than 100 faculty signatures on a petition calling for the school to adopt what is known as the \u201cChicago Principles,\u201d a statement in favor of free expression developed by the University of Chicago.\n\nMore than 60 schools have endorsed this statement, a welcome response to the disrupted events and other nonsense that have plagued universities around the country.\n\nSome Williams students will have none of it. Maroja says that more than a dozen of them barged into a faculty meeting last November holding signs such as \u201cfree speech harms\u201d and saying faculty were trying to \u201ckill\u201d the students.\n\nAfter that, tensions escalated. The College Fix reports that a professor subsequently \u201cthreatened violence\u201d if Williams adopted the Chicago statement. All this, because Maroja dared to promote the idea that Williams should maintain a \u201cclimate of mutual respect.\u201d\n\nWilliams is a private school, so the First Amendment doesn\u2019t automatically apply to institutional activity there as it does on public college campuses. Still, students should expect that the school would want to promote the civil exchange of ideas.\n\nAnd when discussions devolve into threats of violence, it\u2019s small wonder that students opt to pursue truth via hysterical rhetoric and physical confrontation rather than through discussion and debate.\n\nIf you expected the college administration to stand up for free speech and mutual respect, think again. Earlier this week, Williams\u2019 officials waved a white flag and announced the school will not adopt the Chicago statement but draft \u201cspeaker invitation guidelines.\u201d\n\nTurning away from principles protecting free speech adds to suspicions that there is a free speech crisis \u2013 or worse \u2013 at Williams. Last month, the U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation of the college after its student government denied a pro-Israel student group official status.\n\nAs activity on campuses around the U.S. in recent years demonstrates, when individuals cannot express themselves without fear of harm, oppressors will threaten \u2013 and commit \u2013 harm.\n\nA recent survey of college students found that more than half of respondents say shouting down speakers is \u201calways\u201d or \u201csometimes\u201d acceptable. Sixteen percent of respondents say it is \u201calways\u201d or \u201csometimes\u201d acceptable to use violence to stop a speech protest or rally.\n\nThese responses are disturbing. Civil society \u2013 life in the office, in your neighborhood, at your child\u2019s soccer game \u2013 depends on people tolerating those who do not share their beliefs, not trying to silence them through intimidation or violence. The American Dream dies if we live in fear of persecution.\n\nWilliams officials should take seriously the threats posed to the next generation of adults that come from limiting the ideas that can be considered on campus. The school should require students to attend sessions on free speech during freshman orientation \u2013 and explain that hiding from ideas with which you disagree is a poor strategy for life.\n\nNew policies for public universities in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin now serve as examples of how to protect everyone\u2019s freedom of expression in a campus community.\n\nThese policies affirm the idea that anyone should be allowed to protest or demonstrate in public areas as long as they do not prevent others from doing the same. Moreover, they stipulate that their public universities must be prepared to penalize individuals who silence others.\n\nNo, Williams is not a public school. Its trustees and administrators have the right to set whatever campus policies they see fit. But considering how quickly the campus \u201cconversation\u201d on free speech escalated from a discussion of mutual respect to threats of violence, Williams\u2019 students and faculty are right to ask: \u201cWill I be threatened when I speak out on campus? And do I want to live in a place like that?\u201d", "description": "It became known as \u201cThe Bloody Morning Scout.\u201d\n\nIn 1755, Ephraim Williams Jr., led colonial forces and some 200 Mohawk allies into battle against French and Indian troops near\u00a0Lake George, New York.\u00a0But Williams marched into a deadly ambush.\n\nHe was killed in the fight, and his troops were driven back, suffering tremendous losses.
