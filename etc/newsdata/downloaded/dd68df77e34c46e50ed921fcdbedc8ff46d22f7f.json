Others die from disease in the desert climate, but enough reach buyers \u2014 not at fairs but at invitation-only sales in private homes, says US-based breeder Brad Wood, who sells falcons to Arab clients.\n\n\u201cWild-trapped gyrs are the forbidden fruit\u201d and fetch up to $100,000 (90,000 euros), he said.\n\n\u201cMost of us breeders know that many young Russian gyrs have been smuggled from Russia to the Middle East\u201d to hunt and breed, often to produce heat-resistant hybrids.\n\nGyr specialist Yevgeny Lobkov said poaching on an \u201cindustrial scale\u201d has gone on for decades in Russia\u2019s far-eastern Kamchatka region, where a higher percentage of gyrs are white, fetching higher prices.\n\nLobkov estimated that hundreds are taken every year from Kamchatka, where he works. Poachers are well-equipped and work out in the open, parking their cars along major roads.\n\nSmuggling cases rarely reach trial. In 2013 a man was caught by Russian customs with 29 birds but disappeared after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) embassy paid his bail, local media reported.\n\n\u2013 Factory farm \u2013\n\nRussia\u2019s environment ministry in October announced that a new centre will be built in Kamchatka with the goal of breeding 1,000 gyrfalcons a year, with plans for five more to \u201creplenish Russian gyr populations\u201d decimated by poaching.\n\nA facility this size would be the biggest in the world, effectively a \u201cfactory farm\u201d, said UK-based biologist and falcon breeder Nick Fox, who has worked in the Gulf region.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov praised the centre as \u201cfantastic\u201d, calling it a \u201cbusiness project\u201d \u2014 which suggests the falcons will be exported to the Gulf.\n\nEmirati Environment Minister Thani al-Zeyoudi told the Russian RT channel last month that construction will start \u201cin the coming months\u201d in what he called a \u201cpartnership\u201d with Russia.\n\nShukhrat Razakov, who is set to head the new centre, handled the two white birds on Putin\u2019s Gulf trip.\n\nBut for a facility of such size and government involvement, the project is mysterious, with the environment ministry declining to provide details when contacted by AFP. Several Russian ornithologists said it could adversely affect endemic falcons\u2019 gene pool.\n\n\u2013 Falcon contraband \u2013\n\nInternationally, commercial trade of gyrfalcons is allowed only of birds bred in CITES-registered facilities. It is not clear where the Kamchatka centre would get such birds.\n\nRazakov also runs a breeding facility in Kyrgyzstan, where 200 gyrfalcons were flown in from the Emirates in 2017, according to its Instagram account.\n\nHe owns the Muras facility, which is not CITES-registered, with Rashid Al Kindi of the UAE and Russian Oleg Sharykin, who runs a cement business, according to the Kyrgyz justice ministry.\n\nThe company has no website, and did not respond to questions sent via Instagram.\n\nFox, the UK breeder who worked on falcon conservation in Kyrgyzstan, has not heard of Muras, but called the Central Asian state a \u201cperfect place for bending CITES regulations\u201d.\n\nSergei Ganusevich, a gyrfalcon specialist who advises Russian customs on smuggled birds, said the new centre will likely be launched with birds from Kyrgyzstan, in violation of CITES rules.\n\nHe called the project \u201ccorruption-prone, environmentally dangerous and biologically unfounded.\u201d\n\nIf Razakov\u2019s gyrfalcons are indeed natives of Kamchatka, they can only be contraband as \u201cthere have never been legal shipments of gyrfalcons from Russia.\u201d\n\nIf the gyrs are from elsewhere, Ganusevich said bringing them to Kamchatka would introduce their genes to the native local birds, which goes against conservation ideals.\n\nGanusevich added that locating a breeding centre in rugged Kamchatka smells like a plan to \u201claunder\u201d more desirable wild birds from local nature.\n\nA known smuggling trick is using fake export papers to pass off wild falcons as birds from breeding facilities.\n\nRussia is the only country that has failed to stop the smuggling of wild falcons, said Ganusevich, who has sent two letters to Putin protesting the planned breeding centre.\n\nInstead of building huge falcon farms, \u201call you need to do is to eradicate poaching and contraband, and the gyrfalcon will be fine,\u201d he said.", "description": "Moscow (AFP) \u2013 The king motions for the white falcon to be brought closer and reaches out to stroke its chest, smiling as the bird blindly swivels", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/a43d3f_arab-in-falcons-has-dark-out-control-poaching-smuggling-gulf-region-kremlin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
