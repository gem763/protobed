For the first time in its history, Israel is holding two national polls in one year.\n\nWhy would a country do that?\n\nIt is all to do with coalition building, a vital part of Israel\u2019s political system in which it is extremely unlikely for a party to win an outright majority in the 120-seat Knesset. In April, the prime minister and his rightwing allies appeared to come out ahead. But Netanyahu later failed to gather them into a majority government after he lost support from his former defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman. To give himself another shot, Netanyahu forced parliament to dissolve, triggering repeat elections.\n\nWhat did Lieberman want?\n\nOstensibly, it was over disagreements between Lieberman\u2019s secular party and Jewish ultra-Orthodox politicians. Lieberman refused to join a coalition with them unless Netanyahu agreed to force seminary students to serve in the army. Israel\u2019s deeply observant minority have long been allowed to avoid the draft to study, but the issue has irked non-religious Israelis.\n\nWhat is different this time?\n\nLess than you might think. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White remain tied in polls, similar to April. However, Lieberman\u2019s stunt appears to have won him support, possibly from secular voters, and he might win several more seats than last time. That could award him a kingmaker status, giving him a say over who becomes Israel\u2019s next leader. Meanwhile, voter fatigue around having to do this all over again makes it possible there will an unusually low turnout.\n\nWhat will happen?\n\nThe real battle for power is likely to begin the day after the election when the negotiating begins to form a coalition government. There are many potential scenarios in which both Netanyahu and Gantz may come out ahead. It\u2019s even possible they will join together under a unity government. The big wildcard is another stalemate, which could lead to a third election in January.\n\nHow is Netanyahu faring?\n\nNot as well as he would like, especially in a battle where the prime minister\u2019s own freedom is potentially at stake. Netanyahu still faces three major corruption scandals \u2013 charges he denies \u2013 with pre-trial hearings to begin next month.\n\nAs with previous elections, the leader has sought to appease hardliners to gather support. Last week, he promised to annex a large part of the occupied West Bank and his campaign was slammed for anti-Arab racist messaging on Facebook.\n\nIs the occupation an issue in this election?\n\nDomestic politics in Israel has lurched far to the right, and the fate of millions of Palestinians under Israeli military control has all but disappeared from election campaigns.", "description": "Voters will be asked to choose a government on Tuesday, just five months after the last general election", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb77cc51d048ddfcc44e15286910890af26cf061/0_0_6518_3910/master/6518.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77ed95ca7321829d4227b2a7d7e9a704", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
