Her husband, Spiegel, is one of three self-made billionaires in the world under the age of 30, according to Forbes.\n\nIn 2016, Kerr and Spiegel bought a $12 million Los Angeles mansion together, but the power couple also exercises their wealth by prioritizing health and wellness.\n\nIn an interview for the summer edition of NewBeauty magazine that\u2019s currently making waves on Twitter, Kerr said she was always interested in health and wellness: \u201cI grew up that way \u2013 there was always the philosophy that health was wealth. I grew up in a tiny country town in Australia called Gunnedah in a family that was, and still is, very health-conscious.\u201d\n\nAnd if the interview is any indication, she takes her household\u2019s health seriously indeed. Kerr told NewBeauty she likes picking the pH of their water (\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be going to alkaline because you do need a little stomach acid to digest your food\u201d); diffusing essential oils throughout the house; and mopping the floors with hot water and eucalyptus oil (\u201cIt\u2019s good for the wood and it\u2019s antibacterial. It also smells really nice\u201d).\n\nThe couple goes as far as turning off the power in their home at night, eliminating WiFi and electricity during sleeping hours. As Business Insider\u2019s Nick Bastone previously reported, they also limit their 7-year-old\u2019s time in front of screens, a practice many Silicon Valley parents are now favoring.\n\nKerr also noted in the interview that she has an electromagnetic field detector, and had their home inspected by a professional who looks for EMF waves. The World Health Organization has deemed this health practice excessive, concluding that \u201ccurrent evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields.\u201d\n\nWellness is the ultimate status symbol in 2019\n\nReactions to the interview clip that New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz posted to Twitter on September 24 ranged from the concerned to the incredulous.\n\nSome people said they hoped the couple didn\u2019t have a pet.\n\nEucalyptus oil? Hope she doesn't have a dog. \u2014 it's not a transcript neets (@nycneets) September 24, 2019\n\nOthers couldn\u2019t get past the part of the interview where Kerr likened the state of her home at night, with most of its power turned off, to \u201cgoing camping.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about how she compares turning off most of the electricity in her home to camping. It\u2019s been hours and yet I cannot forget. \u2014 Rachel Metz (@rachelmetz) September 24, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s like camping, in Malibu, in the living room of a 16 million dollar house, if you were 8 years old. \u2014 Nickolas Jensen (@NickolasJensen) September 25, 2019\n\nOthers questioned the part of the interview where Kerr talked about mopping the floors.\n\nRepresentatives for Kerr didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on the couple\u2019s wellness practices.\n\nBut whether or not people are buying into Kerr\u2019s professed wellness habits, the lifestyle she has described is part of a larger trend. As Business Insider\u2019s Hillary Hoffower previously reported, \u201cLuxury goods are out, and luxury lifestyles are in.\u201d These lifestyles are largely marked by discreet wealth: Rather than spending money on fancy cars and logo-ridden accessories, the wealthy are investing in education, security, and wellness.\n\nAnd Spiegel and Kerr are far from the only wealthy Silicon Valley residents who are known to have extreme habits when it comes to health, wellness, and diet.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey is said to eat only one meal a day during the week and to abstain from eating almost all weekend, only eating a meal on Sunday evening. Tesla founder Elon Musk is said to work out twice a day. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg avoids cluttering his thoughts by wearing the same outfit of jeans, sneakers, and a gray T-shirt every single day.\n\nThese health practices all fit into the trend of health serving as a status symbol, and it doesn\u2019t stop at Silicon Valley. Millennials are pouring their money into expensive gym memberships and dishing out serious cash for boutique fitness classes.\n\nMeanwhile, developers too, are taking note: New luxury apartment buildings across the US are foregoing flashy amenities like car-carrying elevators and instead focusing on amenities that promote healthy lifestyles, like outdoor yoga decks, private parks, and so-called tranquility gardens.", "description": "Business Insider - Miranda Kerr told NewBeauty that she and Evan Spiegel turn off all the electricity in their home at night, except for the fridge and security cameras..
