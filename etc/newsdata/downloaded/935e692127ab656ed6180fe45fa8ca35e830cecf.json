Mark Meadows, one of the most conservative members of the House, reacted Thursday to the death of Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, a progressive Democrat who chaired the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee. \u201cI will miss him dearly,\u201d he said.\n\nMeadows was one of many Republicans who paid tribute to Cummings, a testament to his ability to build friendships across the aisle in an era when the parties stay poles apart. Even President Donald Trump, who had disparaged Cummings\u2019s hometown of Baltimore and was the target of his investigations, called Cummings \u201ca highly respected political leader\u201d and ordered flags at the White House lowered in tribute.\n\nAt the Capitol, where flags also were lowered, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Cummings as \u201ca living legend in his native Baltimore\u201d and said he \u201ccounted close friends and admirers from all across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nMeadows, a leader of the House Freedom Caucus and one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders, considered Cummings one of his best friends. It was a feeling that Cummings shared despite their obvious differences and more than a few raised eyebrows from Democrats who view the North Carolina Republican with suspicion.\n\nThe men\u2019s friendship drew national attention earlier this year after Cummings helped resolve a verbal dispute between Meadows and Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan during an Oversight hearing.\n\n\u201cThere was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings,\u201d Meadows tweeted Thursday. \u201cI am heartbroken for his wonderful family and staff.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no Republican exemplified Cummings\u2019s ability to reach across the aisle than former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.\n\nGowdy chaired the special House committee that investigated the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, while Cummings served as the panel\u2019s top Democrat. The men were paired again when Gowdy chaired the House Oversight panel, where Cummings served as top Democrat before taking over as chairman in January.\n\nGowdy said on Twitter that Cummings was \u201cone of the most powerful, beautiful & compelling voices in American politics,\u201d and said his authenticity and sincerely held beliefs were an inspiration to all.\n\nWhile the two men rarely agreed on politics - and sparred frequently on the Benghazi panel - \u201cwe never had a cross word outside of a committee,\u201d Gowdy said, praising Cummings for \u201ca unique ability to separate the personal from the work.\u201d\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Cummings\u2018 roots were in South Carolina, where his sharecropper parents lived before moving the family to Maryland. Noting those humble beginnings, Gowdy said Cummings overcame a series of external obstacles and roadblocks \u201cand sometimes internal doubt that whispered in the ear of a young Elijah Cummings\u201d to become a lawyer, congressman and \u201cone of the most powerful political figures of his time.\u201d\n\nWhile Cummings was \u201ca proud progressive with a booming, melodious voice who found himself in the middle of most major political stories over the past decade,\u201d his legacy also includes the path he took to get there, Gowdy said.\n\nThat path was \u201cfilled with pain, prejudice, obstacles and doubt that he refused to let stop him,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cHis legacy is perseverance. His legacy is fighting through the pain. His legacy to me, above all else, was his faith.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who also served on the Benghazi panel, called Cummings \u201ca dedicated public servant\u201d and said he was saddened at his death.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, another arch-conservative and a member of the Oversight panel, called Cummings \u201cupfront, gracious and caring\u201d and tweeted a picture of Cummings posing with Roy\u2019s son.\n\nEven Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fiery Florida Republican known as a Democratic nemesis, postponed a news conference planned Thursday to complain about the impeachment inquiry, citing respect for Cummings.\n\n\u201cMany are in mourning and we hope that peace and comfort can enter the hearts of those who cared for Elijah,\u201d Gaetz said in a tweet.\n\nAfter the incident with Meadows and Tlaib, in which Tlaib accused Meadows of a \u201cracist act\u201d in bringing forth a black woman to defend Trump, Cummings suggested his friendship with Meadows should be a model for others.\n\n\u201cWe need to get away from party and deal with each other as human beings,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Heartbroken.\" That's how North Carolina Rep.
