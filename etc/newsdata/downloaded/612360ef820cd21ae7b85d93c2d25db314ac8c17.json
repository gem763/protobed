CPPIB, which typically likes to make an investment of $C500 million, has invested in renewable energy projects in the US, Europe and emerging markets such as Brazil.\n\nUnfortunately, it has yet to find an opportunity here that offers the scale it is seeking.\n\n\"If there is a scale platform that comes along, then we would certainly be interested in that,\" Mr Machin said.\n\nCPPIB is an investor in carbon capture infrastructure, having invested more than $C300 million in the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line.\n\nThe pipeline will take about 20 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions produced by the oil sands industry and inject them into ageing reservoirs.\n\nMr Machin said there were \"some provincial subsidies to make the economics work\".", "description": "Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CEO Mark Machin says Australia is the \"poster child\" for asset recycling, thanks to regulatory and tax policy certainty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2908%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_539%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b1943feb829927825a2dcae16246935939a7fccb", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
