Specifically, it\u2019s the nice chunky number of candles on the birthday cake belonging to \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d, the Quentin Tarantino classic that was released in the UK a quarter-century ago this week (on Oct 21 1994). You remember \u2013 Uma Thurman with a black bob, Samuel L Jackson as a fiery hitman, swearing galore. A good reason for travel? Absolutely. And if any of you readers move from this page, I\u2019ll\u2026 sorry, got distracted there. Firstly, you need a trip to LA, where the film is set. A week\u2019s stay at the five-star Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, flying from Heathrow on Nov 16, starts at \u00a32,519pp through Virgin Holidays (virginholidays.co.uk).\n\nWaldorf Astoria Beverly Hills Credit: JAN SCHUENKE More\n\nFear my Roth\n\nYou have to work to find \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d sites. Jack Rabbit Slims, the retro diner where Uma Thurman and John Travolta dance? A set. The Hawthorne Grill, robbed by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer at the start? Demolished. Still, you can spot gangster Marsellus Wallace\u2019s palatial pad at 1541 Summitridge Drive in Beverly Hills \u2013 and the home of Tarantino\u2019s cameo character Jimmie Dimmick at 4149 Kraft Avenue in Studio City. Viator offers a \u201cDowntown Los Angeles Filming Locations Walking Tour\u201d (viator.com; ref: 7304P4) for \u00a318.\n\nRoyale flush\n\nThe scene where Jackson and Travolta discuss the alternative French name for a certain global-brand burger has made \u201cRoyale with Cheese\u201d part of cinematic lore. Keen to try an LA version? You can order one at The Oinkster (theoinkster.com) \u2013 a \u201cslow fast food\u201d specialist in Eagle Rock. Technically, it packs a third of a pound of beef (not a quarter) for its $13 (\u00a310) cost, but you don\u2019t want to argue with Samuel on this one.\n\nPink pound\n\nIf you want coffee in a Tarantino-linked diner, you\u2019re better to switch your attention to 1992\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d \u2013 minus the ear-severing torture. Pat & Lorraine\u2019s, where the robbers chunter about everything from Madonna to tipping etiquette, is alive and serving at 4720 Eagle Rock Boulevard. Please do leave a tip \u2013 whatever Mr Pink may say.\n\nBride on time\n\nTarantino\u2019s \u201cKill Bill: Volume 1\u201d (2003) \u2013 a lush tribute to martial arts movies \u2013 has Thurman as The Bride, an assassin hunting the colleagues who tried to kill her. Her mission takes her to Japan in search of a suitable sword. She finds it in Okinawa, the country\u2019s most gorgeous archipelago. Want to see it sub-aqua style? Try Inside Japan Tours\u2019s 13-night \u201cDiving Subtropical Japan\u201d break \u2013 from \u00a34,000pp, flights extra (insidejapantours.com).\n\nStory continues", "description": "As anniversaries go, 25 is a nice chunky number.
