(Jabin Botsford/The Post)\n\nCongress is back from its August recess, and lawmakers face public demands for action on issues as varied as health care, infrastructure, gun safety and trade. Legislators face at least one set of \u201cmust pass\u201d agenda items: 12 spending bills that need to be enacted into law by Oct. 1 or the federal government will shut down.\n\nWhat else is Congress likely to work on? Keep your eyes on party leaders\u2019 signals. Once, Congress\u2019s committees incubated policy solutions. But congressional leaders have steadily reduced the power of committee chairs over the past two decades, bringing that power to a new low in the 115th Congress (2017-18). Party leaders now drive the agenda. To see what, if anything, might happen in Congress this fall, listen to what the House Democratic and Senate Republican leaderships are pushing.\n\nHere\u2019s how we identify effective lawmakers\n\nTo figure out where legislative power lies today, we tracked all 248,915 public bills introduced in the House and Senate since the early 1970s. We coded the bills for their substantive importance and how far each bill made it through the legislative process toward enactment into law. We tied each bill to its sponsor and then used data on bill progress to identify the most effective lawmakers in Congress.\n\nUnsurprisingly, majority party members outperform those in the minority, and senior members outperform freshmen. Committee and subcommittee chairs outperform rank and file committee members, as do those in the majority party\u2019s leadership. For example in the 115th Congress, Reps. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) and Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairmen of the House committees on Homeland Security and the Judiciary, respectively, managed to move more bills toward law than almost any other legislators in the House. On the Senate side, Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and recently retired Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who chaired the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Finance, respectively, were the most effective lawmakers.\n\n[The Pentagon is moving money to pay for Trump's border wall. Here are the consequences.]\n\nCommittee and subcommittee chairs (especially in the House) have always been relatively powerful compared to other members of Congress. But according to our Legislative Effectiveness Scores between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, rank-and-file members in the House performed essentially the same whether they were in the majority or minority party. While members of the majority party were, on average, more effective than minority-party members at advancing their bills through the lawmaking process, that boost came not from the rank and file but from the powerful committee and subcommittee chairs \u2014 all of whom were members of the majority party.\n\nParty leaders now eclipse committee chairs as more effective lawmakers\n\nAs the figure below shows, chairs no longer stand out as more effective lawmakers than party leaders.\n\n\n\n(Figure by the authors.) (Craig Volden & Alan E. Wiseman/Craig Volden & Alan E. Wiseman)\n\nThe scores we released this year show that committee chairs\u2019 power continues to decline. That decline slowed briefly after switches in party control of the House in 2007 (to Democrats) and 2011 (to Republicans) \u2014 perhaps because these new majority parties were slow to consolidate agenda-setting powers in the hands of their leadership immediately after taking the House. But in 2017-18, chairs\u2019 lawmaking influence had fallen to just a third of its 1981 peak.\n\nWhy the decline? When Republicans gained control of the House in 1995, Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) sought to consolidate power with Republican leadership, and pushed through changes. Most significantly, Republicans imposed term limits on committee chairs. That diluted their power; fellow members of Congress knew that the chairs\u2019 time pounding the gavel would be relatively brief. These changes reduced expertise \u2014 and limited Congress\u2019s overall ability to solve policy problems.\n\nFurther, as Democrats and Republicans have battled for control of Congress, each party has sought to advance a common and unified message \u2014 often placing electioneering over policymaking. To maintain unity in messaging, party leaders have set the committees\u2019 agenda \u2014 and reduced committee chairs\u2019 power and effectiveness.\n\n[No, Congress won't pass gun background checks 'like we've never had before.' Here's why.]\n\nParty leaders\u2019 competing agendas this fall will likely prevent much action\n\nUntil 1994, as we tried to understand what Congress might do in the fall, we would have spent August looking over recent committee actions. We would have focused on how experts weighed proposals\u2019 costs and benefits, and examined how chairs were prioritizing different bills as part of their broader agendas and negotiating with their committee members of the specific legislative details of potential policy solutions.\n\nBut with the chairs\u2019 and committees\u2019 waning influence, we now look to party leaders. Those leaders often seem to be focused on proposals that will help them keep control of the House or the Senate.\n\nFor instance, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been publicly pushing the Senate to take up the House\u2019s gun legislation \u2014 a focus that will likely highlight differences between the parties\u2019 priorities.\n\nThat\u2019s not true on everything. For example, both parties seem interested in negotiating a revamped North America trade deal, lowering drug pricing and eliminating surprise billing for medical treatments. Given that Democrats control the House and Republicans control the Senate, however, we can expect nothing to happen on many of these issues. If congressional leaders are aiming primarily at winning elections, compromise is counterproductive. Only one party can win the chamber \u2013 and if that involves demonizing and defeating the other party\u2019s proposals, there\u2019s little incentive to make a deal.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true because President Trump will likely oppose the House Democrats\u2019 proposals. As a result, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is likely to ignore most bills that the House passes, knowing they would face a veto. Democrats, in turn, will likely ignore Trump\u2019s and Senate Republicans\u2019 proposals, including those dealing with Native American relations, drought relief in the Western states, and telephone robocalls. And proposals addressing major policy challenges that majorities of Americans might support will likely continue to get short shrift until we see a renewed cultivation of independent sources of policymaking expertise in Congress among individual lawmakers and their staffs.\n\nDon\u2019t miss anything!
