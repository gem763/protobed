(Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters)\n\nAn anonymous official in Boris Johnson\u2019s office told broadcast reporters on Tuesday that negotiations with European leaders over Brexit were \u201cessentially impossible\u201d after the British prime minister concluded a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nEuropean officials charged that Johnson was launching a new \u201cblame game\u201d strategy meant to confuse voters over who was responsible for the breakdown in talks.\n\nThe hazy smoke signals from 10 Downing Street increased the possibility that Britain will exit the European Union at the end of October without a deal of any kind. That was once seen as a doomsday scenario, but it has now been embraced by Johnson, who has promised that Britain will leave the trading bloc \u201cdo or die\u201d in three weeks.\n\nAn anonymous source in Johnson\u2019s office briefed British broadcasters about a morning call between Johnson and Merkel, asserting that the Europeans would not budge an inch.\n\n\u201cIt was a very useful and clarifying moment in all sorts of ways,\u201d the British official was quoted as saying. \u201cIf this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now but ever.\u201d\n\nThe statement from London caused bafflement and pushback in Europe.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\u201d tweeted European Council President Donald Tusk. \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d Tusk challenged Johnson, mimicking the prime minister\u2019s frequent use of Latin in his remarks. \u201cQuo Vadis\u201d means \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Johnson\u2019s official spokesman told reporters that \u201cdiscussions are ongoing in Brussels\u201d but also stressed that they were at a \u201ccritical point\u201d and that a compromise must now come from Europe.\n\nAfter Johnson submitted Brexit proposals last week that crossed E.U. red lines, European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said it was on the British side that additional work needed to happen.\n\n[E.U. rejects Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposal, raising prospect of chaotic break within weeks]\n\nJohnson faces a series of deadlines. The European Council meets next week \u2014 one of the last possible times to approve a tweaked deal. The British Parliament also passed a law ordering Johnson to ask the E.U. for a Brexit delay if he has not sealed a deal with the bloc by Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cMerkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the E.U., they could do it, no problem. But the U.K. cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever,\u201d the British source was quoted as saying.\n\nMerkel\u2019s office remained tight-lipped, and her spokesman did not immediately return calls on Tuesday. But the skepticism from Europe was quick.\n\nThe British description of the call did not sound like language the German chancellor would use, diplomats pointed out.\n\nOver the past three years, Merkel has consistently allowed for more talks, more time for Britain to figure out what it wants from Brexit and to offer solutions.\n\nHow to tackle the issue of Northern Ireland, and avoid the reintroduction of customs checks with the Republic of Ireland, which will remain part of the E.U., has been one of the thorniest complications in reaching a deal on Brexit.\n\nThe 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought an end to a hard border there, after decades of sectarian conflict, and there are fears that bringing back a border would not only disrupt lives and business but also be a magnet for new violence.\n\nThe E.U. has been critical of Johnson\u2019s proposal to reintroduce customs checks.\n\nThe Merkel call made clear that Europe is \u201cwilling to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement,\u201d the anonymous source in Johnson\u2019s office said.\n\nUse of words such as \u201ctorpedo\u201d suggested to analysts that the briefing was deeply partisan.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. government\u2019s attempt to shift the blame for the Brexit fiasco to anyone but themselves \u2014 today it\u2019s Merkel \u2014 is pathetically transparent,\u201d said Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who opposes both Johnson and Brexit.\n\nBooth reported from London.
