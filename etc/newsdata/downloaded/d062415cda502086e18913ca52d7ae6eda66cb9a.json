You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nResponding to the news of the two letters, Ms Cherry \u2013 who led a successful legal action against Mr Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension of parliament \u2013 said: \u201dThis is pathetic. Boris Johnson promised the Scottish court he would comply with the Benn Act and not seek to frustrate it.\n\n\u201cLooks like he\u2019s breaking both promises. Fortunately, no need to raise new proceedings \u2013 our existing case is back in court on Monday.\u201d\n\nIn his signed letter, Mr Johnson wrote that the request for a Brexit extension would be submitted not by him, but by the UK\u2019s permanent representative in Brussels Sir Tim Barrow.\n\nHe said he remained confident that he can complete the process of ratifying the Brexit deal reached with the other 27 EU states last Thursday by the end of the month.\n\nAnd he said: \u201cWhile it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming prime minister - and made clear to parliament again today - my view, and the government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners and the relationship between us.\n\n\u201cWe must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship.\u201d\n\nIn an apparent hint to Brussels to take its time over responding, Mr Johnson said he recognised that a new summit of EU leaders may be needed to consider the extension response, and said that he would be happy to attend to answer questions.\n\nBut Mr Tusk appeared to indicate that he would act swiftly, announcing on Twitter: \"The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent two letters to European Council president Donald Tusk \u2013 an unsigned message relaying parliament\u2019s request for an extension to Brexit and a letter from him setting out why he does not believe delay would be in the interests of the EU or UK.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/26/17/breaking-4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
