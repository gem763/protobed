Both leaders took the opportunity to practice their key election messaging.\n\nDespite the vote being pitched by all sides as a chance to unblock Brexit paralysis, it was clear the leaders of both main parties plan on the campaign being about much more than the U.K.'s exit from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has called for full market access to our NHS \u2014 which would mean prices for some of our most important medicines increasing up to sevenfold,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cOur health service is in more danger than at any other time in its glorious history because of his government, his attitudes and the trade deals he wants to strike.\u201d\n\nJohnson emphasized the Conservatives\u2019 reputation for economic competence, and accused Corbyn of peddling \u201ceconomic catastrophe\u201d and \u201cpolitical disaster.\u201d The Labour leader \u201cwould ruin this economy and ruin our ability to fund the NHS,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prime minister said Labour is planning on \u201cconsigning next year, which should be a wonderful year for our country, to two more referendums\u201d \u2014 one on Brexit and one on Scottish independence. Corbyn has said that although he opposes the breakup of the U.K., Westminster should not stand in the way of a second referendum in Scotland.\n\n\u201cDespite the prime minister\u2019s denials, the NHS is up for grabs by U.S. corporations in a Trump-style U.S. trade deal,\u201d Corbyn said. He said a Labour government offered \u201ca once in a generation chance\u201d of ending privatization and investing more in the health service.\n\nThe spat comes off the back of revelations in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary that U.K. and U.S. trade officials have repeatedly discussed the cost of medicines.\n\nThere is concern that the U.S. government and pharmaceutical industry want the NHS to pay more for drugs manufactured across the Atlantic, which are sold much more expensively there. Labour is seeking to capitalize on consistent polling that suggests voters trust it with the NHS much more that they do the Tories.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said \u201cvoters deserve better than a choice between the two tired old parties.\u201d\n\nBrexit was consigned to just a handful of direct mentions from Johnson, who said Corbyn is \u201crefusing to respect the verdict of the people in the referendum of the EU.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Leaders of both main parties focus on health care during House of Commons clash.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175873457-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
