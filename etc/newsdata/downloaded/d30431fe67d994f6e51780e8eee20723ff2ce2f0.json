They were married in 1960 and separated in 1971 when Fosse\u2019s womanizing finally took its toll.\n\nWilliams credited FX and to Fox 21 Television Studios for showing her respect by giving her extra dance classes, voice lessons and better wigs and false teeth when she asked, regardless of cost. She also pointed out that she was paid as much as Rockwell.\n\nWilliams infamously received just $1,000 to reshoot scenes from 2017\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d while co-star Mark Wahlberg negotiated $1.5 million for the added scenes. Williams has said she felt paralyzed after learning of the disparity.\n\n\u201cThe next time a woman - and especially a woman of color because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart - tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her. Believe her,\u201d Williams said Sunday.\n\n\u201cBecause one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\u201d\n\nBefore she left the stage, Williams dedicated her win to her daughter. \u201cMatilda, this is for you, like everything else,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michelle Williams said in her Emmy-winning speech that women need to be listened to and fairly compensated for their work.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/2019_primetime_emmy_awards_-_arrivals_63081_c0-181-3326-2120_s1770x1032.jpg?95e249f3830dd80b018fa1df52b879d2b19e0cd6", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
