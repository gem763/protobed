I know that's such a clich\u00e9 but it's been not for a lack of ideas or a want to make the album.\"\n\nCatherine Marks, the album's award-winning producer who's also worked with Kanye and Blaenavon's label mates Foals, says she doesn't think there will \"ever be a record as hard as that to make\".\n\n\"I never thought I wasn't going to be able to deliver the record, it was more, 'Am I being responsible if I carry on?' - because of Ben's health.\n\n\"It was hard for all of us but I think it helped him. It was an opportunity to make a second record, not many people get to do that.\n\n\"I was there to help them achieve that no matter what.\"\n\nImage caption Producer Catherine Marks finds it \"surprising\" how much emotional support artists need in the studio\n\nToday, Ben says he's \"in much better shape\" than he was at the start of this year.\n\n\"It's been a slow process of getting my head together but the album's come out at a perfect time where I can feel well and happy enough to properly enjoy it.\"\n\nOther than planning to \"throw my phone down the toilet\" because he's getting so many messages, the singer says he's also following more serious advice to keep on track.\n\n\"I'm obviously talking to the label all the time but I have to listen to doctors too.\n\n\"There are so many ups and downs of putting yourself in this kind of environment... things like this can have such a scary effect so I'm taking it slowly.\n\n\"I didn't think I'd be saying this a few months ago but I feel really good.\"\n\nAlthough Ben's been able to get himself into a strong enough place to release the album, he's still not been able to shake off Kanye.\n\n\"It's the funniest thing in the world that we announced the album on Monday... it was the exact same time Kanye said when his album would drop.\n\n\"So many of my delusions were about him and now he's stealing my number one!\"\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available here\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Ben Gregory, the frontman of acclaimed indie band Blaenavon, speaks about his mental health issues.", "authors": ["Jimmy Blake", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7DA5/production/_109356123_4556c4a9-08d1-4ae4-bf5e-40459bcc42f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
