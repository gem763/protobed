In an Instagram post, Swift said that UMG had agreed to distribute any proceeds from future sales of its shares in Spotify to artists, on a non-recoupable basis.\n\nHere's the weird thing: I can't find any information on UMG's current shareholding in Spotify. We know it was a holder for years, but it doesn't turn up in the list of hundreds of active shareholders in either S&P Capital IQ or FactSet. Nor was UMG mentioned in Spotify's IPO docs, outside of some licensing agreements.", "description": "The label agreed to distribute any proceeds from future sales of its shares in Spotify to artists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/kjhIZvetm-8sqH_5J9jE0huIc9s=/0x14:3986x2256/1920x1080/2018/11/20/1542724860524.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-20"}
