So why the delay if this is a serious attempt to address funding?\u201d\n\nIn July, hundreds of children and parents marched on Westminster to stop a rising number of schools across the country having to close early on Fridays amid funding cuts.\n\nThe demonstration was led by Labour MP Jess Phillips, whose son is at one of the schools in Birmingham that has been forced to adopt a four-and-a-half-day week amid tight budgets.\n\nMs Phillips told The Independent: \u201cThe reality is that the undoing of the four-and-a-half-days a week overnight is not going to happen because schools in my constituency had to cut so many other things before they made that final decision.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Parents understand why this is the case.\n\n\u201cAnd schools know that the government\u2019s pledges will not come into effect until April, meaning a further six months of an appalling status quo that will be only slightly alleviated.\u201d\n\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cToday\u2019s action by parents shows that they are not fooled by the government\u2019s claims about school and college funding.\n\n\u201cBudgets are still at breaking point. All the analysis of the government\u2019s figures shows that they just about restore the cuts of recent years \u2013 nothing more.\u201d\n\nJulie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, added: \u201cThe funding crisis is not over and parents are absolutely right to highlight the very serious impact that this situation is having on our schools.\n\n\u201cThe additional funding recently announced by the government is a step in the right direction but none of this money kicks in until next year and it is a long way short of what is needed.\n\n\u201cEven when it begins to find its way into schools many will still have to make budget savings because they will receive only inflationary uplifts and school costs are rising above inflation.\u201d\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cThis government has announced the biggest funding boost for schools in a decade which will give every school more money for every child. This means that every school in the country can see per pupil funding rise in line with inflation next year. To suggest otherwise is simply misleading.\n\n\u201cAll secondary schools will receive a minimum of \u00a35,000 per pupil next year, while all primary schools will get a minimum of \u00a34,000 from 2021-22 \u2013 with the biggest increases going to the schools that need it most.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing a total of \u00a314 billion more in schools over the next three years to give schools, teachers and parents the certainty to plan, improve standards and ensure all children get the top quality education they deserve.\u201d", "description": "Parents at hundreds of schools across the country are set to take part in a demonstration condemning the government\u2019s education cash boost as being \u201ctoo little too late\u201d. Families of children at nearly 350 schools in England are staging a day of action to demand an urgent increase in funding to reverse the negative effects that years of cuts have had on schools.
