It's interesting -- it's not something you see every day,\" said Eyad Tamish, 39.\n\nThe city's ancient monuments, some dating back to Crusader times, are used as stages and backdrops for the performances\n\nThe resident of the city -- known in Hebrew as Akko and Arabic as Akka -- came to \"admire the show\" with his young son Ibrahim, perched on his shoulders, and his wife Hana.\n\nSome 60 Israeli and foreign troupes -- from Italy, China, India and the United States -- presented their creations over four days on stage and in the alleys of the ancient city.\n\nArchaeological sites such as the Hospitaller Fortress dating back to the Crusader times served as an atypical setting for colourful performances.\n\nBorn in Tel Aviv in 1937, Kotler is an actor and director.\n\nIn 1967, he won best actor at the Cannes Film Festival for his role in the film \"Three Days and a Child\" by director Uri Zohar.\n\nA pillar of the Israeli arts scene, he directed the Haifa Theatre from 1970 to 1978 and the prestigious Israel Festival from 1985 to 1990.\n\nIsraeli artist Oded Kotler, the founder of the Akko Fringe Theatre Festival, has often been targeted by critics for his positions on Israel's political scene\n\nHe often evokes in his work the country's political situation, including the conflict with the Palestinians.\n\nSuch reflections have made him at times a target of critics on the right who see him as a condescending left-wing artist.\n\nIn 2015, he came under fire after seeming to compare those who vote for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party to a \"herd of cattle chewing straw and munching on cud.\"\n\n- 'Country being stupid' -\n\nAlthough he founded the festival, Kotler was presenting his own piece for the first time this year because \"he has things to say.\"\n\n\"The Curse\" is based on three ancient Greek tragedies: Aeschylus's \"Agamemnon\", Sophocles's \"Electra\" and Euripides's \"Iphigenia in Aulis.\"\n\nMore than 120,000 people were expected to attend this year's four-day festival\n\nWhile focusing on ancient Greece, it has relevance for today, he said.\n\n\"This is the story of a country that is doing something stupid, in this case embarking on the Trojan War, because it is what the king has decided, considering that the country belongs to him,\" said Kotler.\n\nIt is a thinly veiled allusion to Israel's current government and right-wing politicians.\n\n\"We almost never speak of the (Palestinian) territories, reconciliation and peace anymore,\" he said, with regret.", "description": "Oded Kotler made his way discretely through the crowd taking in the acrobats and clowns performing at a festival in Acre, an ancient city along the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/wire-19834920-1571313172-438_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
