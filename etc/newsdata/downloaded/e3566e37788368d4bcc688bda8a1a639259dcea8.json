Wyden: People like Mark Zuckerberg should be punished for their lies", "language": "en", "text": "Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has a message for Silicon Valley: mind your own business.\n\nOn Thursday, the Oregon Democrat introduced a data privacy bill which would force tech companies to do just that, and he\u2019s threatening to put executives behind bars if they don\u2019t comply.\n\n\u201cI don't think anything will change unless there are personal consequences when someone like Mark Zuckerberg lies and lies repeatedly to the public with respect to their privacy policies,\u201d Wyden tells Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move.\n\nThe Senator has been an outspoken critic of Facebook in the past, calling on the social network to change its policy on political advertising back in August of this year. Now, he says, Americans deserve to know how companies like Facebook are using their personal information.\n\n\u201cI think my bill goes to the heart of the key issues. One is people ought to be in a position to control what happens to their data. Second, we need more transparency in terms of how these companies work,\u201d he says.\n\nThe bill, dubbed the Mind Your Own Business Act, promises to create strong protections for Americans\u2019 personal data and gives the FTC additional power to enforce tough penalties, even jail time, for those who break the law.\n\nMy bill will protect consumers by:\n\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0fEstablishing minimum cybersecurity standards\n\n\u2714\ufe0fCreating stiff penalties for companies that misuse or abuse your data (including jail time for execs)\n\n\u2714\ufe0fGiving federal regulators the tools they need to go after bad actors abusing your data \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 17, 2019\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company\u2019s position on \u201cfree expression\u201d in a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday.\n\n\u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world \u2014 it\u2019s a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cI understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralized power, but I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people's hand.\u201d\n\nFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg addresses the audience on \"the challenges of protecting free speech while combating hate speech online, fighting misinformation, and political data privacy and security,\" October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso More\n\nThis all comes as Facebook increasingly finds itself at the center of the national debate, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle condemning the company\u2019s massive influence on government and politics. But Zuckerberg says this line of thinking could be \u201cdangerous for democracy over the long term.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, we're seeing people try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes that they see as unacceptable. Some hold the view that since the stakes are so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n-\n\nNick Rose is a producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Oregon Senator Rob Wyden introduces a new data privacy bill,known as the Mind Your Own Business Act.", "authors": ["Nick Rose"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3IZ.2.qHOuIL91zFXn12HQ--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/51b69330-83c0-11e9-bf9d-77a93754cb36", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
