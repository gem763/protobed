It tracks vehicles that have been sold and physically delivered to customers. The number is a barometer for how the company is performing ahead of releasing its quarterly earnings.", "description": "Musk set expectations high again this quarter, telling employees in a recent email that the company \"has a shot\" at delivering 100,000 cars, which would set a new record.", "authors": ["Michael Wayland Lora Kolodny", "Michael Wayland", "Lora Kolodny"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105768194-1551392963710gettyimages-1124905488.jpeg?v=1562002758"}
