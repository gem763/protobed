Instead, the campaigns for Travalyst will be overseen by Chief Executive Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan of Sunshine Sachs.\n\n\u201cAny cost of this work is being met privately,\u201d Holt added.\n\nTravalyst, which made its debut Tuesday in Amsterdam via Prince Harry, is a sustainable tourism organization that is partnered with Visa, Booking.com, Skyscanner, TripAdvisor and Ctrip. The international travel operation comes hot off the tails of last month\u2019s \u201cflight controversy,\u201d which involved the young royals and their usage of private jets in Nice, France.\n\n\"As tourism inevitably grows, it is critically important to accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices worldwide; and to balance this growth with the needs of the environment and the local population,\" Harry said in a statement on the Travalyst website. \"Bringing companies, consumers and communities together is our best chance to protect destinations and ecosystems for the future generation.\"\n\nAside from being vocal advocates about the danger of climate change, the prince and the duchess are rumored to looking for a home in Malibu, California, according to the Daily Mail \u2014 which doesn\u2019t make the hiring of Sunshine Sachs look too unusual.\n\nMoreover, Sunshine Sachs has represented Markle in the past when she was an actress on the TV drama \u201cSuits,\u201d according to The Sun\u2019s report.\n\nIt also said the U.S.-based PR firm has \u201cbeen guiding her through recent high-profile incidents, including a guest edit of [British] Vogue magazine,\u201d where she interviewed former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nOther famous clients the report said Sunshine Sachs represents include Ben Affleck, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, Snoop Dogg and Natalie Portman. Additionally, The Sun claimed Sunshine Sachs handled PR for the late pop star Michael Jackson and Harvey Weinstein in 2015, and, more recently, \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett in his recent hate crime controversy.\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, Sunshine Sachs used Wikipedia scrubbing tactics to remove undesirable details for its clients Naomi Campbell, Mia Farrow and Sarah Brightman.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are breaking away with their own travel initiative, and that includes a new PR team.", "authors": ["Cortney Moore"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/12/0/0/Prince20Harry20and20Meghan20Markle20RTR20FBN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
