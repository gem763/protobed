According to Dayna Isom Johnson, Etsy\u2019s in-house trend expert, the site has seen a 30% uptick in searches for \u201ccowboy hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoppers are channeling their inner cowgirls (and boys) with sophisticated fringe, rancher hats, and embellished denim,\u201d she wrote in a post on Etsy. \u201cI also predict a spike in cowboy boots moseying around town as the temperature starts to drop.\u201d\n\nAnthropologie (Pictured: Various hats at Anthropologie)\n\nLove it or hate it, the urban cowboy trend looks like it\u2019s here for the long haul. Even Everlane \u2014 a fashion brand known for its minimalist, capsule wardrobe-inspired pieces \u2014 just released \u201cThe Western Boot.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to giddy up into the cowgirl trend just yet, there\u2019s another huge trend for fall 2019: snake print. Searches for \u201csnake print\u201d on Pinterest are up almost 650% over six months on the site. That\u2019s a lot of folks trying to slither into this trend, whether with snake-print boots, a snake-print bag or even snake-print trousers.\n\nEven more surprising is the jewelry trend that Etsy\u2019s Johnson predicts we will see in earlobes everywhere. Pearl hoops brings the delicate look of pearl earrings to modern minimalists. Searches for \u201cpearl hoops\u201d on Etsy have increased more than 220% in the last three months, so expect to see more of see this dainty look in the cooler months.\n\nIf you want to know more about what to wear this fall and winter, take a look below through our predictions for the season\u2019s top looks, from shoe trends and prints and patterns to wear.\n\nIf you like what you see, sign up for HuffPost\u2019s sales and deals newsletter where we\u2019ll bring you more editor-sourced products and reviews.
