In these online communities, writers of all ages and skill levels\u2014from adolescents still refining their grammar to professional adult authors such as Jemisin\u2014are learning and teaching others how to write, and write well.\n\nRead: The fan-fiction friendship that fueled a romance novel empire\n\nA fan-fiction site is a uniquely energetic learning environment. Unlike in the classroom, where a writing prompt is as likely to be met with groans as with enthusiasm, writers on fan-fiction websites are thrilled to be there, excited to write, and passionate about the material\u2014because it\u2019s based on a book, TV show, movie, video game, or something else they already love. \u201cIt\u2019s really clear that if you have a genuine interest and a personal identification with the topic that you\u2019re learning about, your learning is going to be more engaging and, as a result, more successful,\u201d says Katie Davis, a professor at the University of Washington\u2019s Information School and a co-founder of its Digital Youth Lab.\n\nDavis, along with her University of Washington colleague Cecilia Aragon, recently spent nine months studying a couple of fan-fiction websites, focusing mostly on young authors writing on fanfiction.net. (Older, more experienced fan-fiction authors tend to prefer the website Archive of Our Own.) They published their observations in a new book called Writers in the Secret Garden, and described their theory that people on these websites are actually teaching one another to write through a kind of sprawling, communal learning that Aragon and Davis call \u201cdistributed mentorship.\u201d\n\nThough writers may develop traditional two-person mentor/mentee relationships on fan-fiction websites, the researchers posit that much more often, people are being diffusely mentored by the entire community. An author frequently receives many small pieces of feedback in the form of reviews (sometimes thousands on one story) that are in conversation with one another and that \u201care cumulatively much greater than the sum of their parts,\u201d Aragon told me.\n\nOne example from their book is how commenters responded to a writer\u2019s question about portraying Princess Luna, a villain from the show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. One person wrote: \u201cFrom the limited amount of stories that I have read, Luna is usually portrayed as a gamer or somewhat out of touch with modern culture.\u201d Then another offered their take on that advice: \u201cWhile I\u2019m picky about the kind of technology that I would introduce into a story, Luna being behind the times is right on the money.\u201d\n\nThese communities also \u201callow for a lot of different forms of expertise,\u201d says Rebecca Black, an informatics professor at the University of California at Irvine who has studied fan fiction (but who wasn\u2019t involved in Davis and Aragon\u2019s project). \u201cEven if you aren\u2019t the best writer, you might know everything there is to know about a certain character in the series.\u201d People can switch between the roles of teacher and student, depending on their strengths and weaknesses.", "description": "Everyone leaves feedback and reviews for one another, leading to a sprawling, communal learning environment.", "authors": ["Julie Beck"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_964173126/facebook.jpg?1569941256", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
