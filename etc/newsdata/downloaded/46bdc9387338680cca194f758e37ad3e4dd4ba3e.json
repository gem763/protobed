As humbly as I can put it, he's using me to show off,' West began in the special Airpool Karaoke segment, which took to the skies in a private jet rather than the usual car.\n\n'Last year I made a $115million and still ended up $35million in debt,' he explained. 'This year I looked up and I just got $68million returned to me on on my tax.'\n\nAppearing on Airpool Karaoke for The Late Late Show with James Corden, Kanye West said: 'Last year I made $115million and still ended up $35million in debt. This year I looked up and I just got $68 million returned to me on on my tax'\n\nWest added: 'People need to hear someone - who has been put into debt by the system - talk about these kind of numbers now that they're serviced to Christ'\n\nWith his Sunday Service choir behind him, West shared that while others might not be so quick to disclose details of the tax returns, he is willing to do so if it means helping spread the word and inspiring others to be saved.\n\n'And people say don't talk about these numbers,' he continued. 'No, people need to hear someone - who has been put into debt by the system - talk about these kind of numbers now that they're serviced to Christ.'\n\nWest has been holding his Sunday Service worship services since the beginning of the year.\n\nHe said on the program that with the success of his fashion business too, it's proof having faith works wonders.\n\n'God is showing off! Yeezy [his brand] is worth $3billion dollars, number one searched brand in the world, he's showing out,' West exclaimed, adding: 'Kanye West works for God!'\n\nAppearing with his Sunday Service choir, he said God is 'showing out' with his Yeezy brand being worth $3billion dollars and the no.1 searched brand globally\n\nWest told Corden about God: 'As humbly as I can put it, he's using me to show off'\n\nIt's not only religion that West hopes he can help push fans toward, elsewhere in the chat he claimed that marriage was 'uncool' until he tied the knot with Kim Kardashian in May 2014.\n\nThe rapper spoke candidly about his relationship with the 39-year-old,who he has been married to for five years. But he claimed marriage years are longer than human years.\n\nHe went on to compare 'marriage years' to 'dog years,' with one dog year equivalent to seven human years, though every 'marriage year' is equal to 100 human years.\n\nThe rapper added that it feels like he's been married to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star for '500 years.'\n\nKanye continued: 'People thought it would be uncool to be married, and then I got married and people thought \"oh that looks cool\".'\n\nAs James quipped: 'No one ever thought it would be uncool to marry Kim Kardashian. Everybody thought it would be cool to marry Kim', Kanye was quick to jump in: 'Well not Kris Humphries!'\n\nHe continued: 'It's more than cool, more than cool as hell or something, It's heavenly, it's great, it's magnificent.'\n\nThe rapper dropped his ninth studio album Jesus Is King last week and recently confirmed his born-again Christianity (pictured with his choir at Coachella in April)\n\nMarried life: Kanye also claimed that it feels as though he's been married for '500 years' and insisted that marriage was 'uncool' until he tied the knot\n\nTrendsetter: Kanye continued: 'People thought it would be uncool to be married, and then I got married and people thought \"oh that looks cool\"'. He joked, all except Kris Humphries\n\nChat then turned to their family life, with Kanye discussing how he spends his evenings with Kim and their children North, six, Saint, three, and Chicago, 22 months and Psalm, five months.\n\nThe Yeezus hitmaker explained: 'I don't like going out at nighttime, I like being at home with my family as much as possible.\n\n'We eat dinner and we play with the kids and we'll put the kids to bed and then we'll go to bed and my wife watches Dateline and I read the Bible.'\n\nJames, who shares three children with his wife Julia Carey, then asked Kanye if he would recommend they try for a fourth.\n\nKanye was quick to encourage the comedian, stating: 'The richest thing you can have is as many children as possible.'\n\nAs James asked 'you would roll for a fifth?', Kanye was quick to respond 'for a seventh!' explaining that he and Kim were in agreement that having seven children would be the ideal.\n\nJames had been trying to get West on Carpool Karaoke only to have Kanye cancel on him twice, but the third time was the charm, it seems.\n\nAside from the Carpool Karaoke session taking place on a plane instead of a car, Kanye's appearance marked another first, with the choir performing the first live performance in the sketch's history.\n\nKanye also talked how his friends and family, while meaning well, didn't know how to get through to him.\n\n'People in my family were praying for me, but they couldn't call me and scream at me. I'm a grown man,' Kanye said.\n\n'But it was God that came and put this thing on my heart and asked if I was ready to be in service to him,' Kanye said, adding, 'I have no regret and no shame.'\n\nKanye also performed his hit song Jesus Walks from his 2004 album College Dropout, but he made some subtle changes to the lyrics.", "description": "Kanye West\u00a0has revealed he got a $68million tax return this year but the rapper believes he might not have been so fortunate if he hadn't turned to Christ recently.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/17/20336606-0-image-a-7_1572369956931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
