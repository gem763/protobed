Some delivered as expected. Some surprised. There were no rate hikes, a few cut rates and a few did nothing. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) took out additional \u201cinsurance\u201d against a slowdown in the economy, while the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) reluctantly lowered its new lending rate although it may have been too small to have a major impact on the economy.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut interest rates for the second time this year following the Fed\u2019s decision.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve\n\nThe Fed cut its benchmark interest rate 25-basis points as widely expected for the second time since July, as concerns grow about a potential global economic slowdown. Policymakers also left the door open for another rate cut this year if the economy weakens further although the market isn\u2019t sure if it will come in October or December. Traders want to see two more cuts this year.\n\n\u201cWe took this step to keep the economy strong,\u201d said Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nPolicymakers have been sharply divided over whether to hold or continue to gradually reduce rates as the US economy presents a mixed picture. Not all Federal Open Market Committee members were on board for the move however. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Ester George voiced concerns that the U.S. economy isn\u2019t in need of an extra boost from rate cuts. However, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard favored a deeper, 50-basis point cut.\n\nPeople\u2019s Bank of China\n\nThe PBOC cut its new one-year benchmark lending rate for the second month in a row on Friday. The move was designed to gain control of borrowing costs and support the economy as the U.S.-China trade dispute drags on.\n\nThe Loan Prime Rate (LPR) was cut 5 basis points to 4.2%, the second time it has been trimmed since it was revamped in August, and days after the central bank\u2019s latest reduction in banks\u2019 reserve requirements took effect.\n\nThe move was far less than the rate cuts by the Fed last week and the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) the week before, suggesting Chinese officials remain reluctant to join the other major central banks in implementing aggressive stimulus measures due to worries over mounting debt.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate 25-basis points as widely expected for the second time since July, as concerns grow about a potential global economic slowdown.
