There are no plans at present to change this.'", "description": "Savers who hold money with both Charter Savings and One Savings, under the Kent Reliance brand, will retain the maximum cash protection limits for both  - up to a total of \u00a3170,000.", "authors": ["Sarah Davidson For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
