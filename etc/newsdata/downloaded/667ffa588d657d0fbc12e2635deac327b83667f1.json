REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - There is still a big risk of Britain crashing out of the European Union without reaching a deal with the bloc, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult at this point to see how (British Prime Minister) Boris Johnson manages to strike a deal with the European Union that will satisfy the European Union and also be capable of a majority in the House of Commons,\u201d Sturgeon said on a trip to Berlin to build ties with the German government.\n\n\u201c(This) is why a no deal Brexit cannot be ruled out and remains a big significant risk,\u201d she added.\n\nSturgeon said her Scottish National Party (SNP) would do everything it could to avert Brexit \u201cand certainly avert a no deal Brexit, and we hope Scotland will remain part of the European Union for many years to come\u201d.\n\nBut she added that an extension was preferable to a no-deal exit. She said a general election in Britain in the coming months was inevitable or as close to inevitable as possible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the SNP will be in a formal coalition with other parties after an election, but we will seek to work collaboratively with other parties firstly to try to make sure the Conservatives don\u2019t return to government and also to seek a reversal of the Brexit decision so that the UK can remain in the EU,\u201d she added.", "description": "There is still a big risk of Britain crashing out of the European Union without reaching a deal with the bloc, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431157969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0KY", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
