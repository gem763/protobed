It's a symbol of our country,\" he told FOX5. \"People have bled and died for that.\"\n\nOKLAHOMA BOY, 3, WOWS POLICE WITH HIS UNIFORM\n\nBuratczuk had first spotted the flag in the northbound lanes but kept driving past. He then decided to circle back around to retrieve it.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'How could someone let this fall off their car?'\" he told FOX5.\n\nVideo released by police shows the officer pulled over to the left side of the roadway and getting out to retrieve the flag as cars zip past.\n\nDELTA FLIES 120 GIRLS TO NASA WITH ALL-WOMEN CREW TO CELEBRATE GIRLS IN AVIATION DAY\n\nThe highway patrol said that Buratczuk collected the flag and immediately brought it to a local American Legion Lodge.
