At the same time, may it strengthen your spirit of fraternity with one another,\u201d the greeting runs.\n\nWe live at a time when efforts are being made toward \u201cinterreligious and intercultural dialogue, cooperation and fraternal solidarity,\u201d the message notes.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there is apathy, indifference and even hatred among some religious people towards others,\u201d it states. \u201cThis is often caused by a failure to recognize the \u2018other\u2019 as a brother or sister. Such an attitude can arise from misguided, ungenerous or unsympathetic sentiments, which upset and unsettle the very fabric of harmonious coexistence in society.\u201d\n\nIn point of fact, crimes against Christians in India have shot up this year, increasing by 57 percent during the first two months of 2019 over the same period in 2018.\n\nDuring January and February, 77 incidents of \u201chate and targeted violence against Christians\u201d were documented in the majority Hindu nation, as compared with the 49 cases recorded during the same period last year, according to the Religious Liberty Commission of the Evangelical Fellowship of India (EFI).\n\nIn its message Monday, the Pontifical Council declared that \u201cevery individual, particularly Christians and Hindus,\u201d are called to be \u201cbuilders of fraternity and peaceful coexistence wherever they are,\u201d while suggesting that all religions inspire people to love one another.\n\nReligion \u201cfundamentally inspires us to see in the other a brother or sister to be supported and loved,\u201d the text states, and teaches us \u201cto respect the inviolable dignity and the inalienable rights of others without any unwarranted bias towards their creed or culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, living in a spirit of fraternity and fellowship through constant dialogue should be a natural corollary of being a religious person, Hindu or Christian,\u201d it reads.\n\nPrior to being elected Pope Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger wrote extensively on interreligious dialogue, and in particular about the dangers inherent in seeing all religions as fundamentally equal and in looking to eastern religions to complement or complete Christianity.\n\nIn his 2003 work Truth and Tolerance: Christian Belief and World Religions, Ratzinger said that the \u201ca-religious and pragmatic relativism of Europe and America can borrow a kind of consecration from India, which seems to give its renunciation of dogma the dignity of a heightened reverence for the mystery of God and of man.\u201d\n\n\u201cConversely, the way that European and American thinking has turned back to India\u2019s philosophical and theological vision has the effect of further strengthening that relativizing of all religious figures which is part of India\u2019s heritage,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cThus it now actually seems imperative in India, even for Christian theology, to extract from its particularity the figure of Christ, regarded as Western, and to set it beside Indian redemption myths as if it were of similar status: the historical Jesus, so people now think, is actually no more uniquely the Logos than any other savior figures from history are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that here, in the context of the encounter between cultures, relativism seems appropriate as the true philosophy of humanity gives it (as we have already suggested) such an appreciable impact, both in East and West, that it hardly seems possible to offer further resistance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe real problem, Ratzinger noted, was that nowadays religions \u201care seen as being all of the same kind. But that is by no means the case. There are in fact sick and degenerate forms of religion, which do not edify people but alienate them.\u201d\n\nIn Hinduism \u201cthere are some marvelous elements \u2014 but there are also negative aspects: involvement with the caste system; suttee [self immolation] for widows, which developed from beginnings that were merely symbolic; offshoots of the cult of the goddess Sakti \u2014 all these might be mentioned, to give just a little idea,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSo in the Indian religious cosmos, \u201cthere are very different forms: very high and pure ones that are marked by the idea of love, but also wholly gruesome ones that include ritual murder,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue sent greetings to Hindus around the world, wishing them a fruitful feast of Deepavali.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
