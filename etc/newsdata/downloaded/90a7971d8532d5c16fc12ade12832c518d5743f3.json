Its deepest inroads are in highly troubled countries, such as the Central African Republic, or pariah states such as Sudan and Zimbabwe that are often under UN sanctions.\n\nBetween the lines: During the 2000s, the Kremlin envisioned Africa as part of a \u201cmultipolar world\u201d that would not be led by Washington.\n\nAfrica\u2019s heavy representation in the UN \u2014 it accounts for more than 25% of countries in the UN General Assembly \u2014 made it an important target.\n\nSince 2014, nimble Russian diplomacy and old-fashioned vote-buying has strengthened African support for Moscow\u2019s stances on Crimea, Syria and Libya.\n\nYes, but: Russia has little economic penetration on the continent.\n\nIn 2017, trade between Russia and sub-Saharan Africa was $3 billion, well behind China's $56 billion and the U.S.' $27 billion. The most significant mineral and energy opportunities it's pursuing have already been examined or discarded by other players.\n\nLimited resources and risk appetite have left Russia falling back on tools like sending Kremlin-connected mercenaries to conflict zones or offering consulting services to autocratic regimes on election manipulation.\n\nWhat to watch: No ground-breaking trade, investment or security announcements came out of the summit, suggesting the gathering was more symbolic than substantive. But if Moscow expands its Africa policy after the summit and under the West's inattentive watch, it could be a far greater worry for the West.\n\nPaul Stronski is a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Russia and Eurasia Program.", "description": "Russia's ties to the continent are a far cry from those of the U.S. and China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/uuwZ7jeVlXeTCe_tf4HDQ4RitFc=/0x137:5184x3053/1920x1080/2019/10/24/1571948667464.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
