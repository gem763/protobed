One of my fellow passengers, Jim from Montana, claimed to have sailed every navigable river in the United States. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve seen America from the river, you haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d was Jim\u2019s opinion, and once you\u2019ve experienced the Mississippi for yourself, you\u2019ll probably feel the same.\n\nFrom its source up in Minnesota it flows south for 2,300 miles (3,700km) to the Gulf of Mexico, touching 10 states and acting as a drainage basin for 41 per cent of the land mass of the contiguous US. The stats keep on rolling \u2013 it is the fourth-longest river in the world after the Nile, Amazon and Yangtze \u2013 but its significance lies not merely in such figures. The Mississippi is great because so much of America\u2019s history and culture has been lapped by its muddy waters.", "description": "Nigel Richardson soaks up the spirit of America on a journey along the mighty Mississippi", "authors": ["Nigel", "Travel Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/May/missiippi-new-orleans-iStock-491921404-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
