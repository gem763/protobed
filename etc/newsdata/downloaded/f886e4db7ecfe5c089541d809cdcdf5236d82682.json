I was a bit sad, but I was alright mentally for the rest of that afternoon.\u201d\n\nSmith is expected to return to action in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford next week after missing Australia\u2019s remarkable defeat at Headingley.\n\nDespite suggestions that Archer\u2019s blow may have been a turning point in the series and detrimental to Smith\u2019s supreme form, the talismanic number four has shrugged off claims that he will adjust his approach after being struck.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not really going to change anything. There\u2019s been a bit of talk that he\u2019s got the wood over me but he hasn\u2019t got me out,\u201d said Smith of Archer.\n\n\u201cHe hit me on the head on a wicket that was a bit up and down at Lord\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAll the other bowlers have had more success against me, I dare say. I\u2019ve faced them a bit more but they\u2019ve all got me out a lot more, so, yeah, pretty comfortable about that.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s incident has brought the use of stem neck guards back into the spotlight. It is not currently mandatory to use them, and some batsmen, including Smith, find them restrictive and un-natural.\n\nGoverning body Cricket Australia will look to make the wearing of neck guards compulsory within a year to further protect batsmen.\n\nAnd though Smith\u2019s heart rate increased by \u201c30 or 40\u201d beats per minute when wearing the guards, the batsman says he will have to get used to them.\n\n\u201cI just feel claustrophobic. I compare it to being stuck in an MRI scan machine so it was different,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some point they\u2019re probably going to become mandatory so I am going to have to get used to them.\u201d", "description": "Steve Smith has said being hit by a Jofra Archer short ball brought back sad memories of the death of Phillip Hughes. Hughes was struck in a similar area to Smith during a 2014 Sheffield Shield match in Sydney, and did not regain consciousness before passing away in hospital two days after being hit.", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/18/12/Smith-leaves-the-field-after-being-hit-by-Archer.jpg"}
