That matched July's annual increase as the slowest in seven years. Wages have been increasing more quickly than home prices since February, reversing a yearslong trend.\n\nSlower price gains combined with low mortgage rates have helped the housing market revive this year after a slump in 2018. Steady hiring and an unemployment rate at a 50-year have also forced companies to offer higher pay, making it easier for more people to afford house payments. And the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 3.75% last week, down sharply from 4.86% a year earlier.\n\nSales of existing homes have increased 3.9% in the past year, while sales of new homes have soared 15.5% compared with a year earlier.\n\nAs many once-hot Western markets cool off, cities in the Southeast are starting to see the nation's fastest price gains. Phoenix reported the biggest increase, with prices rising 6.3% from a year ago. But Charlotte saw the next highest gain, at 4.5%, followed by Tampa at 4.3% and Atlanta with 4%.\n\nHome prices in Seattle barely rose, increasing just 0.7% from a year ago, while they slipped 0.1% in San Francisco.\n\nThe supply of available homes remains low, with builders complaining about a lack of available land and shortage of construction workers.\n\nThose trends have pushed up the cost of lower-priced homes more quickly than more expensive ones in many cities. In Tampa, for example, homes priced below $195,000 have seen prices rise by nearly double digits in the past year, while the highest-priced homes, above $284,000, have seen price gains at less than half that pace, according to the Case-Shiller data.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
