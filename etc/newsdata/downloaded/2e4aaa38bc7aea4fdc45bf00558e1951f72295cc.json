At the time, the scan revealed the dog was expecting maybe five or six puppies. Barrett said she expected Beau to deliver eight at most.\n\nBACTERIAL DISEASE SICKENING DOGS IN COLORADO CAN SPREAD TO HUMANS, VET SAYS\n\nBut when Beau went into labor, it was quickly made clear there were many more than first anticipated.\n\n\u201cThe vet told us it would take about an hour for each puppy to be born. We thought there could be up to eight, so roughly calculated [an] eight-hour labor. But after seven were born in just 40 minutes, we were all absolutely gobsmacked. They were just flying out,\u201d she told SWNS, a British news agency.\n\nThe dog\u2019s labor and delivery was going well until one of the puppies, a female, became lodged in her birth canal.\n\n\u201cShe was there for 40 minutes. By the time we got her out she wasn\u2019t breathing or moving,\u201d she said. Barrett was able to save the young dog, however. Named Hope, the pup is now one of the biggest in the litter.\n\n\u201cBeau only has 10 teets for 13 puppies, which left three who were just too weak to force their way on. That meant I\u2019d get up in the middle of the night to hand-feed them. They\u2019d probably have died otherwise,\u201d she added.\n\nSeven weeks later, all the puppies are doing well. Barrett is keeping two of them \u2013 Hope and a male named Bear \u2013 while the rest will be sold for roughly $1,223 each.\n\nVETERINARIAN STUDENTS STRIP DOWN FOR RACY CALENDAR SHOOT IN NAME OF MENTAL HEALTH\n\n\u201cBeau is our baby, so for her to have babies is so special,\u201d she added.\n\nA black Lab in Scotland delivered 15 puppies in 2014, which reportedly marked the biggest litter ever recorded for the breed.
