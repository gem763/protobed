Among them are the need for a \"mental coach\" while competing in ATP events and the use of a behavioral management expert during the off season.\n\nKyrgios has five days to launch an appeal but the Australian has said on social media he will accept the probation.", "description": "Controversial tennis star Nick Kyrgios could face a 16-week suspension from ATP events and a $25,000 fine after his on court outburst at the Cincinnati Masters in August.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926114444-kyrgios-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
