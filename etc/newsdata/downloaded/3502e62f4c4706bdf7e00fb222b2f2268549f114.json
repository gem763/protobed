The digital card game, available on PC, smooths down the coarser aspects of paper Magic games, making for an easy landing pad for newbies and a great user experience for Magic veterans.\n\nReleased in open beta last September, Magic Arena is the second video game adaptation to recreate the 26-year-old paper-card game. The first was 2002\u2019s Magic: The Gathering Online, which, to gamers outside its dedicated fanbase or spoiled by Hearthstone\u2019s delightful user experience, may now look clunky and unfriendly. Magic Arena is slated for a full release sometime this year, but right now, it\u2019s a fully playable game that\u2019s widely been well-received by newbies, lapsed fans, and hardcore players alike.\n\nThis piece was first published on May 15, 2019. We\u2019re bumping it today for the game\u2019s official launch.\n\nJust like its paper-card predecessor, Magic Arena is \u2014 on its most basic level \u2014 a strategy game that has two players pit their Magic decks against each other. One loses when their health is depleted from 20 to 0 or when they attempt to draw a card after the entire deck has been played or milled. Card types include creatures, which can deal or block damage; sorceries, which cast spells; enchantments, which cast long-term spells; and more. To \u201ccast\u201d a card, players must have the requisite amount and colour of mana, Magic\u2019s name for resources.\n\nMagic: The Gathering Arena\n\nLast week, three researchers published a paper arguing that Magic is so complex that it could stump a computer. It is; at its highest levels, it\u2019s a game of poker-like odds crunching, cold-reading opponents, research, and big-variable calculations. Deck construction relies on balancing powerful cards against the need for coherent, interlocking mechanics.\n\nLuck plays its part, too. There\u2019s a reason that hobby shops are still packed with players excitedly peeling apart packs at new Magic sets\u2019 prerelease tournaments. The game has one of the highest skill ceilings out there with an enticingly low barrier to entry.\n\nMagic Arena is pushing that barrier to entry right into the ground with its clear emphasis on accessibility, riding on the heels of Hearthstone\u2019s success. I\u2019ve played Magic casually since college and, over the last two years, started regularly attending tournaments in hobby shops. Magic Arena\u2019s digital environment has been nurturing enough to help me start taking the game seriously.\n\nIt offers a thorough gameplay tutorial \u2014 perhaps too thorough \u2014 complete with five educational games against a computer. Seasoned and intermediate players will find these games tiresome and the voice acting a little cutesy; beginners and lapsed players will find them essential.\n\nMagic Arena streamlines tedious aspects of physical gameplay while lengthening the ones that inspire deeper strategy. For example, it helps to see opponents\u2019 card layouts and create decks using the same card more than once. A more subtle feature is seeing each stage of combat made distinct. Arena separates each phase, making it possible to fathom subtle openings for instant spells or creature casting that even intermediate players may not have otherwise capitalised on.\n\nAssembling decks is seamless, too, and people who were intimidated by paper cards now have less to fear. Magic Arena automatically sorts and organizes cards by colour, mana cost, card type, whatever, in a way that makes it easy for players to conceptualize potential strategies and combos.\n\nAlso in the category of user-friendliness, I love always being able to catch a game of Magic\u2019s booster draft (where players assemble decks by taking one card out of a pack before passing it to the next person) and sealed deck (where players create decks using the contents of several new packs). Magic Arena has been a gateway for me to participate in these games without competing at a hobby shop and\u2014I\u2019ll say it\u2014being the only woman in there. Typically, I played Magic with decks I\u2019d hastily assembled with friends or official pre-constructed decks.\n\nOften enough, that\u2019s fun, but if somebody shows up with their arsehole goblin deck or their \u201cmill all of my cards\u201d deck, I don\u2019t have a great time. Playing Limited\u2014the name for those modes\u2014whenever I want means constructing decks using the same card pool as my opponents and challenging myself to be as resourceful as possible. I prefer that to the Standard format\u2019s tendency toward opportunistic mean-spiritedness. (Being the best in Standard, where players build decks with whatever recent cards they have in their collection, can mean haemorrhaging money on packs and single cards.)\n\nDeck-building in Magic Arena (Image: Magic Arena)\n\nA lot of fans are calling for publisher Wizards of the Coast to add more formats to Magic Arena. Currently, the main modes are standard constructed, sealed deck, and booster draft, ranked or unranked. Wizards will, in time. For now, I\u2019m having a hard time tiring of the formats currently offered, especially since the current Magic set is so much fun. That said, it would be nice to pair up with a teammate for a two-versus-two game, and as it stands, Magic Arena does not currently have a friends list (players must \u201cdirect challenge\u201d each other at the same time).\n\nNothing will ever replace the experience of exchanging part-time job money for a foil Magic card under glass at the hobby shop. That\u2019s a sensory experience above all\u2014well, almost all. Getting free stuff is a close second. Magic Arena, which is playable for free, is generous with its resources (gold and gems), for the most part. Players can use these to buy packs and participate in drafts. A 750-gem bundle for $7 lets you participate in a ranked draft that comes with three packs.\n\nThat same bundle of gems can be exchanged for three packs (600 gems) or card sleeves (600 gems). Physical Magic packs go for about $6 each. It\u2019s not a bad deal, and Magic Arena offers players packs and cards just for logging in, playing, or winning, but the truth is that playing Magic Arena and spending no money means being either uncompetitive or very, very good.\n\nIs that an issue? Not for people who play a lot of Magic. Cards were the original loot boxes. Microtransactions come with the territory.\n\nMagic: The Gathering Arena BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE 'A Beginner's Guide to Getting Owned' TYPE OF GAME Trap-card activator LIKED Seamless user interface, well-articulated battle system, easy deck-building, relatively good value for cards DISLIKED Players can't change or disolve wildcards after redeeming, uninspired music and graphics, inability to draft with humans DEVELOPER Wizards of the Coast PLATFORM PC RELEASE DATE Released in open beta September 2018\u2014full release date unknown PLAYED 10 hours across Standard, Standard ranked, Sealed, Traditional Draft and Ranked Draft\n\nI invested $7 in Magic Arena\u2019s Welcome Bundle, which included five packs and had enough gems for a sealed deck with six packs. After winning several draft games, I earned enough gems to play in another draft without investing more money. When I didn\u2019t do as well, I had to buy in again. If you\u2019re somebody who immediately wants the best cards for the strongest decks, and you want to competitively play in the game\u2019s Standard mode, you\u2019re going to have to buy a lot of packs, but it\u2019s still cheaper than paper.\n\nThe issue, of course, is that players can\u2019t redeem paper cards they\u2019d collected over the last 26 years in the game. In fact, few past sets are available at all \u2014 mostly ones from 2017 on. Reached for comment, publisher Wizards of the Coast said, \u201cThere is currently no plan to add the ability to transfer cards from paper to Arena, however, some physical Planeswalker Decks from stores have a code to redeem for that same deck in Arena and pre-release \u2018Sealed\u2019 play sets have a code for redemption in Arena.\u201d\n\nOutside of the game\u2019s mechanics, Magic Arena has a lot of growing to do as it approaches its \u201cfull release.\u201d Arena deserves more background art and better, more listenable music\u2014both currently feel like afterthoughts. For a game that\u2019s historically so loving of aesthetics, Magic\u2019s new digital card game is a little sparse on the bells and whistles.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict what Magic Arena will mean for the paper card game\u2019s future. That said, it\u2019s easy to look around and see hype for the game snowballing alongside Arena\u2019s release and the launch of Magic\u2019s new esports league. For my part, Magic Arena\u2019s pitch has finally gotten me hooked on a game I\u2019ve been playing on and off for seven years.\n\nIts ease of play makes the average Magic game more of a ballet than a stop-and-start football match. As most of its clunkier aspects game melt away, the heart of a card game that has nearly three decades\u2019 worth of staying power shines through.", "description": "Magic: The Gathering Arena isn\u2019t the same as ripping open Magic packs with your childhood best friend on a sunny park bench, but it is the next best thing.
