She told her mother she thought the men were going to go after her.\n\nAnd they did.\n\n\u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d her younger sister, Jennifer Johnson, told The Daily Beast. \u201cMy mom went inside to get a few things after picking up Maryann and when she came back\u2014she was gone.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say a group of eight friends took the seventh-grader to a secluded house where she was bound, beaten, and gang-raped before she was drowned. At least one of the man also had sex with her after she died.\n\nNine months later, in July 1998, a driver spotted the teen\u2019s remains\u2014bound in a blanket and wrapped in a metal two chain and padlock\u2014floating on Lake Lillinonah, about 20 minutes from where she was last seen. It took four years, 80 interviews, and a $50,000 reward for police to arrest eight suspects\n\n\u201cThe whole town was relieved when they were finally arrested,\u201d Johnson said this week. \u201cWe just wanted justice for my sister.\u201d\n\n\u201c My mom went inside to get a few things after picking up Maryann and when she came back\u2014she was gone. \u201d \u2014 Jennifer Johnson, sister of murder victim Maryann Measles\n\nAmong the accused were three women who allegedly took part in the crime because they were furious Maryann reportedly slept with their boyfriends. One of them, Maggie Mae Bennett, cut a plea deal with police in March 2004, agreeing to testify against her friends in exchange for a 19-year prison sentence.\n\nBut Bennett, now 40, will not serve the full sentence. As The Hartford Courant first reported, she will be released on Oct. 10 with time off for good behavior.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sickening,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI am having chest pain, kidney pain, depression about all of this. It\u2019s literally making me physically sick to know she will be out soon.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she was 10 years old when she last saw her sister on Oct. 17, 1997. Maryann had just returned home from the police station, where she spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d giving her statement about sexual encounters with A.J. Walter, Jr., 19, and Keith Foster, 21.\n\n\u201c I was outside in the yard when she got dropped off by a deputy,\u201d Johnson recalled last week. \u201cShe changed and before she went back out again, she hugged me and said \u2018I love you baby sis.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMaryann had changed over the last few months before she disappeared, and we weren\u2019t as close as we had been, so I remember being shocked by the hug,\u201d she added.\n\nThat change, she said, began after Maryann turned 13 and started gabing out with a group in their late teens or early 20s.\n\nAccording to Bennett\u2019s 2006 testimony, Maryann began showing up to smoke marijuana with the group at a secluded spot in New Milford. At the time, Bennett said, the friends had all coupled off: Bennett was sleeping with Walter, Foster was dating Dorothy Hallas, and Jeffrey Boyette was seeing June Bates Seger. By early October, Walter and Foster had allegedly had sex with Maryann multiple times.\n\n\"I was upset because [Walter] was my boyfriend at the time,\" Bennett testified, according to Westport News.\n\nBennett said the group was enraged when they found out Maryann and her mother had gone to New Milford police several times to make a statutory rape complaint against Foster and Walter. She said they hatched a plan to get her to stay quiet.\n\nJohnson said her sister had been with the older friends for two days when she called her mother, Cindi, collect on Oct. 19 and asked her to pick her up.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know this at the time, but my mother apparently heard the group yelling nasty things at my sister in the background,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMy aunt stayed on the phone with Maryann while my mom went to go get her.\u201d\n\nLow on gas, Cindi Measles decided to stop at the grocery store and told Maryann to wait in the car \u201cbecause it would be fast,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson believes two men approached the car just as soon as her mother walked through the supermarket\u2019s automatic doors, took Maryann into their car, and drove her to their weed spot.\n\nHallas was allegedly the first person to start hitting Maryann, \u201ccalling her a liar, calling her a bitch, saying the guys never raped her,\u201d Bennett testified. Maryann, she said, was \u201ccrying\u201d and begging everyone to stop.\u201d\n\nFoster then ordered Bennett to open the black van, and Boyette, Walter, and their friend Deaneric Dupas pushed Maryann into the back. Bennett said she could see one of the boys raping her.\n\n\u201cShe was trying to break loose from when they were holding her,\u201d Bennett testified, adding that Boyette and Foster also took turns. Afterward, Bennett alleged, Walter and Dupas dragged Maryann down to the water, forced her to her knees and put head her underwater for five minutes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying to struggle, but they're both a lot bigger than her,\" Bennett testified. \u201cAt one point, when Dean picked her up, she wasn\u2019t coughing anymore. Keith yelled down and asked if she was dead yet.\u201d\n\nWhen Maryann started floating, the boys began to laugh, Bennett said. Walter then allegedly had sex with the teenager\u2019s corpse before the group wrapped her in a blanket, secured it with a tow chain and padlock, and pushed her into the river.\n\nFor months, the Measles family desperately searched for Maryann, posting hundreds of missing persons flyers throughout town. New Milford Police spent more than 700 hours in search parties, conducted over 80 interviews, and tracked about 60 leads, according to a police spokerson.\n\n\u201cMy mother sent me and my two little sisters to my aunt and uncle\u2019s house for a few months so they could focus on looking for Maryann full-time,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s literally making me physically sick to know she will be out soon. \u201d \u2014 Jennifer Johnson\n\nMeanwhile, the eight friends pretended like nothing happened, consoling the Measles family whenever they ran into them around town and making up stories about what happened to her.\n\n\u201cMy mother saw Maggie one time at Burger King,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe apologized for my mother\u2019s loss and said that if she ever needed someone to watch me and my sisters, she was available. Can you imagine?\u201d\n\nAlthough Maryann\u2019s body was found in 1998, it took police almost five years to arrest and charge Foster, Walter, Dupas, Boyette, Bennet, Seger and Hallas. Ronald Rajcok, who drove the group, was also arrested.\n\n\u201cOur family had gotten their hands on a police scanner, which in 2002, they were really hard to get,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd as the police were catching them, they were on the scanner yelling \u2018We fucking got them!\u2019 as my family and neighbors were all together cheering. It was like a block party.\u201d\n\nBennett was the first of the group to flip on her friends, pleading guilty a month later to first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, risk of injury to a minor, tampering with evidence and witness tampering.\n\nIn February 2004, Walter pleaded guilty to murder, reenacting the attack on video for two state detectives as part of his cooperation agreement, and was sentenced to 60 years in prison. Walter later admitted to having sex with Maryann\u2019s dead body.\n\nHallas, who also testified in court, pleaded guilty to felony murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, and risk of injury to a minor. In the same month, Boyette was sentenced to 50 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder.\n\nIn 2006, Superior Court Judge Robert C. Brunetti sentenced Bennett to at least 19 years in prison and Hallas to 25 years.\n\n\u201cI know I have done the unthinkable and I deserve to be punished, but I have also helped in some ways with the conviction of one of my co-defendants and helping the truth come out,\u201d Bennett wrote in a statement to Brunetti, which was read by her public defender in court. \u201cI'm begging for mercy, for the least amount of time allowed by my plea agreement.\u201d\n\nHallas was reportedly contrite during her sentencing, telling the judge that while was sorry, she could not \u201ctake any of it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn't kill her, but I was there. And it hurts me. And I just want to say I'm sorry,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c I know I have done the unthinkable and I deserve to be punished, but I have also helped in some ways with the conviction of one of my co-defendants and helping the truth come out. \u201d \u2014 Maggie Bennett\n\nDupas and Rajcok were both sentenced in January 2005 for their roles in the brutal slaying. Both tried to have their multi-decade sentences reduced, but a judge refused, citing the \u201cheinous nature of this crime.\u201d\n\nFoster was the only one of the eight defendants to go to trial. After several of his former friends testified in court, he was convicted and sentenced to 100 years in prison.\n\n\u201cPrisons are for people like you,\u201d Judge Thomas O\u2019Keefe said at the sentencing, calling him and Walter\u2019s plan \u201ca perfect storm of evil.\u201d\n\nSeger was the last to be sentenced\u2014to 30 years in April 2006, after pleading guilty to felony murder. Although Seger originally took police to the secluded house where Maryann was murdered, she denied being there for the killing. Later, she described seeing Walter and Foster take \"an oblong object\" out of the van and roll it into the water.\n\n\u201cThey claimed it was a dead dog,\u201d Seger allegedly told police.\n\nFor Johnson, the release of one of the eight is heartbreaking. What\u2019s worse, she said, is the lack of empathy from the prison system.\n\n\u201cI called the warden a few weeks ago to ask to speak to Maggie,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was so cold and brushed me off. I totally feel like the justice system failed my sister.\u201d\n\nShe said the one thing she wants people to remember about her sister is not her murder\u2014but her laugh.\n\n\u201cIt was so obnoxious,\u201d she said while laughing herself. \u201cIt was a stupid, loud laugh that made everyone else laugh. I miss that laugh and her voice. I don\u2019t remember her voice.\u201d", "description": "Maryann Measles, 13, was abducted, raped and drowned in a notorious slaying orchestrated by some older friends.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569196242/190922-melendez-killer-measals-tease_akx8cd", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
