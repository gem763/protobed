About two-thirds of parents in the US are working parents, and the question at the top of many of their minds is: How can we make this work?\n\nI've spent the past five years studying over 100 working couples from across the globe (many of whom were parents) to understand what it takes to thrive in love and in work. I've found that successful working parents \u2014 those who build careers they are proud of, as well as a solid family life \u2014 followed three key steps.\n\nStep 1: Agree as a couple on a set of parenting principles\n\nFirst, working parents should explicitly agree on a set of principles about how they will parent their kids and how they will split parenting responsibilities.\n\nThere are many different approaches to parenting, all of which can produce well-adjusted kids if mindfully adopted. Some of us want to be involved in all aspects of our children's lives; others prefer a more hands-off approach and value the early development of independence. Some of us want our extended families to be intimately involved in raising our children; others prefer a nuclear-family approach. Some push their kids to achieve; others prefer to let their kids discover their talents under their own steam.\n\nParenting principles are the foundation on which the practicalities of parenting lie. Working parents who've thrived, I've found, negotiated and explicitly agreed on their principles when they first became parents and revisited them as their children grew. Once working parents had their principles set, they could work through the practicalities of being parents and sustaining two meaningful careers.\n\nA key question all working parents need to face is how they will split parenting responsibilities. Parenting responsibilities are not simply a question of dividing time \u2014 for example, whose turn is it to pick the kids up from school today? \u2014 they are also a question of dividing mind: Who is responsible for keeping in mind the healthcare appointments, the friends network, the holiday childcare plans?\n\nWorking parents who do well often adopt a \"divide and conquer\" strategy. That is, they claim responsibility for different aspects of parenting. This clarity makes it less likely for things to fall through the cracks because both parents assumed the other was taking responsibility for a certain task. It also means that both parents benefit from the joys of being invested in their children's lives.\n\nSome couples agree to have a lead parent who takes the lion's share of parenting responsibilities; others divide tasks equally and become true coparents. I found neither model to be inherently better than the other. What made the difference was whether the model was truly agreed on and shared by both parents.\n\nStep 2: Build a solid support network where you're not afraid to ask for help\n\nThe second important step for working parents to take is to build a solid support network of babysitters, neighbors, grandparents, friends, and other working parents who either regularly help out with or provide reliable backup for their childcare and family logistics needs.\n\nJennifer Petriglieri, the author of \"Couples That Work: How Dual-Career Couples Can Thrive in Love and Work.\" Courtesy of Jennifer Petriglieri\n\nWorking parents can find it hard to ask for help. They may not want to bother others, or they may feel guilty about having others care for their children.\n\nThe truth is, all parents need a support network \u2014 working or not. When we have a solid support network, it reduces our anxiety, allows us to give ourselves fully to our work when we are at the office, and makes us more relaxed parents.\n\nI've found that one of the best sources of backup childcare for working parents was other working parents. It can be easier to lean on other working parents in tough times because they too understand the challenges of keeping two careers and a family afloat, and can be particularly sympathetic to last-minute emergencies. One father said, \"Our best friends [who were also a working couple] get our lives in a way that others don't. Even though they are busy, I don't think twice to call on them when we're in a pinch because I know they understand and won't pass judgement.\"\n\nStep 3: Toss out the idea of a 'perfect family'\n\nThe third thing that successful working parents do is resist social pressure to conform to the image of the \"ideal family.\"\n\nThis pressure is strong. In the US, there is a widespread ideal of intensive parenting: a pressure to be fully involved in every aspect of our children's lives and a sentiment that if we aren't, our children will somehow fail, and it will be our fault.\n\nThis puts incredible pressure on working parents \u2014 unnecessary pressure. One of the most interesting things about interviewing couples from across the globe was that it exposed these images of the ideal family for what they really were: myths. People in one culture may believe certain things are ideal, and another culture could believe the opposite.\n\nAnd guess what? Parents in all cultures can raise healthy, well-adjusted kids. When working parents were able to resist these expectations and instead proudly claim the parenting principles and practicalities that worked for them, they could truly thrive in love and in work.\n\nOne couple who adopted a hands-off parenting style that was uncommon in their West Coast community told me how they could resist the pressure to conform to the helicopter-parent model because \"we both strongly valued bringing up independent children, and we knew that helicoptering simply didn't align with our values. Our clarity made it easier to politely push back against the norms.\"", "description": "I've found that successful working parents \u2014 those who build careers they are proud of, as well as a solid family life \u2014 followed three key steps.", "authors": ["Jennifer Petriglieri"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9baf44af9090ab12cfa86?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
