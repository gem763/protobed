I didn't feel bad,\" said Tsitsipas, who has yet to beat Medvedev after five career meetings.\n\n\"I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat him the next time or the time after that one, but I know there's going to be a time where I'm going to find opportunities and beat him.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic, Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer, Dominic Thiem, Medvedev and Tsitsipas have all booked places in the ATP Finals, with two spots still up for grabs at the season-ending tournament in London.\n\nWorld number six Zverev strengthened his position in the Race To London standings with a 6-3 6-4 win over Italian Matteo Berrettini.\n\nThe victory helped Zverev climb to seventh with 2,855 points in the race, 330 points more than eighth-placed Berrettini.\n\nZverev heads into his first Shanghai Masters final with a 4-0 head-to-head record against Medvedev, although their most recent meeting came over a year ago in Toronto.\n\n\"We've played some fantastic matches, all going my way until now. I hope tomorrow that will not change,\" fifth seed Zverev said.\n\n\"He's probably the best player in the world right now. I hope it's just going to be a good match tomorrow.\"", "description": "Medvedev extends hot streak to set up Shanghai final with Zverev", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9B0FW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
