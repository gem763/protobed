In order to travel on flights to the United Kingdom, an emotional support dog must have specific training and a certification \"from an accredited body for assistance dogs worldwide\", according to Norwegian Air.\n\nThe flight took off 20 minutes later than scheduled, according to Flightview.\n\n\"The support dogs were fully verified and met all requirements, including passports and paperwork, when passing through airport security and boarding,\" a Gatwick Airport spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThis documentation also likely included a letter from a mental health professional stating that the passenger needed the emotional support animal for air travel or at the destination, in line with Norwegian Air's requirements for emotional support dogs.\n\nPhotos of the dogs that circulated on Twitter appeared to be either blocked or taken down at the time of writing.", "description": "A Norwegian air captain decided to offload two owners and their emotional support dogs, the airline company said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/68/64/1000x563_cmsv2_20e07a26-a37e-530d-8cc6-f3f3cd75d03e-4256864.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
