A smart performance at both ends.\n\nAdama Traore (Wolves)\n\nThe former Barcelona junior had scored just once in the Premier League for Wolves before the final 10 minutes at the Etihad on Sunday.\n\nThen, having spent much of the game shackling Raheem Sterling while operating as a wing-back, the flying Spaniard burst through the heart of Manchester City\u2019s defence on two occasions, and coolly finished past Ederson both times.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo has worked hard with the rapid winger in recent months, and he\u2019s repaid him by arguably being the side\u2019s best player so far this term.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nConor Hourihane (Aston Villa)\n\nAston Villa arrived at Carrow Road with a game plan, to press Norwich players repeatedly, getting in their faces and then picking off mistakes.\n\nNo-one did that better than Conor Hourihane, brought back into the Villa side at the heart of midfield.\n\nThe 28 year-old ran amok in Norfolk, assisting Wesley\u2019s second, winning a penalty and then scoring with an excellent strike himself.\n\nJames Milner (Liverpool)\n\nA typically industrious display from the ex-England international, who proved decisive in the key moments as Liverpool moved eight points clear at the top of the table.\n\nIt was Milner\u2019s penalty that ultimately handed the Reds victory in the 95th minute, but his role in Sadio Mane\u2019s opener shouldn\u2019t be underestimate, a fine, arcing pass - with his weaker foot - catching out Jonny Evans.\n\n\u201cExceptional,\u201d declared Jurgen Klopp post-game. He certainly was.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJack Grealish (Aston Villa)\n\nPushed from a central midfield role into the front three for Villa this weekend, captain Grealish was outstanding in the Villans\u2019 5-1 thumping of Norwich City.\n\nTypically he was at the heart of everything good about Dean Smith\u2019s side, scoring, creating chances, and having more touches and making more passes in the opposing half than any other Villa player (50 and 34).\n\nHis goal was a fine finish, but was only his first in the Premier League this term. His next task is adding more to his game.\n\nAaron Connolly (Brighton)\n\nAs far as first Premier League starts go, Aaron Connolly\u2019s takes some beating.\n\nThe 19 year-old Irish forward was here, there and everywhere against Spurs, with a whizzing display where he seemingly covered every blade of grass.\n\nSpurs defence couldn\u2019t get a handle on his speed and movement, while he also linked smartly with Neale Maupay. His goals were the icing on the cake.\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nTammy Abraham (Chelsea)\n\n\"He\u2019s not just a handful for defenders,\u201d says Frank Lampard. \u201cHe has good feet, holds up the ball well. He is also getting goals which is brilliant for him.\u201d\n\nAnd again, the England forward, back in the Three Lions squad this month, was on target at St Mary\u2019s.\n\nAbraham is the leading goalscorer in the Premier League right now - level with Sergio Aguero - and Southampton \u2019s defenders will be having nightmares following his showing.\n\nThe Chelsea striker is really coming of age this term.", "description": "Liverpool moved eight points clear heading into the international break, as Manchester City and Manchester United both lost", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Getty Images", "Neil Hall Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525083.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Premier-League-Manchester-City-v-Wolverhampton-Wanderers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
