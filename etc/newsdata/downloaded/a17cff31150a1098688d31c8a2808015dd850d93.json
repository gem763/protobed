In. The. World. Oof. And we need to do something about it. Let\u2019s start with cleaning up our nutrition.\n\nWas that a giant sigh?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s hard. The internet is filled with so much info about how to eat healthily that it\u2019s actually become overwhelming. Between the fad diets, food trends, superfoods and the long list of dos and don\u2019ts \u2013 healthy eating just seems, well, complicated.\n\nAdd to that our industrialised food system, all that ultra-processed fast food aimed at our \u2018convenience\u2019 \u2013 and we\u2019ve moved further and further away from nutritious food.\n\nREAD MORE: Running Is Your Best Bet If You\u2019re Genetically Prone To Obesity, According To This New Study\n\nBut obesity is a national problem, and we need to do something about it\u2026\n\nCarol Browne of the Nutrition Society of South Africa (NSSA) points out that the obesity rates in SA are alarming. \u201cApproximately 13.3% of South African children under five years of age are overweight or obese; and according to the 2012 South African Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES), 14.2% children aged six to 14 years are overweight or obese,\u201d she explains.\n\nAnd amongst adults, the numbers are even worse. According to the 2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey, 68% of women and 31% of men in South Africa are overweight or obese. Severe obesity is life-threatening and affects around 20% of women and 3% of men, she says.\n\nREAD MORE: Do You Really Need To Give Up Carbs To Lose Weight?\n\nThe devastating results\n\nThis year, SA was ranked as the unhealthiest country in the world by The Indigo Wellness Index \u2013 an index based on factors such as life expectancy, obesity, depression and inactivity. Our unhealthy habits led to the Heart and Stroke Foundation South Africa (HSFSA) reporting 225 cardiovascular disease-related deaths (CVD) per day. HSFSA\u2019s CEO Professor Pamela Naidoo says: \u201cSouth Africa has one of the highest rates of overweight and obesity in the world, a major contributor to diabetes, which in turn is a risk factor for CVD.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: How Meal-Time Planning Can Improve Appetite And Aid Fat-Burn, According To A Study\n\nSmall changes, major benefits\n\nChanging the obesity stats in SA means addressing our problem nutrition. Eating healthy foods doesn\u2019t have to be challenging, nor does it mean completing giving up your favourite foods. In fact, according to registered dietician and ADSA spokesperson Jessica Byrne, if you want to stay on track for the long run, moderation is key.\n\n\u201cRather than putting yourself under unnecessary pressure to always make the healthy choice, try using the 80:20 principle: 80% of the time make the healthier choice, and then allow yourself that 20% for a treat now and then, without feeling guilty about it,\u201d she suggests.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s How To Make Weight Loss Goals That Will Actually Stick\n\nWhen it comes to the types of foods you should be including in your meals, whole foods are best. These are foods that are not processed or minimally processed \u2013 think vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.\n\nJessica\u2019s advice: Set a goal to eat fruit and vegetables every day, or to include dry beans, peas, lentils or soya in your meals a few times a week. Also, don\u2019t forget about hydration. Choose water instead of sugary drinks, and plan and prepare healthy home meals rather than buying ready-to-eat meals/snacks or eating out frequently.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "It doesn't have to be complicated.", "authors": ["Chandr\u00e9 Davids"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9167/865fe7ac2d5c42288b9b7d2721019f0a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
