Maybe his memory is failing. He did after all famously forget which football team he supports.\u2019", "description": "An 'incandescent' Mr Davis is demanding that his one-time rival for the Tory crown retract claims made in his book and on television about their testy political relationship.", "authors": ["Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19637770-0-image-a-14_1570917119131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
