It wasn\u2019t our fault, we didn\u2019t intentionally put the blood down there. We didn\u2019t want this to happen. We feel for them. I\u2019d be just as mad as they are, in their shoes,\u201d she told WHO-TV.\n\nDahl said the tile connected to a pipe that is shared with the Lestina family has been covered with concrete to prevent future incidents, and the company is planning to help the family with clean-up.\n\n\u201cWe are arguing with our insurance company to try to get them to cover it, otherwise we will financially assist the Lestinas,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating the incident and is working with the Dahls to prevent future incidents.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 An Iowa meat processing business is apologizing to a neighboring family after a shared drainage system caused their basement to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
