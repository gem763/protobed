Ethical concerns about relatives have long dogged presidents. Even with Trump\u2019s own vulnerability on cronyism and a slew of ethics issues, some Democrats may be looking for a candidate without even the whiff of scandal. Biden\u2019s camp seems to be arguing that embarking on such a quest is giving in to Trump, since he\u2019ll try to tar anyone the Dems offer up.\n\nHeather: The Biden campaign hopes that confronting the issue and dismissing the allegations against Hunter now will neutralize the issue in the general election. The strategy appears to be one designed to show Biden not shying away Trump\u2019s claims about his son, many of which lack evidence. It\u2019s another way for Biden to prove he\u2019s the best candidate to take on Trump.\n\nWhat do the latest developments mean for the State Department and Secretary Mike Pompeo, as they are both dragged into \u2014 or willingly stepped into \u2014 the political vortex?\n\nMelanie: Now we know Rudy Guiliani wasn\u2019t just freelancing in his Ukraine pressure campaign: U.S. diplomats were actively pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden and the 2016 election on behalf of Trump. Expect Democrats to paint a picture of a president who was using foreign diplomacy for personal gain. This could also damage the credibility of Pompeo, who is said to have political ambitions of his own.\n\nBen: Aside from the question of whether Pompeo is implicated in the scandal, the fact that the president had his personal lawyer running a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine further undermines the State Department\u2019s standing. I also expect the role of Rick Perry and U.S. energy policy to become a bigger part of this story\n\nJosh: We\u2019re starting to learn more about what the key players in Ukraine policy knew about all this. Special Envoy Kurt Volker\u2019s insistence that the investigation he was pressing Ukraine to commit to in order get a visit to the White House was not at all a probe into Joe Biden seems implausibly na\u00efve for a sophisticated diplomat. But there must be many other players in this saga at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, at the State Department and at the National Security Council, who know at least as much as the CIA whistleblower, if not more.\n\nAs for Pompeo, everyone has wondered how he\u2019s managed to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces, where so many other officials have not. His actions to bolster Trump\u2019s political goals with the Ukrainians help explain the unusual favor Pompeo has enjoyed in a Cabinet that has seen incredible turnover.\n\nHeather: For Pompeo, everything is likely viewed, at least in part, through the lens of how this could impact his long-term political career. He is rumored to be considering a Senate run in his home state of Kansas and has notably refused to rule out the possibility. He has been, and remains, a close ally and defender of Trump, and seems to have earned the president\u2019s trust in a way that some of Trump\u2019s other current and former cabinet officials weren\u2019t able to do. Pompeo has continued to define himself as a fierce defender of the president, as evidenced earlier this week when he threatened to block State Department officials from testifying as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhere does Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s credibility stand with lawmakers and the public now that it has been revealed that he enlisted the White House \u2014 and in some cases, President Donald Trump personally \u2014 in seeking international cooperation in the probe into how the Trump-Russia investigation began?\n\nMelanie: Democrats have long viewed Barr suspiciously, ever since he put out that initial summary of the Mueller report and took the extraordinary step of determining Trump did not obstruct justice. They say he is acting like the president\u2019s personal attorney as opposed to the nation\u2019s attorney. The whole Ukraine episode is only to give Democrats more ammunition, but I don\u2019t expect them to target Barr with something like a censure resolution or trying to get him disbarred \u2014 they have bigger fish to fry.\n\nBen: Normally, an attorney general will go to lengths to avoid the appearance of politicizing the Justice Department (though they often fall short). Few things appear more political than investigating the origins of an investigation into the president. Then again, pressuring a foreign government to investigate your rival counts as one of those few things, so, as Melanie points out, Barr may luck out here by finding the story move past him.\n\nJosh: Democratic lawmakers soured on Barr long ago., especially for what they regarded as spin that he put on the Mueller report. But that was mostly a complaint that he gave a skewed preview of a report that was made public in large part a few weeks later.\n\nThe confirmation this week that Barr asked Trump to reach out to world leaders to seek cooperation in Justice Department\u2019s ongoing review of the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation is a highly irregular step because of Trump\u2019s direct personal and political interest in the outcomes of that review. Why couldn\u2019t State Department officials or ambassadors have handled that outreach? Dems are focused on a bigger target at the moment, but Barr\u2014who portrays himself as a by-the-book type\u2014 will have to grapple with these questions eventually.\n\nHeather: When Barr initially took the position, many Democrats were privately relieved that a career official with a long history of government service would be assuming the important role as the nation\u2019s top cop. But after Barr\u2019s handling of the Mueller report drew accusations that he was seeking to defend and protect Trump, Democrats have universally soured on the attorney general. Barr\u2019s credibility in their eyes only continues to diminish as more information comes out about his attempts to validate Trump\u2019s efforts to discredit the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr has also been the public face of the Justice Department\u2019s all-out blockade of House Democrats\u2019 sprawling oversight requests, and some of those disputes are still playing out in federal court.\n\nWhere are we at the end of this week? Do impeachment/a Senate trial/other damaging outcomes for Trump seem more likely after the disclosures of the past seven days?\n\nBen: Trump\u2019s impeachment does seem more likely, especially in light of the president asking China to investigate the Bidens and the disclosure of text messages in which one U.S. diplomat made it clear he believed the administration was withholding security assistance to Ukraine in order to help Trump\u2019s reelection. We\u2019ve also seen a number of figures involved in this saga, including Rudy Giuliani and his associate Lev Parnas, lawyer up, another sign that we are in for another full-blown Washington legal-political showdown. It\u2019s shaping up to be a Mueller re-match.\n\nMelanie: It\u2019s quickly becoming a question of when, not if, Democrats put articles of impeachment on the House floor. It just depends on when they feel like they have enough evidence to make a convincing case to the American public. There are a whole lot of dots \u2014 and now Democrats need to connect them. But things are a little more murky in the Senate: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear that he has to consider impeachment if the House follows through, but he hasn\u2019t indicated how long the trial will last or if he will just move to dismiss it immediately.\n\nJosh: We\u2019re definitely closer to impeachment now, largely because of the new disclosures about Trump\u2019s Ukraine strategy being operationalized by diplomats.\n\nBut an even bigger problem for the president may be his decision that he\u2019ll defend himself against impeachment on the fly, without heeding professional advice. This--and goading from reporters--seems to lead to ever-escalating claims on the president\u2019s part about his right to do anything he wants to tar Biden. Trump\u2019s China comments triggered new criticism from Romney. But Trump\u2019s inability to stick to a clear message--like when he denied a quid pro quo and then suggested that he\u2019d be entirely justified in offering one-- has even complicated the efforts of those trying to help him. He routinely saws off boards that his allies are presently standing on.\n\nHeather: Democrats saw this week as a victory in their efforts to paint Trump\u2019s conduct as an abuse of his power and of the office of the presidency. But they also feel like they succeeded in another area \u2014 keeping momentum behind the impeachment inquiry and winning the messaging war against a president who generally dictates the direction of the news cycle on a daily basis. For Democrats, it\u2019s something many felt they weren\u2019t able to do in the aftermath of the Mueller investigation, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders remained opposed to an impeachment investigation.\n\nImpeachment seems almost inevitable, especially after the release of damning text messages from senior diplomats discussing Trump\u2019s desire to exert his leverage over foreign leaders in order to satisfy his political objectives. In addition, Democrats are showing they have no intention of slowing down their investigation, with subpoenas (or the threat of one) slapped on Pompeo and the White House. And on Friday, Democrats further escalated their inquiry by demanding Vice President Mike Pence turn over any documents he has related to the Ukraine controversy.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/73/8b/d64918ec47fb9050e85ae500e250/191004-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
