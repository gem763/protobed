NSO said it is looking into the allegations.\n\nMonjib said he believed he was spied on because of his involvement in the pro-democracy movement in Morocco. He is the co-founder of the NGO Freedom Now organization, which advocates for a free press in Morocco.\n\nThe Amnesty report explains how one particular NSO product, known as the Pegasus spyware platform, used text messages with embedded malware targeting Monjib and Bouchattaoui to collect information stored on their cellphones.\n\n\u201cI knew I was being monitored by state intelligence but I didn\u2019t know how (before),\u201d said Bouchattaoui.\n\nThe booby-trapped text messages, reviewed by Amnesty, were sent between 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cYou cannot count on companies like NSO to disclose how their products are used to repress and snoop. That is why technical research like Amnesty\u2019s latest report is so critical to the debate,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher with the digital civil society group Citizen Lab. \u201cWe are confident that this is indeed NSO.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Amnesty discovered Monjib\u2019s iPhone was targeted again in 2019 through a series of \u201cnetwork injection attacks.\u201d\n\nWhen Monjib attempted to visit a French language-version of Yahoo\u2019s email service in Morocco he was instead redirected to a suspicious webpage.\n\nIt is unclear whether malware was download through this page. But the activity raised flags. Typically, such an attack requires \u201cprivileged access to a target\u2019s network connection\u201d in order to hijack their internet traffic, the report explains.\n\nSecurity experts say this type of hacking technique is most common in countries where the government is in control of the domestic telecommunications industry.", "description": "Moroccan human rights activists have been targeted by hackers armed with sophisticated computing spying software amid a government crackdown on protests in recent years, according to research by Amnesty International.", "authors": ["Christopher Bing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
