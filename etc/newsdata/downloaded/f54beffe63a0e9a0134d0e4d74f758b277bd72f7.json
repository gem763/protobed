But now, as reports of the chaotic, alcohol-fueled culture at WeWork proliferate, employees are getting nervous that the experience could actually count against them as they look for new jobs, an executive told Reeves Wiedeman at New York Magazine's Intelligencer.\n\nWeWork's Neumann presided over a company in which mandatory parties, nepotism and over-the-top behavior flourished, as detailed in an in-depth Business Insider report. Now the office sharing company is trying to rehabilitate its image and impose financial discipline to staunch its financial losses.\n\n\"Thousands of people who worked tirelessly, because there's no other way to do it there, are going to end up screwed financially because they took lower income to have more equity that has disintegrated,\"one executive told Reeves Wiedeman at New York Magazine's Intelligencer. Several employees reported using their savings to buy stock options, which could leave them financially ruined.

Some were ready for a post-Neumann WeWork, but many wondered why the executives hadn't done more to keep Neumann in check. CFO Minson, formerly a Time Warner Executive, joined WeWork in 2015. Neumann once referred to him as the \"adult in the room.\" Gunningham was vice-chairman of WeWork before taking on the new role.\n\nIntelligencer reported that the most used reactions to the news on Slack were the WeWork logo, and emojis \ud83d\ude10, \ud83d\ude2e, and \ud83d\ude43. The co-CEOs said that they would act transparently, and that this was just the beginning, on a conference call with the entire company.\n\nRead more:How WeWork spiraled from a $47 billion valuation to talk of bankruptcy in just 6 weeks\n\nOn a call with senior employees the next day, Gunningham warned anyone not on board with a potentially difficult transition that they \"should probably consider getting out,\" Intelligencer reported.\n\nThe WeWork employee concerns about their work history echo those of Uber employees at the height of its controversies a couple of years ago.
