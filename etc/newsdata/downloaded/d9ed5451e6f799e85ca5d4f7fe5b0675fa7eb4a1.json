That allegation is false.\"\n\nMs Yovanovitch said she had never met or spoken with Hunter Biden and that Joe Biden had never raised with her the subject of his son or the Ukrainian gas firm that employed him.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nShe also said she learned that Mr Trump had called for her ousting since 2018 despite Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan telling her she had done nothing wrong.\n\n\"He said that the president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me,\" Ms Yovanovitch said.\n\nA Barack Obama-appointee, Ms Yovanovitch was confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate and served as US ambassador to Ukraine from August 2016 until last May.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint noted her surprise dismissal was a red flag for some officials.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims\n\nWho else has been called to testify?\n\nHouse Democrats also heard earlier this month from Ukraine Special Envoy Kurt Volker.\n\nHe revealed text messages between US diplomats documenting the Trump administration's efforts to have Ukraine investigate the company that employed Mr Biden's son.\n\nOn Friday, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland confirmed he would comply with a House subpoena to face the Democratic-led committees on 17 October.\n\nMr Sondland's first scheduled appearance earlier this week was blocked by his bosses at the Department of State.\n\nWhat's the inquiry about?\n\nAccording to the whistleblower's complaint, some aides were concerned Mr Trump was soliciting interference from a foreign government for his own personal political interests during his White House call with President Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats have accused Mr Trump of withholding US aid while urging Ukraine to investigate corruption claims against his rival, 2020 Democratic contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked with a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nOfficials in Kiev have said there is no evidence to support the allegation, which the Biden camp calls a smear.\n\nThe president denies any wrongdoing. On Thursday, Mr Zelensky also said there was \"no blackmail\" in the phone call.", "description": "The former US ambassador to Ukraine says people with \"clearly questionable motives\" wanted her gone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/945B/production/_109197973_gettyimages-1175337376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
