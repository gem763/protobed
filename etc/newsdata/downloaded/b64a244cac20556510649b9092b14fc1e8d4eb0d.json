She had not lost since Gotzis in 2016.\n\nBut Johnson-Thompson sent out a major warning to Thiam ahead of next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo and won Great Britain\u2019s second gold in Qatar after Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s 200m victory on Wednesday.\n\nThe Liverpudlian joins an exclusive club of eight British women to have won individual world gold \u2013 including Asher-Smith and Ennis-Hill, who has three heptathlon titles.\n\nIt was also sweet redemption after her nightmare World Championships in Beijing in 2015 following three long jump failures and a high jump shocker in London two years ago.\n\nA poor long jump and javelin from Thiam put Johnson-Thompson in control on the second day at the Khalifa International Stadium.\n\nJohnson-Thompson won the long jump with a leap of 6.77m \u2013 well ahead of Thiam\u2019s 6.35m \u2013 which gave her a lead of 216 points with two events left.\n\nThiam tried to recover in the javelin but, hampered by a long-standing elbow injury, walked off the track before her final throw having posted just 48.04m.\n\nJohnson-Thompson\u2019s new personal best of 43.93m gave her a virtually unassailable 137-point lead heading into the 800m.\n\nShe then completed the upset with a time of two minutes 07.26 seconds in the 800m.\n\nTwo personal bests in the 100m hurdles and shot put helped Johnson-Thompson to an overnight 96-point lead over Thiam.\n\nEarlier, Laura Muir qualified for Saturday\u2019s 1500m final with a run of four minutes 01.05 seconds to come third in her semi-final.\n\nThe 26-year-old has recovered from a torn calf which wrecked her preparations for Doha.\n\nShe said: \u201cEveryone talks about the final but you have to actually get there first. These girls are fast, a 4:01 there for a semi-final, I\u2019m really happy to run that time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back and am confident with my body. It is a good confidence boost, we\u2019ve got a couple of days now. It\u2019s gives me a lot of confidence knowing I can run that sort of time feeling comfortably.\u201d\n\nBritish trio of Jake Wightman, Josh Kerr and Neil Gourley also reached the men\u2019s 1500m semi final.\n\nMeanwhile, world record holder and defending champion Kevin Mayer of France pulled out of the decathlon injured and Bahrain\u2019s Salwa Eld Naser won a surprise women\u2019s 400m title.", "description": "Great Britain\u2019s\u00a0Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u00a0sprung a huge upset to claim a stunning heptathlon gold medal at the World Championships.
