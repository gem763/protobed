Date night? Hen dos? The expectation for drinking is hard to escape.\n\nTo mark this national month of sobriety, we spoke to people who decided to ditch booze all together and say it\u2019s the best thing they\u2019ve ever done \u2013 both physically and mentally.\n\nDom McGregor, COO of Social Chain, realised he was drinking too much when he founded his business around five years ago. As a start-up, his business grew extremely quickly, with reasons to celebrate every week \u2013 be it an amazing new client or a new starter. This culture for celebration led to weekly drinks. But with this growing business came increased responsibilities for Dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Instead of these weekends being celebratory I found they were self-medicating,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I was spending a lot of time going out drinking, but it wasn\u2019t to enjoy the feeling of the party it was literally to get drunk \u2013 so that in my head all the problems would disappear \u2013 and they did temporarily.\n\n\u2018It spiralled when I would get more and more drunk. The speed of drink would increase, the strength of the drink would increase. I would get completely out of control. There were a number of things that happened during this spiral that made me start to think subconsciously about what was going on.\n\n\u2018Firstly I broke my ankle on a Thursday and needed to go to A&E on Friday when I had clients emailing me asking me for things which obviously I couldn\u2019t do. I also kept embarrassing myself and making a fool of myself to the team and that was something that I started to get a reputation for.\n\n\u2018And then one day, after a full day of drinking at the races, one of the guys from work was trying to help get me home \u2013 because I was uncontrollable \u2013 and I was derogatory towards him. He\u2019s one of my closest friends. When I heard what I had said to him, with no memory of it, I realised I was someone that I never wanted to be.\n\n\u2018To me that hammered home something was wrong.\u2019\n\nDom decided to see a therapist who told him he had anxiety over his future, low self-esteem and Imposter Syndrome and that he was taking it out on himself by turning to alcohol. His therapist advised him to give up alcohol. The first month was a struggle but Dom pushed through and has been sober ever since.\n\nDom before and after he stopped drinking (@dpjmcgregor)\n\nDom says there\u2019s been a huge rise in female sobriety over the past few years, but he thinks there needs to be more of a focus on male sobriety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Veganism and sobriety are two things I think women lead the way in and I think the male space is massively under-represented,\u2019 he tells us.\n\n\u2018The expectation of male activities and male lifestyle choices revolve around alcohol \u2013 the expectation when you go to say football or business meetings. The expectation is very common within the male lifestyle. I think there\u2019s a lot of work to be done for young men especially to feel comfortable about a life without drinking.\u2019\n\nIn terms of advice he would give to others thinking of giving up drinking, Dom says: \u2018Everything that alcohol gives you temporarily \u2013 the energy, the humour, the confidence \u2013 you can achieve being sober forever.\u2019\n\nBritish food writer, journalist and author Jack Monroe is another person who has ditched drinking for good. Earlier this year she wrote a piece for the Guardian about coming to terms with the fact that she was an alcoholic.\n\nShe tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018It\u2019s been just over nine months since I recognised that my relationship with alcohol is an unhealthy one \u2013 I was using it heavily as a coping mechanism for past traumas and low self-esteem \u2013 and it was affecting my work, my friendships, and my family.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not been easy, and I\u2019ve admitted that I\u2019ve slipped up a couple of times, but I\u2019m definitely more emotionally stable, more productive, sleeping better than I ever have done.\n\n\u2018I have been overwhelmed by the support of my family and friends; people making sure there are alcohol-free options at work events, friends bringing me nice sparkling grown-up soft drinks when I make them dinner. It\u2019s an all-round positive change and I\u2019d encourage anyone who might be considering it, to give it a go.\u2019\n\nDrinking is a part of everyday life for many (Picture: Ella Byworth/ Getty)\n\nNicole Sage, from Plymouth, gave up alcohol six years ago for health reasons \u2013 following a pancreatitis diagnosis. Now, aged 27, she\u2019s a commercial director for a baby company BabyDam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicole said: \u2018I unfortunately had pancreatitis when I was 17, which is incredibly rare for someone of my age,\u2019 she explains. \u2018At the time I had no support, indication to what caused it or advice on what I would need to avoid in the future.\n\n\u2018The doctors basically said I had to stop drinking and it was honestly the best thing I have ever done with my life.\n\n\u2018My life changed for the better in my health and personal life. Along with the confidence that I gained which wasn\u2019t found at the bottom of a bottle, so did my self-worth. I know who I am now and know where I want to be in life. There is nothing that overshadows how I feel or perform in my daily life now.\u2019\n\nThere are both health and financial benefits to going teetotal (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nRichard Maule decided to give up alcohol almost a year ago and his fianc\u00e9 Jade followed suit, six months later. The pair have both seen substantial health and financial benefits from their decision to go teetotal.\n\nRichard says: \u2018The first couple of months were challenging especially during social situations but the longer I persevered the easier it got and actually it challenged me to find confidence whilst being sober and to seek out more interesting ways to spend my time with friends.\n\n\u2018Instead of going to a bar and getting drunk, we\u2019d do things like go to low key music gigs, go rock climbing or do a martial arts class together \u2013 which actually meant we had better quality time together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This naturally started to translate into a healthier lifestyle and a better diet as I felt I also had better control over my food choices with no binges due to hangovers. Since cutting out alcohol I have also experienced much better sleep, which in turn has given me a greater clarity of mind. It\u2019s had a huge impact on my life coaching business and relationship too as I have a lot more capacity to be patient and understanding.\n\n\u2018My fianc\u00e9, Jade, has also experienced life-changing benefits. She used to regularly suffer with periods of low mood but since stopping drinking alcohol they have significantly improved and she almost never experiences them anymore.\n\n\u2018We generally have a much happier life than before. Our decision to stop drinking has allowed us to put money aside and move to Bali this year, thanks to cheaper living cost.\n\n\u2018We are also saving around \u00a3400 a month from not drinking \u2013 so we live a pretty abundant life out here. We\u2019d never look back.\u2019\n\nSwap the Tia Maria for a tea (Picture: Mmuffn for Metro.co.uk)\n\nCai Graham, a parenting coach, saw alcohol as a de-stressor and a reward. She decided to make a change after realising she was using alcohol as a \u2018crutch\u2019.\n\n\u2018For a very long time, booze had been a big part of my life. For as long as I can remember, most of my family gatherings and social occasions revolved around me having a glass in my hand.\n\n\u2018As a young mum, my frazzled nerves were softened with a chilled glass of Sauvignon or my signature gin, lime and soda. Booze was daily de-stressor and my reward. I used to see these celebrities on TV saying they were sober and I couldn\u2019t even imagine my life without booze.\n\n\u2018I convinced myself that is was a fun part of my life. The crunch came when my daughter, then aged 10, wanted a lift to see a friend and asked me to pick her up at 9pm. I begrudgingly agreed \u2013 blaming her for denying me my gin.\n\n\u2018This pulled me up short. This \u201cfun part of my life\u201d was now my crutch.\n\n\u2018Knowing myself as I do \u2013 booze had to be \u201call or nothing for me\u201d. So after inhaling Allen Carr\u2019s book The Easy Way to Control Drink \u2013 the decision to quit was a no brainer. It was as simple as just making that decision to throw my crutch away\u2026 and the relief was palpable.\n\n\u2018That was 10 years ago.\n\n\u2018My life is great. I have clarity \u2013 none of that brain fog. I have my weekends back as I used to stay in bed till midday \u2013 pretending it was a lie-in. My social circle has shifted a bit, but that\u2019s to be expected I guess. I am so thrilled that I no longer have the paranoia at the weekend, wondering if I have upset anyone or made a fool of myself from the night before.\u2019\n\nMORE: For those that can, going sober for October is brilliant, but alcoholics aren\u2019t getting the help they need\n\nMORE: How do you go sober for October?\n\nMORE: What is Sober for October?
