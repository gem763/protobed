A high-energy Elizabeth Warren urged optimism for building a better America and the former vice-president Joe Biden, who has a pitched a more moderate proposal, said he would push other nations to recommit to stronger action.\n\nSanders said without radical change the world will be uninhabitable. \u201cThe damage to the world will be irreparable,\u201d the Vermont senator said, adding that he is proposing \u201cthe largest, most comprehensive climate plan presented by any presidential candidate in the history of the United States\u201d.\n\nFloridians still divided over climate crisis as Dorian rages Read more\n\nWith many questions focused on what candidates would ask Americans to sacrifice, Elizabeth Warren pushed back on the framing. Asked if the government should tell people what kind of lightbulbs they can have, the Massachusetts senator quipped: \u201cOh come on, give me a break!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption and our pollution,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it is with lightbulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it \u2013 dang \u2013 is on cheeseburgers.\u201d\n\nBut most of the responsibility lies with industry, not individuals, she said, adding \u201cthis is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about\u201d.\n\nBiden meanwhile pitched himself as the candidate who could lead negotiations with the diplomatic might of the US. He said his first step as president would be to call an international meeting to strengthen the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\u201cWe should be organizing the world, demanding change, we need a diplomat-in-chief,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLook what\u2019s happening now in the Amazon, what\u2019s going on? Nothing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Massive fires have burned through the Amazon rainforest in recent weeks.

He claimed the supporter is not a corporate executive.\n\nWhere Biden would invest $1.7tn to fight climate change, Warren proposed $10tn and Sanders would put forward $16.3tn, setting them widely apart.\n\nThe Democrats faced questions on whether their proposals would ban fracking for natural gas, prohibit exports of oil, gas and coal, change nutritional guidelines to limit meat consumption and transition to all electric vehicles.\n\nTheir answers \u2013 and reactions to them \u2013 foreshadowed the fight ahead with conservatives and industry regardless of who becomes the next president.\n\nDonald Trump in a thread on Twitter charged that Democrat plans \u201cwill raise your energy bill and prices at the pump\u201d. The fossil fuels industry, through the oil trade group the American Petroleum Institute and the American Energy Alliance, said the plans would hurt poor Americans.\n\nGreta Thunberg responds to Asperger's critics: 'It's a superpower' Read more\n\n\u201cTonight, while American families worry about making ends meet, the Democrats running for president will be working hard to outbid each other on who can raise electricity and gasoline prices the highest, and the fastest,\u201d the alliance said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe event was perhaps the longest stretch of primetime television ever dedicated to climate change, held after the Democratic National Committee refused to sanction an official climate debate between candidates and amid unprecedented pressure from young activists and the Democratic voting base to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nOn Wednesday, a list of demands was released by a coalition of youth-led groups whose lodestar is Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager and activist who sparked a global wave of walkouts by school students over the climate crisis. Thunberg arrived in New York last week, after crossing the Atlantic in a solar-powered yacht for an upcoming UN climate summit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders has pledged to put forward $16.3tn.

Among all voting Americans, nearly seven in 10 are worried about climate change, the highest ever recorded level of concern. There are strong bipartisan majorities in favour of setting pollution limits on industry, businesses, cars and trucks.\n\nDonald Trump, who is dismantling rules aimed at lowering planet-warming gases, attacked the Democratic candidates for proposing unrealistic, costly plans. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 destructive \u201cenvironmental\u201d proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cDon\u2019t the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign quickly took the opportunity to post a clip of California senator Kamala Harris saying she would ban plastic straws alongside an ad for Trump-branded straws.\n\nBut some young conservatives have raised concerns that Republican intransigence over the climate crisis will cost the party a generation of voters. Recent Newsy-Ipsos polling found that 68% of millennial and Generation Z Republicans support the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of young people who are conservative and believe in climate change \u2026 They will not vote for a Republican if they\u2019re voting on this issue,\u201d said Benjamin Backer, founder of the American Conservation Coalition, which proposes action on the climate crisis. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a problem with the lack of involvement from the Republican Party on this issue for the past 10 years.\u201d", "description": "Candidates warn of \u2018irreparable damage\u2019 in marathon town hall but can\u2019t agree on how aggressively to tackle problem", "authors": ["Emily Holden", "Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c75e72e59c39b5bb814b2339e0c2b29718d9a44e/0_246_4945_2967/master/4945.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8d808927df869cf65c90704c84d69f7", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
