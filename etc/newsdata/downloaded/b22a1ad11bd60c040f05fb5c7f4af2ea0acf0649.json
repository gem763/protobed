Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.'\n\nOn Friday, Prince Harry also began legal action against The Sun and The Mirror for alleged phone hacking.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex holding her son, Archie, during their visit to Cape Town on September 25\n\nThe details have not been made public but are believed to relate to dates in the 2000s when the prince was in his early twenties.\n\nBoth newspapers have paid millions to settle phone hacking claims by celebrities over the same period.\n\nIf Harry decides to shun an out-of-court settlement, it raises the prospect of a serving member of the Royal Family entering the witness box.\n\nUnlike other famous claimants, he might decide he preferred the publicity to the money, if he was trying to make a point.", "description": "Patrick Jephson, who served the British royal from 1988 to 1996, said public sympathy was 'volatile', and the legal battle and potential court appearances would be a 'punishing trek'.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/15/19363192-0-image-a-58_1570371917561.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
