Facebook / Barack Obama\n\nMany young leaders all over the world have probably dreamed of meeting Barack and Michelle Obama \u2013 two of the most popular leaders of our time \u2013 at some point in their lives.\n\nNow, the dream could become reality for 200 lucky young leaders from Asia Pacific.\n\nThe former US president and his wife will speak at the Obama Foundation\u2019s inaugural \u201cLeaders: Asia-Pacific\u201d gathering in Malaysia at the end of the year.\n\nThe event will take place from December 10 to December 14 in Kuala Lumpur, just before the Obamas are scheduled to visit Singapore to speak at separate events held by The Growth Faculty.\n\nAccording to the foundation\u2019s media statement on Tuesday (Oct 15), the Malaysian event will bring together 200 emerging leaders in public and private sectors from more than 30 different nations and territories across the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe four-day gathering will include plenary sessions, skill-building workshops and leadership development training. According to the Obama Foundation, the meetings will have an Asia Pacific perspective that is focused on values-based ethical leadership.\n\nThis is the first event in the foundation\u2019s year-long programme, which will also see a speaker series, technical training sessions, educational workshops, action plan guidance, and support from the foundation.\n\nBernadette Meehan, the Obama Foundation\u2019s chief international officer, said in a statement that the Apac region is of \u201cgreat importance to President Obama given his strong roots in Indonesia and Hawaii\u201d.\n\nShe added that the programme will have \u201ca focus on shared values and ethical leadership\u201d, and that it will \u201cempower these leaders to tackle the unique challenges they face in their communities\u201d.\n\nThe programme builds on the foundation\u2019s work with young leaders over the past two years in Chicago and Johannesburg, and is co-designed by 21 Apac leaders at the Hawaii workshop in January with Barack Obama.\n\nThe 58-year old former US president had said at the Hawaii workshop that the foundation was trying to \u201cpromote a value-based approach to leadership development, because we believe that real leadership involves dialogue and inclusion and tolerance and a commitment to human dignity\u201d.\n\nMichelle Obama announced last Friday (Oct 11) that she would also be travelling to Vietnam in December as part of the foundation\u2019s Girls Opportunity Alliance\u2019s efforts to drive awareness and action on the importance of adolescent girls education.\n\nAs such, the Kuala Lumpur gathering will also include several leaders from across the region who focus on girls\u2019 education and empowerment.\n\nEarlier this year, Barack and Michelle Obama were both ranked eighth on YouGov\u2019s list of Malaysia\u2019s most admired men and women, seven places behind Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Muhamad and singer Siti Nurhaliza respectively.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - They will be in KL for the event from December 10 to December 14..
