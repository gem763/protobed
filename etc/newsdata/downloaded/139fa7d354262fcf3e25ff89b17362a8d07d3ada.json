New York University professor Aswath Damodaran, sometimes called the \"Dean of Valuation,\" said the valuation is \"too high.\"\n\n\"My estimate is about $18 to $19, and that is giving them the benefit of every doubt,\" Damodaran said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Thursday.\n\nIf Peloton trades below $27, it would be on pace to become the second worst debut of a unicorn this year. Uber currently holds the second-place spot with a loss of 7.62%. Online dentistry company SmileDirectClub slid 28% on its debut, the worst market debut for a unicorn start-up in 2019.\n\n\"I think the problem here is you have fundamentally a good business model, but I just don't think it can scale up enough to justify the market cap,\" Damodaran said.\n\nPeloton's offering initially valued the digital fitness company at $8.1 billion, but it raised $1.16 billion.\n\nHowever, Damodaran said unlike Uber and WeWork, Peloton has a path to profitability because of its subscription-based model.\n\n\"To give Peloton credit, their business model is a little more formed than WeWork's and Uber's,\" Damodaran said. \"It's the subscription model that eventually is going to make them profitable. ... It's a gift that keeps on giving.\"\n\nGrowing membership has helped Peloton's sales grow to $915 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, up 110% from $435 million in fiscal 2018.", "description": "Peloton is worth $19 a share at most, according to Wall Street's valuation guru.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104936000-IMG_2342.jpg?v=1515508462", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
