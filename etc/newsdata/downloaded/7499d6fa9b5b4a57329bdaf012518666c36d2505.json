(Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)\n\nPrescott, on the other hand, matched a career high with three interceptions, although the first was a drop by Cooper on what should have been a big play early.\n\nThe Cowboys (3-2) lost their second straight game after winning their first three, just as the Packers had done. Green Bay took sole possession of first in the NFC North, while Dallas dropped into a tie for the NFC East lead with Philadelphia.\n\nJones had a career-high 182 scrimmage yards \u2014 107 rushing and 75 receiving \u2014 and opened the scoring with an 18-yard run after being held to 19 and 21 yards rushing the previous two weeks.\n\nOn a punctuating touchdown for a 24-0 lead early in the second half, Jones waved \"bye-bye\" to cornerback Byron Jones while beating him to the pylon on a 5-yard run. The fourth TD was a 1-yard plunge.\n\nCooper had a 53-yard touchdown among his 11 catches and Michael Gallup had 113 yards receiving with a 40-yard score. Prescott, who had never lost when throwing for more than 275 yards, was 27 of 44.", "description": "Aaron Rodgers looked quite comfortable at the home of the Dallas Cowboys \u2014 again.
