When the foundation went in, his dad asked the builder to add an extra layer of cement blocks to give the house a leg up against any flooding that might come their way.\n\nFor much of the past century, Oswald\u2019s family and farmers in the area lived in relative peace with the Missouri River. That started to change dramatically in 1993, when both the Missouri and Mississippi rivers flooded and sunk more than 300,000 square miles of the heartland under water -- a catastrophe that killed dozens of people and caused $15 billion in damages.\n\nEven then, the flood water didn\u2019t breach the ground floor of Oswald\u2019s farm house. In the years since, there have been numerous scares, when intense rains or snow melts have filled the river to its capacity, causing Oswald and his neighbors to be \u201con edge\u201d year after year, he said.\n\nThe last time Oswald\u2019s land flooded, in 2011, was a turning point for him.\n\n\u201cBefore that I was saying, yes the climate is changing, but I wasn\u2019t ready to say that the change was caused by human activity,\u201d he said. As he looked at the science on rising temperatures and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, he said he became convinced of the connection.\n\nBack in 2011, a bout of extreme rains left upstream reservoirs so overloaded with water that the Army Corps of Engineers had no choice but to stage a controlled flood.\n\nFarmers in Oswald\u2019s area were given three weeks\u2019 notice before the flood water was let loose. Equipment could be taken to higher ground, corn and beans moved out. Oswald\u2019s house was spared.\n\nWhat happened this year was a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in many ways, he said. It had already been one of the wettest years on record in much of the Missouri River watershed when a huge storm \u2014 dubbed a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d \u2014 pummeled the central U.S. in mid-March, dropping massive rain and snow from North Dakota to Colorado. In many places, the ground was too frozen to handle the influx of water, leading to widespread runoff.\n\n\n\nSeveral communities saw the Missouri River and its tributaries rise to levels they had simply never seen before.\n\nIn northeastern Nebraska, one tributary became so overloaded with water and massive chunks of floating ice that it burst through the Spencer Dam \u201cunleashing a wave of water\u201d into the already fast-rising Missouri River, as the federal government would later describe it.\n\n\u201cDams aren\u2019t supposed to collapse,\u201d Oswald said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also supposed to be managed so that they don\u2019t collapse. When you have as much rain and snow as we had, then man has to take that into account. If they don't, why, this is the kind of thing we get. This ignorant denial of the fact that, yeah, the climate has changed and things are different now, is just going to lead to more of this.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a devastating year, the climate hubs, USDA\u2019s front line to help farmers, are not just flying under the radar -- they are also struggling to hold on to what little funding and staff they have.\n\nThe inaugural class of fellows, many of them post-docs, who helped launch the climate hubs has begun to move on and those workers, who make up nearly a third of the total staff, are not expected to be replaced. USDA said no decisions have been made about whether the fellows program will continue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s duct-taped together,\u201d said one current climate hub employee who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation.\n\nThe haphazard budget set-up, where agencies are expected to chip in, has only gotten more precarious as the hubs go further into an administration that seems largely indifferent to them. As another official explained it: \u201cIt was set up to be preserved because it doesn\u2019t have a line item, but it was also kind of set up to fail because it doesn\u2019t have a line item.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, two of the USDA agencies that had been supplying funds for the hub network have pulled their financial support: the Risk Management Agency and Farm Service Agency, according to documents obtained by POLITICO. Despite these challenges, USDA said the department has managed to keep the overall budget for the climate hubs largely flat \u2014 at nearly $11 million total for all ten locations \u2014 since 2015.\n\nNonetheless, other agencies have started to ask that the staff they\u2019re dedicating to the hubs do more work that\u2019s specific to the mission of their agency, not necessarily the broader mission of the climate hubs.\n\nThe Forest Service, for example, is less interested in changing on-farm practices because it\u2019s outside the scope of its work, and the Agricultural Research Service is generally more interested in publishing papers in peer-reviewed journals than it is in doing farmer outreach, something that\u2019s usually left to other parts of USDA.\n\nThe rocky political situation has left the hubs to struggle with competing priorities and an uncertain future while international authorities warn that action on climate is increasingly urgent to stave off the most dire consequences.\n\nOfficials who work on climate issues within USDA are often conflicted about whether the hubs and their resources should get more promotion in the current administration, according to more than a dozen interviews with current and former staff. On one hand, they see their work as more urgent than ever, but on the other there\u2019s a sense that ignoring the hubs may be key to their survival in a politically hostile environment.\n\n\u201cThe one saving grace is that they\u2019re so low-profile they haven\u2019t been targeted,\u201d one former hub official said.\n\nAgainst the odds, the boot-strapped climate hubs have come up with several programs and tools aimed specifically at helping farmers, ranchers and forest managers make climate-focused decisions, according to interviews and a review of their websites. And the hubs continue to use the term climate change liberally -- a rarity in the department.\n\nLast year, the Northwest Climate Hub, fresh off a particularly horrible wildfire season, contributed to a new tool called AgBizClimate built by Oregon State University. The program allows operators to plug in farm-specific information and model out economic costs and returns for their businesses under different climate scenarios.\n\n\u201cThis tool is a powerful means to summarize and help farmers understand their area\u2019s available climate information,\u201d according to a page on the Northwest Climate Hub\u2019s website. \u201cMore importantly, it shows how climate change could impact the costs and returns they are likely to face over the next twenty to thirty years.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Northern Plains Climate Hub teamed up with the University of Nebraska Lincoln to launch a new simulation tool to help farmers make farm-practice decisions based on extreme weather scenarios -- something that rolled out just months after record flooding of the Missouri River and its tributaries left countless fields either under water or too wet to plant.\n\nThe Southwest Climate Hub, which serves an area where rising temperatures are expected to hamper growing leafy greens and other sensitive specialty crops, in 2017 launched a data portal called AgRisk Viewer, which allows farmers and local officials to analyze trends in crop insurance payouts by state or county, providing an overview of what type of weather is driving losses in certain areas.\n\nSuch systems could be useful to farmers whose operations are increasingly high tech and data-driven. But most of the digital tools are so buried on USDA\u2019s network of websites that producers would likely need to know what they were looking for to find them.\n\nOne exception has been an initiative developed by the Northern Great Plains Climate Hub called Grass-Cast, which forecasts how much grass will be available for livestock in the upcoming summer. Last summer, USDA\u2019s blog touted the newly launched tool, which uses more than three decades of data to make predictions.\n\nThe decision to highlight the work of the Northern Great Plains Climate Hub shows that when USDA wants to embrace a tool, it has the capacity to do so. In most cases, it doesn\u2019t. That consigns important information that could help millions of farmers to the back reaches of the extensive web of USDA websites or the largely unseen Twitter feed of the climate hubs.\n\nIn late August, for example, the hubs account posted a report confirming that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year since the mid-1800s, while greenhouse gases and sea levels were also at record levels. The tweet got a meager one like and one retweet.\n\nNEW #StateoftheClimate report confirms 2018 was the 4th warmest year in records dating to the mid-1800's https://t.co/xnJSWIsOKT markers such as #sealevel + #ghg concentrations in the atmosphere once again broke records set just 1 year prior / @NOAAClimate #climatechange #climate pic.twitter.com/oP238rwYwi \u2014 USDA Climate Hubs (@USDAClimateHubs) August 28, 2019\n\nThe same day, the climate hubs account also posted an updated climate outlook for Midwest farmers and ranchers, with the latest weather and climate projections. The report illustrated how average temperatures are increasing in most parts of the country and warned that there is going to be more rain, more potential for soil and nutrient loss, and increased need for drainage across the region.\n\nThat tweet was retweeted only twice.\n\nUSDA defended its marketing of adaptation resources, noting that they can be found on the climate hubs\u2019 central website. Each regional hub also holds local workshops and publishes peer-reviewed studies about the effects of climate change, the department said.\n\nBut during the current administration, USDA\u2019s twitter account has not retweeted a single post from the hubs, like it routinely does for other parts of the department. Nor has it ever shared any of the climate hubs \u2019 regional vulnerability assessments or tools aimed at helping farmers adapt to climate change.\n\nThe stealth-mode of the climate hubs is also apparent in the resources USDA provides for farmers and ranchers.\n\nA new online platform called farmers.gov, lauded by Secretary Perdue as a one-stop shop for producers, for example, doesn\u2019t direct producers to the climate hubs or share any of the tools that have been developed by the hubs.\n\nAs in previous administrations, USDA continues to urge farmers and ranchers to focus on soil health, but the department has since abandoned a broad \u201cClimate Smart\u201d effort it launched under the Obama administration in 2015. That plan was aimed at reducing agriculture\u2019s net emissions and sequestering more than 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2025.\n\n\u201cThis reduction is equivalent of taking 25 million cars off the road or offsetting the emissions produced by powering nearly 11 million homes per year,\u201d USDA said at the time.\n\nThat claim that has since been scrubbed from USDA\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIn this administration, it\u2019s really tough to talk about climate change, but you start talking about soil health -- that seems to be palatable. It is a problem though,\u201d said Fred Yoder, an Ohio farmer growing corn and soybeans, who used to lead the National Corn Growers Association and is a vocal advocate for no-till, cover crops and other adaptation practices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a crying shame that we\u2019ve politicized climate change,\u201d Yoder said. \u201cIt\u2019s science. Science isn\u2019t perfect. But it\u2019s the very best tool we have. And the science is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re dancing around the administration\u2019s reluctance to call it what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely perfect time to talk about how to adapt.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhile USDA keeps its work on climate change under the radar, the scene in Rock Port looks almost apocalyptic.\n\nLeaving Oswald\u2019s farm, there are bare fields and washed out roads as far as one can see. In some places, fertile soil has washed away and headed down stream, leaving cracks in the fields. Multiple nearby exits off I-29 \u2014 the interstate that extends from the Canadian border down to Kansas City \u2014 remain closed.\n\nOff in the distance, there\u2019s a lava-like inferno. The glowing sliver of red and orange is a massive pile of soybeans that\u2019s been burning, on and off, for weeks.\n\nWhen the beans first began to burn, folks in town were confused, Oswald said. \u201cThe local reaction was: \u2018What the hell? What\u2019s burning?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt turns out when soybeans get wet, the oil starts to separate from the rest of the bean. As the damp beans heat up under the sun, the warm, decomposing mixture of organic matter and oil can spontaneously combust.\n\nIt smells like \u201ca cross between hot brakes and burning rubber,\u201d Oswald said.\n\nOswald doesn\u2019t like seeing the house his father built look like this, scattered with debris, water-stained walls surrounded by weeds, and he grows more somber thinking about what his parents would think.\n\n\u201cI look at the heavens once in a while and think my folks can\u2019t be too happy about it,\u201d he says.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0f/eb/ba3bc5464b36b80ae0cc75f3068d/20190906msmag-climate-oswald042-nik-1-nik-nik-dxo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
