The Tongans, led by big-hitting loose forwards Sione Kalamafoni and Zane Kapeli, however, proved difficult to break down and it was only rampaging centre Tuilagi's tries that gave England an 18-3 advantage at half-time.\n\nHooker Jamie George and his replacement Luke Cowan-Dickie added second-half tries for the 2003 champions, who controlled territory and possession and had a smart tactical kicking game but could not finish off the numerous chances they created.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Full-time: England 35-3 Tonga 80 mins: Back-to-back penalties for Tonga sees Morath find touch on the edge of the England 22. They've got a chance... 80 mins: The final gong sounds out to signal the end of the match, but Tonga have a scrum and the fans are urging them on to try and muster something special up to finish. 77 mins: Joseph breaks through the middle of the park and is one-on-one with Halaifonua, with some lazy defending in the line to blame. Joseph sticks the full-back before delivering a well-timed pass for Luke Cowan-Dickie to go over for the fourth try of the evening. Farrell converts. 35-3 Advertisement 77 mins: TRY FOR ENGLAND! 73 mins: This game really is shuddering to a conclusion, and a number of fans have decided that they've seen enough and are flooding out - that could well be that they were here yesterday and got caught up in the long delays post-match. However, England finally come to life when Watson goes on a mazy run from his own 22 to the Tongan 22, breaking tackle after tackle to delight those still here. He offloads to Tuilagi, and the ball is recycled and spread wide quickly Farrell throws it long to Joseph tho shows quick hands to get it to Slade, but the full-back tries a no-look pass to Daly and only succeeds in passing the ball into touch. The try line was at his mercy there, and that was just a bit rubbish from there pair. 68 mins: Ludlam does well to turn the ball over and Kruis picks it up before booting it down-field for Daly to chase. It just evades him as the ball trickles into touch before he can reach it, and England make a notable substitution as Ford heads off with Jonathan Joseph on, meaning Farrell will switch to 10. I'd take that as confirmation that Ford is in line to play on Thursday in some capacity. 67 mins: Interestingly, Ludlam is at seven and Curry is remaining on the blindside, with Jones happy to keep the Sale man on his unfavoured side of the scrum. Advertisement 65 mins: England knock the ball on in possession and then compound the error by conceding a penalty in the scrum, allowing Morath to send a beauty to touch on the five-metre line. Tonga finally get the lineout right, though Kruis comes mighty close to stealing it, but despite chucking everything into the maul, it comes to nothing as England hold the ball up and get the put-in. 61 mins: Plenty of changes now, with George and Sinckler also heading off for Luke Cowan-Dickie and Dan Cole, while Tonga send on Siua Maile, Nasi Manu and Leon Fukofuka wor Sakalia, Tameifuna and Vaipulu. 57 mins: Well that was emphatic. England set-up the rolling maul and boy is it rolling. The pack charge over the line before the backs can even get there to join them, and its Jamie George who emerges with the ball from the bottom of the pile. Farrell converts the kick and England are cruising now. 28-3 57 mins: TRY FOR ENGLAND! Advertisement 55 mins: Another replacement for England as Lewis Ludlam comes on for his World Cup debut, replacing Sam Underhill in the back row. You'd imagine that Curry will move to openside now and Ludlam will fill the blindside of the scrum, while that also suggests that Underhill could be in action once again on Thursday. George Kruis and Willi Heinz also come on for Lawes and Youngs, and England have a penalty for offside that Farrell puts into the corner. 52 mins: Piutau gets a chance to stretch his legs and does well to dummy his way past Tuilagi. However, his offload isn't collected by Vuna and England win the ball. Ford chips ahead for one for himself to chase and he does well to tackle Takulua deep in the corner, and as England flood into the ruck they win possession five metres out. Youngs takes the ball to feed Underhill, only for the flanker to drop it much to the frustration of fans. This will be a worry for England though. Jonny May is going off, and Henry Slade is on at full-back - not his natural position by any stretch - with Daly moving to the wing. 50 mins: The colossus that is Ben Tameifuna takes into contact against Farrell and Ford - that's still not really a fair match-up given the size of the prop - but Underhill is in close company and he manages to get over the ball and win the penalty for not releasing. Farrell kicks to touch, and England send Ellis Genge on for Joe Marler. It'll be worth keeping an eye on who comes off with a nod to whether they'll be involved against the USA on Thursday. 48 mins: May and Underhill hit Tuitavake, who is on for Atieli Pakalani on the right wing, with a double hit before George then takes down Fisi'ihoi. The hooker just limps away from the contact, with an issue to his ankle it seems, but it looks like he'll try to run it off. Advertisement 46 mins: England are looking to bring Tuilagi into the game at every opportunity possible, with Farrell throwing a flat pass that was well disguised which nearly results in him breaking free. However, the ball is knocked forwards to give Tonga possession in the form of a scrum. 43 mins: Farrell landed his third penalty of the evening to increase the lead further. 21-3 41 mins: England get themselves a quick penalty as Vaipulu comes around the side of the ruck, following another barn-storming run from Tuilagi. Farrell will kick for goal. 41 mins: England kick off and the second half is underway!
