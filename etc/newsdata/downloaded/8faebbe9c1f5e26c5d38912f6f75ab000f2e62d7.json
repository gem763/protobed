The Outlook is Positive. The debt securities are issued by Mong Duong Finance Holdings B.V., a Netherlands-domiciled SPV that acquires all of AES - VCM's outstanding project financing loans. Principal and interest payments for the US dollar notes rely on payments made by AES - VCM to the offshore SPV under the project financing loans. The final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received and is in line with the expected rating assigned on 18 July 2019. RATING RATIONALE AES - VCM benefits from a favourable 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with state-owned Vietnam Electricity (EVN, BB/Positive) until 2040. The PPA provides for capacity and energy payments to cover the fixed and variable costs of company's plant - Mong Duong 2 (MD2) - subject to a minimum performance level. A coal-supply agreement (CSA) is signed with state-owned Vinacomin at a price regulated by the Vietnamese government, which covers the entire project life. The MD2 project also benefits from a government guarantee on all payment obligations and financial commitments of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreement for the entire project life. The government guarantee also covers the obligations of EVN under the PPA and Vinacomin under the CSA for 18 years from the commercial operation date. The notes' rating is capped at 'BB'/Positive by Vietnam's sovereign rating (BB/Positive) due to the government guarantee of Vietnamese state counterparty obligations. The underlyingcredit rating is 'bbb-'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Long-Term PPA: Revenue Risk - Stronger MD2's revenue stream under the PPA includes capacity payments that are intended to cover debt service, fixed operating costs and provide a return on equity. The PPA also includes energy payments to cover variable costs, including fuel and variable operating costs. However, full fuel-cost pass-through is dependent on meeting the contracted heat rate. MD2 has no exposure to merchant power-price risk. The PPA foresees pass-through of costs associated with changes in environmental legislation or permits to EVN. We regard the termination provisions as mostly in line with these types of power projects. Fixed-capacity charges are indexed to the US dollar, providing protection against foreign-exchange fluctuation; a portion of operating expense payments is in Vietnamese dong to cover costs in local currency. EVN's performance and financial obligations under the PPA are covered by the government guarantee until 2033. Self-Operated; Experienced Sponsors: Operation Risk - Midrange MD2 uses conventional commercially proven technology and has an operating history of four years. The project is self-operated and shareholders provide technical consulting services through a cost-plus technical services agreement. MD2 has maintained its availability above the contracted level. The project is liable to a capacity damages charge if outages energy is greater than the allowance. The allowed outages energy is calculated annually. This means that a forced outage in one month could be compensated by higher availability in the next month. MD2 is also allowed to carry up to 160GWh of allowed outages energy from one year to another if it remains unutilised. The plant has had heat rates higher than contracted. Management has implemented measures to tackle the problem, and heat rates improved to be more in line with PPA requirement in 2018 and 2019. However, a longer record is needed to confirm that the improvement is sustainable. The company does not anticipate a heat-rate deviation relative to the PPA in its projection. Fitch's rating case forecasts a 2% underperformance relative to the PPA. The plant is protected against low-load dispatch, as the heat rate is adjusted to dispatch level. Fitch's operation risk assessment is constrained to 'Midrange' due to heat-rate underperformance, the self-operated contractual structure and limited technical advisor input in the rating process. Fuel Supply Risk Passed-Through: Supply Risk - Midrange MD2 has a coal-supply agreement with state-owned Vinacomin until 2040, in line with the PPA, at a coal price regulated by the government but no higher than that charged to other EVN power plants. There are several coal mines close to the power plant and we expect that the coal will be supplied by those coal mines during the entire project life. Vinacomin's payment obligations and financial commitments are covered by a government guarantee until 2033. The BOT contract protects the project against interruption in coal supplies, other than that caused by AES - VCM. The company will still receive capacity charges from the MOIT if Vinacomin fails to supply the coal and the plant cannot generate electricity AES - VCM also has the right to buy coal from a different supplier. Vinacomin is obligated to cover any difference if the cost of coal between the alternative source and Vinacomin is less than 3%. However, it is unlikely that AES - VCM will be able to buy coal in the market with only a 3% increase in cost, since Vinacomin is Vietnam's largest coal producer and the cost would be at market prices, not the government-regulated price. Non-Standard Structure/Security Package: Debt Structure - Midrange The offshore SPV issued a four-year floating-rate loan, which is swapped into a fixed-rate loan, and 10-year senior secured fixed-rate notes. The SPV uses the proceeds to purchase the existing BOT loan for around USD1.1 billion. The new debt, which has the same quantum and amortisation profile as the BOT loan, will be serviced by BOT-loan debt-service payments. The security package of the original financing is available to the new lenders, but indirectly through the loan provided by the offshore SPV to AES - VCM. The new lenders will also benefit from a pledge of shares in the SPV and security over the SPV's assets. The transaction's structure is not standard due to a lack of a direct relationship between the offshore SPV and AES - VCM, either through shareholding of the offshore SPV or a guarantee from AES - VCM. The debt is fully amortising and ranks pari passu. The amortisation will be sequential among the two tranches; the 10-year bond will start amortising when the four-year loan is fully amortised in 2023. Covenants include limitations on indebtedness, business activities and asset disposals. The debt also benefits from a backward-looking distribution lockup at a 1.15x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR). A debt service reserve letter of credit will be maintained at the amount of debt service in the next six months. A maintenance reserve account will prefund major overhaul capex over the next six years. PEER GROUP The notes issued under Minejesa Capital BV, which are guaranteed by PT Paiton Energy, are rated 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. Paiton is the second-largest independent power producer in Indonesia's eastern Java and the rating applies to three units of the plant, one of which (Unit 3) is also using super-critical pulverised coal technology. The project is fully contracted under a long-term PPA, with fuel costs effectively passed through, and is run by a sponsor-owned operator. Paiton's debt structure is typical of project finance transactions, featuring a fully amortising, six-month debt service reserve account, 12-month major maintenance reserve account and a distribution lock-up covenant of 1.2x DSCR. MD2 has a non-standard structure and security package, but benefits from a six-month debt service reserve letter of credit and a 1.15x lock-up covenant. Paiton benefits from a longer operating history. Paiton has an average profile DSCR of 1.45x and a minimum of 1.18x in Fitch's rating case. The notes issued under LLPL Capital Pte. Ltd., which are guaranteed by Indonesia-based PT Lestari Banten Energi (LBE), are rated 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. LBE operates a 635MW super-critical coal-fired power plant in west Java. Similarly to MD2, the project has a favourable long-term PPA with the state-owned electricity supplier, which provides capacity payments and a pass-through element to cover operating costs. Both projects have cost-plus operation and maintenance structure. LBE benefits from input from US-based Black Veatch, which allows us to apply lower stress in our rating case. LBE's debt is fully amortising with a six-month debt service reserve account and a distribution lockup at 1.20x DSCR, which is slightly stronger than that of MD2. LBE has an average profile DSCR of 1.44x and a minimum of 1.28x in Fitch's rating case. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: - Upgrade of the sovereign rating of Vietnam to 'BB+' with no deterioration in the underlying credit rating Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: - Downgrade of the sovereign rating of Vietnam to 'BB-' - Operational difficulties or other developments that result in the projected annual DSCR dropping below 1.20x in Fitch's rating case TRANSACTION SUMMARY The transaction is an issuance of US dollar senior secured notes due 2029. The offshore SPV uses the proceeds to acquire the original project-financing loans of AES - VCM. The transaction is to refinance the project financing loans at a lower interest rate. MD2 is a 2x560MW (net capacity: 1,120MW) sub-critical coal-fired power plant located 220km east of Hanoi, in northern Vietnam's Quang Ning province. The plant is one of the first independent power producers in Vietnam and is operating under a 25-year BOT agreement between AES Mong Duong Holdings B.V. and the MOIT until 2040. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS The key assumptions underpinning Fitch's base and rating cases under our Thermal Power Project Rating Criteria refer to availability, dispatch, heat rate, operating and capital costs, and cost indexation. The rating case incorporates a combination of operational and economic stresses that simulates a scenario of material underperformance, with the stresses based on Fitch's experience, peer comparison, and the opinions expressed by the technical advisor. The Fitch base case uses MD2 management's projections for availability factors, dispatch factors, coal costs, routine operating expenses and scheduled maintenance costs. We forecast the heat rate to be 0.5% above the PPA's target. The Fitch base case also reflects our macroeconomic assumptions for US CPI, Vietnam CPI and exchange rates. The Fitch rating case applies further stresses to the Fitch base case, including stresses on outage durations (1pp increase to annual forced outages duration and 10% stress to planned outage durations), and a heat rate 2% above the PPA's target to reflect historical underperformance of the plant. Fitch stresses the operating costs and capital expenditure by 15% following guidance in the Thermal Power Projects Rating Criteria. Fitch focuses on the minimum and average annual DSCR in light of the fully amortising debt and the limited term of the PPA, which terminates in 2040. The average annual DSCR under Fitch's base casefor the 10-year senior secured notes is 1.49x, with a minimum of 1.43x. The average annual DSCR under Fitch's rating case for the notes is 1.41x, with a minimum of 1.32x. Public Ratings with Credit Linkage to Other Ratings The notes' rating is capped at 'BB'/Positive by Vietnam's sovereign rating (BB/Positive) due to the government guarantee of Vietnamese state counterparty obligations.
