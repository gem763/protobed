Aside from creating a custom belt for the occasion, there\u2019s the N.W.A. \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d-themed poster and \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d-inspired video promos. Although I\u2019ve already expanded on my thoughts about the UFC\u2019s crossover into Quentin Tarantino\u2019s universe, I thought it might be fun to focus on the \u201cgangster\u201d element of Diaz\u2019s callout, ranking my favorite gangster moments from their careers.\n\nWithout further ado \u2026\n\n****\n\n10. \u2018I don\u2019t know what kind of f*cking show this is, man\u2019\n\nDiaz has to be at the top of the proverbial mountain with Derrick Lewis when it comes to post-fight interviews, but his in-octagon interview with Jon Anik after topping Gray Maynard in 2013 is still my favorite from Stockton\u2019s finest.\n\nDiaz starts off the interview with a quote that I saw fit to lead this pick off, opting to ignore Anik\u2019s initial question by voicing almost aimless displeasures with the production to start off his victory lap. Then, in typical Nate fashion, Diaz starts in on his usual laundry list of shoutouts, listing off every name from Ronda Rousey to Chis Avila.\n\nIn fact, as someone who was in attendance, Rousey and a huge Diaz contingent were uncharacteristically allowed to form cageside while the younger Diaz brother went on to hold court, proclaiming Gilbert Melendez and himself as the best lightweights in the division (doing everything but sparking a joint up to celebrate). And when Anik asked if he could quickly take us through the finish, Diaz plainly replied, \u201cI won. That\u2019s what\u2019s up,\u201d as he closed with, \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I got sh*t to do.\u201d\n\nIt was a pretty gangster moment, if you ask me, but it was also a precursor of post-fight moments to come.\n\nCheck it out:", "description": "Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz are appropriately fighting for the \"BMF\" title at UFC 244, as proven by this list.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/jorge-masvidal-nate-diaz-ufc-244-poster.jpg?w=1000&h=546&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
