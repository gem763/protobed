The firm says it could be ethereum\u2019s \u201cbest shot\u201d to beat other smart contract platforms.\n\nThe investment consists of a $10 million contribution from SKALE Labs and $7 million in a recent financing, SKALE Labs CEO Jack O\u2019Holleran told CoinDesk, noting the numbers are not final due to ongoing accounting adjustments and asset transfers.\n\nNineteen investors participated in the recent financing, including Arrington XRP Capital, Blockchange, ConsenSys Labs, Hashed, HashKey, Multicoin Capital, Recruit Holdings and Winklevoss Capital, bringing the total number of backers of the project to over 40, according to O\u2019Holleran.\n\nThe contribution from the San Francisco-based SKALE Labs largely comes from its previous financing through a $10 million Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale including an $8.68 million funding round led by Multicoin Capital and $785,000 from earlier investors last year\n\n\u201cSkale has grown tremendously over the past year in almost every aspect,\u201d Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk via email, adding:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to like, and we\u2019ve been impressed by their ability to set strategy, design spec, and execute. The product is also clearly hitting a nerve. I expect a majority of the smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem to eventually leverage Skale.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be used to seed and stabilize SKALE\u2019s proof-of-stake network and increase its security, as well as adding more people to the 20-person engineering team, O\u2019Holleran said.\n\nAfter a token sale last October, SKALE Labs launched a testnet in late-2018 and established the NODE Foundation in April 2019. NODE is similar to the non-profit Ethereum Foundation in that both organizations promote the use of their respective networks.\n\nSmart-contract competition\n\nSKALE is the latest attempt at boosting the scalability of the ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe network says it will enable dapps to conduct \u201cmillions of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of what\u2019s possible today,\u201d according to a statement from SKALE Labs.\n\nO\u2019Holleran added in a statement:\n\n\u201cHelping Ethereum Dapp developers scale applications is the center of what we do.\u201d\n\nThe network aims to help the developers by providing a Layer 2 platform with high speeds, fast finality and low costs, SKALE Labs said.\n\nGaming and decentralize finance (DeFi) applications are where SKALE hopes to move the needle, O\u2019Holleran said.\n\n\u201cA lot of games not only want to have a blockchain to support payments within the system but also have NFTs [non-fungible tokens], the part of the game that lives on the blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nBlockchain investors of late have seemed to be bullish on the gaming use-case.\n\nIn September, South African firm Naspers Ventures led a $15 million Series A funding round in Immutable Games, the maker of Gods Unchained.\n\nTwo months earlier, Initialized Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital invested $3.75 million in Horizon Games, a blockchain-based game studio with a Hearthstone competitor called Skyweaver.\n\nO\u2019Holleran said SKALE currently has 23 different dapps on the platform. The full list of gaming companies that partner with SKALE will be released at the beginning of November, he said.\n\nHashed, as one of the network\u2019s major investors, was chosen for its strategic value in the South Korean gaming market, O\u2019Holleran said, adding:\n\n\u201cI think the [Korean] market is really adopting compared to the rest of the world. I think it is going to be the first place we see significant traction.\u201d\n\nEthereum and USD image via Shutterstock", "description": "Ethereum Scaling Network SKALE raises $17.1 million to launch its mainnet to help Etherrum beat other smart contract platforms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ether.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
