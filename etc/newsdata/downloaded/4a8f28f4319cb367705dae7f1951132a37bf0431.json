The attacks on Saudi Arabia early Saturday morning, cutting its oil production in half, have us on the brink of a huge new Middle East conflict, a massive surge in oil prices, and a global recession.\n\nThe administration is blaming Iran, and may well be right about that. It\u2019s highly unlikely that Houthi rebels in Yemen, who claimed responsibility for lighting up the sky with Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important petroleum processing plant, had the means on their own to carry out such an operation.", "description": "An attack on Saudi oil facilities threatens the global economy and practically dares the U.S. to retaliate.
