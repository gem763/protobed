The quarterbacks have traded places since then, with Cousins signing a three-year, $84 million deal with Minnesota before last season and Keenum coming to Washington in March via a trade with the Broncos after one mediocre season in Denver.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCousins, who led the largest comeback in Redskins history, shouted \u201cYou like that!,\" set a bunch of single-season franchise passing records and led Washington to one playoff appearance in three years as the full-time starter, is off to a hot start for the 5-2 Vikings.

Keenum, who threw for only 77 yards on 12 attempts in Washington\u2019s 9-0 loss to the 49ers last week, will be without running back Chris Thompson and tight end Vernon Davis once again.\n\nRedskins running back Adrian Peterson is questionable with an ankle injury, but intends to play against his former team. The 34-year-old has benefited from interim Coach Bill Callahan\u2019s commitment to the run over the last two weeks, with 199 yards on 43 carries after rushing for only 108 yards in his first four games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCase Keenum and Kirk Cousins set to face off in Redskins-Vikings QB reunion game.

The Vikings have play-action on 35.7 percent of Cousins\u2019s dropbacks, second in the NFL to the Colts\u2019 Jacoby Brissett.
