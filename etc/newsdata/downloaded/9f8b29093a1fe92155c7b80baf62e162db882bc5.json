The Braves went on to win 3-1, taking their second of three possible victories in the four-game set. Keuchel now has a 0.97 ERA across 37 innings spanning his last six starts. Overall, he\u2019s sporting a 3.35 ERA since joining the Braves.\n\nThe Braves, you may recall, signed Keuchel to a one-year, $21.21 million deal on June 7. Because of the general stagnation of the free agent market plus the draft pick compensation that was attached to him, Keuchel remained unsigned through the offseason, through spring training, and through the first two months of the season before ultimately signing with the Braves.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Phillies were among the 29 other teams that passed on Keuchel. After Zach Eflin\u2018s abbreviated start on Wednesday, the club has an aggregate rotation ERA of 4.56. One wonders if the Phillies might be leading the NL Wild Card or perhaps even the NL East if they had forked over the cash to bring in Keuchel ahead of the start of the regular season. 25 starts and roughly 175 innings of 3.35 ERA ball \u2014 or even 3.50-3.75 \u2014 sure would have been nice.\n\nKeuchel was asked after the game if he had any extra motivation because he was spurned by the Phillies as a free agent. He responded, via Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia, \u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t come calling, what is there for me to be mad about? I think a lot of those guys over there in the front office are second-guessing themselves, and, I mean, I would too.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen told of Keuchel\u2019s comment, Phillies outfielder Bryce Harper \u2014 who signed a then-record 13-year, $330 million contract in February \u2014 was in agreement with the lefty. Harper said, \u201cHe\u2019s a Cy Young winner for a reason. If you have an opportunity to go out and get a guy like that, I think all 29 teams should have that. But that\u2019s how the game is right now and that\u2019s how it goes.\u201d\n\nWhile both players have a point that teams aren\u2019t spending on free agents the way they used to, pointing a finger at the Phillies isn\u2019t exactly the best way to make that point. Not only did the Phillies pledge nearly one-third of a billion dollars to Harper, they also signed Andrew McCutchen (three years, $50 million) and David Robertson (two years, $23 million) while trading for J.T. Realmuto and Jean Segura. After a plethora of injuries and Od\u00fabel Herrera\u2019s suspension left the team short-handed, the Phillies brought in Jay Bruce (who also got hurt) and Corey Dickerson, as well as Jason Vargas and Drew Smyly. Could the Phillies have afforded $20-25 million more per year for Keuchel on a multi-year deal? Certainly. But it\u2019s more productive to point fingers at teams that truly aren\u2019t spending money rather than the teams like the Phillies that have been relatively liberal with opening up the checkbook.", "description": "After pitching six terrific innings against the Phillies on Wednesday night, Braves starter Dallas Keuchel called up the Phillies' front office for not signing him as a free agent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VB5W37KZCP4T_YqnebOj6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/imRtJwTNiwXnySV1b56YGA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/c18253615542c43f8e47fecb5b93a09c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
