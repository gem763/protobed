From spectacular evening gowns to more ordinary day dresses worn in the newsreels of the time, the royal outfits created for the drama have echoed the real thing.\n\nThere was also room for some \u201cartistic licence\u201d, says Jane Petrie, who designed the costumes for season two. For example, Vanessa Kirby\u2019s Princess Margaret, in modish black outfits, signalled the arrival of the swinging \u201860s and the bohemian milieu of London\u2019s Soho.\n\n\u201cEverything is controlled,\u201d says Petrie of the real-life Royals\u2019 attire. \u201cAnd it\u2019s quite theatrical. In the way that what we do is theatrical as well.\u201d\n\nClick play on the video above to find out more.\n\nThe Crown series three drops on 17 November 2019 on Netflix.\n\nLove TV?
