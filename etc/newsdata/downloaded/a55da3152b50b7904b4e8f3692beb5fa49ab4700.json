She walked off the weather set and its green screen and into the news set, where the clown followed her. \"Good Morning Arizona\" anchor Javier Soto seemed to find it particularly funny.\n\n\u201cJavier, is this you?\u201d Warnecke said as she walked off. For the rest of the clown\u2019s stay, Warnecke kept her back to him, never looking at him. Soto hugged the clown, who bore a box of Hurts doughnuts. Co-anchor Olivia Fierro recorded it all on her smartphone.\n\n.@aprilwarnecke had a surprise guest during Good Morning, Arizona...a SCARY DONUT CLOWN!\n\n\n\nLet's just say she didn't enjoy it as much as @JavierSotoTV \ud83e\udd23\ud83c\udf69\ud83e\udd21 pic.twitter.com/l2l0aBTX3R \u2014 azfamily 3TV CBS 5 (@azfamily) October 7, 2019\n\nUnexpected guest: Escaped goat breaks into Ohio home through glass door, takes nap in bathroom\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of clowns in general,\u201d Warnecke said in an email Tuesday. \u201cJust scary clowns. Really \u2013 just anything scary. And who wants anything or anybody jumping at you during a live broadcast?! It\u2019s pretty jarring.\u201d\n\nAnd pretty funny, too.\n\n\"I've also had haunted house characters, Mrs. Claus and several comedians surprise me live on the green screen over the past 14 years at KVTK,\" Warnecke said.\n\nSomeday maybe she'll get used to it. But Monday was definitely not that day.\n\nFollow Bill Goodykoontz on Twitter: @goodyk\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/clown-scares-april-warnecke-meteorologist-good-morning-arizona/3920848002/", "description": "Who doesn\u2019t like doughnuts?
