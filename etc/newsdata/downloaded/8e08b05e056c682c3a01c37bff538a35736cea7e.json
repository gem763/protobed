REUTERS/Thomas White\n\nThe pioneer of the package holiday agreed key terms of a 900 million pound recapitalization plan last month with Chinese shareholder Fosun (1992.HK) and the travel firm\u2019s banks, significantly diluting existing shareholders.\n\nBut the firm released a statement on Friday saying a last-minute demand for additional funding puts that deal at risk.\n\nThomas Cook employs 21,000 staff and has 600,000 customers currently on holiday, mostly from Germany, Britain and Scandinavia.\n\nA source familiar with the negotiations said the company had \u201ca matter of days\u201d to find a solution. Shares in the company hit a record low of 2 pence following the statement, down 15 percent on the day.\n\nLenders are demanding another 200 million pounds in underwritten funds to support Thomas Cook through its winter trading period, when cash is usually running low.\n\n\u201cDiscussions to agree final terms on the recapitalization and reorganization of the company are continuing,\u201d Thomas Cook said.\n\n\u201cThese discussions include a recent request for a seasonal standby facility of 200 million pounds, on top of the previously announced 900 million pounds injection of new capital.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook said the recapitalization posed \u201ca significant risk of no recovery\u201d for the diluted shareholders.\n\nThomas Cook has struggled with competition in popular destinations, high debt levels and an unusually hot summer in 2018 which reduced last-minute bookings.\n\nThe firm has 1.7 billion pounds of debt.\n\nLatest Credit Default Swap (CDS) pricing indicates an implied probability of default on Thomas Cook of 100%, data from IHS Markit showed, and a decision on whether investors who used the instrument to bet against the company are due a payout has been delayed until at least Monday.\n\nA source close to the discussions said on Thursday that Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (RBS.L) had hit Thomas Cook with a last minute demand for the extra funding, adding that the situation \u201cwas becoming more critical\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for RBS said the bank did not \u201crecognize this characterization of events\u201d and was working with all parties to \u201ctry and find a resolution to the funding and liquidity shortfall at Thomas Cook\u201d.\n\nUnder original terms of the plan, Fosun - whose Chinese parent owns all-inclusive holiday firm Club Med - would contribute 450 million pounds ($552 million) of new money in return for at least 75% of the tour operator business and 25% of the group\u2019s airline.\n\n\u201cOur proposed contribution of \u00a3450m has not changed throughout this process,\u201d a spokesman for Fosun Tourism Group said.\n\n\u201cAs a minority investor in Thomas Cook Group plc, and with no Board representation, we are still working tirelessly with a large number of other stakeholders and interested parties to find agreement on the Company\u2019s proposed recapitalization plan.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s lending banks and bondholders were to stump up a further 450 million pounds under the plan and convert their existing debt to equity, giving them in total about 75% of the airline and up to 25% in the tour operator business, the group said.\n\n(Graphic: Thomas Cook shares, here)\n\nGET A GRIP\n\nIf that deal is not finalised before a creditor vote on Sept. 27, then holidaymakers could be facing the second major collapse of a tour operator in as many years, after the failure of Monarch in 2017.\n\nWhen Monarch collapsed, the British government repatriated all customers abroad, both those with package holiday protection from Air Travel Organisers\u2019 Licensing (ATOL) and flight-only passengers who were not protected.\n\nIf Britain does the same for Thomas Cook\u2019s customers, then 160,000 Britons would need repatriation, eclipsing the number brought home after Monarch\u2019s collapse. A source familiar with the matter said that Britain\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was making contingency plans and the bill for the government could reach 600 million pounds.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport declined to say if there were plans for a repatriation effort. Asked about Thomas Cook, he said: \u201cWe do not speculate on the financial situation of individual businesses.\u201d\n\nBritish pilot union BALPA, whose members have previously gone on strike in a disagreement over pay with Thomas Cook\u2019s management, have supported the restructuring and urged the banks and government to support the travel group.\n\n\u201cIf Thomas Cook goes into administration it will cost the taxpayer as much to repatriate holidaymakers as it would cost to save Thomas Cook,\u201d General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe government sat on the sidelines wringing its hands when Monarch Airlines was let down by its financiers, this time government needs to get a grip and do its bit to save Thomas Cook.\u201d\n\n(Graphic: Thomas Cook CDS, here)", "description": "Britain's Thomas Cook urgently needs 200 million pounds ($251 million) to satisfy its lenders or one of the world's oldest holiday company's could collapse in the next few days, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers stranded.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431966608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0ZC", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
