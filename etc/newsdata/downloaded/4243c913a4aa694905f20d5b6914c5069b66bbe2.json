As such, we now find the bulk of the near-term trends for the major equity indices in neutral with only the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 positive.\n\nSource: Worden\n\nThis current state of the near-term trends is similar to our concerns noted last week regarding the cumulative advance/decline line for the Nasdaq making a notably lower high during the recent rally, both of which suggest a weakening technical foundation, in our opinion.\n\nThe stochastic levels are overbought on all of the indices but have not yet yielded \"bearish crossover\" signals.\n\nThe cumulative advance/decline lines are positive on the All Exchange NYSE and Nasdaq while high \"volume at price\" (VAP) levels are generally supportive.\n\nData\n\nThe data remains mostly neutral including all of the one-day McClellan Overbought/Oversold Oscillators (All Exchange:+28.54 NYSE:+24.56 Nasdaq:+33.73).\n\nThe detrended Rydex Ratio (contrary indicator) is bullish at -1.77 suggesting a more cautious crowd outlook.\n\nLast week's AAII Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicators) also turned bullish at 38.67/23.33, echoing the Rydex data. However, the Investor's Intelligence Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicator) remained bearish at 17.2/47.6, suggesting an excess of bullish sentiment on the part of investment advisors continues.\n\nThe percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages is a neutral 61.6%. as is the Open Insider Buy/Sell Ratio at 50.5.\n\nValuation\n\nValuation seems appealing, but a bit less so, with 12-month earnings estimates for the S&P 500 slipping again to $173.27 per share, via Bloomberg, leaving the forward P/E multiple at 17.2x while the \"rule of twenty\" finds fair value at 18.3x. S&P estimates have been shrinking daily over the past several sessions.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield stands at 1.75%.\n\nThe earnings yield is 5.8%.\n\nOur Outlook\n\nWe have yet to see enough of a shift on the charts and data to alter our near term \"neutral\" outlook for the major equity indices.", "description": "The Nasdaq's Near-Term Trend Has Shifted", "authors": ["Guy Ortmann", "The Nasdaq'S Near-Term Trend Has Shifted", "One Significant Technical Event That Happened Friday.", "Bret Jensen", "Bob Lang", "Bruce Kamich", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass", "Jim Cramer", "Jim"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/5e96574c-4710-11e8-a89a-519d9ccbe743.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
