The White House memo of the call and Trump's own comments about the situation have already confirmed the key details of the complaint, that Trump wielded the power of his office for political gain.\n\nRead more: The notes on Trump's call with Ukraine's president hint at a quid pro quo over investigating Joe Biden's son\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about [Biden's] son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\" he told Zelensky.\n\nNow, well over half of the House of the Representatives support the ongoing impeachment inquiry, with just a handful of House Democrats holding out.\n\nBut it doesn't mean that all those members will be guaranteed to vote for articles of impeachment if and when articles of impeachment come to the House floor. If a simple majority of members of the House voted to pass articles of impeachment, the US Senate would then hold a trial to convict or acquit Trump based on those charges.\n\nThere are multiple house committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, and House leadership is still determining whether to keep the scope of the inquiry solely focused on Trump's alleged conduct with Ukraine, or include articles related to the instances of possible obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report.\n\nRead more: An overwhelming majority of Democrats think the House should impeach Trump. So do 15% of Republicans.\n\nMany members from highly competitive districts that Trump won in 2016 only spoke out in favor of an impeachment inquiry after the substance of the whistleblower complaint came to light.\n\nMeanwhile, the House pursuing an impeachment inquiry is gaining popularity among the American public.\n\nNew polling from Morning Consult released Thursday found that support for impeachment among all Americans increased by nine percentage points and doubled among Republicans (with a margin of error of 2%) over the course of just four days as more information about the Ukraine scandal became public.\n\nRead more:\n\nPOLL: Americans support the impeachment inquiry into Trump, but they worry about electoral blowback\n\nThe whistleblower who filed an explosive complaint against Trump is reportedly a CIA officer once assigned to the White House\n\nHere are all the documents that lay out the allegations in the Trump-Ukraine scandal", "description": "Currently, almost the entire House Democratic caucus and one Independent are publicly supporting the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "authors": ["Shayanne Gal", "Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cc31016b14bf47ac9367742?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
