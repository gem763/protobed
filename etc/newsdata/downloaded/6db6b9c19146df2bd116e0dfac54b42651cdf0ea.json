Turn that couple into a throuple, and it\u2019s almost too much to handle. Case in point? Charlize Theron says she\u2019s in a \u201cnew relationship\u201d with Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie. And no one can deny the three have been spending a lot of time together \u2014 on set, that is.\n\nThere are all different types of relationships, and this one is a combination of platonic and professional. The women co-star in the upcoming film Bombshell, which explores Fox News and the story of the women who brought down the man behind the media network. Theron stars as anchor Megyn Kelly, Kidman as former Fox & Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson and Robbie as fictional Fox News associate producer Kayla Pospisil.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nClearly, working together to tell such an important story forged a strong bond between the women. On Saturday, Theron posted a stunning photo of the three embracing each other and smiling into the camera. \u201cI feel like I have to be honest. I\u2019m in a new relationship. With both these ladies,\u201d Theron captioned the snapshot. \u201cFor real.\u201d And, not surprisingly, the whole world seems to approves of this empowered trio of ladies hanging out.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Theron has gushed about her Bombshell co-stars. Back in January, she posted a photo of her and Kidman at the 2019 Critics\u2019 Choice Awards. \u201cSuch a blast with this lady Sunday night,\u201d Theron wrote at the time. \u201cLove you, Nic!\u201d Adorably, Theron has also alluded to the fact that Kidman inspired her long before the two filmed Bombshell together.\n\nAccording to IMDB, Theron cited Kidman when asked about her ideal roles. \u201cI think the greatest characters are the unlikable ones, but mainly men get to play them. Rarely do women. And they are so delicious. Like Nicole Kidman in To Die For (1995), I wanted that character to live next to me,\u201d Theron reportedly said. \u201cDid I want her to be my daughter? No. But those characters are so interesting.\u201d\n\nFilming has already wrapped on Bombshell \u2014 it comes out in December \u2014 but here\u2019s hoping this incredible Hollywood throuple works together again.\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
