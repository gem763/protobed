Good grief,\" said Jim Pederson, a former state Democratic Party chair who ran for Senate in 2006.\n\n\u201cThe guy is a very personable, sharp guy. And he's made a lot of friends nationwide, and I think he's tapped into that network,\u201d Pederson said, adding that Arizonans were \"wrapped up into his enthusiasm.\"\n\nRepublicans have taken notice as well.\n\n\"It\u2019s not necessarily that Sen. McSally is doing poorly. It is that Mark Kelly is doing spectacularly,\u201d said Paul Bentz, a Republican strategist in Arizona. \u201cHe's doing above and beyond, I think, what anybody would have anticipated when it comes to fundraising.\n\n\u201cShe has the power of incumbency, but he has definitely caught up on many, if not all, other campaign metrics,\u201d Bentz added.\n\nArizona is a critical state in next year's elections, with the presidency and Senate majority up for grabs. Democrats won their first Senate race in three decades in the emerging swing state last year, when Democrat Kyrsten Sinema beat McSally to capture the seat held by GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, a conservative Trump opponent who retired as he drew the president's ire.\n\nSen.

McSally is running again to complete the remaining two years on McCain's unexpired term for 2021 and 2022.\n\nSeveral advantages have helped Kelly stockpile cash. Kelly was the first major Senate candidate to announce a bid, joining the race in February with built-in name ID and connections to donors through his work with a gun control organization he founded with Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in 2011. The national party has rallied behind Kelly, and he\u2019s avoided even a whiff of a primary challenge.\n\nKelly has also invested in building a campaign to last. He has spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads this year, which helps build a list of small-dollar donors that will benefit him down the road, according to data compiled by ACRONYM, a progressive digital organization. Last quarter, Kelly spent $1.9 million, with $420,000 of that earmarked for digital advertising and more than $640,000 for direct mail services, both designed to help raise new money.\n\nIn the third quarter, more than half of his money raised \u2014 $2.9 million \u2014 came in unitemized donations that are less than $200. He also raised nearly $1.3 million from donors who gave more than $1,000, including more than $667,000 from max-out donors.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is powered by grassroots supporters who are chipping in what they can, when they can because they support Mark\u2019s mission to be an independent voice for Arizona,\" said Jacob Peters, a spokesperson for Kelly's campaign.\n\nThe online money, in particular, is what has set Kelly apart early in the cycle.\n\n\u201cI think they've smartly rejected the dumb conventional wisdom out there that only super progressives can raise small dollars online,\u201d said Andy Barr, a Democratic strategist who worked on the 2012 Arizona Senate race.\n\nRepublicans acknowledge Kelly\u2019s fundraising prowess but say they are not caught off guard by it. The party expected him to raise significant sums after being recruited to join the race and praise McSally\u2019s efforts to keep pace \u2014 especially for someone in the unique position of preparing for reelection while also adjusting to her first nine months in the Senate.\n\n\u201cShe's doing great, doing the things a candidate and incumbent need to do,\u201d said Barrett Marson, a veteran Republican strategist who heads a super PAC that backs McSally. \u201cObviously, Mark Kelly is raising a lot of money. She can't control that. She can only control what she does, and Sen. McSally is doing the right things.\u201d\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

She raised $1.2 million in unitemized donations under $200, and her campaign said nearly 100,000 donors have given $100 or less. McSally spent nearly $350,000 on online fundraising, plus another $60,000 in fundraising list rentals, in the third quarter of the year, a larger investment than most other Republicans. Her campaign has lagged on Facebook, however, and has spent only $35,000 on the platform, according to the data from ACRONYM.\n\n\u201cMartha\u2019s consistently strong fundraising numbers prove that Arizonans are unified in their support for her to keep fighting for them in the U.S. Senate,\u201d said her general consultant, Terry Nelson, in a statement.\n\nDan Eberhart, a major GOP donor, warned that McSally would likely be outspent without \u201cmajor support\u201d from outside groups like the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with GOP leadership. But Republican groups recognize McSally is critical to a GOP majority and are planning to play big in Arizona.\n\n\u201cWe think Martha McSally is one of the most compelling leaders in America today, which is why Arizona was one of our largest investments in 2018 \u2014 and we expect it will be the same in 2020,\u201d said Jack Pandol, spokesperson for the Senate Leadership Fund.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/59/92/0666e04d4c0aa485df8596e4d7dd/191018-markkelly-gty-771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
