The swelling crowd repeated it back.\n\nAD\n\nA few protesters were reported injured, and the Red Cross said it dispatched five teams to move out the injured from the center of town. Reuters later reported, citing the National News Agency (NNA), that two foreign workers choked to death from a fire that spread to a building near the protests. The report could not be immediately confirmed.\n\nThere was no single immediate cause to protest \u2014 there were many. When wildfires engulfed several areas throughout Lebanon earlier this week, including the beloved historic Chouf mountain area, the problem was made worse when it was announced that three firefighting helicopters had been out of service for years and were missing spare parts. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said he would open an investigation to determine responsibility.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier Thursday, the minister of information announced plans by the cabinet to enforce 20 cents-a-day fee for Internet phone calls, including on WhatsApp and Facebook. He also revealed a proposal to be discussed by ministers to raise value-added tax to 15 percent by 2022.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe came down here because we want to bring down this corrupt regime that has been burning us for over 50 years, before they even burned the trees,\u201d said a 26-year-old accountant who identified himself as Kareem.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to depend on Cyprus or Turkey or Iran or Hezbollah,\u201d he said, referring to Cyprus sending helicopters to help with the fire. He said he loved Hezbollah, the Islamist group that is part of the government, and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, but that he believed the ministers were all corrupt.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNothing is going to change until the whole country protests.\u201d\n\nAs protesters discussed calling a strike Friday, the Ministry of Education announced that schools would be closed that day.\n\nLebanon has seen a wave in protests recently, driven by dire economic conditions made worse by the country\u2019s financial crisis. It is one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world, and recently the government declared a state of economic emergency. The government says it is seeking ways to fight deficit, but meanwhile, the country\u2019s currency, pegged against the dollar, remains under pressure.\n\nAD\n\nThe proposed Internet-phone fee, seen as a new revenue stream, was revoked after the protests. But it was not enough to appease the protesters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a job in three years,\u201d said Abed, a 40-year-old construction worker who said he blames everyone in government.\n\n\u201cThe country is burning,\u201d his friend Mohammed, 31, said. \u201cThey\u2019re burning our country, they\u2019re burning our trees. We don\u2019t even have a helicopter that can put out fires. We paid 15 million dollars for them to park them aside.\u201d\n\nHis voice shaking with anger, Mohammed continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t have water. We don\u2019t have tourism. Our beaches are abandoned, stolen, looted.\u201d\n\nHe listed the names of the country\u2019s prominent politicians: Prime Minister Saad Hariri, parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Nasrallah. \u201cThese are all thieves that need to be in jail as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWalid Jumblatt, the main leader of Lebanon\u2019s Druze sect, told a Lebanese TV channel following the protests that he spoke to Hariri and told him that they were in trouble. \u201cI prefer we leave and quit together,\u201d he told the LBC channel.\n\nInterior Minister Raya al-Hassan said the prime minister has not made a decision, adding that he would speak later on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf the government falls, any other government that follows will not have better options than the ones in front of the current government,\u201d she told a local news channel. \u201cChanging the government is not a solution, and if it fell then collapse will be inevitable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the early hours of Friday, a protester rammed his shovel into an advertising board until the shovel broke. He threw it aside and yelled, \u201cTo the Grand Serai!\u201d referring to the prime minister\u2019s office, before getting on his bike. Others drove behind him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClashes erupted hours later between protesters and the riot police when the crowd tried to advance toward the Grand Serai, the NNA reported. The police employed tear gas against the protesters.\n\nBut on one quiet street, soldiers lined up barricades and watched silently.\n\n\u201cRevolution, revolution,\u201d one soldier whispered.\n\nAD", "description": "Citing economic woes, thousands demand the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri\u2019s government.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sZKSczhK1NxWYuPD-W5zTdnP1mQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UTE5NWHRKAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
