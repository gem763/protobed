And he taught a little history, too. The Pose actor \u2014 wearing head-to-toe sparkles and a hat so massive it matches his larger-than-life personality \u2014 made sure to take every last one of us to church before sharing his gratitude. \u201cJames Baldwin said \u2018Took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I had been taught about myself, and halfway believed, before I could walk around this Earth like I had the right to be here\u2019,\u201d he quoted, adding, \u201cI have the right, you have the right, we all have the right!\u201d In Pose, Billy plays the dynamic Pray Tell, who guides his found family, even as he grapples with the turmoil of the AIDS epidemic. Billy Porter continues his legacy of making sure all of his successes leave the door open for more LGBTQ+ people of color to walk right in.
