An additional 1.3 million square feet is on the way with the bulk in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a new type of office tenant emerge with such speed and dominance since the dot-com boom,\u201d CBRE Canada Vice Chairman Paul Morassutti said in the report released Tuesday. \u201cThe rise of flexible office operators reflects the pace at which work and the workplace are evolving along with new technology, changing demographics and an overall push for innovation.\u201d\n\nLarge companies like WeWork, officially known as We Co., and IWG Plc are leading the charge, catering to demand from entrepreneurs, small businesses and companies looking for flexible leases and millennial-friendly office designs. Office vacancy rates in downtown Toronto fell to a record low 2.3 per cent in the third quarter, the tightest office market in North America.\n\nCBRE is tracking 10 flexible space operators which represent 71 per cent of the market. IWG\u2019s Space unit is the largest with 32 per cent of the market, followed by WeWork. Notable co-working deals include 171,000 square feet leased to WeWork in BentallGreenOak\u2019s new Vancouver development and Spaces which has 260,000 square feet in two Toronto locations.\n\nFlexible offices make up only 1.4 per cent of the 471.1 million square feet of office space nationwide, lagging the U.S., according to CBRE.\n\nWhile WeWork has been rapidly expanding in Canada, the New York-based company is facing challenges on multiple fronts. It\u2019s scrapped an initial public offering, stoking concerns about its ability to raise money to fuel growth, and its chief executive officer has stepped down. Landlords in London and New York are among the most exposed to any further deterioration at the co-working firm, but in Canada, they\u2019re less worried.\n\n\u201cAny of the spaces that we\u2019re leasing are very much in demand, so we would lease to other tenants if there was a problem with WeWork,\u201d Michael Cooper, CEO of Dream Office REIT, said in a phone interview. \u201cWeWork has been a real leader in this field and it\u2019s going to matter what happens with them, but there are other co-working organizations who I don\u2019t think this will affect.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "'We haven't seen a new type of office tenant emerge with such speed and dominance since the dot-com boom'", "authors": ["Natalie Wong", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wework.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
