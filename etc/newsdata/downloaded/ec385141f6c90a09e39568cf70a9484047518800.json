The public would participate in the experiment of looking at and thinking about modern art,\u201d Lowry said.\n\n\u201cHe understood that the museum was to be a work in progress, changing and evolving as modern and contemporary art changes and evolves,\u201d Lowry told reporters at a preview.\n\nThe museum took advantage of a real estate project by selling some land to a developer to build a luxury tower, in which MoMA would make use of the first three floors.\n\nBy also making some tweaks to its existing buildings, MoMA has increased its capacity to 165,000 square feet (15,329 square meters).\n\nThe upgrade, which cost $450 million, means the museum will be able to exhibit around 2,400 works a year, compared to an average of 1,500 previously, Lowry said.\n\nThe most radical change is that for the first time artworks will be presented by theme rather than by time period. The works will also have the benefit of more natural light.\n\n\u201cWhat makes modern and contemporary art exciting is precisely the debates and arguments that are still taking place,\u201d said Lowry.\n\n\u201c(We want to) make the public aware the questions are more interesting than the answers,\u201d he added.\n\nThemes and artwork will change every six months or so but the major pieces, such as Claude Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lilies\u201d and Pablo Picasso\u2019s \u201cThe Ladies of Avignon\u201d will always be on show.\n\n\u201cFor people who come and want to see the icons, they\u2019ll be there,\u201d said Lowry.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 New York\u2019s heralded Museum of Modern Art reopens this month after a multi-million-dollar makeover that will allow curators to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/bf3785_new-york-museum-modern-art-reopens-on-21-its-latest-expansion-new-york-museum-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
