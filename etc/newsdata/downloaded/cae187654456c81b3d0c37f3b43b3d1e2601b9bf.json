The area is also where the rule was primarily drafted, the attorneys wrote.\n\nSince Washington is where the rule was approved, that would be the second choice, the attorneys said.\n\nThe arguments are made in a notice that the government plans to formally ask for the move on Nov. 21.\n\nAn attorney for environmental groups that filed the complaint said there is drilling off California and the Trump Administration plans to expand drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n\n\"This rule affects all the country, all the coastlines,\" said Christopher Eaton of the environmental law firm Earthjustice.\n\nHe represents several national environmental groups as well as groups based in Louisiana and in North and South Carolina.", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) - The federal government wants a challenge to Trump administration rules for offshore drilling to be moved out of California.The case should...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
