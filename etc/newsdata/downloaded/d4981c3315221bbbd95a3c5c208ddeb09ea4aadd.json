The ACLU argued to a federal district court that the Department of Homeland Security failed to follow proper expedited removal procedures in handling Thuraissigiam's case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is a foundational principle of our Constitution that individuals deprived of their liberty have access to a federal court \u2014 this includes asylum-seekers whose lives are in danger,\u201d Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights' Project, said in a statement Friday.\n\nThuraissigiam told immigration officials that he had been abducted and beaten by a gang of men in Sri Lanka because he belonged to the oppressed Tamil ethnic group. Thuraissigiam also said he was at risk of being branded a traitor and tortured further if he were sent back.\n\nAn asylum officer decided during the expedited removal process that Thuraissigiam had not shown a credible fear of persecution at the prospect of returning to Sri Lanka.\n\nAfter the Ninth Circuit decided that a federal district court has jurisdiction to review Thuraissigiam's claims, the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nSolicitor General Noel Francisco wrote that the appeals court decision risks \"undermining the government\u2019s ability to control the border.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has had mixed results defending its crackdown on immigration before the Supreme Court. Next month, the top court will hear oral arguments over whether Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was lawful.\n\nUpdated at 4:50 p.m.", "description": "The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review an appeals court ruling\u00a0that migrants targeted for quick deportation have the right to make their claims before a federal court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/deportation_immigration_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
