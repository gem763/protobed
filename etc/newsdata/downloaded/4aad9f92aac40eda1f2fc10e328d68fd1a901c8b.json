As of late February, Rolls-Royce said 35 787s were grounded globally due to engine blades corroding or cracking prematurely.\n\nShares in Rolls-Royce were 3.4% lower on Friday, hovering around 783.7 pence in early trade, making them the biggest percentage losers on London's blue-chip index ( ).", "description": "Rolls-Royce sees further delay in Trent 1000 engine overhaul", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8J0HN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
