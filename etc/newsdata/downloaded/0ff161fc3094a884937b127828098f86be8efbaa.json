Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nTrump move seen as a green light for a Turkish invasion of Syria\n\nThe United States has begun withdrawing troops from the Syrian-Turkish border, after an announcement by President Trump that was criticized as an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters ahead of a long-threatened Turkish offensive into northern Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move follows a Sunday phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government considers the main Syrian Kurdish faction that fought the Islamic State to be as much of a danger as the Islamist militants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of potentially a seismic development in Syria,\u201d says geopolitics reporter Ishaan Tharoor , who writes for the Today\u2019s WorldViews newsletter , \u201cone that could reset the tables regionally in many ways \u2013 perhaps even trigger a new refugee exodus into Iraq and create all sorts of new security challenges that we\u2019ve yet to contemplate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018The general sense is that the workers have not been getting a fair slice of the pie\u2019\n\nMore than three weeks into one of the longest and largest private employer strikes in half a century, mass picket lines of auto workers have halted production at 55 General Motors factories and parts centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workers \u2013 some 50,000 who have stopped working and lost out on weeks of paychecks \u2013 say they want to regain ground lost in contract negotiations during the recession, now that the company is back to near-record profitability. GM meanwhile says it needs to keep pace with foreign automakers in the United States, which are not unionized and pay workers less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLabor unions have declined in numbers over the last decades, but there is this energy in the world right now,\u201d says national reporter Eli Rosenberg . He sat on a picket line in Martinsburg, W.Va. \u201cEmployees are getting more willing to fight and speak out for things they want.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes federal law protect LGBT workers from discrimination?\n\nThe gay rights movement won a huge victory in the Supreme Court in 2015, with the decision that affirmed a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut LGBT rights leaders say \u201cmarried on Sunday, fired on Monday\u201d is a possibility in more than half of U.S. states where there are no specific protections for gay or transgender workers. A case the court heard Tuesday could make protections concrete \u2013 or unsettle them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is debating a pretty blockbuster question: Is it legal to fire someone for being gay or transgender,\u201d reporter Caroline Kitchener says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, she spoke with people hoping to get inside the Supreme Court building to hear oral arguments. \u201cIt is an opportunity to constantly be talking to people and answering questions throughout the entire day,\u201d Kitchener says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Ishaan Tharoor on what the withdrawal of troops from Syria means for the Kurds.
