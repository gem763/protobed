And yet, say the authors, they are being given to people with mental health problems in Australia, the US and Canada, and demand is likely to grow.\n\nProf Louisa Degenhardt of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at UNSW Sydney, Australia, lead author of the study, said the findings had important implications in countries where medical use was allowed.\n\n\u201cThere is a notable absence of high-quality evidence to properly assess the effectiveness and safety of medicinal cannabinoids compared with placebo, and until evidence from randomised controlled trials is available, clinical guidelines cannot be drawn up around their use in mental health disorders,\u201d she said.\n\nCannabis: Miracle Medicine or Dangerous Drug? review \u2013 weeding out the truth Read more\n\n\u201cIn countries where medicinal cannabinoids are already legal, doctors and patients must be aware of the limitations of existing evidence and the risks of cannabinoids. These must be weighed when considering use to treat symptoms of common mental health disorders. Those who decide to proceed should be carefully monitored for positive and negative mental health effects of using medicinal cannabinoids.\u201d\n\nProfile Cannabis: a history Show Hide Cannabis: a history The earliest written reference to cannabis comes from China in the third millennium BC, but archaeological evidence suggests that hemp, probably for use in fabrics, was cultivated as early as 8,000BC. Native to Central Asia and India, the plant \u2013 known as ganja in Sanskrit \u2013 appears to have been recognised for its psychoactive properties among several pre-Christian cultures, some of which used it in rituals. It was banned in parts of the Islamic world in the 14th century, not to mention in some British colonies, but was not widely proscribed across the world until the US took against it. A series of regulations in the US culminated in the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 that banned possession or transfer of the drug, except for medicinal use. But it was not outlawed for all types of use until 1970, as the establishment reacted to hippie culture \u2013 a crackdown that continued with President Nixon\u2019s so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, which saw the US place pressure on international governments to follow suit. While countries such as the Netherlands have long defied such pressure, tolerating both medicinal and recreational use, international momentum towards legalisation has only begun to pick up in recent years with relaxation of the law in North America. California kicked off the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in 1996, several states had legalised recreational use by 2012 and a majority of states had legalised medicinal cannabis by 2016. It remains illegal under US federal law. Canada lifted a ban on recreational use in 2018, while the UK legalised medicinal marijuana in the same year, albeit subject to tight restrictions. According to the World Health Organization, there are about 147 million cannabis users worldwide, some 2.5% of the global population. While the US market is exploding thanks to liberalisation of laws at state level, Europe is predicted to be the world\u2019s biggest and most lucrative market for medicinal cannabis.

They found 83 studies in 3,000 people. But the evidence of a positive effect was sparse.\n\nThere was, they said, \u201clow-quality evidence\u201d that THC, one of the derivatives of cannabis, could be helpful to people with multiple sclerosis or chronic pain who were also suffering from anxiety. But it made people with psychosis worse.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that cannabinoids can help, the authors found more evidence in \u201ca large body of research\u201d of the potential harms. \u201cThis research suggests that cannabis use can increase the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptom,\u201d says the paper.\n\nA well-constructed study found that smoked cannabis actually increased the risk of acute psychotic symptoms. And young adults, the age group more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression and psychosis, are more likely to become dependent if they use cannabis daily over a long period of time.\n\n\u201cThese risks, and the limitations of existing evidence, need to be weighed when considering the use of medicinal cannabinoids to treat symptoms of common mental disorders. Those who decide to proceed should be carefully monitored for positive and negative mental health effects of using medicinal cannabinoids,\u201d they write.\n\nIn a comment piece in the journal, Deepak Cyril D\u2019Souza of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, said that \u201cin light of the paucity of evidence, the absence of good quality evidence for efficacy, and the known risk of cannabinoids, their use as treatments for psychiatric disorders cannot be justified at present.\u201d\n\nIn modern medicine, it is normal practice to prove safety and efficacy in trials before drugs are allowed to be given out to patients.\n\n\u201cIf cannabinoids are to be used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, they should first be tested in randomised controlled trials and subjected to the same regulatory approval process as other prescription medications,\u201d he add.", "description": "New study shows evidence of positive outcomes is scarce while symptoms can be exacerbated", "authors": ["Sarah Boseley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f9d82a004b85aa6009f7a9862991df88e02e9f/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8647b7a4d10fe74ca9d038b0eb63c1fc", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
