Not even Pat Robertson, a Trump stalwart if ever there was one, wants to follow the president on this one. Trump \u201cis in great danger of losing the mandate of Heaven\u201d if he spurns the Kurds, Robertson said.\n\nTrump\u2019s old techniques are failing\u2014and not just due to the volume of the bad news. What\u2019s unique about this phase of his presidency is that he\u2019s being attacked with so much damning information from so many directions and so many different power centers that he can\u2019t keep up. Not even a street fighter with Bruce Lee\u2019s skills could repulse this sort of pile-on.\n\nAs somebody who has never counted out Trump, I believe he could restore his good fortune with some self-discipline. Midway through the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, columnist (and doctor of psychiatry) Charles Krauthammer took to calling the \u201cgeneral hysteria\u201d the press and the political classes expressed for the president \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d According to Krauthammer and others, this reflexive, partisan hatred for Trump crippled people\u2019s judgment of the man. Krauthammer urged us to stop listening to Trump\u2019s id and pay more attention to what Trump was doing and what he had done. Finally, it appears, the press and Democrats have independently taken Krauthammer\u2019s advice. As we enter impeachment autumn, the only principal still acting deranged is Trump himself.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
