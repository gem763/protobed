But they slid back substantially over the next few weeks to close at $2.96 on Wednesday.\n\nSerko announced on Thursday that Booking Holdings, which is listed on the NASDAQ exchange in the United States, would end up with a shareholding of about 4.7 per cent in the company as a cornerstone investor.\n\nThe overall capital raising consists of a primary placement of NZ$40 million of new shares, along with a secondary sale of shares of NZ$16 million by Mr Grafton, chairman Simon Botherway and some other Serko employees.\n\nA share purchase plan is being offered to shareholders to raise up to NZ$5 million.\n\nMr Grafton's selldown represents about 13 per cent of his current holding in the company.\n\nThe placement is being underwritten by New Zealand stockbroker Deutsche Craigs Ltd.\n\nRipsy Bandourian, the vice-president of partnerships at Booking.com, said the group had similar views about making business travel ''frictionless'' for both travellers and travel managers.\n\nSerko has already been investing heavily in an expansion in the United States after buying US expense management business InterplX last year.", "description": "The US$83 billion online travel giant which owns Booking.com and agoda.com is the biggest investor in a capital raising by dual-listed Serko.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/791e021098110d8b5fde599c82c75cd21c3adb5a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
