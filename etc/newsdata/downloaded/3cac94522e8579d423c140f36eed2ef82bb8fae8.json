Women who, currently, get only about 23% of any redistributed land?\n\nIn other words, is land reform trying to create a black commercial farmer class alongside a white one, or fundamentally is land reform trying to disrupt the agricultural economy and cultivate thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of small-scale black farmers?\n\nIf it is the first, then this fire and fury about constitutional amendments is merely a cheap, populist stunt aimed at pacifying a black electorate angry at how, in their perception, white people haven\u2019t been made to \u201cpay in\u201d to create Nelson Mandela\u2019s dream of a unified rainbow nation.\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that President Ramaphosa has taken to calling white South Africans lackadaisical, because, despite all his flaws, he is keenly aware of this existing perception among certain South Africans.\n\nWith regard to the second, since 1994, more than half of all farmland has been transacted on the open market and many of the new owners are companies and pension funds rather than white families.\n\nThe ANC\u2019s vision of expropriation without compensation is a soppy, inconsistent and ultimately useless middle ground that will neither allay investor fears about undermined private property rights nor deliver the promised \u201cdignity\u201d to the landless poor.\n\nThe EFF has an unabashedly Marxist view of land and the ancillary (and disastrous) policies of protectionism and price controls go along with it.\n\nThe EFF is clearer about its racial stance on land as one of the means of \u201cslitting the throat of whiteness\u201d.\n\nIts vision is decidedly one of racial Marxism and one that relies on a very strong antagonism towards free markets, private property rights, and any semblance of impartial institutions.\n\nThe EFF, too, is far more honest about what expropriation is about, mainly that, in the popular imagination, free markets and private property rights are vestiges of colonial and imperial subjugation and not to be trusted.\n\nThose of us who believe in free markets and private property rights, both on principle and pragmatic terms, should take care to recognise that this boils down to a game of thrones between two competing views of the world.\n\nSo, no matter the differences between the EFF and the ANC, the endgame is the same; domination by the state.\n\nA view that free individuals in a free society cannot be trusted to know where their best interests lie.\n\n\u2022 Sindile Vabaza is an avid writer and aspiring economist.
