The reports say Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has canceled the summit due to violent riots in the country.\n\nThe meeting had been expected to be the setting for a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese dictator Xi Jinping. It was anticipated that the two leaders would sign an interim, \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal. White House officials are scrambling to see if a new venue can be found for the two leaders to meet, according to a White House source.\n\nViolent riots broke out in Chile following a hike in the price of public transportation. Many Chileans look at this as a tax cut on working and middle class people and the protests have broadened to attack what many protestors describe as an economy rigged to favor wealthy elites.", "description": "Violent riots in Chile have thrown the \"phase one\" trade deal between the U.S. and China into doubt. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177480157-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
