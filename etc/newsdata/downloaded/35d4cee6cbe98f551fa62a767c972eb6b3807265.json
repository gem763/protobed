He had apparently outlined his old foes\u2019 failings in some detail while admitting \u201cI have ideas\u201d when it comes to any potential vacancy at Old Trafford. As it happened, Wenger had made no such comments during a broadcast interview in which his actual observations were considerably more moderate. Somebody had completely made them up and, in a parable for these times, undue haste in places that should know better ensured the nonsense quickly spread.\n\nThe rush to inform the world that the former Arsenal manager had dangled vaguely provocative remarks in relation to United told of something else, too. Where there would once have been a queue of protagonists capable of fanning the flames before this fixture, the most expedient way to set pulses racing before Monday night\u2019s meeting was to stir controversy through voices from the past.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r accepts Manchester United need more strikers Read more\n\n\u201cOn Monday at eight o\u2019clock, in all the world, if someone wants to watch a game of football it\u2019s this one,\u201d said a current participant, Unai Emery, last week. He was right in one way, because it does not clash with any other game in a major league. But anyone still tuning in for the spit and snarl of the 1990s and 2000s \u2013 the bust-ups involving Schmeichel, Wright, Keane, Vieira, Keown, Van Nistelrooy, F\u00e0bregas, a pizza buffet, Wenger and Ferguson \u2013 will be short-changed. This used to be the perfect Premier League rivalry: a showdown between high achievers from London and the north-west who, deep down, knew they had more in common than anyone would admit. Nowadays, viewers coming in from the cold would require a history lesson to ascribe any real gravitas to what they are watching.\n\nThere are, at least, plenty of similarities this time; just nothing anyone would crow to their established rivals about. Both clubs finished outside the top four last season, the second time that has happened in three years; there are question marks over both managers, still trying to rebuild after being dealt questionable legacies by their famous predecessors; both must grub around in the Europa League for their continental gratification and neither has yet made a compelling case for a return to the top level next season.\n\nThirteen years have passed since Arsenal last won a league game at United\u2019s home and they have tended to let them off the hook there of late. Last season the hosts were deep into the end times of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s reign but the London side, despite going ahead twice, failed to see out a game riddled with mishaps. Most of their visits since the 8-2 capitulation in 2011 have at least been hard-fought but Arsenal\u2019s arrival has broadly become a pick-me-up: an occasion on which United can persuade themselves they have the number of a fellow pretender to the elite.\n\nIt means United\u2019s distressing injury list may yet prove less of a hindrance than any mental block Arsenal have developed. But it is doubtful that, under Wenger or Emery, the away side have come up against a weaker Old Trafford adversary than the one Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will send out. They have a clear opportunity to shake off their hoodoo and, in the process, distance themselves from those comparisons of mediocrity. Even if Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial were fit, there is plenty to suggest Arsenal have better players \u2013 or players of greater potential \u2013 than United in most areas. Mason Greenwood is an exception to the latter but it would be a tall order for him to repeat the impact Rashford had when Arsenal visited in February 2016, scoring twice on his Premier League debut.\n\nManchester United v Arsenal: match preview Read more\n\nA callow Rashford\u2019s fortunes that day added to the lore of Arsenal being an obliging visitor. This season Emery\u2019s team have been fun, their frailties compensated for by the clinical brilliance of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and \u2013 in recent weeks \u2013 the wild-eyed tenacity of Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi. But the head coach\u2019s strategy is hardly obvious and there is a sense that a weekly white knuckle ride is not exactly the way he would rather have it. Whatever plan Solskj\u00e6r has for United is little clearer: the Norwegian\u2019s appointment was largely predicated on the fanbase\u2019s vast reserves of goodwill for their old hero, an advantage Emery has not been able to enjoy in struggling to establish a rapport at the Emirates, but his reign\u2019s early exuberance was soon weighed down by question marks.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up for our daily football email.\n\nIt was Arsenal who warned, four days after United\u2019s spirited but streaky win at Paris Saint-Germain in March, that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s magic might have limits when they won 2-0 at home. Granit Xhaka was one of the scorers and the debate over his selection as Arsenal captain seems light years from the era when Solskj\u00e6r and Freddie Ljungberg \u2013 an increasingly visible presence alongside Emery in Arsenal\u2019s technical area \u2013 would take their lead from Keane and Vieira. Neither set of fans would have dreamed of jeering their own skipper from the field, as happened to Xhaka last weekend against Aston Villa, back then, but the context and personalities surrounding this fixture have changed beyond recognition.\n\n\u201cWill they emulate what Giggs, Scholes, Beckham did over the years? Personally I\u2019m not convinced,\u201d Wenger said of United\u2019s current crop in quotes that, this time, were incontrovertibly his. Even the most one-eyed regular at Old Trafford might agree. Anyone seeking to set fires raging around this year\u2019s encounter with Arsenal is left flailing for ways to get the old feeling back.", "description": "This fixture used to revolve around the likes of Vieira, Keane and Keown as both sides have much work to do to be title contenders again", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c98bba2d2b3c480d74a994c3edf7af48a688f1ff/0_154_4605_2763/master/4605.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b6cb839dc85c38a0c5827d79e30c4bc", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
