[YONHAP]\n\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia - As BTS began singing their 2019 hit \u201cDionysus\u201d at the King Fahd International Stadium last Friday evening, the 30,000 fans in attendance roared in excitement.Fortunately for the fans, the boy band was also full of energy after a two-month break from performing and promotions.Group leader RM warmed up the crowd with a heartfelt opening statement.\u201cWe know that you\u2019re sending us a lot of love from far away. So we\u2019re hosting a festival for the ARMY [fans] who\u2019ve waited a long time for BTS.\u201dThe boy group gave it all they got, and were joined by emotional fans as they performed 24 of their biggest hits including \u201cBoy With Luv,\u201d \u201cIdol\u201d and \u201cFake Love.\u201dAlthough the global superstars kicked off their Saudi concert with the same opening track as their show at Wembley in Britain in June, there were noticeable differences between the two shows.About 70 percent of the women in the audience members were donned in Islamic head coverings like niqabs, hijabs or chadors over abayas, a black outer garment that comes down to the feet. The crowd was made up of thousands of fans who had made their way from across the country and overseas to catch the Saudi leg of BTS\u2019s \u201cLove Yourself: Speak Yourself\u201d world tour, the first-ever solo concert held by a non-Saudi artist at a stadium in the country.The group made a few changes to their choreography, opting not to show their abs, for example, in respect of the Muslim culture. Public dancing was forbidden in Saudi Arabia until just two years ago.The King Fahd International Stadium not only opened its doors to a foreign artist for the first time, but many of the fans in attendance were also making their first visit to the stadium.The 32-year-old outdoor arena began accepting female visitors from September 2017, and has allowed them to view football matches since January 2018.BTS made notable efforts to respect the culture and religion of their Saudi fans.Concert organizers set up carpets to allow Muslim fans to fulfill their five daily prayer times. Rehearsals were paused at 5:31 p.m., the fourth prayer time of the day, and the concert was deliberately scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. so fans could finish their 7:01 p.m. prayer beforehand. Female staff members of the concert wore abayas.Showing interest and communicating in Arabic also made a good impression.\u201cArabic is one of the most difficult languages to learn, but we really appreciated how BTS prepared greetings in Arabic as a special present for ARMY,\u201d said Alya Alrashidi, a university student and concert attendee. The members had said phrases like \u201cI love you,\u201d \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d in the language, even singing Sana Helwa Ya Gameel, or happy birthday, to member Jimin, who celebrated his birthday on Sunday.\u201cEveryone in my family, including my cousins, are BTS fans,\u201d added Norah, Alrashidi\u2019s sister. \u201cI really want to attend their concert in Korea in the future.\u201dThe members of BTS weren\u2019t the only ones showing off their impressive language skills. Many fans at the concert spoke considerable Korean, including Bedour Ahmed.\u201cMy Korean name is Cho Ara, and my Korean age is 26,\u201d she said in Korean, carefully articulating her syllables.\u201cI became a BTS fan after being touched by the lyrics of \u2018Spring Day.\u2019 I was able to find my true self thanks to the song,\u201d added Han, who operates Twitter account ArabRM. The account, which posts updates about RM in Arabic, is followed by over 13,000 fans.The arrival of the superstars also coincided with some major changes in the Saudi government\u2019s tourism regulations as well.Prior to last month, it was difficult to get a tourist visa without an invitation from a local. But on Sept. 27, just in time for the big show, the government initiated a new visa system that made it easier for visitors from 49 countries - including Korea - to apply for a 90-day stay.\u201cI had to cancel my flight and accommodation at first because I was unable to receive my visa, but I rebooked everything last minute when I finally got my visa,\u201d said Abha Nayak, a 30-year-old accountant from India. \u201cMany Indian fans had their visas rejected. I hope that BTS will be able to perform in India.\u201dThere were some minor hiccups along the journey to this historical concert. Limited public transportation was available around the stadium, and the traffic congestion was heavy.To the relief of Saudi fans, the 2.5-hour concert finished with no major incident, and also helped to instill hope for further positive engagement between Saudi Arabia, Korea and the rest of the world.\u201cPeople were worried and hoping that this concert would run smoothly, and I\u2019m glad everything went well,\u201d said Maha Al Nasser, a 27-year-old banker. \u201cI hope [the concert] can help reduce some of the prejudices against the Middle East.\u201dA boost to Korea\u2019s image thanks to the popularity of BTS was also welcomed by the many Korean nationals living in the country.\u201cThanks to BTS, the image of Korea, which was only known for Samsung phones and Hyundai cars, has improved among the young fans,\u201d said 56-year-old Lim Tae-won, who has resided in Saudi Arabia for the past 24 years. He facilitated rides for fans going to the stadium in a limousine bus.For BTS, it was the love from fans that ultimately made everything possible. \u201cARMY gave us wings to fly from Korea,\u201d said Jungkook.BTS will hold the final shows of their world tour at the Seoul Olympic Stadium in Jamsil, southern Seoul beginning on Oct. 26.BY KIM YOUNG-MI [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]This special report was written by Kim Young-mi, head of marketing firm Mushroom.
