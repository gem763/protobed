She also told broadcaster Deutsche Welle that Chancellor Angela Merkel had been informed of the proposal.\n\nGermany\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, must approve foreign deployments of the Bundeswehr, Germany\u2019s military.\n\nThe German government considers the Turkey led incursion to be a violation of international law, but so far has only restricted some military exports to Turkey along with other states including Spain, Sweden the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that an attack on Kurdish units or Kurdish militia is legitimate under international law,\u201d AFP reported Foreign Minister Heiko Maas as saying on Sunday. \u201cIf there is no basis in international law for such an invasion, then it can\u2019t be in accordance with international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them have their borders,\u201d Trump said, referring to Turkey, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders at home.\u201d https://t.co/j98OkNZYx3 \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 13, 2019\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s proposal could increase tensions within Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition as the co-governing Social Democrats reject outright any direct German military involvement in Syria.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer defended her idea, saying she could no longer hear German politicians merely saying they were concerned about the violence in Syria without acting. Germany and its ruling parties must do more and help solve international crises, the minister said.\n\nOne thing that can be assured is that the U.S. will not be joining any military security zone.\n\nSpeaking last Wednesday to reporters in the Oval Office, President Trump said the conflict between Turkey and Syria is between the two Middle Eastern countries alone, as Britbart News reported.\n\n\u201cThey have a problem at the border; it\u2019s not our border,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cIf Syria wants to fight for their land, that\u2019s up to Turkey and Syria,\u201d he added. \u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d", "description": "Germany\u2019s defense minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer wants Europe to contribute combat forces to a security zone in Syria.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Turkish-army-tank-toward-Syria-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
