It was a very serious breach and he was left in no uncertain terms that he had overstepped the mark.\n\n\"He was told he was being fined and the figure was a couple of thousand pounds.\u201d\n\nBosses are forever warning the Corrie cast about plugging products and services on social media, according to insiders.\n\nIn the past, they said it was as much to protect young stars as the iconic brand. The same rules stop stars taking on paid advertising work and limit them to personal appearances to make extra cash.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\nBut the move has frustrated the cast \u2013 especially younger stars.\n\nDad-of-three Jack had 3,000 hairs implanted into his scalp after suffering dramatic hair loss.

One of my mates had a transplant and looked so much better I didn\u2019t recognise him.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nJack \u2013 whose male rape storyline is about to reignite when co-star Ryan Clayton returns\u2013 is not the first Corrie star to get a transplant.\n\nPal Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone Dobbs, had one in 2016.\n\nThe cast were first warned off plugging products in 2013 after Brooke Vincent and Cath Tyldesley were caught in a Channel 4 sting.\n\nThey accepted free \u201canti-ageing\u201d skin toner and \u201cenergising bracelets\u201d and told fans how good they were \u2013 but the brand was a front for a Dispatches programme.\n\nA Corrie spokesman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss contractual matters.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The actor broke strict advertising rules by releasing a social media video gushing about the follicle-boosting procedure at a Manchester clinic", "authors": ["Janine Yaqoob", "Image", "Cavendish Press", "Manchester", "Ltd", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566758.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Coronation-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
