Corporations and educators have to be focused on the same thing. I believe how we proceed has to be a holistic effort.\u201d\n\nProfessor Glenn Wightwick, the deputy vice-chancellor of innovation and enterprise at UTS, says Telstra turned to the universities because of their research expertise and their ability to offer courses in small chunks, or micro-credentials, which can be taught inside the company.\n\nProfessor Glenn Wightwick says the Telstra training offers opportunities to UTS. Peter Braig\n\nWightwick says universities are good at credentialling, and staff want credentials that will last beyond their life at Telstra. For its part, UTS wants to place students in the company and offer postgraduate pathways into Telstra. The university also has an eye on research opportunities, with high-speed wireless, antennas, 5G, food innovation and the internet of things all part of its core activities.\n\n\u201cTelstra is evolving from a communications company to a technology company,\u201d says Wightwick. \u201cThat\u2019s an opportunity for us. We can work with them in a way we can\u2019t work with other global businesses which only have sales and marketing teams in Australia.\n\n\u201cAs a national carrier, Telstra has enormous investment in rural Australia, it\u2019s advanced in mobile technology, and it\u2019s a big investor in technology. That makes them an important partner for a university like UTS.\u201d\n\nAs employees and employers increasingly recognise a greater need for lifelong learning, companies are stepping in to fill gaps in the education system.\n\nAthletic clothing retailer Lululemon recently partnered with Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne to offer a diploma of business to managers. Torrens University Australia has established a partnership with Flight Centre to meet the development needs of travel and tourism workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, Microsoft launched a traineeship program, delivered by TAFE NSW, aimed at creating a new pipeline of IT talent, where trainees will receive a Certificate IV in Information Technology.\n\nIn September, University of Sydney Business School dean Professor Gregory Whitwell warned that employers had unrealistic expectations about the skills they demand of university business graduates.\n\nAs well as technical skills, graduates are expected to be able to work with diverse teams, be inclusive, good at asking questions rather than providing immediate solutions, able to challenge the status quo and to think critically, be resilient and have empathy.\n\n\u201cTo ask someone to be able to demonstrate all those things is a very big ask,\u201d Whitwell said, suggesting that companies needed to take greater responsibility for skills levels.\n\nFighting for talent\n\nTelstra\u2019s skills push comes as it implements its T22 strategy, designed to make the business leaner as the communications and technology sector becomes a battlefield for revenue.\n\nBy 2022, a net 8000 positions will have been lost, but 1500 new positions will have been created for employees with advanced technology skills. In the next year, 10 per cent of the existing workforce will be retrained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Australia facing a crippling shortage of software designers, companies such as Telstra say they are fighting with other tech businesses to hire from a small pool of skilled workers.\n\nTelstra is a registered training organisation and can teach and give credentials to its own staff, much like a private vocational education provider. But the scale of the T22 reorganisation required a different approach, so the company sought ideas from universities. UTS came back with a package at three levels: internships and future work placements, 5G research and community impact.\n\nBadenoch says the company needs to augment its skills base, but it can\u2019t afford to send staff to university. Short courses, taught in-house by a university, are a good solution.\n\nTransferable, relevant and recognised skills are the future, she says. \u201cWe recognise that skills are going to become the people\u2019s currency.\u201d", "description": "The telecommunications giant has enlisted university help to boost workforce skills in big data, cyber technology and artificial intelligence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4639%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_525%2C$y_262/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ac026ccab4ed9729d2bafca53ccd5f73115c540c", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
