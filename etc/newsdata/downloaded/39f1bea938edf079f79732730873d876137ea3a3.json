Waller-Bridge is being licensed to work on a future James Bond film\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge is being licensed to work on a future James Bond film.\n\nThe award-winning writer and actress is being wooed to contribute to the script for Bond 26, which is still years away.\n\nWaller-Bridge was hired by 007 producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, at Daniel Craig\u2019s behest, to \u2018add a layer\u2019 to the screenplay for Bond 25 \u2014 or No Time To Die \u2014 which has been shooting in Jamaica, Scotland, Norway, Italy and London.\n\nThe idea was to allow her to punch up the dialogue spoken by the female characters. But soon she was writing for the blokes, too. And then delving into scenes involving genetic warfare. \u2018Ian Fleming\u2019s Bond is a red-blooded male, and to some ears he lives in such a misogynistic world we had to be sensitive to the changing moral landscape,\u2019 an executive close to the production told me.\n\n\u2018Phoebe\u2019s contribution was great \u2014 far greater than we\u2019d anticipated. She\u2019s the saviour of Bond, really,\u2019 I was told. \u2018She was across the entire script.\u2019\n\n007 producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson British Academy Cymru Awards\n\nNo Time To Die opens here on April 3 next year; and heaven only knows when the next Bond after that will go into production. But Waller-Bridge is being asked to join the Bond family and contribute. How much she\u2019ll actually work on Bond 26 will depend on who directs it. Will Cary Joji Fukunaga return or will it be someone else?\n\n007 producer Barbara Broccoli at the Fleabag play press night\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, though: there will be a new actor to play the complex British intelligence officer. Craig has said No Time To Die will be his last outing as 007. \u2018Yes, he\u2019s saying this is his last movie as Bond, sadly,\u2019 Broccoli told me back in April.\n\nWaller-Bridge is the star with the golden pen. Her BBC TV show Fleabag won three Emmy awards in Los Angeles at the weekend, in a night when British-based stations (the BBC and Sky) snared a ton of top prizes.\n\nI speak to a lot of folk who work on Bond. A few months ago they were grousing about this and that. Now, they\u2019re happier than I\u2019ve known them in years. \u2018Phoebe\u2019s been having the best time; and the joy has sprinkled down,\u2019 my source told me.\n\n\u2018At first, no one knew what was going on. Now everyone\u2019s happy. This is going to be a great Bond.\u2019\n\nI hope so.\n\n007 producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli with actor Daniel Craig at the Bond 25 Film Launch at Ian Fleming's Home, Goldeneye, Jamaica\n\n(From left to right) Lea Seydoux, Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris and Lashana Lynch announcing Bond 25 at Ian Fleming's home, Goldeneye, Jamaica\n\nIt\u2019s never too late for an ageing Boy Friend to get a makeover\n\nAmara Okereke will play the ing\u00e9nue Polly (the poor little rich girl ... a role made famous by Julie Andrews on stage and Twiggy on screen).\n\nThe Boy Friend, Sandy Wilson\u2019s romantic musical written in the Fifties, but set in the Twenties, is going to have \u2018a little overhaul\u2019 before it opens at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London.\n\nFirst staged in London in 1953, the show, about British \u2018gels\u2019 attending a finishing school in Nice, is a charming piece. But David Babani who runs the Chocolate Factory and Matthew White, who will direct, have been concerned about a number called It\u2019s Never Too Late To Fall In Love that\u2019s sung in the third act by Lord Brockhurst (who\u2019ll be played by Adrian Edmondson) to a girl less than half his age.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got a 62-year-old trying to serenade a 17-year-old, so the scene\u2019s going to be slightly retuned, with permission from Wilson\u2019s estate, for the #Me Too society that we now live in,\u2019 Babani told me.\n\nActress and model Twiggy, as she appears in the film 'The Boyfriend', 1971 (left and right). The film follows the demure stage manager, Polly, played by Twiggy, as she is put under the spotlight to take the place of the injured leading lady\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just about making The Boy Friend, that was written in a very different time, palatable for the time we are in now, with the values that are, quite rightly, very current.\u2019\n\nWould people recoil at such a scene? \u2018We think so, yes,\u2019 Babani said. \u2018Therefore that won\u2019t be occurring, in our production.\u2019\n\nHe added that \u2018it\u2019s our responsibility to deliver a revival that works for today. If not, you\u2019re just presenting museum pieces in a vacuum.\u2019 But he added, pointedly: \u2018There\u2019s a difference between reinvention and bastardisation.\u2019\n\nThe cool company stars Janie Dee as Madame Dubonnet, the principal of the aforementioned school. Tiffany Graves is Hortense the French maid; Amara Okereke will play the ing\u00e9nue Polly (the poor little rich girl ... a role made famous by Julie Andrews on stage and Twiggy on screen).\n\nDylan Mason is Tony, the mystery messenger boy full of surprises; and Jack Butterworth is playboy Bobby van Husen.\n\nIssy Van Randwyck has signed on for the role of Lady Brockhurst in the show which starts performances on November 22. The A-list creative team includes choreographer Bill Deamer and designer Paul Farnsworth.\n\nThe cool company stars Janie Dee as Madame Dubonnet, the principal of the aforementioned school\n\nDirector Sam West has gathered a tremendous ensemble at the Menier for Laura Wade\u2019s comedy of manners, The Watsons, including Grace Molony, Paksie Vernon, Jane Booker, Joe Bannister, Louise Ford, Rhianna McGreevy and Isaac Forward.

Burns told me that being able to sing is top of the wish list. \u2018Voice is number one. If they can\u2019t sing, they can\u2019t play it,\u2019 she said.\n\nAlong with the open calls, actors can send a tape or video of them singing the first 16 bars of the opening number Don\u2019t Even Know It to jamiecasting@nimaxtheatres.com.

Zellweger\u2019s the Oscar front-runner in the best actress category and I have a sneaking sense it could land a best picture nomination, too. Wednesday marks the start of the BFI\u2019s London Film Festival. When I was a kid I dreamt of watching pictures at the festival.
