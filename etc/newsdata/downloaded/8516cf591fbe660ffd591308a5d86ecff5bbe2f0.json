A street artist called \u201cJohn Criscitello \u2026 told Bourdain how the high-tech influx has driven up housing costs and forced artists [like himself] out of the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nYes, Big Tech is exacerbating homelessness in Seattle and the surrounds. While correlation is not causation, the ongoing and never-ending, annual importation of a sizable feudal elite from China and India must surely be factored in the homelessness equation.\n\n\u201cBuoyed by the city\u2019s thriving technology industry, Seattle has consistently been the hottest housing market in the nation.\u201d Commensurate with the explosion in the number of Seattle neighborhoods in which homes cost $1 million has been an explosion in the region\u2019s homeless population.\n\n\u201cHouseholds must earn about $140,000 a year to afford mortgage payments \u2013 nearly double the city\u2019s typical income,\u201d but on par with the \u201caverage base pay\u201d of a software engineer in the Seattle, WA area.\n\nSome consciousness of guilt was evinced by Microsoft. The company threw money at a problem to which it has greatly contributed. In 2014, Microsoft allocated $500 million toward low-income housing, because, somehow, working-class families who should be inching into middle-class were sliding into poverty, unable to afford homes in Seattle and its surrounding counties.\n\n\u201cThere are more families with children than chronically homeless people\u201d in the homeless encampments, reveals the Seattle Times. \u201cFewer than 50 percent of people without homes are addicts.\u201d Underlying homelessness are factors such as \u201closs of a job,\u201d \u201ceviction,\u201d \u201cmedical bills and foreclosure,\u201d the last of which \u201cdestroys credit ratings, making former homeowners no longer eligible for loans or, in many cases, rentals.\u201d\n\nAmong her homeless acquaintances, local writer Lola Peters counts \u201c[a] seamstress, her mortgage broker husband and their two children.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral couples going through the breakup of long-term relationships. A nurse. The middle-aged couple who owned their home and two nearby rental houses. A woman, with a 4-year old child, who lost her job shortly after moving to Seattle. A floral delivery worker. A painter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not alcoholics or drug addicts,\u201d protests Peters. \u201cThey are people who suffered as a result of political and economic decisions they had no part in.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only Seattle and its suburbs that are filled with suffering, marginalized Americans.\n\nVia CBS News comes the unwelcome news that, \u201cEven with rising wages and falling mortgage rates, Americans can\u2019t afford a home in more than 70 percent of the country. Out of 473 U.S. counties analyzed in a report, 335 listed median home prices more than what average wage earners could afford, according to a report from ATTOM Data Solutions.\u201d\n\nDriven by an unending influx of immigrants, realtor.com certainly revels in the tight housing market created by immigration central planners:\n\n\u201c[S]waths of America have seen local housing fundamentally altered by an influx of new immigrant groups. There are now about 42 million immigrants from just about every country in the world living in the U.S., making up about 13 percent of the overall population, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cImmigrants are a big driving force for housing markets across the nation,\u201d says Kusum Mundra, an economics professor at Rutgers University, Newark. \u201cMost want the American dream, which is to own a home.\u201d\n\nWith The World clamoring for the American Dream, the average home in the U.S. will soon cost half a million dollars. \u201cRents are rising much faster than income, while the median home price in some 200 cities is $1 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cHomelessness\u2014perhaps the most extreme form of poverty\u2014is a symptom, surging in high-cost cities,\u201d notes the Economist. \u201cThe problem,\u201d moreover, \u201cis most acute in America\u2019s most-thriving cities, the ones governed by unabashed liberals. In 2018, New York estimated its homeless population to be over 79,000, or 48 percent more than in 2010. \u2026 California now accounts for one in four homeless Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnabashed liberal\u201d outfits like the Economist, the Brooking Institute and the Seattle Times blame inadequate supply for the housing crisis, ignoring the demand side of the supply-and-demand housing equation whereby, \u201cBig Tech is permitted to petition The State for permission to import The World at a price heavily subsidized by the disenfranchised American taxpayer. Through government immigration policies, a ceaseless demand for housing has been generated.\u201d (See \u201cHomeless In Seattle, Part 1.\u201d)\n\nIn particular does the Economist implicate \u201clocal control over zoning\u201d for \u201cpoor housing supply.\u201d\n\nHistorically, zoning regulations, whereby municipal governments decide \u201cwhat parts of the city will be industrial, residential or commercial,\u201d are linked to high-cost housing. However, city planners have been determining where people live, work and do business for close to a century. Pure market forces and the price system have been absent in city planning for a very long time.\n\nIt is, therefore, more edifying to survey the special interests currently involved in the anti-zoning debate. These are the grubby interests of the developers, the realtors and the municipalities (hunkering after more property taxes). All are protesting the idea of the \u201cSingle-family home that offers people a chance at traditional, white-picket fence homeownership.\u201d\n\nDevelopment fiends and fanatics all hunger for the revenues that come from \u201cdense housing,\u201d namely \u201cany housing that\u2019s attached to another unit, often in taller buildings: apartments, condos, town homes, row houses.\u201d\n\nAgainst this background, it seems clear that the egalitarians have appropriated the anti-zoning argument. They now malign single-family neighborhoods in favor of promoting density, which is\u2014wouldn\u2019t you know it?\u2014more expensive and thus lucrative.\n\nTo the working poor, the new cellblock units that replace single-family homes are worse than useless, as they cost so much more than the homes torn down.\n\nNo wonder the Economist clucks in outrage against \u201clocal control over zoning.\u201d As ruthless and reckless as it is, local government is more likely than state or federal governments to be responsive to the petitions of single-family homeowners against building \u201cdense housing,\u201d to accommodate Jeff Bezos\u2019 H-1B visa arrivals.\n\nThe World is the American multinational\u2019s labor marker. The housing market in the U.S. reflects that reality. Unburdened by brains, politicos remain incurious as to why supply and demand in housing can never be brought into a semblance of a balance in such a perversely global labor market.\n\n**\n\nPART 1: \u201cHomeless In Seattle: High-Tech & The Homeless.\u201d\n\nIlana Mercer has been writing a weekly, paleolibertarian column since 1999.
