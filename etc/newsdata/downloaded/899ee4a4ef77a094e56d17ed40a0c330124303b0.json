Glitzy Tory promises won\u2019t save it | Rachel Clarke", "language": "en", "text": "As predictable as English downpours are the pools of water I have to sidestep in hospital corridors, caused by the leaking, rickety, 1950s roofs. One flood came from burst internal sewerage pipes. That was infinitely worse. It smelt exactly as you\u2019d expect and caused an entire assessment unit to be closed for weeks. I\u2019ve sat in doctors\u2019 messes infested with cockroaches, and once looked up at the scuttling to find myself face to face with a rat.\n\n'Crumbling' hospitals putting lives at risk, say NHS chiefs Read more\n\nThis is the grim reality of so much NHS real estate. Threadbare, dilapidated, in dire need of refurbishment. Staff struggle to care for their patients these days amid collapsing ceilings, crumbling buildings, broken boilers and unsafe fire cladding. Some 43% of NHS buildings are now more than 30 years old and an astonishing 18% predate the founding of the NHS in 1948. I\u2019ve personally conducted ward rounds in huts that resemble the old codebreakers\u2019 cabins of Bletchley Park. Freezing in winter, sweltering in summer \u2013 hardly a healing environment.\n\nSo you might imagine we\u2019d be positively rejoicing this week at Boris Johnson\u2019s much-hyped announcement of 40 \u201cnew\u201d hospitals for the NHS. If only. Even more infuriating than the revelation that the number of new hospitals was at most only six, was knowing that this apparent largesse came on the back of a systematic, year-on-year degradation of the NHS estate.\n\nFor the last six years, government ministers have deliberately diverted money from the NHS\u2019s capital budget to pay for its day-to-day running costs. It\u2019s like allowing your car brakes to fail so you can keep on buying petrol. It\u2019s not exactly conducive to safety. As a consequence, trusts can no longer afford to repair their threadbare buildings, let alone upgrade them. It\u2019s small wonder NHS hospitals are falling apart when we now spend a mere 0.3% of GDP on health infrastructure, compared to 0.6% in comparable countries.\n\nWith a general election looming, the prime minister is clearly desperate to convince us of his \u201cNHS love\u201d. Presumably he sees chasing votes in marginal seats with the promise of shiny new hospitals as smart electoral practice. But the constituency he neglects \u2013 the one that sees through all the spin \u2013 is the NHS workforce. Yes, basic refurbishments are vital. But state-of-the-art new hospitals? Ask any one of the 1.5 million of us and we\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s people, not bricks and mortar, that the NHS is really crying out for.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Our current shortfall of 40,000 nurses and 10,000 doctors is putting patients at risk in every setting.\u2019 Photograph: Wellcome\n\nI understand that long-term NHS workforce planning isn\u2019t the snazziest electoral bribe on the doorstep, but any politician who truly puts patients first would champion this above anything. Our current shortfall of 40,000 nurses and 10,000 doctors is putting patients at risk in every setting. Whether hospital, GP, ambulance or community, NHS understaffing is endemic.\n\nSo where are Johnson\u2019s workforce upgrades \u2013 the expansions of nursing, doctor and allied health professional training places the NHS so desperately needs? Why won\u2019t he commit to reinstating the vital nurse-training bursary? Why isn\u2019t he commissioning robust NHS-wide research into doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 reasons for quitting, the better to improve staff retention in the future?\n\nAnd why \u2013 above all \u2013 with Brexit looming, is he not guaranteeing settled status for every one of my priceless EU27 colleagues who keep the NHS afloat today? Does the need to neutralise the Brexit party vote really elevate maintaining the hostile environment above patient safety?\n\nThe answer, I can only surmise, as promises of glitzy new health tech are sprayed like Bollinger across the Tory conference hall, is that votes must matter more than patients. A veneer of NHS love \u2013 all these tantalising promises of hospitals, apps and revolutionary genomics dangled before voters like medical baubles \u2013 are the opposite of careful, methodical NHS planning. And they serve only to deaden the morale of overstretched staff for whom working conditions are routinely brutal.\n\nFor me, as temperatures begin to fall across the UK, the starkest framing of our workforce crisis comes from last winter. My friend, a senior A&E doctor, called me one night close to tears. His shift, like so many that January, had required him to scrutinise the patients trapped on the trolleys lining the corridors, trying to deduce who, in the morass of frailty and suffering, was closest to dying. With just one bed free in resus, only the sickest patient would receive the intensive care they needed. Playing God \u2013 knowing full well some of the other patients might die on their trolleys \u2013 nearly drove my friend to quit medicine.\n\nSo forgive me, prime minister, if I don\u2019t applaud your gorgeous new hospitals \u2013 all 40, six or however many there really are of them. But who exactly, in the absence of a comprehensive workforce plan, is going to staff them? Stethoscoped unicorns?\n\n\u2022 Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and author of Your Life in My Hands", "description": "Boris Johnson talks of new hospitals and technology when he should be tackling a crippling staff shortfall, says palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke", "authors": ["Rachel Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1846b5ab250b28a74a1cb136e1522aa6bab044f8/0_183_4712_2827/master/4712.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=16d65aa286f2e5a08d731b09a82fb531"}
