It reminded him of the last time he played in the stadium as a member of the Seattle Seahawks in a playoff game in January 2013, a game that remains infamous among the Redskins\u2019 fan base. Then-rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III suffered a serious knee injury and the stadium\u2019s surface was widely blamed. Sunday\u2019s slop was bad enough to conjure up those images.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Sherman said of Sunday\u2019s conditions, which San Francisco overcame to improve to 6-0. \u201cI\u2019ve played in this stadium once before, in the playoffs, and it was pretty bad. That was the year RG III went down with a knee injury. The field was pretty awful. Mostly sand. It was like playing in a sand pit. Today was rain, and everything was going bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSherman and his defensive teammates woke up to a downpour on Sunday and knew it would fall on them to make plays in what promised to be an ugly game. San Francisco\u2019s defense delivered to end a series of strong Washington drives \u2014 it held to force a missed field goal on Washington\u2019s first drive, stopped the Redskins on a fourth-and-one at the 49ers 28-yard line in the second quarter and stripped Adrian Peterson for a fumble deep inside San Francisco territory in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuses. We have to do better,\u201d Washington quarterback Case Keenum said. \u201cThe conditions were the same for both teams.\u201d\n\nIt was Keenum who was sacked into a puddle of water on the game\u2019s final play by San Francisco defensive end Nick Bosa, who slid across his stomach along with the rest of his teammates in his celebration. \u201cEverybody is a step slower, people can\u2019t make the same cuts or do the exact same things,\u201d Bosa said of the conditions afterward, yet San Francisco appeared to be step ahead of Washington the entire afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven as San Francisco went 0-for-4 in the red zone, kicker Robbie Gould adjusted early in the driving rain to shoulder the scoring load. He missed his first field goal but responded with chip shots of 28, 22 and 29 yards. After that first miss, Gould shortened his step and shortened his approach to strike the ball better, he said.\n\n\u201cToday was one of those days where the first team to put points on the board was going to have the advantage,\u201d Gould said.\n\nThe 49ers offense, which outgained the Redskins 283-154, made plays in the passing game down the stretch behind quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and tight end George Kittle. And the defense mounted relentless pressure on Keenum, who threw just 12 passes and was sacked three times. He rarely tested Sherman and the secondary, who by the end of the game had turned the conditions into their advantage. It was the second time that Sherman had endured difficult conditions at FedEx Field, and it was the second time he walked away a winner.\n\n\u201cI think any grass field with this kind of rain, a torrential downpour the whole game, it\u2019s going to be a rough field,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI know this field\u2019s conditions have been pretty bad, but if it\u2019s raining and it\u2019s grass and dirt, it\u2019s going to turn into mud.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The 49ers cornerback dubbed Sunday's game \"The Mud Bowl,\" and compared it to the 2013 playoff game between Washington and Seattle in which Robert Griffin III injured his knee.", "authors": ["Roman Stubbs", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sNsz4haAT0KRUmcPO-Z0VY89GVM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EY6GRUHTOYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
