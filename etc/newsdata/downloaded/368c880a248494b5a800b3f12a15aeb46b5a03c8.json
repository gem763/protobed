So I took a heck of a lot of persuading when my partner suggested a holiday in Bali \u2013 with 16-plus hours of flying in order to get there. Balinese massage, with its long, flowing strokes and gentle stretching moves, is a well-known fix for nerve-pain conditions.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nHoshinoya Bali resort village is a 15-minute drive from touristy Ubud, perched dramatically on the edge of a steep valley, overlooking lush rainforest. It\u2019s an all-villa hotel, and each \u2018hut\u2019 sits on the edge of pools that run, like canals, through the site. The standout experience is breakfast in the couch-lined \u2018birdcages\u2019 that jut out over the hillside, giving the feeling that you\u2019re hanging amid the treetops.\n\nTHE TREATMENT\n\nThe spa is accessed via a lift that descends through the rainforest to a secluded villa.\n\nYou can hear the lulling sound of the river rushing through the valley below. I choose the Spice Body Revitalising treatment (120mins, \u00a3110), which involves a Balinese oil massage, body scrub, wrap and then a herbal bath.\n\nBalinese massage is far gentler than other Asian styles, such as Thai, Japanese Shiatsu and Chinese Tui Na, all of which either involve deep back-bending stretches or wince-inducing pressure. You\u2019re still pulled and pushed but, on the whole, when feeling fragile it seems like a more safe bet.\n\nThe flight had left my back in tatters and the area above my left buttock totally numb, but afterwards I felt loose and, thanks to some moves where my legs were gently manipulated, my numb areas regained consciousness. The bath, at the end, overlooking the rainforest while sipping tea, was a magical finishing touch.", "description": "SPA DOCTOR: Sciatica\u00a0is a pain in the backside at the best of times.
