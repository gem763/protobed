He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn\u2019t participate in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFox News said on Wednesday that Gowdy would no longer contribute to its programs after joining Trump\u2019s impeachment defense.\n\n\u201cTrey Gowdy has been terminated and is no longer a contributor,\u201d a spokesperson for the network said in an e-mail.\n\nGowdy will act as outside counsel in the impeachment battle, working with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nGowdy rose to prominence leading a special House panel investigating the attacks on an American diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, while Hillary Clinton was secretary of State. The committee\u2019s more than two-year-long investigation concluded in June 2016, in the thick of the presidential campaign, without substantiating any criminal behavior or misconduct by Obama administration officials. The probe was derided by Democrats as a political stunt intended to damage Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nAs a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Gowdy also helped manage the panel\u2019s investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2012, during another investigation by the Republican-led House, the Obama administration invoked executive privilege for documents and over subpoenas.\n\nGowdy, according to a Voice of America article, responded that \u201cthe notion that you can withhold information and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in power or not in power is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.\u201d\n\nEarly last year, Gowdy announced that he would not seek re-election to his South Carolina House seat. \u201cWhatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,\u201d he said at the time.\n\n(Updates with Fox termination in third paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Joshua Gallu\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White", "authors": ["Jennifer Jacobs"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PksDmmdeGbYU54ogwN502A--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0ac7e6ed29343e18028654b123cc7a13", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
