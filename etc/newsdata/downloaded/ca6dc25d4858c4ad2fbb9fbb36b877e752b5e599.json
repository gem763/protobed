(Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nIn late 2017, the New York Times received an urgent warning from a U.S. official. Egyptian authorities were looking to arrest Declan Walsh, the newspaper\u2019s reporter in Cairo, according to its publisher. It\u2019s not unusual for a large media organization to get tipped off about threats to its journalists overseas, particularly those reporting on authoritarian governments.\n\nBut what was striking is what the official said next: The Trump administration had tried to keep the warning about Walsh from ever reaching the Times. Officials \u201cintended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out,\u201d Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger wrote in an opinion column on Monday.\n\nThis incident, described publicly by Sulzberger for the first time in a talk at Brown University earlier on Monday, adds a chilling new episode to the administration\u2019s trend of attacking the press and diminishing the rights of journalists as they come under threat around the globe, the publisher wrote.\n\nWhere the United States was once seen as the top defender of press freedom, Sulzberger suggested Trump has inspired the opposite around the globe, citing recent threats made in an address by the Cambodian prime minister, a social media blackout in Chad, and attempts to arrest foreign journalists in Egypt, whose autocratic president Trump once jokingly called his \u201cfavorite dictator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese brutal crackdowns are being passively accepted and perhaps even tacitly encouraged by the president of the United States,\u201d Sulzberger said.\n\nPresident Trump has refused to acknowledge that the Saudi government ordered the assassination of The Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, as international investigators have found. And the president\u2019s frequent use of the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d has resulted in more than 50 foreign government leaders to adopt similar calls, the publisher charged.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWalsh, The Times\u2019s Cairo bureau chief, penned articles in early 2017 about the country\u2019s crackdown on human rights groups, the expulsion of a prominent critic of Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and the largely ineffective efforts to hold the country\u2019s former president Hosni Mubarak accountable. He also led a live Web event from Cairo in March 2017 about the tight press restrictions placed on visual journalists in Egypt.\n\nLater that year, the Times got a call from the U.S. official, who said Walsh had a target on his back. That\u2019s when the call took a \u201csurprising and distressing turn,\u201d Sulzberger wrote on Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration wanted to sit on the warning and let Egyptian officials carry out the arrest, the official said. In fact, the official feared being punished for alerting the Times of what was about to play out.\n\nSo the newspaper instead turned to Walsh\u2019s home country of Ireland for help. Almost immediately, officials from the Irish Embassy in Cairo escorted the journalist from his home to the airport, Sulzberger wrote.\n\nThe Irish Embassy in Cairo referred a request for comment to the Irish Foreign Ministry, which did not immediately return multiple calls and emails. Walsh also did not immediately respond to messages.\n\nIn his talk at Brown, Sulzberger used the incident to illustrate the repercussions of Trump\u2019s failure to defend press freedom around the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sounding the alarm because his words are dangerous and having real-world consequences around the globe,\u201d Sulzberger said.\n\nReporters Without Borders, a nonprofit that fights for press freedom, has noted a sharp drop in the number of countries where it is safe for journalists to work. Only 8 percent of 180 countries evaluated by the organization in 2019 have a media climate considered \u201cgood\u201d for journalists, amid a tightening grip from government and increased violence. The United States came in at 48th, and Egypt was 163rd.\n\nLater in his speech, Sulzberger mentioned an incident in February, in which another one of the newspaper\u2019s journalists was targeted by the Egyptian government. This time, the Egyptians\u2019 efforts were successful.\n\nDavid D. Kirkpatrick, a Times international correspondent and former Cairo bureau chief, had written a book, \u201cInto the Hands of the Soldiers,\u201d that was critical of the Egyptian government. Upon landing in Cairo in February, Kirkpatrick was placed in custody for hours without food or water. He was then ordered on a flight back to London, where he is based.\n\n[In latest blow to press freedom, Egypt bars, then deports New York Times reporter]\n\nSam Werberg, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, later said the office was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the incident and raised the matter with Egyptian officials.\n\nPrivately, however, the embassy\u2019s reaction to the incident seemed to differ. After the Times\u2019s leadership spoke out, Sulzberger heard from a senior official at the embassy.\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect would happen to him?\u201d the official said, according to Sulzberger. \u201cHis reporting made the government look bad.\u201d\n\nSulzberger\u2019s column prompted one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics in Congress to compare the president to an \u201cauthoritarian.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what authoritarians do,\u201d tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).", "description": "The incident adds a chilling episode to the administration\u2019s trend of diminishing the rights of journalists instead of defending them as they come under threat around the globe.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Teo Armus Is A Reporter On The Post'S Morning Mix Team.
