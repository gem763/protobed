Earlier this week, he told POLITICO he was approached in November by a private investigator claiming to have information on Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, but he declined to name the investigator or the investigator\u2019s source.\n\nUkrainian officials have denied interfering in the 2016 election, a subject of intense interest for President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly accused the Ukrainian government of colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, based in part on a 2017 POLITICO report about actions by Ukrainian officials that benefited Clinton.\n\nBut the investigator\u2019s source claimed to have more information about the Ukrainians\u2019 role in the 2016 campaign, including the creation of a dossier by British ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele and covering up election-related hacking, according to Giuliani.\n\nLev Parnas, a Soviet-born, Florida-based businessman who aided Giuliani\u2019s efforts, said the investigator approached Giuliani and Parnas with the tip while the pair were eating lunch, according to a story published Wednesday in The Washington Post.\n\nBut Giuliani says that version of events is \u201ctotally wrong.\u201d The investigator called him, rather than approaching him in person, he said. And according to the former New York mayor, the approach happened two months before he began working with Parnas. He added that Parnas does not even know the identity of the private investigator. \u201cLev has no idea,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nA lawyer for Parnas, John Dowd, acknowledged receipt of questions about the discrepancies but did not respond with answers.\n\nOver the course of an hourlong interview on Wednesday, Giuliani also offered additional details about the origins of his Ukraine-related sleuthing efforts. He said that the call from the unnamed private investigator \u2014 a former assistant U.S. attorney he worked with in the Southern District of New York \u2014 came sometime in November before the 29th, when he met in person for the first time with the investigator.\n\nAfter being told the identity of the investigator\u2019s source, Giuliani said he consulted with a former State Department official, a former CIA official, and an American rabbi, all of whom, he said, vouched for the source\u2019s credibility. Giuliani, who previously told POLITICO he had known the source vaguely years ago, said the investigator\u2019s source is an American of Ukrainian descent.\n\nGiuliani said he did not begin working with Parnas until January.\n\nHe also said he spoke with Viktor Shokin, a Ukrainian former prosecutor general fired at Joe Biden\u2019s urging, by video chat for the first and only time on Jan. 23. That timeline contradicts previous reporting and the whistleblower complaint of an intelligence officer, which places the Giuliani-Shokin call in late 2018.\n\nBut Giuliani decried the focus on the details of his efforts, saying scrutiny should instead be falling on Joe and Hunter Biden, whose activities in Ukraine he has repeatedly claimed are corrupt, despite a lack of evidence that Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in the country influenced his father\u2019s official actions.\n\n\u201cWhen you start asking me about petty little facts,\u201d Giuliani said, \u201cI start to worry you're burying the lead.\u201d\n\nKatya Gorchinskaya contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/36/33/f3bb295c45df91ee8733699e8f48/191003-rudy-giuliani-gty-773.jpg"}
