All preparations for the operation have been completed,\u201d the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter early on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to establish a safe zone/peace corridor to contribute to our region\u2019s peace and stability, and for Syrians to achieve a safe life,\u201d it said.\n\nTurkey does not appear \u201cas of now\u201d to have begun its expected incursion into northern Syria, a senior Trump administration official said on Monday.\n\nA Reuters witness said there was no sign of military activity on Tuesday near the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad. Howitzers were positioned behind earth embankments on the Turkish side of the border, pointed towards Syria.\n\nU.S. forces evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain on Monday, a U.S. official said.\n\nTrump\u2019s warning on Turkey\u2019s economy appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rebuke from some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!)\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cRED FLAG\u201d\n\nHis remarks met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener who said it was a day to put aside domestic politics.\n\n\u201cThreatening Turkey\u2019s economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,\u201d she told her party\u2019s lawmakers in a speech in parliament. \u201cToday there is only one party and that is our red (Turkish) flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor,\u201d she added.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks about Turkey and Syria during a formal signing ceremony for the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement at the White House in Washington, October 7, 2019.
