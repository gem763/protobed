In response, Saudi Arabia, Russia and more than 30 other countries wrote a rival letter that commended China's rights record.\n\nAsked by Reuters last month if US criticism of China's policies on Xinjiang and Hong Kong political protests could affect trade talks, China's state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi, said: \"We hope trade talks can have a loose and good foreign environment.\"\n\nChina met some foreign envoys before the latest session of the UN General Assembly in New York, which began last month.\n\nChinese human rights academics also defended Beijing's policies in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong during a briefing with reporters at China's UN mission in New York last week.\n\nThe US led more than 30 countries at an event on the sidelines of the annual UN gathering of world leaders last month in condemning what it called China's \"horrific campaign of repression\" against Muslims in Xinjiang.
