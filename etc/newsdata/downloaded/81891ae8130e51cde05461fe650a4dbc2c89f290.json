Ebony was asleep, but Lydia had awoken and was crying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I picked Lydia up out of her cot and sat on the bed and gave her another feed and I put her back into the cot.\n\n\u2018After putting her into the cot, she started to cry, so I picked her up out of the cot and put her into the bed in between myself and Ebony.\n\nLydia was rushed to Royal Stoke University hospital, but pronounced dead by doctors on September 27, 2016 (\n\n\u2018I was sat up playing games on my phone and I was going to put Lydia back in her cot.\n\n\u2018At 4am, Lydia started to cry, but then fell asleep again. At 4.30am, a notification came through on my phone and that is the last time I can recall and I fell asleep.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what time it was, but I was woken by Ebony screaming and I saw Ebony cradling Lydia in her arms and she looked lifeless.\n\n\u2018Ebony was crying and I ran to the reception to get help.\n\n\u2018I must have laid on Lydia as there is no other explanation. I\u2019m a big man, I weigh 18 stone and I\u2019m 5ft 11. I must have rolled over during the night.\u2019\n\nIn her police interview, Lydia\u2019s mum Ebony-Jade Pearson said she woke up to her \u2018blue and pale\u2019 daughter and tried to save her life.\n\nShe said: \u2018Lydia was born on September 3, 2016. I don\u2019t drink alcohol, I do smoke and I smoked five cigarettes a day through pregnancy.\n\n\u2018Me and Tom both smoke cannabis and I\u2019ve smoked it three times since bringing Lydia home and the last time was three days ago. But we never smoked inside the flat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018On September 23, I thought she had a cold and she was prescribed some nasal drops.\n\n\u2018On September 26, Lydia was put in her cot at 7.30pm and she woke at 10pm for a feed and I went to bed at 11pm and Tom stayed up.\n\n\u2018Lydia woke me at about 3am crying and Tom fed her sitting up in bed.\n\n\u2018I woke up and thought it was unusual that Lydia hadn\u2019t woken me up. I then realised that Lydia was in the bed to my right.\n\n\u2018Lydia was on her right side and was facing Tom in the bed who was on his right side sleeping facing away from me and Lydia was pushed into his back.\n\n\u2018I pulled Lydia up and she was blue and pale. I tried to wake Tom up, telling him that he was squashing her, and I sent him for help and I laid Lydia down on the bed.\n\n\u2018I gave her two breaths and then the ambulance attended.\u2019\n\nChildren who bite others at nursery given 'bite box' to distract them\n\nThe pathologist, Dr Roger Malcomson, who conducted the post-mortem into Lydia\u2019s death, concluded there was insufficient evidence to say that Lydia\u2019s death was caused by asphyxiation.\n\nHowever, he highlighted the risks that come with co-sleeping and gave a cause of death as unascertained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018A young baby sleeping with parents is not a safe sleeping environment.\n\n\u2018What has been stated by the parents may be true, but I haven\u2019t seen any contributory evidence in post-mortem sufficient to confirm it as a cause of death.\u2019\n\nAssistant coroner Sarah Murphy recorded a narrative conclusion, saying: \u2018Lydia was found unresponsive in her parents\u2019 bed and her face was in close proximity to her father\u2019s back.\n\n\u2018There is insufficient evidence to establish to the required standard the death was as a result of over laying or causing accidental obstruction of the air ways.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
