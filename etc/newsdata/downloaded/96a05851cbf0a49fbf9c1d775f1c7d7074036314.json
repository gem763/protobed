Police will run checks if any of them had criminal history, another official said.\n\nINM said the deportees had been scattered in eight states around Mexico, including in southern Mexico from where many Indian migrants enter the country, hoping to transit to the US border.\n\nThe backlog of migrants in southern Mexico has grown as officials have stopped issuing permits for them to cross the country, said Caitlyn Yates, a research coordinator at IBI Consultants who has studied increasing numbers of US-bound Asian and African migrants arriving in Mexico.\n\n\"This type of deportation in Mexico is the first of its kind but likely to continue,\" Yates said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The 310 men and one woman were flown out of Mexico on a chartered flight that arrived in New Delhi on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/be7dec1c9d224676a261f2d7f2944be5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
