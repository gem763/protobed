His name, still visible, is marked in pen on its interior.\n\nAlthough there was no bang when the pin from the \u201cHoly Hand Grenade of Antioch\u201d was removed, sellers hope for an explosion of interest in the \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail\u201d piece as the British comedy celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.\n\n\u201cIn true Monty Python style, this is actually built from a ballcock from a toilet system,\u201d said Stephen Lane, of the Prop Store, which is organising the auction.\n\nProp Store have put around 250 of the 900 lots on display at the BFI Imax building in Waterloo, south London, where the auction will be held.\n\nFans of the latest outing of Joker might be in for a surprise with the more jovial multi-coloured costume on display from Jack Nicholson\u2019s turn as the character in \u201cBatman\u201d. The particular shade of purple was chosen by Nicholson himself to match that of the L.A. Lakers basketball team, Lane said.\n\nThe two-day auction is set for Sept. 30 to Oct. 1, with the public free to view the lots until then.", "description": "Jurassic Park dinosaur skulls, a Star Wars stormtrooper helmet and Monty Python's holy hand grenade are among movie memorabilia going under the hammer in London this month at an auction organisers expect to exceed 6 million pounds ($7.5 million).", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431300513&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1IJ", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
