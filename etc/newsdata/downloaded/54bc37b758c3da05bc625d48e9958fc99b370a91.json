Yovanovitch from Kiev as an egregious abuse of the system by allies of Mr. Trump who were seeking to remove a perceived obstacle, according to a person familiar with Ms. Hill\u2019s account.\n\nThe removal of Ms. Yovanovitch has emerged as a key episode in the narrative under examination by the House as part of its impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump. A career diplomat, Ms. Yovanovitch was targeted by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and other allies who were seeking to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals.", "description": "With Congress returning from a two-week break, the pace of the House impeachment inquiry is likely to pick up with the questioning of key witnesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/us/politics/14dc-impeachbriefing/14dc-impeachbriefing-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
