This, on the face of it, is what emerged from two sets of figures published last week.\n\n\n\nThe first report, from the Council of Mortgage Lenders, painted a grim picture of young homebuyers\u2019 dependency on parental help to raise a deposit.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, before the financial crisis, two-thirds of first-time buyers managed their purchase without parental help, putting down an average of ten per cent.\n\n\n\nGrandparents' help: The property alone owned by over-65s is worth \u00a3770billion, report says\n\nToday the proportion of first-timers who don\u2019t need to turn to the Bank of Mum and Dad has plunged to nearer one third, partly because banks require bigger deposits, typically 20 per cent of the property\u2019s value. The number of these buyers has also crashed, from 400,000 in 2006 to less than 220,000 in 2012.\n\n\n\nThe Council\u2019s report went on to suggest that parental support was now reaching its limits, as people in their 40s and 50s had their own financial needs \u2013 including paying off mortgages and building pensions.\n\nThe second report, from specialist lender Key Retirement Solutions, was a brighter snapshot of rising affluence among another group: property-owning pensioners. Almost five million pensioners own their homes outright.\n\n\n\nThe property alone owned by over-65s is worth \u00a3770billion \u2013 up by more than \u00a31billion since January, thanks to the house-price recovery.\n\n\n\nIn a week when Labour sparked controversy by suggesting winter fuel payments for wealthy pensioners should be scrapped, these figures will be seized on by many as another sign of Britain\u2019s growing inter-generational financial divide.\n\nInvestors about to get a better deal on fund charges thanks to Hargreaves Lansdowne's weight\n\n\n\nA revolution is under way at the biggest investment broker Hargreaves Lansdown and its 470,000 customers will benefit. Most use Hargreaves to invest in funds run by household names such as Jupiter, Invesco or M&G.\n\nNow, thanks to sweeping new rules, Hargreaves has written to these fund companies demanding they reduce their charges.\n\n\n\nThey have a few weeks to reply. Such is the influence of Hargreaves Lansdown, most recipients of the letters, which The Mail on Sunday has seen, will do as required.\n\n\n\nUltimately it should mean private investors pay less to invest and enjoy higher returns. The revolution has come about because the previous City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, banned the payment of secret commissions between fund companies and brokers such as Hargreaves.\n\n\n\nThe MoS has been foremost in campaigning for this ban over many years and in the face of much resistance. The greatest opposition to our campaign came from Peter Hargreaves, the man who founded the broker firm that bears his name and who has made a fortune of more than \u00a31billion through it.\n\nA few years ago in one of several heated exchanges, he admitted to me that not only did his customers not know how much they were paying him, but many believed they were not paying at all. I found that shocking. It explained why there was scant competition: how could there be, if consumers had no idea what they paid?\n\nIt also explained why firms like his were so super-profitable. The situation has changed with the arrival of the new rules, and the firm insists it now discloses commissions. But several years ago, at the time of my dispute with Peter Hargreaves, the watchdog must have shared our view, because the slow process of forcing companies to disclose charges and commissions was set in motion.\n\n\n\nThe new rules are only just coming into effect. Peter Hargreaves\u2019 implacable hostility to the regulations \u2013 he contested them every step of the way \u2013 now seems greedy as well as ill-judged. The status quo he bitterly sought to protect was not a system where private investors\u2019 interests came first.\n\nInstead, his interests were more closely aligned with the fund companies whose investments he promoted in return for cheques written behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nSmall investors, left in the dark, simply paid up, possibly believing they were getting an excellent deal. From now, they should do better.\n\n\n\nThe letter today on the desks of fund groups around the City and elsewhere, in which Hargreaves Lansdown (no longer managed by Peter Hargreaves) demands improved rates for its customers, is proof allegiances are shifting. Private investors\u2019 interests are rightly to the fore.\n\n", "description": "The Bank of Mum and Dad is going bust, but the Bank of Gran and Grandad is flush with property wealth, a further sign of the great generational divide.", "authors": ["Richard Dyson For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
