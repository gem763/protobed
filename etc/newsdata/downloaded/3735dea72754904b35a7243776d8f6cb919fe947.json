(Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\n\nThe 33-year-old Rafael Nadal outlasted Daniil Medvedev in a five-set U.S. Open final Sunday night, 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4.\n\nAfter four hours and 51 minutes of thrilling back-and-forth action, Nadal won his fourth U.S. Open title and 19th major singles title. Medvedev made history in his own right, winning the third and fourth sets in his first major final to push Nadal to the brink.\n\nBut he could not deny a surging Nadal, who brought the New York crowd to its feet multiple times after long, grueling rallies in the night\u2019s final set. As Medvedev\u2019s return went long on match point, Nadal collapsed on his back, arms and legs spread wide. Taking off his headband he got up and hugged the 23-year old Russian before burying his face in his sweat-soaked shirt and then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal, who was playing in his 27th Grand Slam final Sunday, is now one shy of Roger Federer\u2019s 20 record major titles.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated.\n\n\n\nRafael Nadal celebrates his victory.

He wins a second straight game with his back against the wall to force Nadal to serve for the championship once again.\n\nFifth set: Nadal up, 5-3\n\nIn what could be the turning point of the match, Nadal breaks Medvedev in the fifth game, coming back from love-40 after a 28-shot rally to go up a break in the fifth set. Fans, who were continuously behind Medvedev as he rallied in the third and fourth sets, are now voicing their support for Nadal, who seems to have mustered a final surge of energy. He holds serve to go up 4-2, and then breaks Medvedev again to go up 5-2, until Medvedev breaks back as Nadal was called for another time violation. Both players are gritting this one out, with the crowd constantly chanting Nadal\u2019s name.\n\nFifth set: Medvedev up, 2-1\n\nPassing the four-hour mark in a tactically brilliant match by both players, Medvedev, who has never won a match in five sets, has somehow kept pace with a fatigued Nadal. The Spaniard was dinged for his second time violation of the match during the second game of the fifth set, but he was able to win the necessary point on a second serve. Medvedev is attempting to become the first man to come from two sets down to win a U.S. Open final since 1949.\n\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev won the third and fourth sets. (Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\n\nFourth set: Medvedev wins, 6-4\n\nNadal appeared in total control of his service games until Medvedev broke to win the fourth set and force this Grand Slam final to go the distance. In a match in which it looked like Nadal had seized control after winning the first two sets, Medvedev now has the momentum \u2014 and, surprisingly, the crowd \u2014 on his side. Trainers looked at Medvedev\u2019s upper thighs before the fifth set of a match that began about four hours ago.\n\nFourth set: Medvedev up, 5-4\n\nAfter Nadal holds at love, Medvedev answers the easy service game with one of his own to move within a game of claiming the fourth set. Now Nadal will look to hold to stay in the fourth set by holding serve one more time.\n\nFourth set: Medvedev up, 3-2\n\nAnother gutsy hold by Medvedev, saving a break point. Medvedev ultimately holds after a Nadal forehand error and things are starting to get tense at Arthur Ashe Stadium, as the match nears the four-hour mark.\n\n\n\nRafael Nadal gradually lost his lead over the younger challenger. (Charles Krupa/AP)\n\nThe crowd comes alive\n\nAfter Medvedev walked onto the court to scattered boos from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the crowd has now rallied behind the \u201ctournament villain\u201d with rousing applause throughout the third set for a man who had been jeered earlier in the tournament. Pushing into the fourth set after receiving a standing ovation, the youngster is being urged on by the crowd as he leads 1-0 early in the fourth.\n\nThird set: Medvedev wins, 7-5, trails two sets to one\n\nDon\u2019t look now but Daniil Medvedev just won the third set with a remarkable series of rallies and a dramatic break of serve. He became only the second man currently under the age of 30 to win a set in a Grand Slam final. Nadal had multiple chances to pull away after going up a break early in the set, but he failed to close the younger man out. Medvedev has never won a match after being two sets down.\n\nNot done yet! \ud83d\udcaa@DaniilMedwed breaks Nadal in the 12th game to claim the 3rd set!#USOpen pic.twitter.com/4t9bFuKvdV \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 8, 2019\n\nThird set: Medvedev up, 6-5\n\nAfter going up a break early in the set, Nadal now must hold serve to stay in the third set. With the rallies getting longer and longer as this set drags on, fatigue and physical exhaustion look to be playing a factor for both men. And the New York crowd, which booed Medvedev earlier in the tournament, is now rallying behind him and chanting his name.\n\nThird set: Medvedev leads, 4-3\n\nBig cheers from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium after Medvedev breaks Nadal back to even the third set. The Russian isn\u2019t done yet, holding serve to take a 4-3 lead, with the set back on serve.\n\nThird set: Nadal up, 3-2\n\nAfter winning the first two sets, Nadal breaks in the fifth game of the third set and the path is clearing for his 19th Grand Slam title. On break point, Medvedev couldn\u2019t return a strong backhand from Nadal, the youngster\u2019s 32nd unforced error of the match.\n\nThird set: Medvedev up, 2-1\n\nMedvedev is continuing to push Nadal, recording a rare love hold in the third game of the third set. He finished off the game with a 119 mph ace. The third set remains on serve.\n\nSecond set: Nadal wins, 6-3, leads two sets to none\n\nRafael Nadal is now one set away from winning his fourth U.S. Open title after beating Medvedev in 48 minutes in the second set. The Spaniard has a 208-1 record in majors when winning the first two sets. Medvedev looked tired early in the second set, and despite testing Nadal in the ninth game, couldn\u2019t record a break. The young Russian will have a long uphill climb to win his first major final.\n\nSecond set: Nadal leads, 4-2\n\nNadal breaks serve with a deep return, and he now looks to be in control of the match. Medvedev is switching rackets for the next game, and Nadal has visibly started to wear the young Russian down. The Spaniard seems to have the first-time finalist right where he wants him, and now he\u2019s closing in on the second set.\n\n\n\nNadal has had every shot in the final. (Brian Hirschfeld/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nSecond set: Nadal up, 2-1\n\nMedvedev is really making Nadal work for every point here in the second set, and the youngster shows no signs of going away. With better serves, Nadal was able to hold at 30 after he had two well-placed serves \u2014 one down the line and the other out wide. His first serve percentage, poor early, is now up to 54 percent. The second set remains on serve.\n\nFirst set: Nadal wins, 7-5\n\nAfter an hour and three minutes, Nadal grinds out the first set. It\u2019s been a gritty back-and-forth battle, and Medvedev, new to this stage, will look to recover in the second set. Nadal had a run of 14 consecutive service points in the first set as he settled in after a rocky start. Medvedev fell behind repeatedly in the set\u2019s final game, rallying before Nadal won an 18-stroke rally to break serve and claim the set.\n\nFirst set: Nadal up, 5-4\n\nDespite Nadal\u2019s uncharacteristically poor first-serve percentage, he has stayed ahead by not allowing Medvedev to get into any sort of rhythm. With Nadal getting back on serve after an early break, the crowd has started to get into the match, applauding Nadal\u2019s shot-making abilities against Medvedev, who had a strong hold in the eighth game.\n\nFirst set: Medvedev leads, 2-1\n\nA solid start for Medvedev, getting the match\u2019s first break of the serve in the third game. After Nadal took the first game, Medvedev came roaring back, pushing away any nerves from appearing in his first major final and taking the following two games. Nadal was issued a time violation while serving in the first game, and nearly had another in the third. The U.S. Open announced in 2018 it would enforce tennis\u2019s time rules via a 25-second \u201cserve clock.\u201d\n\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev of Russia in his first major final. (Timothy A.
