REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nBut as the Softbank-backed (9984.T) startup pushes toward profitability, an increasing number of Indian hotel operators who have partnered with it are complaining about being blindsided by fee increases.\n\nThe backlash against Oyo - while limited to a small share of the more than 10,000 hotel owners in India who work with it - comes at a crucial time for an emerging-market unicorn valued at $10 billion and its major investor.\n\nSoftbank, which has invested nearly $1 billion in Oyo, through its Vision Fund, is struggling to raise funding for a second investment fund in the wake of the failed offering of office-rental company WeWork and amid questions about the path to profitability of other marquee investments like Uber (UBER.N).. Oyo has not yet turned a profit.\n\nIn the background of the discontent is the disruption Oyo has brought to India\u2019s lodging market \u2013 often to the delight of India\u2019s middle-class travelers and to the dismay of hotel owners who have seen room rates driven down at a time when economic growth has slowed.\n\nOyo charges hotels a roughly 20% franchise fee on room revenues when hotels join its network, but some Indian hotel operators say the startup often ends up taking half or more of revenues through fees that were not initially disclosed.\n\nA group representing hotel operators in Bengaluru called for a criminal probe into Oyo last month, saying the company was withholding money because of unfair fee increases.\n\nTwo hoteliers in the southern state of Karnataka filed separate police complaints last month accusing Oyo of deceitfully increasing commissions, and accusing Oyo\u2019s 25-year-old founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal of fraud.\n\nAgarwal successfully appealed to the Karnataka High Court for a stay order on one case in Bengaluru, the court website shows, and a police official said the order barred police from investigating.\n\nIn the other complaint, in the town of Chikkamagaluru, police are investigating, an official there said.\n\nOyo has denied the allegations and said Agarwal declined comment on the legal complaint. The company said it operates with a high level of \u201cintegrity, transparency and commitment\u201d with its partners.\n\nAgarwal said hotel operators who have raised complaints represent a tiny fraction of Oyo\u2019s network and were seeking to drive prices higher at the expense of consumers.\n\n\u201cOn an annual basis, Oyo is able to retain 99% of its asset owners. If, for instance, people were unhappy, our retention rate would have been lower,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nSoftbank, which owns a roughly 45% stake in Oyo, declined to comment.\n\n\u2018PLATFORM FEE\u2019 AND \u2018VISIBILITY BOOST\u2019\n\nOyo says it is in constant contact with its hotel partners. \u201cWe have always disclosed any changes applicable to contracts with asset owners,\u201d Oyo said in a statement.\n\nFor their part, owners and managers say Oyo has introduced fees - including a \u201cplatform fee\u201d and a fee for a \u201cvisibility boost\u201d - which they only discovered in monthly statements.\n\nReuters interviews with 22 hotel owners and managers who run hotels under the Oyo brand in 10 Indian cities suggest the discontent has grown since late last year.\n\nSeveral hotel groups have organized protests. Amitabh Mohapatra, head of one such group in northern India, says over 300 hotels have quit Oyo\u2019s India network this year, while Kunal Rajpara, who heads another group in western India, said a few dozen hoteliers from Ahmedabad ditched Oyo last month.\n\n\u201cThe situation with Oyo has gone from bad to worse,\u201d said P.C. Rao, president of the Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association. \u201cWe want to make sure the business of small hoteliers isn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nSome hotel operators say Oyo continued to list their properties on its mobile app with a \u201csold out\u201d banner after they asked Oyo to sever ties.\n\nThree hotel operators in Ahmedabad said they had e-mailed Oyo representatives on Sept. 23, asking to be removed from the platform but received no response. Reuters found all their properties still listed on Oyo\u2019s app with \u201csold out\u201d messages even though the hotels had rooms available.\n\nOyo says once a hotel has served a 30-day notice period and accounts are settled, the property is typically delisted within 72 hours. It tags all properties serving their notice period that may deny check-ins to customers as \u201csold out\u201d, the company said.\n\n\u2018IT ISN\u2019T SOMETHING OYO CAN IGNORE\u2019\n\nFounded in 2013, Oyo started by aggregating bookings for India\u2019s budget hotels, promising a standard of service in a market where that was more often the exception. Oyo has expanded to China, Europe and the United States, calling itself the world\u2019s fastest growing hotel chain.\n\nMany hotel owners in India were upbeat when Oyo gave properties in smaller cities visibility but began to raise concerns when profits failed to improve, said Darshini Kansara, a hospitality industry analyst at CARE Ratings in Mumbai.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t something Oyo can ignore as they look to capture more market share.\u201d\n\nBased in Gurugram, near New Delhi, Oyo signs up hotels as franchisees by rebranding them and upgrading amenities and then charges fees from the owners.\n\nOyo says hotels are updated on any new contract terms on a tablet-device at the hotel that Oyo provides to manage bookings.\n\nA sign against Oyo is seen outside a hotel in New Delhi, India, August 7, 2019. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nBut some hotel owners say the devices are operated by junior staff, leaving them in the dark until fees have been charged. Ashraf Ali, a hotelier in Mumbai, said a notification offering new terms would keep showing up on the tablets until the hotel employee hit accept.\n\nBengaluru hotelier Vikrant Singh says his 50-room hotel swung from making monthly profits of nearly $7,000 in late 2016 to a loss of more than $2,000 this January. He blames Oyo for the reversal.\n\n\u201cOur profits went down due to the high commissions Oyo was charging,\u201d said Singh, who withdrew his hotel from Oyo in March.", "description": "India's Oyo Hotels and Homes shot out of nowhere to become one of the world's largest hotel chains with a simple promise of \"hassle-free\" online booking, transparent pricing and cheerful lodging.", "authors": ["Sachin Ravikumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437927961&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96059", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
