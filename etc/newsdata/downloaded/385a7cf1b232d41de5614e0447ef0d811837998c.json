I\u2019m spoiled \u2013 I get everything I want, anytime I want it.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have to worry about having issues with in-laws, as all my in laws are my blood family.\u2019\n\nErin will wed Richard next year in their home state of Colorado.

Our personality traits are almost identical and it makes things extremely easy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s really like looking into a mirror and dating myself\n\n\u2018Getting along is a breeze. I know him without even having to know him.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t grow up with him, its like our history is the same, everybody we know is the same.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re connected. We don\u2019t have to start from ground zero and work up like other relationships, we already have a bond there, a history there.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s much easier than normal relationships\u2019", "description": "Digital artist Erin highlighted an unusual benefit to marrying first-cousin Richard, who she is set to wed next year.
