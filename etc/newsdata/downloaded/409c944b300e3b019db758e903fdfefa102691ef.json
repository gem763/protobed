Forcing unisex toilets on primary schools is misguided, unethical, and dangerous to children\u2019s welfare.\n\nWe don\u2019t know why Deansfield Primary School decided to change every toilet in the school to unisex. What we do know is that their disproportionate and expensive response, delivered without consultation with the parents, has created a new problem; children are afraid to use poorly-designed toilets out of fear.\n\nIf this were a one-off, isolated incident then I\u2019d be prepared to chalk it up to a poor judgment call. But it isn\u2019t. This kind of thing is happening across the Western world. It\u2019s not even the only unisex bathroom story I\u2019ve seen in the UK today, there\u2019s a similar one about students at Sheffield University, and just a few days ago it was the Old Vic Theatre. The week before, with a typical politically-correct penchant for hyperbole, Plymouth University called such toilets \u2018life-saving.\u2019\n\nAlso on rt.com Forced to use transgender pronouns: Doctor speaks out after tribunal rules Bible \u2018incompatible with human dignity\u2019\n\nBody-consciousness is important to primary school children, and rightly so. We teach them that because we want to make sure that they\u2019re safe from would-be abusers. Having taught them about the importance of privacy, what an incredible mixed signal we send if we deny them that privacy, and require boys and girls to share toilet facilities.\n\nAny teacher is (rightly) concerned about entering toilets. It\u2019s the one place in a school where a teacher is naturally inclined to stay away, a place where children have the most privacy away from teachers. Consequently, it\u2019s also a place where standards of behaviour can slip. Pupils feel they can get away with more, away from the eyes of teachers.\n\nThe added problem in this case is that the cubicles in this case don\u2019t actually provide privacy, allowing children to look over and/or under doors, no wonder some children are refusing to use the toilets at school, and imagine the other health issues that could occur as a result.\n\nThere is no reasonable means of protest. Girls concerned about being victims of what we would (as adults) describe as voyeurism, even if the intent is not there by that age, can\u2019t go elsewhere. They have no choice.\n\nThere\u2019s a distinction between fault and responsibility, if a serious incident occurs against one of the girls at that school, it will be entirely the fault of the person who commits it. Yet, the school has a responsibility to protect its children, and it is failing in that basic duty of care.\n\nNow let\u2019s be charitable. Let\u2019s suppose that the school had a sensible reason for wanting to make a change. Perhaps a child was being bullied for being or looking \u2018different\u2019 to their classmates. In such situations, there are so many easier ways of dealing with it.\n\nHaving a toilet which anybody is allowed to use would resolve the issue. When a problem presents itself, the appropriate response is to make the simplest, least intrusive change. It avoids causing disruption, and (in a time of overstretched school budgets) it\u2019s cheaper. Instead, they\u2019ve created a much bigger consequence, children who no longer feel safe to go to the toilet at school.\n\nHardly anyone ever tries to define political correctness, like the famous \u2018elephant test,\u2019 you know it when you see it. The outcome is pretty much the same though, a desire to make a disproportionate, unnecessary change to the majority in order to deal with an annoyance, whether real or imagined, to a minority.\n\nWe can safely say that this school\u2019s actions put political correctness over the needs of children. What a damning indictment of society when this has become the new normal!\n\nBy Jonathan Arnott, a former independent Member of the European Parliament\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
