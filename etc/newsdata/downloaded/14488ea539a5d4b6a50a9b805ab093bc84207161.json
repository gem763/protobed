Because he\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nBooker then suggested to McCain that words do matter.\n\n\u201cWe should watch the way we talk about each other,\u201d he said. \u201cSeriously, we can\u2019t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has no problem doing it to me,\u201d McCain said. \u201cHe was very nasty to me about this.\u201d\n\nThe senator suggested that McCain might want to try and be the bigger person.\n\n\u201cYou and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn\u2019t mean we show the same thing back to them,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running for president,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWith all due respect, and the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans, whether he or you like it or not, there is a lot of Republicans you have to win over.\u201d\n\nLast month, McCain said gun buybacks would lead to \u201ca lot of violence\u201d from gun owners.\n\n\u201cThis is a ground-level issue for me. If you\u2019re going to be a gun-grabber, you don\u2019t get my vote,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nIn response, O\u2019Rourke pointed out to The Daily Beast \u201cthat kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful.\u201d\n\nYou can see the complete segment below:\n\nIn an exchange with @MeghanMcCain, Cory Booker pushes back against McCain's criticism of Beto O'Rourke and explains his support for mandatory assault weapon buybacks: \"Other countries have done it.
