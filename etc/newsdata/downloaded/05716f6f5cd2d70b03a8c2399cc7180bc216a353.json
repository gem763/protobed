Body camera footage released by the police department shows Dean approaching the window with his gun drawn. He then fired one shot after shouting, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\"\n\nProfessional athletes such as Sacramento Kings forward Harrison Barnes and Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Malik Jackson offered to pay for Jefferson's funeral expenses after her death sparked outrage from critics who complained it was another case of excessive policing.\n\nThe footage appears to confirm that Dean did not identify himself as a police officer before he fired his weapon.\n\nDean resigned from the police department and was charged with murder. He was released on a $200,000 bond after he was arrested.\n\nIt is unclear if Dean has entered a plea for the charge.\n\nA service previously scheduled for Saturday was postponed by a judge at the request of Jefferson's father, who claimed in a Dallas County probate court that he had no control of the funeral or burial arrangements, which were planned by Jefferson's aunt.\n\nABC News' Karma Allen, Bill Hutchinson and William Mansell contributed to this report.", "description": "The funeral for Atatiana Jefferson, the Texas woman who was shot in her home by a Fort Worth Police officer, is underway after a judge halted the original service.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jefferson-winged-ap-mo-20191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
