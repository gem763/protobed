Windows 10X, also known by codename \u201cSantorini,\u201d is an ambitious effort from Microsoft to redesign Windows 10 for devices that don\u2019t even exist yet \u2014 like flexible tablets that morph into being capable of laptop-like tasks \u2014 devices like the Surface Neo.\n\nMicrosoft created the original Surface tablet and laptop hybrid more than seven years ago. In the intervening years, it changed from something that was weird and poorly executed into the flagship Windows device. Now, Microsoft is ready to try something bold and new again.\n\n\u201cWe see people using laptops. We see people using tablets. We saw an opportunity both at Microsoft and with our partners to fill in some of the gaps in those experiences and offer something new,\u201d explains Joe Belfiore, head of Windows experiences, in an interview with The Verge.\n\nThe Surface Neo is Microsoft\u2019s own vision of where Windows 10X will shine. It looks like a big, metal Moleskine journal when it\u2019s closed. But inside, there are two separate 9-inch displays that fold out to a full 13-inch workspace. The Surface Neo really feels like Microsoft\u2019s original Courier concept from 10 years ago is coming to life.\n\nLike most Surface devices, there\u2019s an intricate hinge that allows the Surface Neo to switch into a variety of modes and the typical high build quality you\u2019d expect from Microsoft\u2019s hardware. There\u2019s also a clever Bluetooth keyboard that flips, slides, and locks into place with magnets, which can be stowed and secured to the rear of the device. There\u2019s even a new Surface Slim Pen that attaches magnetically, and it\u2019s the same stylus Microsoft is using on the new Surface Pro X.\n\nYou could use it as a laptop, a book, or a tablet in ways we haven\u2019t exactly seen before. Microsoft isn\u2019t revealing much more about the Surface Neo hardware just yet, but Intel Lakefield processors will power the device. Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Asus are all also working on dual-screen or even foldable devices that will also run Windows 10X, so this isn\u2019t just a Microsoft and Surface effort.\n\nMicrosoft created Windows 10X in collaboration with its Surface hardware team, though. \u201cSo when we first got started on this project, obviously, we didn\u2019t have the hardware to start with,\u201d reveals Carmen Zlateff, engineering lead on Windows 10X, in an interview with The Verge. \u201cSo we do all of our prototyping on the Surface Go and Surface Pro... and as soon as the hardware is ready, we started to move that over. We were able to start long before the hardware was actually ready.\u201d\n\nThis is a key partnership. We saw a variety of OEMs experiment with wacky Windows devices back in the Windows 8 days and even some dual-screen hardware previously, but none of it has really had deep support within Windows itself. So the results have always been a Frankenstein\u2019s monster combination of software and hardware. This time, the software and hardware will be tightly integrated. For that reason, current Windows 10 devices will not be able to upgrade to Windows 10X, Microsoft says.\n\nAt first glance, the device looks like two Surface Go displays slapped together, and the gap between the displays on Microsoft\u2019s Surface Neo is clearly visible. This is intentional so that the displays can act independently and alongside each other. Central to how this all works is Microsoft\u2019s idea of \u201cpostures,\u201d which is the term the company uses for the various modes Windows 10X supports. There are more than you might expect.\n\n\u201dWe think these new dual-screen devices can help our customers bridge the gap between consumption and productivity,\u201d says Belfiore. \u201cThese devices go beyond a conventional laptop and tablet because they support some interesting new postures.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft envisions people using these devices in a variety of scenarios, some that are even identical to how people currently use a laptop. You can spin the device around, and apps and content will reflow intelligently. Microsoft\u2019s Office apps even make clever use of the second display by adding things like a slide list in PowerPoint.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to use Windows 10X devices in a number of ways:\n\nNote-taking: This mode lets you have one full-screen app on each display, where one could be a browser at the top showing some video content, and the other could be a note-taking app that a student is using in class. A pen can be used to take notes or even a separate hardware keyboard.\n\nThis mode lets you have one full-screen app on each display, where one could be a browser at the top showing some video content, and the other could be a note-taking app that a student is using in class.

Mobile presentation: This places content like a PowerPoint deck on the outside of the device, while you can read notes on the inside and control it with a keyboard.\n\nThis places content like a PowerPoint deck on the outside of the device, while you can read notes on the inside and control it with a keyboard. Portable all-in-one: This places the dual-screen device in a book mode where it can stand on a flat surface, and you use a detachable keyboard to work. It\u2019s similar to how you might use a dual-monitor setup at home.\n\nThis places the dual-screen device in a book mode where it can stand on a flat surface, and you use a detachable keyboard to work.

Laptop: You\u2019ll be able to use a software or hardware keyboard on one display, with the typical content on the primary display up top.\n\nWhile reading, presentation, and all-in-one modes are what you\u2019d expect from dual-screen devices, it\u2019s the laptop mode that I was most intrigued by. \u201cThese devices can have software keyboards as well as hardware keyboards,\u201d explains Zlateff. \u201cWe know that while people have learned well on mobile devices how to type on a screen, it\u2019s just still hard to do that on a PC form factor.\u201d\n\nOn Microsoft\u2019s own Surface Neo device, you can slide a hardware keyboard into place on top of one of the displays, and it can be used in clever ways. Unlike all of Microsoft\u2019s other Surface devices, this keyboard attachment doesn\u2019t have a trackpad. Instead, the display acts as a trackpad below or above the keyboard, depending on where you place it. Most modern trackpads are made out of glass, so Microsoft believes it\u2019ll feel natural to use.\n\nWhat\u2019s really different here compared to regular laptops is the ability to move the keyboard around freely. Depending on where you place it, Windows 10X might display a new rich input area above the keyboard area that Microsoft is calling WonderBar. It\u2019s similar in concept to Apple\u2019s Touch Bar, but it\u2019s less restrictive and \u2014 of course \u2014 bigger.\n\nIt\u2019s an area where you can pop in a picture-in-picture version of a YouTube video or access emoji and GIFs for when you\u2019re replying to messages and emails. Microsoft is considering allowing people to use inking in this section and working with app partners like Netflix and Spotify to optimize apps for this area. It feels like there\u2019s a lot more to come from the WonderBar.\n\nElsewhere, Windows 10X looks and feels a lot like Windows 10. \u201cOur intent here is that fans of Windows 10 will be able to use Windows 10X with no learning curve,\u201d explains Belfiore. \u201cWe want the navigation functionality to feel familiar. We want them to be able to get the apps they want to use. We want them to have no doubt that it\u2019s Windows 10.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t totally ditched its Windows roots here. \u201cWe did not wipe the slate clean. Instead, we\u2019re evolving the core of Windows 10,\u201d says Belfiore. \u201cWhat we\u2019re building is an evolution of where we\u2019ve been going with Windows 10, and it\u2019s OneCore tech.\u201d\n\nOneCore is a shared set of technologies that Microsoft has been working on to allow Windows to span across device types from desktop PCs to things like the Xbox One console and HoloLens headset. Windows 10X is now part of this same family of devices.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: what about apps? Windows 10X, like Windows Phone, could live by the apps and software that really take advantage of these dual displays, or it could die by the lack of apps available.\n\nMicrosoft is trying to tackle the problem in two ways. The first is simply encouraging Windows app developers to create apps that intentionally take advantage of the hinge. Microsoft calls this \u201capp enlightenment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to take the best of the applications that people need and use most \u2014 things like Mail, Calendar, and PowerPoint \u2014 and bring them over to dual screens in a way that creates flexible and rich experiences that are unique to this OS and devices,\u201d explains Zlateff. \u201cOur goal is that the vast majority of apps in the Windows Store will work with Windows 10X.\u201d\n\nThis also means you\u2019ll be able to load regular win32 traditional desktop apps on Windows 10X. Microsoft is using a container technology to allow legacy apps to run but not massively hit the battery. That\u2019s important because these new dual-screen devices have to power a whole extra screen compared to traditional laptops or tablets. That means Microsoft has to be smart with battery life. Microsoft isn\u2019t saying exactly how this container tech works, but it sounds like traditional apps will run in an isolated container rather than being fully virtualized, as there\u2019s no need to run a virtual machine when there\u2019s an Intel processor inside. Microsoft is promising more software information at Build in May 2020.\n\nOutside of traditional Windows apps, Windows 10X will rely on Progressive Web Apps (PWA), Universal Windows Apps (UWP), and apps that blend local and web code to take advantage of the dual displays. Microsoft really hasn\u2019t had much luck attracting developers on Windows 10 to build its Universal Windows Apps, and the company has expanded the definition of these modern apps so far that it now essentially means any Windows app. That flexibility might be key, though. Unlike failed initiatives like Windows RT or Windows 10 S, you\u2019ll be able to download any app and install it just like you would on a regular Windows 10 desktop PC. That should help bridge the gap of apps until ones appear that are really optimized to take advantage of dual displays.\n\nMicrosoft is also making some changes to the UI in this version of Windows. Live Tiles are gone from the Start Menu, replaced instead with a list of apps, documents, and files. It\u2019s a Start Menu that better reflects what you\u2019ve actually been doing on your device, instead of lots of tiles animating the weather or news.\n\n\u201cWe think this feels familiar to people who are using tablets and mobile devices today, and we\u2019ve tried to use the screen real estate in a way that combines app launching with suggestions of things like websites, documents, or things you\u2019re working on,\u201d explains Belfiore. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to really strike a great balance between familiarity and progress.\u201d\n\nOutside of apps, I think a lot of people will question the need for dual-screen devices initially. It\u2019s difficult, without trying one of these devices, to appreciate the need for something beyond the tablet and laptop. But Microsoft is convinced they\u2019ll be part of the future. \u201cThink of the mom sitting at the soccer practice being able to work on her proposal or completing some work on the bus on the way home,\u201d explains Zlateff. \u201cFor anyone who needs to have increased productivity throughout the different phases of their day, this device is for them.\u201d\n\nFor Microsoft, this is still all super early, especially on the software side. Although we were able to touch the Surface Neo, we weren\u2019t able to capture a full hands-on video as the software and hardware are still in development. Devices from OEMs and even Microsoft won\u2019t go on sale until fall 2020, and the next year will be spent refining the software and hardware. Right now, Microsoft and its partners are experimenting with hardware that is between 9 and 12 inches diagonally per display.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t imagine this going to very small devices,\u201d says Belfiore. Windows 10X isn\u2019t designed for smartphone-like devices that fold out into tablets. This is more for tablets transforming into laptops, a strength that Microsoft has focused on for its Surface line. But that\u2019s not to say the company isn\u2019t thinking about smaller dual-screen devices \u2014 a smartphone-sized Surface Duo running Android is also in the works.\n\nA lot of things could change before these devices end up in consumers\u2019 hands. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re talking about this now is getting unique hardware built and having it available to our ISVs (independent software vendors) and having the user experience, really, this is a thing the ecosystem will evolve toward doing,\u201d says Belfiore. \u201cWe do recognize it\u2019s early. There\u2019s lots that could change as we iterate and listen to people\u2019s feedback, but we wanted to get started and let the world know we\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has some serious competition, too. Google is adding native support for foldable devices into Android, and Samsung has even shipped its foldable Galaxy Fold device. LG has also created a dual-screen Android phone, and there\u2019s bound to be more experiments in the year ahead. Microsoft is focusing on its strengths of transforming a tablet into a laptop, while Android phone makers are attempting to convert phones into tablets. As the technology matures over the next decade, we could even see phones that bend into tablets and laptops.\n\nMicrosoft has now set the stage for its dual-screen and foldable ambitions, and it\u2019s now up to Surface and Microsoft\u2019s OEMs to deliver the promised software and hardware experience.\n\nAs futuristic as this Surface Neo hardware looks, the truth is that its success or failure will be decided by Windows 10X. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s an opportunity to do innovative work, to try to meet customers where they\u2019re at, and enable people to do things they haven\u2019t done before,\u201d explains Belfiore. \u201cIt\u2019s an area we\u2019re just excited about.\u201d", "description": "Microsoft has created its own dual-screen Surface Neo device.
