When you look at where Liverpool are at the moment and where United are, it's hard to see how United are going to get anything from this game.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I can't imagine any of the United players are going to be looking forward to it, while Liverpool will be raring to go.\"\n\nHe added: \"Hopefully Solskjaer will be given the time to rectify the situation at United, but managers just aren't given the time these days.\n\n\"He's probably got another four or five games left and if the club isn't looking in a better position, then a decision is going to have to be made.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"It's a really difficult situation, as he started off being hailed as a messiah of great hope, but it turned sour almost overnight.\n\n\"There's usually a decline over a certain period, but it almost happened immediately and now United are in a very tough place.", "description": "The Manchester United manager faces the tougher task of his season when the Red Devils host Liverpool", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19007243.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Manchester-United-v-Crystal-Palace.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
