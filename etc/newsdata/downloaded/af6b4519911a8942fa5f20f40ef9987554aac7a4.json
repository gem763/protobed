Franco then ruled Spain as an autocrat until his death.\n\nThe exhumation is \u201cintensely symbolic for Spain\u201d, said political scientist Pablo Simon, \u201cbecause the (Franco) monument has always been connected to those who miss the old regime\u201d.\n\nRelatives of late Spanish dictator Francisco Franco carry the coffin after the exhumation at The Valle de los Caidos (The Valley of the Fallen) in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, October 24, 2019. Mariscal/Pool via REUTERS\n\nMEDIA BLACKOUT\n\nSeeking to play down its repercussions, the government had enforced a media blackout and forbidden Franco\u2019s family from draping his coffin in the Spanish flag.\n\nBut in a gesture of solidarity with his ancestor, his eldest grandson and namesake Francisco Franco carried a Franco-era nationalist flag into the valley mausoleum, Reuters TV footage showed, for a ceremony that highlighted deep political and social divisions.\n\nA poll in newspaper El Mundo this month showed 43% of Spaniards favored the transfer of Franco\u2019s remains while 32.5% opposed it.\n\nIn a Reuters interview on Wednesday, Francisco Franco had accused the government of engineering the exhumation \u201cas propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes before an election\u201d.\n\nAlbert Rivera, whose center-right Ciudadanos party abstained in the parliamentary vote to ratify the coffin\u2019s transfer, said on Thursday that almost two-thirds of Spaniards had not lived or suffered under Franco.\n\nSlideshow (36 Images)\n\n\u201cThe bones of a dictator who died 44 years ago should not be a government\u2019s priority in my opinion. The only silver lining is that (acting Socialist Prime Minister) Pedro Sanchez will stop talking about Franco\u2019s bones,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the dictator\u2019s burial alongside his victims has long raised critical questions among historians and campaigners, including 93-year-old Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz.\n\n\u201cIt was time (to move him). It was overdue,\u201d said Sanchez-Albornoz, who as a prisoner of Franco\u2019s Fascist regime was forced to help build the Valley of the Fallen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited many decades for (him) to disappear from this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the dictators of Franco\u2019s ilk have vanished from Europe \u2014 Hitler, Mussolini \u2014 and were not honored with such tombs,\u201d he told Reuters.", "description": "Cries of \"long live Franco!\" accompanied the coffin of Francisco Franco on Thursday as Spain removed the remains of its former dictator from the state mausoleum where he was buried in 1975.", "authors": ["Clara-Laeila Laudette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444484989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N113", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
