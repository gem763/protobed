The new tax will be applied even to non-smokers if they visit a restaurant that serves shisha.\n\nSome restaurants have already stopped offering shisha, while others have lowered their prices.\n\nAlso on rt.com Saudi Arabia opens up to foreign tourism to reduce economic reliance on oil\n\nThe government's official gazette said this month that the tax will apply to all tobacco products. However, the ministry explained the ruling will apply \"to the total invoice of the business serving tobacco products.\"\n\nArabic hashtag \"tax on hookah restaurants\" is currently trending on social media networks, with customers posting photos of their restaurant bills. The bills demonstrate the initial amount more than doubles when taking into account the new 100 percent tax and a still-unpopular five percent value added tax which went into effect last year.\n\nThe new measure comes in addition to others, like cutting subsidies on fuel and power and imposing new taxes including on cigarettes and soft drinks.\n\nSome suggest the new tax could be a measure to protect public health.\n\n\"This is an indirect way to prohibit shisha without actually prohibiting it,\" one Twitter user said.\n\nAnother pointed out the decision goes against the country's Vision 2030 ambitions to change its ultra-conservative image and revamp the economy.\n\nAlso on rt.com Vaping damages DNA, may increase cancer & heart disease risk \u2013 study\n\nSaudi columnist Bassam Fatiny criticized the size of the tax as ill-considered.\n\n\"Let us assume that tax on tobacco has environmental and health benefits, is it logical that it be 100 percent!\" he said on Twitter. \"The ministry must have misunderstood Vision (2030).\"\n\nOpening the country to tourism and encouraging investment is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Vision 2030 reform program to wean the Saudi economy off oil.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s 100% hookah tax hike ignites social media fury", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5dadc42b2030272f7d0ae10e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
