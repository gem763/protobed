But if you\u2019re just going to smear people casually on podcasts, you are playing right into the Russians\u2019 hands\" https://t.co/ma82IikqS7 \u2014 Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) October 19, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s absolutely right. Who needs the Russians to do anything if people like Clinton are going to keep the paranoia and false accusations going without their help?\n\nThis is true. True for Hillary but also very true for an irresponsible media that for nearly 3 yrs carried water for Putin in pushing the Russian collusion fairytale. Putin didn\u2019t destabilize our democracy: the collusion mongers did because they chose to push it. https://t.co/OIbSPQS2sy \u2014 Ned Ryun (@nedryun) October 19, 2019\n\nWell said. Never mind the Mueller report \u2014 there are probably millions who honestly believe Russia somehow installed Donald Trump in the Oval Office \u2026 not through collusion, though, but through the purchase of a few Facebook memes.\n\nThis is an excellent, excellent comment\u2026 \u2014 TheThinker (@TheRewster) October 19, 2019\n\nShe had the evidence on her email server. \u2014 Bondage Dividend (@Disquietous) October 19, 2019\n\nGood one.\n\nApparently the new take on being a Russian asset is that the asset doesn\u2019t have to be paid by Russia, or in fact even know that Russia has made them an asset, to in fact be an asset. Truly. \u2014 NH (@NomadHominem) October 19, 2019\n\nVan Jones must have been away for the last 3 years. Doesn\u2019t he know what his beloved party has become these days? \u2014 Stan Shtramel (@sshtramel) October 19, 2019\n\nIt's hard for me to like and retweet this because Van is somehow still perpetuating the Russiagate narrative\u2026 But I will anyway because at least he's not giving Hillary her usual blank cheque. \u2014 Paxxwell (@Paxxwell) October 19, 2019\n\nSame \u2014 April Ngo (@aprilmay_n) October 19, 2019\n\n@VanJones68 is gonna get himself booted if he keeps spitting all these facts \u2014 Brandon Reyes \ud83e\udde2 (@breyescu18) October 19, 2019\n\nWhere in the hell was that kind of rational thinking for the last 3 years?! \u2014 C\u029c\u1d1c\u1d04\u1d0b F\u029f\u1d07\u1d1b\u1d04\u029c\u1d07\u0280 (Ciucc to the nooch) (@RealGuitarDood) October 19, 2019\n\nHe was on his way to saying something truly profound and then right at the end he remembered he really loves that CNN gig. \u2014 Childless GenX LaCroix Aunt Voter (@koalatwin) October 19, 2019\n\nResistance Queen is destroying Resistance. \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 Aisha Sharna (@SharnaAisha) October 19, 2019\n\nI remember when Mitt Romney was roundly criticized for claiming that Russia was our biggest threat. \u2014 Greggo (@GregGreggo) October 19, 2019\n\nWhen did real life become a reddit thread where we accuse people of being Russian bots right and left?
