(AP) - Evander Kane became the first San Jose player to score three goals in the opening period of a game and the Sharks beat the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 on Wednesday night for their third straight victory.\n\nKane opened the scoring at even strength and added two power-play goals in the first for his second career hat trick. The Sharks are hitting their stride after beginning the season with four straight losses.\n\nTomas Hertl had a goal and two assists and Barclay Goodrow also scored for San Jose. Martin Jones made 36 saves.\n\nDougie Hamilton and Erik Haula scored for the Hurricanes, who had won seven of their first eight games this season for the best start in franchise history. James Reimer stopped 17 shots.\n\nThe Hurricanes controlled play for much of the opening period, holding a 14-3 advantage in shots at one point despite having played the previous night in Los Angeles. But Jones came up with some key big saves early and Kane was the player who got most of the production.\n\nHe opened the scoring midway through the period when Erik Karlsson\u2019s point shot was blocked. Kane gathered the rebound and beat Reimer from the slot.\n\nAfter Hamilton tied the game with his fifth goal of the season, Kane scored twice on the power play in the final three minutes of the period. His second goal was similar to the first as Brent Burns\u2019 point shot was blocked and Kane converted the rebound from the slot.\n\nThen in the closing seconds of the period, Kane deflected a shot from Burns past Reimer to make it 3-1. The Sharks entered the game with only three power-play goals before converting both opportunities in the first period against Carolina.\n\nGoodrow scored his third of the season when he forced a turnover in the neutral zone and skated in to beat Reimer.\n\nThe Sharks nearly added another goal late in the second when Lucas Wallmark\u2019s back pass on a delayed penalty hit the Carolina post after Reimer had been pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nThe Hurricanes were unable to convert on the ensuing power play or during 45 seconds of a two-man advantage when Goodrow was sent to the box for hooking.\n\nNOTES: Kane\u2019s first hat trick came on March 17, 2018, when he scored four times at Calgary. \u2026 Sharks forward Marcus Sorensen returned after missing three games with an upper-body injury. \u2026 Carolina forward Sebastian Aho assisted on Hamilton\u2019s goal for the 200th point of his career. \u2026 San Jose forward Timo Meier played his 200th career game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHurricanes: Visit Anaheim on Friday night.\n\nSharks: Host Buffalo on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Evander Kane became the first San Jose player to score three goals in the opening period of a game and the Sharks beat the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 on Wednesday night for their third straight victory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/hurricanes_sharks_hockey_51707_c0-197-4732-2957_s1200x700.jpg?58623b696d465a74db681a4024b7a8124699ea58", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
