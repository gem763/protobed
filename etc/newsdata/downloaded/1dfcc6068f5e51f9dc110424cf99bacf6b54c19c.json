The SDF gave a lower figure of 45.\n\nSeparately, Kurdish media reports said Kurdish female politician Hevrin Khalaf had been killed, although it was unclear how she had died.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The key border town of Ras al-Ain has been hit by heavy Turkish bombardment\n\nTurkey's military said one of its soldiers had died and three others had been wounded.\n\nSome 49 fighters with the pro-Turkish rebels (known as the Syrian National Army) have also been killed.\n\nWhat about civilians?\n\nTwenty-eight civilians have died in Kurdish-held territory since Wednesday, many of them in the Tal Abyad area, according to SOHR.\n\nDozens have also been seriously injured. One hundred thousand people have already been forced from their homes, according to the UN, but aid groups warn the number could rise to 450,000.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria said more than 191,000 people had already been displaced.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Residents flee their homes in Ras al-Ain\n\nThe fighting has also forced Tal Abyad's only public hospital to close.\n\nTurkish sources say 17 civilians have been killed in Kurdish shelling on Turkey's side of the border since the operation began - among them a Syrian baby.\n\nWhat's the reaction to the operation?\n\nKurdish leaders, whose militia fought with the US to defeat IS, accuse the US of stabbing them in the back after Mr Trump effectively gave Turkey the go-ahead to move into north-eastern Syria.\n\nMr Trump now says he wants the US to negotiate a truce between Nato ally Turkey and the Kurds. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, says the military operation will continue.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption US forces are still present in parts of northern Syria, including Hassakeh province\n\nThe incursion has been condemned by many in the US and other Western countries and pressure is building in Washington to get Turkey to stop.\n\nGermany said on Saturday it was reducing its arms sales to Turkey over the operation.\n\nPresident Trump has suggested he would be prepared to use sanctions against Turkey if necessary.\n\nWhat about IS?\n\nThe SDF's Redur Xelil warned on Saturday that the Turkish operation was \"no longer threatening the revival\" of IS but \"rather it has revived it and activated its cells\".\n\nIt comes after five IS members escaped from prison in the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli amid Turkish shelling on Friday. The same day the group said it was behind a deadly car bombing there.\n\nOn Saturday IS declared a new campaign in Syria, which it said was to avenge its members' detention in Kurdish-run prisons.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"There are different degrees of radicalisation among the women\"\n\nThe SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border.\n\nTwo camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the \"safe zone\".\n\nOn Friday the Kurdish-led authorities said discussions were under way on how to move the Ain Issa camp, which had been hit by shelling.\n\nTurkey says it will take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive.\n\nAre you in the affected area?
