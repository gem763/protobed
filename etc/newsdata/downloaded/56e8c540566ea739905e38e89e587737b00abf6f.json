The eighth coal producer to collapse into bankruptcy over the past year, Murray Energy is the latest to fall victim to diminished demand for coal and competition from cheaper fuels.\n\nThe Journal cited a series of contributing factors, including \u201cabundant natural gas and renewable energy sources.\u201d The article also quoted Murray Energy\u2019s current CEO pointing to the \u201crecent trade war\u201d as a factor in depressing international demand for U.S. coal.\n\nNBC News ran a related report a couple of months ago, noting that Donald Trump promised miners \u201che would restore the industry \u2013 and their jobs \u2013 after years of steady decline.\u201d To that end, the Republican administration has \u201cloosened rules governing coal ash disposal and mercury pollution from power plants.\u201d Team Trump has also pushed dubious schemes to prop up coal plants.\n\nThe president and GOP senators even put a former coal industry lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t worked. Reuters reported earlier this year, \u201cMore U.S. coal-fired power plants were shut in President Donald Trump\u2019s first two years than were retired in the whole of Barack Obama\u2019s first term, despite the Republican\u2019s efforts to prop up the industry to keep a campaign promise to coal-mining states.\u201d\n\nConsider this chart I put together, showing the trajectory of coal mining jobs in the United States over the last decade. The blue line marks the trend during the Obama era, while the red line shows the Trump era.\n\nAs far as Trump was concerned, he could end Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d and push the industry to new heights, regardless of the environmental consequences. What the Republican didn\u2019t realize is that Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d wasn\u2019t real. The marketplace changed in ways politicians had little control over.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to blame Trump specifically for the industry\u2019s ongoing difficulties. This isn\u2019t the president\u2019s fault.\n\nIt would be entirely fair, however, to blame Trump for making promises he couldn\u2019t keep, assuring these workers and their families he could fix a problem he had no ability to fix, and failing spectacularly to help transition these communities to a new economic model.", "description": "It's not fair to blame Trump for the coal industry's severe troubles.
