Most of CT probably can't use it yet, but 1.4 billion people can. We will expand the service to other regions soon.\u201d\n\nSkirting the Great Wall\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Binance also plans to launch an over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform in October \u2014 likewise initially CNY-exclusive.\n\nThe exchange already runs an OTC trading desk for large-scale investors which raked in solid profits earlier this year.\n\nBoth OTC trades and P2P functionality have a particular significance in China, which takes a notoriously tough stance towards the trading and issuance of decentralized cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe country is meanwhile pursuing the development of a central government-backed digital currency, which is reportedly due for imminent launch by the People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nIn January 2018, Beijing banned fringe platforms, including P2P and OTC resources, tightening a blanket embargo on crypto-to-fiat trading and ICOs that was in place since September 2017.\n\nIn September, Binance made its first strategic Chinese investment since leaving the country in the wake of the Sept. 2017 crackdown. It reportedly participated in a $200 million funding round of Beijing-based Mars Finance, a China-based crypto and blockchain publication.", "description": "Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance launches peer-to-peer trading for Bitcoin, Ether and Tether against the Chinese Yuan", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZGM4YzU5ZDMzMjUyYTE4ZTFkMjBhYjQ0OGNkNTlmY2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
