The Wall Street Journal first reported the decision.\n\nRepublican senators and conservative anti-tax groups have pushed Mr. Trump over the past year to order the Treasury Department to change the definition of \u201ccost\u201d for calculating capital gains. Such a move would allow taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset for inflation when it sells, effectively reducing the profit earned on the sale and, with it, the tax liability.\n\nAnalyses by outside groups, including the Penn Wharton Budget Model, have found that the vast majority of the gains from the move would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, who disproportionately pay capital gains taxes. Advocates of the tax cut had argued that millions of middle-class Americans would also benefit, by reducing taxes on the sale of stocks held in their portfolios or pension funds.", "description": "More than a year of administration deliberations ended with a presidential decision not to index capital gains for inflation.", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/us/politics/11dc-Trrumptax/merlin_150683208_9c41ddae-6e59-471f-ba7f-5575fc55bd68-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
