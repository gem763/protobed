With bans on so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d and magazines, a \u201cmay-issue\u201d system for concealed carry licenses that leaves the average citizen unable to carry a firearm for self-defense, gun rationing laws, and more, the state is pretty hostile when it comes to the right to keep and bear arms. One couple in southern Maryland is hoping to change the culture, as well as helping to educate folks on how to be safe and responsible with a gun by opening up a new indoor range on their small farm.\n\nThe owners understand that their business is in the heart of a community that was once broken by a high school shooting. But Steve and Cindi Thomas believe that their public indoor range is a needed, secure environment for the community to practice and learn about firearms. \u201cWe have not had that [indoor] option for \u2014 it\u2019s been at least 20 years that we have the ability to shoot anywhere indoors around here,\u201d said Southern Maryland resident Bill Kitchens.\n\nI\u2019m excited for the folks in St. Mary\u2019s County, Maryland and I don\u2019t even live there. Much like the Thomas family, I live in a rural area where most gun owners have access to private property where they can shoot, which is great. However, some gun owners aren\u2019t going to know anyone with enough property where they can go plink, and for the gun owners who live around Farmville, Virginia, the closest indoor range is about an hour away in either Lynchburg or Richmond. That was also the case for residents of St. Mary\u2019s County before Flat Broke Shooters opened in August of this year. Since then, the Thomas\u2019s say the support from the community has been strong.\n\nSteve and Cindi Thomas say that they expected 20 percent of their business would come from families. But at nearly seven weeks in, they approximated families make up about 70 percent of their income. \u201cIf there\u2019s questions about firearms, if you\u2019re hesitant about firearms, we want a place where you can come \u2014 where maybe you\u2019re on the fence,\u201d Cindi Thomas said. \u201cThis is meant to be a family-type environment where you can come in, try it out, see if you like it.\u201d\n\nThe reporter from WJZ-TV in Baltimore notes that the range is about eight miles from Great Mills High School, where a student who stole his father\u2019s handgun shot two students in 2018, killing one before turning the gun on himself. It\u2019s pretty evident that the reporter was hoping to find some locals in the area who would criticize the new range as being \u201cinsensitive to the community\u201d or something like that, but they struck out.\n\nGreat Mills High School principal Jake Heibel said that he has not received any negative feedback on Flat Broke Shooters Range and its proximity to the school. \u201cNo students or parents have had complaints brought to me,\u201d Heibel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too far away.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d like to think that distance doesn\u2019t have as much to do with it as common sense, but whatever the reason, the new range seems to be enjoying popularity in the community. Congratulations to Steve and Cindi Thomas, and if you ever find yourself in southern Maryland on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, stop by Flat Broke Shooters for a little range time and to show your support for a couple trying to ensure that, despite the best efforts of anti-gun politicians in the state, those who want to exercise their right to keep and bear arms can do so safety and responsibly.", "description": "Maryland is known more for gun control than gun ownership, but a couple in St. Mary's County is bucking the trend with a new indoor range.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/54e5d7444256b114a6da837ec32f2a7f1038deec5b51784f72_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
