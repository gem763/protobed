In that I\u2019m a full-time professional comedian who makes a living doing comedy around the topic of drugs, and I've got a BBC Sounds podcast, Jacob Hawley: On Drugs, that explores the UK drugs scene.\n\nThe last few months of my life have largely been dedicated to this project - to investigating drug culture in the UK and the effects it has; from politics to policing to our health service to nightclubs. As a recreational user of drugs for the best part of a decade, I\u2019ve been staggered by how much I've learned in a matter of weeks.\n\nI\u2019ve been delighted to meet so many people along the way, and to share my journey with listeners of the podcast in a way that hopefully entertains, informs, and enlightens.\n\nAnd probably means I won\u2019t ever be able to get a normal day job ever again.", "description": "Here are the five most surprising things I have learned about the UK drug scene", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07lsx7m.jpg"}
