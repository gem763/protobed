I\u2019m from Australia, where the Japanese dining landscape is mostly dried seabeds of sushi and tempura bound by rivers of teriyaki sauce. The truly alien encounters await in Japan\u2019s gastronomic world, from surreal sea creatures to pod-like akebi fruit.\n\nThere are 400 Japanese words just to describe food texture. Many are a charming onomatopoeia, like fuwa fuwa (fluffy) or mochi mochi (chewy). This, then, is my onomatopoeic eating journey.\n\nWarning: These foods might confound your taste buds and mess with your psyche.\n\nWith that obligatory message out of the way, like a lightweight Anthony Bourdain, I\u2019ll start with the mildly disconcerting and finish with the fully terrifying.\n\n1. Beta beta yokan\n\nYokan.\n\nI love pastries and buns. Too bad in Japan they\u2019re often pumped with anko (also called an) most commonly, an azuki (red bean) and sugar paste. From manju (steamed bread) to mochi (rice flour cakes), Japan abounds in anko stealth bombs disguised as dessert.\n\nYokan are bouncy anko and kanten (algae jelly) blocks. It\u2019s the specialty of Toraya, a wagashi (traditional sweets) empire founded in Kyoto circa the early 1500s and a purveyor to the Imperial Palace. You can buy yokan at Toraya department store outlets or caf\u00e9s across Japan.\n\nJapan abounds in anko stealth bombs disguised as dessert.\n\nYokan is rich, dense and (as the Japanese call it) beta beta (cloyingly sticky). As with peanut butter, anko fans like to debate the merits of smooth versus chunky, but for this Westerner, legumes as candy are weird because I think of chili con carne. It\u2019s not unpleasant but won\u2019t replace Pocky as my go-to snack.\n\n2. Tsuru tsuru tororo\n\nPhoto: Audrey Foo Tororo, grated mountain yam, with rice.\n\nVegetarians do not get off lightly in Japan, where textures like neba neba (gluey, like the natto mentioned at the start) are revered. Tororo is a bland slurry of grated raw yamaimo (mountain yam), often served on rice or noodles with soy sauce and green onions and making tsuru tsuru (slurping noises) while eating it is encouraged.\n\nIn olden times, tororo was praised as an aphrodisiac, dubbed \u201cmedicine of the mountains\u201d and described\u2014when topped with a raw egg\u2014as the sky \u201cwith a full moon.\u201d Gee, the Japanese can wax poetic because, to be honest, it was like diving in phlegm. My friend and I were defeated one-third in by this viscous sludge.\n\nGee, the Japanese can wax poetic because, to be honest, it was like diving in phlegm.\n\nYamaimo is sold grated and frozen in supermarkets or prepared in specialized restaurants. The ultimate pilgrimage is the shop Chojiya, in Mariko-juku in Shizuoka Prefecture\u2014an atmospheric thatched roof eatery established in 1586.\n\n3. Saku saku inago\n\nInago no tsukudani are locusts boiled in soy sauce and salt or sugar.\n\nLeggy, beady-eyed insects are visually startling but I tried some saku saku (delicate, crispy) treats in Tsumago-juku in Nagano Prefecture that were inago (grasshoppers) fried in soy sauce and sugar\u2014and they went down surprisingly well. Close your eyes and you could be crunching senbei (rice crackers). I could munch these watching Netflix.\n\nHistorically, inago and other critters like wasp larvae and silkworm pupae were consumed in rural inland prefectures, such as Nagano and Gifu, that lack coastal access to seafood. Ryokan (traditional inns), souvenir shops and supermarkets here still promote insects as regional delicacies. Or get your bug fix in the preserved Edo-period town Ouchi-juku in Fukushima.\n\nI could munch these watching Netflix.\n\nInsects were catapulted from their country roots at Tokyo\u2019s Michelin-starred Den, which served ants that popped in the mouth, releasing lemony flavors. Cheap, plentiful, nutrient-packed, space-efficient, fast-growing insects could be the food of the future. Bee larvae supposedly taste like nutty marshmallows. Why not couverture chocolate-dipped grubs?\n\n4. Puri puri motsu\n\nPhoto: Audrey Foo Beef motsunabe in a Tokyo hot pot under Yurakucho train station.\n\nOffal consumption spiked during Japan\u2019s post-WWII food shortages. Today, the spirit of mottainai (avoiding waste) is still heartily embraced with the widespread popularity of motsu, horumon or naizo (all of which are various forms of pork or beef innards). Yakitori (grilled chicken) chefs can chop a bird into 40 edible parts, from rubbery uterus to tender combs.\n\nCharcoal cooking and syrupy basting sauce turn meat scraps into tasty morsels. I couldn\u2019t swallow the puri puri (springy, bouncy) mysteries in a beef motsunabe (offal hot pot) but the broth was heavenly, bursting with \u201cgutsy\u201d complexity. Unfortunately, I\u2019m still haunted by the tough horse intestine I was served in the Kiso Valley.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m still haunted by the tough horse intestine I was served in the Kiso Valley.\n\nMotsu is casual, home-style fare, so follow the red lanterns or railway tracks to casual izakaya (pubs) and open stalls in alleys or around train stations. Head to Osaka, believed to be Japan\u2019s birthplace of offal barbecue. Fukushige Horumon has English menus. Hakata is renowned for motsunabe and Hiroshima is home ground for horumon tempura.\n\n5. Nuru nuru shirako\n\nPhoto: Audrey Foo Shirako at the Nishiki Market in Kyoto.\n\nIn this nation of islands, the ocean delivers both treasures and terror. Shiokara is chopped seafood, usually squid, smothered in its fermented guts. Odori-don (\u201cdancing\u201d squid or octopus) features still-twitching flesh from the freshly killed animal. However, the greatest psychological challenge is milt or shirako (fish sperm sacs, usually from cod).\n\nResembling monster tentacles from a horror film, nuru nuru (slimy, slippery) shirako is sometimes labeled \u201csoft roe,\u201d but translates to \u201cwhite children.\u201d No, not creepy at all. It\u2019s tasteless, creamy and custardy; evoking soft tofu. The accompanying soy citrus sauce couldn\u2019t wash away the filmy residue left behind. You might need a good, stiff drink.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen, you can source shirako in izakaya, sushi bars or market seafood stalls, especially in winter. Still traumatized from the tororo, my friend refused to join in.\n\n\u201cCome on. Just try a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not marketing it to you right. What if I said it\u2019s seminal fluid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t eat shirako to be \u201cJapanese.\u201d Only one out of the seven locals I asked said they like it. Don\u2019t do it for kudos. People respond with silence when I share my shirako tale, not fist bumps or high fives.\n\nI downed these kooky foods to research this story and I thought I was done with them, but lately, I\u2019ve started craving grilled motsu! Through travel, we devour new experiences and change in unexpected ways. Mistakes are inevitable. I\u2019ve hovered\u2014 intimidated\u2014outside enchanting eight-seat diners with Japanese-only menus baffling to me as hieroglyphics. Perhaps it\u2019s time to step through the noren (shop curtains).\n\nI\u2019ve eaten fish sperm\u2014what\u2019s the worst that can happen now?", "description": "", "authors": ["Audrey Foo", "James Darnbrook", "Randiah Camille Green", "Erika Van 'T Veld"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2018/08/5-Scary-Japanese-Foods-Shirako.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
