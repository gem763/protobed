More\n\nDETROIT, Ore. \u2013 Robb Campbell wasn\u2019t sure his 911 call worked.\n\nLost in a fierce snowstorm and wandering 7 miles from where he was supposed to be hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon, he made a desperate call for help.\n\nBut the call dropped part-way through, and he was knee-deep in fresh snow with no idea whether anyone was coming.\n\nWithout food, his gear soaked and fighting blizzard-like conditions, the veteran backpacker knew that if he didn\u2019t find someone, he wasn\u2019t going to last long.\n\n\u201cYou just know, if anything happens, I\u2019m dead,\u201d Campbell told the Statesman Journal Saturday. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to find me until Spring.\u201d\n\nLost since Thursday, his best break came Friday when he found temporary shelter inside a pit toilet at Breitenbush Lake.\n\nNot long after that, Marion County Sheriff's Search and Rescue deputies Mark Knospe and Mark Ferran found Campbell at about 2:30 p.m. after spotting and tracking his fresh foot prints.\n\nThe All-Seasons Motel in Detroit gave the 50-year-old from the East Coast a complimentary room Friday night and he will pay to stay there the next two nights while he recovers from his ordeal, including frostbite to his feet.\n\n\u201cYou count your blessings,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cYou thank your lucky stars. Not to be overly dramatic, because people have been through much worse, I\u2019m sure. But I wouldn\u2019t have survived another night. I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d\n\nAfter being lost in blizzard conditions in the Willamette National Forest and eventually found by a Search and Rescue team, Robb Campbell recovers from minor frost bite at the All Seasons Motel in Detroit, Oregon, on October 19, 2019. Campbell has been hiking the Pacific Crest Trail since May, and intends to finish the trail. More\n\nA later-life hiker\n\nCampbell was born outside Philadelphia, went to school in Georgia and worked in Atlanta as a teacher and for a hedge fund for about 30 years.\n\nHe said he was fired from a job three years ago, and in 2018 put all of his possessions into storage and hiked the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine over a 10 month period.\n\nWhat he found on that trek was greater than he expected.\n\nPeople he met \u201cwould have given me the shirt off their back, and that\u2019s the community,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful job search, he decided in May to hike the entire Pacific Crest Trail, starting at the Mexico border and heading north.\n\nHe was in Ridgecrest, California, when a 6.4 earthquake hit, and he experienced the best of people as he received generosity from strangers while thousands of miles from home.\n\nThe trail, which is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, was designated a National Trail in 1968, but not officially completed until 1993. It runs from Mexico to Canada over 2,650 miles, including the length of Oregon.\n\nPerhaps the most notable person to hike the trail was Cheryl Strayed, who wrote a book, \"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,\" about her experience. Later it was turned into the Reese Witherspoon movie \"Wild.\"\n\nRobb Campbell reaches mile 2,000 on his journey hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.
