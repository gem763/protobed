Of the 19, 17 aren\u2019t retiring from Congress to pursue some kind of political promotion. Meanwhile, only four Democrats in all are retiring from Congress. To analyze these numbers in the context of what happened in the midterms is to conclude that Republicans are limping toward a disastrous Election Day.\n\nMaybe Trump\u2019s fortunes are untethered from his party\u2019s. Maybe, as has happened so often over the course of his charmed life, he will soar while all around him plummet, and they instead of he will suffer for his sins. His campaign associates go to jail; he goes to the Group of 7. The most principled Republicans are driven from the fold; he reigns without principle over a party that has largely bent to his wishes rather than stand up for what it purported to believe.\n\n\u201cMost often I\u2019m asked why so many Republicans aren\u2019t running for re-election,\u201d Dave Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told me. \u201cBut I ask why so many are. This isn\u2019t the cruise they signed up for.\u201d He noted that up until a few months before Trump effectively secured the Republican nomination in 2016, not a single Republican in Congress had endorsed him. The first two House members who took that icy plunge \u2014 Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California \u2014 are now under criminal indictment (though not for anything having to do with Trump).\n\nBoth before the midterms and now, Republicans are leaving Congress for all sorts of reasons. But they outnumber Democrats on the way out because, generally speaking, they assume that Republicans will remain in the House minority and they\u2019re exhausted by the tandem experiences of powerlessness and answering for Trump\u2019s chaos and cruelties.\n\nThe departures this time around speak volumes about looming threats to the Republican Party. Five of the House Republicans who aren\u2019t running again, including Hurd, are from Texas, a red state whose demographic composition fills Democrats with more and more hope. Two of only 13 Republican women in the House are stepping down. Hurd is the only black Republican in the House \u2014 a detail that he underlined in a sort of farewell note that he wrote and posted on his website.\n\nThat note, read carefully, is a warning to fellow Republicans and a kind of subtweet of Trump\u2019s spectacularly divisive governing style. \u201cI will stay involved in politics to grow a Republican Party that looks like America,\u201d Hurd wrote, adding that he loves America because \u201cwe are neither Republican nor Democrat nor independent. We are better than the sum of our parts.\u201d\n\nHurd announced his decision not to run again shortly after Trump attacked \u201cthe squad\u201d of four congresswomen of color by tweeting that they should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. He was one of only four House Republicans who voted to condemn those remarks, which he told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour were \u201cracist and xenophobic.\u201d", "description": "What do retiring members of Congress know that President Trump doesn\u2019t?", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/opinion/sunday/08bruni/08bruni-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
