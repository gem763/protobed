The newly discovered pulsar, J0740+6620, stretches the limits of how massive and compact scientists believe these stars to be, according to a paper published today in Nature Astronomy.\n\nNeutron stars are remnants of collapsed star cores that have undergone a supernova explosion. Pulsars are an extremely dense type of neutron star that spin at regular intervals, sending blinking beams of light out from their magnetic poles and into the universe. Because pulsars blink with exceptional regularity, astronomers track these twinkling celestial oddities to gain insight into spacetime and general relativity.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n2.17\u2014The newly discovered neutron star weighs about 2.17 times the mass of the sun. (That\u2019s 333,000 times the mass of Earth!)\n\n15\u2014The diameter of J0740+6620 is approximately 15 miles.\n\n2,000\u2014In the more than 50 years since pulsars were discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967, scientists have measured over 2,000 of them.\n\n4,600\u2014Scientists say they detected signs of the neutron star roughly 4,600 light years away from Earth.\n\n100 million\u2014That\u2019s how much a sugar cube\u2019s worth of neutron star material would weigh here on Earth.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It's 15 miles across with a mass of more than twice the sun.", "authors": ["Jennifer Leman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9.ZLkVe.bEMHlpfUilxekg--~B/aD03MjQ7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/868ee4bb548342ca196e2d7077254630", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
