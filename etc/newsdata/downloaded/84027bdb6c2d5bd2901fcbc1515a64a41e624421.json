But the kick sailed wide left.\n\nBefore the Bulldogs got the ball, Georgia coach Kirby Smart made an extremely bad decision to call a timeout with South Carolina scrambling ahead of a 4th and 1 on its possession in the second overtime. The Gamecocks were all discombobulated ahead of the play and scrambled to the line with six seconds on the play clock. As a delay of game seemed inevitable, Smart called a timeout and saved South Carolina from the potential penalty.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSouth Carolina converted the fourth down on the next play after the timeout and Parker White kicked a field goal on the possession for what became the game-winning points.\n\nThe Gamecocks played much of the second half and all of overtime with backup Dakereon Joyner in at quarterback for the injured Ryan Hilinski.\n\nHilinski suffered a left knee injury when he got hit by a Georgia defender early in the third quarter. Hilinski had been filling in at QB for Jake Bentley, South Carolina\u2019s original starter, who suffered a foot injury in the first game of the season.\n\nJoyner, a converted wide receiver, kept South Carolina\u2019s offense moving with his ability to escape the pocket and improvise on scrambles. South Carolina\u2019s offense had fewer than 300 yards but didn\u2019t turn the ball over once.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s first OT escape\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bulldogs looked toast in the first overtime. Georgia got the ball to start the extra period and Jake Fromm appeared to have an easy second-down completion to Tyler Simmons. But the ball bounced off Simmons\u2019 hands and was intercepted by Israel Mukuamu.\n\nSouth Carolina needed just a field goal for the win. And the game-winning attempt came from a reasonable 34-yard distance. But White\u2019s kick sailed just over and outside the right upright.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s regulation escape\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp almost lost his team the game in regulation. The Gamecocks faced 4th and 4 at the Georgia 40 with 40 seconds left. And Muschamp decided to let White try a 58-yard field goal.\n\nWhite\u2019s career-long field goal came earlier in the game. It was from 49 yards out. Predictably, White\u2019s kick never came close to going through the uprights.\n\nThe decision gave Georgia the ball with two timeouts and an all-SEC kicker in Blankenship. While South Carolina blocked a Blankenship kick at the end of the second half \u2014 his first miss all season \u2014 it sure looked like Blankenship could be winning the game for the Bulldogs.\n\nBut then Georgia\u2019s offense stepped all over itself. Again. The Bulldogs got called for an illegal shift penalty on a play that started with eight seconds left. The five-yard penalty moved the ball back to the South Carolina 43. A makeable 55-yard field goal had been turned into a potential 60-yard kick.\n\nSmart then eschewed the idea of a long field goal. He kept the offense on the field. That play clearly didn\u2019t work because the game ended up in overtime.\n\nSouth Carolina beat Georgia 20-17 in double overtime on the road.

The Bulldogs got the ball back from South Carolina at their own 4 and moved the ball 96 yards in 13 plays for a game-tying touchdown with under two minutes left.\n\nThat touchdown came with an assist from a South Carolina penalty. A play before Demetris Robertson\u2019s spectacular TD catch, South Carolina was flagged for holding on a fourth-down play where Fromm threw a pass that had no hope of getting caught by a receiver.\n\nBut the Bulldogs were ultimately undone by a host of turnovers. Fromm threw three interceptions as Georgia\u2019s passing offense just could not get on track.\n\nFromm finished the game with 295 yards passing but threw 51 passes to get to that mark. The downfield shots were few and far between in Georgia\u2019s playbook and that allowed South Carolina to key in on the run. Georgia ran the ball 43 times for 173 yards \u2014 far worse than its normally efficient production on the ground.\n\nGeorgia can still make the playoff\n\nWhile there\u2019s not much to be happy about if you\u2019re a Georgia fan, you can\u2019t lose all hope either. There\u2019s still a very good path to the playoff for the Bulldogs.\n\nFirst, Georgia still controls its own destiny in the SEC East. If the Bulldogs win out, they\u2019re in the SEC Championship Game. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nSecond, there are three ranked opponents still left on the schedule including Florida and Auburn. Wins will move Georgia back up toward the top five. And a win in the SEC title game over whoever comes out of the SEC West will do a lot of good in the eyes of the College Football Playoff committee.\n\nAre the Bulldogs good enough to do that? We\u2019ll find out in the coming weeks whether or not Saturday was simply an aberration.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Georgia missed a field goal that would have sent the game to a third OT.", "authors": ["Nick Bromberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ob6IK9v3y2tQMH43Scisbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MD47oQhIG4IeTTVLg_fBsw--~B/aD0yMjUwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/42164ab0-ed29-11e9-abbe-6d85b0f404d9", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
