The new facility would provide family planning as well as a wide array of women\u2019s health-care services, including annual exams, breast cancer screenings and STD tests. It will offer both medical and surgical abortions.\n\nAD\n\nMissouri has some of the most severe abortion restrictions in the country, while neighboring Illinois has expanded access to its residents. Planned Parenthood operates the only remaining abortion provider in Missouri, located in St. Louis. That clinic will remain open, according to the organization.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe new health center is a testament to the needs of the greater bi-state region and our commitment to provide, protect and expand access to health care, no matter what,\u201d Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, McNicholas explained that Planned Parenthood was \u201creally intentional and thoughtful about making sure that we were able to complete this project as expeditiously as possible because we saw the writing on the wall \u2014 patients need better access, so we wanted to get it open as quickly as we could.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor some the 13-mile drive from our St. Louis clinic to this Illinois clinic is an opportunity for them to get that care with less judgment, less restriction, and far fewer hoops to jump through,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nPlanned Parenthood spent a portion of the summer locked in a legal battle to keep its St. Louis clinic open. In June, the state\u2019s health department attempted to deny a permit renewal application that allowed the clinic to perform abortions, but Planned Parenthood took its appeal to a state appeals panel and eventually won a stay.\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post, Mary Kate Knorr, the executive director of anti-abortion group Illinois Right to Life, contended Planned Parenthoods\u2019 goal with the facility was to make money.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMake no mistake \u2013 this new mega-facility is not a response to an increased demand, nor is it a gesture of care for women,\u201d Knorr said.\n\n\u201cThe construction of this new facility was a strategic business move \u2013 certainly not a defense of women,\" her statement continued.\n\nIn recent years, Missouri has passed several laws that restrict access to abortion. Women who wish to have an abortion must go through a 72-hour waiting period, and must receive \u201cinformed consent\u201d materials detailing the medical risks of abortion and describing the fetus at its current stage of development.\n\nAD\n\nThis year, Missouri also attempted to pass a law that would ban abortion after eight weeks, among other measures. In August, a federal judge temporarily blocked the eight-week ban from going into effect on the grounds that it conflicted with prior Supreme Court rulings, and that it posed a \u201cthreat of irreparable harm\u201d to patients. However, the bill contained other restrictions that did go into effect, including a prohibition against abortions conducted because of the fetus\u2019s race, sex or a prenatal test that indicates Down syndrome. The law mandates that a woman considering an abortion must be given materials that say: \u201cThe life of each human being begins at conception. Abortion will terminate the life of a separate, unique, living human being.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEmboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court and the potential to overturn the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade, several states have passed abortion bans that conflict with existing precedent on abortion law. In Tennessee, lawmakers are attempting to pass a bill that bans a woman from getting an abortion as soon as she knows she\u2019s pregnant. Earlier this year, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor signed a bill that would ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat was detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 but a federal judge blocked it from taking effect Tuesday.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis abortion bill is probably unconstitutional. A Republican lawmaker says that\u2019s the point.\n\nAntiabortion \u2018heartbeat\u2019 bills are illegal. Why do Republicans keep passing them?\n\nA sponsor of an Ohio abortion bill thinks you can reimplant ectopic pregnancies. You can\u2019t.\n\nAD", "description": "Women from a state where abortion is restricted had been crossing into Illinois to get health-care at a facility in that state.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ggbnmUO368KxhCdkSo8MImzfsXs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/REDQF2EETQI6TNMF4NVRNJJRVI.jpg"}
