But since raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour nearly a year ago, the restaurant industry in New York City has thrived.\n\nI\u2019m a professor with a focus on labor and employment law. My research on the minimum wage suggests a few reasons why this might be true.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t happened\n\nWhen worker pay goes up, employers can respond in a number of different ways. They can cut hours, lay off workers, accept smaller profits or raise prices.\n\nWith profits so low in the restaurant industry, averaging just 3%-5%, employers may not have the option to accept less in profits without going in the red.\n\nIn many industries, increased labor costs may prompt businesses to lay off American workers and move operations overseas where labor costs are lower. But this isn\u2019t a viable solution in the restaurant industry, since most of the work is done on-site.\n\nThat leaves restaurant owners with two options. The first is to decrease the number of hours each employee works, which might explain why income gains from a higher minimum wage aren\u2019t as large as one would predict.\n\nStill, massive layoffs in the restaurant industry are unlikely because owners need a certain number of staff to operate a full-service kitchen.\n\nThe other option is to increase prices, which many restaurants in New York City have done.\n\nPrices go up\n\nSome in the restaurant industry have argued that raising menu prices will lead to fewer people dining out and, consequentially, more restaurant closures.\n\nBut this hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nIn fact, both restaurant revenue and employment are up. The reason for this is that restaurants don\u2019t have to raise prices very much to pay for a minimum-wage increase.\n\nIn one study, for example, a $0.80 minimum wage increase equated to a 3.2% increase of food prices in restaurants in New Jersey. This is the amount that the New Jersey minimum wage increased in 1992.\n\nEven a one-time increase of 10% to 15% is unlikely to dissuade large numbers of customers from dining out. That would amount to an extra $1.20 on a $12 burger.\n\nThe focus on single restaurants also ignores the larger economic impact of raising the minimum wage. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, if low-wage workers have more money in their pockets, they will have more money to spend, potentially expanding the number of consumers who can afford to eat out.\n\nIn fact, some people \u2014 including those from the Economic Policy Institute \u2014 have posited that a minimum-wage increase will actually lead to an increase in employment because of the effects of giving low-wage workers a raise. Other advantages to restaurants may include lower turnover rates and better job performance.\n\nWage hikes help everyone\n\nPerhaps the principal reason that the minimum wage increase did not seem to have a negative effect on the restaurant industry in New York is that the state\u2019s economy is strong overall, so businesses have been able to absorb the increases without having to make hard decisions about where to cut.\n\nIf the economy were to go into a recession, business would undoubtedly suffer, though the suffering could hardly be attributed solely or mainly to a minimum-wage increase. In other words, a good economy means that everyone benefits, including low-wage workers.\n\nApocalyptic predictions of the industry\u2019s demise will likely return as New York officials debate whether to get rid of the tip credit, which allows employers to make up part of their minimum wage obligations in tips. Right now, restaurants actually have to pay workers only $10 per hour if they make at least $5 per hour in tips.\n\nThere are many good policy reasons to abolish the tip credit, including ensuring that workers have pay stability and combating the problem of sexual harassment in the service industry. Women working in restaurants with lower minimum wages than other industries in the state were twice as likely to report being sexually harassed by a customer than women who were paid their state\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nSeven states, including Alaska, Montana and Washington, have already abolished the tip credit. New York may be next.\n\nAs the debate unfolds, just remember to look at the data. A pay increase for low-wage workers doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game. In fact, the evidence suggests that everyone can win.\n\nNicole Hallett is an associate professor of law at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.
