But the support from two of its closest allies looks unlikely to resolve Cuba's pressing fuel problems, which have seen the government extend many of the energy-saving measures it has introduced over the past month.", "description": "Russian deputy prime minister in Venezuela to support Maduro", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF940L1_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
