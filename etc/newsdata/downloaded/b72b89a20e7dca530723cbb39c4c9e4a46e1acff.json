The Dubai businessman was friends with Epstein's co-investor, Andrew Farkas, a prominent New York developer, and his name appeared on contractual paperwork to sell the island for $22.5 million -- but with no signature from Sulayem.\n\nAfter the deal was closed on Jan. 28, 2016, Sulayem's name did not appear anywhere on subsequent documentation, including local land-use permits that revealed Epstein to be the sole member of the company that bought the island.\n\nThe wealthy financier attempted to renovate the newly acquired island without permits, resulting in a stop-work order and a fine of $70,000.\n\nThe inner workings of the Great St. James Cay acquisition are just another window into how Epstein managed to thwart the law and manipulate advantageous outcomes throughout his life.\n\nHe allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to sexually service his wealthy, high-profile friends on Little St. James Island that has been dubbed \u201cOrgy Island,\" featuring towering palm trees, a helicopter pad and multiple buildings.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEpstein committed suicide at a New York City prison in August while awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges; prosecutors allege he paid girls as young as 14-years-old hundreds of dollars in cash for massages before molesting them at his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., from 2002 through 2005.", "description": "Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein used the name of a wealthy Dubai businessman, allegedly without his permission, to acquire a second island in the Caribbean that the owner didn't want him to have.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
