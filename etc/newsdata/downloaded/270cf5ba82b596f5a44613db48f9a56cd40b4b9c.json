Trump\u2019s problem was an indicted Turkish-Iranian gold trader named Reza Zarrab. More precisely, the problem was Zarrab\u2019s lawyer, the president\u2019s close friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\nInvestigators suspected Zarrab was working on behalf of the Turkish government\u2019s state-owned bank Halkbank as part of a massive scheme to funnel billions of dollars into Iran in contravention of American economic sanctions. They wanted Zarrab to spill what he knew. Giuliani was in a panic.\n\nTrump bluntly asked Tillerson to pressure the Department of Justice into ending its investigation of Zarrab. Tillerson flatly refused, even raising his concerns about the criminality of Trump\u2019s request with then-Chief of Staff John Kelly. And yet, faced with a clear order to obstruct a federal investigation, neither Tillerson nor Kelly took any steps to report Trump\u2019s request.\n\n\u2018Angry\u2019 Rex Tillerson Says Jared Kushner Hijacked U.S. Foreign Policy\n\nZarrab\u2019s case wasn\u2019t even the first time Trump tried to push Tillerson into breaking the law for Trump\u2019s own benefit. Speaking with Bob Schieffer last year, Tillerson said, \u201cSo often, the president would say \u2018Here\u2019s what I want to do and here\u2019s how I want to do it,\u2019 and I would have to say to him, \u2018Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can\u2019t do it that way. It violates the law, it violates treaty, you know, and he just, he got really frustrated when we\u2019d have those conversations.\u201d\n\nSince the earliest days of his presidency, Trump has attempted to circumvent and weaken the policymaking and legal frameworks that provide accountability to federal acts. And no pillar of the federal government has received more of Trump\u2019s concentrated disdain than the State Department, once the American government\u2019s most venerable institution. Trump\u2019s wildcat-style diplomacy collided with the State Department almost immediately\u2014and as Trump has succeeded in hobbling State, so has he hobbled the most effective checks on his self-dealing and corruption.\n\nCareer FSOs, some with more than 20 years of professional service navigating the pitfalls and traps of international diplomacy, are speaking out against Trump\u2019s brash, just-wing-it brand of diplomatic negotiations. They remark with concern that Trump\u2019s persecution of his own diplomats saps our pool of talented officers while weakening American messaging abroad.\n\n\u201cI watched the administration lurch even further these past two years toward a worldview characterized by bigotry, fear and small-minded chauvinism,\u201d wrote 11-year Foreign Service veteran Bethany Milton in a New York Times op-ed explaining her sudden resignation. \u201cWhat of the administration\u2019s policies is there left to defend to foreign audiences?\u201d\n\nMilton isn\u2019t alone in her defeatism. Long-time diplomat Chuck Park wrote in The Washington Post that he could \u201cno longer justify being a part of Trump\u2019s \u2018complacent state.\u2019 Others have followed suit. As a result, the once prestigious Foreign Service has atrophied both within and without: in 2010, nearly 23,000 Americans took the Foreign Service Officer Test. By 2018, fewer than 9,000 applied.\n\nNowhere is the collapse of the State Department more visible than in the rise of the Trumpian \u201cpseudo-diplomat,\u201d normally a close Trump friend or family member with no formal government job, dispatched in secret to conduct opaque \u201cnegotiations\u201d with a raft of questionable foreign leaders. Since 2017, a greater share of key diplomatic efforts are undertaken not by trained envoys bound by State Department regulations, but by amateurs more willing to give the president his way.\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s shady attempt to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine fits the bill. So does Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s much-mocked attempts to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and solve American immigration standoffs with Latin American nations.\n\nAt the United Nations General Assembly last month, America\u2019s most visible diplomat wasn\u2019t U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft\u2014it was on-again-off-again foreign adviser Ivanka Trump, who had already caused controversy after trying to elbow her way into a high-level G20 discussion between French President Emmanuel Macron and the leaders of Britain, Canada and the International Monetary Fund. It didn\u2019t go well.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily BeastIn late 2017, President Donald Trump asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson a simple question: can you make a problem go away?
