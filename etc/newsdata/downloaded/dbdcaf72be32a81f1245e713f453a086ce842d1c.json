Speaking to the Commons, Johnson criticized the court judgment, and said voters wanted politicians to deliver Brexit by the end of October -- without a deal if necessary.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson offers to make time for opposition parties to hold a vote of no-confidence in his government on ThursdayJohnson says public wants Brexit with a deal if possible and without one if necessaryJohnson: Supreme Court was wrong to pronounce on suspension of ParliamentCabinet minister Michael Gove sees progress in Brexit talks, but European Union says British proposals unsatisfactoryThe Pound fell 1%The Day After Brexit: What a Crash Out of the EU Might Look Like\n\nJohnson Faces Backlash Over \u2018Humbug\u2019 Remark (9:30 p.m.)\n\nIn the House of Commons, opposition members of Parliament have been outraged by Boris Johnson\u2019s description of the law -- dubbed the Benn-Burt bill after the MPs who proposed it -- to prevent a no-deal Brexit as a \u201csurrender bill.\u201d Pressed to change his language, he called it a \u201ccapitulation\u201d bill, and said it has weakened his negotiating position with the European Union.\n\nLabour MP Paula Sherriff then demanded he stop using \u201cpejorative\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d language that, she said, incited violence and death threats against lawmakers. She pointed to the plaque behind her for Jo Cox, the pro-Remain Labour MP murdered during the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nJohnson replied: \u201cI have never heard so much humbug in my life,\u201d adding the best way to cool tensions in the country is to get Brexit done. That has triggered widespread anger on Twitter from politicians and his widower, Brendan Cox.\n\nNo Sign of Opposition Seeking Confidence Vote (9 p.m.)\n\nThere\u2019s no sign yet of any of the opposition parties taking Boris Johnson up on his offer for them to propose a vote of no confidence in his government. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wants an election, but will not countenance one until a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 has been ruled out.\n\nThe Scottish National Party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, suggested to the House of Commons that he wanted to \u201cunite\u201d the opposition \u201cto trigger a vote of no confidence to bring this chaotic government down,\u201d but later issued a statement laying out a position broadly in line with Corbyn.\n\nLiberal Democrat Party Leader Jo Swinson made no mention of the offer in an intervention demanding Johnson apologize to the House of Commons over the Supreme Court ruling. The party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said in a text message the Liberal Democrats are \u201cfocused on securing the extension before any other option such as a confidence motion.\u201d\n\nJohnson: Still \u2018Difficult Issues\u2019 in Border Talks (8:15 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson said he discussed so-called alternative arrangements for the post-Brexit border with Ireland with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on Monday -- but warned that there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n\u201cIt would be over-optimistic to say that that alone can solve the problem,\u201d Johnson told the House of Commons. \u201cThere remain difficult issues about customs and we must make progress on that issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlternative arrangements\u201d is the term for methods including trusted trader programs and checks away from the border designed to replace the contentious backstop provision in the Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n\nJohnson Won\u2019t Quit If He Loses Confidence Vote (7:50 p.m.)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson won\u2019t stand down if his government loses a no-confidence vote, his spokesman James Slack told reporters. \u201cI have seen absolutely nothing to suggest that the prime minister would resign,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, if the government loses such a vote, the premier and other parties have 14 days to win another confidence vote. If no one does so, a general election is triggered. Another spokesman declined to say how Johnson\u2019s Conservatives would vote, stressing that while they had confidence in the premier, the vote could be tactical.\n\nThe spokesman also wouldn\u2019t rule out the government suspending Parliament again. He also said the Conservative Party conference will go ahead next week, and that Johnson will speak at it, even if opposition parties refuse to heed convention and approve a parliamentary recess.\n\nPM Challenges Opposition to Call Confidence Vote (6:44 p.m.)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson challenged the opposition parties to call a vote of confidence in his government as he sought again to force a general election.\n\nJohnson threw down the gauntlet to opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, telling him he has until the Commons closes for business on Wednesday to propose a motion of no confidence in the government. He also told minor opposition parties that they too could do so, and the government would ensure there was time to debate it.\n\nAfter opposition parties twice rejected an attempt by Johnson to force an early general election, a confidence vote would offer Johnson another path to national poll.\n\nIf he loses such a vote, the House of Commons will have 14 days in which to form an alternative government, and if it fails to do so, an election will follow.\n\n\u201cThis parliament must either stand aside and let this government get Brexit done or bring a vote of confidence and finally face a day of reckoning with the voters,\u201d Johnson told the Commons on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson Attacks Supreme Court as \u2018Wrong\u2019 (6:37 p.m.)\n\nJohnson said the Supreme Court was asked to intervene in this process of suspending Parliament for the first time ever. The premier insisted he meant no disrespect to judiciary, before slamming the judges\u2019 ruling. \u201cI think the court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson Says EU Talks are Advancing (6:35 p.m.)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told the house of Commons that he\u2019s made progress in the talks.\n\nSixty-four days ago, he said, \u201cI was told that Brussels would never reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. We are now discussing the Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d He added that the he\u2019s now discussing with EU counterparts alternatives to the Irish backstop, and arrangements that aren\u2019t permanent, contrary to warnings he\u2019d been given when he started the job.\n\nEU Says U.K. Ideas Unacceptable (6 p.m.)\n\nThe British government\u2019s latest ideas for the post-Brexit Irish border aren\u2019t acceptable, the European Commission said on Wednesday at a confidential briefing of national diplomats.\n\nLast week\u2019s three discussion documents, and an additional one looking at how to deal with goods between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, are unsatisfactory and insufficient to replace the so-called backstop, according to officials at the meeting.\n\nIn truth, very little has happened in the negotiations over the past couple of weeks -- the Commission\u2019s criticism of the U.K. ideas hasn\u2019t changed in that time. It wants the British government to put forward more concrete proposals sooner rather than later.\n\nJohnson to Address Tory MPs on Thursday (5:25 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson will address the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative members of Parliament at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, a U.K. official said.\n\nGove Swerves Questions About No-Deal Planning (4.20 p.m.)\n\nMichael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, has swerved question after question in the House of Commons about the details.\n\nWhether it was on shortages of medical supplies or the fears that queues of trucks will block the roads, he replied by assuring Parliament that the matter was in hand, and stopped there.\n\nHe was also asked repeatedly at what point the government stopped referring to the no-deal forecasts revealed earlier this month as \u201cbase case\u201d and started calling them \u201cworst case,\u201d something he refused to say.\n\nGove Sees \u2018Significant Progress\u2019 in Brexit Talks (3:25 p.m.)\n\nMichael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, told the House of Commons on Wednesday that there has been \u201csignificant movement over recent weeks\u201d in the negotiations with the European Union.\n\n\u201cUntil recently the European Union has maintained that the Withdrawal Agreement was sacrosanct: now they have acknowledged it can be changed,\u201d Gove said. \u201cUp until this point the European Union have also said that the Backstop was inviolable. But again, European leaders have said that they are not emotionally attached to the backstop.\u201d\n\nHis optimism appeared at odds with comments from Guy Verhofstadt (see 3 p.m.) and Simon Coveney (see 2 p.m.).\n\nVerhofstadt Slams U.K.\u2019s Backstop Ideas (3 p.m.)\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, says U.K. discussion papers about replacing the Irish border backstop don\u2019t go far enough and are only a \u201cpartial response.\u201d\n\nThe documents, which were sent to EU negotiators, are \u201cnot a fully fledged legally operable alternative,\u201d the former Belgian prime minister told the European Parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to say the backstop can fall and we put this partial proposal in place of this full backstop.\u201d\n\nTechnical negotiations are continuing in Brussels this week but EU officials say little progress has been made.\n\n\u2018Johnson Did Nothing Improper\u2019 Over Funding (2:10 p.m.)\n\nMatt Warman, on his first appearance as a culture minister in the House of Commons, found himself defending publicly-funded grants given to a business run by a friend of Boris Johnson\u2019s.\n\nMembers of Parliament also asked about reports in the Sunday Times newspaper that Johnson had arranged for U.S. businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, a technology entrepreneur, to join him on trade missions. Warman said a review of the funding process is underway.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that the prime minister did anything improper,\u201d Warman said. \u201cWe are having a review and we will make that public.\u201d\n\nThe SNP\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Hara said the allegations add to \u201ca stench of sleaze and scandal currently engulfing the prime minister.\u201d\n\nU.K. Border Proposals \u2018Fanciful,\u2019 Irish Say (2 p.m.)\n\nSpeaking in New York, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the U.K.\u2019s proposals to break the Brexit deadlock have been \u201cfanciful,\u201d according to a tweet from Elaine Loughlin, a reporter with the Irish Examiner.\n\nCoveney appeared to be striking a tougher tone than that of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who last night appeared to offer some glimmer of hopes that progress was being made after his meeting with Boris Johnson.\n\nElection Motion Coming \u2018Shortly,\u2019 Cox Says (1:10 p.m.)\n\nAsked by Scottish National Party MP Patricia Gibson why the prime minister won\u2019t resign, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox replied that she\u2019ll soon have a chance to get her wish.\n\nHe then may have inadvertently let slip part of Boris Johnson\u2019s plans, when he said members of Parliament will soon get the chance to vote on an election motion.\n\n\u201cCan I encourage her to vote for the election motion that will be coming before the house shortly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way she can ensure that what she hopes, what she thinks, no doubt will take place.\u201d\n\nCox: Politicians Could Vet Judges in Future (1 p.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox risked escalating the war of words between the government and the judiciary over Brexit. He said the Supreme Court had made new law in its ruling on Tuesday -- and then suggested Parliament may decide it needs to vet the appointment of judges in future.\n\n\u201cI do think that we are going to have to look again at our constitutional arrangements,\u201d Cox said. \u201cOne matter may very well be whether there will need to be parliamentary scrutiny of judicial appointments in some manner.\u201d\n\nHe said he is \u201cnot enthusiastic\u201d about the prospect of such a development taking place over the months and years ahead. The backlash from lawyers and judges is likely to be far stronger.\n\nCox Suggests Wriggle Room on Brexit Law (12:50 p.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox suggested there may be wriggle room around the law requiring Boris Johnson to delay Brexit if he can\u2019t get Parliament to either approve a deal or a no-deal departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThere is a question as to precisely what obligations the law might require of the government,\u201d Cox said. \u201cBut once those obligations are ascertained with clarity, and I\u2019m not saying that they aren\u2019t clear, I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s a legitimate consideration the government must go through, the government will obey them.\u201d\n\nCox was responding to a question about whether the government was seeking to break the law, which was passed by Parliament earlier this month. He refused to say if he\u2019s been asked to provide the government with legal advice on the matter, saying attorneys general \u201ccannot disclose either the fact or content of any advice.\u201d\n\nTories Turn their Fire on Johnson\u2019s Aide (12.30 p.m.)\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s Supreme Court defeat, MPs in his own party are turning their fire on Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s senior aide. Two former cabinet ministers \u2013 and an adviser to a third -- told Bloomberg Cummings should go for his role in the prorogation of Parliament that the court ruled unlawful.\n\nOne of them noted that after Theresa May\u2019s gambit of calling a snap election in 2017 deprived her of the Tory majority, her top two aides lost their jobs. Neither former minister thought Johnson himself should quit.\n\nCox Suggests Simple Law to Call Election (12:20 p.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox offered the opposition Labour Party the opportunity to force an election through a short bill requiring just a simple majority in Parliament.\n\n\u201cAll we need -- I offer this to the front bench of the Labour Party -- all we need is a one-line bill that we could put through with the speaker\u2019s help, fixing the date of a general election by a simple majority, and we could have the election,\u201d Cox told the House of Commons.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time a Government minister has openly voiced the idea, which has been circulating around Westminster for the past month.\n\nThe plan would circumvent the only other paths to a general election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act: Either through a vote requiring a 2/3 majority in Parliament, or following a government losing a confidence vote and no one else being able to form a new administration within two weeks.\n\nCox Says Current Parliament is Dead (12:10 p.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox launched a scathing attack on opposition MPs for failing to pass Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and then refusing to have a general election.\n\n\u201cThis Parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches,\u201d he told the House of Commons. \u201cThis Parliament should have the courage to face the electorate, but it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhile Cox concentrated his fire on the Labour Party, there were current cabinet members who also refused to back May\u2019s deal earlier this year.\n\nCox: Any further Suspension Will Comply With Law (12 p.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox said if the government does choose to suspend Parliament again, it will comply with the law. \u201cThere will be no prorogation that doesn\u2019t comply with the terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court,\u201d he told the House of Commons.\n\nHe was responding to a question from former minister Oliver Letwin seeking a guarantee that the government won\u2019t suspend Parliament between now and the current Oct. 31 Brexit deadline \u201csave potentially a few days before a Queen\u2019s Speech.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strong hint that the government plans to suspend Parliament again in order to set out a new legislative agenda before the end of next month \u2013 albeit this time for only a few days rather than the 5-week period declared unlawful by the Supreme Court.\n\nCox Defends Independence of Courts (11:50 a.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox added his voice to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland (see 9:55 a.m.) as he defended the independence of the judges in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a constitutional coup,\u201d he said in response to a question about the reported comments of Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was sitting alongside him as he answered questions from MPs. He said the comments were \u201crhetorical and poetical license.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudges are both impartial and independent and they are entitled to reach the view that they have reached,\u201d he told the House of Commons.\n\nAnd in a robust defense of the legal system and his advice to ministers, he reminded lawmakers that good lawyers often find themselves on the losing side. He had won in a number of courts before the cases reached the Supreme Court, he said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is this advice was sound advice at the time.\u201d\n\nCox Says Government Accepts Court Decision (11:40 a.m.)\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox said the government accepts the \u201cdefinitive and final\u201d ruling of the Supreme Court. \u201cAt all times the government acted in good faith,\u201d he told the House of Commons, to jeering from the opposition benches.\n\nCox said he is considering whether to publish the advice given to the government on suspending Parliament. \u201cI will consider over the coming days whether the public interest might require a greater disclosure of the advice given to the government on this subject,\u201d he said.\n\nA leaked version of the advice, reported by Sky News on Tuesday, showed Cox saying that the move was lawful.\n\nJohnson to Set Out Next Steps (11:10 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson will set out his next steps -- including whether he still wants to hold a Queen\u2019s Speech on Oct. 14 -- when he addresses lawmakers in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, his spokeswoman Alison Donnelly told reporters in London.\n\nJohnson\u2019s team are still considering the implications of the Supreme Court judgment and the prime minister \u201cabsolutely\u201d still has confidence in Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, Donnelly said.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons John Bercow has granted two urgent questions, according to Labour business managers, so Johnson\u2019s statement is now not likely to happen until about 5 p.m.\n\nJohnson to Address MPs as Storm Rages (10:45 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson will make a statement to Parliament later on Wednesday after flying in from New York overnight.\n\nWhen Parliament resumes at 11:30 a.m. there will first be a statement on the collapse of Thomas Cook by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, followed by a statement from No-Deal Brexit Minister Michael Gove, according to business managers from the opposition Labour Party.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab will then update the House on Iran before Johnson appears before MPs. After Johnson, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg will make a statement on future business, the Labour Whips said on Twitter.\n\nJohnson Lands, Readies For Hostile Reception (10:20 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson has arrived back at Heathrow airport, where a motorcade was waiting to whisk him into central London.\n\nLess than eight hours earlier, he was addressing a polite late-evening audience at the United Nations on the subject of the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. The reception in Parliament is likely to be significantly more hostile.\n\nRebuke for Ministers Straying Off Message (9:55 a.m.)\n\nDisagreements among Boris Johnson\u2019s top team were laid bare when Justice Secretary Robert Buckland reminded his colleagues of the need to support the judiciary, after a series of attacks on Tuesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cWe must all remember that our world-class judiciary always acts free from political motivation or influence and that the rule of law is the basis of our democracy, for all seasons,\u201d Buckland said Wednesday on Twitter. \u201cPersonal attacks on judges from any quarter are completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg told a cabinet conference call on Tuesday the ruling amounted to a constitutional coup, according to two people familiar with the conversation. On Wednesday, Michael Gove told BBC radio that respectable lawyers say the court was wrong (see Earlier).\n\nGlimmers of Hope on Brexit Deal? (9:30 a.m.)\n\nIt may not be all doom and gloom for Boris Johnson. A few hours after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that he\u2019d broken the law by suspending Parliament, the British prime minister held his second meeting within a month with his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar.\n\nOn the surface, little seems to have changed, with Varadkar saying the gap between the two sides remains wide.\n\nBut he also said the encounter was \u201cgood\u201d and that the pair would meet again \u201cvery soon,\u201d suggesting the pace of engagement is quickening. The thorny question of how Northern Ireland might be given a say in any Brexit deal was discussed, pointing to some potential movement.\n\nUltimately, the discussions may lead nowhere -- and Tuesday\u2019s court decision gives Ireland little reason to offer concessions anytime soon. But Varadkar\u2019s tone suggested all is not lost just yet.\n\nCorbyn to Pursue Election Once No-Deal Risk Over (8:30 a.m.)\n\nOpposition Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn said he would be prepared to support Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for an early general election, but only after the government has applied for a Brexit extension, per legislation passed by Parliament, in the event he can\u2019t reach a deal with Brussels. Under the law, an election would follow 25 working days later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to have a general election when we\u2019ve taken no-deal off the table,\u201d Corbyn told BBC Radio 4. If the government applies for an extension and is granted one by the EU, that would \u201cbe a step forward,\u201d he said.\n\nParliament resumes in London on Wednesday, but by convention, the legislature would be in recess while the Conservatives hold their annual conference in Manchester next week. Corbyn, who delivered the keynote speech to his own party\u2019s conference on Tuesday, said he would refuse to allow another suspension of Parliament for the Tories to hold theirs.\n\nCorbyn also called on Johnson to apologize to Queen Elizabeth II for giving her unlawful advice to suspend Parliament, \u201cbut more importantly apologize to the British people for what he\u2019s done in trying to shut down our democracy at a very crucial time, he said.\n\nGove: Respectable Lawyers Say Court Is Wrong (Earlier)\n\nMichael Gove, the U.K. minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, said there is respectable legal opinion that disagrees with the ruling of the Supreme Court on the suspension of Parliament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly possible to disagree with with some of the reasoning but to respect the rule of law,\u201d Gove told BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday. His comments come after fellow Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg attacked the ruling on a conference call with Boris Johnson and other ministers, calling it a constitutional coup, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSignificantly, Gove also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of another suspension to allow a new session of Parliament to begin, saying the government wants to pursue its domestic agenda. He said the government would lay out its proposals to Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nSNP Indicates Support for Corbyn as Interim PM (Earlier)\n\nIan Blackford, Westminster leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party -- which is pushing the most strongly for an immediate general election -- suggested in a BBC radio interview he could support Jeremy Corbyn as a temporary, interim prime minister to oversee an election.\n\nMeanwhile, Liberal Democrat Deputy leader Ed Davey proposed veteran MPs Harriet Harman for Labour, or Ken Clarke for the Tories, as a temporary solution for a cross-party government of national unity. For his part, Clarke told BBC radio that rather than discussing candidates, Parliament should be focusing on what any interim leader is trying to achieve.\n\nEarlier:\n\nJohnson Flies Into His Gravest Crisis After Brexit Court DefeatBoris Johnson\u2019s Big Brexit Gamble Has Plainly Failed: EditorialThe Day After Brexit: What a Crash Out of the EU Might Look LikeBoris Johnson Caught in the Supreme Court\u2019s Constitutional Web\n\n--With assistance from Thomas Penny, Dara Doyle, Kitty Donaldson, Ian Wishart, Jessica Shankleman and Robert Hutton.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net;Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Thomas Penny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson, facing the biggest political crisis of his career, is addressing Parliament for the first time since Britain\u2019s Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend the legislature was illegal.He has offered all opposition political parties the chance to trigger a formal", "authors": ["Alex Morales", "Tim Ross"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8qS2MokBasX5CldZH5imjQ--~B/aD05Nzk7dz0xNDY5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/55b12b204023a2e87b8de19c0ab9749b"}
