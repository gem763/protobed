If a fight came, I definitely did have natural ability for combat. I have natural instincts and talent,' he said.\n\n'There is so much culture in the sport, history and discipline. Looking back I was always drawn to combat, even if I'm afraid of spiders, heights, but I wasn't a kid who went looking for fights.'", "description": "Robert Whittaker and\u00a0Israel Adesanya have entered the octagon for their hotly-anticipated UFC bout.", "authors": ["Nic White", "Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/06/19352448-0-image-a-34_1570338814950.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
