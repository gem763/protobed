the most widely known of which is valsartan - leading to worldwide recalls and shortages, despite the FDA's statement that the drug poses limited risks.\n\n'There have been no adverse events' linked to Zantac, Dr Inna Hussain, head of laryngology at Rush University Medical Center told DailyMail.com.\n\n'The concern is that at high enough doses, NDMA can be carcinogenic, but what does isn't clear.'\n\nWe don't know yet if NDMA got into ranitidine during its production or if the toxin is a byproduct of the drug itself.\n\nIt could be that Zantac 'is breaking down and becoming NDMA, which is much more concerning,' said Dr Hussain.\n\nShe notes that it's those who use the drug continuously for the management of chronic heartburn who are likely to be at the greatest risk.\n\nWHERE WAS ZANTAC ALREADY RECALLED AND WHY IT STAYED ON US SHELVES SO LONG\n\nThe level of the chemical that the FDA considers 'unacceptable' is still low and, in fact, it was initially detected at alarming levels when an private pharmacy group used a more sensitive test on the samples of the drug.\n\nThe FDA then adjusted its own testing, found lower levels than that pharmacy, but high enough doses to exceed their threshold for safety, and advised company's making the drug perform similar tests.\n\nA UK watchdog group announces Tuesday that GSK was recalling four of its forms of prescription Zantac: Zantac 150mg/10ml Syrup, Zantac 50mg/2ml Injection, Zantac 150mg Tablets and Zantac 300mg Tablets.\n\nGSK recalled the products worldwide.\n\nOther variation on the products were not recalled and can still be bought over the counter in the UK.\n\nIn the US, many makers of generic ranitidine, including pharmaceutical giants Apotex and Sandoz, have voluntarily recalled their heartburn drugs.\n\nBut Sanofi, which produces and sells brand-name Zantac, hasn't budged.\n\nAs far as the company is concerned, its drugs can remain on the shelves, though retail giants CVS, Walmart and Rite-Aid have all pulled Zantac of their own volition.\n\nIn fact, Sanofi seems to have said nothing more than its initial statement that it 'takes patient safety seriously and [is] committed to working with the FDA.'\n\n'There are currently no plans to stop distributing or manufacturing Zantac or other Ranitidine products outside of Canada,' where officials issued a mandatory recall, said a Sanofi spokesperson in an email to DailyMail.com.\n\n'The levels of NDMA found in ranitidine in preliminary tests barely exceed amounts found in common foods, we have no reason to believe that a recall is necessary at this point.\"\n\nFor now, the FDA is not advising anyone to stop taking the over-the-counter drug, but suggested that patients whose doctors had prescribed the Zantac or ranitidine should speak to their doctors about alternatives.\n\nALTERNATIVES TO CANCER-LINKED ZANTAC FOR HEARTBURN Zantac and its active ingredient, ranitidine are members of a class of drugs called H2 blockers. In recent years, doctors have preferred to prescribe this group of this drugs for patients with less severe heartburn. Aside from ranitidine, or Zantac, patients can also take: Nizatidine (known by the brand name Axide)\n\nFamotidine (sold as Pepcid and Pepcid AC) and\n\nCimetidine (sold as Taagamet and Tagemet HB) These drugs all block certain receptors that trigger the release of stomach acid. Although the FDA is now investigating heartburn drugs broadly, there have not yet been reports of NDMA linked to any of the other H2 blockers. The other most commonly-used class of drug for heartburn is proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). These include: The blockbuster 'purple pill,' Nexium (sold generically as esomeprazole magnesium)\n\nPirlosec (omeprazole)\n\nlansoprazole (Prevacid)\n\nPantoprazole (Protonix) PPIs block the final stage of acid production in the stomach, helping soothe symptoms for reflux sufferers. These are highly effective and are recommended for people with more severe acid reflux as they reduce the risks for developing complications, like esophageal cancer, that can arise if the condition persists, untreated. But they interfere with he way the body absorbs nutrients like magnesium and B12 and people that are on high doses for too long may be at higher risk for C diff infections and kidney disease. 'We need to take a step back and say \"why are people on this any way when there are more natural ways to treat symptoms?\"' said Dr Hussain. She noted that dietary changes, making sure to leave plenty of time between dinner and going to bed and wearing lighter, looser garments can help keep acid from pushing up from our stomachs. and causing heartburn. There's even an all natural treatment that uses algae to fight heartburn, called Reflux Gourmet, which she suggests to many patients. And many don't really need to treat a gastric issue, but simply the occasional symptoms. 'There's a different category of medications for active symptoms of heart burn, and the best thing is Tums because that works immediate, but you would take them to stop it, but not to prevent heartburn,' said Dr Hussain.\n\n\n\n", "description": "More than a month after GSK, which sells Zantac outside the US, recalled the popular heartburn drug worldwide, its US seller, Sanofi, finally recalled its over-the-counter and prescription drugs Friday.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/20/19107402-0-image-a-40_1571428500403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
