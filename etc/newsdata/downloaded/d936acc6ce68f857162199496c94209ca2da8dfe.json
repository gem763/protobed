John Bel Edwards of taking a hostile attitude toward a significant slice of the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nRep. Ralph Abraham, one of two GOP candidates looking to unseat the incumbent governor this year, is running an ad saying Mr. Edwards has \u201cdeclared war\u201d on the oil sector, saying it\u2019s gone largely dormant and employs far fewer people than it did when Mr. Edwards won his office in 2015.\n\n\u201cThat ends the day I\u2019m elected governor,\u201d Mr. Abraham says after a quick clip of Mr. Edwards laughing demonically over some unrelated event.\n\nThe governor\u2019s campaign says if anyone\u2019s hostile it\u2019s the congressman, saying \u201conly one candidate has sued\u201d the oil and gas industry \u2014 Mr. Abraham. That\u2019s a reference to a lawsuit that was not directed against the industry itself and had nothing to do with coastal erosion; instead it concerned a botched subcontractor on a homeowner property issue, according to the Abraham camp.\n\nThe back-and-forth taps into a nostalgia for the cash the oil economy used to mean for the state \u2014 though the unanimity of support has broken down recently as some blame it for the deterioration of Louisiana\u2019s marshy coast where it meets the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe industry contends it employs more than a quarter-million people in Louisiana and contributes more than $72 billion annually to the state\u2019s economy, but it has suffered somewhat as fracking and other new production methods have caused a boom in other states.\n\nLast year, economic forecasters at Louisiana State University sliced their estimates for job growth in the sector, citing \u201cgeopolitical forces,\u201d along with price swings in the market.\n\nThe Edwards campaign disputed the challenger\u2019s contention the sector has slumped.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the Louisiana Office of Conservation issued more oil and gas permits than in 2015 under Bobby Jindal, who Ralph Abraham said did \u2018an outstanding job\u2019 on the economy,\u201d said Eric Holl, a spokesman for the Edwards campaign. \u201cIn fact, in the last fiscal year Louisiana received more in-state leasing than the previous three years combined. And our natural gas industry is booming.\u201d\n\nEddie Rispone, a Republican businessman who\u2019s also in the race \u2014 under Louisiana\u2019s \u201cjungle primary\u201d system, all candidates run against each other regardless of party and the top two run off if nobody gets a majority of votes \u2014 says Mr. Edwards is the proper target, saying he\u2019s being funded by another industry that\u2019s anathema to the oil men.\n\n\u201cGov. Edwards and this trial lawyer allies who have bankrolled his campaign are responsible for Louisiana losing thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry,\u201d Mr. Rispone told The Washington Times. \u201cThe lawsuit abuse and their assault on oil and gas ends the day I am elected governor.\u201d\n\nThat charge dates back to September 2016 when Mr. Edwards sent an unusual letter to several parishes, some of whom had joined an earlier lawsuit against energy companies that had been tossed out of court, telling them bluntly that if they didn\u2019t launch a crusade against energy companies in courts, the state would.\n\nThe field marshals of this legal assault would be a coterie of trial lawyers who have been some of Mr. Edwards biggest campaign contributors. Led by the Baton Rouge firm of Talbot, Carmouche & Marcello, the trial lawyers and some elected Louisiana officials envision billions in payouts, settlements they believe would match the bonanzas reaped in tobacco or BP litigation.\n\nFueling the GOP\u2019s suspicions, the trial lawyers have formed Gumbo PAC to pool their resources on Mr. Edwards\u2019 behalf.\n\nThe marking and lobbying arms of the energy sector, meanwhile, have adopted an \u201canyone but Edwards\u201d stance, issuing a dual endorsement of Mr. Abraham and Mr. Rispone.\n\n\u201cVoters have a very clear choice here,\u201d said Melissa Landry, an independent consultant in Louisiana who has worked closely with the oil and gas industry for years. \u201cBoth [GOP candidates] have positioned themselves in pretty stark contrast to the governor\u2019s position, not only in terms of the litigation but also in terms of encouraging jobs and economic growth.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s widely accepted the energy sector shares some blame for Louisiana\u2019s significant coastal erosion issues, particularly now that barrier islands in the Gulf have largely disappeared, experts debate its responsibility when compared with other factors, such as government twisting of the Mississippi River\u2019s course that ruined its natural delta outlet.\n\nMr. Rispone and Mr. Abraham are expected to press the issue against Mr. Edwards later this month at the Southern Energy Conference in Lafayette, an event organized by the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association and the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, the primary industry groups.\n\nLOGA and LMOGA, as they are known, also invited Mr. Edwards to their gubernatorial forum on Sept. 18 but the governor is slated to attend a fundraiser in Atlanta instead.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
