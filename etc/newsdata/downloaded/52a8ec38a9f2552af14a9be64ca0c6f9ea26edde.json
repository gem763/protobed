Microsoft did not reveal which presidential campaign was targeted.\n\nDuring 30 days between August and September, Microsoft detected more than 2,700 attempts by a group known as Phosphorus to identify specific Microsoft email accounts. The group attacked 241 of those accounts and successfully compromised four of them. The compromised accounts were not ones associated with a U.S. presidential campaign or current and former government officials, according to the company.\n\nDuring the 2016 election cycle, Russian national hackers obtained thousands of internal emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cWhile the attacks we\u2019re disclosing today were not technically sophisticated, they attempted to use a significant amount of personal information both to identify the accounts belonging to their intended targets and in a few cases to attempt attacks,\u201d Burt said. \u201cThis effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering.\u201d\n\nCompanies with products requiring cybersecurity, such as social media platforms, have come under pressure since the 2016 election to strengthen security measures and practice greater transparency after some became breeding grounds for misinformation campaigns, and some users\u2019 data was stolen.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we all \u2013 governments and private sector \u2013 are increasingly transparent about nation-state attacks and efforts to disrupt democratic processes,\u201d Microsoft said.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller and former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats have both warned that future election meddling from foreign governments is imminent, including from Iran and China.", "description": "Hackers believed to be linked to Iran's government have attempted to breach hundreds of email accounts associated with journalists, government officials, and a U.S. presidential campaign, Microsoft said Friday.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
