He is great with our Vets, the Military, and your very important Second Amendment. Strong on Crime and the Border, Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of Nebraska. He is great with our Vets, the Military, and your very important Second Amendment. Strong on Crime and the Border, Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nHowever, Mr. Trump has derided Mr. Sasse in the past and the Nebraska senator has proudly reciprocated, despite being one of the chamber\u2019s most consrvative members.\n\nFor example, in a January 2016 tweet cited by the Hill, Mr. Trump said Nebraska \u201ccan do much better than Ben Sasse as your Senator. Saw him on [Greta Van Susteren\u2019s Fox show] - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.\u201d\n\nThe great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2016\n\nFor his part, Mr. Sasse, despite having the second-highest score in the Senate from the American Conservative Union, has repeatedly blasted Mr. Trump as amoral and immoral, refused to vote for him in 2016, and has compared him to white supremacist David Duke.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
