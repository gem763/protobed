(She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)\n\nThe show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you mourning quietly?\u201d asks Adam, Hannah\u2019s boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editor\u2019s obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called \u201cAnd Now They\u2019re Dead.\u201d Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer L\u2019Wren Scott\u2019s suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.\n\nMs. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, \u2018How can I really help?\u2019 It would be great if everyone said, \u2018Can I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast February, on what would have been Ms. Rosenthal\u2019s 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friend\u2019s Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. \u201cA lot of what she wrote wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cBecca\u2019s mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.\u201d Ms. Feldman\u2019s explanation for that kind of behavior is \u201cperformative grief,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, \u2018look at me\u2019 behavior.\u201d On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, \u201d said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.\n\nThen there\u2019s the lingua franca of social media \u2014 the like button \u2014 that\u2019s totally discordant with death. \u201cMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing \u2018136 people like this\u2019 underneath?\u201d Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a \u201csympathize button,\u201d something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)", "description": "Expressions of grief take on many public forms in the digital age.", "authors": ["Hannah Seligson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/fashion/23MODERNLOSS_SPAN/23MODERNLOSS-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2014-03-23"}
