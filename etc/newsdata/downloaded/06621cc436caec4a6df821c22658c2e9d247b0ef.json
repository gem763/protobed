She works part-time jobs while writing fantasy novels. She\u2019s blocked the president on Twitter TWTR, -1.37% and, despite her parlous financial condition, she hopes to eventually be in a position to donate to a charity fighting global warming.\n\nBut if she can last another four months without a smartphone, she\u2019s looking at a fat payday of $100,000 courtesy of the Coca-Cola Co. KO, -2.87%.\n\n\u201cI [will] have to take a lie detector test,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an extremely anxious person, I\u2019ve been very rigid with the rules.\u201d\n\nLast winter, Mugdan won the \u201cNo Phone For A Year\u201d contest run by Coca-Cola\u2019s Vitaminwater. She\u2019s agreed to go a year without using a smartphone or any similar device, like a tablet. She\u2019s stuck with a flip phone.\n\nShe\u2019s two thirds of the way through the challenge: It began in February. She\u2019s looking good for the payoff. \u201cI\u2019ve detoxed completely from the smartphone and I don\u2019t need it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe biggest challenge I\u2019ve faced in the contest is other people pushing their phones at me. People are always trying to show me their phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to a decision: I do not want to go back to the smartphone when the year is over,\u201d she says. \u201cI have become 125% more productive without it. This year alone I\u2019ve read 30-plus books. [It\u2019s] made me a lot happier, and it\u2019s improved my sleep schedule. I\u2019m trying to repair some of the relationships that I let fall by the wayside. I\u2019ve made an effort to reconnect with people.\u201d\n\nWhen she looks back on her smartphone use, she is aghast. \u201cI was wasting time. I was basically doing nothing. I wasn\u2019t aware of how badly I was behaving with my smartphone until I had to relinquish [it]],\u201d she says. \u201cI was addicted to it. I definitely abused it.\u201d\n\nShe checked it out throughout the day, and kept the phone by her bed at night. Sometimes when she couldn\u2019t sleep she\u2019d be on her phone instead until 4 a.m.\n\nShe was hardly alone. Growing numbers of adults, and children, are hooked on their smartphones. Scientists are increasingly worried about the social and mental toll that\u2019s taking. Even Apple AAPL, -2.51% CEO Tim Cook has admitted publicly to spending too much time on his iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to go without a smartphone if you don\u2019t stray far from your neighborhood. But Mugdan recently went on a cross-country book tour to promote Dragon Child, the latest novel in her fantasy series.\n\nThink: No Google Maps GOOGL, -2.33% GOOG, -2.36%. No Email. No Uber UBER, -0.51% or Lyft LYFT, -2.98%. No airline or hotel apps. No weather updates. No GPS or directions.\n\n\u201cI generally have treated it as an adventure,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been printing instructions. I\u2019ve been planning ahead, which I never really had before.\u201d But, she acknowledges: \u201cI\u2019ve run into situations where it would have been much better for my personal safety if I had a smartphone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fewer than 13 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. But smartphones are now so ingrained in our life that, when Mugdan tells people she\u2019d dumped hers, they are typically stunned.\n\n\u201cPeople are floored,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first reaction is invariably shock; \u2018What, no phone? I could never do that.\u2019 But it very quickly becomes, \u2018I wish I could do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe last eight months has been a roller-coaster ride, she admits. First was the \u201choneymoon period,\u201d when she felt refreshed and liberated. Then came the book tour, when she appreciated all that she was missing. Now her view is more balanced: She sees the conveniences of smartphones, but also their hefty costs.\n\n\u201cThe technology is so useful when it\u2019s used correctly,\u201d she says. \u201cThe problem is, I didn\u2019t use it correctly, I abused it, and I suspect most other people do the same. You sacrifice a lot of freedom, privacy, individuality and thinking abilities for this small bit of convenience.\u201d\n\nFor Coca-Cola, it\u2019s been a cost-effective publicity stunt. It\u2019s been \u201cabsolutely a success,\u201d says company spokeswoman Aly Hite. For a trivial sum, the company got more than 100,000 contest entries, tons of media coverage, and a \u201c25,000%\u201d increase in web traffic to the brand\u2019s website.\n\nMugdan, however, is not one of those people. She checks things like email and Facebook FB, -0.69% only periodically on her laptop. When she goes out now, she is struck by how many people have their eyes glued to their phones, checking their notifications, even when they are in restaurants or cafes with other people.\n\nThe emails and notifications will still be there if you don\u2019t check them till later, she points out. \u201cBut if you miss a moment in the real world, it\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, she regrets all the time wasted. \u201cJust three hours a day of doing nothing. That\u2019s nearly 1,100 hours. I could have written a book in that time. But it\u2019s past, and I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d", "description": "Author Elana Mugdan is four months away from claiming the prize.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS512_arends_ZG_20191002154447.jpg"}
