Rescue efforts stalled by flooded vehicles and roads turned to rivers. Communications in ruins and basic infrastructure \u2014 including shelters, hospitals and public buildings \u2014 under water.\n\n\n\nAnd all around, vicious winds and crashing waves brought on by Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms recorded in the Atlantic, whipped the low-lying islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama in the northwestern Bahamas for a second day on Tuesday.\n\nThe true extent of Dorian\u2019s toll was only beginning to emerge as the storm began to pull away.\n\nEntire neighborhoods were reduced to unrecognizable fields of rubble, houses were crushed into splinters and boats were tossed into heaps like toys, video from a helicopter flyover showed. About 60 percent of Grand Bahama was under water, the satellite company Iceye said Monday. That includes the airport. All around, massive waves curled toward the island, delivering new blows.\n\n\n\nAlso watch: PM says Bahamians are 'very resilient' (Provided by Reuters)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the power and ferocity of the storm, it\u2019s also the length of time it spent over Abaco and Grand Bahama,\u201d said Marvin Dames, the minister of national security for the Bahamas. \u201cThat\u2019s a disastrous outcome.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeven people have died in Abaco, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at an evening news conference, although the toll was expected to climb. Children were among those killed, Mr. Dames had said earlier.\n\nHurricane Dorian first made landfall in the Bahamas as a category 5 storm on Sunday, but then it lingered, pummeling Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands, blocking even a basic accounting of the number of victims and the destruction.\n\nCindy Russell, a resident of Marsh Harbour whose home was destroyed, said she had no words to describe what Dorian left in its wake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we just need to be rescued and put on another island to start over again,\u201d she said. \u201cComplete devastation.\u201d\n\nThough the hurricane, now a category 2, was pushing its way toward Florida, it was not expected to clear the islands until early Wednesday.\n\n\u201cStorm surge is the number one killer in a tropical storm,\u201d said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, speaking of the rising of the sea that results from the wind and pressure changes brought on by a storm.\n\nAlso watch: Aerial footage from Bahamas storm zone shows widespread destruction (Provided by Reuters)\n\nIn Freeport, the largest city on Grand Bahama, Sarah Kirkby watched helplessly as a huge flood poured in and inundated her house.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never seen water come in like that. You don\u2019t realize the power until you\u2019re in it.\u201d\n\nSome local rescue efforts began on Tuesday, she said, as the water began to recede, with neighbors manning Jet Skis to rescue people trapped on their roofs \u2014 but it was unclear where they might go, since many shelters were also flooded or damaged by the storm.\n\nAid agencies that were staged in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, grew frustrated through the day, waiting on standby to deliver desperately needed supplies. Few helicopters were able to take off for the hardest-hit areas because of high winds, low visibility and limited space.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an overabundance of people to help,\u201d said William M. Holowesko, general manager of Odyssey Aviation in Nassau, which became a de facto staging ground for relief flights Tuesday.\u201d So there is that pent-up frustration on many different fronts.\u201d\n\nAmerican government helicopter crews \u2014 mainly from the United States Coast Guard but also from Customs and Border Protection \u2014 have been conducting evacuation missions.\n\nAll of the rescues on Abaco were conducted by the Coast Guard, which also provided the prime minister and Bahamas emergency management officials with their first flyover to assess the damages. But conditions on Grand Bahama were so poor that even the military helicopters were forced to turn back, so no rescues were attempted there.\n\n\n\nCoast Guard Rear Adm. Todd Sokalzuk said officials still had a \u201clarge volume\u201d of calls for help from people stranded on their rooftops.\n\n\u00a9 Ramon Espinosa/Associated Press Submerged vehicles in Freeport on Grand Bahama on Tuesday.\n\nResponders were trying to take advantage of a window of opportunity after the eye passed over Grand Bahama to try to rescue people, but many police cruisers and other emergency vehicles were under water.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of the bigger vehicles, dump trucks and fire engines, are trying to get through the water,\u201d Kevin D. Harris, director general of the Bahamas Information Service, said. \u201cGrand Bahama is flat, and you can imagine the devastation we are going to incur.\u201d\n\nThere was so much water that government offices, including the government radio station, had to leave the lower floors.\n\nThe islands in the northwestern Bahamas that were hit the hardest \u2014 the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama \u2014 are 30 feet at their highest point, and the storm surge reached up to 23 feet, not counting the waves, said Joel Cline, the Tropical Program Coordinator at NOAA.\n\nPhotographs from flights over Abaco show trees sheared of limbs and leaves and saltwater ponds covering swaths of land where homes once stood. Some houses had their roofs ripped clean off, while others were reduced to piles of debris mired in water. All around, a rough ocean lapped at the low-lying islands.\n\nOn Tuesday, people continued to seek shelter at the Grand Lucayan Resort and Casino on Grand Bahama, said Michael Scott, who is the chairman of the government-owned hotel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophic and dystopian mess,\u201d he said, estimating that more than 400 people were now being cared for at the hotel. \u201cOther shelters which have been compromised are having their people decanted into our facility.\u201d\n\nTo bring more people to safety, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to use big trucks and big vehicles.\u201d\n\nPassenger cars and even emergency service vehicles had been trapped by the floods, according to photos and videos shared by text message from residents on the island.\n\nOn the Abaco Islands, east of Grand Bahama, officials believe whole towns have been wiped out. The area, whose population includes Haitian migrants living in shantytowns like the Mudd and Pigeon Peas, is especially vulnerable. The Mudd was \u201cdecimated,\u201d the prime minister said Tuesday night.\n\nCaribbean disaster response managers say that they may not be able to get any firsthand information out of the islands until Wednesday.\n\nThe Bahamas are no stranger to hurricanes. But Dorian, with sustained wind speeds of 185 miles per hour, ranks as one of the strongest to ever make landfall, tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane.\n\nThe powerful storm\u2019s sluggish pace \u2014 it crawled over the island at about 1 mile per hour from Monday afternoon to Tuesday morning \u2014 ensured steady, brutal destruction, with harrowing images of residents among the ruins of their homes surfacing on social media.\n\nMore than 200 people have placed frantic rescue calls to emergency officials, including a government minister, who was also trapped with his family in his own attic.\n\nIt is not unheard-of for storms to stall. Hurricane Betsy stalled for a day and a half off the coast of Florida in 1965. More recently, Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1998 and Hurricane Wilma lingered off the coast of Cancun in 2005, according to Mr. Feltgen, of the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\u201cStorms stall, they\u2019re steered by the weather pattern that surrounds them, so if that weather pattern is in equilibrium, then the storm will stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an atmospheric tug of war.\u201d\n\nA sense of unity bound those suffering under the weight of the hurricane. Some in the Bahamas who were less affected by the storm took to social media to amplify the calls for help.\n\nCrystal A. deGregory, a historian in Nashville, Tenn., was visiting her family in Freeport when Hurricane Dorian made landfall. She spent all of Monday fielding frantic calls for rescue from her relatives.\n\nHer sister, cornered by rising water, children in tow, cried for help on social media. Ms. deGregory began to post as well, offering addresses and details to rescuers on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI was terrified,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, many residents faced the terrifying choice between staying in their rapidly-flooding homes or plunging into the volatile waters to seek shelter.\n\nTim Aylen, a Grand Bahama resident, waded through chest-deep storm surges with his wife and young son, spurred on by fear and horror. He barely had time to make the decision to flee.\n\n\u201cYou open the door, and the water\u2019s just pouring in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think, \u2018No, that\u2019s going to flood the house.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn that frantic moment, he made the call to leave the house, rather than flee to the attic. With their belongings in bags, his family and their three dogs forded the rushing water.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced a lot of hurricanes in our time, but nothing like this,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Aylen said that once his family was secured in a nearby shelter, he assisted with the search and rescue of people torn from their homes.\n\n\u201cThis little girl, she just jumped into my arms and she was screaming,\u201d he recalled.\n\nSam Teicher, an American who moved to Grand Bahama Island 18 months ago to set up a coral farm saw his project destroyed by the storm. It was meant to restore dying reefs near the island.\n\nOn Tuesday Mr. Teicher saw firsthand the wreckage left by Dorian.\n\n\u201cThe water seemed to stretch for miles,\u201d Mr. Teicher said. \u201cIt was kind of like looking at those scenes of bayous with the trees coming out of the swamp \u2014 except that\u2019s where people live.\u201d\n\nRachel Knowles reported from Nassau, Frances Robles from Miami and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.
