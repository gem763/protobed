They won a Pulitzer Prize \u2014 and within months the infant mortality rate had dropped. As someone married to a pediatrician and committed to investing in solving health challenges, I found this to be a powerful example of how journalism can help us make progress on our biggest issues.\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be the subject of reporting. I did my first interview at 19, and while I\u2019ve gotten a little better at talking to journalists, people tell me I\u2019m still not exactly a natural. Over the past 15 years, I\u2019ve seen how the news has held Facebook accountable when we\u2019ve made mistakes. This can be uncomfortable, but as I often tell Facebook\u2019s employees, this kind of scrutiny is important: Facebook is part of so many people\u2019s lives, and we have a responsibility to engage with good-faith criticism and use it to get better. Newspapers have broken important stories that have changed the way we operate, and ultimately that\u2019s better not only for our company, but also for society.\n\nGreat journalism surfaces stories that wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been uncovered, and it establishes the ground truth that helps us make progress on important issues. It also holds the powerful accountable. A free press is critical to a healthy democracy, and we need to support the journalists and publishers who do this critical work.\n\nBut the internet disrupted the business model for much of the news industry. When ads started moving from print newspapers to websites, the economics of news changed. Some effects have been positive. Internet services gave news outlets ways to reach new audiences, and research suggests people who get their news on social networks are exposed to a wider range of viewpoints. But breaking the link between publishers and their readers has also made it harder for the news industry to adapt financially to these changes.\n\nFor the past several years I\u2019ve met with journalists, editors and publishers to better understand the challenges and opportunities faced by the news business. I know there\u2019s more we can and must do to help.\n\nWe started earlier this year, with a $300 million commitment to help publishers \u2014 especially in local news \u2014 invest in building their readership and subscription models. Local newspapers have been hardest hit by the technological changes, but they can have as much impact on people\u2019s daily lives as the major outlets do. We\u2019re supporting local reporting through the Pulitzer Center and funding journalists who are covering underreported topics in local newsrooms.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to support journalism directly in our apps for a long time. But we\u2019ve faced a dilemma trying to do more in the main News Feed because most of our community consistently tells us that they want to see more updates from their friends, family and communities, and less other content. For most people, social networks are still primarily about being social.\n\nBut over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve started successfully building tabs outside of the main News Feed, like Marketplace for buying and selling items, and Watch for videos. Even if only 10 percent to 20 percent of our community in the United States uses one of these tabs, that\u2019s around 15 million to 30 million people. We\u2019ve been working with publishers on building an experience like this for news, and on Friday we launched the result of that work: Facebook News.\n\nFor the first time, there will be a place in the Facebook app dedicated solely to high-quality news. Because people are still better at picking out the most important and highest-quality stories, the top stories in Facebook News will be curated by a team of diverse and seasoned journalists. Below that, there will be a wider selection of stories that are personalized algorithmically. Each story will have clear branding and provenance from the news outlets that published them. Publishers have told us over the years that this is particularly important.\n\nWe\u2019ve also built tools to help publishers increase their subscribers by driving people from Facebook links to publisher websites. Publishers are able to decide when a reader sees a paywall. They control the relationship with their readers with subscription payments taking place directly on publishers\u2019 websites. We don\u2019t take any cut of the subscription revenue because we want as much of the revenue as possible to go toward funding quality journalism.\n\nThis model establishes a long-term financial partnership between publishers and Facebook for the first time. We know that we need to help build a stable model. Unlike other things we\u2019ve tried in the past, this is a multiyear commitment that should give publishers the confidence to plan ahead. We now have multiyear partnerships with ABC News, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, The Dallas Morning News and many more publishers.\n\nThis also establishes a new product on Facebook for people who want a dedicated high-quality news experience. This will start small, but I\u2019m optimistic that if we listen carefully to the ideas and concerns of news organizations all over the world, we can grow this over time.\n\nSupporting quality news can also help us fight misinformation. That\u2019s why we\u2019re setting strict standards for publishers to be eligible to appear in Facebook News. If a publisher posts misinformation, it will no longer appear in the product.\n\nI believe deeply in the social good that journalism provides. Today, it\u2019s more important than ever: We need the news to scrutinize the powerful, reliably document major events and uncover new truths. This makes our society better, and I know from firsthand experience it has made our company better too \u2014 even when it\u2019s uncomfortable. I hope our efforts will honor the important work that journalists do and support the news industry that keeps us all informed.\n\nThe post Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook Can Help the News Business appeared first on New York Times.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mark-Zuckerberg-Facebook-Can-Help-the-News-Business.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
