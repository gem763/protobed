(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nFour-year-old Arshiya Naoaj was up early Monday, her dad said, excited to get back to the morning routine she\u2019d missed all summer: riding Metro.\n\n\u201cShe woke up early to celebrate,\u201d Shah Naoaj, 32, said, laughing as Arshiya ducked behind his back at the Van Dorn station about 8 a.m. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. We\u2019re glad those dark days are gone.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdark days\u201d to which he refers are those of the summerlong shutdown of six Blue and Yellow line stations south of Reagan Nation Airport. The stations, closed since late May for a massive platform reconstruction project, reopened Monday, on time.\n\nArshiya and her father were among roughly 17,000 commuters whose regular routes \u2014 through either the Braddock Road, King Street-Old Town, Eisenhower Avenue, Huntington, Van Dorn or Franconia-Springfield stations \u2014 were disrupted or derailed for much of the summer.\n\nFor the Naoajes, that meant their morning commute from Alexandria to downtown Washington \u2014 he to his job as an economist, she to child care \u2014 ballooned from a 40-minute ride to a two-hour slog that required multiple bus switches and, on especially dark days, an expensive Uber.\n\nAs he paced around the Braddock Road station early Monday, greeting riders and surveying the scene, Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld acknowledged the frustration but said the work was necessary to keep the system safe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long summer for our customers . . . no doubt about it,\u201d Wiedefeld said. \u201cWe had to do it. It was a safety issue: If we didn\u2019t do it this way, we would wake up one day and have to shut it down.\u201d\n\n[Despite warnings and planning, Metro shutdown leads to commute meltdown for many]\n\n\n\nThe King Street station is one of six stops that reopened Monday. (Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nThe $200 million project, Wiedefeld said, represents a new era of accountability in which, \u201cwhen we get a safety issue, we get on top of it.\u201d\n\nThis shutdown was the first step in Metro\u2019s plan to rebuild 20 station platforms by the end of 2021.\n\nMetro board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg marveled at the new LED lights illuminating the station. Other smaller-scale fixes included nicer platform and bus shelters, larger screens to display train schedules, an improved audio system for station announcements and USB ports in every shelter.\n\n\u201cI think the first thing I noticed was the lighting, the feel of it,\u201d Smedberg said. \u201cI think the stations look great.\u201d\n\nSmedberg was one of several top officials Metro deployed to greet returning riders Monday. Metro Treasurer Craig Gross spent the morning roaming the Braddock Road platform, a shiny blue \u201cHello Again\u201d badge affixed to his suit, as he answered commuters\u2019 questions and distributed complementary Metro tote bags.\n\nMary Chris Chapman, 65, who has commuted to work via Metro for about 13 years, said the station \u201csmells like a new car\u201d and looks like one, too \u2014 \u201cclean and beautiful.\u201d\n\nRider Chris McLennon, 49, called the station\u2019s \u201cchanged ambiance . . . futuristic.\u201d\n\nOthers focused on the floor. Light rain began to fall about 9 a.m., prompting travelers at the Braddock Road and Van Dorn stations to test out the new, slip-resistant platform tiles. Larger and more porous than their predecessors \u2014 though colored the same shade of rust red \u2014 the tiles are supposed to provide better drainage, minimizing the chance of puddles.\n\n[As shutdown looms on Blue and Yellow lines, Metro confronts \u2018Braddock hump\u2019]\n\n\n\nMetro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld takes a train from Braddock Road station to King Street station. (Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great they replaced these because everyone slipped on them,\u201d said Celeste Carter, 66, an employee of the National Science Foundation who has ridden Metro to work for more than a decade.\n\nMostly, though, riders rejoiced in the sudden truncation of their commutes. As they stuffed their belongings into Metro tote bags or munched on free doughnut holes provided by a former Alexandria City Council member, commuter after commuter detailed shutdown horror stories.\n\nAlexandria resident Brianna Watkins, 28, said the closures added an extra two hours to her travels. Watkins, who works in security in downtown Washington, had just given birth to her second child when the shutdown began.\n\n\u201cJust getting back to work after having him was a lot, and then this,\u201d Watkins said as she waited on the Van Dorn platform with Kimora, 5, and Shiloh, 5 months. \u201cIt was at exactly the wrong time for me.\u201d\n\nSome riders documented their excitement on social media. One man filmed the arrival of an approaching train via Snapchat for his friends, real-time proof that the stations were up and running. Another woman traversed the Braddock Road station end-to-end to curate a celebratory collage of photos \u2014 including at least one selfie with a platform sign \u2014 before sending it to her fiance.\n\n[Blind riders say Metro shutdown is making independent travel nearly impossible]\n\n\n\nCommuters board trains at Braddock Road station. (Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nAlexandria resident Howard Scott, on the other hand, was a little disappointed in having to give up the \u201cpretty nice setup\u201d he had during the shutdown. The 56-year-old federal employee was allowed to work from home for the duration of the closures.\n\nThough he missed his colleagues, he\u2019d grown used to the casual, comfortable environment.\n\n\u201cI was able to dress kinda scruffy,\u201d Scott said as he stood on the Braddock Road platform, eyeing his dress shoes and slacks.\n\nWiedefeld said riders\u2019 reaction to the reopening was almost uniformly positive. He is not anticipating a post-shutdown dip in ridership; \u201cpeople will come back because we\u2019re reliable,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, the few complaints he has received are nearly all about the same thing. The contractor used the wrong font in signage at at least two of the rebuilt stations: Helvetica Black, instead of Helvetica Bold.\n\nMetro plans to fix the typeface, Wiedefeld said, though he is unsure when that will happen.\n\n\u201cI saw a conspiracy theory that this was the first step in changing all the fonts,\u201d Wiedefeld said, laughing. \u201cC\u2019mon people, we\u2019re not that sophisticated!\u201d", "description": "Six Blue and Yellow line stations reopened Monday after a mammoth platform reconstruction project.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
