The fight didn\u2019t go according to plan, and afterward he promised to be back better than ever. White, however, didn\u2019t seem as enthusiastic about that notion.\n\n\u201cWhat he said tonight didn\u2019t sound to me like he is considering retirement,\u201d White told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at the post-event news conference. \u201cSo it\u2019s a conversation he and I definitely need to have. This was his move up to light heavyweight, which obviously didn\u2019t go well for him. So maybe he goes back down to middleweight or he thinks about maybe retiring.\u201d\n\nWeidman, 35, began his career on a 13-0 run that included a pair of championship-fight victories over Anderson Silva. His move up to 205 pounds was encouraged by a chance to dethrone another all-time great in Jon Jones, but those plans experienced a major setback.\n\nIncluding the fight in which he lost UFC gold, Weidman has suffered five knockout losses in less than four years.", "description": "Chris Weidman lost by knockout for the fifth time in less than four years at UFC Boston.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Blue Corner", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chris-weidman-ufc-boston.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
