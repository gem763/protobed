His punishment: Forfeiting one vacation day.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cPush him off the roof,\u201d Kissimmee Police Sgt. Anthony Amada called from the yard. \u201cPush him off. Just push him off.\u201d\n\nBody-camera video released Wednesday by the Kissimmee Police Department shows that Torres, who had been accused of absconding with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s car, offered to climb back into the house through an open window. But officer Plenio Massiah, who had followed the suspect onto the roof, obeyed his supervisor\u2019s orders. Planting one hand on Torres\u2019 upper back, he gave the teenager a firm shove and sent him flying. The 18-year-old hit the ground with a thud, and Amada rushed over and stunned him with a Taser.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not resisting, bro,\u201d Torres pleaded, as police cuffed him.\n\nThough Torres wasn\u2019t hurt by the fall, the March 3 standoff \u201ccould have resulted in significant injury,\u201d the Kissimmee Police Department acknowledged in an internal investigation released to local media outlets on Wednesday. The 41-page report, which followed a seven-month investigation, concluded that pushing a suspect off a roof went against departmental policies governing the use of force, and was generally a bad idea.\n\nBut for the two officers involved, the consequences have been minimal. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Massiah was given an eight-hour suspension, which he fulfilled by giving up a vacation day. Amada, who the investigators recommended be fired, had already handed in his notice in June. At the time of his resignation, the 14-year veteran was facing another, unrelated complaint alleging excessive use of force, and had recently been suspended for another incident where he was deemed to have acted carelessly during a police pursuit, the paper reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe March confrontation on the rooftop came after Torres\u2019 ex-girlfriend called police to report that he had been driving her car without her permission for a week. According to charging documents, the two had argued about whether she would give him a ride home on Feb. 24, and the dispute grew so heated that the woman got out of the car and walked home, leaving Torres in a post office parking lot with her silver Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe next morning, she told police, she contacted Torres on Facebook and asked for the car back. He refused.\n\nA week later, when she still didn\u2019t have her Toyota back, Torres\u2019 ex-girlfriend contacted the police, saying that a friend of hers had spotted the car parked in a Kissimmee subdivision. Sure enough, when officers showed up at the beige stucco house on March 3, they spotted Torres inside. The 18-year-old made a beeline up the stairs, police wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThinking he might escape through a window, they ran to the other side of the house, only to discover that the teen was on the roof. In his affidavit, officer Patrick Smith wrote that Torres looked ready to jump, but seemed to change his mind when he saw police waiting for him on the ground.\n\n\u201cSgt. Amada and I as well as Officer Massiah pleaded with Yadiel to surrender several times but he refused so Officer Massiah nudged him off the roof because he was not complying with a law order to stop resisting,\u201d Smith wrote. He added that after hitting the ground, Torres \u201cappeared as if he was going to get up,\u201d so Amada deployed his Taser.\n\nCourt records show that Torres was arrested for third-degree grand theft of a motor vehicle, resisting an officer without violence and violating the terms of his pretrial release for a misdemeanor domestic violence charge from January. He pleaded guilty to all three offenses in May and was sentenced to a year and a half of supervised probation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe body-camera video released on Wednesday shows that the officers\u2019 attempts to get Torres to surrender consisted of repeatedly encouraging him to jump off the roof. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get Tased and you\u2019re going to fall, so you better jump,\u201d the 18-year-old was told. According to the Sentinel, Torres told internal affairs investigators that he ignored the command because he was afraid of getting hurt.\n\nIn their report, officials noted that Massiah was only following orders when he pushed the teenager off the roof, WFTV reported. The officer, who had no prior disciplinary violations, told investigators he feared that both he and Torres would fall off the roof if they started tussling. Police also reportedly said that Torres\u2019 ex-girlfriend had warned authorities that he might be armed, a detail that did not appear in the initial charging documents from the incident.\n\nThe potential consequences for Amada were more severe because investigators felt that he should know better after 14 years on the force.\n\n\u201cPersonnel who have reached a supervisory position are held to even greater standards than officers or civilian personnel because their guidance, influence and knowledge contribute to the overall success of the department,\u201d officials wrote in a memo obtained by the Sentinel.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not resisting, bro,\u201d Yadiel Torres pleaded, as police stunned him with a Taser and cuffed him.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/efBuYIk4ST8NK87ur9-ep8VLES0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VG4Z6JMFEVDD5CVZBB2I2UEA7U.PNG", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
