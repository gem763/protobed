It is [Chinese] down there,\u201d he continues, this time in a mocking accent. \u201cLet the fucking chinks live there.\u201d\n\nIn a second clip shared by Simons, Gillis says that \u201can Asian trying to learn English\u201d bothers him more than \u201cany other minority playing music in a restaurant loud on their phone.\u201d\n\nHe then describes his racist jokes as \u201cnice racism, good racism.\u201d\n\nThe original video is no longer on YouTube, though a copy of it exists on Simons\u2019 Twitter account.

I\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cMy intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with a response from Gillis.", "description": "Shane Gillis' offensive jokes surfaced as people celebrated Bowen Yang, the third Asian person to make it to \"SNL's\" full cast in its 45-season history.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7af009230000e903524bb0.png?cache=v4t3mlztez&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
