Our quartet of journalists from the EU's key capitals debate those concerns and asks what the kerfuffle tells us about how President-elect Ursula von der Leyen operates.\n\nAnd just when you thought Italian politics had calmed down... Former PM Matteo Renzi and his allies have broken away from the governing Democratic Party. Our correspondent in Rome, Silvia Sciorilli-Borrelli, tells us what it means for Italy and Europe.\n\nOur special guest is Georgian President Salom\u00e9 Zourabichvili, who\u2019s trying to bring her country closer to the EU even as she accepts it won't be joining the bloc \u2014 at least not for a long time to come. At the same time, she has to manage a standoff with Russia, which occupies 20 percent of Georgia's territory. POLITICO\u2019s Rym Momtaz caught up with Zourabichvili during a visit to Paris.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EU-Confidential-homepage-v1-red.png"}
