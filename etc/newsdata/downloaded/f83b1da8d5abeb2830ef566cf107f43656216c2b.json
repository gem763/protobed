Security systems can be expensive, but luckily one of the best security systems you can buy is currently discounted at Best Buy.\n\nThe Arlo Pro 2 security kit, which comes with two cameras and a smart doorbell, is on sale for $299.99 \u2014 that's $150 off the normal price of $449.99.\n\nThere's plenty to love about the Arlo Pro 2 security system. The cameras are pretty high quality with a 1,080p resolution and night vision, so you can clearly see what's going on in your home day or night. The two cameras are weatherproof, so they can be mounted indoors or outdoors.\n\nThe smart doorbell is pretty impressive too. While it doesn't have a camera built into it, it does support two-way audio, allowing you to talk to whoever is at the door from the Arlo app, no matter where you are \u2014 as long as you have an internet connection. Whenever someone presses the button on the doorbell, you'll get a notification, so you can still answer the door when you're not at home.\n\nFrom the app, you can watch footage from your cameras and manage your security system's settings. All in all, the kit is a good place to start for smart home enthusiasts who want to have a basic security system in place.\n\nAs mentioned above, the deal ends today, October 10, 2019, so if you are interested, you'll want to act quickly.", "description": "For a limited time, a kit with two Arlo Pro security cameras and a smart doorbell is on sale for $150 off the normal price from Best Buy.", "authors": ["Christian De Looper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f684c3b33a7615b187b83?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
