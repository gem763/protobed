These moves were announced by editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\n\u201cOur journalism is stronger than ever in good measure because of the work of our corps of senior editors, led so expertly by Adrienne LaFrance,\u201d Goldberg wrote in a memo to staff on Tuesday.\n\nRoss Andersen will become a deputy editor for The Atlantic, with a focus on conceptualizing and editing some of The Atlantic\u2019s most ambitious reporting. Together with print editor Don Peck and deputy editor Denise Wills, as well as LaFrance and managing editor Swati Sharma, he will help the print magazine produce rigorous coverage of the sciences, and will work across the newsroom to sharpen features on a range of subjects. Andersen will also continue to write; in the past few years, he reported from Siberia on a radical scheme to address climate change by bringing back woolly mammoths, and from India for an expansive look at the science of animal consciousness. Andersen has overseen The Atlantic\u2019s Science, Technology, and Health sections since 2015, growing all three desks and helping to open The Atlantic\u2019s San Francisco bureau in 2018. With Andersen\u2019s shift to deputy, the Technology section will be led by editor Ellen Cushing, Science by Sarah Laskow, and Health by Paul Bisceglio.", "description": "Ross Andersen named deputy editor; Caitlin Frazier promoted to senior audience editor; and Yoni Appelbaum to lead major expansion of Ideas section.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RossCaitYoniComposite/facebook.jpg?1565749762"}
