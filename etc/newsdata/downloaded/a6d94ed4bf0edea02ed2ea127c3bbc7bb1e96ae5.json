(Photo by Kristoffer Tripplaar/For The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump finally chose a new Republican commissioner for a key panel of federal energy regulators. But he did so without naming a Democrat to go with him, setting off a potential battle with Senate Democrats over the future of renewable energy and gas pipeline projects across the country.\n\nOn Monday, the White House announced the president intends to nominate James Danly to be a commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Danly, a Republican, currently serves as the panel\u2019s general counsel and would fill a vacancy left by the death in January of former FERC chairman Kevin J. McIntyre. If confirmed by the Senate, Danly would serve until 2023.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s White House broke with decades-old tradition by not nominating a Democrat along with Danly, provoking the ire of Senate Democrats who charge Trump with potentially tilting the balance of the normally bipartisan commission.\n\n\u201cThe administration should not play politics with our national energy policy and instead follow tradition by formally nominating both a Republican and a Democrat as a pair to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe five-member energy panel has a sweeping portfolio, regulating portions of the electricity grid, interstate oil transportation and natural gas pipelines. If Danly is confirmed without a Democrat, the panel would move forward on a number of key decisions in the coming months with three Republicans and only one Democrat.\n\nFERC has two openings \u2014 one to be filled by a Republican, the other by a Democrat. Congress designed FERC to have no more than three members from the president\u2019s own party.\n\n\u201cHaving a full commission is more likely to get you towards nonpartisanship and independence, both of which have been hallmarks of FERC in the past. It's not just lip service,\u201d said John Moore, who focuses on electric grid issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThat gives industry, and everyone else, a lot more faith in power markets.\u201d\n\nThe commission showed that independence when in early 2018 the Trump-appointed regulators unanimously rejected a plan from Energy Secretary Rick Perry to rescue struggling coal and nuclear plants.\n\nThe recent foot-dragging from the White House, which did not reply to a request for comment, was not for lack of effort on the part of Senate Democrats.\n\nEarlier this year, Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, recommended that energy lawyer Allison Clements replace a Democratic commissioner, Cheryl LaFleur, who stepped down at the end of August.\n\nThe Senate under both Barack Obama in 2012 and George W. Bush in 2006 treated Republican and Democratic FERC nominations as a package. Trump did so once in 2017 when he sent the nominations of McIntyre, a Republican and Richard Glick, a Democrat, to the Senate simultaneously.\n\nAll FERC commissioners are required to be confirmed by the Senate. The White House could ultimately send Danly's and Clements's nominations to the chamber as a package.\n\n\u201cPutting up only one nominee in this situation is unique,\u201d said Jeff Dennis, who worked at FERC for 11 years before becoming managing director and general counsel at Advanced Energy Economy, a clean-energy trade association. \u201cIt would tip the balance more severely at the commission than it is right now.\u201d\n\nNear the top of FERC\u2019s chock-full agenda is a potential new rule to make government-supported renewable energy generation more expensive for 65 million people who get power from PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission system that covers all or parts of 13 states stretching from Illinois to New Jersey, as well as the District of Columbia.\n\nTen Senate Democrats, worried the new regulations from the GOP-controlled panel could undermine Democratic state policies designed to support clean energy, oppose the yet-to-be-finalized rule, calling it \u201cfederal overreach\u201d in an Aug. 29 letter to FERC \u200bChairman Neil Chatterjee.\n\nChatterjee, who joined FERC last year after working as an energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is also eager to accelerate approvals of natural gas pipelines and export facilities.\n\nBut Glick, the lone remaining Democrat on the panel, has argued FERC has done a \u201cpoor job\u201d taking into account the climate impacts of building more gas pipeline. Chatterjee has said considering how more natural gas infrastructure could speed up climate change is outside the purview of the commission.\n\nSo far, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the chairwoman of the Senate energy panel, through Danly's nomination must pass, isn't saying whether she would move forward with just the Republican nomination.\n\n\u201cI welcome the President\u2019s decision to nominate a Republican commissioner and to fill a critical seat that has now been vacant for nine full months,\u201d Murkowski said in a statement. \u201cWe will need to receive both a formal nomination and all associated paperwork before proceeding to a hearing, which has not been scheduled at this time.\u201d\n\nThe Energy 202 will be publishing on a limited schedule while Congress is on recess this week and next week. We will not be publishing Oct. 4, 7 or 11. We will return to our normal schedule on Oct. 14.\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

The deal is set to allow the Environmental Protection Agency to offset waivers exempting oil refineries from biofuel mandates by \u201cadjusting the targets to reflect a three-year rolling average of exemptions,\u201d Bloomberg News reports. But it all \"could still unravel as administration officials work to translate broad commitments into formal regulations. There is a narrow window for the Trump administration to codify the changes, as the EPA is legally required to finalize 2020 biofuel-blending quotas by Nov. 30.\u201d\n\nArch Canyon within Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.

That cap would decline over time, mirroring a similar compact that has reduced power plant emissions in the Northeast,\u201d the Boston Globe reports. \u201cThe current proposal does not include crucial, potentially controversial details, such as how much pollution would be allowed, how much the permits would cost, and how quickly the caps would decline. That information is slated to be released later this year.\u201d\n\nAn electric power pole leans over the road in the Piedra Blanca area of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.
