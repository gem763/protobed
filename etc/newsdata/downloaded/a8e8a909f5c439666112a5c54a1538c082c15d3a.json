I have been voting [for] this movement since 1994 and had never missed even one of the national or provincial votes since democracy.\n\n\u201cI would even make sure that both my beloved parents, who are late now, get special votes at home and that they vote for the ANC. Furthermore, I would in the whole family including my siblings convince them why we should and are voting for the ANC.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still not sure whether I [will] continue to vote for this beloved movement or not Themba Magagula\n\nAt the time it was about two months before the May general elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure whether I [will] continue to vote for this beloved movement or not. I haven\u2019t even started canvassing to my siblings as yet. I\u2019m viewing voting the ANC as keeping the status quo. I love, trust and have confidence in our current President [Cyril] Ramaphosa.\u201d\n\nNext was his plea for Ramaphosa \u201cto take urgent action on Correctional Services matters that were raised by Angelo Agrizzi\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are no lies in what Agrizzi has revealed in the Zondo commission. Taking action on this will bring back the confidence and trust that we have in you Mr President, otherwise we will start to view you as a dog that barks but has no teeth to bite.\u201d\n\nHe then wished Ramaphosa strength, adding: \u201cI love the ANC and I can\u2019t afford betraying it for the enemy.\u201d\n\nThe department saw Magagula\u2019s post and, subsequent to a legal opinion from the state attorney, Fraser put three charges of misconduct before him, including \u201cbringing the department into disrepute; gross prejudice to the administration, discipline or efficiency of the department; and displaying a conflict of interest\u201d.\n\nFraser accused Magagula of contravening the social media policy and SMS handbook, including posting \u201ccommunication which may be interpreted as an official position and failing to try to resolve any complaint internally but resorting to public comment and criticism\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou conducted yourself in a manner that lacked high ethical standards expected from a senior official by confirming as correct statements or allegations made at the Zondo commission,\u201d read the charge sheet.\n\nFor his ANC comments Magagula was charged with abusing his position \u201cto promote the interest of a political party\u201d and that he \u201cengaged in, or took part in a political activity when on duty or in official premises\u201d.\n\nIn August Magagula pleaded his case and argued inconsistency, showing in documents that Nesangani had made several comments on Bosasa and politics in general for the period of a year between January 2017 and last year.\n\nThe argument led to a postponement of proceedings on September 2 and confirmation by the state attorney on September 10 that Magagula had a valid argument.\n\nAccording to documents, Nesangani\u2019s comments included criticism of the \u201cbig belly\u201d ANC youth league leader; Malusi Gigaba and Jacob Zuma\u2019s alleged lies; Tito Mboweni\u2019s alleged disconnection with reality over the e-tolls; Ace Magashule being a \u201cfactory fault\u201d, Nomvula Mokonyane\u2019s alleged wrongful appointments; as well as declaring his distrust for Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.\n\nI wonder what [the] reaction will be when I meet my colleagues who are implicated in the corruption state capture Themba Magagula\n\nOn Bosasa he said: \u201cI wonder what [the] reaction will be when I meet my colleagues who are implicated in the corruption state capture [sic]. I use [sic] to think I am failing to save money to do everything I wanted when I see people doing extra good things. Now, eh, eh, eh, I changed my thought.\u201d\n\nAmong his duties, the charged director of corporate services, advises Gauteng regional commissioner Grace Molatedi on human resource policies.\n\nMolatedi, a former deputy regional commissioner of the Free State, was mentioned by Agrizzi in the state capture commission inquiry on allegations that she received R150 000 from Bosasa.\n\nTwo of the senior officials serving in the steering committee that decided to invesigate Magagula \u2013 Maria Mabena and Jafta Mkhabela \u2013 were also mentioned by Agrizzi as being among those who received kickbacks from Bosasa.\n\nThe department declined to comment.\n\nTALK TO US Does your company have regulations about what you\u2019re allowed to post on social media?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword SOCIAL and tell us what you think.
