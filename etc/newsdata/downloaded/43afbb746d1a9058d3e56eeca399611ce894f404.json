REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi\n\nFrom job losses to canceled honeymoons, the demise of the package tour pioneer has brought a heavy human cost and left an estimated 600,000 people stranded worldwide.\n\nTravelers scoured mobile phones or quizzed officials for travel updates as they waited in long queues beneath flight boards showing flights delayed or canceled.\n\n\u201cFrom Thomas Cook we didn\u2019t get anything. I feel sorry for the reps because I don\u2019t think they knew anything either. It was the hotel which kept us up to date,\u201d said Ricky Houston, who said his flight to the northern English city of Newcastle from the Greek island of Corfu had been delayed by nine hours.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the hotel here is shocked, and everyone in this hotel has come with Thomas Cook... (But) for us, it\u2019s an inconvenience, for them (the reps) it\u2019s their livelihoods,\u201d added Houston, who is from Dunfermline in Scotland.\n\nDavid Midson, from Kent in southeast England, was trying to find information at the front desk of his hotel in Roda, Corfu.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sign saying that Thomas Cook customers should get in touch with their agency, but you don\u2019t get through to anybody because it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wish I had brought a driving license, because I can\u2019t get a taxi (to the airport).\u201d\n\nThe British government has pledged to get an estimated 150,000 stranded British holidaymakers home in the biggest such repatriation operation since World War Two, but that is no consolation for many others whose holiday plans lie in ruins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely gutted, we\u2019ve looked forward to this for a long time, had the wedding in July so it\u2019s been another couple of months waiting for this,\u201d said Simon, who had been due to go on honeymoon with his wife Polly from London\u2019s Gatwick Airport.\n\nHe said he felt very sorry for the staff at his local Thomas Cook travel agency who he said had been helpful.\n\n\u201cMust be awful for them as well, coming up to Christmas as well... I wish the government had maybe stepped in... It could have been done I think, but there\u2019s nothing we can do now. Just have to go home and make the most of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNIGHTMARE, NIGHTMARE\u201d\n\nSteve Tarrant, who had planned to fly to the Mexican resort of Cancun from Manchester, said he had given up trying to get information about rescheduled flights.\n\n\u201cSo we just took it upon ourselves to book another flight,\u201d he said, at an extra cost of 1,200 pounds ($1,490).\n\nIn Palma airport on the Spanish island of Mallorca, the mood was similarly grim.\n\n\u201cNightmare, nightmare, stressed,\u201d said British holidaymaker Nick, who had two young children - an 18-month-old and 12-year-old - in tow.\n\n\u201cNot what we wanted really before going home. But what can you do? Other people have lost their jobs, so we\u2019re not as bad (off) as some other people.\u201d\n\nScottish tourists hoping to fly back to Glasgow from Mallorca said they now expected to head to the central English city of Birmingham, 400 km (250 miles) away, and then perhaps to be ferried home by coach.\n\nHolidaymakers stranded at Mugla Dalaman Airport in southern Turkey echoed the frustrations with Thomas Cook.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely spoilt my holiday,\u201d said Daren Barden, a 21-year-old contractor from Kent.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t see it coming. Because the only way you could have seen it coming is if Thomas Cook themselves had warned us... We\u2019re getting the plane back to Manchester, which is like six hours from Gatwick, where we should have been (going),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s awful, just disgraceful, really.\u201d", "description": "Holidaymakers hit by the collapse of Thomas Cook , the world's oldest tourist firm, desperately scrambled for information on Monday on how to get home, as Britain mounted its largest repatriation effort since World War Two.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433015634&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M177", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
