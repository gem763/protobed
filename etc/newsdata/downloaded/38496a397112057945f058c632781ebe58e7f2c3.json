Drilling is expected to begin in 2021 and take four years in total.\n\nA mobile 500-tonne base will take equipment to the work site, 1,200km inland from Antarctica\u2019s coast.\n\n\u201cWe are sending men and women into the most remote extreme environment on earth,\u201d AAD director, Kim Ellis, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really challenging adventure.\u201d", "description": "Researchers hope to use bubbles trapped in ice to help predict effect of CO2 on the Earth\u2019s climate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a9c871cca9fb7f3b44704d40c769015c4bb04be/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=074bbdbd92ae15162d8ba00e952a6960", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
