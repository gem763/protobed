Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nIt appears Donald Trump\u2019s defiant impropriety in trying to get a foreign government to investigate a 2020 rival\u2019s son, and then cover up the evidence supplied by a whistleblower, is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for House Democrats. Satisfied, it appears, that many vulnerable House Democrats she had been trying to protect are now in favor of moving ahead with impeachment proceedings against the president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made that position official in a press conference after a late-afternoon meeting with her caucus, as the CBS News reports:\n\nThe speaker has long resisted calls from many progressive lawmakers to initiate impeachment proceedings against the president, but Democrats appear to have reached a breaking point over the administration\u2019s refusal to hand over a whistleblower complaint related to Mr. Trump\u2019s interaction with a foreign leader.\n\n\u201cI can say with authority the Trump administration\u2019s actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and the protections of the whistleblowers,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nPelosi will be charged with a flip-flop here, but in fact, she has always held the door open for impeachment proceedings if further evidence of presidential misconduct emerged, which, given Trump\u2019s pattern of behavior, was always a pretty likely proposition. Yes, we are moving toward the end of the window for impeachment given the proximity of the 2020 elections, but not beyond it. And it seems she is convinced the blatant violation of a whistleblower system designed to protect intelligence-gathering and national security is the right \u201cfresh evidence\u201d to justify her switch. If true, it\u2019s certainly a \u201ccrime\u201d that fits without the definition of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d justifying impeachment proceedings, if not removal from office.\n\nWhat Pelosi\u2019s announcement will accomplish most immediately is an end to the confusion created by House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler\u2019s perhaps-too-clever-by-half maneuver in claiming that \u201cimpeachment proceedings\u201d had already begun, making moot the need for any potentially divisive House vote to authorize them. Now, the House can follow past precedent of the three viable presidential impeachment inquiries (involving Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon \u2014 who resigned before he could be impeached \u2014 and Bill Clinton), setting up via a House vote a road map and timetable for impeachment hearings and an explanation of how Democrats plan to deal with the inevitable Trump administration refusal to cooperate.\n\nPelosi\u2019s new position almost certainly indicates that she thinks she will ultimately have the votes to actually pass articles of impeachment \u2014 she very likely would not put swing-district members through the stress of impeachment hearings if she thought they would not bear fruit. Nothing that has happened so far, on the other hand, has significantly improved the incredibly low odds that Trump could actually be removed from office by the Senate, where Mitch McConnell has made it clear he plans a pro forma trial quickly leading to acquittal if the House does impeach POTUS.\n\nBut now it seems you can add the drama of impeachment hearings to the already-intense atmosphere surrounding the high-stakes presidential election of 2020, which will likely either vindicate Democrats for holding Trump accountable or reward Trump himself for provoking an impeachment fight to rouse his perpetually infuriated base.\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect what Speaker Pelosi said in her press conference.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
