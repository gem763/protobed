Israel already has de facto control of the territory in question. And the Palestinian cause no longer stirs passions across the region as it once did.\n\n\u201cYes they care,\u201d the Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said of Arabs in other countries. \u201cBut will they move their troops? No. Are they going to withdraw their money from American banks? No.\u201d\n\n[If re-elected, Netanyahu says he will annex nearly a third of the occupied West Bank.]\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s vow comes after strategic shifts in the Middle East have pushed the Palestinian cause down the priority list of many Arab leaders and their peoples. It also follows President Trump\u2019s endorsement of a number of unilateral steps by Israel toward other disputed territories.", "description": "Strategic shifts in the Middle East have pushed the Palestinian cause down the priority list of many Arab leaders.", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/world/10arab-reax/10arab-reax-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
