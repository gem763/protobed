Nine electric vehicles were taken on lease for the same from Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) for five years. One of them was spotted being used by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday.\n\nThis came to light when the deputy CM arrived at the launch of state government's 'Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali' campaign. The campaign aims to boost green cover in the state, while also taking care of the depleting water level. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar launched around 35,000 schemes under the new campaign with a total budget of close to Rs 1600 crore.\n\nNitish Kumar himself was spotted using an electric car - Tata Tigor EV back in July, as he arrived for the monsoon session of the Bihar state assembly. When asked about his experience in the eco-friendly car, he had said \"It is a pleasure travelling in this car. It is almost soundless and its design feels very comfortable while sitting inside\".\n\n\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0942\u0937\u0923 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u092e \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0907\u0932\u0947\u0915\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093e\u0935\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0909\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u091c \u0907\u0932\u0947\u0915\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f\u0964 pic.twitter.com/SFGIIi2kAQ \u2014 Sushil Kumar Modi (@SushilModi) October 26, 2019\n\nAs for Modi, who is also the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister, a recent press release by his office mentioned that the minister will only be using the Tata Tigor EV from now on, specifically for his commute \u201cwithin the city\u201d.\n\nDon't Miss 491 SHARES 512 SHARES 153 SHARES 5.2 K SHARES\n\nTata Tigor EV has been empowering official commute in India for long now. Though it was just recently launched for the general public at a starting price of Rs 9.44 lakh. It stands as the only electric vehicle apart from the Mahindra eVerito and the recently inducted Hyundai Kona to serve the Indian government officials till now. The adoption of such electric cars increased after the Finance Ministry directed all government bodies to prefer electric vehicles over IC engine ones for official use.\n\nIn addition to the CM and the deputy CM, the electric cars will also be used by the state Assembly speaker, Legislative Council chairman as well as the chief secretary. The idea is to promote the notion of using an electric vehicle for cutting down on the use of petrol and diesel, thus saving the environment in the process.", "description": "Bihar Deputy CM was recently spotted using an electric car for his commute.
