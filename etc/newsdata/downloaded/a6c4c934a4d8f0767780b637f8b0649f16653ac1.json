She\u2019s gone now so watching her final days, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m watching myself, I feel like I\u2019m watching her. It\u2019s really sad. I feel like someone has died.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOn her Instagram page, Katie said: \u201cIf anything, Sinead\u2019s storyline has taught me to appreciate the small things in life. When she puts her hand out the window to feel the rain for the last time, it really made me appreciate everyday things that we all take for granted.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate everyone sharing their own personal stories with me, my heart goes out to each and every one of you. We only get one life so make sure you live it.\u201d\n\nShe also gave her \u201cheartfelt love and gratitude\u201d to fans for their support during her \u201cseven wonderful years on the cobbles\u201d. Sinead was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year while pregnant with her son Bertie but delayed treatment until after the birth.\n\nLast month she and husband Daniel received the devastating news nothing more could be done for her.\n\nThe illness took hold of her this week before she had time to go to a hospice as planned. Katie, 26, admitted the scenes had made her think about her own life.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tap into them emotions in order to get yourself there. I just feel like it was real from start to finish so when you go home you can\u2019t switch off. For my life personally how it\u2019s changed, I don\u2019t want to be cheesy but I don\u2019t take life for granted as much as I did, I\u2019ve been a bit more emotional with my friends and family.\n\n\u201cLife is not a fairy tale, sometimes soaps and TV tends to do the happy ending and I thought if we\u2019re doing the story we need to do it properly to raise awareness. I hope people who\u2019ve been through similar find it cathartic.\u201d\n\nCorrie bosses worked closely with charities Mummy\u2019s Star and Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust on the storyline and have been praised for raising awareness of the issue. Most of this week\u2019s episodes were filmed over two weeks in a set of Sinead\u2019s bedroom built specially for them.\n\nKatie and Rob Mallard, who plays her husband Daniel, found it easy to feel emotional once the cameras were rolling on the new set.\n\nRob said: \u201cWe had such an emotional attachment in that room, when you were in there you were immediately back where you left it before. It wasn\u2019t difficult to get into, if anything it was difficult to not just cry, it felt very real. \u201d\n\nKatie added: \u201cWe felt like somebody had actually died.\u201d Following Sinead\u2019s death, Rob\u2019s character Daniel faces difficult decisions - he shared a kiss with Bethany Platt days before his young wife\u2019s death.\n\nHe argued with Sinead about the relationship but she forgave him. A confused Bethany is keen for their friendship to continue.\n\nRob said: \u201cHe has Bertie to focus on, Sinead has told him all these things, forgive himself and all of that, but it\u2019s all caught up in the death.\n\n\u201cHe now has to unpick all of that, the meaning and the message of what she said and actually apply it. But with the trauma and shock, you get away from that as quickly as possible. There will be changes in Daniel.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have to untangle all of those emotions. Because him and Bethany share a guilt, and there\u2019s a Sinead attachment to that, he doesn\u2019t know what he wants from her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether he needs to forgive her, or whether he wants her to forgive him, or if he wants to say that Sinead forgave both of them.\u201d", "description": "The soap star says seeing herself acting her Coronation Street character Sinead's heartbreaking cervical cancer plot-line felt like watching a real person die", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725549.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196861589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
