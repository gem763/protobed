People quietly fumed. A week later, high-school students launched four days of turnstile-jumping protests. Crowds of angry youths built up inside metro stations.\n\nWith no warning, on the afternoon of Oct. 18, they set fire to stations, then trains. Then grocery, department stores and pharmacies went up in flames. Hundreds of thousands of people were left stranded at home or on the streets without public transport. But instead of blaming the young protesters, Chileans from almost all walks of life used social media to call for protests against years of government mismanagement.\n\nSantiago exploded into a week of massive street protests that culminated Friday with more than a million people in the heart of the capital and other major cities \u2014 the largest demonstrations ever in the country, according to multiple historians.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

There, Chileans said the rise in the cost of a metro ticket had been merely the spark that set off years of frustration with the dark underbelly of their country\u2019s long drive to be the most market-driven economy in Latin America.\n\n\u201cWhat we Chileans want is equal treatment for all, that the cake be divided up fairly,\u201d said Mario Gonzalez, 34, who runs a t-shirt printing business. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything for free; we just want to pay a fair price.\u201d\n\nYoung, old, poor and middle-class, protesters said they were united by frustration with the so-called neoliberal model that has left Chile with region-topping prosperity along with a widely criticized private pension system, and two-tiered health and education systems that blend the public and private, with better results for the minority who can afford to pay, protesters said.\n\nMany Chileans talk of waiting a year for an appointment with a specialist, or families receiving calls to finally set up appointments for loved ones who died months earlier. Hundreds of thousands are hobbled by educational loans that can follow them into their 40s and even 50s.\n\n\u201cCountries with high levels of inequality such as Chile are like recovering alcoholics. They can be well for many years, but they shouldn\u2019t forget they have a problem,\u201d said Patricio Navia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University. \u201cInequality is a threat to Chile\u2019s stability.\u201d\n\nAlexis Moreira Arenas, 37, and his wife Stephanie Carrasco, 36, are comfortably in the middle class but he pays some 10 percent of his salary to a privately run pension system that generates steady profits for fund managers but an average pension around $300 a month, roughly a third of what a retired person needs to live. She is still paying off $110 a month in college loans, about 10 percent of their income. Another 30 percent goes to private preschool for their 2-year-old son.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a series of problems that all come together; public transport, education, health, because the health system here works really badly,\u201d Moreria said. \u201cAbove all, it\u2019s a question of inequality.\u201d\n\nProtesters in O\u2019Higgins Park said President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era\u2019s firing of his Cabinet Saturday would do nothing to calm the streets. Almost uniformly, they said they would continue protesting until they saw fundamental changes in Chile, starting with the replacement of the 1980 constitution, written under military dictator Augusto Pinochet, that creates the legal basis of Chile\u2019s market-driven system. Already, there were calls Sunday evening on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for protests every day of the coming week.\n\n\u201cThe whole constitution makes me angry,\u201d said Alan Vicencio, a 25-year-old call-center worker. \u201cThe constitution allowed the privatization of every aspect of our lives and it\u2019s being doing it for more than 30 years.\u201d\n\nFrom afar, Chile has been a regional success story \u2014 under democratically elected presidents on the left and right, a free-market consensus has driven growth up, poverty down and won Chile the region\u2019s highest score on the United Nations Human Development Index, a blend of life expectancy, education and national income per capita.\n\nIn 2010, Chile became the second Latin member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, after Mexico. Next month, Pi\u00f1era will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, followed by the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2017 UN report found that the richest 1% of the population earns 33 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth. That helps make Chile the most unequal country in the OECD, slightly worse than Mexico. Pi\u00f1era himself is a billionaire, one of the country\u2019s richest men.\n\nRoxana Pisarro, a 52-year-old kindergarten teacher, stood in O\u2019Higgins Park holding a hand-letter sign reading, \u201cI\u2019m marching for my 76-year-old mother who works seven days a week because her miserable pension isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nPisarro said her mother, a retired clothing-factory worker, bakes at home and sells empanadas and fried bread in their neighborhood on the outskirts of Santiago, often until 11 p.m., in order to support herself, her granddaughter and her great-grandson on a pension of $165 a month.\n\n\u201cAverage people see this prosperous country, the star of Latin America, they see skyscrapers and four Maseratis sold every month, a luxury shopping district where they sell purses worth $4,000, and where are they compared to five years ago? They\u2019re stuck,\u201d said Marta Lagos, director of the Santiago-based polling firm Latinobarometro. \u201cThis 30 peso rise in metro fares was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. They said \u2018Not a step further. We\u2019re tired of waiting.'\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "From afar, Chile has been a regional success story, but the richest 1% of the population earns 33 percent of the nation's wealth.", "authors": ["Michael Weissenstein", "Eva Vergara"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19298832895843.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C726px%2C5055px%2C2646px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
