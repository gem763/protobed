'If I'm gonna do it, it has to be with a girl.'\n\n'I wasn't planning that, but if it happened\u2026' Tamra trailed off, staring at her friend.\n\nShannon, who'd spent her birthday trying to find a man to kiss, drunkenly asked Tamra to kiss her 'on the lips, but no licking,' then wandered over and chastely kissed Braunwyn, too.\n\n'I like women's lips,' Braunwyn said, then she passionately French-kissed Tamra for a long time.\n\nMaking out: The reality stars openly kissed each other while at a restaurant table\n\n'I know girls kiss girls, but they're not lesbians, so how are they doing this and why are they enjoying it?' asked a panicky Vicki Gunvalson, 57, in a confessional.\n\nAs everyone got even more drunk, Kelly Dodd, 44, ended up dancing with a bouncer, Tamra and Braunwyn got half-naked on a banquette, and Shannon smooched a stranger named Marco.\n\n'I feel like I'm in a sex show,' marveled Emily Simpson, 43. 'Like, am I in Amsterdam?'\n\nKiss mission: Shannon Beador was looking to kiss a guy on her birthday and met Marcos\n\nMission accomplished: The birthday girl kissed Marcos as she celebrated her birthday\n\n'I'm the one with the rumors?' Kelly asked, as Tamra's breasts fell out. 'Look at these chicks!'\n\nAs the episode began, everyone took a train to Del Mar, California, to celebrate their pal's birthday, with Tamra bringing along a penis-shaped flask and candy penis for Shannon.\n\n'I figured you can't pull a train without some penises,' she joked, referring to the rumor that Vicki had spread months before about Kelly having sex with multiple men in a row.\n\nGood one: Kelly Dodd joked about her sex rumors as her friends kissed each other and strangers\n\nTension was in the air, as Emily and pal Gina Kirschenheiter, 35, had been feuding since Emily set Gina up with her husband's cousin, who turned out to have a girlfriend.\n\nGina, who'd just divorced a man who cheated on her, was upset to encounter another prospect with a romantic commitment, and blamed Emily, refusing to return her calls or texts.\n\nAs all the women arrived for the party, they took a photo with a banner that read Hot Mess Express, and jumped aboard an Amtrak train bound for the beach.\n\nTrain ride: The women took the Hot Mess Express down to Del Mar for Shannon's birthday\n\n'The rumor of having a train, it's so absurd, you have to laugh and make a joke of it,' Kelly reflected as they rode. 'I mean, I would be lucky if eight guys liked me at once.'\n\nOn the train, the ladies started passing around Shannon's edible penis, with the birthday girl biting off the tip, Kelly deep-throating it, and Tamra taking 'a bite of the balls.'\n\n'I can't, I can't,' murmured former RHOC star Meghan King Edmonds, 35, who had showed up for Shannon. 'It's embarrassing.'\n\nEdible penis: The ladies started passing around Shannon's edible penis with Tamra taking 'a bite of the balls\n\nOral simulation: Kelly simulated oral sex with the edible penis\n\n'I hate giving blowjobs,' said Braunwyn. 'I haven't given one since '97, unless it's for a really nice handbag.'\n\nKelly told the women she was 'having a dilemma' about her boyfriend, Dr. Brian Reagan, and wondered if she should be upset that he failed to check in with her one day.\n\n'You should check in!' she insisted, as they sympathized. 'And then he called me insecure!'\n\nDoctor dilemma: The reality star told her friends about her doctor boyfriend Brian not checking in with her\n\nText message: Kelly shared text messages in which Brian called her 'insecure'\n\nOver drinks at Poseidon Restaurant, Shannon said that she'd blow the whistle around her neck if she saw anyone that was hot enough for either her or Gina.\n\nGina tried to deflect talk about her issues with Emily, who mistakenly thought her friend was telling everyone, and fled to the bathroom to avoid it.\n\n'I've tried to call her and text her for two days, and she doesn't respond, but she's going to sit there at the table and tell everyone else why she's mad at me,' Emily told Meghan.\n\nStood up: Gina tried to deflect talk about her issues with Emily who set her up on a double date gone wrong\n\n'I don't even understand what's going on,' she fulminated. 'She acts like I f***ing murdered someone or something. I set her up on a double date. It didn't work out.'\n\nGina was forced to head to the bathroom to deal with Emily, and was incensed that Emily was spilling everything to Meghan, whom she barely knew.\n\n'Who the f*** is Meghan?' she asked. 'I just met this girl, and you're gonna spill your guts to her in the bathroom?'\n\nSpeaking out: Emily told former RHOC cast member Meghan King Edmonds about her issues with Gina\n\nThey failed to make up, with both of them shouting about how 'pissed' they were at each other, and Emily storming off to get a car ride home.\n\n'I'm allowed to be upset at my friends, and it doesn't mean that all of a sudden I've abandoned you,' Gina told an obviously uncomfortable Meghan. 'She has abandonment issues.'\n\nMeghan returned to the table, saying: 'I have, like, other things to f***ing worry about.'\n\nToo much: Meghan returned to the table with more important things to worry about\n\nKelly, Tamra, and Shannon headed out to keep Emily from leaving, but the fight escalated.\n\n'That's bulls***,' Gina said, as Emily harangued her. 'I'm done.'\n\nThe party rolled on to a bar called Sbicca, where the ladies did shots of Don Julio tequila.\n\nTaking off: Emily tried to leave but was coaxed to remain by Kelly and Tamra\n\nTamra told Shannon that she needed to get laid, but Shannon was holding out for a kiss, calling herself 'innocent' and hoping to find someone who was 'whistle-worthy.'\n\nThe declaration of innocence made Tamra laugh, saying Shannon was a 'nasty motherf***er,' and Vicki yelled 'Shannon, you're a whore,' as their fellow restaurant patrons looked on, aghast.\n\n'Maybe she wants me to kiss her vagina,' Tamra said.\n\nGood times: Shannon after past disappointments around her birthday was having a fun time celebrating her 55th with her gal pals\n\n'No, I don't,' Shannon protested.\n\n'Yes, you do,' Kelly affirmed, noting privately that Shannon had recently gotten the O-Shot, which stimulates the clitoris and vagina and enhances sex.\n\n'55 is gonna rock!' Shannon bellowed, doing a shot.\n\nNifty fifties: The reality star declared that 55 was going to rock\n\n'55! AARP!' Kelly added, as Shannon threw a lime at her and called her an 'a**hole.'\n\nTamra walked around the restaurant, calling, 'Anybody single? Shannon's looking to get laid!' but she found no takers.\n\nShe then plopped down in front of Braunwyn and asked, 'So when are we gonna make out?'\n\nMutual admiration: Tamra and Braunwyn shared their mutual admiration for each other\n\n'So soon,' Braunwyn replied. 'I feel like it's gonna be our new thing.'\n\n'Well, you kinda did already,' Gina, sitting between them, pointed out, remembering how the women got a little handsy with each other on a drunken night in Arizona.\n\n'I feel like I just met Braunwyn, and she's like, ''Hi, how are you doing? I have threesomes with my husband'',' she added in a confessional, laughing.\n\nTongue twister: Braunwyn and Tamra flicked their tongues while kissing\n\n'When Sean's going down on me and I close my eyes, it's me, him and another girl,' Braunwyn said to Tamra, who yelled 'Yes!'\n\nEmily leaned over and told Gina, 'I love you. I swear on my children's life, I would never put you in a situation where you would be hurt or embarrassed, and you have to believe that.'\n\n'I'm never gonna f***ing leave you,' Gina reassured her, as they made up. 'But you should know, I'm gonna come in that bathroom, and I'm gonna talk to you.'\n\nNever leave: Gina Kirschenheiter vowed to Emily that she would not abandon their friendship\n\n'My hand is stuck in your crotch!' Tamra screamed behind them, as Braunwyn climbed into her lap, saying 'Do it again! Do it again!'\n\n'I do not do girls,' Kelly observed. 'I'm buy-sexual. Buy me something, then I'll be sexual.'\n\n'Through the lips, down the hatch, I hope tonight you get some snatch,' Tamra toasted Shannon.\n\n'I don't want any snatch,' Shannon said, as Vicki tried to get Tamra to leave.\n\nGetting close: Tamra got her hand stuck in Braunwyn's crotch and asked in a confessional if it was cheating if a woman was involved\n\n'We're dating. We're like, committed. Will you be my girlfriend?' Braunwyn asked Tamra.\n\n'Listen, I married a guy five years younger than me for a reason, but there's nothing wrong with a little threesome once in a while, okay?' Tamra said.\n\n'When I had sex with Eddie the other night, I thought about Braunwyn!' she told the table.\n\nSex talk: Braunwyn listened as Tamra revealed she thought about her while having sex with her husband Eddie\n\nBraunwyn and Tamra said they thought about women 'every time' they had sex.\n\n'But what's the girl doing?' Shannon asked.\n\n'Reading Shakespeare,' Braunwyn cracked.\n\n'I just don't find vaginas appetizing,' Kelly said. 'Penises are pretty, way better than vaginas.'\n\nShe shot a video of Tamra drunkenly falling out of the chair she was sharing with Braunwyn, and getting piled on by Vicki and Shannon.\n\nFalling down: Tamra took a tumble while drunk at the restaurant\n\n'I'm up!' Shannon said as she jumped up, and the restaurant applauded.\n\nShe then made a touching speech, saying: 'My birthday has not been a good day for me for a lot of years, and I just thought, I don't even want to celebrate\u2026 and I have to honestly say, my stomach hurts right now, because I have laughed so much today.'\n\nWhen they went next door to Jimmy O's, Kelly tried to pay a worker $200 to dance with Shannon and flick his tongue around her face, but he picked her up instead.\n\nCandles out: Shannon blew out candles while celebrating her birthday with friends in Del Mar\n\nVicki decided to leave when the ladies started dirty-dancing, telling a pal that Braunwyn 'bugs the s*** out of me' for needing attention, calling her 'classless' and 'trash.'\n\n'I'm drunk and I'm over it,' she confirmed.\n\nThe next day, Kelly met with Brian to sort things out, and he told her that he occasionally needed 'downtime,' and she needed to understand that.\n\nOver it: Vicki Gunvalson was bothered by Braunwyn and left early\n\nHe also noted that she'd bought his son a Playstation without asking him, and pointed out that her daughter Jolie, 13, went to her camp on a private jet, which Kelly said all her pals had.\n\n'If I want to give my daughter a $10,000 camp experience\u2026 then that's my business,' she confessed, saying she liked spoiling her daughter, but tried to teach her compassion, too.\n\nShe told him she'd danced with a bouncer the night before, but didn't give him her number.\n\n'Good girl,' Brian said.\n\nThe Real Housewives Of Orange County will return next week on Bravo.", "description": "Shannon Beador's 55th birthday party turned steamy on Tuesday's episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County, as two castmates continually kissed each other.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/07/19774564-0-image-a-113_1571206430709.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
