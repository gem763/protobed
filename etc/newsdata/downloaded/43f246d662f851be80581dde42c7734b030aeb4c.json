REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nPolice fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nA series of protests for and against the city\u2019s Communist Party rulers in Beijing is planned ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic on Tuesday, including at the consulate of former colonial power Britain.\n\nThousands, young and old, gathered peacefully on Saturday at a harborside park to mark the fifth anniversary of the \u201cUmbrella\u201d pro-democracy movement which gridlocked streets for 79 days in 2014.\n\nThen the violence began, following a pattern of the last few weeks.\n\nAnti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing\u2019s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalized metro stations and set street fires.\n\nPolice have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\nProtests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China.
