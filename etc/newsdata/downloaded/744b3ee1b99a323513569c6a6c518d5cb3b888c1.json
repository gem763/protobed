Lots of candidates \u2014 possibly in the hopes that were Biden to exit the race, they would inherit his fandom \u2014 have avoided taking such a direct swipe in a debate setting.\n\nRead more: 'I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not': Julian Castro comes out swinging at Biden over healthcare in Democratic debate\n\nThat's not a great strategy, and here's why.\n\nInsider has been conducting a series of recurring polls that ask who among the candidates a respondent would be satisfied with. This allows us to gauge overlapping constituencies and look at dynamics in the race that can't be captured looking at just the important topline numbers.\n\nHow the Insider 2020 Democratic primary tracker works\n\nData as of mid-August Business Insider\n\nThe last time a candidate came hard for Biden on national television, Kamala Harris was raking him over the coals for his policy on busing in the 1970s, personalizing a policy impact and landing a solid hit on the elder statesman.\n\nLet's assume the position \u2014 one encouraged tonight by candidates like Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 that taking a significant swipe at a frontrunning rival like Castro did is bad. If such a thing was actually bad, if a debate getting divisive and contentious had the purported negative consequences so many of the candidates seem to fear, we'd expect the following things to happen.\n\nAfter landing the attack on Biden, his supporters would clam up and reject Harris for the heresy.\n\nSupporters of Harris who were fond of Biden would pick a side, and she would lose some of that support.\n\nHarris would be seen as a pariah for going low in a political debate and would struggle to gain support.\n\nCandidates who played nice \u2014 like Beto O'Rourke or Pete Buttigieg \u2014 would see support as viewers reward their comportment and politesse.\n\nHere's what actually happened after the first debate, when Harris went for Biden's jugular.\n\nIn the five polls preceding the debate on average 59% of Democratic voters were aware of Harris.\n\nIn the five polls that came after the debate on average 66% of Democratic voters were aware of Harris\n\nof Democratic voters were aware of Harris In the polls before the debate, 83% of voters knew of Biden. In the polls after, 84% did.\n\nIn those polls before the debate, 39% of Biden supporters were also satisfied with Harris.\n\nIn those polls after the debate, 48% of Biden supporters were also satisfied with Harris. That's a 9-percentage point increase. That's enormous.\n\nIn the polls before, 67% of Harris supporters also like Biden. Afterwards, 62% did.\n\nAlso the percentage of people who knew of Harris that were satisfied with her as nominee jumped 7 points.\n\nBeto, who kept his hands clean, saw his awareness jump one percentage point. For likely unrelated reasons the percentage who were satisfied with him fell 8 percentage points.\n\nSo by the mere act of getting in the fight with the person liked by the most people, Harris increased her name recognition, she presented herself as a rival to Biden and wooed a number of his supporters even if they didn't let go of their top choice, and she also locked down more of her supporters who had been flirting with Biden. Her rivals, who were behaved, were unaffected.\n\nDebating at debates is good, who could have guessed it!\n\nData as of mid-August Business Insider For Castro, nobody's in a better position to land a clean hit on Biden than this former Obama administration colleague. And Castro has so much to gain and very little to lose. Sure, about two thirds of his fans like Biden, but remember there seems to be very little risk on that front.\n\nOnly 17% of those satisfied with Biden are also satisfied with Castro, according to the latest data. That's really low \u2014 11 percentage points lower than his overall satisfaction rate among Democrats \u2014 and a prime opportunity. Castro realized that debates are a great chance to mix it up, because only by mixing it up do you have other candidate's fans seriously pay attention to you.\n\nThis is why Mayor Pete Buttigieg's scolding and Sen. Amy Klobuchar's reticence to directly attack Biden \u2014 who has all those moderates she wants to voter for her \u2014 is all the more frustrating.\n\nFully 75% of Klobuchar's supporters also like Biden.\n\nA mere 17% of Biden supporters also like Klobuchar. That is below her overall performance among Democrats by 10 points.\n\nA third of Biden supporters like Buttigieg, but that's a whopping 16 points below his overall performance among Democrats.\n\nButtigieg's focus on Warren makes a bit more sense in context when you realise that they are far from ideological rivals, but more that 75% of Buttigieg supporters would also be satisfied with Warren as a nominee, making her a fairly immediate threat.\n\nHarris, still doing good. Data as of mid-August Business Insider\n\nThis may be a wasted opportunity. There's another debate for each of these middling contenders, but no guarantee they ever share a stage with the frontrunner again.\n\nKlobuchar and Buttigieg played nice at a time when it may have been optimal to land a solid blow. Castro \u2014 and to a lesser extent Booker, but moreso after - saw an opportunity and went for it. This isn't a mixer, it's a debate, and it's not a roundtable conversation, there's an expectation that things get political. While some may see an advantage here in playing it cool and not coming off as feisty, that's not actually how debates work. Only a few of the candidates have realized that, and it'll soon be too late for the rest if they don't.\n\nBusiness Insider is interested in hearing from voters who are following the 2020 Republican primary about questions they have for candidates.
