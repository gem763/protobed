The investment is expected to cost $20 million, and while the company reiterated its sales guidance, it cut its 2020 outlook.\n\nAnalyst reaction to Wendy\u2019s fourth attempt at breakfast is mixed, though primarily cautious. Although there is opportunity for profit, some analysts are unsure the chain\u2019s hefty investment will pay off.\n\nWendy\u2019s currently serves breakfast in roughly 300 restaurants but will add it to more than 5,000 U.S. stores in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised by the announcement given the resources and time required to launch the daypart, a tight labor market, high levels of competition, ongoing reimage program, and previous commentary noting other sales opportunities exist outside of the breakfast daypart,\u201d wrote Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cWe are cautious on execution, as this will mark the fourth time Wendy\u2019s has attempted breakfast, and believe incremental company and franchise investments could pressure margins and earnings,\u201d she added.\n\nSilberman laid out Wendy\u2019s three previous attempts at breakfast, all of which have been unsuccessful.\n\n1985: Initial launch, discontinued less than a year later in most of its stores\n\n2006: Breakfast tested again but ended in 2009\n\n2009: Breakfast tested in three concentrated markets but ended by 2013.\n\nThis Jan. 29, 2012 photo, shows signage promoting breakfast is at a Wendy's restaurant in Culver City, Calif. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon) More\n\nStill, Silberman added if the rollout is successful, breakfast could be a meaningful sales driver given the fact that Wendy\u2019s has historically indicated breakfast could represent about 10% of sales.\n\nHowever, she noted that Wendy\u2019s \u201crequires more preparation, and more labor, relative to competitors given its use of fresh ingredients, which has likely been a headwind in profitability at breakfast.\u201d\n\nAs part of the rollout, Wendy\u2019s said it intends to hire 20,000 new employees to support its initiative.\n\nBut Wells Fargo analyst Jon Tower is not as bearish on the company\u2019s renewed endeavor.\n\n\u201cWendy\u2019s unexpected move into breakfast should not be all that surprising, in our view,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTower cited a note from November 2018 in which he argued why breakfast should be re-examined by the company:\n\nThe category represents about 22% of fast-food restaurant traffic and the brand\u2019s absence from the space left Wendy\u2019s at a significant competitive disadvantage Franchisees may benefit (and prefer) focusing on an initiative that improves store-level productivity, as opposed to adding new capacity to an already crowded field Wendy\u2019s could approach this daypart with a less labor-intensive option (i.e., drive-thru only) and could disrupt the space through value & innovation (i.e., free coffee with every food purchase).\n\nWells Fargo has a $20 price target on the stock, with a Market Perform rating.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that Wendy\u2019s needs to demonstrate improved visibility into core fundamental, long-term growth drivers in order for the shares to see greater multiple expansion from here,\u201d wrote Tower.\n\nMeanwhile, Guggenheim Securities and BTIG downgraded shares from Buy to Neutral.\n\nAs of Tuesday\u2019s close, the consensus rating on Wendy\u2019s stock was 13 Buys, 14 Holds and 1 Sell, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nLooking ahead, Wendy\u2019s said in a statement it intends to update its guidance at its Investor Day on October 11. More details regarding the expected financial impact of entering the breakfast daypart are expected to be announced then as well.\n\nPamela Granda is a producer on Yahoo Finance\u2019s closing bell show, The Final Round.
