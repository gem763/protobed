However, he admitted that it wasn\u2019t perfect.\n\nThe greatest danger was that the impeachment process would be abused for partisan purposes. Hamilton feared that an opposing party\u2019s desire to impeach a president might be so strong that they would \u201cenlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side\u2026.\u201d\n\nHe wrote that, in such a case, the strength of the political parties\u2014not the actual culpability of the president\u2014would determine the outcome: \u201cin such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi have abandoned the procedural protections that occurred in previous impeachments, most importantly open hearings, the right to confront and cross-examine one\u2019s accuser, and the right to call one\u2019s own witnesses. Those protections are at the very core of due process. Without them, it is easy to distort evidence to make an innocent person appear guilty.\n\nAnd what about their charge against President Trump? Would the alleged quid pro quo \u2013 even if it did exist \u2013 constitute \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d as required by Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution?\n\nThe Founders chose this definition of an impeachable offense over the broader term \u201cmaladministration,\u201d in order to narrow what would be considered an impeachable offense and to guard against impeachment being abused for partisan political ends.\n\nWith respect to foreign affairs, the Founding Fathers set the standard for impeachable offenses quite high. The President either had to commit outright treason, defined in Article III, Section 3, of the Constitution as \u201clevying War against [the United States], or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.,\u201d or he had to betray the interests of the United States in favor of the interests of a foreign country. As James Madison put it, a president \u201cmight betray his trust to foreign powers.\u201d Hamilton used similar terms in describing all impeachable offenses: they involved \u201cthe abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d\n\nWith this definition in mind, it\u2019s clear that President Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky does not involve what the Founders would consider an impeachable offense. In no way did President Trump provide aid and comfort to an enemy of the United States; in no way did he elevate Ukrainian interests at the expense of American interests; and in no way did he otherwise violate the public trust through deception or betrayal.\n\nIt is also relevant that Secretary of State Pompeo and numerous others were listening in on the call. It is unlikely that any president would knowingly do something inimical to American interests or betray the trust of the American people while so many American officials were listening.\n\nIn short, the Schiff sham is exactly what the Founding Fathers did not want the impeachment process to become \u2013 a partisan exercise, devoid of due process, concerning non-impeachable actions by a president.\n\nKris W.
