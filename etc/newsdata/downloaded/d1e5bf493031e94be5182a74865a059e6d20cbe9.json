Warren/AP Images\n\nStarbucks has agreed to provide the SEC further information about how it recognizes revenue after questions over its accounting practices.\n\nShares of the coffee-chain slid as much as 5.2% on Tuesday.\n\nThe slide comes shortly after shares declined when Starbucks said earnings wouldn't grow as much in 2020 as it had previously forecast.\n\nWatch Starbucks trade live on Markets Insider.\n\nStarbucks is cooperating with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and adding disclosures about how it recognizes revenue after some of the coffee chain's accounting practices were questioned, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe SEC had asked for clarity around revenue-recognition practices. The coffee chain has agreed to provide the SEC more information about how it recognizes revenue, according to the WSJ.\n\nShares of Starbucks fell as much as 5.2% Tuesday.\n\nStarbucks is one of many US companies that the SEC has asked about revenue-recognition practices since 2018, when new accounting guidelines came into effect that change how different companies record revenue from sales and services. At least 208 companies \u2014 a 56% increase year over year \u2014got letters from the SEC in 2018, the WSJ reported.\n\nIn routine letters sent between May and August, the SEC questioned how Starbucks recognizes revenue in quarterly filings that ended March 31. The SEC asked a number of questions about how Starbucks counts revenue from services, and also asked the company to explain how it recorded the $7 billion payment from Nestle SA in 2018 for the exclusive right to sell Starbucks products.\n\nIn addition, a change in how Starbucks accounts for gift cards made it harder for the SEC to tell how much revenue the company received from the Nestle deal, the WSJ reported.\n\n\"Since adopting the new revenue-recognition accounting standard at the beginning of FY19\u2014well before we received an SEC comment letter on this topic\u2014we consistently disclosed the impact of this standard on our reported results . . . including the impact on breakage income and operating margin . . . in our quarterly earnings releases, on our quarterly earnings calls and in our 10-Qs,\" a spokesperson for the company told Markets Insider.\n\n\"As a result of these SEC communications, we are not changing our accounting but are providing some additional disclosure to further clarify our adoption of new revenue-recognition accounting standards,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe report comes just a week after Starbucks stock slid the most in 7 months after the company said in an investor presentation that its earnings won't grow as much in 2020 as it previously thought. The new estimate of earnings-per-share growth of 8% to 10% fell short of Starbucks' previous forecast of at least 13% growth for 2020.\n\nShares of Starbucks are up roughly 41% year to date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Starbucks has reportedly agreed to provide the SEC further information about how it recognizes revenue after questions over its accounting practices.\u00a0...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d52abb1cd97840b7b067df4-1999/ap19074640345562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
