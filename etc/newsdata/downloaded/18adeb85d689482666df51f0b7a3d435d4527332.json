I was honored to attend Thursday.\n\nWith few details made public before the event, many national news outlets sharply criticized the meeting \u2013 just as you might expect virulent anti-Trump journalists would.\n\nCNN warned that \u201cright-wing extremists\u201d would invade the White House. The New York Times labeled attendees at the summit \u201cright-wing social media trolls.\u201d Vanity Fair even dubbed it a \u201ctroll convention.\u201d And NBC News accused participants of \u201cspreading false information.\u201d\n\nBut those so-called journalists were the ones spreading fake news. Why? Because their power is threatened by social media\u2019s reach and influence. Social media empower Americans to bypass these traditional gatekeepers with a few taps on a smartphone.\n\nAs Trump told us at the summit: \u201cYou communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake news filter. It\u2019s very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network, by far. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, attendees at the social media summit \u2013 through their personal accounts and organizations \u2013 reach more than 500 million people around the world. That\u2019s an astonishing number and one of the reasons I\u2019m glad Trump struck a celebratory tone at the summit.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of summit participants \u2013 about 250 digital leaders, social media influencers, and members of Congress \u2013 aren\u2019t trolls and certainly aren\u2019t extremists. But branding us as such serves a purpose: to undermine our credibility.\n\nWhat I saw at the social media summit were freedom-loving Americans who believe deeply in the principles articulated in the First Amendment.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that some attendees push the limits and engage in behavior I don\u2019t support. But they\u2019re doing something truly American \u2013 exercising their free speech. And they\u2019re doing it through the transformative power of social media.\n\nNo one has benefited more from social media than Trump himself. His use of Twitter allows him to communicate directly with the American people, bypassing hostile journalists who put their own spin on it. He\u2019s been able to wrest control away from the mainstream media with a single tweet.\n\n\u201cWe hardly do press releases anymore,\u201d Trump said, explaining his communications style. \u201cPeople don\u2019t pick it up. It\u2019s me, same. If I put it out on social media, it\u2019s like an explosion.\u201d\n\nAlthough Twitter gets most of the attention, Trump and conservatives are also having success on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, where increasing numbers of Americans get their news and information.\n\nThis is why concerns about bias and censorship from those who run the tech giants are so important and worrisome.\n\nAt the Heritage Foundation, where I serve as vice president for communications and executive editor of The Daily Signal, we have sometimes found our content removed by social media companies. Fortunately, we successfully used market pressure to reverse those poor decisions.\n\nLast year, for example, Facebook removed a Daily Signal video of a pediatrician warning about the dangers of puberty blockers for children. The video skyrocketed to 70 million views at a staggering pace. Then suddenly it was gone \u2013 disappeared entirely from our Facebook Watch page.\n\nWe were outraged and let Facebook know this was unacceptable. It was thanks to the pressure we applied to Facebook that the video was eventually restored \u2013 with an apology.\n\nMore recently, a Heritage Foundation employee was suspended from Twitter for allegedly engaging in \u201chateful conduct\u201d by using a pronoun the company considered \u201cmisgendering.\u201d\n\nThe accusation was absurd, and several news organizations pointed out the ridiculousness of the situation. As public pressure mounted on Twitter to reverse its decision, Twitter restored the account and apologized to the user it suspended.\n\nThere are numerous other examples of social media companies responding to market pressure to change their practices and reverse their decisions. Notably, these companies have hired conservatives to address their shortcomings and respond to such concerns.\n\nStill, many users remain frustrated with their own experiences and the incredible power of left-leaning Silicon Valley to control their ability to communicate.\n\nThere are better alternatives than government to address these challenges. Everyone who cares about free speech, regardless of their political beliefs, should want social media companies to be responsive to their users, not government. And conservatives especially should be fearful of heavy-handed regulation as a solution to their concerns.\n\nTrump promised to bring the social media companies to Washington for a follow-up meeting in the next month where he would push for \u201cmore transparency, more accountability, and more freedom.\u201d\n\nThat meeting will serve as a good opportunity to debate the challenges, but it should also be a time to celebrate the success of social media. After all, despite the allegations of bias and censorship, conservatives are still dominating and Trump is leading the way.\n\nMost importantly, the president has given us an opportunity to recommit ourselves to free speech. That\u2019s a principle that all Americans \u2013 and all social media companies \u2013 should embrace.", "description": "Donald Trump is America\u2019s first true social media president, so it was only natural that he would convene the first-ever\u00a0social media summit\u00a0at the White House.
