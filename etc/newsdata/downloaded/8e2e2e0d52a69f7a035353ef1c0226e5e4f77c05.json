There will also be a publicly accessible roof garden, and shops on the ground floor.\n\n\u010cern\u00fd is famed for his controversial works including Entropa, a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech Republic's presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2009 that depicts each EU country using a national stereotype.\n\nFrance can be seen covered in a banner which reads \"Greve!\" (Strike!), while Belgium is a box of half eaten chocolates and Sweden is an IKEA box.\n\n\u010cern\u00fd's proposed tower will be situated near the Nov\u00e9 Butovice metro stop in the city suburbs.\n\nPrague's historic downtown is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and high-rise buildings are completely banned in the city center.\n\nTrigema\n\n\"We have been preparing the Top Tower project for more than two years and the final version was preceded by eight other alternative proposals,\" said Marcel Soural, Chairman of the Board of Trigema.\n\n\"During this time, we have collected and are still collecting input from experts, affected national and local authorities, and of course the local public, whose representatives have already been and will continue to participate in a number of participatory negotiations.\"\n\nIf approved, construction could start in 2021 and take three years, according to Trigema.\n\nThe project will cost 2 billion Czech Crowns ($84.5 million).", "description": "The Top Tower, a planned project that looks like an oil tanker crashed into a office block, could become the tallest building in Prague if approved by planning authorities.", "authors": ["Jack Guy"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926115441-01-prague-top-tower-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
