He's since chosen to slim down. James Brickwood\n\nMe? I'm sick of looking fat-faced in photos. I hate the fact I wear the same clothes week in, week out, when I've got a wardrobe full of others that I'd love to wear again. It's not like I'm morbidly obese. You're not going to see the beaming, slimline me photographed standing in a pair of my cavernous old trousers nor will I end up with folds of excess skin hanging off me once I reach my target weight. But I do need to lose about 7kg and I'm determined to do it in time for my 50th birthday in November.\n\nBut it's hard work getting in shape when you're close to 50 \u2013 and it's nothing to do with me being lazy. Well, not entirely. As men age, levels of testosterone and human growth hormone, which helps regulate the body, deteriorate, making it harder to burn calories and build muscle, so your muscle mass decreases. Men can lose up to 500g of muscle mass each year by the age of 50 \u2013 it's replaced instead by new layers of fat that congregate around the stomach and the chest. In short, the creeping onset of moobs and the middle-aged spread.\n\nSo how do you fight back? Well, eat less, eat better and do more exercise. Simple, right? Well, yes and no. It obviously helps if you can get to the gym and, more importantly, if you have a personal trainer there who'll kick you in the kettlebells when he or she thinks you're slacking.\n\nMy trainer is exactly the kind of tough taskmaster I need to whip me into shape, laughing mercilessly at my sorry press-ups then making me do more. Not only do they provide personalised workouts, but they'll also give you diet tips with daily food plans to help you count those calories. The fact that they weigh and measure you each week certainly helps with motivation too.\n\nThe image that produced the body policing of Chris Hemsworth (as Thor in 'Avengers Endgame'.

Instead, stick to proteins like fish, eggs and nuts, good fats like those found in avocados and healthy carbs like sweet potato. Cutting down on sugar is essential, as is planning your food. Make a meal plan each week, go out and buy the food you need and stick to it. It's not easy, particularly in the early stages, and especially at weekends, when the temptation to have just one glass of wine can turn into one too many.\n\nFortunately, technology can help. I have an app called My Fitness Pal that was recommended by a friend who looks after himself properly. It logs each and every calorie that passes my lips and offsets them against the exercise I do each day. It also charts my weight, whether I'm on track to reach my target weight and, I suspect, how fantastically dull I've become since I've been on this health kick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in 2004, I interviewed golfer Colin Montgomerie in one of his leaner periods and talk turned to his dramatic weight loss. \"Nothing,\" he told me, \"tastes as good as slim feels.\"\n\nWhile Monty may have lifted that line from Kate Moss, he had a point, because when you start to see real results it can quickly become an obsession. I've lost 4.5kg in six weeks. My biceps are 3cm bigger, my belly is down by the same and I've got a jawline.

Create a weekly routine, mixing cardio with strength training. Factor in a swim or a cycle. Variety is less laborious. You can't out-train a bad diet. It's a gym gang clich\u00e9 but true. Eat well and limit your calories to about 1500 a day. Ban the booze. Alcohol's empty calories will do for any weight loss plan. Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge shed 76kg, largely by knocking booze on the head. Be realistic. Losing a couple of pounds a week is a sensible rate, giving you a greater chance of keeping the weight off. Have early nights. Getting a good night's sleep is vital as failing to do so can affect your training and lead to appetite surges. Seven hours should be a minimum.\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "There was a time when men could slovenly slide into their middle-age without anyone ever casting a disapproving eye over their fuller figures.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5258%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_415%2C$y_405/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/de484ece08e3c8e8a75a8460dad3e2cb38ae44fd", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
