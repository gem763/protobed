Its videos, which have garnered more than 30 billion views and according to Forbes, made Kaji the eighth-highest-paid YouTube entrepreneur, having brought in $11 million in revenue between 2016 and 2017.\n\nYOUTUBE STAR TANA MONGEAU STIRS UP CONTROVERSY BRINGING LIVE SNAKE TO VMA RED CARPET\n\nIn 2018, the young child star secured his top spot among the ranks of the video platform\u2019s highest earners, bringing in $22 million of revenue from his videos and separate product line at Walmart, who has been looking to overtake the market share held by Toys R Us.\n\nThat income also stems from an account with his family called \"Ryan's Family Review,\" in which Ryan's younger twin sisters, mother, and father give fans an inside look into the family's life, according to the money magazine.\n\nThe millionaire boy\u2019s reviews have become so popular among children that in the fall of 2018 he was able to launch \"Ryan's World,\" a toy line created in partnership with Bonkers Toy Co. The products, which include putty, goo, and toy cars and dolls, are sold through Walmart, Target and Amazon.\n\nIn July, Kaji also released a line of toothpaste and toothbrushes that bear his name and logo.\n\nKaji\u2019s father issued a statement to Fox Business on Monday and said they follow the rules and regulations of online advertising closely and support the measures the FTC set in place to protect children.\n\n\u201cThe well-being of our viewers is always the top priority for us and we strictly follow all platforms\u2019 terms of service and all existing laws and regulations, including advertising disclosure requirements,\" Shion Kaji said in a statement to Fox Business.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"As the streaming space continues to quickly grow and evolve, we support efforts by lawmakers, industry representatives, and regulators such as the FTC to continuously evaluate and update existing guidelines and lay new ground rules to protect both viewers and creators.\"\n\nAccording to Truth In Advertising, numerous of major companies have sponsored endorsements on Ryan ToyReviews' YouTube channel, including Colgate, Chuck E.
