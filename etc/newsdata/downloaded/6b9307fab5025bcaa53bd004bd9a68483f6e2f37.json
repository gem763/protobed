Just two days later, he filed a criminal complaint in Turkey against Le Point\u2019s editor-in-chief Etienne Gernelle and the article\u2019s author, Romain Gubert. The pair allegedly \u201cinsulted the president\u201d and expressions used in the article amounted to slander that cannot be justified by the freedom of speech concept, the complaint said.\n\nIn addition to legal action, the Turkish president\u2019s office issued a scorching response to the publication, targeting France as a whole. Erdogan\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter that it was not up to the French to lecture anyone about \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d given the country\u2019s bloody colonial past.\n\n\u201cFrance, that colonized many African countries like Algeria and Morocco, that massacred thousands of people, practiced the slave trade and watched the genocide in Rwanda. And a French magazine launches a slander of ethnic cleansing against us!\u201d Kalin stated.\n\nLa France qui a colonis\u00e9 de nombreux pays africains comme l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie et le Maroc, qui a massacr\u00e9 des milliers de personnes, pratiqu\u00e9 le commerce des esclaves et qui a regard\u00e9 le g\u00e9nocide au Rwanda.\n\nEt un magazine fran\u00e7ais qui a lanc\u00e9 une calomnie de nettoyage ethnique contre nous! pic.twitter.com/nmc2CuY7h6 \u2014 Ibrahim Kalin (@ikalin1) 24 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433.\n\nThe true reason behind such attacks is the \u201chard blows\u201d Ankara delivered to the French \u201cpawns\u201d in Syria, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), the spokesman claimed.\n\n\u201cKurds are not your proxy and will not be. Your days of colonization are over,\u201d he added.\n\nThe angry reaction of the Turkish presidency, however, has seemingly left Le Point unshaken. The magazine dismissed all the allegations as an attempt to impose censorship on \u201cthe countries where the press is free\u201d and vowed not to give in to Ankara\u2019s pressure.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turks appeased, Kurds saved, US gets breathing space: \u2018Russia takes on job that US failed at\u2019 in Syria\n\nIt\u2019s not the first run-in with Turkey\u2019s leader, the magazine said, mentioning another scandal involving Erdogan in May 2018, when the magazine\u2019s cover featured his photo with the caption: \u201cThe Dictator.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the magazine was also criticized by the Turkish president, while the posters featuring the cover were vandalized by his supporters in France. The editorial board also received direct death threats, according to Le Point.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
