REUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\nBarcelona\u2019s airport, Spain\u2019s second largest, was the focal point of the protests, with thousands of people gathering there following the jailing of nine separatist Catalan leaders by the Spanish Supreme Court. Riot police had charged at the crowd using batons and firing foam balls to hold back the protesters.\n\nJordi Munoz, a spokesman for Spanish airport operator Aena (AENA.MC) told Reuters no delays or cancellations were planned for Wednesday, and Tuesday had been largely calm.\n\n\u201cThe 45 cancelled flights today are actually a consequence of yesterday\u2019s cancellations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said most of Monday\u2019s protesters did not make it inside the terminal and that there was little infrastructural damage.\n\nLucille, a 64-year-old pensioner from France whose flight was delayed, said: \u201cNo one could leave or exit the airport. I spent the night on this [piece of cardboard], without food or water.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vending machines quickly emptied and the queues to charge phones were endless. I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d she said.\n\nMunoz said he was not able to provide an estimate of the economic impact or the number of passengers affected by the protests at this stage, as airlines had not communicated flight fill rates with airport authorities.\n\nAnother passenger Estelle, 45, said: \u201cWe saw this huge mass of policemen, and protesters, especially all along the highway - I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nShe also said she supported the Catalans\u2019 right to protest as \u201cpart of democracy.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of travellers were stranded at Barcelona's El Prat airport on Tuesday when 45 flights were cancelled in addition to more than a hundred grounded on Monday due to protests by Catalan independence supporters, the airport authority said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441169869&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1HH", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
