Change is also a constant thread throughout our past and present at Coca-Cola. However, this year we are also reflecting on consistency, durability and our long-standing commitment to Europe.\n\nIt is 100 years since our first European bottling plants began production in France in 1919. While some enterprising drinkers managed to enjoy imported crates of Coca-Cola since the turn of the century, it was the juddering and clinking of the first two bottling lines in Paris and Bordeaux that began the business we know today. The ambitions of those early entrepreneurs set the foundation for a business that has been continually investing in Europe ever since. A truly European business that today produces every drink we sell locally.\n\nThroughout the last century our commitment to Europe has remained undiminished. Today, Europe matters more than ever. Our European business makes a substantial contribution to our company on a global scale. European society also leads the way in addressing critical topics such as health and wellbeing, environmental sustainability and innovation that we strive to echo elsewhere.\n\nA truly European business that today produces every drink we sell locally.\n\nTogether with Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic and other bottlers, we now operate 75 bottling plants across 24 EU member countries. Those first few employees we welcomed in 1919 have since grown to more than 39,000 direct Coca-Cola jobs supported today. And that first Coca-Cola bottle \u2014 available in just one size \u2014 is still available alongside 800 different drinks served across Europe each day.\n\nOf course, this didn\u2019t happen overnight, and we\u2019ve learnt much along the way. As Europe has changed and reacted to societal challenges, so has our business. The centenary milestone led me to consider some of the core principles that continue to define how we do things and remain as true today as when we began producing in Europe 100 years ago.\n\nWhile our centenary gives a brief opportunity to reflect on what has gone before, we are much more focused on preparing for the future. Those early entrepreneurs saw great promise in Europe a century ago and made a commitment to the continent which we carry forward today. While we live in ever-changing and dynamic times, I can say with great certainty that we will continue supporting European societies in one year, 10 years and 100 years by maintaining our truly local business. The impact of the actions and endeavors we put in place today as companies, industries and societies can be profound for generations to come.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Tim Brett, president of Coca-Cola Western Europe, reflects on\u202fa century of\u202flocal production\u202fin Europe\u202fand\u202fCoca-Cola\u2019s\u202fcommitment\u202fto\u202fdoing business the right way, not just the easy way.", "authors": ["Tim Brett", "President Of Coca-Cola Western Europe"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CocaCola-cafe-archive-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
