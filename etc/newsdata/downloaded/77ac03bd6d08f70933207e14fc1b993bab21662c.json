(Tyler Kaufman/AP)\n\nJoe Burrow had seemingly led the LSU offense into a new era, one long promised but never fully delivered.\n\nHe had tied a program record with five touchdown passes during Saturday\u2019s season-opening win against Georgia Southern, needing just the first half to do so. The normally grinding Tigers romped, 55-3, the most points they had scored in a season opener since 2000 and their most in a regulation game since 2015.\n\nBut the senior\u2019s reaction to the performance revealed as much about LSU\u2019s commitment to transforming its offense as did the statistics.\n\n\u201cWe still left some points on the field,\u201d Burrow said Tuesday. \u201cSo we\u2019re working to correct that.\u201d\n\nA far more demanding test for No. 6 LSU comes Saturday night at No. 9 Texas, but it appears the Tigers are ready to fully open things up.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Burrow said of moving full time to a no-huddle spread formation, crediting offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger and passing game coordinator Joe Brady. \u201cI have a lot of freedom within the offense to do the things that I want to do. Coach E and Coach Joe do a great job of listening to my inputs and actually implementing them. A lot of coaches will listen and kind of toss it to the wayside. I\u2019ll come with an idea, and you\u2019ll see it in the game plan the next day, so that fires me up.\u201d\n\n[John Feinstein: Michigan vs. Army is a guarantee game \u2014 it guarantees worry for both coaches]\n\nAs has the addition of Brady, 29, who had spent the past two seasons as an offensive assistant with the New Orleans Saints. LSU Coach Ed Orgeron has called Brady a \u201cgame changer\u201d on the offensive staff for his expertise in the run-pass option and play designs that get the ball to running backs and tight ends. In the season opener, 14 Tigers caught passes, including five running backs, to bring an element of the Saints\u2019 prolific passing game led by quarterback Drew Brees and Coach Sean Payton, for whom Orgeron worked as defensive line coach in 2008.\n\nBrady\u2019s contributions come a season after Ensminger started Burrow on the path to directing the spread. Last year Burrow, who played two seasons as a backup at Ohio State, became the first quarterback in LSU history to pass for 2,500 yards while also rushing for more than 350. His 3,293 yards of total offense ranked second in program history. He capped his junior campaign by throwing for 394 yards and four touchdowns in a 40-32 Fiesta Bowl win over Central Florida during which LSU lined up in the spread more than it had in any other game.\n\nStill, there was skepticism entering this season that the Tigers would rely less on the running game, a program signature established in 11-plus seasons under Orgeron\u2019s predecessor, Les Miles. In 2018, LSU still ran 176 more times than it threw. Burrow\u2019s completion percentage of 57.8 ranked 79th in the Football Bowl Subdivision, he completed 20 or more passes just three times (the final three games), and he threw 16 touchdown passes all season.\n\nFast forward to the 2019 opener, when he completed 23 of 27 passes for 278 yards and those five touchdowns, two more than in his first four games of 2018 combined.\n\n\u201cNight and day, night and day,\u201d Orgeron said of Burrow\u2019s development. \u201cConfident. He was on the money [last week]. Very well prepared. The lookovers at the line of scrimmage, he knew where to go. It makes you have a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nBurrow was not sacked against Georgia Southern, and that protection allowed the Tigers to flourish with a balanced attack, passing 39 times and running 33. That ratio is a far cry from the LSU offenses of the past 15 years that came nowhere close to a 50-50 split between run and pass plays.\n\n\u201cI do believe we have the skill and the knowledge to get people open, to catch the football and make yards after the catch,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cBut we do have to protect the quarterback first.\u201d\n\nOrgeron\u2019s decision to embrace the spread offense evolved in fits and starts since he took over for Miles on an interim basis following the first four games of 2016. The Tigers\u2019 predictable run-first offense had sputtered, scoring just nine touchdowns in those four games and averaging 339.5 yards. Oregon elevated Ensminger from tight ends coach to offensive coordinator and play-caller, and over the final eight games LSU averaged 465 yards and 32 points, scoring 38 or more five times. Still, Orgeron went outside the program to hire Matt Canada as offensive coordinator before the 2017 season. Canada\u2019s tenure lasted only one year, and Orgeron reinstalled Ensminger as coordinator before last season.\n\nThe full-time transition to the spread already has accrued dividends beyond a less predictable offense or elevated yards and points totals. There has been an uptick in interest from high school players as well, Orgeron said. LSU recruits heavily in Texas, and Orgeron emphasized that the offensive performance this weekend in Austin could affect future classes.\n\n\u201cThey want to see us throwing the football,\u201d he said of recruits. \u201cThey want to see us in the shotgun. The quarterbacks love seeing it. The playmakers love getting the ball in their hand. The running backs love it. Offensive linemen love it. They love seeing you score points.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLiberty Coach Hugh Freeze won\u2019t be lying down on the job anymore\n\nOhio State vs. Cincinnati marks a crossroads, with a connection in New Hampshire\n\nYour college football team rolled in its opener.
