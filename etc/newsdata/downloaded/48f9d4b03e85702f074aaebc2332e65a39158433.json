Its retail partners include Amazon, eBay, ASOS, The Iconic, Surfstitch, Adidas and Groupon.\n\nParcelpoint's network is still dwarfed by that of Australia Post, which owns or franchises 4300 post offices, as well as 15,000 street posting boxes, according to a spokesman.\n\nThe behemoth is also taking on Parcelpoint in the convenience stakes, with a network of 350 parcel lockers enabling round-the-clock pick-ups and deliveries.\n\n\"We're working actively with partners to extend that network,\" the Australia Post spokesman said, adding it now offered its own end-to-end order fulfilment service to e-tailers via internal start-up, Fulfilio.\n\nWhile admitting that parcel lockers were an ideal solution for some, Mr Leach pointed out a greater variety of package shapes and sizes could be handled over the counter, Parcelpoint locations also held packages for up to 14 days, versus a 48-hour window for the lockers.\n\nUsing what Mr Leach calls a \"zero assets model\", Parcelpoint contracts out all its courier work \u2013 including, ironically, to Australia Post \u2013 but runs the software which joins e-tailer to pick-up point to customer.\n\nAggregating several deliveries in an area to one location created savings over doorstep deliveries that e-tailers could either pass on to customers or pocket themselves, Mr Leach said.\n\nFewer vehicle miles is also good for the environment, a selling point Mr Leach is about to amplify with the addition of Parcelpoint-branded electric vehicles to its delivery fleet, funded by this latest capital raising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, he said Parcelpoint was a solution to dwindling foot traffic for bricks-and-mortar retailers, claiming 34 per cent of Parcelpoint users buy something while they are in store.\n\nThe shop also gets a commission for every package it holds, with Parcelpoint taking them away if unclaimed after two weeks.\n\nMr Leach would not reveal Parcelpoint's revenue run rate, but said delivery volumes were up 314 per cent year-on-year, with the unique user count growing from 1 million to 1.2 million in the last six months.\n\nThe just-completed $4.5 million capital raise was in the form of convertible notes, so did not indicate a new valuation for Parcelpoint. It was valued at $22.5 million by a March 2018 equity raise.\n\nListed courier companies Federal Express and UPS currently trade at enterprise-value-to-revenue ratios of 0.85 times and 1.5 times respectively, although these are long-established businesses not directly comparable to a start-up in growth phase.", "description": "Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, and the founder of Aussie Home Loans have doubled down their support for Sydney start-up Parcelpoint in a fresh $4.5m funding round.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.218%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_29/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b61302c44656a934a9fdccf7d184f95e7d05a90e", "published_at": "2019-06-20"}
