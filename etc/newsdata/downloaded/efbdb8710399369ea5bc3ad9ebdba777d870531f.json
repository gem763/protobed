(AP) - The Seattle Seahawks will induct late owner Paul Allen into the club\u2019s Ring of Honor before Thursday\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nAllen purchased the Seahawks in 1997 and helped keep the team in Seattle after former owner Ken Behring attempted to move them to Southern California. He owned the franchise until his death last year from non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nJody Allen, Allen\u2019s sister, became the controlling owner and chair of the franchise. She says the induction \u201ccelebrates Paul\u2019s legacy and the impact he made on not only the Seahawks organization, but the entire Pacific Northwest.\u201d\n\nAllen will become the 12th member of the Ring of Honor. The group already includes Hall of Famers WR Steve Largent, DT Cortez Kennedy, OL Walter Jones, and former stars QB Jim Zorn, CB Dave Brown, RB Curt Warner, DE Jacob Green, QB Dave Krieg, coach Chuck Knox and broadcaster Pete Gross.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks will induct late owner Paul Allen into the club's Ring of Honor before Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Rams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
