I think as women self love and confidence is something we should embrace and take ownership of.\n\n\"I want to encourage women to feel confident about themselves and have the courage to stand up for what they want, so Ann Summers is the perfect partner to help me spread this empowering message and unite us girls together!\u201d\n\nSomeone who will probably appreciate these photos is Maura's boyfriend, Curtis Pritchard, who she met in the Love Island villa.\n\nHe attended the Pride of Britain Awards last night, revealing he had been to watch Maura for her upcoming Dancing On Ice appearance.\n\nI went and watched her once\" he said.\n\n\"But i\u2019m a dancer, not on ice. I won\u2019t comment on [gestures to waist] and below\n\nMaura was so busy training for the show, which will kick off early next year, she wasn't in attendance for the awards.\n\n(Image: The Mirror/ Prode of Britian)\n\n(Image: Brett D.
