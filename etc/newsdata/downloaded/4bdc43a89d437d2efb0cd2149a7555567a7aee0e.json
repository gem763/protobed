She really is my little miracle.\n\n'When they pulled her out, the IUD was tucked under her armpit. I remember them holding it up and showing me.\n\n'Fortunately it didn't do her any harm, but she was so thin and fragile, it could have very easily cut her.'\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, IUDs are 'more than 99 per cent effective' and are considered to be one of the 'best birth control methods' available to women.\n\nThe organization states that 'fewer than one out of 100 people who use an IUD will get pregnant each year', thanks in large part to the fact that the device doesn't require any daily action from the user - like a pill, which can be forgotten, or a condom, which can be used incorrectly.\n\nSo it came as a great shock to Evelynn to discover that she had managed to conceive after getting the IUD - which doctors could not remove from her swollen cervix during pregnancy in case it caused her to miscarry. The expectant mother says she was incredibly worried the IUD would harm her unborn baby.\n\nDespite having the contraceptive device fitted after the birth of her fifth child in 2016, Evelynn started to have cramps, and soon after took a pregnancy test that came up positive\n\nIn June, Ava was born naturally, weighing a fifth of the average newborn's weight and 13 inches long, and she was quickly rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit\n\nWhen her waters broke just 23 weeks into the pregnancy, the anxious mother was rushed to a specialist clinic where she was kept on bed rest for a week as doctors tried to stop her early labor.\n\nWhat is a contraceptive coil? There are two types of contraceptive coil, an IUD and an IUS. An IUD is a small, T-shaped plastic and copper device that's put into your uterus. It releases copper to stop you getting pregnant and protects against pregnancy for between 5 and 10 years. An IUS is a hormonal coil that is also placed into your uterus. It releases progestogen to stop you getting pregnant, and protects you from pregnancy for between 3 to 5 years. There are two brands of hormonal coil used in the UK, Mirena and Jaydess.

She was quickly rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nJust days after being born, Ava had to undergo heart surgery to repair the missing skin between her arteries, which were causing her lungs to fill with blood.\n\nDespite progressing well, Ava remains in hospital where she is on oxygen and being tube fed, with Evelynn admitting that she can't 'wait to bring her home'.\n\nSpeaking on her GoFundMe page, Evelynn said: 'Ava is doing pretty good. Her surgery went really well.\n\n'The only complication is that she has developed a heart murmur from the surgery but they don't expect it to last, and even if it does many people live just fine with one.\n\n'This is the last machine she will be on before being off the oxygen completely and she will be on it for a couple of weeks'.", "description": "Evelynn Crouse, 26, from\u00a0Titusville, Florida, unexpectedly fell pregnant with her sixth child while she was on the IUD and has revealed how her little girl was born with the device under her armpit.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/12/19293972-0-image-a-22_1570187064979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
