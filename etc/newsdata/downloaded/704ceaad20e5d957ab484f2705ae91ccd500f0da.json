But many of those involved in controlling relationships are also victims of sexual abuse.\n\nDespite the government keeping domestic violence funding and sexual violence funding generally separate, there\u2019s a very blurry line between the two. The statistics are certainly similar \u2013 roughly one in four women experiences domestic violence, while around one in five women will encounter sexual violence in adulthood \u2013 and it would be naive to assume these are never the same women. In abusive relationships, the abuser will often force or coerce their victim into sex after a physical attack \u2013 manipulation often dressed as an \u201capology\u201d. Both are acts of power, humiliation and dominance.\n\nVolunteering at Peterborough Rape Crisis Centre, I\u2019ve been shocked at how difficult it is to raise funds for sexual violence \u2013 we aren\u2019t even allowed a coin token slot at the local supermarket, because of squeamishness over the word \u201crape\u201d \u2013 while I\u2019ve seen many local workplaces collecting for domestic violence. And this distinction can be a truly damaging one for survivors. The implication is that survivors of sexual violence are somehow to blame in a way that those who have been abused in other ways are not.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

While domestic abuse conviction rates have been reported this week as rising in Wales (78 per cent in 2017-18) sexual violence convictions in England and Wales have fallen to a five-year low, with only 37 per cent of cases sent to the CPS in April to September last year.\n\nThis is obviously a worrying message to present survivors of sexual violence. I know many who would never go to the police in the first place, for fear of not being believed, or being questioned on their phone records, past relationships and other irrelevant victim-blaming details. And that\u2019s without mentioning those who have plucked up the courage to go to the police and had their charges dropped, despite giving harrowing evidence. When survivors of sexual violence see that the chances of a conviction are so low, it\u2019s understandable that many just can\u2019t face the process.\n\nIn setting up my website Survivor Stories, I\u2019ve spoken to various women who have sought help for emotional and physical abuse long before they\u2019ve ever thought to heal the wounds of sexual violence. One told me she went to Women\u2019s Aid after leaving her abusive partner, but felt conflicted about seeking counselling at the rape crisis centre. She told me she worried about \u201ctaking the space of a woman who had been raped by a stranger\u201d. And this is why it matters how we talk to survivors of any type of violence.\n\nWhile society \u2013 and the media \u2013 continue to think of rape as a one-off act of violence by a stranger in an alley, and continue to use victim-blaming language, women who have been systematically raped and abused by their partners feel unworthy of help.\n\nIt\u2019s those abusers, of course, who are more aware of this stigma than anyone. It\u2019s one of the tools in their arsenal to make these women stay with them \u2013 \u201cno one will believe you\u201d. Or, \u201cyou wanted this\u201d.\n\nWhy are people more comfortable with helping survivors of certain types of abuse, when it all stems from the same behaviour? We need to get better at listening to survivors with different experiences, and talking about rape. Only then can we help empower them to seek help, no matter what form their abuse has taken.", "description": "When you ask most people to describe what they think of as \u201cdomestic violence\u201d the answers will probably involve kicking, punching or screaming.
