He never emerged.\n\nDuring the ceremony, activists called for a comprehensive United Nations investigation into the murder and action to ensure that the perpetrators of the killing don't go unpunished.\n\nBezos, who is also the founder of Amazon, praised Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who paced a street outside the Saudi consulate for hours waiting for him to re-emerge.\n\n\"No one should ever have to endure what you did,\" Bezos said. \"You need to know that you are in our hearts. We are here and you are not alone.\"\n\nParticipants later unveiled a memorial for Khashoggi, who had become a sharp critic of the Saudi kingdom.\n\nSeveral questions linger a year since his killing, including the whereabouts of his body and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's possible culpability.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it is trying 11 people for the killing, but few details about the case have been released.\n\nPrince Mohammed meanwhile, said in an interview this week he takes full responsibility for the killing but denied he ordered it.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
