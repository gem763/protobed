We barely slept. We would take breaks off for fast food and go back to work until three in the morning,\" Allen says in an audio clip used in the documentary. (Allen passed away from cancer in 2018.)\n\nAllen and Gates launched Microsoft in 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1979, the company moved to Bellevue, Washington and in 1986, Microsoft moved to Redmond, Washington, where it is currently headquartered.\n\n\"We were hardcore about hey, if you are working on a piece of code, then just get it done, don't worry about sleep,\" Gates says. \"Back then, some amount of adrenaline or something.\"", "description": "During Microsoft's early years, Gates was sometimes too focused to stop for meals, so he licked orange Tang (the powered drink mix NASA famously used in space) off his fingers for energy. \"I loved being fanatic. Eventually I reveled in it. I didn't believe in weekends, I didn't believe in vacation,\" Gates says in Netflix's documentary series, \"Inside Bill's Brain.\"", "authors": ["Catherine Clifford"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141165-1568995403371preview.jpg?v=1568995419", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
