He won\u2019t go on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list because no criminal charges have been filed. Brown has denied the allegations by his former trainer.\n\nPlayers on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list can\u2019t play in games or practice with a team, but are still paid. The Patriots play at Miami on Sunday.\n\nThe wide receiver was acquired in a trade with Oakland this month after requesting and receiving his release from the Raiders.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two people with direct knowledge of the decision, say Antonio Brown will be eligible to play for the New England Patriots.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/patriots_antonio_brown_lawsuit_football_18647_c0-189-4500-2812_s1770x1032.jpg?33271a9210e0d700b8e28e38f38178c03fe32ed4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
