Netflix, Disney, AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal each threatened boycotts while other media giants also considered such moves.

None have taken effect. Federal judges have blocked the policies in Ohio, Mississippi, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah, and legal challenges are pending in the other states.
