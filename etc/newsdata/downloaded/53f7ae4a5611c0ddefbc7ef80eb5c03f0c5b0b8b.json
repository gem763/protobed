The 40.7 percent approval sits higher than in five other quarters with Trump's low hitting 36.8 percent in his fourth quarter in office.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 42.7 percent in the 10th quarter had served as Trump's highest in the Gallup poll since taking office. Gallup notes that 6 percentage-point difference between Trump's highest approval and lowest approval is a relatively small gap.\n\nBy comparison, the nine other post-World War II presidents elected to their first term had an average difference of 21 percentage points between their highest and lowest approval averages in their first 11 quarters in office, according to the polling service.\n\nGallup attributes Trump\u2019s trend to the highly polarized nature of his approval ratings \u2014 which according to Gallup has been consistently high among Republicans and low among Democrats \u2014 as one possible cause of the stability in approval ratings across quarters.\n\nDespite little change in Trump\u2019s approval rating, his 11th quarter in office has been fairly eventful.\n\nThe quarter was marked in September by an impeachment inquiry launched by the House into the president.
