Von der Leyen said hers would be \u201cgeopolitical\u201d, implying that the EU should play a greater role in world affairs.\n\nVESTAGER KEEPS ANTITRUST ROLE\n\nAnnouncing the key roles in her line-up, she said Denmark\u2019s Margrethe Vestager would remain in charge of competition policy and Irishman Phil Hogan would take on trade.\n\nVon der Leyen will become the first woman to head the European Commission after promising a platform of a greener, fairer and rule-based Europe.\n\nHer proposed team offers rough gender balance, a plus point for EU lawmakers, with 13 women and 14 men.\n\nEuropean Commission's president-designate Ursula von der Leyen speaks during a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\n\u201cWe will take bold action against climate change, build our partnership with the United States, define our relations with a more self-assertive China and be a reliable neighbour, for example to Africa,\u201d she said.\n\nThe European Union would be the \u201cguardian of multilateralism\u201d, she said, recognising that some tasks could not be achieved by Europe alone.\n\nThe bloc should be a bigger player in artificial intelligence and big data and improve its defence against cyber attacks.\n\nHolding the influential competition portfolio for the past five years, Vestager has fought monopolies and imposed hefty fines on tech giants Apple (AAPL.O) and Alphabet unit Google (GOOGL.O).\n\nCompetition is seen as a top job, with Germany and France pressing for the bloc to soften its anti-monopoly rules to help European industrial champions compete with rivals from China and the United States.\n\nHogan, currently in charge of agriculture, will face a battle to resolve trade tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and will be in charge of establishing future economic relations with Britain after Brexit.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe economic portfolio goes to former Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at a time when the continent is struggling with weak growth, a possible recession in Germany, and battles with Italy over budgetary restraint.\n\nThe outgoing commission has long tussled with Italy over fiscal rules in past years. The appointment of an Italian leftist to monitor Rome\u2019s compliance with EU budget rules could be seen as a lenient move.\n\nHowever, Gentiloni will have to agree budget decisions with former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, who has a reputation as a tough enforcer of fiscal discipline and will be in charge overall of the Commission\u2019s economic affairs.\n\nIn a sign of change from the current executive, the Commission will create a new defence and space arm, under internal markets commissioner Sylvie Goulard, an ally of French President Emmanuel Macron.", "description": "The European Union must lead the fight against climate change, build ties with the United States and Africa and face up to a more assertive China, the incoming chief of the EU executive said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Philip Blenkinsop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428298489&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890S6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
