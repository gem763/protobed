In addition, the hooker Schalk Brits, spent nine years at Saracens, the club that supplies half of England\u2019s pack.\n\nCheslin Kolbe back in contention for South Africa in World Cup final Read more\n\nLouw, who won the vital penalty that gave South Africa the position to overcome Wales five minutes from time in Sunday\u2019s semi-final, will next week return to Bath for his ninth season at the club. He remembers Underhill joining from Ospreys in the summer of 2017.\n\n\u201cMy first impression of Sam was that he was a quiet, softly spoken guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe loves a beer, and I have joined him for many of those. He has developed massively as a player in two years and the way he has refined elements of his game came through last weekend, especially in defence.\n\n\u201cHe has the ability to stop momentum in the tackle and he packs presence at the breakdown where he poaches the ball. He is discovering what rugby is about and that there are so many different ways to play the game. Being the young guy he is, he gets exposed to different concepts and strategies and varied players around him.\n\n\u201cHe has adapted and he has a massive hunger to learn and grow as a player. That is one of the ultimate traits of a professional, the burning desire to better yourself continuously and he has been rightly rewarded by being given England\u2019s seven shirt.\u201d\n\nCurry and Underhill, whose three appearances in the Six Nations have all been as a replacement, did not start a match together until August this year when Ireland were beaten 57-15 at Twickenham. Billy Vunipola was the No 8 then and the trio have taken the field in all England\u2019s five matches here.\n\nThe South Africa head coach Rassie Erasmus said that while the feedback from his Premiership seven was valuable, it also worked in reverse and Curry will have given an insight into De Klerk, the Springboks\u2019 tactical inspiration who likes to wind up opponents.\n\n\u201cTom has been amazing for England this year,\u201d said the Springbok scrum-half. \u201cI do not think he has missed a minute. He is always willing to work hard and he is up there with most of his stats. I know him pretty well and I have some stuff on him I can share with the group, which is a bit of a positive.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nDe Klerk reignited his international career after joining Sale. \u201cYour understanding of the game changes because conditions in England mean the game is a lot more tactical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a scrum-half, that means being able to adjust, knowing when to attack and when to kick. I was not surprised at how England played against New Zealand or that they had the better of them tactically.\u201d\n\nLouw has been used from the bench with South Africa\u2019s captain, Siya Kolisi, occupying his position. \u201cSiya plays with great courage and leads by example,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a lot of weight on his shoulders with regards to the make-up of our nation, where we have come from and where we are now. He is self-aware, knowing his strengths and weaknesses, and that is what you want in a leader.\n\n\u201cIt will be an immense battle on Saturday. We are at the final stage of the ultimate competition in our game. Both groups of players will have to dig really deep and front up, but afterwards I will have a good time with my five Bath colleagues who are in the England squad.\u201d", "description": "South Africa are using the experience seven of their squad have of playing in the Premiership to their advantage ahead of Saturday\u2019s World Cup final against England", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b3b0ed5eceeb892cbe6a99abf48545459d6a0b/0_151_5153_3091/master/5153.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1865c3330caaea8081b8781bca6a174", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
