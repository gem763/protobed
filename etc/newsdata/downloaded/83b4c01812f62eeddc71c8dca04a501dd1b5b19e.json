Trysta Krick recaps it all and looks ahead to the epic finale. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 In this marvelous and historic season, the Washington Nationals knew all along Tuesday it had to end this way.\n\nTheir magical year simply could not possibly conclude in any other fashion.\n\n\u201cThis is most 2019 Nats thing ever,\" Washington closer Sean Doolittle said, \u201cfor our season to come down to Game 7 of the World Series.\"\n\nThat day has arrived.\n\nThe Nationals, who knocked off the Houston Astros at home, 7-2, winning their fourth elimination game of the postseason, forced Game 7 on Wednesday night at Minute Maid Park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of dry rehearsals,\" Doolittle said, \u201cnow the real thing is here.\"\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that the man on the mound for the Nationals is none other than three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer, who\u2019ll be facing Zack Greinke, the first Game 7 matchup between former Cy Young winners in World Series history.\n\nTwo days ago, Scherzer couldn\u2019t get out of bed or dress himself because of neck and back spasms.\n\nNow, he will be pitching the biggest game in franchise history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got him wrapped in bubble wrap,\" said Nats outfielder Adam Eaton, who homered in the fifth inning. \u201cWe told him, 'Stay away from sharp objects and corners in the wall. Don\u2019t dance. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t do anything. Get in a neck brace.\n\n\"We\u2019re all kind of feeding him lines, trying to protect him and get him ready.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty dramatic. He\u2019s writing his own script now. There will be people trying to write books right after this.\"\n\nWell, at the least, getting the same kind of cortisone shot Scherzer received Sunday, the day he was scratched from Game 5, and now is magically cured.\n\nScherzer flew to Houston with his teammates Monday in a neck brace, showed up early to the ballpark Tuesday and threw in the outfield. He stayed in the bullpen during the game, and even warmed, preparing to enter the game before Anthony Rendon\u2019s two-run homer in the seventh gave the Nats a 5-2 lead.\n\n\u201cI think it was really good for him to feel some of that energy that was in the building tonight,\" Doolittle said. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you test it before batting practice when there\u2019s really no adrenaline at all. So, for him to have that heightened energy level, and to see how it felt, more so mentally than anything else, was a big box to check off.\"\n\nAnd just in case anyone had any illusions that it would be anyone but Scherzer pitching, he announced himself that he\u2019d be starting Game 7, and will be on the mound until Dave Martinez pries that ball from his hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Game 7, let\u2019s go,\" Scherzer shouted. \u201cEverybody had the belief in me, and the doctors and that if I could get right I can be ready for Game 7.\n\n\u201cThis is what you live for.\n\n\"I\u2019m good to go.\"\n\nSERIES TIED: Strasburg's stellar outing sets up dramatic Game 7\n\nYOU'RE OUT: Controversial call gets manager ejected in Game 6\n\nIt\u2019s unknown just how long Scherzer will be able to last. His routine is completely off-kilter. And although he wasn\u2019t throwing his hardest while warming up in the bullpen, he was throwing as if he were going to enter the game.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see myself telling Max, you\u2019re only going to go 75 pitches,\" Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to want to go out there and go as long as he can.\n\n\u201cMax will pitch until his neck decides he can\u2019t pitch anymore.\"\n\nThen again, considering Scherzer\u2019s personality, he may have to hurt Martinez\u2019s own neck if he dares come to the mound too early.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so pumped,\" Nats second baseman Brian Dozier said. \u201cHe had his mind set that he was going to go. Even if he was in a lot of pain, he\u2019d still be going.\n\n\u201cWe got the best pitcher in the league going Game 7, I like our chances.\"\n\nScherzer on the field before Game 6 on Tuesday. (Photo: Tim Warner, Getty Images)\n\nThis, after all, is Mad Max.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor, he\u2019s a warrior,\" Doolittle said. \u201cWe like to use all of the macho metaphors. He\u2019s really tough. I mean, he pitched with a broken nose after taking a ball off his face this year.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing that was going to keep him out of Game 7.\"\n\nKurt Suzuki, Scherzer\u2019s personal catcher who has been out since Game 3 with a hip flexor issue, said he\u2019ll be back too. He and Scherzer had their own pep talk before the game, with Suzuki vowing to Scherzer that if he could pitch Game 7, he\u2019d be there catching him.\n\n\u201cNobody really doubted he\u2019d be back,\" Suzuki said. \u201cHe\u2019s rising from the dead. I told him, 'You go out there, I think I can manage one more for you. Let\u2019s see how long it can last, but I\u2019m going out there.'\n\n\u201cShoot, it\u2019s the World Series. How many chances you get to play in the World Series, let alone Game 7?\"\n\nBesides, when your own manager charges onto the field ready to take on the entire umpiring crew, how can you not be pumped to take the ball?\n\n\u201cMan, when your manager comes out and does that, after having a heart procedure a month-and-a-half ago, that fires you up,\" Doolittle said.\n\nNow, after eight months of baseball, it\u2019s only fitting that it comes down to one final game in a series where the visiting team has won the first six games for the first time in World Series history.\n\n\u201cThis is what you live for, it\u2019s what you dream of,\" Nats first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s here.\n\n\u201cPretty special.\"\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Max Scherzer is set to take the mound in the winner-take-all Game 7 on Wednesday, just three days after being scratched from Game 5 due to neck pain.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
