The scene looks like something out of a science-fiction film:\n\n#ROSETTA ??

So in the foreground, sunlit specks of ice and dust float near a cliff that stands thousands of feet tall.\n\nCosmic rays also hit Rosetta's camera sensor, causing white streaks in the series of black-and-white images.\n\nIn addition to photographing Comet 67P, Rosetta also set down a probe called Philae on the comet's surface \u2014 though the lander rolled into a shady crevice and was never heard from again.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, the ESA purposefully crashed Rosetta into the wad of ice, rock, and dust. The robot took a final and fateful sequence of images along the way.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp message every morning with all our latest news: Sign up here.\n\nNow read: MaXhosa by Laduma is taking legal action against Zara over \u2018copy-cat design\u2019\n\nSee also:", "description": "A new timelapse movie of photos taken by the Rosetta spacecraft show Comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko tumbling through space amid a flurry of dust and stars.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7312/46bd2865ed6141aca79a6146703ce763.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-24"}
