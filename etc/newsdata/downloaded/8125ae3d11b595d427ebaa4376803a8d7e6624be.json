This means holding @PHEAAaid accountable for #PSLF breakdowns that are ruining the lives of countless nurses, teachers, police and other public servants. https://t.co/zP2riF2f9N \u2014 Student Borrower Protection Center (@theSBPC) October 29, 2019\n\nPHEAA \u2015 a quasi-governmental agency that does business as FedLoan \u2015 is the sole servicer of the PSLF program, which was established in 2007 and was meant to forgive the remainder of public service workers\u2019 federal student loan debt after they make 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nPHEAA, however, has been accused of grossly mismanaging the program, leading to the denial of loan forgiveness for the vast majority of applicants \u2014 even eligible ones.\n\nThe New York Times, citing data from the Education Department, said in July that the program was a \u201cspectacular failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the 18 months after borrowers with a decade of service in government or nonprofit jobs first became eligible [for the program] in 2017, 73,554 people applied to have their student loans wiped out. And 73,036 were turned down \u2014 a rejection rate of 99.3 percent,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nAs the senators\u2019 letter pointed out this week, government watchdogs have repeatedly called out the PHEAA\u2019s mismanagement of the program over the years. Yet, the senators wrote, \u201cthe CFPB has refused to exercise its authority to conduct supervisory examinations of PHEAA\u2019s servicing practices and its management of the PSLF program.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly pressed the CFPB to conduct this critical oversight, but you have provided nothing but excuses for the CFPB\u2019s inaction,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nNew York and Massachusetts have separately sued PHEAA for its failure to adequately service the PSLF program.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said in her complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court earlier this month, that \u201cPHEAA\u2019s abuses have not only denied these dedicated public servants the benefits they have earned, but have undermined the goals of the loan forgiveness program.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for PHEAA told the Times that the allegations in the New York suit were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d", "description": "Lawmakers demanded that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate a loan forgiveness program for teachers and other public service workers.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db952c52100002f3834b6f4.jpeg?cache=kyzj8m2wbk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
