The event\u2019s website says 50,000 attendees have registered online for the event at the NRG Stadium. The White House said the event would provide an opportunity to strengthen ties and discuss energy and trade relationships.\n\nFrom there, Mr. Trump will travel to Wapakoneta, Ohio, to visit an Australian-owned manufacturing facility where he will be joined by Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison.\n\nThe trip will come after Mr. Trump hosts Mr. Morrison in Washington for an official state visit later this week, including a state dinner, the second since Mr. Trump arrived at the White House. Mr. Morrison became prime minister in May after Australia\u2019s conservative government eked out a surprise victory.\n\nMessrs. Trump and Modi met most recently at the Group of Seven meeting in France last month, where they were asked by reporters about the president\u2019s offer to help mediate the clash with Pakistan over Mr. Modi\u2019s decision to revoke Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. But Mr. Modi described the issues as \u201cbilateral,\u201d and Mr. Trump said that the \u201cprime minister really feels he has it under control.\u201d\n\nTensions over trade have escalated between India and the U.S. in recent months. India raised tariffs on some goods imported by the U.S. earlier this summer, in an apparent response to a U.S. move to remove some special trade benefits that India had enjoyed.\n\nMr. Trump also met with Mr. Morrison at the G-7 summit. In a statement at the time, the White House said they discussed diplomatic and security concerns and pledged to deepen their relationship.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump will travel to Texas next weekend to attend an event with India\u2019s prime minister and then will visit Ohio with Australia\u2019s leader.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107315/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
