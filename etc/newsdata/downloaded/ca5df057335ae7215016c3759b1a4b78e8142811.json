Photo: Richard Termine\n\nThe Brazilian play What If They Went to Moscow? is actually also a movie. It is also sort of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters, a soulful portrait of women in extremis, and a description of our shared modern malaise. Conceiver-director-editor Christiane Jatahy has room to cram in all this abundance: In a single evening, she\u2019s essentially built two productions in two spaces and two media. Fascinated by the relationship between theater and cinema, Jatahy has made a show that\u2019s both. \u201cOne is the utopia of the other,\u201d she tells us, though anyone who has ever despaired at badly shot video in the theater might wonder if screen and stage are actually enemies. But Jatahy has managed a strange and difficult trick. By precisely setting live film and live performance against each other, she makes them into a mise-en-abyme\u2014a mirror that reflects another mirror, leading the eye into infinity.\n\nThe audience, too, is split in half. One portion goes to the BAM Fisher Theater, where it watches a loose 90-minute adaptation of Chekhov\u2019s classic. Despite major updates\u2014birthday girl Irina (Julia Bernat) wants to go to Moscow because she loves Pussy Riot\u2014Jatahy and company have captured Chekhov\u2019s sense of a slow-moving avalanche. As in the original, the play begins with a party for Irina, hosted by oldest sister Olga (Isabel Teixera) and disrupted by dramatic middle sister Maria (Stella Rabello), who manages to cry, cheer up, and catch a new man between the doorway and the cake. Jatahy introduces another character, though: the camera. Irina films her sisters; videographers peer in through the set\u2019s walls; Maria\u2019s new lover seduces her almost entirely by pointing a camera at her\u2014we see her flower under its gaze.\n\nThese cameras record the action; Jatahy and her team then live-edit it into a video version, which the other half of the audience watches simultaneously in a nearby movie theater. (At Brooklyn Academy of Music, the BAM Rose Cinema backs up handily onto the BAM Fisher.) Halfway through the evening, the audiences trade places, and it starts all over again. We see the same 90-minute piece, but in the other medium.\n\nIn either room, the adaptation is elegant, then frightening. Most of the show is in Portuguese, but sometimes the women break into English. \u201cWho wants? Who wants?\u201d asks Olga, as she pushes snacks on the theatergoers, who have been invited to the festivities. Well, she wants terribly and painfully: A baby carriage haunts her steps, chasing her strangely across the stage. Irina certainly wants: No one will listen to her when she talks about the terrors of the current Brazilian administration, and she has started cutting herself. And Maria, poor creature, is pure, naked need. This pressure builds into explosions of music and dance, which oscillate between real action and metaphorical gestures. The sisters fling themselves into a tank of water or strip naked or grab an electric guitar. Irina screams a punk song, and poor Olga seems to pass into nightmare. At one point, she appears with mud up to her elbows. Then it\u2019s gone. What has she been digging up?\n\nAs a demonstration of technique, Moscow is superb. It\u2019s rare to find actors as compelling on a screen as in person, and yet here are three pearls. There\u2019s also something totally satisfying about the way Jatahy makes her two sections fit together; in the show\u2019s final moments, you feel the components mesh, like gears finally finding each other. But\u2014and this may be a reflection of my own tribal loyalties\u2014it\u2019s hard not to watch the show as a kind of competition between theater and film. Given the same piece in both, which medium wins?\n\nFor me, it was the theatrical iteration by a mile. Onscreen, Moscow is claustrophobic and dark-spirited, shot mostly in oppressive closeups. Onstage, we see everything against the set\u2019s backdrop of lovely honey-colored light and green hills. That softness is gone in the video version\u2014cameras are too busy zooming in to reveal the tightness in every smile, and the framing leaves no room for nature. In the cinema section, I actually caught myself remembering the magnificent in-the-flesh half with something like nostalgia.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the show\u2019s design: Jatahy wants us experiencing both a fondness for something barely over and a deliberately induced boredom. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says one of the sisters, \u201cthe past is more real than the present.\u201d That\u2019s true, and Jatahy is clever to point out that we can sometimes sour our experience retroactively. Certainly, I remember how I felt at intermission: I was staggered and delighted and in love. Somehow\u2014cleverly and painstakingly\u2014the cinema section steadily leached some of those feelings away. Was it the repetition? Or was it the screen? I watched myself grow resentful at a show I was also wholeheartedly admiring. It\u2019s hard, it turns out, to be left wanting.\n\nWhat If They Went to Moscow? is at the BAM Fisher (Fishman Space) and BAM Rose Cinemas through October 27.", "description": "Theater Review: \u2018What If They Went to Moscow?\u2019 by Christiane Jatahy at the Brooklyn Academy of Music", "authors": ["Helen Shaw"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/25-what-if-they-went-to-moscow-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
