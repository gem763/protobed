The forward trotted over and set a pick and then rolled hard to the basket as he received a nice bounce pass.\n\nTwo defenders quickly sprinted toward the forward, and he lobbed a soft pass to the center in the back of the defense for an uncontested, two-handed alley-oop slam. Within a three-second span, three players had touched the ball, resulting in a quick score.\n\nThis was an offensive play the Warriors have unleashed on the opposition throughout their reign of dominance. But on this evening, with Stephen Curry taking the night off for rest, that well-executed offensive possession featured LeBron James, Anthony Davis and JaVale McGee.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCurry could only watch from the visiting locker room at Staples Center as his team was obliterated all evening and fell 126-93. With Klay Thompson not expected to return from an ACL injury until after the All-Star break, this game punctuated how desperately the Warriors need a healthy Curry on the court as much as possible to remain a playoff hopeful.\n\nCurry will be forced to shoulder a load that is void of the offensive talent the organization featured over five consecutive years of advancing to the NBA Finals and winning three championships.\n\nAfter the game, Curry said he\u2019s up for the task and noted how the Warriors are no longer equipped to be in cruise control to start the season.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always talked about focusing on the first 20 games, but this season, it doesn\u2019t mean as we\u2019ve said before. In the past, it was focusing on the first 20 games just to break up the 82-game monotony of the season. Now, it\u2019s like the first 20 games [are] in a sense of urgency,\u201d Curry told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start off on the right foot and create a new identity and basically have fun playing basketball no matter what happens, while working through some of the unknowns. Even me trying to explain it to you, I just don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s going to look like for us on the court. And every day it's going to be fresh and new considering all the success we\u2019ve had in the past. Every day is extremely important if we\u2019re going to be a playoff team. And when we get Klay back and get to the playoffs and understand who we are, nobody is going to want to see us in the playoffs. I think that\u2019s pretty well-known.\u201d\n\nStephen Curry isn't ready to start looking up at other teams just yet. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nThe balancing act for Golden State this season will be managing Curry\u2019s workload to avoid overworking him, which could lead to injuries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll have to listen to my body,\u201d Curry told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI know how the playoffs felt last year when KD was out and having to get your rest and your recovery and being able to play at that level. But I\u2019m pretty smart around understanding exactly how I can be at my best and sustaining that over the course of the year. I\u2019m obviously not going to play 82 games, but whatever the intensity is out on the court, I\u2019ll be ready for it.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers used a starting lineup of James, Avery Bradley, Danny Green, Davis and McGee. Because of their rash of injuries, the defending Western Conference champs started D\u2019Angelo Russell, Jacob Evans, Alfonzo McKinnie, Draymond Green and Marquese Chriss.\n\nThe results were a given.\n\nJames dissected the defense with 18 points and 11 assists. Anthony Davis flirted with a triple-double, posting eight points, 10 rebounds and eight assists with two blocks. And ex-Warrior Quinn Cook led all bench scorers with 16 points.\n\nRussell had a team-high 23 points, but was minus-32.\n\nGreen was visibly frustrated numerous times about defensive breakdowns and stalling offensive sets. The Warriors now have a collection of players who have never won anything of significance and who are fighting to stay in the league, which is a major departure from years past.\n\nBut these are still the Warriors, a proud franchise that made reaching the Finals the norm. The pressure to perform at a high level is still very much present, especially while breaking in the new Chase Center in San Francisco.\n\nAnd much of that pressure will be placed upon Curry.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t confident in myself, that would really bother me,\u201d Curry told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it. And pressure isn\u2019t the right word. I feel there\u2019s an awareness of what our situation is and there\u2019s a freedom in that, too, because I can just go out there and hoop. I\u2019ve never lacked confidence. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s hard to really put into words with the teams we\u2019ve had the last couple of years from 2015 to now. I\u2019ve approached the game the exact same way, but it just looks different based on who I have out there playing with me like [Kevin Durant] and playing with Klay [Thompson]. It looks different, but my mindset is exactly the same. So, I\u2019m approaching the season the same way, which is to give my all until proven otherwise.\u201d\n\nThose within the Warriors\u2019 organization realize Golden State is no longer the league\u2019s top team. Expectations have been amended in hopes that later in the season the team might find some good footing should health work in its favor.\n\nGood health or not, Curry said his aspirations haven\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cA championship is still the goal,\u201d Curry told Yahoo Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s always been. We\u2019ve experienced it all and we\u2019re going to keep pushing to get back there. That\u2019s the goal. It\u2019s the North Star. The narrative might have changed internally, but we\u2019re still chasing the same goal.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The superstar realizes things are different now, but the ultimate goal remains the same.", "authors": ["Chris Haynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7hdk0RV2_fVch7Fga5FuhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BoKgV4P7rv3lQ_3nRlaubw--~B/aD0yODMxO3c9NDI0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f9d331b0-f0e7-11e9-a1df-01cb53493629", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
