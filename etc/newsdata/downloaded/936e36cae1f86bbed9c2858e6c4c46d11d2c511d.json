More pollsters should start doing that, as the results here are mighty interesting.\n\nNaysayers will point to the topline number and note that 42 percent is suspiciously similar to Trump\u2019s job approval in most surveys. Why, Trump-supporting Republicans have simply chosen to believe the worst about poor Joe Biden in the name of legitimizing what the president did in his call with Zelensky! But as you can see from the partisan numbers in the table, that\u2019s not true. A surprisingly large minority of GOPers, 16 percent, are skeptical about Trump\u2019s charges against Biden. And a surprisingly large number of Democrats, 19 percent, are credulous about them.\n\nAlthough maybe the Democratic numbers aren\u2019t so surprising. In the middle of a presidential primary that Biden is momentarily leading, go figure that some fans of his rivals are disposed to believe the worst about him.\n\nEither way, with 22 percent of the general public and 17 percent of Democrats undecided about Biden and Ukraine, there\u2019s plenty of room for doubt to grow about what his intentions were in leaning on them to fire the corrupt prosecutor Shokin in 2015. Trump\u2019s argument that Biden did something shady may end up with majority support before too long.\n\nWhat about impeachment, though? Monmouth looked at that too. Result:\n\nWe now have enough numbers from multiple surveys over the past few days to draw a tentative conclusion: There\u2019s no majority support for impeachment/removal yet, but support is rising and trending towards a majority. In fact, Monmouth noted in its write-up of these results that it\u2019s only the second time that support for removing Trump from office (44 percent) has exceeded his job approval (41 percent). That happened once before six months ago, around the time Mueller released the summary of his findings, but it was brief. For the moment, more people would rather see Trump ousted than are willing to say that they approve of his performance.\n\nAnother result here that replicates the findings of other polls is support for the impeachment *inquiry.* Last month the public split 41/51 on that; this month they split 49/43. Every other poll I\u2019ve seen over the past week finds at least a plurality in favor of Democrats taking a look at what went down between Trump and the Ukrainian government. That\u2019s probably because people seem to find the facts suspicious based on what they know: When asked if it\u2019s appropriate or not for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, Americans split 21/63. That\u2019s the ominous news for Trump in this data \u2014 support for impeachment could expand well into majority territory depending on how much evidence there is of Trump trying to wound Biden for his own electoral gain.\n\nOne more number for you. What\u2019s noteworthy about this result from a different poll out today?\n\nCNBC poll: Trump job approval drops six net points to 37-53, the lowest approval of his presidency in CNBC polling. pic.twitter.com/RoxMXjqGDN \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 1, 2019\n\nNo, it\u2019s not the fact that his job approval is suddenly down sharply as the impeachment news bites. It\u2019s the fact that this is the only recent poll to show that. You\u2019d expect the uproar over Ukraine and the support for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry to knock a few points off of Trump\u2019s approval rating, but it\u2019s just not happening anywhere except in the CNBC survey. The Monmouth poll finds Trump at 41 percent, *up* a point from last month. Quinnipiac\u2019s latest poll also saw his approval rise a point since its previous survey. Three different polls conducted last week had him in the 44-46 percent range, all of which is perfectly normal or even good by Trump standards. This is why I think all the navel-gazing about which party will be hurt most by impeachment is beside the point. Nothing affects people\u2019s views of Trump anymore. Probably not even impeachment. I suppose if Dems are able to prove the worst-case scenario, that he really did explicitly threaten Ukraine with the loss of military aid unless they investigated Biden for him, he might slip a bit. But barring that, he\u2019s destined to have an approval rating in the low to mid-40s on Election Day next year.
