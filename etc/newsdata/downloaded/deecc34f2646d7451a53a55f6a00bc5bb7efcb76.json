All three elements were in \u201cRandomLand,\u201d which showed Squidward opening doors to see alternate versions of himself.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFans of internet horror were stunned to see a clip from the latest episode of \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d that depicts the \u201cSquidward\u2019s Suicide\u201d meme from the classic \u201ccreepypasta\u201d of the same name.\n\nEven for those who aren\u2019t familiar with the internet urban legend, the scene from the episode that aired Saturday, \u201cSpongeBob in RandomLand,\u201d is nightmare fuel. The plot follows SpongeBob and Squidward as they explore a town that doesn\u2019t adhere to the rules of logic. At one point, a row of doors appears. Squidward starts opening doors at random to reveal alternate, creepy versions of himself.\n\nThe first alternate Squidwards have goofy, gross oversized features, and a laugh track plays behind them. But behind the third door, Squidward\u2019s bedroom from inside his Easter Island-head home appears. The screen cuts to static, and then to a terrifying depiction of Squidward with hyperrealistic red eyes and black tears. A scream is heard in the background, and Squidward slams the door.\n\nI can not believe this.

A creepypasta (a play on the meme-speak \u201ccopypasta\u201d) is an online horror legend, often involving photo and video manipulations, that gets copied and pasted in forums and on social media.\n\nCreepypastas gave rise to a few mainstream internet-culture fixtures, including \u201cSlenderman,\u201d which has since resulted in a feature film, a viral video game, and a real-life criminal case involving two 12-year-olds who stabbed their friend in hopes of summoning the fictional creature.\n\nRead more: \u2018We have our secrets\u2019: Ukraine covered for Donald Trump, and said it won\u2019t release any details of his controversial phone call about Biden\n\nThe suicidal Squidward cameo is undoubtedly based on the creepypasta. The image matches the description in the original text better than even the fan-made memes do. There are three consistent elements: Squidward\u2019s eerie black-and-white face with red eyes and black tears, his bedroom in the background, and the scream that can be heard.\n\n\u201cSquidward\u2019s Suicide\u201d has existed online since at least 2012, with YouTube videos depicting the story over the years. Its page on the Creepypasta Wiki became active again over the weekend, with comments like \u201cwe did it bois\u201d and \u201cI bet whoever wrote this is probably the happiest person alive right now.\u201d\n\nWhy the \u201cSpongeBob\u201d animators chose to incorporate the meme is unclear. The show\u2019s original target audience has grown up, but it\u2019s still predominantly marketed toward children, and the inclusion of the scary Squidward is pretty dark \u2013 especially considering its source material, which contains graphic descriptions of murdered children.\n\nNickelodeon representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to Insider\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "Business Insider - \"Squidward's Suicide\" is a viral online story known as a \"creepypasta.\" During Saturday's \"RandomLand\" episode of \"SpongeBob,\" it made a cameo..
