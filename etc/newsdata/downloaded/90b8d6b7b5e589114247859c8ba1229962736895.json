More key exits are likely coming.", "language": "en", "text": "WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann announced he was resigning as CEO earlier this week, and now a wave of people in his inner circle are also departing.\n\nZvika Shachar, head of global security, is leaving. So is Roni Bahar, WeWork's director of development, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Others are said to be on their way out, with some discussions happening this week, including with Neumann's support staff. This story will be updated as more information is available.\n\nSince 2011, Shachar has served in a number of roles, including head of global security and safety; vice president of special projects in the CEO office; and head of global benchmarking and standards, according to his LinkedIn. Bahar joined in 2012, per his LinkedIn.\n\nThe two are said to be longtime friends of Neumann; Shachar and Neumann served together in the Israeli army, where service is compulsory. A source who worked close to the C-suite said Shachar had no other formal security training.\n\nWeWork is also selling off the $60 million private jet that Neumann used, Business Insider reported earlier on Thursday.\n\nWeWork had lined up $6 billion in financing contingent on pulling off raising $3 billion in an IPO by the end of the year. It's also been spending heavily on investing in growth as well as posting wide negative operating cashflows. SoftBank is now planning to pump more money into WeWork, which could unlock other financing options, according to media reports this week.\n\nRead more: SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto says WeWork is a 'gut check' moment for startups eyeing IPOs, and highlights how boards need to change their thinking\n\nNeumann's departure came after a tumultuous few weeks for the coworking giant. Pressure on the company and its leader ramped up even more in August after it revealed detailed financials in its S-1 statement when laying the groundwork for the IPO.\n\nNeumann has been a lightning rod given his financial entanglements with the company he ran, as well as his unconventional leadership style. He will stay on as non-executive chairman, but his voting rights have been slashed.\n\nWeWork mulled massive cuts to its previous $47 billion valuation to win over potential investors, but has now postponed its IPO.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday announcing Neumann was stepping down as CEO, he said intense public scrutiny had become a distraction. Current WeWork execs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham will now head the company as co-CEOs.\n\nIn that statement, the two new co-CEOs said they would be \"taking clear actions to balance WeWork's high growth, profitability, and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.\"\n\nRead more: Adam Neumann is out as WeWork's CEO, but that's no 'silver bullet': VCs and proptech experts think it will take cutting passion projects and cleaning house to right the ship", "description": "Zvika Shachar, head of global security, is leaving.
