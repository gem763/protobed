(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nGeneral Mike Flynn\u2019s legal team was back in US District Court on Friday and his new attorney, Sidney Powell, came loaded for bear. Rather than walk away from the plea deal, Powell wants additional discovery with the stated intention of a) obtaining sanctions against the Mueller team prosecutors who were operating under the direction of the lawless Andrew Weissmann (h/t to Will Chamberlain for the scans of Powell\u2019s filing).\n\nThe issue is Weissmann\u2019s goons concealing Brady material (see the explainer). This is a hot button issue with the judge in this case, Emmett Sullivan. Sullivan, by standing order, instructs prosecutors of their duty divulge exculpatory material to the defense and he his the guy who tossed Ted Stevens\u2019s conviction because of the grotesque misconduct by the Department of Justice.\n\nHere is sort of seems like that when the prosecutors were forced to cough up more material, there was exculpatory material included but they tried to paper over the concealment by stating the material was not covered.\n\nThe reaction was not long in coming. The New York Times\u2019s Adam Goldman, who has been the beneficiary of a lot of FBI and Mueller related leaks and who claimed that terrorist rejoice when the FBI shuts down a leak\n\nFBI diverts resources to hunt down leakers. Terrorists cheer. So do Russians. \u2014 Adam Goldman (@adamgoldmanNYT) August 4, 2017\n\nwas on the job. Check out the lede:\n\nLawyers for Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser, escalated their attacks on prosecutors on Friday, recycling unfounded conspiratorial accusations in a last-ditch bid to delay his sentencing in a case in which he has twice admitted guilt. The move could anger Emmet G. Sullivan, the federal judge who will sentence Mr. Flynn. The filings could magnify any doubts by Judge Sullivan about whether Mr. Flynn truly accepts responsibility for his crime of lying to the F.B.I. and whether he fulfilled his cooperation agreement with the government in one of the lingering cases brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nActually this is entirely bullsh**. Powell is not recycling conspiracy theories. Apparently, what Goldman considers to be a conspiracy theory is this:\n\nIn a pair of filings, Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyers made clear that they view him as a victim of prosecutorial misconduct, amplifying right-wing theories about a so-called deep state of government bureaucrats working to undermine President Trump. The defense lawyers accused prosecutors of engaging in \u201cpernicious\u201d conduct in Mr. Flynn\u2019s case, saying they had been \u201cmanipulating or controlling the press to their advantage to extort that plea.\u201d\n\nIf we hadn\u2019t just gone through over two years of rogue Clinton loyalists in the federal bureaucracy using the power of the state to spy on the presidential campaign of President Trump, to spy on his transition team, and to connive to have a special prosecutor appointed on the basis of a document they either knew or should have known was bogus this might be humorous. But we did and Goldman is delusional if he still holds that these were just devoted public servants trying to innocently oust a president.\n\nThe government has stated that Flynn has fulfilled in agreement. And if Sullivan has any doubts it will be about the prosecutors. I\u2019m 99% convinced that the lambasting that Flynn got from Sullivan, where he was accused of treason, was an effort by Sullivan to get Flynn to not lay down and roll over for what is looking more and more like a dishonest prosecution.\n\nHere\u2019s Rowan Scarborough to remind us of some of the details.\n\nOne of the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn at the White House is fired agent Peter Strzok. He headed the Trump-Russia probe, used the dossier and vowed in a text message to \u201cstop\u201d Mr. Trump. The other agent who interviewed Flynn was the link between the bureau and former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr. Mr. Ohr became the main messenger for Fusion GPS, the Clinton opposition research firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele. He wrote the now-discredited dossier that alleged a wide Trump-Russia election conspiracy.\n\nThe conduct and motives of Strzok and his partner are very much at issue.\n\nHere you have an example of officials, I suspect one of them is named Andrew Weissmann, leaking classified information to Goldman that the government refuses to share with Flynn\u2019s attorney:\n\n\u201cWe must have access to that information to represent our client consistently with his constitutional rights and our ethical obligations,\u201d Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyers wrote. The classified transcripts of the calls make clear that the two men discussed sanctions at length and that Mr. Flynn was highly unlikely to have forgotten those details when questioned by the F.B.I., several former United States officials familiar with the documents have said. It was clear, the officials said, that sanctions were the only thing Mr. Flynn wanted to talk about with Mr. Kislyak.\n\nAll in all, Goldman\u2019s story is a one-sided apologia for the conduct of a team of lawless cretins hellbent on punishing political opponents for fun and profit. It is the prosecutors response to Powell\u2019s brief, not a news story. The are more focused on telling Judge Sullivan and people who might influence him what right thinking people at the New York Times demand that he do rather than covering the story. And the fact that Weissmann and his cronies would come out of the woodwork to slam Powell\u2019s filing shows she is onto something that they don\u2019t want brought to light.\n\nFlynn is certainly playing a high stakes game. And we owe him a debt of gratitude for that. The quickness of the response from Mueller\u2019s goons as relayed through the New York Times shows that they are afraid of what is coming next. Even if Flynn doesn\u2019t walk, more and more of the abuse of power and deliberate misconduct that were Andrew Weissmann\u2019s stock in trade are going to become apparent and eventually someone is going to be called to account.\n\n=========\n\n=========\n\nLike what you see?
