With cannabis laws changing in Australian states like the ACT, we're looking at how you can best protect yourself and stay healthy if you choose to get high.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up with greasy hands, ashamed of myself and my tendency to overeat while (very rarely) high.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been especially stoned, you know that a euphoric state accompanied by a case of unrelenting munchies is inevitable. Here\u2019s some insight into why we crave such terrible food when we\u2019re high and how to eat a little healthier if you\u2019re trying your best to avoid it.\n\nYour hormones are responsible for your case of the munchies\n\nAccording to Janice Newell Bissex, a registered dietician and holistic-cannabis practitioner, your unstoppable hunger isn\u2019t a figment of your stoned imagination. \u201cWhen your stomach is [empty], your body releases this hormone called ghrelin,\u201d she said over the phone. \u201cWhen you consume cannabis, particularly THC, it triggers a surge in ghrelin \u2014 so there is some physiological reason why you have more of an appetite.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that euphoric glow, THC can also increase your sensitivity to both taste and smell, Bissex added. \u201cIt heightens the pleasure of eating, too, which is why it\u2019s such a useful tool for people who are undergoing chemotherapy or are elderly and their appetite is decreased,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is really a good thing for them; it will increase their appetite and they\u2019re more inclined to eat.\u201d\n\nYour brain, too, plays a role in your sudden need for Cheetos. \u201cThere are neurons in part in the hypothalamus, like POMC, and these neurons also tell you not to eat when you\u2019re full,\u201d she said. \u201cThat response is blunted by THC, so if your neurons aren\u2019t telling your body is full, you have more of an appetite.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not your fault \u2014 you have your bodily reactions to blame.\n\nHow to stop overeating\n\nAccording to Bissex, it\u2019s partially because of that increased sensitivity to taste and smell that we tend to lean on junk foods when we\u2019re especially high; you\u2019re probably not going to find any real pleasure in chewing on a celery stick when you\u2019re in a euphoric state. If you\u2019re trying to stop yourself from overeating, Bissex recommends drinking as much water as possible before you get high. \u201cYou want to make sure you hydrate before you medicate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll fill you up a little bit.\u201d\n\nElegant Stoner (!) also has some solid advice on munchie prevention which includes distracting yourself as much as possible, whether it\u2019s a particularly intoxicating movie, or eating a big meal beforehand so you won\u2019t be as hungry while stoned.\n\nBut let\u2019s face it \u2014 you\u2019re probably going to eat anyway (that\u2019s part of the fun, after all), in which case, Bissex recommends keeping away from more indulgent snacks and sticking with \u201chealthier\u201d foods like popcorn. If you\u2019re ambitious, she also recommends sticking to vegetables but adding some good dips, so you don\u2019t feel totally restrained. Elegant Stoner also recommends budgeting your snacks out in advance; set aside a container with a specific amount of Oreos, so you might be less inclined to go for the entire pack.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a little too high in the clouds, Bissex added that you should avoid fatty foods, as difficult as that\u2019ll likely make the problem worse. \u201cEating something with fat in it will increase the absorption and prolong the effect, which is a good thing if you\u2019re taking this as medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to give people extended relief. But if you\u2019re using it recreationally and you do get uncomfortably high, eat things that don\u2019t have fat like fruits or vegetables.\u201d", "description": "I once ate half a baguette and several slices of ham in the rain on a street corner in Amsterdam.
