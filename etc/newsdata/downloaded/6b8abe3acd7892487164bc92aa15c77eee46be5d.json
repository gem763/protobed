Endometriosis is a condition where cells like the ones in the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body, such as in the ovaries or the fallopian tubes. Each month, these cells react in the same way to those in the womb, building up and then breaking down and bleeding. Unlike the cells in the womb that leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape. It\u2019s a chronic and debilitating condition that causes painful or heavy periods, and it can lead to infertility, fatigue and bowel and bladder problems. The condition is fairly common, with around 1.5 million women in the UK living with it. Symptoms vary from person to person but some of the most common include: Painful, heavy, or irregular periods\n\nPain during or after sex\n\nInfertility\n\nPainful bowel movements\n\nFatigue Endometriosis UK\n\n\u2018The surgery involved separating my fused organs, a hysteroscopy, checking my fallopian tubes were clear and work and removing the endometriosis from my bowel and reproductive organs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The excision I the gold standard of care and best treatment option to remove the disease but it doesn\u2019t mean I no longer have it.\u2019\n\nClaudia was first diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease at 11 years old as she suffered with excruciating lower abdomen pains, fatigue, rectal bleeding and migraines.\n\nThe confusion is \u2018devastating\u2019 for Claudia as she\u2019s been told she may never be able to carry a child (Picture: Caters News)\n\nShe spent 15 years being treated for the disease until 2017 when doctors discharged her and explained she had been misdiagnosed.\n\nClaudia began to do her own research and discovered that the symptoms of endometriosis exactly lined up with her own experience.\n\nShe was finally diagnosed with severe endometriosis by a gynaecologist.
