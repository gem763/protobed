Each one will happen at a different part of your chart,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEach one\u2019s happening in a specific sign and it\u2019s contacting specific planets, and each one has its own qualities. So it\u2019s really about understanding how it\u2019s moving through your chart each time it does, and that it\u2019s different each time we have a Mercury retrograde \u2013 it\u2019s a totally new experience.\u201d\n\nConsidering Mercury enters retrograde multiple times a year, Chani believes the whole idea of being afraid of that particular shift in the planet\u2019s perceived movements is a product of the capitalist society we exist in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s capitalism, it\u2019s a machine that just wants to sell something, so it\u2019s attempting to sell from fear around mercury retrograde,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt happens three to four times a year. So it\u2019s like, happening a lot. So it would be really silly to have to fear something that happens so much.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Channing Tatum Is Furious At The Pattern Astrology App For Being Too Real\n\nSo what does truth does a Mercury in retrograde hold for Chani Nicholas? Although each person can gain different things out of each retrograde, she accepts that it holds a lot of importance in the way we communicate with each other.\n\n\u201cIt is a time where we might hear something in a different way, or learn something about our communication style in a certain area of our life,\u201d she said.\n\nSo there you go \u2013 next time something royally fucks up in your life and you start to think about how maybe Mercury is in retrograde, get out of it. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. Go brush up on your birth chart and figure out instead how that Mercury retrograde can work for you instead.", "description": "Should we be fearful of Mercury when it enters retrograde?
