And we watched every game in the room. The Bruins got us through some rough nights, just me and him. So this means a lot.\u201d\n\nAfter Quinn underwent surgery to remove the tumor, Boston Bruins forward Charlie Coyle sent him a message of support through Facebook during the Stanley Cup playoffs after finding out that they were from the same town of Weymouth, the Boston Herald reported.\n\nCoyle even went to visit Quinn as he was cooped up in his house for the summer recovering from surgery and several rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cIt meant a lot to us,\u201d Waters told the Herald Tuesday. \u201cCharlie really lifted Quinn\u2019s spirits And it means a lot that the team reached out to us when Quinn was sick. It helped us through a rough patch. And now we get to celebrate him being better.\u201d\n\nWaters said Quinn\u2019s last MRI showed no new signs of disease and that the hockey game was Quinn\u2019s first public outing in months since his diagnosis of medulloblastoma \u2014 a tumor located on his brain stem, Boston 25 News reported.\n\n\u201cThis is a little family celebration, actually our first real public outing in, I want to say, nine months,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThere\u2019s no words for it. We\u2019ve been holding our breath for so long waiting for some good news and then we finally got it.\u201d", "description": "A three-year-old who survived brain cancer got the opportunity of a lifetime when he got to drop the first puck at a Boston Bruins game.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/EIGFo5fX4AE9VzF-e1572452280587-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
