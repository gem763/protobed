New England won, 33-7.\n\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS' MASON RUDOLPH BRIEFLY HOSPITALIZED AFTER RECEIVING SCARY BLOW TO HEAD DURING GAME\n\nESPN first reported Gruden\u2019s firing.\n\nGruden, the brother of Oakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden, was in the middle of his sixth season with the Redskins. Washington had only been to the playoffs one time during Gruden's tenure and never won more than nine games in the regular season.\n\nWashington was 4-12 during Gruden's first season before improving to 9-7 in 2015 and 8-7-1 in 2016. But the team appeared to be moving backward the past two years, finishing 7-9 in each season before the nightmare start to 2019.\n\nMINNESOTA VIKINGS FINE STEFON DIGGS OVER $200G FOR UNEXCUSED ABSENCES\n\nAfter Sunday's debacle, Gruden offered some gallows humor when addressing his job security.\n\n\u201cIf the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working,\u201d he told reporters, according to The Washington Post.\n\nA stinging critique of the team's coaching from veteran running back Adrian Peterson in the aftermath of Sunday's loss also indicated Gruden's departure was probably coming sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that something has to change,\u201d Peterson told the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you do know, because we are 0-5. We haven\u2019t won. We haven\u2019t been productive as an offense.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou got to go back to the drawing board and say, \u2018Okay, as a coaching staff...what can we do better to put our players in better position to be productive as an offense, to be better as a defense?\u2019 It\u2019s their job to do that. We 0-5. What we\u2019ve been doing, obviously, isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who will take over as the team's interim head coach. Assistant head coach Bill Callahan is the likely candidate given his experience coaching the Oakland Raiders from 2002 to 2003.", "description": "The Washington Redskins fired Jay Gruden early\u00a0Monday morning after more than five seasons helming the team, according to multiple reports.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
