It is a move that his own senior advisers have warned would risk new chaos throughout the region.\n\nHe is demonstrating that in his pursuit of ending America\u2019s \u201cendless wars,\u201d no American troop presence abroad is too small to escape his desire to terminate it. In this case, the mission has been to prevent Islamic State forces from reconstituting, and to keep another conflict at bay \u2014 a Turkish attack on Kurdish forces, including on those that have been America\u2019s staunchest allies in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTo the Pentagon and the State Department, that is a traditional role for American troops, honed over 75 years of global leadership. But if there is a Trump doctrine around the world after 32 months of chaotic policymaking, it may have been expressed in its purest form when the president vented on Twitter on Monday morning: \u201cTime for us to get out.\u201d\n\nJust this summer, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Syrian affairs, James F. Jeffrey, one of America\u2019s most experienced Middle East hands, told a public forum not to worry about a precipitous withdrawal. \u201cWe plan on having a small residual force to remain on for an indefinite time,\u201d he said. The president, he added, \u201cis much seized with this.\u201d But perhaps not seized the way Mr. Jeffrey imagined.", "description": "President Trump has demonstrated that in his pursuit of ending America\u2019s \u201cendless wars,\u201d no troop presence abroad is too small to escape his desire to terminate it.", "authors": ["David E.
