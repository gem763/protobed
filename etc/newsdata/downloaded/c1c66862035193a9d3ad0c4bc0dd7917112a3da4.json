The company filed for bankruptcy with a more than $10 billion plan to settle claims that it fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic by illegally pushing sales of its addictive OxyContin painkiller. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg)\n\nIn 2008, as Purdue Pharma was searching for a new chief executive, Richard Sackler received a memo from an adviser.\n\n\u201cIn the event that a favorable [recapitalization] deal cannot be structured during 2008, the most certain way for the owners to diversify their risk is to distribute more free cash flow to themselves,\u201d F. Peter Boer, a member of Purdue\u2019s board of directors told Sackler, a prominent member of the wealthy family that owns the company.\n\n[Read the 2008 memo from a Purdue board member to Richard Sackler]\n\nThat, authorities allege, is exactly what the Sackler family did. A lawsuit filed by the state of Massachusetts claims the Sacklers transferred more than $4 billion from the company to personal accounts between 2008 and 2016. Oregon asserts the family may have taken as much as $10 billion out of the company.\n\nNow, as the maker of OxyContin heads to bankruptcy court, those billions represent a central sticking point in the company\u2019s plan to resolve thousands of lawsuits against it. Purdue said in a court filing that it will ask the bankruptcy judge, Robert D. Drain, to take the unusual step of halting more than two dozen lawsuits by state attorneys general against the Sackler family.\n\n[Purdue Pharma, drugmaker accused of fueling the opioid epidemic, files for bankruptcy]\n\nThat has angered attorneys general who say the wealthy family should be doing more to address the opioid crisis. If the Sacklers want special protection from the bankruptcy court, they should be forced to give a detailed accounting of their wealth, said North Carolina\u2019s attorney general, Josh Stein, who sued eight members of the family individually Tuesday.\n\nThe Sacklers want protection from lawsuits \u201cso they can get on with their lives. I am fine with that as long as they meaningfully address the problem\u201d caused by the opioid epidemic, Stein said in an interview. \u201cThey have billions and billions and billions of dollars that they have sucked out of Purdue Pharma.\"\n\nStein said that money should be used \"to right the wrongs that they have done.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Sackler family, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, denied the allegations in the North Carolina lawsuit as well as more than two dozen other cases filed across the country. The spokesman declined to comment on the details of Purdue\u2019s ongoing bankruptcy and denied that the Sackler family improperly took money from Purdue.\n\nPurdue\u2019s tentative settlement with more than 2,000 plaintiffs in a mammoth federal lawsuit and about half the attorneys general in the United States demands protection from all litigation for the company. In return, the Sacklers would relinquish control of the firm, declare it and related corporate entities bankrupt, turn over assets they claim are worth $10 billion to $12 billion, and resurrect the company as a \u201cpublic benefit trust\u201d whose primary mission would be to produce addiction treatment and anti-overdose drugs.\n\nThe settlement was the result of \u201cmonths of intense, arduous, careful, and complex negotiations with dozens of relevant stakeholders,\u201d Marshall Huebner, lead restructuring counsel for Purdue, told the bankruptcy court Tuesday. \u201cVery much is at stake here, dare I say, for our country and for states, counties, cities and towns. Billions of dollars of value, and millions of doses of opioid overdose rescue drugs at no or low cost.\u201d\n\n[Purdue Pharma reaches tentative settlement in federal, state opioid lawsuits]\n\nBut about half the attorneys general who have sued the company and the family are refusing to go along with the deal. Some contend that the Sacklers knew litigants would be coming after that money and transfers into their personal holdings and trusts amounts to \u201cfraudulent conveyance\u201d \u2014 an illegal attempt to hang on to it.\n\nLast week, Letitia James, New York\u2019s attorney general, said in a court filing that her office had found wire transfers of nearly $1 billion by the Sackler family that suggested attempts to shield their money from litigation.\n\nConnecticut Attorney General William Tong said in April: \u201cWe will not allow Purdue Pharma to cry poverty after illegally transferring hundreds of millions of dollars to members of the Sackler family \u2014 unearned funds these individuals reaped as Connecticut families suffered.\u201d Purdue\u2019s headquarters is in Stamford, Conn.\n\nHuebner told the court that a special committee of Purdue\u2019s board of directors has taken \u201cvery seriously\" such allegations and that a forensic investigation of transactions between the Sacklers and Purdue over the past decade is underway.\n\nThe committee has also reviewed 140 contracts between Purdue and the family, he said. Of those, 49 contracts were terminated and two were amended. \u201cI remain hopeful that parties may be more willing to come on board with the settlement framework as they learn more about certain facts and numbers,\u201d Huebner said.\n\nPurdue comes to bankruptcy court with little debt and a few valuable assets, chief among them is OxyContin, the extended release painkiller that is still under patent and is widely blamed for triggering the prescription opioid epidemic in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n[Follow the Post's investigation of the opioid epidemic]\n\nThe drug generated $790 million last year, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post. But as patents for the tamper-resistant version of OxyContin expire, its value will decline steeply over the next 10 years.\n\nSteve Miller, chairman of the company\u2019s board, has estimated Purdue\u2019s assets at about $3.5 billion.\n\nAbout $4.5 billion of the settlement deal is based on the assumption that the Food and Drug Administration will approve a trio of \u201crescue drugs\u201d that Purdue has in the works. Those include a generic form of Suboxone, used to treat opioid addiction; an inexpensive version of naloxone, the drug that first responders and others carry to reverse overdoses; and the drug nalmefene, which Purdue is developing to reverse overdoses from illegal street fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin.\n\nCompany officials have expressed confidence that the drugs will be approved by the FDA, which has fast-tracked the nalmefene application. But that drug\u2019s effectiveness has not been proved in clinical trials, which began last summer.\n\nThe Sackler family, which has several branches and is descended from brothers who started the company in the 1950s, has agreed to put $3 billion in cash into the deal over seven years. That could come from their own funds, or from the sale of Mundipharma, their international drug company, or a combination of both. If Mundipharma\u2019s sale generates an unexpected windfall, creditors would get more.\n\nThe attorneys general who oppose the deal say that $3 billion is not enough. The deal\u2019s value depends on Purdue assets that may be smaller than current estimates, some have said.\n\nForbes has estimated the Sackler family\u2019s net worth at $13.5 billion, which the magazine said makes the Sacklers one of the wealthiest families in the United States.\n\nTypically, a bankruptcy filing halts pending and future lawsuits against a company. But in this case, Purdue has said it will ask the court to extend that special protection to a third party \u2014 the Sacklers.\n\nThe Sacklers are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the lawsuits against Purdue, the company said in a court filing.\n\nIf the court were to halt lawsuits against the Sacklers, it would be an unusual step, bankruptcy experts say. Protection from lawsuits is usually reserved for the parties that have filed for bankruptcy, not third parties related to the case. These types of arrangements have become more common over the last 20 years, especially in bankruptcy courts in New York and Delaware, but remain controversial, they say.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing assumes an honest system, and it\u2019s not an honest system. The Sacklers are choosing their court,\u201d one that is more likely to go along with a potential third-party release, said Lynn M. LoPucki, a professor at UCLA Law School. \u201cThe courts are granting them in situations where they haven\u2019t be able to grant them traditionally.\u201d\n\nThe judge could decide to grant the Sacklers a stay, halting lawsuits while Purdue is in bankruptcy and permanently release them from liability, if a reorganization plan for Purdue is approved, said Jonathan Lipson, a professor at Temple University\u2019s Beasley School of Law.\n\n\u201cGranting third parties, such as the Sacklers, a release is a growing phenomenon, but it\u2019s problematic,\u201d he said. The third parties seeking court protection from lawsuits do not usually undergo the same level of scrutiny as the entity that filed for bankruptcy, he said.\n\nThe Sacklers, for example, will not have to give a detailed disclosure of their financial holdings, bankruptcy experts said.\n\n\u201cOften, the people that most want a release are those that may have harmed the company,\u201d Lipson said.\n\nCourts sometimes stay litigation against corporate officers or directors considered important to the company\u2019s reorganization, he said. \u201cThe challenge for the Sacklers will be that they are walking away from the company \u2026 unlike the ordinary managers who might be entitled to this special protection,\u201d Lipson said.\n\nState attorneys general are expected to argue that their state law enforcement responsibilities should override the bankruptcy protection being sought for the Sacklers. The family violated local consumer protection laws that are outside federal jurisdiction, they could argue.\n\n[Opioid death rates soared in communities where pain pills flowed]\n\nThey could also attempt to claw back the billions several state attorneys general have alleged the Sacklers transferred from the company. But state statutes of limitations could limit how much they may be able to recover.\n\nA chart included in Massachusetts\u2019 Jan. 31 lawsuit shows that the Sacklers voted to pay themselves money from Purdue\u2019s proceeds between 2008 and 2016. The payments were generally made every few months in amounts that ranged from $50 million in April 2008 to more than $350 million for all of 2013.\n\nLawyers for the Sackler family responded that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s lawsuit contains \u201cmisleading and inflammatory allegations\u201d and took internal company emails out of context in alleging that the family and Purdue should be held accountable for death and addiction from opioids.\n\nIn addition to efforts by state attorneys general to pursue the family\u2019s assets, the judge could also reject the settlement terms, forcing the Sacklers to put up more money, bankruptcy experts say. The court must weigh whether the family is paying a fair amount given the number of lawsuits they face and potential damages, they say.\n\n\u201cWhat is going to be most important to the judge in deciding whether to grant them a release at the end of the case is the dollar amount: How much are the Sacklers putting in,\" Lipson said. \u201cUntil the plan is approved, everything is up in the air.\"", "description": "Purdue has said it will ask the bankruptcy judge to take the unusual step of halting more than two dozen lawsuits by state attorneys general against the Sackler family, which Forbes estimates is worth $13 billion.", "authors": ["Renae Merle", "Reporter Covering White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street", "Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "September At Pm", "Renae Merle Covers White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street For The Washington Post.
