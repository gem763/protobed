The impetus the fans provide from the terraces could be a telling factor, it gives the players more energy than you can imagine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great atmosphere as we face one of the world\u2019s best clubs.\u201d\n\nThe clash against United will be played under tight security as hundreds of visiting fans are expected to make the trip to the cauldron of Partizan stadium in Serbia\u2019s capital.\n\nPartizan top the group with four points from two games, ahead of United on goals scored. Third-placed AZ Alkmaar have two points and bottom team Astana none.\n\nMilosevic, who won the 1996 English League Cup with Villa, acknowledged Partizan faced a tall order against the club Partizan beat 2-1 on aggregate in the 1966 European Cup semi-finals.\n\n\u201cThat is a bygone era and going down memory lane doesn\u2019t get you anywhere in football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cManchester United are a top team even if they are having a rough patch and we are likely to face many of the problems our cross-town rivals Red Star encountered in Tuesday night\u2019s 5-0 Champions League drubbing by Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true Red Star beat (eventual winners) Liverpool 2-0 at home in last season\u2019s Champions League group stage but that was nothing short of a miracle and they don\u2019t happen very often.\n\n\u201cWe have the utmost respect for United but we don\u2019t fear them. We will try to play our best football and leave it all out there on the pitch, that\u2019s all anyone can ask for.\u201d\n\nPartizan lost the 1966 final to Real Madrid 2-1 and Red Star won European football\u2019s most prestigious club competition in 1991.", "description": "Partizan Belgrade fans must be on their best behaviour while supporting their team against Manchester United in their Europa League Group L clash on Thursday, the Serbian side's coach Savo Milosevic said.", "authors": ["Zoran Milosavljevic", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444117388&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M17Q", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
