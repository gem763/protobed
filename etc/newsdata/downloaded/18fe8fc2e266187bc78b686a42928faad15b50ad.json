((Courtesy of Jenna Evans)/(Courtesy of Jenna Evans))\n\nIt was hard for Jenna Evans to figure out when the dream ended and real life began. She and her fiance, Bobby Howell, were on a high-speed cargo train. The bad guys were coming. To protect her engagement ring, Howell told her, there was only one thing she could do: Swallow it.\n\n\u201cSo I popped that sucker off,\u201d Evans remembered in a Facebook post that\u2019s since gone viral, \u201cput it in my mouth and swallowed it with a glass of water\u201d \u2014 right about the time she woke up.\n\nSomething didn\u2019t feel right. Did she really just throw back her 2.4-carat diamond ring like a pill? No, she thought, of course not. It was just a dream.\n\nShe closed her eyes. When she woke up again, she saw it clearly in the light: The ring was really gone.\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up and it was not on my hand, I knew exactly where it was,\u201d Evans, who has a history of sleepwalking, told KGTV. \u201cIt was in my stomach.\u201d\n\nPics or it didn\u2019t happen? She has those.\n\nSo, in case you missed it, I swallowed my engagement ring in my sleep on Tuesday night. I actually remember doing it,... Posted by Jenna Evans on Thursday, September 12, 2019\n\nLast Wednesday, the 29-year-old San Diego resident and her befuddled but very concerned fiance rushed to the emergency room around 8 a.m., \u201cwhere I struggled to explain why I was there.\u201d\n\nDoctors soon discovered what Evans\u2019s dream had already told her: She really did swallow her engagement ring in her sleep. On the X-ray, the crystalline circle floating in her abdomen was hard to miss.\n\nNow came the harder question: How to get it back?\n\n\u201cEvery girl, I think, wants as big a ring as she can get \u2014 until you swallow it and are trying to figure out what to do next,\u201d Evans told NBC 7.\n\nThe doctor recommended against letting nature take its course in this case. (\u201cThank God,\u201d Evans wrote on Facebook.) So Evans headed over to a crew of gastroenterologists, \u201cwhere I got to tell a whole new group of doctors and nurses that yes, I swallowed my engagement ring,\u201d Evans wrote in her post.\n\nThe ring was migrating by now. It was starting to really hurt. \u201cAt this point,\u201d she said, \u201cI could definitely feel it in my guts.\u201d\n\nThe specialists had a plan: Evans would undergo an upper endoscopy later that morning. They would pluck it out of her.\n\nThey said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry its not big deal,\u201d Evans wrote, \u201cbut please sign this release form just in case you die.\u201d\n\nSo Evans signed the form and closed her eyes again, feeling the woozy sleep of anesthesia coming on, hoping she would live to marry to Howell. Once she was out, the doctors snaked a little camera down her throat, past her stomach \u2014 and then they saw it: a glowing, shiny object on its way into the small intestine.\n\n\n\nThe ring travels out of Evans's small intestine. ((Courtesy of Jenna Evans)/(Courtesy of Jenna Evans))\n\nEvans opened her eyes again. The ring wasn\u2019t on her finger.\n\nThis time, Howell had it.\n\n\u201cBobby finally gave my ring back this morning,\u201d Evans wrote in her post on Thursday. \u201cI promised not to swallow it again, we\u2019re still getting married and all is right in the world.\u201d\n\nBy Monday morning, Evans\u2019s Facebook post had been shared more than 60,000 times. She spent the week recovering from surgery \u2014 her first request: a double-double burger from In-N-Out \u2014 and on Monday morning went back to work.\n\nThe couple, who have been dating for more than five years, plan to tie the knot next May in Texas, where Evans is from.\n\nIn the meantime, Evans said doctors recommended she see a sleep specialist, advice she plans to take.\n\nFor now, she takes the ring off at bedtime.\n\nCorrection: This story initially misstated when Evans went to the hospital.
