Prosecutors singled out the drug lord as having ordered the murder of DEA Agent Enrique Kiki Camarena in 1985.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office from the Eastern District of New York announced a civil forfeiture lawsuit attempting to seize eight properties in and around Guadalajara, Jalisco. The properties belonging to Rafael Caro Quintero \u2014 a one-time leading figure within the Guadalajara Cartel. Several major cartels splintered off from the Guadalajara Cartel including the Sinaloa Cartel. Those properties are listed under the name of proxy individuals but are actually controlled by the drug lord, prosecutors allege. The properties include multiple ranches, warehouses, and some plots of land that have since become luxury buildings.\n\nProsecutors allege that Caro Quintero led his own criminal enterprise from 1980 until at least 2015 moving large scale quantities of drugs from Mexico into major U.S. cities. Proceeds from those drug deals were used to purchase the properties in Mexico, prosecutors claim. In an attempt to hide the illegal source of his income, Caro Quintero used relatives and front men to be listed as the business owners when in fact he was the real owner, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAuthorities arrested Caro Quintero in 1985. a court in Mexico found him guilty of the murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena. A judge in Mexico ordered his release in 2013 on a \u201ctechnicality.\u201d Mexican authorities released the drug lord before the U.S. government could formalize a request for extradition.\n\nIn 2018, federal authorities added Caro Quintero to the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list and offered a $20 million cash reward for his capture. Since his release, Caro Quintero is believed to have retaken a key role in the drug trafficking world.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
