(Eric Cabanis/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nGwendoline Desarm\u00e9nien wanted to have a baby. But as a single woman in France, she was by law denied access to in vitro fertilization.\n\nAnd so Desarm\u00e9nien drove from her home in Montpellier across the border into Spain, where she found a clinic and a hotel where she could stay during her treatment.\n\nThe expedition was expensive, costing Desarm\u00e9nien, a human resources officer of moderate means, about $6,600. But one of the hardest parts, she said, was feeling that her country thought she was doing something wrong.\n\n\u201cAll these restrictions that we have show a lack of an open spirit \u2014 that we still have difficulty evolving and modernizing,\u201d said Desarm\u00e9nien, 43, whose daughter is now 1\u00bd . \u201cI think French society has difficulty realizing that the family isn\u2019t just a father and a mother. And if we are in the process of advancing, it is slowly.\u201d\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is trying to encourage that advancement by changing French law on reproductive technology. It\u2019s his most significant social initiative to date. And it would bring France in line with what is legal and routine in many other European Union countries. Ten E.U. nations permit the treatments for single women and lesbian couples, and seven others allow them them for single women but not lesbian couples.\n\n\u201cThe criterion that defines a family is the love that unites a parent and child,\u201d Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said when introducing the bill in Parliament.\n\nBut the effort has produced a backlash \u2014 which should be visible in protests planned for Sunday in Paris and across the nation.\n\nWhile French liberals say the question is about basic rights for women, conservatives say it\u2019s about children\u2019s rights to have a father.\n\nThe government, said far-right agitator Marion Mar\u00e9chal, is trying \u201cto voluntarily deprive a child of a father or to transform him and the mother who carries him into a consumer product.\u201d\n\nFrance currently limits access to medically assisted reproduction \u2014 including artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization (IVF) \u2014 to heterosexual couples who are married or have been living together for more than two years.\n\nThe revised bioethics law proposed by Macron\u2019s government would extend access for single women and same-sex couples. Women younger than 43 would be eligible for artificial insemination and up to four rounds of IVF, fully covered by the French health system. Women in their mid-30s would also get coverage for egg freezing \u2014 something now only available to women undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments that could compromise fertility. A ban on surrogacy would remain in place.\n\nThe bill passed in the French Parliament\u2019s lower house late last month and is slated for discussion in the Senate in the coming weeks.\n\nIt won\u2019t become law without a fight, though.\n\nFrance is often seen as decidedly laissez-faire when it comes to sex and private life. But every so often, the conservative core of what remains a nominally secular but culturally Catholic country erupts.\n\nIn 2013, hundreds of thousands took to the streets to protest same-sex marriage. Now, many of the same conservative religious leaders and far-right politicians in that effort are urging people to protest the bioethics bill.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s unfair to want to authorize the manufacture of children voluntarily deprived of a father,\u201d reads the call to arms of the group organizing Sunday\u2019s demonstrations. \u201cBecause this would weaken the familial tissue and thus all of society.\u201d\n\nThe head of the French bishops conference suggested Catholics had a duty to protest. The far-right National Rally has said the issue should be put to a referendum.\n\nThere is some debate outside the political sphere, as well.\n\nIn an official opinion published days before the new bill was debated in Parliament, France\u2019s National Academy of Medicine expressed its support for \u201crecognizing the legitimacy of the desire for maternity in any woman whatever her situation.\u201d But the academy also warned that \u201cthe deliberate conception of a child deprived of a father is a major anthropological break that is not without risks for the psychological development of the child.\u201d\n\nOlivier Ami, a fertility specialist in Neuilly, an affluent Paris suburb, said in an interview that such concerns are misplaced. He pointed to how many single mothers already exist in France. About 30 percent of his patients have sought reproductive assistance abroad, he said. Spain, Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands are common destinations.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t forcibly marry all the women who are single mothers \u2014 it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Ami said.\n\nBut while he overwhelmingly welcomes Macron\u2019s revised bioethics law, Ami also voiced reservations about a provision in the bill that would require all potential sperm donors to accept that their identities could be one day be disclosed at the child\u2019s request.\n\nWhen questioned by French lawmakers about this provision, Buzyn, the health minister, said that anonymity probably would survive because couples would not know the identity of their donor, and the donor would never be obligated to meet the child his sperm produced. But lawmakers responded that nothing could stop a child from one day being able to track down a donor if given his identity.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it will be possible to donate anonymously or not,\u201d Ami said. \u201cAt the moment we have no idea what will happen.\u201d\n\nAlthough the debate is heated, political analysts do not expect turnout at Sunday\u2019s rally to rival the anti-gay-marriage protests in 2013, when police said the number of demonstrators reached as high as 340,000 in Paris alone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a new political moment,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, a political scientist and senior pollster at IFOP, one of France\u2019s leading polling agencies.\n\nMacron, a nominal centrist, has scrambled political allegiances and won over some of France\u2019s practicing Catholics \u2014 through his response to the catastrophic Notre Dame fire in April, and by declaring that the nation is \u201cfortified by the engagement of Catholics.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church also no longer occupies as important a position in the lives of many French citizens, especially among younger generations.\n\n\u201cIf this is a political question,\u201d Fourquet said, \u201cit\u2019s also about the evolution of French society, which is leaving, little by little, a certain frame of reference behind.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWhile Washington is checked out, Macron is pushing to lead the Western world\n\nFour officers killed in stabbing at Paris police headquarters\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The effort has produced protests from religious conservatives and on the far right.", "authors": ["James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UbFXHIYRkG6yUgHcM1wrcmTsipw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GYOGGXXHDYI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
