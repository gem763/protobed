A commitment to open up more federal waters to offshore drilling has stalled amid legal and political pushback, the administration's move to expedite permitting of pipelines, including for Keystone XL and the Mountain Valley Pipeline has been challenged in court, and states have sued over a rollback on methane emissions rules that even some oil companies have complained is too broad.\n\nDuring the meeting, Wayne D\u2019Angelo, head of energy litigation at D.C.-based Kelley Drye & Warren LLP, noted that EarthJustice, Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups had sued the administration more than three hundred times over its rollbacks of Obama-era rules, including those on methane emissions and hydraulic fracturing.\n\n\u201cThere is a metric buttload of litigation going on in respect to the regulatory agenda,\u201d D\u2019Angelo said, adding that there were \u201ca lot of early wins for environmental lawsuits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see the agencies focusing on fewer high impact rules\u201d as the 2020 election nears, D\u2019Angelo added. \u201cMaybe continue to do stuff with guidance, in full knowledge that\u2019s easy-come, easy-go. Whatever you do through guidance can be taken away through guidance.\u201d\n\nBarron said the agenda was struggling because of a talent deficit at federal agencies, which he attributed to an unwillingness among many experts to work for President Donald Trump.\n\n\"For some, the reticence that comes out of the administration on non-energy components, some of the things he may say about some other issues or you may read tweets about, may suggest to yourself that you don\u2019t want to have speeches like this for the next 25 years or get introduced as such-and-such from the Trump administration,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a real reluctance for some real competent people to serve in this administration, apart from the fact they weren\u2019t going to invite you in if you weren\u2019t supporting him from the beginning.\"\n\nBarron singled out Interior Secretary David Bernhardt as a rare \"competent technocrat,\" among a mostly inexperienced staff. \"They may want to implement policy, but at some point you need people who are familiar with Washington, who know how to draft a regulatory rule, have experience doing that at a big level,\" he said.\n\nThe trade association did not dispute the recording's authenticity. \"It seems to be from that meeting,\" IPAA spokesperson Jennifer Pett said in an email. \"However, it was off-the-record, so we did not transcribe or record the conversation; so this document cannot be verified as 100 percent accurate.\"\n\nIn the audio, Katie Schroder, a partner at Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP in Denver who focuses on energy development on federal lands, noted that government lawyers could drop defense of the ongoing lawsuits if Trump loses in 2020.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we have to look at the shot clock,\u201d Schroder said at the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re not far from 2020, we\u2019re not far from the next election. Will some of this litigation be resolved by the time the next administration comes in? That\u2019s always part of the calculus.\"\n\nShe said the industry wanted to see more than guidance documents and executive orders from the administration.\n\n\"The real win is to get some regulatory changes in place. ... I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough energy and drive at Interior to do those things,\u201d she said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d8/22/52932bc2429c888e9ce14f5a98c8/ap-19268556489846-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
