He\u2019s been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous.\u201d\n\nPopovich, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, went on seemingly to compare Silver favorably with Trump \u2014 although he did not mention the president by name.\n\n\u201cA big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for him to say. (Silver) said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril.\n\n\u201cBut he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. So I\u2019m thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all talked about or heard about all the questions that all the talking heads have and everybody had for the last three years, \u2018What kind of country do you want to be? Who are we? Where do we want to go?\u2019\n\n\u201cAdam said something that helps you understand what direction you need to go in, rather than the cowardice of not being able to respond to something of the murder of Mr. (Jamal) Khashoggi. There are many, many incidents like that where leadership and courage mean nothing. It\u2019s all about personal aggrandizement.\n\n\u201cSo I was thrilled.\u201d\n\nSilver was preparing to fly from Tokyo to China on Wednesday for scheduled pre-season games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets when the Shanghai Sports Federation scrapped a planned fan event citing Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate statement\u201d and Silver\u2019s \u201cinappropriate position.\u201d\n\nPress availabilities with the teams were cancelled.\n\nChina\u2019s state broadcaster and internet giant Tencent \u2014 which streams NBA games \u2014 had already said they would not air the two Lakers-Nets games and major Chinese sponsors have cut ties.", "description": "Miami (AFP) \u2013 San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d by NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s defense of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/b66076_nba-san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich-who-guided-us-team-basketball-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
