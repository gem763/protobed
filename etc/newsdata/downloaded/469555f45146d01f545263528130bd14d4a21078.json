Designers will have to learn to talk to engineers and statisticians. They\u2019re going to have to work on their digital literacy.\u201d\n\nRahul Mooray studied engineering: \u201cInitially aerospace then mechanotronics, which is more about coding and control systems.\u201d On graduating, he ran a small fashion business manufacturing leather accessories in Italy. \u201cIt was fun but I missed technology,\u201d he says.\n\nHe now works for Australian start-up Citizen Wolf, which makes bespoke T-shirts on demand. The big idea? To use tech to solve one of clothes shopping\u2019s greatest pain points: fit, and to introduce mass personalisation online. The company works on a one-piece production system, laser-cutting the shirts, one at a time, as the orders flow in, and sewing them on site in its Sydney workshop. Mooray built its Magic Fit algorithm.\n\n\u201cWe call it magic,\u201d says co-founder Zoltan Csaki, \u201cbut really it\u2019s maths.\u201d\n\n\u201cCitizen Wolf began by measuring people in-store, so that\u2019s the experience we work from,\u201d says Mooray. \u201cThey literally did thousands of fittings. Every time we receive a new piece of information, the system gets smarter. An algorithm is a formula that takes a set of inputs, runs them through a processor and gives you an output. Basically, it\u2019s a set of rules. Machine learning is the algorithm correcting itself as it learns more.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngela Ahrendts in 2012, when she was CEO of Burberry and helped the brand become a leader in the digital luxury space. AP\n\n\u201cAlgorithms are changing the game,\u201d says Crawford, who was Burberry\u2019s vice-president of IT strategy for seven years while Angela Ahrendts was chief executive and the company was the undisputed digital leader in the luxury space. Burberry was first to live-stream its fashion shows (from 2007). It introduced e-commerce in 2004, and was offering digital customisation of its famous trench coat by 2011 \u2013 eight years before Business of Fashion named personalisation and on-demand production as key trends shaping the global industry.\n\nAhrendts went on to be a vice-president at Apple for five years before leaving in April. Crawford now consults to brands such as MatchesFashion and Jaeger on the AI opportunities for retail. He and Ahrendts both left Burberry in 2014.\n\n\u201cBurberry was rare,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cAll of us who worked there during that period recognised how far ahead we were.\u201d\n\nIn general, Crawford notes, fashion has been slow to adopt tech \u2013 the first e-commerce transaction took place in 1993, but it\u2019s only in the past five years that online shopping has become the norm.\n\n\u201cTell that to a heritage retailer and they might say, \u2018My flagship store is 100 years old. If e-commerce is only 25 and still only accounts for 10 per cent of my revenue, why do I have to look at it differently?\u2019 \u201d says Crawford.\n\nThe answer, of course, is Amazon. And Google. And all the competitors who have already figured out that websites are the new flagship stores.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, cinematography and traditional fashion technology [such as CAD pattern-making software] are converging,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cThis is inspiring new business models, particularly around on-demand production, mass customisation and styling services. Big data is the foundation of it all.\u201d\n\nWe know what product is going in and out of the store; now we have the capability to know more of what\u2019s happening in the rest of your life. \u2014 Craig Crawford, tech expert\n\nAmazon is promising that Alexa \u201ccan help you look your best\u201d. Just ask her to take a photo using the Echo Look hands-free camera, then use the Style Check function to get a second opinion from a virtual fashion editor. The app uses algorithms to decide which outfits work best according to fit, colour, styling and current trends, but this is more than just a fun way to take a selfie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon is collecting data on what people are wearing \u2013 \u201cNot just what they buy, send back, add to cart but don\u2019t buy, or buy and return, but what they\u2019re actually wearing at home,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cIt\u2019s the next phase. We know what product is going in and out of the store; now we have the capability to know more of what\u2019s happening in the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nCreepy? Crawford thinks not. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic, because it opens up personalised curation on a massive scale. Imagine taking 10 years\u2019 worth of the fashion and interiors magazines you love, and years of recipes by your favourite cooking columnist, and a picture of you in your favourite outfit in your kitchen with something you\u2019ve cooked, and putting that into a machine-learning system.\n\nI love fashion, but the current system doesn\u2019t work too well. I think that the opportunity to fix it lies with tech. \u2014 Craig Crawford, tech expert\n\n\"When we know that much about what you like and how you live, we can cut through the noise to surprise you with things that have a real propensity to interest you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in this industry so long and seen so many ways it can be improved,\u201d he says. \u201cI love fashion, but the current system doesn\u2019t work too well. I think that the opportunity to fix it lies with tech. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if every store worked seamlessly for its customers? If we produced on demand to eliminate waste? If we could track a product throughout its life cycle? These things are all possible. The idea that machines are going to take over is just scaremongering.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not a practising Buddhist by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d says Crawford, \u201cbut Buddha says two things drive humans: fear or love. What I tell brands is, stop being afraid and move to the love space.\u201d", "description": "Algorithms and artificial intelligence can speed the fashion design process and even reduce waste, but at what cost?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5843%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6ba72799f16b5fd19c8eebdc3f5b1bc12930cfc7", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
