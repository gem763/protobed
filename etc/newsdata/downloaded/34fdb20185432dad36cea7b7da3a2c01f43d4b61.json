It's often compared to foam rolling, which uses a similar principle to provide muscle relief,\" he added.\n\nAshton has tested the Theragun herself and says from a medical standpoint the devices are \"generally low risk and may provide some real benefit depending on the individual using them.\"", "description": "Percussive therapy provides rapid bursts of pressure into the tissue of the body.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/MainImage_WellnessStory_v07_DAP_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
