Milken Institute\n\nWhile Malaysia has had a race-based economic policy for the last 40 years, it is one of the things prime minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim wants to change immediately when he takes over.\n\nThe People\u2019s Justice Party (PKR) head admitted at a Milken Institute Asia Summit dialogue in Singapore on Thursday (Sept 19) that a \u201cdeficit of democracy\u201d and growing lethargy toward issues like inequality were some of his most disconcerting realisations about the country.\n\nHe added that there had been \u201chardly any focus or concern\u201d around creating policies to deal with inequality.\n\n\u201cI am saying this as a person who is very much involved in politics, and who has struggled, and I am determined to prove that politics is not just the art of persuasion and the concert of power,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe must be prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever is deemed necessary to attract the best minds irrespective of race.\u201d\n\nAnwar added that reforms \u2013 including democratic access to education and enhanced language proficiency \u2013 could in turn attract more domestic and foreign investment and help revive the economy.\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic and accept the fact that for reforms to be effective and meaningful, you must start by energizing the economy and making it work,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of courage and conviction and tenacity and purpose to ensure that we do govern ethically, responsibly, and undertake reforms, beginning with economic reforms. You are not able to propel the economy (otherwise).\u201d\n\nRead also: Half of Malaysians support having only single stream schools \u2013 and most supporters say it can help unite all races: Study\n\nThe politician admitted that dismantling the race-based policy and replacing it with a needs-based policy was \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d.\n\nDespite expected pushback from the Bumiputera majority, Anwar said he believed reason would prevail.\n\nThe Government would also have to engage the public, allay fears, and assure people that the new policy would create a corruption-free Malaysia, he added.\n\nThe haze is ecological warfare: Anwar\n\nReuters\n\nAt the dialogue, Anwar also touched on the recent haze, describing it as \u201cecological warfare.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Governments) can\u2019t just say: \u2018We have to study and take necessary measures so they don\u2019t recur next year,'\u201d he said, adding that companies found guilty of starting forest fires should be made to supply resources to ease health and environmental impacts of the haze.\n\nHe also said governments should take a more active role in policing fires, instead of blaming them on acts of God.\n\n\u201cMillions are affected, thousands of schools are closed. Millions spent by the common folk to buy pills, eyedrops, masks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have been blaming God for the last two decades. God cannot be that cruel.\u201d\n\nRead also: 11 photos of the haze show just why Mahathir is writing to Jokowi about it", "description": "Business Insider - \"I am saying this as a person who has struggled.\".
