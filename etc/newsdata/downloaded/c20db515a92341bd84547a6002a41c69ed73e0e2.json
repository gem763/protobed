Check. Does it involve exorbitant amounts of food? Check. Of course, I celebrate Thanksgiving!\u201d\n\nFor anyone of Pakistani origin, family and food is everything \u2014 and not necessarily in that order.\n\nNo matter what the occasion, if it involves an eating frenzy, count us in. Thanksgiving is not a traditional Pakistani festival but our first-generation Canadian parents gradually succumbed to all that talk of turkeys around them.\n\nYou'll Also Love: 17 Sanity-Saving Thanksgiving Dinner Hacks\n\nAt first, it used to be just a family dinner over the long weekend. Then somewhere down the line, someone suggested that turkey be invited to the dinner table as well. Then gradually, the common turkey fixings began making an appearance: things like stuffing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and roasted baby carrots. However, a key contentious issue was the lack of a rice dish. So wild mushroom rice was introduced, which was met with mixed reviews as most people preferred a spicier, more flavour-packed rice dish as is traditional in Pakistani cuisine.\n\nSo a few years ago, on popular demand, biryani joined the ranks of turkey at the Thanksgiving dinner. And there was no going back.\n\nBiryani is the jewel in South-Asian food\u2019s crown. If you are of Pakistani or Indian descent, or any other type of South Asian, chances are that biryani is either your favourite dish, or at least features on your top five list. It is a meat-based rice dish, made with red meat, chicken or shrimp, in which the rice is cooked separately in fragrant spices, while the meat is prepared in a tomato and onion-based gravy, often with potatoes. The rice and the meat curry is then combined in alternating layers, with mint leaves spread in the middle. Everything is steamed together until it combines into glorious harmony. Then the angels sing.\n\nYou'll Also Love: How My Daughter Helped Me Rediscover My Parents' Culture\n\nIt is a labour of love, and when done right it's the perfect combination of savoury and spicy elements with a tang, since either yogurt, tamarind or plum sauce is also added in between the layers of rice and meat. The meat is delicious and falls off the bone. It is, put simply, umami at its best.\n\nBiryani can also be a controversial topic, as heated debates will spontaneously break out in South Asian spheres over who does biryani best since different regions have slightly varying ways of making it.\n\nMy mom\u2019s biryani, I believe, has magical healing powers, and can cure every ailment up to and possibly including death.\n\nAs my cousin put it, whether biryani should be made with or without potatoes should have been an election issue in Pakistan earlier this year.\n\nMy mom\u2019s biryani, I believe, has magical healing powers, and can cure every ailment up to and possibly including death.\n\nSo, when biryani joined hands with turkey at our Thanksgiving meals, it became a much anticipated annual tradition. A perfect mix of east and west, a physical representation of all we have to be thankful for.\n\nYou'll Also Love: Mini Pumpkin Pies Kids Can Make\n\nThis melange of cultures seems to be happening in all spheres of our lives. We have kept the traditional South Asian wedding events, and added on bridal showers and bachelorette parties. Traditional ceremonies of welcoming a new child have been supplanted with baby showers and gender reveal parties. Eid celebrations go hand in hand with Christmas d\u00e9cor and dinner. At the end of every meal at a get-together, a head count is conducted for who wants a \u201cTimmy\u2019s run\u201d versus who wants chai (there\u2019s always someone who picks both). The result is that we are a lot happier in our hearts, and a lot poorer in our pockets.\n\nTo me, that is the beauty of belonging to two different cultures, of knowing the rhythms of two very different worlds, of understanding two greatly varying perspectives. It is being able to count, curse and convince in two different languages. It is taking the beauty of one and combining it with the beauty of another to make something uniquely charming. It is turkey, with a side of biryani.\n\nAnd now the cure to all ailments: my mom\u2019s chicken biryani recipe.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\nMom's Chicken Biryani\n\nIngredients For Meat Curry\n\n1 lb chicken with bone, cut into pieces\n\n3-4 medium tomatoes, chopped\n\n3-4 medium onions, finely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n\n1 tablespoon minced ginger\n\n4 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n1 teaspoon red chili powder (or to taste)\n\n1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n\n1 teaspoon ground garam masala\n\n\u00bc cup yogurt/tamarind sauce/plum sauce\n\n\u00bc teaspoon orange food coloring (powder)\n\n10 mint leaves\n\n10 coriander leaves\n\n1-2 green chilies, finely chopped\n\n2-3 potatoes cut in chunks (optional)\n\nSalt, to taste\n\nHow It's Made\n\nHeat oil, add finely chopped onions and fry until golden brown.
