I just saw Sam standing next to the wall of windows, screaming and banging on it and there was like somebody trying to stop me.\n\n'I just kept saying, \"Take me to my baby. Where is my baby?\"\n\n'I didn't know she had gone out the window. Then I looked over, and it wasn't water beneath, it was concrete. To lose our baby this way is just unfathomable.\n\n'I never want another mother to have to experience what I had to, to see what I had to see or scream or how I had to scream,' she said.\n\nThe parents do not blame Anello for their daughter's death and say he is still distraught.\n\nAnello is being held on $80,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court on November 20\n\nChloe plummeted 150ft from the 11th floor of the ship onto a concrete dock beneath it\n\nThe open window is shown in an exterior image taken after the accident. The family have previously said her grandfather simply did not realize it was open when he propped her up\n\nAnello said he took his granddaughter over to the windows because she loved banging on the glass at her brother's ice hockey games in Indiana (seen left). He thought she would like to bang on the cruise ship windows too but 'before he knew it, she was gone'\n\n'He was extremely hysterical. The thing he repeatedly told us was, I believed there was glass. He would cry, over and over.\n\n'At no point ever, ever, has Sam put our kids in any danger,' Kimberly said.\n\nAlan added: 'He was very, very distraught.\n\n'You can barely look at him without him crying. She was his best friend.'\n\nThe family is now planning to take legal action against Royal Caribbean which they say they 'obviously' blame for Chloe's death.\n\n'We obviously blame them. There are a million things that could have been done to make that safer.\n\n'Why on earth is a window open on the 11th floor without a screen or anything? Their answer was \"we need ventilation.\"\n\n'Well to that I say, get a fan,' Kimberly said.\n\nThe window on the far left is the one Chloe fell through while being held by her grandfather. The others appear to have handles which allow them to be slid open This photograph was taken by Chloe's father after the accident\n\nChoking on tears as she described her grief, she said that she wakes up every day forgetting what has happened for around 30 seconds before the sadness hits her again.\n\n'The first 30 seconds of the day, I don't remember what happened and then it comes back and I relive what happened. The thing I latch on to is her memory, she just exuded love.\n\n'She loved watching her brother play hockey, she loved gardening with me. She could get anyone to smile.\n\n'I just know that she was destined to do such great things, even in her short life I truly believe she changes so many lives,' she said.\n\nHer father added: 'We'll never forget her. She is part of our soul.'\n\nWhen Chloe's older brother learned that she had died, he told his parents he wished he had been standing next to her because he would have jumped out to save her, they said.\n\nThis was the scene on the 11th deck after the acciden. It was taped off for police to investigate\n\nChloe is thought to have slipped from her grandfather's hands before falling through an open glass window on the ship's 11th floor. The family said he had propped Chloe up against what he thought was a closed glass window, but when she leaned forward, she fell straight through\n\n'I know he believes that. To know he's living that....' Kimberly trailed off.\n\nIn photos shared with DailyMail.com, the 11th floor window can be seen next to others that are closed. They were taken by Chloe's cop father after she had fallen.\n\nDescribing what happened at a press conference in Miami, the family's lawyer Michael Winkleman said Chloe and her grandfather were playing in the area when he saw the windows and decided to take her over to them.\n\n'The grandfather is with Chloe, they're playing and there's this wall of all windows, it's all glass windows.\n\n'Chloe used to love to bang on the glass at her brother's ice hockey games, so her grandfather takes her over to the windows, he thinks it's all glass.\n\n'There's a wood railing along there, he puts her on that thinking she's going to bang on the glass and it's going to be great, and the next thing he knows, she's gone,' he said.\n\nHe did not say why Anello thought it was open but said: 'He literally thought it was all glass. Clearly, he was wrong.'\n\nAsked if the grandfather had been drinking, he added: 'There was absolutely no alcohol involved, Sam is not a drinker.'\n\nFreedom of the Seas cruise ship started its journey at San Juan in Puerto Rico. It moved on, without the Wiegand family\n\nChloe, who was 18 months old, let out a 'blood curdling' scream as she fell, according to witnesses. Her distraught grandfather, right with her, had to be sedated afterwards because he was so upset\n\nWinkleman called it a 'preventable tragedy' and said the window should never have been open so high up.\n\n'What was preventable here was really, why would you ever put windows that passengers could open.\n\n'It was reasonable for him to think this was all glass.\n\n'From his perspective it was all glass,' he added.\n\nChloe was with her parents, older brother and grandparents on the week-long Caribbean cruise.\n\nHer father is a cop from South Bend, Indiana. It was their first night on the ship.\n\nAnello's social media gives every impression of a proud and loving grandparent who doted over his grandkids.\n\nMike Hamann, his boss at the St. Joseph County IT department, told ABC 6: 'Sal works in the IT department, he's a very valuable employee. Wonderful, just, would do anything for you.'\n\nMore support came from South Bend Police chief Scott Ruszkowski, who told WSBT22 in Indiana that it was untrue Chloe was dangled out of a window.\n\n'The South Bend Police Department offers its sincerest condolences to Officer Alan Wiegand and his family during this difficult time following the tragic loss of their child while in Puerto Rico,' the department said in a statement.\n\n'The department asks the community to pray for the entire Wiegand family as they grieve and to respect their privacy.'\n\nRoyal Caribbean said after the accident that they were 'deeply saddened' by the accident.\n\nAnello is being held on $80,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court on November 20.", "description": "Salvatore Anello had allegedly lifted Chloe Wiegand up before she  fell from a window on the 11th floor of\u00a0the Freedom of the Seas cruise ship when it was docked in\u00a0Puerto Rico.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Dailymail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20305102-0-image-a-24_1572308095392.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
