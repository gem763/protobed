The Redskins hired Jay Gruden after they were both fired the next year. Gruden was canned following Week 5 this year.\n\n\"That was a while ago,\" Shanahan said. \"I've been in three different buildings since. My dad retired. He's good. We've accepted what we had to deal with there and moved on. We'll watch other people deal with it.\"\n\nNEW BLOOD:Redskins' top priority this season should be developing QB Dwayne Haskins\n\nMore: Get to know Washington Redskins interim head coach Bill Callahan\n\nIn the conference call , Shanahan expanded on his previous comments regarding the organizational culture.\n\n\"I just learned it's very important to work with people that have the same intentions and you want to go in the same direction,\" Shanahan said. \"Football is a very tough game, and no matter how close you are with people, there's adversity that faces everyone, and when you lose one game, two games in a row, you know what's going to be written and everything, and (if) people live off that type of stuff, it's very hard to survive and get through any tough times.\n\n\"You've got to make sure people are made of the same stuff you are, that have the same intention, same goals and they're ready to fight and work through things and see it to the end.\"\n\nShanahan eventually landed with the Atlanta Falcons as their offensive coordinator, and after a successful two-season stint there, was hired by the 49ers (5-0) in 2017. Through six weeks, San Francisco is one of two undefeated teams remaining in the NFL (the other being the New England Patriots).", "description": "San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan doesn't look back on his days as a Washington Redskins assistant fondly, when he worked under his dad, Mike.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
