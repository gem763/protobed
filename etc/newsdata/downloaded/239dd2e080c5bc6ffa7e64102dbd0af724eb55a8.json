That's the way it needs to be. I need to get on with my life. If you have any feeling for me you will let me do this.\n\n\"Don't use this as an excuse to go off the rails. Bear in mind you were lucky enough not to go to prison again and I did give you a chance and I had to do this by letter because you just won't listen to me at all.\n\n\"I have told you before how I feel and you have chosen to ignore it hoping it will go away, it hasn't.\n\n\"Each day I feel worse.\n\n\"I have to consider my daughter, also and after all you've done, I can't have you back. It's not fair on her and she knows I would never be happy with you. She can never trust you either.\n\n\"Take care, I mean it. Clare.\"\n\nTragically Clare was never able to send the letter before she was killed.\n\nMr Brown recalls the first time he met Appleton and how he took an instant disliking to him.\n\nHe added: \"She told me she had met this lad, she sounded happy enough.\n\n\"They appeared out of nowhere one day at my house in Batley. I took an instant dislike to him.\n\n\"Unbeknown to me, they had just come from my son's house and my son asked me what I thought of him and we both had the same opinion. We didn't like him and want anything to do with him.\n\n\"When I found out he had done time in prison that made me curious. Claire said it was because of some motoring offences.\n\n\"Because of my job I couldn't be seen to be reporting with ex-cons and I told her not to bring him back. She understood why I said it. I would still visit her and I was there fairly regularly.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nClare ended her relationship with Appleton in October 2008 after she found out he had been texting other women.\n\nHe said: \"I was chuffed to bits when I heard she had finished it.\n\n\"Clare came up to us for Christmas - two months before she met her fate - and said George Appleton was making a nuisance of himself. I told her to pack up her things and come back here.\"\n\nOn February 5, 2009, Michael received a call from his ex-son-in-law claiming that he hadn't heard from Clare.\n\nHe said: \"It turned out that my daughter had been beaten, strangled and he had set her on fire and they had to use a cherry picker to get her out.\n\n\"It turns out him being a 'nuisance' was actually attempted rape. He was pulled in and let out numerous times by police.\n\n\"My daughter died because some 'man' couldn't understand the word 'no'.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Clare didn't get the protection that one would have expected. You don't expect to be burying your own child or going to their funeral. That's not the order of things.\"\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded Clare had been let down by \"individual and systemic\" failures by Greater Manchester Police (GMP).\n\nMichael said: \"If I had the information I have now back then I would have marched her straight home.\n\n\"The last moments of my daughter's life were her kicking and screaming trying to get away from Appleton.\"", "description": "Mum-of-one Clare Wood - whose father campaigned for a new law in her name, Clare's Law - was strangled and set on fire by ex George Appleton", "authors": ["Nathan Sandhu", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Greater Manchester Police", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2848961.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Clare-Wood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
