The jury had to choose between life in prison without parole or a death sentence.\n\nThe same jury last month convicted Haskell of capital murder in the 2014 killings of Stephen and Katie Stay at their home in suburban Houston. The jury rejected his attorneys' efforts to have him found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nHaskell killed the couple and four of their children in the living room of their suburban Houston home in 2014. A fifth child, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, was shot in the head but she survived by playing dead.\n\nAfter the sentence was announced, Cassidy Stay, now 20, read a victim impact statement from the witness stand, saying she had initially had felt \"hurt and anger\" after learning that Haskell felt no remorse for killing her family.\n\n\"My closure was the hope that you would feel bad ... I'm letting go of my emotions and I'm giving it to God because he'll take care of me and he'll help me through this,\" said Stay, adding she would continue to live \"my life with happiness\" and forget about Haskell.\n\nRonald Lee Haskell is escorted into court Thursday, Oct. 11, 2019 in Houston. A jury has sentenced to death Haskell, who fatally shot six members of his ex-wife's family in Texas. Jurors on Friday, Oct, 11, 2019, decided Haskell would be a future danger to society and rejected arguments by Haskell's attorneys that his history of mental illness should spare him the lethal injection. ( Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle via AP) More\n\nDuring closing arguments in the punishment phase of Haskell's trial earlier Friday, Harris County District Attorney's Office prosecutor Kaylynn Williford described the terrifying scene as Haskell fulfilled his plan to kill his ex-wife's family.\n\nWilliford described how Haskell shot 4-year-old Zach in the shoulder \u2014 an injury he could have survived \u2014 and said the frightened child scurried in the chaos to his father on a couch, burying his head in his father's shoulder for protection.\n\nBut by that point, Zach's father was already dead, Williford said.\n\n\"He scrambles over to his father, because that's what little boys do,\" Williford said.\n\nHaskell then went over to Zach, pointed a gun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger, she said.\n\n\"How cold and vengeful do you have to be to take the life of a 4-year-old?\" Williford said.\n\nCassidy Stay, now 20, was in court on Friday and cried when Williford detailed the killing of her family. At least one juror also wiped away tears. Stay testified at trial, which began Aug. 26, that she begged her uncle \"please don't hurt us\" before Haskell opened fire.\n\nDefense attorneys argued hard for a life sentence.\n\nNeal Davis III said the 39-year-old man should spend the rest of his life thinking about what he has done and \"die in prison.\"\n\nDoug Durham told jurors that at the heart of prosecutors' arguments for a death sentence is \"anger, hatred, fear, vengeance because of this terrible, terrible crime.\"\n\nDurham said Haskell's long history of mental illness, in which he was treated by multiple doctors, should be considered by the jury as a mitigating factor in deciding that life in prison would be a more appropriate sentence. His attorneys said Haskell heard voices that told him to kill his ex-wife's family.\n\nDurham urged jurors to consider \"compassion and forgiveness\" instead of \"hate, anger\" when making their decision.\n\nSamantha Knecht, prosecutor, places bullets in front of the jury as she speaks during the sentencing phase for Ronald Lee Haskell Thursday, Oct. 11, 2019 in Houston.
