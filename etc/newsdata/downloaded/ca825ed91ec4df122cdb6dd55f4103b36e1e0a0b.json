Supreme Court judge has rejected a Chinese woman's bid to certify a class action lawsuit against a foreign buyers tax designed to tackle the province's housing affordability crisis.\n\nJustice Gregory Bowden dismissed Jing Li's claim after finding that the 20 per cent tax levied against foreign purchasers of residential property in B.C.'s hottest housing markets does not discriminate against either Asian or Chinese buyers.\n\nIn a 43-page decision released Friday, Bowden found that the tax draws distinctions based on citizenship \u2014 not ethnic or national origin.\n\nAnd that people who don't have Canadian citizenship, including Chinese nationals, don't have to pay the tax if they are permanent residents or provincial nominees.\n\n\"The structure of the tax is not responsible for any unequal burden on Asian persons,\" Bowden wrote.\n\n\"It is not a numbers game. Buyers from Asian countries, such as China, receive equal treatment that is proportionate to the demand from those countries.\"\n\nLandmark trial\n\nThe judge's decision comes after a landmark summary trial held to determine the fate of legislation the previous Liberal government introduced in 2016 in order to cool an overheated Lower Mainland housing market.\n\nThe tax initially required foreign entities (including foreign nationals) to pay an additional 15 per cent on the purchase of residential property in Greater Vancouver.\n\nThe foreign buyers tax was enacted in 2016 in response to unprecedented growth in the Vancouver real estate market. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)\n\nThe current NDP government increased the tax to 20 per cent in February 2018 and expanded the reach of the tax to include the Fraser Valley, Capital Regional District, Nanaimo Regional District and the Central Okanagan.\n\nLi moved to Canada from China in 2013 to complete a master's degree in public administration.\n\nShe entered into a contract to buy a half-million dollar condo in Burnaby in July 2016, the month before the tax came into effect.\n\nHer closing date was in November, which meant she would have to pay an additional $83,850 as she was neither a permanent resident nor a Canadian citizen.\n\nUndisputed housing affordability problem\n\nThe case was decided through a summary trial in which both Li and the government argued the case through written affidavit evidence and expert reports from an array of academics who have been among the most widely quoted voices on the housing crisis in the past decade.\n\nJustice Gregory Bowden dismissed the suit after a landmark trial in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver. (Maggie MacPherson/CBC)\n\n\"It is not disputed that there has been a housing affordability problem in the [Greater Vancouver Regional District] for a number of years,\" Bowden wrote.\n\n\"Home ownership in Vancouver became less affordable than all other cities in Canada. Vancouver had become one of the most unaffordable real estate markets in the world.\"\n\nThe judge explained that the provincial government decided to follow in the footsteps of jurisdictions including Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel and Australia in implementing a foreign buyers tax.\n\n\"Local factors did not appear responsible for the inflation of housing prices and public commentary pointed to foreign demand,\" Bowden wrote.\n\nOverwhelming support among Asians\n\nLi argued against the tax on a number of different grounds. She claimed that the province was trying to usurp federal powers over immigration and citizenship.\n\nAnd she also accused the province of violating Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against discriminating on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin or colour.\n\nThe judge found that the tax was intended to \"dampen demand\" and discourage foreign nationals from purchasing real estate. He said it was designed to make the local housing market more affordable without denying non-Canadian citizens the opportunity to own, rent or lease housing.\n\nHe also rejected Li's claim that the tax perpetuates prejudice, stereotyping or disadvantages of Chinese people in B.C.\n\n\"It is also notable that there was overwhelming support for the tax among Asians living in Greater Vancouver,\" Bowden wrote, citing the research of urban studies professor Andrew Yan.\n\n\"Professor Yan states that Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Chinese descent are equally impacted by housing affordability and equally will benefit from any measures that improve affordability.\"", "description": "A B.C.
