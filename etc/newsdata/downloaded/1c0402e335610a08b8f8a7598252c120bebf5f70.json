The official told the meeting that it had \"informed the U.K. that nothing had changed,\" according to an official who was present, and to one diplomat who confirmed that account.\n\nFor the last three weeks, the U.K. has promised fresh proposals on the backstop, but each week nothing has been offered, the Commission official said.\n\nAccording to three EU27 officials at the meeting, they were also told by the Commission representative that the U.K. is now seeking changes in three other areas of the Political Declaration, which along with the Withdrawal Agreement, are the two parts of May's Brexit deal: (The EU has often repeated that is open to changes to the former but not the latter.) The requested changes are:\n\n\u2014 The U.K. would like the future relationship document to refer to a \"best in class Free Trade Agreement,\" which one diplomat explained would mean \u201cno tariffs and no quotas.\"\n\n\u2014 Johnson's government wants to change the dispute settlement mechanism that would resolve disagreements over how the agreement is interpreted in future.\n\n\u2014 It also wants to change the provisions on defense, which officials have interpreted as a request to allow greater divergence from the EU.\n\nHowever the Commission noted that, particularly on the last two points, London didn't provide any further clarification, officials said.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
