A security guard found his body shortly after 6am. He\u2019d fallen into a trench that was dug on campus for renovations on campus.\n\n\u201cThe students are starting their exams soon but we can\u2019t speculate as to the reasons why he was on campus at that time of the [morning] or what happened. The police autopsy will have to determine cause of death,\u201d Louis says.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances are tough to accept. Rudi was a remarkable person. He was very smart and an excellent maths lecturer,\u201d says Professor Lloyd Conley, dean of the education faculty were Rudi had been a lecturer.\n\nLouis confirms the faculty has made trauma counsellors available to the staff of the education faculty, Rudi\u2019s students and family members.\n\n\u201cThe students start exams at the end of next week so our first priority was to ensure they\u2019re okay,\u201d Louis says.\n\nSome of Rudi\u2019s colleagues have laid flowers at his office door. \u201cHe was a brilliant lecturer and a wonderful person,\u201d one colleague said.\n\n\u201cHe touched many people\u2019s lives. I\u2019m incredibly proud to be able to say he was part of our faculty,\u201d Lloyd says.", "description": "Colleagues of Rudi van de Venter (48) are still in shock over the news of the North-West University (NWU) lecturer\u2019s death at the weekend on the Potchefstroom campus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/f0a397ab92d341858df4d9a13bddf01a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
