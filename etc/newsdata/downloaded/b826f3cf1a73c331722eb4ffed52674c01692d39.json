They\u2019ve hardly been a friend to U.S. interests or our allies in the region.\n\nAfter a drone attack on a Saudi Arabian oil field and processing facility last weekend, Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility. The strike badly damaged the facility, threatening the world\u2019s oil supply and scrambling international financial markets.\n\nYemen, a 99% Muslim nation of more than 28 million people, has for five years been in a tug-of-war between its Saudi-supported government, southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates, and the Houthi rebels who are being supplied by Iran. The U.N. recognizes Saudi\u2019s horse as the legitimate government. The UAE position supports a division of the country between what was, until 1990, North Yemen and South Yemen. Unification hasn\u2019t taken, and the Houthis are agents of chaos; they feel unrepresented by the goings-on and have taken to terrorism within Yemen to express their dismay.\n\nThe Saudis are leery of an expanded Iranian influence gaining stronger footing in its southern neighbor. The UAE seems to have concluded that this is a losing proposition, and has been cutting its losses via reduced engagement. The entire situation is causing strain between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, other members of the Arab world, and in Washington, which prefers to have stable relationships with both kingdoms but let\u2019s be frank: Saudi Arabia has always been seen as more important to American interests, and the sitting president\u2019s long-standing relationship with the Saudis only adds another wrinkle to the problems.\n\nThe drone attack only makes things worse. The Houthis are tenacious pests, but universally seen as unlikely to have the capability to launch a sophisticated attack such as was undertaken last week. The international community seems unified in seeing Persian fingerprints on this incident.\n\nBut at a time of great tension, rhetoric such as that offered by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called the attacks an \u201cact of war,\u201d is a little scary. To the Saudis, perhaps. To America? Please tap the brakes a bit, Mr. Secretary.\n\nInstability in the region is a given \u2026 we\u2019re not the world\u2019s cop, and should be very deliberate before committing American might and military to a widening conflict \u2026 something that would incite a part of the world that already hates us. If it\u2019s proven that Iran was behind this, there are some steps we can take before it escalates into full-on warfare.\n\nIt seems clear Iran can\u2019t be trusted, but this is not the time to shoot first and ask questions later. America is no longer as reliant on oil from the Middle East or Southwest Asia as it once was \u2026 but China is, as are numerous other countries much closer to the conflict. Before we go charging in, maybe the Chinese or the Russians or the Israelis can handle the trouble in their own backyard first.\n\nPresident Trump has hinted at action against Iran, but been remarkably measured in avoiding any sort of knee-jerk response that would rope us into war or near-war. That\u2019s to his credit.\n\nThe United States is more than ready to join a coalition of nations set to beat back global threats, but we shouldn\u2019t go it alone.", "description": "Part of what has made America great throughout the years is our standing at the ready to help defend freedom against rogue nations, and to stand up against global injustice and tyranny.
