(Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Before the new-look Los Angeles Clippers could set about getting to know each other, the team pegged by many as the 2020 NBA title favorites first had to sort out who was in and who was out.\n\nEarly on July 6, as word first broke that the Clippers had agreed to sign Kawhi Leonard and trade for Paul George, Landry Shamet awoke and feared the worst.\n\n\u201cMy phone was blowing up and I thought I got traded,\u201d the 22-year-old shooting guard told reporters Sunday at the Clippers\u2019 media day. \u201cI\u2019ve been traded before. I know what that feels like at 2:30 in the morning.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and his deep front office had moved mountains to acquire the pair of all-star wings. Sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder were starters Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, plus four unprotected first-round picks and two pick swaps. Shamet survived the blockbuster, as did roster mainstays like Lou Williams, the reigning sixth man of the year, and Montrezl Harrell. Patrick Beverley, the team\u2019s vocal leader, chose to re-sign with the Clippers less than a week later.\n\nThe arrivals of Leonard and George, two defensive-minded forwards who fit the Clippers\u2019 vision for hard-nosed basketball, are more akin to Kevin Durant\u2019s 2016 move to the Golden State Warriors, rather than LeBron James\u2019s 2018 signing with the Los Angeles Lakers. When Durant went to the Bay Area, his role was clear and the table was set. When James landed in Southern Cal, however, his star power became the Lakers\u2019 identity because his new organization had neither the proven complementary talents nor the infrastructure to support him.\n\nWhile the Clippers mortgaged their future to gamble that Leonard and George could immediately vault them into the title conversation, the headline-making summer moves haven\u2019t triggered an identity overhaul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to maintain that mind-set,\u201d Williams said, when asked how Leonard and George would fit with a team that prided itself on overachieving as underdogs last season. \u201cThat works in our favor with the personalities we have in our locker room. I don\u2019t think we should stop being ourselves because of the addition of those guys. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to tell Pat Beverley to chill out. I don\u2019t think my mind-set changes either.\u201d\n\nBeverley agreed, with a promise: \u201cWe\u2019ll have that same scrappiness attitude, but on steroids.\u201d\n\nLeonard and George, both natives of Southern California, have wasted no time settling into their new environment and getting to know their new teammates. Leonard has donated one million backpacks to local schoolchildren, while George said it was \u201csurreal\u201d to be taking Interstate 405 to work. The Clippers, who will depart this week for training camp in Hawaii, have participated in pickup games since Labor Day and recently went on a deep sea fishing expedition as a bonding exercise.\n\n\u201cThe second this came together, we were all in the group chat talking, laughing and building that togetherness and camaraderie,\u201d George said of his new teammates. \u201cThat relationship was established early. We fast-forwarded all that getting to know each other stuff. You seize the opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\nKawhi Leonard is seeking his third NBA title with his third different team after previously winning with the 2014 San Antonio Spurs and 2019 Toronto Raptors. (Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP)\n\nLeonard said he was struck by the Clippers\u2019 confidence and work ethic last season, and by their balanced approach on offense and willingness to ride the hot hand. The reigning Finals MVP landed in a similar situation with the Toronto Raptors last season, where contributions from all corners helped deliver the first title in franchise history.\n\nOne key difference: Leonard, who was on a load management program last year as he recovered from a quad injury that limited him to just nine games in 2017-18, enters the season healthy.\n\n\u201cYou have to stay healthy as well [to compete for a title],\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYou have to be blessed. Last year I was going in with an injury I was dealing with the year before. It still was lingering. We knew that I had to be healthy throughout the season and into the playoffs. This year I\u2019m feeling good, feeling way better than I was at the start of last season. There\u2019s really no [load management] plan laid out yet to discuss.\u201d\n\nWhile Leonard looks and sounds ready to go full tilt, George will require more patience as he continues to recover from offseason surgeries on both shoulders. The 29-year-old forward said that he will not participate in contact portions of training camp this week, telling ESPN that he is targeting a November return. The Clippers are set to open their regular season schedule against the Lakers on Oct. 22.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m used to being in this rehab stage and knowing what it takes to get my body prepared and up to speed,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long process, but going through it [previously] with a drastic injury in my leg, I know what to expect. I know what pressure to put on myself and what pressure not to put on myself as well. I\u2019m just in a good place. I know what I need to do. I know what I\u2019m capable of. I know when my body\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nMuch like the crosstown Lakers, who downplayed rivalry talk and avoided brash proclamations, the Clippers largely spent their media day trying to tamp down the hype. Although rivals might view them as the NBA\u2019s deepest team and early title favorite, the July celebrations for Leonard\u2019s franchise-altering decision have given way to a more cautious confidence. Coach Doc Rivers told reporters last week that championship expectations are a \u201cprivilege\u201d for an organization that has never advanced to the conference finals, but Leonard looked ready to fall asleep at media day and his new sidekick picked his words more carefully than usual.\n\n\u201cHopefully by June we\u2019re the last team standing,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be scary. We really have a chance to do something special on the defensive end.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAfter a long summer, LeBron James eases back onto center stage with the Lakers\n\nTo speed up games, NBA to experiment with one free throw in G League\n\nFor years, some NBA players lied about their height.
