Democrats said the messages prove \"stunning abuses\" of power.\n\nHouse Republicans argued the texts were a \"unilateral and cherry-picked release\" by Democrats and called for the full release of the transcript of Volker's interview.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some of the most important messages that Democrats released. The messages are taken directly from the documents.\n\nThe documents describe text messages exchanges between five people:\n\nKurt Volker: former U.S special envoy for Ukraine\n\nformer U.S special envoy for Ukraine Bill Taylor: the top American diplomat in Ukraine\n\nthe top American diplomat in Ukraine Gordon Sondland: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Rudy Giuliani: Trump's personal lawyer\n\nTrump's personal lawyer Andrey Yermak: advisor to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nJuly 19: Volker texts Rudy Giuliani to thank him for breakfast and to introduce him to Yermak, a top advisor to Zelensky.\n\nAround the same time, Volker, Sondland and Taylor discuss the goal for the upcoming call between Trump and Zelensky. (\"Potus\" refers to President of the United States.)\n\nJuly 21: Taylor flags Zelensky's concerns about being used for domestic political purposes.\n\nJuly 22: Yermak and Giuliani speak in the morning. Later that evening, Volker informs Taylor and Sondland that Giuliani is \"advocating\" for a phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nJuly 25: Before Trump and Zelensky's phone call that day, Volker tells Yermak that if Zelensky promises an investigation, they'll set a date for a visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nJuly 25: Trump and Zelensky talk by phone. During the call, Trump requests that Ukraine investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and alleged corruption by the Biden family. (No credible evidence has emerged to substantiate those allegations.) Trump asks Zelensky to talk with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.\n\nAround August 2: Giuliani meets with Yermak in Madrid, according to a whistleblower's complaint.\n\nAugust 9: Sondland talks with Volker about arranging a White House meeting after Zelensky makes a public statement. Sondland suggests asking for a draft of the statement.\n\nAugust 9: Volker asks to speak with Giuliani about the Ukrainian statement to see what it should say.\n\nAugust 10: Yermak presses Volker for a date for the White House visit before committing to a statement announcing an investigation into Burisma and 2016 election meddling.\n\nSeptember 1: Taylor asks if the visit and military assistance are conditioned on the Ukrainians opening investigations. \"Call me,\" Sondland responds.\n\nSeptember 9: Taylor says \"it's crazy\" to withhold military aid from Ukraine to assist a political campaign. Sondland says Taylor has misinterpreted the president's intentions, and if Taylor wants to discuss it more, he should do it by phone.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu, Ledyard King", "description": "Text messages released by Democrats show Trump diplomats discussed having Ukraine open investigations to satisfy Trump's demands.", "authors": ["Javier Zarracina", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/04/USAT/7d8531c0-8b78-4684-b90f-ac46354e94ff-LEAD_IMAGE.jpg?crop=1911,1075,x4,y0&width=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
