Make your workplace pension work harder", "language": "en", "text": "Millions more of us are now pension savers thanks to auto-enrolment.\n\nBut how much do you know about where your life savings are being invested, and could they be working harder for your retirement?\n\nHere, BEN WILKINSON explains how by getting to grips with your workplace pension, you can bolster your pot by thousands \u2014 and even retire years earlier.\n\nAuto-enrolment sees workers aged over 22 pay into a defined contribution pension on earnings above \u00a310,000. Your retirement fund depends on how much you squirrel away\n\nSaving for the future without thinking\n\nBefore workers were routinely signed up to workplace pensions in 2013, there were just one million employers in such schemes; now there are more than ten million.\n\nAuto-enrolment sees workers aged over 22 pay into a defined contribution pension on earnings above \u00a310,000. Your retirement fund depends on how much you squirrel away.\n\nThese are different to defined benefit schemes, offered by some public sector employers, which pay out a pension income based on your years of service and final salary.\n\nIf you have been auto-enrolled, you will pay 4 per cent of your wages into your pension, while your employer must put in at least 3 per cent.\n\nThe government effectively adds another 1 per cent in tax relief.\n\nExperts have praised auto-enrolment for getting the nation saving for retirement, but warn it could be misleading workers into thinking they are doing enough.\n\nYou can 'double your money'\n\nBy asking a few questions about how much your employer is willing to contribute, you could boost your retirement income by thousands of pounds.\n\nSteven Cameron, pension director at Aegon, says auto-enrolment has 'lulled people into a false sense of security'.\n\nFigures from the pensions provider show that a 30-year-old earning \u00a327,000 and due to retire at 68, would have a pension pot of \u00a3255,333 if they stuck to auto-enrolment contributions.\n\nYet if the worker upped that by 2.5 per cent and the employer matched this rise, they would retire on a pot worth \u00a3414,916 \u2014 nearly \u00a3160,000 more.\n\nAlternatively, if the same worker was aiming for a pension pot of \u00a3250,000, they would hit their goal eight years earlier by increasing their contributions.\n\nMr Cameron says increasing contributions was 'highly likely to be the most effective way of saving', adding: 'You can easily double your money.'\n\nResearch from mutual insurer Royal London has revealed that around three millions workers are missing out on an estimated \u00a32 billion of employer contributions every year.\n\nSteve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, says there is a 'fantastic rate of return' in saving enough to qualify for your employer's maximum contributions.\n\nHe adds: 'Nothing else you can do comes close to this in terms of value for money. It's like turning down a pay rise if you don't do so.'\n\nWhere is your cash invested?\n\nYour employer decides where your pension is invested, but it is you who bears the risk.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of workers will be invested in their company's default fund. Yet the performance of this will dictate when you can afford to retire and how much you'll have to spend.\n\nDefault investment funds are designed to balance risk and return. But if you are willing to make riskier investments, you could boost your pension.\n\nYour employer or pension provider should be able to give you tools to find out what funds are available and appropriate.\n\nMr Cameron says: 'If you did manage to add an extra 1 per cent return, then over 30 years that could make a big difference.'\n\nSums from Aegon show that the average auto-enrolment pension would be worth close to \u00a375,000 more on retirement if it performed 1 per cent better.\n\nResearch from mutual insurer Royal London has revealed that around three millions workers are missing out on an estimated \u00a32 billion of employer contributions every year\n\nHowever, if you are thinking of picking a more adventurous investment, then you should speak to a financial adviser.\n\nAs many pension pots are put in default tracker funds, your money could end up in tobacco, oil, gambling, or arms firms. This is because tracker funds \u2014 those not managed by a human \u2014 automatically transfer your money to the best performing funds.\n\nAlmost all workplace schemes offer an ethical fund that screens out cigarette firms. But it could be pricey to opt out of the ones you consider to be unethical.\n\nAegon estimates you will pay an extra 0.3 per cent in charges to avoid investing in companies you don't like \u2014 reducing a \u00a3255,000 pot by \u00a314,808 over your career.\n\nHow high are the fees?\n\nPension platforms will soon be required to display fees in pounds and pence rather than as a percentage.\n\nWhile investment firms can charge as much as 3 per cent, default pension fund fees are capped at 0.75 per cent.\n\nBut the difference between an annual charge of 0.2 per cent and 0.75 per cent could be \u00a3114,115 after a 50-year career, according to analyst firm Defaqto's recent report on workplace default funds.\n\nThe report called the cap 'actually quite expensive' adding 'most medium and large employers could be paying significantly less' by shopping around.\n\nBut remember, if you move your money out of your workplace default fund, you won't be protected by the charge cap; if you pull your money out of your workplace scheme altogether, you'll lose employer contributions.\n\nJulian Mund, chief executive of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, concludes: 'Automatic enrolment means the vast majority of people will default into funds that will give them good outcomes by the time they retire.\n\n'Two principles are it is always a good idea to tip more into your pension if you can afford to, and it is never too late to start saving.'\n\nb.wilkinson@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Millions more of us are now pension savers thanks to auto-enrolment.
