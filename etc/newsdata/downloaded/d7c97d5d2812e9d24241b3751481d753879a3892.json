I had to do it.\n\n'We really wanted to win the game, so we attacked a lot towards the end to get the third goal. We allowed spaces [for Palace on the break] but it's because we really wanted to win.'\n\nGuendouzi's actions helped Arsenal preserve a 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium, but it could, and possibly should, have been a whole lot better.\n\nArsenal were two goals to the good inside 10 minutes, but were pegged back by Roy Hodgson's side thanks to a Luka Milivokevic penalty and Jordan Ayew.\n\nSokratis scored Arsenal's opener and later had what he thought was the winner ruled out by VAR.
