If you're in the market for a '40s truck that will stand out wherever you go, then the Earlywine Auctions' Hoosier Classic has just what you're looking for with this stylish, eye-catching Chevy five-window pickup.\n\nTurn Heads In This 1947 Chevrolet 3100 5-Window More\n\nIn stock form, the 1947 Chevrolet 3100 is a sharp truck thanks to the big hood and bigger fenders that gives this design an imposing presence, while details such as the large chrome grille and rounded, five-window cab add plenty of personality. Speaking of personality, this particular truck has a distinctive look thanks to extensive \u2013 yet subtle \u2013 custom touches like the shaved door handles and unique upper taillights frenched into the cargo bed's side rails. And this cargo bed has plenty to show off, too, with rich wood flooring complemented by polished aluminum trim. Perhaps the best part of this truck's design is the dark metallic red paint job with minimal chrome trim.\n\nThe interior is almost entirely customized with late model seats and center console, wraparound cloth trim and aftermarket gauges with billet housings. Under the hood is the hot rodders' favorite 350 CID V8 with headers and aluminum heads, and this engine is paired to a four-speed manual transmission. Since trucks are made for cruising, this 1947 Chevrolet 3100 offers air conditioning in addition to four-wheel disc brakes, and the ride is finished off with five-spoke polished American Racing wheels wrapped in BFGoodrich radial tires.\n\nTo have a shot of owning this beautiful, customized 1947 Chevrolet 3100 five-window pickup truck, then be sure you're registered to bid at the Earlywine Auctions' Hoosier Classic on Saturday, November 9th.\n\nRelated Articles...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Custom touches makes this one cool pickup truck.The 1940s might be the best decade when it comes to the design of pickup trucks, and this 1947 Chevrolet 3100 shows why.
