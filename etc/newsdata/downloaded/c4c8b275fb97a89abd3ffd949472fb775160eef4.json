Biden, while withholding more than $300 million in financial assistance to the country.\n\nRepublicans, though, defend Mr. Trump, saying the transcript shows there was no quid pro quo.\n\nThe survey questioned 2,059 U.S. residents from Sept. 26-27. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
