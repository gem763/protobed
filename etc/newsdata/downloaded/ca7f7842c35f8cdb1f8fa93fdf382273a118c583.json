(Photo: SANACORE)\n\nMIAMI\u2014Miami's hotel scene is just as hot as its beaches.\n\nThis year, the city had major boutique and lifestyle hotel openings including the Thompson Miami Beach, Metropolitan COMO, and Ian Schrager's highly-anticipated EDITION, designed in partnership with Marriott.\n\nMany other hotels are expected to open in the next two years, including the luxury Faena Hotel, SLS lux Hotel, a Yotel, and InterContinental Hotel Group's Hotel Indigo.\n\nMarriott also has grand plans for an AC Hotel, the brand it recently imported from Europe to appeal to younger travels. (The first AC Hotel opened in New Orleans in December.)\n\nWhile South Beach always gets most of the attention, many hotel developers are betting on other parts of the city, including Midbeach, the area north of 23rd Street that has up until now been mostly residential. Most travelers would only go to that part of the beach to hit the hip club and restaurants at the Fontainebleau.\n\nThe Downtown/Brickell area is also now a booming area, with several large real estate and retail developments in the works.\n\n\"Downtown Miami is emerging as a high-energy place to live, shop and work,\" said David Arditi, principal of Aria Development Group, which is building the Yotel, set to open in 2017. \"There is strong demand for urban-chic residential apartments, and Miami's appeal as an international destination is at an all-time high.\"\n\nUSA TODAY took a tour of a few of the new properties. Here's what we found.\n\nThompson Miami Beach\n\nWalk into the new Thompson Miami Beach in Midbeach, and you know you're in Miami\u2014albeit Miami in the 1950s.\n\nThe Art Deco building is decorated in bright colors. The 380 rooms have yellow-patterned carpets and accented pillows. Furniture has rounded edges rather than square corners. The two pools have yellow and orange cabanas.\n\nThe Crown Room, the second-floor lounge, serves classic cocktails in a dark setting that looks like it could be the setting for a \"Mad Men\" scene.\n\nOutside by the pool is another bar called the 1930s House. It is actually a house from the 1930s that was moved to this spot.\n\n\"It's really reminiscent of the '50s and '60s, of what Florida and design and construction were back then,\" says General Manager Brett Orlando.\n\nOrlando says the hotel is trying to appeal to both tourists and locals. That's why the valet parking fee is just $5\u2014almost unheard of in Miami.\n\nLocal celebrity chef Michelle Bernstein was in charge of creating the food and beverage concept. She came up with Seagrape, named after an indigenous Florida fruit that she recalls pointing out to her mom when she was a child on the beach.\n\n\"It was that a-ha moment that reminded me of the past and of my future at the hotel,\" she says.\n\nBernstein is incorporating some of the dishes she was known for at her wildly successful Michy's restaurant, which she plans to re-open, with those that the hotel's chefs have created.\n\n\"We really married everything together to create a menu that is approachable,\" she says.\n\nThe ingredients are local. She scours Miami's farmers' markets for fresh produce. The fish is caught by former classmates turned fishermen.\n\nShe's also trying to lighten up the dishes. The menu emphasizes fish, but even heartier meals, such as short ribs, come in a sauce that is not too heavy. Don't expect to see too many starches on your plate.\n\n\"You can feel sated without feeling gross,\" she says. \"We wanted to appeal to the palate of the people down here as well as all the people who are visiting.\"\n\nInfo: Thompsonhotels.com/hotels/thompson-miami-beach\n\nStarting rate: $359/night\n\nThe lobby of the new EDITION hotel in Miami. (Photo: EDITION Hotels)\n\nEDITION\n\nIan Schrager is often credited with creating the boutique hotel concept.\n\nMany industry insiders were surprised when he teamed up with Marriott, a hotel giant that hasn't always been known for thinking outside of the box.\n\nTheir partnership has resulted in EDITION hotels in Istanbul and London.\n\nWith EDITION Miami Beach, which opened in early December in Midbeach, Schrager has created a hotel where one can sleep, eat, work, and play in over-the-top fashion.\n\nThe hotel has what Schrager calls \"a sort of red-light district, but legal for the wild at heart.\"\n\nA micro-club\u2014a modern-day version of Schrager's legendary Studio 54 in New York City\u2014has soundstage-quality sound and lighting systems created by Patrick Woodroffe, who has curated concerts for Lady Gaga and Beyonce.\n\n\"This picks up where Studio left off,\" Schrager says. \"A visual riot, sensory overload, a truly serious dance club.\"\n\nThere's also a bowling alley with luminescent bowling balls and an indoor ice-skating rink.\n\nAn outdoor resort area is named Tropicale, in honor of the Tropicana, the historic 1950s Havana nightclub. At night it turns into an outdoor nightclub. There's a Terrace Bar overlooking the pool area and a private beach with an outdoor movie screen, a fire pit and private bungalows.\n\nOne reminder that EDITION is a Marriott hotel is the Hot Shoppe, an homage to the original A&W root beer stand that the Marriott family started in 1927.\n\nMichelin star chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is in charge of the food and beverage venues, which include the Market, a reinvention of the 24-hour coffee shop. Schrager bills it as part patisserie, part boulangerie and part salumeria. It offers casual gourmet fast food and dining in an open air caf\u00e9.\n\n\"It's a place that can be your first stop of the day, and your last stop of the night,\" he says.\n\nFor a more formal dining experience, guests can go to the Matador Room, where Vongerichten is offering up a menu with Spanish, Caribbean and South American influences.\n\nAnd if you ever want to sleep, the hotel has 294 rooms, which include bungalows and a penthouse.\n\nInfo: Editionhotels.com/miami-beach\n\nStarting rate: $429\n\nMetropolitan COMO\n\nAnother newbie in the booming Midbeach area is the Metropolitan COMO, an Asian brand.\n\nIt is much smaller and less flashy than its competitors, but its European sophistication makes it an enticing alternative.\n\nThe hotel has just 74 rooms spread out over nine floors in a pre-war Art Deco building designed in 1939 by American architect Albert Anis.\n\nRooms are minimalist with beds covered in white linens, pastel-colored walls and terrazzo floors rather than carpeting.\n\nA room with an ocean view at the new Metropolitan COMO in Miami. (Photo: Graciela Cattarossi)\n\n\"We are the anti-Miami hotel,\" says sales director Thibaut Asso. \"I feel like I'm going back in time.\"\n\nThe restaurant, Traymore, is filled with seafood and local ingredients. The Traymore Bar is billed as Miami Beach's first Gin Club with monthly events and tastings.\n\nCOMO hotels have a focus on wellnesss, so you can also get healthy juices either at the restaurant or the pool bar.\n\nThe Shambhala Urban Escape spa features Asian-based therapies and a rooftop hydrotherapy pool.\n\nInfo: Comohotels.com/metropolitanmiamibeach\n\nStarting rate: $400\n\nRedbury South Beach\n\nSouth Beach is still a hot destination in Miami, and this relative newcomer has added to its trendiness.\n\nThe 69-room hotel is part of Sam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment empire, which includes the SLS hotels.\n\nThis chic boutique hotel is not on the beach but it is across the street from its sister property, the Raleigh, which is oceanfront. The SLS South Beach, also an oceanside sister property, is nearby.\n\nThe bar at the new Cleo restaurant at the Redbury South Beach hotel. (Photo: Ryan Forbes)\n\nRedbury makes up for the lack of oceanfront property with its massive rooftop deck with a pool. The roof has a lovely view of nearby Art Deco buildings.\n\nThe Redbury has whimsical rooms designed by magazine photographer and music video director Matthew Rolston. Each room has a record player with actual records to play.\n\nWhile the hotel has been around for more than a year now, it is celebrating the opening of its new restaurant Cleo.\n\nIt's the third Cleo in the SBE family. Run by chef Danny Elmaleh, it joins its Los Angeles and Las Vegas outposts.\n\nThe Mediterranean inspired menu has tapas that range from $7 to $16\u2014inexpensive for South Beach.\n\nInfo: Theredbury.com/southbeach/\n\nStarting rate: $297\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1zvQZgJ", "description": "MIAMI\u2014Miami's hotel scene is just as hot as its beaches.
