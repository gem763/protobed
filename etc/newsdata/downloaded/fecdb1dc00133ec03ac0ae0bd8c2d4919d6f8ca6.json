With this system, the car is either on it or off it.\n\nIn effect it provides a very good front suspension travel stop for the straights, but not so good if you are coming on and off it in a corner because of kerb inputs.\n\nAt that time the Ferrari used a large diameter coil spring, which gives fairly progressive spring rates but takes up much more space, and the Red Bull used a package of Belleville washers.\n\nYou can play tunes on these Belleville washers as far as stiffness is concerned, and they are also more progressive than what Mercedes were using at that time.\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Mercedes has updated the heave spring element of its front suspension and, having trialled it in the Formula 1 race in Singapore, will retain it for the Russian Grand Prix.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Wd7BJLQZqhmPgPLeXasZGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTYwMDtoPTQwMA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZKmMjtqIxvRtFePATOcqaw--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/401b2a2c7171ada9946968215e287583", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
