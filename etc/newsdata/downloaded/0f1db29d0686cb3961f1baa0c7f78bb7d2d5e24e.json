I think I underestimated what a career in secondary teaching was like \u2013 especially in science. I often felt stressed in the role, and particularly frustrated at myself for not being able to deliver as high quality lessons in physics or chemistry as I could in biology. But I did learn a lot, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful to my mentors during my teacher training period for all of their kind support.\n\nI started as education and outreach officer at the animal sanctuary four weeks ago. My salary is \u00a324,000. I\u2019m responsible for spreading the message about what we\u2019re doing and try to involve the local community as much as we can. The sanctuary has already rescued more than 300 agricultural animals including sheep, pigs, cattle, horses and turkeys. Luckily we have large open paddocks for our animals and provide large woodland areas for our rescued pigs. We\u2019re fundraising at the moment so that we can build four new hen houses which will allow us to rescue an extra 160 hens. Animals come here for a variety of reasons; sometimes they\u2019re from the RSPCA following a cruelty case, or it could be because the owner has had an injury or their financial circumstances have changed.\n\nI live in Bristol where I rent a double room with two close friends in a three-bedroom flat share. I\u2019ve lived there since November and I love it. It\u2019s the first flat that I\u2019ve felt at home in. We\u2019re like a little family; we plan meals together. My housemates and I set a budget of \u00a320 each a week for meals to eat together. We take it in turns to cook each night and we often eat leftovers for lunch. Rent comes to \u00a3500 a month and then bills on top are about \u00a3100 a month.\n\n\u2018I had \u00a330,000 debt, but now I\u2019ve learned to manage money\u2019 Read more\n\nMy parents instilled in me the importance of saving money and only buying what you can honestly afford. I grew up watching them be sensible with money. My mum worked full-time looking after my brother, who is severely disabled, and they were on a low income. Although I earn far less than my boyfriend, who works as a mechanical engineer, I\u2019m probably better at handling money than he is.\n\nAs a result, I\u2019ve managed to save \u00a320,000 through stashing away a minimum of \u00a3200 a month \u2013 although this increases if I feel financially stable. I have a help-to-buy Isa, a Lifetime Isa and a regular savings account. I\u2019d like to use the money to buy a house in Bristol but I think it\u2019s a little out of my budget at the moment. I\u2019d like to save more money. Friends have suggested buying a house together but I\u2019m not sure this is a viable option for me \u2013 I don\u2019t like the idea of any kind of confrontation or the division of assets further down the line.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of [online bank] Monzo. I love the \u201cshared tab\u201d feature as it lets my boyfriend and I pay for everything evenly without having to share a bank account.\n\nBristol\u2019s a great city to live in and I try and make the most of it. It\u2019s really good for music, arts and culture. I love going to festivals and gigs \u2013 it\u2019s my time to unwind. I went paddle boarding at the weekend for the first time and loved it, even though I spent most of my time in the water rather than on top of it.\n\nI spend a lot on travel because my boyfriend lives in London and I work in Worcestershire. My train ticket to London costs \u00a340.55 with a 26-30 railcard. As my job involves travelling by car, I also spend about \u00a330 a week on petrol.\n\n\u2018Starting a business has made me a lot more frugal\u2019 Read more\n\nI haven\u2019t been abroad this year. My main holiday was a trip to Wales for the bank holiday, although saying that I do have a friend\u2019s birthday in Barcelona in November. I don\u2019t mind as I\u2019m quite fortunate to have gone travelling in the past.\n\nLooking to the future, I\u2019d say saving for a property is a priority for me. My parents told me it\u2019s better to invest in property \u2013 especially in the current economic climate where we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 so that\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on.\n\nAs told to Suzanne Bearne", "description": "Kath Bourne, 26, on how she manages to save despite her living costs \u2013 and her plans for the future", "authors": ["Suzanne Bearne"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34031b7d993985b24c77c66e832c70ef1e1c7701/0_0_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=129fecceaf55007fc9c640936e191565", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
