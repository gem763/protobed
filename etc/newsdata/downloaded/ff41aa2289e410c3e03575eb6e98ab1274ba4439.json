Hundreds of reported sightings only added to the mystery.\n\nIn 2015, a letter and photo of two of his sons, signed with his name and the message \"I am still alive\", was delivered to an AFP journalist but experts could not verify its authenticity.\n\nThe alleged killer evaded a police dragnet in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery.", "description": "French\u00a0authorities said on Saturday they were checking the identity of a man arrested in Scotland and believed to have vanished eight years ago following the murder of his wife and four children.
