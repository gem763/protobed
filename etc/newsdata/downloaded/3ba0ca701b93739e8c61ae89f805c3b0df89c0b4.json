Photo: YouTube\n\nOne Direction solo singles come in waves. Louis Tomlinson\u2019s out revisiting \u201990s neo-psych with his latest song \u201cKill My Mind,\u201d while Niall Horan\u2019s \u201cNice to Meet Ya\u201d plays its rave-happy twin, a bit of Stone Roses to supplement Louis\u2019s Oasis. Zayn Malik\u2019s digging deeper into electronics with \u201cRumors\u201d and \u201cTrampoline\u201d while Liam Payne\u2019s a Boogie Wit Da Hoodie collaboration \u201cStack It Up\u201d sustains his streak of sleek R&B tracks and team-ups with hit-makers in rap. The abrupt return of Harry Styles this week completes the 1D pentagon with the new song \u201cLights Up,\u201d a step back from the studious classic rock aesthetic powering his self-titled 2017 solo debut, in a manner of speaking.\n\n\u201cLights\u201d sounds like the kind of well-tailored pop the band would\u2019ve gotten to if it had a few more years to work with, but like Harry Styles, it\u2019s packed with organic flourishes, guitars galore, gorgeous piano notes scattered over top of the bridge and chorus, and a barely audible touch of what sounds like Mellotron, ground control saluting our fallen Major Tom. Styles was enthused about Van Morrison\u2019s Astral Weeks and Joni Mitchell\u2019s Blue in his most recent interview, both stripped and illuminating folk-rock classics, so there is the chance that the pure pop vibes here are a ringer for stiffer and starker music down the line. Time will tell.\n\nThe spiciest detail in all of this is the timing: It\u2019s National Coming Out Day in the States, where, for over 30 years, LGBTQ Americans have spoken their truths and celebrated their journeys. Much will be made of \u201cLights Up,\u201d its lyric about piercing the darkness in our hearts with radiant light, and its video, in part a steamy party with bodies gently jostling and caressing each other, where our protagonist snuggles with men and women and cruises through scenes lit sometimes subtly and sometimes not, with neon reds and pastel pinks and blues.\n\nStyles is the face of M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur, Gucci\u2019s new ageless and genderless fragrance, and has worn pieces created by gender-fluid British designer Harris Reed. Is this all just very tasteful signaling, or is it the model of how celebrities can use their platforms as allies and advocates? Does it matter which? Styles doesn\u2019t owe us more than he wants to tell us, and it\u2019s not wise to assume that pop lyrics come from personal experience. Come what may, \u201cLights Up\u201d is a breezy tune for the start of hoodie weather and an encouraging sentiment for a day about celebrating what makes all of us unique.", "description": "\u201cLights Up\u201d sounds like the kind of well-tailored pop One Direction would\u2019ve gotten to if it had a few more years to work with.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-harry-styles.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
