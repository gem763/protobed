Currey, who was one of the last three living World War II Medal of Honor recipients, has died at the age of 94.\n\nHe passed away Tuesday morning, according to his American legion post. The cause of his death has not been announced.\n\nSergeant Currey, of Selkirk, New York, enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 17 where he worked as a technical sergeant. Just one year later he'd become a hero for his courage in the famous Battle of the Bulge in Belgium.\n\nHe was given the Medal of Honor - the highest and most prestigious decoration of valor - for his valiant efforts in the Battle of the Bulge in Malmedy where on December 21, 1944 he rescued five Americans soldiers who were trapped in a building in the line of fire by German tanks. He was just 18 at the time.\n\nSergeant Francis Currey passed away on Tuesday morning at the age of 94.

Pictured above on July 26, 1945\n\nCurrey, an automatic rifleman, and his company were guarding a bridge crossing near Malmedy when German forces launched an attack and started to fire at a building where American troops were trapped inside.\n\nCurrey exposed himself to gunfire and fired a bazooka, an anti-tank rocket launcher weapon, at a German tank. He then shot three Germans.\n\nIn the attack, the German forces had their tanks destroyed and suffered heavy infantry casualties forcing them to withdraw.\n\nThen he ran to save the troops who were trapped inside a building and brought them to safety.\n\nHe was a sergeant with the Company K, 120th Infantry, 30th Infantry Division, fighting in Belgium in the 3rd Platoon and was just 18 at the time.\n\n'Through his extensive knowledge of weapons and by his heroic and repeated braving of murderous enemy fire, Sgt. Currey was greatly responsible for inflicting heavy losses in men and material on the enemy, for rescuing 5 comrades, 2 of whom were wounded, and for stemming an attack which threatened to flank his battalion's position,' a description of his valor listed on the Congressional Medal of Honor Society website says.\n\nSgt. Currey's bravery helped win the Battle that would pave the way for an Allied victory in the war, according to The Week.\n\nAmerican Legion Post 1040 announced his passing on Facebook on Tuesday writing: 'Sad news our Posts highest decorated member congressional medal of honor recipient \ufffcFrancis S Currey was called home to the lord, he passed\ufffc this morning'\n\nSergeant Currey, of Selkirk, New York, enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 17 where he worked as a technical sergeant.

He was just 18 at the time. Currey pictured above in 2009 at a Medal of Honor convention in Chicago\n\nHe was awarded the Silver Medal for his quick thinking and actions and later the Medal of Honor in 1945. After the war was over he was also awarded a Purple heart for being shot in Bavaria while disarming German soldiers.\n\nHe was New York state's last WWII Medal of Honor recipient.\n\nHis Medal of Honor wasn't just for his bravery and sacrifice, but for halting the advance of the enemy.\n\nThe Battle of the Bulge went down in history as the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during WWII. The battle stopped the advance of Axis powers into Western Europe and helped lead to an Allied victory.\n\nIn fact, his actions were credited with shortening the war by six weeks. If the Germans had made it across the bridge that day, they would have gained an advantage in the Western front.\n\nIn 1998, the first Medal of Honor G.I.
