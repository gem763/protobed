Her new self-titled autobiography, which hit bookshelves on Thursday, features 504 pages and 1,050 intimate photos, giving us a behind-the-scenes peek at her glamorous life.\n\nRihanna is the best-selling digital artist of all time.\n\nBy 2015, Rihanna had already released seven studio albums. 2012's \"Unapologetic\" was her first that debuted at No. 1 and won a Grammy for best urban contemporary album.\n\nHer \"Diamonds World Tour\" was the fifth-highest grossing tour of 2013.\n\nThe tour grossed $137,982,530, according to Billboard, or about R2 billion.\n\nShe is currently the world's richest female musician.\n\nWhile she's known to splurge on beauty, fashion, and vacations, Rihanna is heavily involved in charity work and was named Harvard's humanitarian of the year in 2017.\n\nShe's also a bonafide fashion icon.\n\nShe received the CFDA Fashion Icon award in 2014.\n\nHer autobiography includes plenty of photos taken during her downtime and \"off days.\"\n\nThe hardcover book includes a custom-designed black carton with a carrying handle.\n\nIt also includes behind-the-scenes images from Rihanna's iconic music videos and recording sessions.\n\nThe music video for \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" is widely assumed to be a public revenge fantasy against Rihanna's accountant, whom she sued for mismanaging her money and leaving her \"effectively bankrupt.\"\n\nThe video, which came out the year after her lawsuit was settled, explicitly names Rihanna's onscreen nemesis as \"The Accountant.\"\n\nRihanna's best friends are heavily featured throughout the book.\n\nMelissa Forde, who often makes appearances on Rihanna's Instagram, has been by the pop star's side since she moved from Barbados to America as a teenager.\n\nThe book will undoubtedly make fans even more anxious for new music.\n\n\"Anti,\" released in 2016, is Rihanna's most recent and most critically celebrated album.
