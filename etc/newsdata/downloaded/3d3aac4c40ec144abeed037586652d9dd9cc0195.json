Davis were \u2018so close\u2019 after sitcom ended", "language": "en", "text": "Maureen McCormick says she developed a strong bond with Ann B. Davis while on the set of \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d\n\nDavis, the comic actress best known for playing devoted housekeeper Alice Nelson on the hit \u201870s series, died in 2014 at age 88 after suffering a fall in her San Antonio home.\n\n'BRADY BUNCH' STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK RECALLS HER RELATIONSHIP WITH ON-SCREEN MOM FLORENCE HENDERSON\n\n\u201cGosh, we were so close,\u201d McCormick, who famously played Marcia Brady in the series, recently told Closer Weekly.\n\n\u201cWe used to fly to Texas and we would hang out and go out to dinner and we really spent a lot of time together \u2014 you know years after the show, and just admire her,\u201d McCormick continued.\n\nMcCormick told the outlet she also shared a loving relationship with her TV mom Florence Henderson.\n\n\u201cFlorence of course, we got very, very close, and spent really amazing moments together at the end,\u201d said McCormick. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful because they all taught me a lot and they\u2019ll always be with me.\u201d\n\n'BRADY BUNCH' STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK SLAMS ANTI-VAXXERS\n\nAt the time of Davis\u2019 death, McCormick said in a statement that the comic \u201cmade me a better person. How blessed I am to have had her in my life. She will be forever missed.\u201d\n\nDavis originally made her mark as the razor-tongued secretary on \u201cThe Bob Cummings Show,\u201d which earned her two Emmys. She appeared on that sitcom from 1955 until 1959. She went on to appear on \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d from 1969 until 1974.\n\n\u201cI know at least a couple hundred glamour gals who are starving in this time,\u201d Davis told the Los Angeles Times in 1955. \u201cI\u2019d rather be myself and eating.\u201d\n\nDavis said she told NBC photographers not to retouch their pictures of her, but they ignored her request and \u201cgave me eyebrows.\u201d\n\nMAUREEN MCCORMICK REVEALS SHE WANTED TO BUY THE ICONIC 'BRADY BUNCH' HOUSE\n\nIn her maid\u2019s uniform, Davis\u2019 character in \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d was constantly cleaning up messes big and small, and she was a mainstay of stability for her family.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m lovable,\u201d Davis told The Associated Press in 1993. \u201cI don\u2019t do anything to be lovable. I have no control.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Davis lived a quiet religious life long after \u201cThe Brady Bunch\" came to an end.\n\n\u201cI was born again,\u201d she told the outlet in 1993. \u201cIt happens to Episcopalians. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t hit you till you\u2019re 47 years old. It changed my whole life for the better... I spent a lot of time giving Christian witness all over the country to church groups and stuff.\u201d\n\n'BRADY BUNCH' CAST DISCUSSES ICONIC TV HOME\n\nDavis never married, saying she never found a man who was more interesting than her career.\n\n\u201cBy the time I started to get interested (in finding someone), all the good ones were taken,\u201d she told the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nLike Davis, Henderson left an undeniable impression on McCormick.\n\nBack in 2017, McCormick was one of 19 celebrities who participated in The American Heart Association\u2019s (AHA) Go Red For Women Red Dress Collection fashion show, which was presented by Macy\u2019s at New York City\u2019s Hammerstein Ballroom.\n\nFLORENCE HENDERSON WAS EXPECTED TO 'BOUNCE BACK' FROM ILLNESS\n\nThe annual show was created to raise awareness of heart disease among women. According to AHA, cardiovascular diseases cause one in three deaths among women each year \u2014 more than all cancers combined.\n\nGood heart health was also an important cause to Henderson, who participated in the event in 2016. As Carol Brady, the Hollywood veteran could solve any problem that arose in the Brady household, but in real life, she battled heart problems from a very young age \u2014 and they weren\u2019t as simple to resolve.\n\nHenderson passed away in 2016 at age 82 from congestive heart failure.\n\n\u201cFlorence had a heart disease issue from the time that she was a child,\u201d McCormick told Fox News in 2017. \u201cShe had a heart murmur and about a decade ago, she had something really frightening happened to her. She went into Cedars-Sinai in LA and they discovered a mitral valve leakage. And fortunately, they were able to revive her and repair her valve, instead of replacing it.\u201d\n\n'MARY TYLER MOORE' STAR TELLS ALL\n\nJust three days before her death, Henderson attended a taping of ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d to cheer on McCormick, who was participating in the dance competition series.\n\n\u201c[Florence was] a person who wanted to spread love and laughter,\u201d said McCormick about her friend. \u201cShe loved people, she loved life. She\u2019s born on Valentine\u2019s Day, how perfect, right? [She was] just a great woman. Someone I really admired.\u201d\n\nMcCormick was also grateful to have Henderson by her side during the grueling dance competition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always admired people that can dance and move their bodies,\u201d said McCormick on her involvement with \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve always thought, \u2018Oh, if only I can do that, wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u2019 But it\u2019s something I always thought I could not do. I was afraid to do it in public because I was afraid to look bad doing it. I was just afraid to be that vulnerable.\u201d\n\n'THE LOVE BOAT' STARS TELL ALL\n\nMcCormick had a message for women everywhere \u2014 one that the ever-doting Henderson would have approved.\n\n\u201cJust be careful, women,\u201d said McCormick. \u201cThis is the number one killer of women. Heart disease. Ask questions, go talk to your doctor, get all the tests and check-ups that we\u2019re supposed to do for cholesterol, and blood pressure, and blood sugar. Exercise a good amount. And eat right. And take care of yourself. Life is short, you know.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Maureen McCormick says she developed a strong bond with Ann B.
