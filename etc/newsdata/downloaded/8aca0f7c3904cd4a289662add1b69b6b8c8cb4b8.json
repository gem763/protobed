It does not apply in your home country, so she is liable \u2026 in her home country.\n\n\"That means the Dunn family can sue her in the United States for the explanation that they need to psychologically get closure on the first part of their grieving process and move on with the grieving process.\"\n\nMrs Sacoolas is the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to the UK, according to the US State Department.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe case took another twist on Saturday when it emerged Mr Raab had sent a letter to Harry's parents saying that \"immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home\".\n\nHe wrote: \"The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\n\n\"In these circumstances, Harry's case is now a matter for Northants police and the CPS to take forward.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done ... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\n\n\"We have looked at this very carefully ... the UK government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home.\"\n\nMr Dunn, Harry's father, told Sky News that the letter was \"excellent news\", adding: \"As we've said all along, we believed she didn't have immunity and we always believed it was just incorrect. This means so much to us.\"\n\nMrs Sacoolas' Volvo XC90 was travelling on the wrong side of the road when it collided with Harry, a petrol station cashier, as he rode his motorcycle in the small village of Croughton, where the RAF base is used by American intelligence personnel.\n\nA new \"keep left\" sign and road markings - arrows indicating the direction of travel - have since appeared close to the crash site.\n\nProsecutors have not said whether they would pursue charges.\n\nLast week, Chief Constable Nick Adderley, of Northamptonshire Police, said the force would treat Mrs Sacoolas like any other person wanted for questioning.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter raising the possibility of a civil case in a US court, Mr Stephens, Harry's family's spokesman and lawyer said it was \u201cless clear\u201d whether there would be a criminal case in the UK.\n\nHe said: \u201cNormally, Northamptonshire Police would put a case together, charge her and she would have said \u2018I have diplomatic immunity\u2019 and a court would have ruled.\n\n\u201cIn this case, quite unusually, she was spirited out of the country beyond the reaches of the British justice system, so they couldn\u2019t rule on whether she had diplomatic immunity.\u201d\n\nThe drama has caused \u201cuntold additional grief and hurt\u201d for Harry's family, according to the lawyer, who said it is hoped Mrs Sacoolas will return to the UK and \"submits to british justice\", despite later adding that the family \"aren't interested in the criminal side\".\n\nAfter the crash, Mrs Sacoolas and her family were flown out of the UK on a private flight that took off from RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk.\n\nHe said: \"The most important thing for the Dunn family is not really whether she is prosecuted or not. They need to see her, they need to talk to her about the last moments of their son\u2019s life so they can get closure.\"\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t give an explanation to them they could sue her in a US court to get one, he added.\n\nMr Stephens said Mrs Sacoolas' 10-year-old son was in the front passenger seat of her Volvo when the fatal collision happened, and it was no doubt a \"traumatic experience\" for the boy and \"tragic\" for her family.\n\nMrs Sacoolas' legal team has said she wanted to meet Harry's parents to \"express her deepest sympathies and apologies\".\n\nHer legal representative, Amy Jeffress, said: \"Anne is devastated by this tragic accident.\n\n\"No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn's family.\"\n\nHarry's family's spokesman, Radd Seiger, said he had spoken with Ms Jeffress and the pair had agreed \"to get together asap ... to discuss how we are going to achieve a solution\".\n\nHe told NBC News: \"I have had a brief conversation with the legal representatives appointed on behalf of Anne Sacoolas and we have agreed to meet at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier, Mrs Sacoolas's lawyer said: \"Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn's parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident.\n\n\"We have been in contact with the family's attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\"\n\nThe lawyer said Mrs Sacoolas spoke with \"authorities\" at the scene of the crash and met Northampton police at her home the following day.\n\n\"She will continue to cooperate with the investigation,\" she said.\n\nOn Friday, the Prime Minister said America was \"absolutely ruthless\" in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity.\n\nBoris Johnson said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Harry's family's views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US is \"very reluctant\" to allow citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nMr Trump had said last week that he spoke to Mr Johnson about the case and the American woman was the subject of diplomatic immunity.\n\nSpeaking of taking their campaign to the US, Mr Dunn's family said in a statement that they \"continue to live in a nightmare\" and have so far been unable to grieve after his death.", "description": "Crash suspect Anne Sacoolas - reportedly married to a US intelligence official - flew home to America after Harry Dunn, 19, was killed outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Benjamin Cooper", "Luke Powell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Harry-Dunn-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
