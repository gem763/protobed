They won this game despite missing a number of key players with injury and, for that alone, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r can probably accept the fact their performance never got any higher than six out of 10 \u2013 there was lots of huffing and puffing but none of the old panache.\n\nLeicester certainly had enough of the ball to believe they ought to have extended United\u2019s winless sequence to four matches. Ultimately, though, Solskj\u00e6r and his players can reflect on a decent afternoon\u2019s work bearing in mind Leicester have ambitions of their own to break into the Premier League\u2019s top four.\n\nTammy Abraham scores hat-trick and own goal as Chelsea hammer Wolves Read more\n\nMarcus Rashford\u2019s seventh-minute penalty was the game\u2019s decisive moment and, in particular, it must have been a satisfying day for Harry Maguire given the Leicester supporters, for reasons not particularly clear, spent large parts of the afternoon targeting their former player with a very unflattering chant. Maguire played well, winning his personal battle with Jamie Vardy, and Solskj\u00e6r was entitled to feel happy about the commitment of his team. It was certainly one of Andreas Pereira\u2019s better games for the club. Daniel James showed some nice touches and Rashford was always a difficult opponent. United might have provided reminders of their flaws at times but, if nothing else, nobody could doubt their determination.\n\nIn the process Rashford also demonstrated they have not completely forgotten the art of taking a penalty kick. With Paul Pogba among the absentees, at least there was no debate about who should take this one. Both players had missed one in United\u2019s opening fixtures and, in those circumstances, Rashford could probably have been forgiven if he felt slightly apprehensive approaching the ball. He did not give that impression, steering his kick to Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s left as the goalkeeper shaped to go the other way.\n\nSadio Man\u00e9 double gives Liverpool comeback win after Newcastle scare Read more\n\nAnthony Martial\u2019s absence meant Rashford was given a role through the middle. It is the position Gareth Southgate says does not bring out the best in the player but, while there may be something in that argument, it was also Rashford\u2019s alertness in the area that led to the penalty. Caglar Soyuncu did not seem to realise how speedily his opponent was going to get across to the ball and, as soon as Rashford got there ahead of him, it was always likely the attacking player would go over the defender\u2019s trailing foot. The VAR replays confirmed Soyuncu had clipped him and Pereira also deserves a mention for the sliding tackle on Hamza Choudury that turned the ball into the penalty area.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rashford scores from the penalty spot.

James Maddison had a chance to punish United for some poor defending but it took a while before Leicester, having gone behind, started to attack again with the potency that might have been expected. When they did, however, it must have been startling for the United crowd to see how quickly their own players lost momentum. Ben Chilwell\u2019s volley brought a flying save from David de Gea and there was enough danger for the home team to realise a difficult second half lay ahead.\n\nSure enough, Leicester started it brightly but, for all their possession, they never found a pass to release Vardy. The onslaught that might have been anticipated in the final 20 minutes never really materialised. Rashford struck the angle of crossbar and post from a free-kick and the afternoon concluded with the Stretford End singing Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cWe want to play better than this,\u201d the manager said. \u201cOf course we want to dominate games but sometimes you play against a team that plays well and I thought we rode out the threat well.\u201d", "description": "Marcus Rashford scored the only goal after eight minutes from the penalty spot as an uninspired Manchester United beat Leicester 1-0 at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Daniel Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54030317686530985081212f07a795179b867014/0_11_3424_2055/master/3424.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e104d08e04a5d9f73dd32865c9587ab", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
