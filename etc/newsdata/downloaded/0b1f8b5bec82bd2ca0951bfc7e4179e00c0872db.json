That's what it is. This is one of the great con jobs ever. We must never let it happen to another president. This should never be allowed to happen again,\" he told his crowd of supporters.\n\nIn a closed-door hearing yesterday, former Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers that she was recalled earlier this year after \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d against her -- as well as continued pressure from President Trump on the State Department to remove her -- as she denied being \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the president.\n\nYovanovitch is not the only diplomat who will face lawmakers in the coming days.
