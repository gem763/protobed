However, his comments came after the close of the poll.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come at a time when optimism has been growing that a deal may be reached due to ongoing trade talks and political considerations ahead of elections next year in the United States.\n\nShort bets on the Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS, the South Korean won KRW=KFTC and the Singapore dollar SGD= declined for the second time in a month, but the unpredictable nature of the last 15 months has kept market participants slightly apprehensive.\n\n\u201cKnowing the history of the talks between the two giants, the market is also prudent not to get carried away with the odds of a trade deal,\u201d said Mahesh Sethuraman, deputy head of global sales trading at Saxo Capital Markets.\n\nJust this week Trump leveled sharp criticism of China\u2019s trade practices and said he would not accept a \u201cbad\u201d trade deal.\n\nDisruptions caused by the trade war have seen a growing need for supply chain diversification, driving more business toward Taiwan, whose hi-tech factories are suppliers for global tech giants such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O).\n\nLast week, the island raised its 2019 growth forecast to 2.4% from 2.06%.\n\nInvestors cut their bearish bets on the Indian rupee INR=IN for a second time this month, as the government unveiled a series of measures to reinvigorate the economy.\n\nLast week, India lowered its corporate taxes in a surprise move to woo manufacturers and boost investment in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy, where unemployment has surged as growth sinks to a six-year low.\n\nInvestors raised their long bets on the Thai baht THB=TH, the only other emerging Asian currency where they were bullish, even as the country struggles with shrinking exports and below-target inflation.\n\nThe central bank has expressed concern about the strength of the baht, which has gained nearly 6.5% against the U.S. dollar - making it Asia\u2019s best performing currency so far this year.\n\nShort positions on the Philippine pesos PHP= were marginally reduced. Later in the day, the central bank is expected to cut interest rates for a third time this year.\n\nThe Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.\n\nThe poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.\n\nThe figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).", "description": "Investors scaled back short positions on currencies of trade-reliant Asian economies over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as optimism grew that the United States and China would clinch a trade deal at some level.", "authors": ["Nikhil Nainan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434031039&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0C2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
