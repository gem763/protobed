He still has scheduled performances in Europe.\n\nThe withdrawals and cancellations occurred after several women within the industry came forward in August with allegations of sexual misconduct against the opera superstar, some dating back to the 1980s. Eight singers and one dancer told The Associated Press that Domingo had a history of pressuring women into sexual relationships in exchange for jobs, and would sometimes punish women professionally if they refused his advances. Nearly three dozen people in the industry told AP they witnessed Domingo behaving inappropriately toward younger women.\n\nIn September, 11 additional women came forward with new allegations that for years they\u2019ve experienced unwanted touching, attempted kissing, phone calls late at night and repeated pressuring for private get-togethers from Domingo. That report put the number of accusers at 20.\n\nDomingo, who for decades has been considered one of the most powerful men in opera, has denied the allegations in the past, calling them both \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\nThe American Guild of Musical Artists, a union representing opera singers, announced last month that it has launched an independent investigation into the allegations. The LA Opera said in August that it had hired outside counsel to investigate the allegations.\n\nThe executive committee of the LA Opera board of directors released a statement Wednesday in response to Domingo\u2019s resignation, saying his \u201ccontributions to the cultural life of Los Angeles have been unprecedented and profound.\u201d Domingo gave more than 300 performances in 31 different roles during his time at the opera, according to the committee.\n\n\u201cWe thank Pl\u00e1cido for popularizing opera in the consciousness of Los Angeles and are deeply grateful for his inspiration and dedication to our institution and our community,\u201d the committee said.", "description": "The opera superstar's resignation as the Los Angeles Opera's general director came after 20 people within the industry accused him of sexual harassment.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d95066e210000a80251a124.jpeg?cache=qte6jiod6z&ops=1778_1000"}
