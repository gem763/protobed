That curiously came after his trade request. Players get injured all the time in the NFL and it\u2019s likely coincidental timing. However, it\u2019s easy to question it. The same thing happened when Ramsey missed a couple days at the facility with the flu after requesting the trade.\n\nOn Sunday, Ramsey wasn\u2019t with his teammates as they lost to the host Carolina Panthers. He was in Houston reportedly to visit a back specialist. He also found time to hang out with Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s not the best look.\n\nRamsey hangs with Watson\n\nRamsey is a grownup and it\u2019s not unusual for great players to be friendly, even as division rivals. Watson and Ramsey share an agent. Ramsey\u2019s appointment with the back specialist is Monday, the Houston Chronicle said, and Ramsey passed the time Sunday by hanging out with a friend and his agent.\n\nStill, the Jaguars couldn\u2019t have been thrilled to see this after their 34-27 loss to the Panthers ...\n\nUnless someone did a heck of an editing job, that picture is from Sunday afternoon, based on the Cowboys-Packers game behind them. That would be about two hours after the Texans won and the Jaguars lost. The players\u2019 agent, David Mulugheta, is between the two stars.\n\nAgain, nothing Ramsey did is wrong in a vacuum. It just looks strange considering his standing trade request.\n\nJaguars don\u2019t want to trade Ramsey\n\nStory continues\n\nRamsey requested a trade after he said disrespectful things were told to him after a Week 2 game. He said his relationship with the front office is the reason he wants to be traded. Jaguars owner Shad Khan said he doesn\u2019t plan to trade the All-Pro cornerback.\n\nThat social-media picture of Ramsey in Houston shortly after the Jaguars\u2019 loss, with the quarterback of Jacksonville\u2019s division rival, isn\u2019t necessarily a message. But it\u2019s easy to connect dots.\n\nThe Ramsey standoff doesn\u2019t have an end in sight yet. And we\u2019ll probably get a little more drama along the way.\n\nJacksonville cornerback Jalen Ramsey was in Houston on Sunday.
