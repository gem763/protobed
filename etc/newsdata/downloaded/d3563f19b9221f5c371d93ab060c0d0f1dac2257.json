According to a report in the Washington Post, Trump has finally swung to the opposite end of the spectrum, seeking counsel from sources hoping to undermine U.S. foreign interests. Two trusted sources for forming his opinion on Ukraine were regional authoritarians with open hostility for the administration in Kiev: Hungary\u2019s President Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAccording to intelligence officials who spoke to the Post \u2014 and the closed-door testimony of State Department deputy assistant secretary George Kent \u2014 Trump consulted the pair in May, shortly after the election of Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky, to gauge the leaders\u2019 feelings on his fellow entertainer turned politician:\n\nIn a May 3 call, Trump asked Putin about his impressions of Zelensky, according to a Western official familiar with the conversation. Putin said that he had not yet spoken with Zelensky but derided him as a comedian with ties to an oligarch despised by the Kremlin \u2026 The May conversation with Putin coincided with a White House visit by Orban that many in the administration had opposed because of the Hungarian leader\u2019s moves to undercut democratic institutions in that country and his combative relations with U.S. allies in Europe \u2026 Senior U.S. diplomats said they had limited insight into the private conversation between Trump and Orban, let alone how Trump\u2019s views of Ukraine have formed. But one official familiar with the encounter said that it became \u201cclear that the meeting with Orban had solidified\u201d Trump\u2019s pessimistic view about Kyiv and Zelensky.\n\nThe officials who spoke with the Post mention that though Orb\u00e1n and Putin disparaged Ukraine, they did not tell Trump to withhold aid in exchange for damaging information on a political rival \u2014 in the way that that good mentor sets you up with a road map for success, but not with step-by-step directions. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision to seek damaging material on Biden was more directly driven by Trump\u2019s own impulses and Kyiv conspiracy theories promoted by his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani,\u201d the Post states.\n\nThe president\u2019s seeking of advice in all the wrong places is disconcerting on an immediate level, as Trump continues to conveniently align foreign policy with Russian interests. But confiding in Putin and Orb\u00e1n \u2014 who successfully clamped down on press freedom, stoked anti-immigrant fears, and carved a barbed-wire fence into Hungary\u2019s southern border \u2014 shows just how deep Trump\u2019s autocratic desires are. \u201cI can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that [Trump] would love to have the situation that Viktor Orb\u00e1n has, but he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Trump\u2019s ambassador to Hungary, David Cornstein, told the Atlantic in June. You are the Eastern European company you keep.\n\nTrump\u2019s autocratic friends also reveal just how vulnerable the administration is to the president\u2019s unofficial advisers, as he prioritizes Giuliani-pushed conspiracies and big-picture recommendations from anti-democratic leaders. \u201cOver time you just see a wearing down of the defenses,\u201d a former White House official told the Post, adding that the Orb\u00e1n-Putin rec is \u201can example of the president himself under malign influence \u2014 being steered by it.\u201d Democrats agree: Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that the president\u2019s actions \u201c threaten our national security.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s early opinion on Ukrainian President Zelensky was reportedly influenced by the negative recommendation by Hungarian President Viktor Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/trump_putin.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
