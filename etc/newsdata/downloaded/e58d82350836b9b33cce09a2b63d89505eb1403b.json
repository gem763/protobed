At least that's what it seems when he turns them into a scapegoat for mass shootings in the US. And yet he's just joined Twitch, Amazon's popular game livestreaming platform.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nIn a single day his account has received a verification mark, and has gathered close to 46,000 followers. The channel has only streamed once so far, a feed of his rally in Minneapolis, but it seems to have been enough for his fans.\n\nBy the looks of it Trump's media team will be using the platform to livestream his rallies to a larger audience, as part of his 2020 re-election bid. He's not the first political candidate by any stretch to attempt this. Democrats Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang have both done that as well.\n\nWe've already seen how much Trump uses Twitter, having turned it into his own personal pulpit over the last few years. That he would move to Twitch to do this again is ironic. Though the platform has IRL (real life vlog) sections and other stuff, it's primarily a place to watch people play video games. You know, the thing he's railed against after mass shootings, in lieu of implementing gun control laws.\n\nDon't Miss 12.9 K SHARES 445 SHARES 142 SHARES 282 SHARES\n\nIt's also ironic because Twitch belongs to Amazon, which bought the platform for $970 million in 2014. And Trump has repeatedly attempted to attack the company in th erecent past, accusing it of taking advantage of its delivery partnership with the US Postal Service. Trump has also personally attacked CEO Jeff Bezos, likely because the tech magnate also owns The Washington Post, which has no qualms about publishing reports critical of the US president.\n\nThen again, maybe Trump is hoping none of his supporters on Twitch will remember that he criticized their favourite pastime.", "description": "Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been a fan of video games in the least.
