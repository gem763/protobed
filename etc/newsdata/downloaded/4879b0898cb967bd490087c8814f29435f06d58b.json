I saw this big white flash when I hit the floor and I thought, \u201cYou\u2019ve finally done it now\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I knew it was bad, I thought I was paralysed, so very calmly I said, \u201cSharon, I can\u2019t move. I think I\u2019ve done my neck. Phone an ambulance\u201d. \u2018\n\nThe musician underwent three separate operations that left him in hospital for three months.\n\nHe wondered if Sharon was keeping it secret (Picture: WireImage)\n\nOzzy was in \u2018constant\u2019 pain, and even believed his wife was lying to him when she said he wasn\u2019t going to die.\n\nHe added to Daily Mail\u2019s Weekend magazine: \u2018The pain is constant. The first six months I was in agony. I\u2019d say, \u201cSharon \u2013 you\u2019re not telling me the truth. I\u2019m dying, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I thought I\u2019d got some terminal illness because the improvement was so slow.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m getting better, but after the surgery the nurses asked me on a scale of one to ten how much pain I was in, and I said, \u201c55!\u201d Six months of waking up in the morning and being unable to move is a miserable existence.\u2019\n\nThankfully the War Pigs hitmaker is on the mend following his scary year, but he\u2019s joked he already has his funeral planned.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve cheated death many times and I\u2019ve got away with it for years, yet since I hit 70 everything\u2019s happened. But then I thought I\u2019d be dead by 40, so I\u2019ve still got a few of my nine lives yet,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018When I die and they\u2019re nailing the lid on my coffin. I\u2019m thinking of having them play a recording of my voice at the service, shouting, \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet!\u201d That\u2019ll scare them!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOzzy had previously had to pushed back dates on the UK and European leg of his No More Tours 2 tour. Originally planned for this year, after being hospitalised with pneumonia and a subsequent fall in January, he had to tweak the date.\n\nAfter rescheduling the concerts to take place between January 2020 and March 2020, earlier this month he was forced to postpone due to needing more time to recover from the surgery he underwent.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
