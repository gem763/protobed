In addition, the family has also pledged to contribute at least $3 billion to the settlement.\n\nDrain said the public deserves an accounting of the company\u2019s role in the crisis, which has led to some 400,000 deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to U.S. statistics.\n\nHowever, he said he feared a \u201ctrial becomes an autopsy\u201d that destroys the value of Purdue, adding that most trials leave many unresolved questions.\n\n\u201cThere are trials where people stand up and say \u2018I did it.\u2019 But that mostly happens on Perry Mason,\u201d he said, referring to the popular TV show from the 1950s and \u201860s featuring a lawyer who won virtually every case.\n\nDrain also urged the parties to determine the best way to divvy up the settlement proceeds, echoing comments he had made on Thursday.", "description": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP won a court order on Friday briefly pausing the sprawling opioid litigation against the company so it can try to make headway on its proposed legal settlement that it says is worth $10 billion.", "authors": ["Tom Hals", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439804527&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0ZI", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
