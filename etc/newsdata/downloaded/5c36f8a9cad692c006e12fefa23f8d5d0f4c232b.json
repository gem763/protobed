A majority of the other 14 officers were named during their federal trial, though most of the additional officers have not been charged with a crime.\n\nThe newspaper said that three of the additional officers remain on the force, including a detective and two sergeants, citing confirmation from a department spokesman. One of the three has been suspended.\n\nThe police department didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email Friday from the Associated Press seeking comment on the officers who remain on the force.\n\nMosby said in an email to the newspaper that \u201cour legal and ethical obligation in the pursuit of justice leaves us no other recourse but to \u2018right the wrongs\u2019 of unjust convictions associated with corrupt police officers.\u201d\n\nOf the eight Baltimore officers sentenced to prison for racketeering charges, six accepted plea deals and two were convicted. Officers admitted to stealing money from people, lying in police paperwork and claiming unearned overtime pay. Officers found guilty also testified about potential wrongdoing by additional police officers who haven\u2019t been charged.\n\nProsecutors spent more than a year reviewing thousands of arrests by the task force and identified the 790, most of which are older cases in which the defendants have already been released.\n\nWith expanded authorities under a new state law, Mosby\u2019s staff will file 200 cases a week, with judges holding daily hearings to consider erasing bad convictions.\n\n\u201cIt is still very early in the process, and we are hopeful for the swift vacatur of all of the many tainted convictions,\u201d said Melissa Rothstein, spokeswoman for the Baltimore public defender\u2019s office.\n\nCity Solicitor Andre Davis has said he\u2019s concerned that many defendants could file lawsuits against the city.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baltimore's top prosecutor has begun asking judges to throw out nearly 800 convictions that she said were tainted by officers linked to a corruption scandal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/Baltimore_Police_Corruption_75981.jpg-9da2e_c0-0-3580-2087_s1770x1032.jpg?d40128b79f7144fce1870a222d446420cef8595f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
