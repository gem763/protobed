Here are 5 real ways to get rich", "language": "en", "text": "Too many people out there are offering ridiculous ideas on how you can become rich. Many of those ideas are about cutting back.\n\nI can promise you that will not get rich by skipping your daily latte.\n\nLook, if you don't have income, then there is no money to save. Don't let anyone give you the idea that you need to skip your Starbucks coffee and save $5 a day and that will somehow turn into a fortune.\n\nMaybe you can skip spending $5 at Starbucks every day and save $10,000 over the next five years, but if you think $10,000 is going to change your life, you're not just broke, you're being stupid. Of course you should spend less than you earn, but if you make $50,000 a year with a couple of kids, what money is there left over to save?\n\nIf you are serious about getting rich, you need to get your mind focused on income. Increase your income enough and you will be able to save something substantial.\n\nHere are five non-fiction tips you can use that will actually get you to millionaire status:\n\n1. Invest in you\n\nSuccessful people invest time, energy, and money in improving themselves. A man told me once, \"The best way you can help people in need is to not be someone in need.\" Help yourself out so you are in a position to help someone else out. This means investing in yourself to become great at something.\n\nI invested in sales training when I was 25. That made my income-producing ability skyrocket. Investing in yourself is the best investment you can make.", "description": "Entrepreneur Grant Cardone explains why your focus should be on earning, not saving, in the new year.", "authors": ["Grant Cardone", "Sebastian Derungs", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/07/16/102839759-starbucks.1910x1000.jpg", "published_at": "2017-01-05"}
