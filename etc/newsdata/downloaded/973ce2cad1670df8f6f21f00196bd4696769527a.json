The long-term survival of Forever 21 relies on the chain creating a sustainable and differentiated brand\u2019.\n\nIn a statement, the firm said filing for voluntary bankruptcy was a \u2018deliberate and decisive step to put us on a successful track for the future\u2019.\n\nCommonly known as a \u2018reorganisation\u2019 bankruptcy, the move will allow the fast fashion brand to keep control and possession of its assets while restructuring is carried out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReductions of up to 50 per cent are on offer in the Oxford Street store, including on brand new stock.\n\nThe firm have not announced on what date the store will be closing.\n\nIts third UK store, in Birmingham, remains open.\n\nIt risks becoming the latest high street casualty after shops like Debenhams went into administration in Spring Picture: Jack Dredd/Rex Features)\n\nThe firm has about 800 stores globally, with around 178 stores set to close in the US.\n\nIn the same month Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy, US pop star Ariana Grande sued the retailer for using her trademark style to promote its products without her permission, including adverts featuring a \u2018look-alike model.\u2019\n\nThe lawsuit, seeking $10million, claims the campaign was intended to trick consumers into believing Grande had endorsed Forever 21\u2019s products.\n\nIf it closes all UK stores, it will join a growing list of retailers in Britain that have wobbled or collapsed outright in recent years.\n\nHigh-profile failures include Debenhams, L.K.Bennett , House of Fraser and Coast.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
