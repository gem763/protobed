It follows an \u201cABC\u201d formula that workers can be considered independent contractors (A) only if the workers are \u201cfree from the control and direction\u201d of the company that hired them, (B) their work falls outside the usual business of the company and (C) they are engaged in work in an independent business of the same type as the company\u2019s.\n\nIt makes exceptions for certain groups of workers, including real estate agents, freelance writers, hairstylists and barbers who set their own rates and hours.\n\nThe language of the bill is based on a 2018 California Supreme Court decision in the case of Dynamex Operations, which established the ABC test for classifying workers as employees versus contractors.\n\n\u201cThe misclassification of workers as independent contractors has been a significant factor in the erosion of the middle class and the rise in income inequality,\u201d the bill says.\n\nMajor tech companies such as Uber and Lyft, whose hordes of drivers are currently considered independent contractors, have been lobbying against the legislation. Their companies\u2019 bottom lines would be dramatically affected by having thousands of drivers newly classified as employees for whom they\u2019d have to pay certain benefits, overtime, minimum wages and more.\n\nHundreds of Uber and Lyft drivers with the organizing group Gig Workers Rising protested throughout California in late August, demanding AB-5\u2019s passage and a union for drivers.\n\nJustin Sullivan via Getty Images Rideshare drivers hold signs during a protest outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco in support of California labor legislation and a union push.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates have come out in support of the bill and workers\u2019 demands, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cAmerican history is full of shameful examples where powerful industries exploited workers in pursuit of greater profits,\u201d Warren wrote in an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee in August. \u201cIn many industries today, it takes the form of worker misclassification.\u201d\n\nExactly how the law would affect rideshare companies and their drivers when applied in practice is still unclear. Uber, Lyft and other companies have committed tens of millions of dollars to back a ballot initiative that would push a separate classification for rideshare drivers.\n\nThe heads of Uber and Lyft have argued for workers to remain as independent contractors, suggesting that as employees they wouldn\u2019t enjoy as much flexibility and proposing that the companies could meet some of the workers\u2019 demands by establishing a drivers\u2019 association and working with lawmakers to commit to things like minimum pay.\n\nDriver-led group Gig Workers Rising called the tech leaders\u2019 proposals \u201ca watered-down version\u201d of the demands drivers have been making for months. One organizer, Annette Rivero, told TechCrunch that there was \u201cno truth\u201d to the companies\u2019 claim that the legislation would affect drivers\u2019 flexibility.\n\n\u201cAfter I did my taxes, I was operating below minimum wage,\u201d driver and organizer Mostafa Maklad, 35, told HuffPost during protests at Uber\u2019s headquarters in May. He\u2019s been driving for Uber and Lyft for the past four years, studying at City College of San Francisco by day and driving 40 to 50 hours a week by night. Maklad said he struggles to afford housing in San Francisco and lives with six other people in a two-bedroom apartment.", "description": "If signed by the governor, the legislation would force tech companies to reclassify independent contractors as employees and provide them with additional...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6844112500004b04746870.jpeg?cache=94qsmpmzfi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
