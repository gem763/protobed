He\u2019s in a crippling trade war with China, with talks scheduled but no end in sight. Gun legislation is stuck in neutral. The USMCA could have a chance, but just this week Speaker NANCY PELOSI told Canadian PM JUSTIN TRUDEAU she\u2019s still worried about enforcement mechanisms. Infrastructure spending seems like a distant memory, and a running joke.\n\nTHE MAN who ran in 2016 as a candidate who could bend feeble politicians to his will has been forced to raid funding for things like military day-care centers to build his wall on the southern border with Mexico. The spending cut package that some of his advisers proposed had to be pared back, after high-level complaints from Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO, among others. And if the economy sours, he will lose his No. 1 talking point: that he\u2019s presided over boom times unlike any era in American history.\n\nON A14 \u2026 NYT\u2019S MICHAEL CROWLEY: \u201cTrump Heads Into 2020 With No Clear Policy Agenda. But It May Not Matter.\u201d\n\n\u2026 BUT! WAPO: \u201cChina, U.S. to resume trade talks in Washington in October,\u201d by Gerry Shih in Beijing: \u201cChina said Thursday its trade representatives will fly to Washington in early October to resume negotiations with the United States, raising the possibility that both sides might arrest a recent deterioration in the bilateral relationship that has cast a shadow over the world economy.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, agreed to the October visit in a phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. It added that \u2018serious\u2019 mid-level discussions will begin in mid-September to prepare for the October visit.\n\n\u201cThe announcement marks the first sign that talks are getting back on track after both governments raised tariffs last month and engaged in a rhetorical back-and-forth that underscored the adversarial mood settling over the two capitals on a range of issues extending well beyond trade. At one point, President Trump ordered American companies to leave China.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- WSJ: \u201cGlobal Stocks Rally on New Trade Talks,\u201d by Caitlin Ostroff and Joanne Chiu: \u201cAsian stocks soared on the prospect of fresh negotiations, as well as hopes for monetary easing in China. Stocks in Japan and South Korea, both of whose economies have been sensitive to the trade dispute, shot higher, with the Nikkei 225 up 2.1% and the Kospi up 0.8%. The Shanghai Composite rose 1%.\n\n\u201cHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was an outlier in the region with a 0.5% drop, but it still held on to most of the previous day\u2019s gains that came after the city\u2019s leader withdrew the extradition bill that had caused months of unrest.\u201d WSJ\n\nSIREN -- ALEX ISENSTADT: \u201cRepublicans fear Democrats poised to dominate next round of redistricting\u201d: \u201cDemocrats were caught napping before the last round of redistricting in 2010 \u2014 and it cost them control of Congress for nearly a decade. Now Republicans are warning the same thing could happen to them.\n\n\u201cSenior Republicans concede they\u2019re at risk of losing dozens of state-level elections that will determine who wields power over the post-2020 congressional map \u2014 and potentially which party controls the chamber for the following 10 years. While Republicans are establishing a massive national infrastructure devoted to reelecting President Donald Trump and winning congressional majorities, party officials say the state legislative races are being overlooked.\n\n\u201cThe trepidation comes as an array of well-funded Democratic groups \u2014 including one with the backing of former President Barack Obama and ex-Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 are flooding cash into Virginia, a key redistricting battleground that\u2019s holding state legislative elections this fall. Democrats are expected to plow tens of millions into races next year.\u201d POLITICO\n\nIT KEEPS COMING! \u2026 THE NRCC reported another $500,000 in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, where Democrat Dan McCready is trying to beat Republican Dan Bishop.

The earliest filing deadline is in November. Lawmakers have lots of time to wring their hands and mull their future in Congress.\n\n-- ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST: \u201cRep. Jim Sensenbrenner won't seek reelection next year,\u201d by Steven Shepard: \u201cRep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the second-longest serving member of the House, announced Wednesday he won\u2019t seek reelection next year. Sensenbrenner, who was first elected in the 1978 midterms, joins more than a dozen other House Republicans who have already announced their retirements. He was the third member from either party on Wednesday alone to say they wouldn\u2019t run again in 2020, joining Reps. Bill Flores (R-Texas) and Susan Davis (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cAnd while Sensenbrenner\u2019s Milwaukee-area district leans heavily Republican \u2014 President Donald Trump won 57 percent of the vote there in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 it\u2019s yet another sign that Republicans are pessimistic about their chances to win back the House majority next year. Sensenbrenner won reelection in 2018 with 62 percent of the vote. In his congressional career, he never won less than 60 percent of the vote in a general election.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- REPUBLICANS TO WATCH FOR THIS SEAT, per a plugged-in Wisconsin Republican: Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson, both of whom vied for the Senate last cycle; state Rep.

As of early Thursday over 16,800 in Charleston County and over 6,800 in Beaufort County were without power, according to Dominion Energy.

At least three people were killed and another 30 wounded, a hospital director said.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they targeted three vehicles of \u2018foreigners\u2019 as they tried to enter the heavily guarded Shashdarak area where the Afghan national security authorities have offices. It was the second major blast by the militant group in Kabul this week while a U.S. envoy has been in town briefing officials on a U.S.-Taliban deal \u2018in principle\u2019 to end America\u2019s longest war.\u201d AP\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

But Democrats say they want to see the records from inside the department, particularly as the Judiciary Committee considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cDemocrats seize on climate as 2020 primary weapon,\u201d by David Siders and Zack Colman: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the debate that climate activists wanted. But one marathon stretch of climate forums on Wednesday nevertheless marked a sharp turn in the 2020 presidential contest. In seven hours on CNN, the leading Democratic candidates showed the first signs of weaponizing climate change in the primary campaign.\n\n\u201cProdding one another across televised segments and, by proxy, through the network\u2019s moderators, Sen. Bernie Sanders pressed more moderate Democrats on a proposal to ban hydraulic fracturing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for weaning the nation off nuclear power, while former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 while fielding criticism about his fundraising \u2014 cast his international experience as instrumental in getting the \u2018rest of the world to come along\u2019 on climate.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cNew Hampshire power brokers paralyzed by size of Democratic field,\u201d by Trent Spiner in Manchester, N.H.: \u201cIf the Democratic race has effectively narrowed to three top candidates and everyone else, elected officials here haven\u2019t gotten the message: Some 95 percent of them, from members of the statehouse down to town party chairmen, have yet to pick a horse.\n\n\u201cDemocratic presidential hopefuls are waging a fierce behind-the-scenes battle to get them off the sidelines \u2014 amid a prevailing sense that the first-in-the-nation primary is up for grabs.

It first blocked his plans to leave the union with or without an agreement.

It is keeping base gyms and fitness centers open all night. But its sailors keep getting fatter: A new Defense Department study found that 22 percent of them \u2014 roughly one in every five \u2014 now qualifies as obese.\n\n\u201cThe Navy\u2019s figure is the highest, but the study found striking rises in obesity rates in the other armed services as well, even though the Pentagon has rolled out one strategy after another in recent years to try to keep the troops trim.

Schools for the children of U.S. military members from Kentucky to Germany to Japan will be affected.
