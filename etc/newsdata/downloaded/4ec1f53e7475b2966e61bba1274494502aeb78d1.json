The bulk of that activity comes from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises which the Treasury Department seized during the 2008 financial crisis to avert catastrophic losses.\n\nEnding government control of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 a goal of lawmakers from both parties almost since they were taken over \u2014 is at the center of the proposal. The two companies do not make home loans; rather, they buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them as guaranteed securities to sell to investors. That frees the lenders to make more loans, boosting the market and making borrowing more affordable.\n\nAlthough Treasury outlined recommendations for legislation to overhaul the way the companies operate, it plans to release the companies with or without Congress, which is unlikely to take up comprehensive housing finance reform anytime soon because the issue is so divisive.\n\n\u201cWhile Treasury prefers legislation, further reform should not and need not wait on Congress,\u201d a senior Treasury official told reporters Thursday.\n\nThat stance will draw protests from lawmakers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Democrats, who want to ensure that housing affordability is the top priority in any overhaul.\n\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Still, it left many of the details of releasing the companies \u2014 such as the capital levels they would need and what would happen to Treasury\u2019s holdings in the companies \u2014 to be hashed out in talks with their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, starting this fall.\n\nThose details, the official said, \u201care left to the recapitalization plan. As a result, I think it would be a bad assumption by any of the various interested parties to try to assume how they would fare under that recapitalization plan.\u201d\n\nFHFA is expected to release a rule on Fannie and Freddie\u2019s capital requirements this fall, a condition of their release.\n\nRight now, the companies are each allowed a $3 billion capital cushion \u2014 the rest of their profits are swept to Treasury each quarter.\n\nThat could change as soon as this year: \u201cTreasury and FHFA should consider moving up the capital buffers, so that could be a near-term\u201d action, the Treasury official said.\n\nThe blueprint would also limit Fannie and Freddie\u2019s activities to reduce their share of the market, though it does not specify a target market share. The companies would be able to hold fewer mortgages on their books, for instance.\n\nBut the Trump administration would preserve a requirement that Fannie and Freddie serve rural markets.\n\nMore ambitious reforms require congressional action. Treasury\u2019s legislative proposals include creating an explicit catastrophic government guarantee.\n\n\u201cAlthough Treasury does not believe a government guarantee is required, Treasury would support legislation that authorizes an explicit, paid-for guarantee backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government,\u201d the plan states.\n\nIn the meantime, Treasury\u2019s financial backstop for the GSEs will remain.\n\n\u201cTo ensure stability in the housing finance system \u2026 Treasury expects that it will be necessary to maintain limited and tailored government support for the GSEs by leaving the [Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements] in place after the conservatorships,\u201d the proposal states.\n\nFannie and Freddie would compensate the government for that support with a periodic commitment fee, and the stock purchase agreements would be amended \u201cto enhance Treasury\u2019s ability to mitigate the risk of a draw on the commitment.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development on Thursday also released a housing finance reform proposal addressing the roles of the Federal Housing Administration, which supports low- and moderate-income homebuyers, and Ginnie Mae, the government-run corporation that guarantees payments to investors on loans made through federal programs.\n\nThe plan outlines steps to reduce risk in the FHA portfolio and update agency's technology. HUD also signed off on Treasury\u2019s proposal to have Ginnie provide a guarantee on GSE securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Treasury plan also contains some recommendations sure to be welcomed by banks. The department called on FHFA to work with bank regulators to address the \u201cpotentially unwarranted gap\u201d between tough capital rules for banks that hold and service mortgages, and less stringent rules for Fannie and Freddie.\n\nTreasury also said disclosure requirements mandated by the SEC for privately issued mortgage-backed securities puts private-label securities at a disadvantage compared to Fannie and Freddie, which don\u2019t face the same requirements. The SEC should reconsider how much data they require under that rule, and FHFA should then consider requiring the GSEs to conform to it, Treasury said.\n\nTreasury also suggested that Congress replace the companies\u2019 statutory affordable-housing goals \u2014 saying \u201cthe goals were a contributing factor to the GSEs\u2019 risk taking and losses in the lead up to the financial crisis\u201d \u2014 with a levy to fund affordable housing programs administered by HUD.\n\nVictoria Guida contributed to this report.", "description": "Ending government control of Fannie and Freddie is at the center of the proposal.", "authors": ["Katy O'Donnell"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/23/d1/ef4fa2ac4e7c850f774b3e14e6dc/190905-freddie-mac-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
