A Ferris Bueller-esque Mike Pompeo? It's all in the cold open", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" mixed movies and politics in a chaotic cold open this weekend.\n\nThe premise: Vice President Mike Pence (Beck Bennett), Attorney General William Barr (Aidy Bryant) and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon) met in the White House to talk impeachment-avoidance strategy and Ukraine text messages. Characters popped in and out to share unhelpful information. Among them: A surprise appearance by Matthew Broderick as Secretary Mike Pompeo.\n\nBryant's serious Barr weighed in: \"I think we should stop texting about the crimes ... don\u2019t leave crime footprints.\"\n\nBroderick's Pompeo: \"I\u2019ve been asking around and I think this whole impeachment thing could be really bad.\"\n\nOn whether everyone could get their stories to agree, Biden said, \"Even if they're not straight now, they can still be converted to straight, right?\"\n\nPompeo thought it best he leave the meeting, and then flee the country perhaps with the President of Finland (Alex Moffat). With his exit, Broderick's Pompeo said a line familiar to \"Ferris Buller's Day Off\" fans: \"Impeachment moves really fast. If you don\u2019t stop and look around, you might miss it.\"\n\nBarr left, too. So did Ben Carson (Kenan Thompson).\n\nGiuliani also left, to appear on Fox News. But McKinnon's character returned at the end of the sketch.\n\nAs Joker.\n\n\"I just killed on Hannity,\" Giuliani said his so-called \"stage makeup\" made to look like Joaquin Phoenix's \"Joker\" clown makeup. (In the movie, the character makes a memorable talk show appearance). \"And I'll kill again.\"", "description": "In the Oct. 5 episode of \"SNL,\" Matthew Broderick makes a cameo as Mike Pompeo, and Kate McKinnon plays a Rudy Giuliani in \"Joker\" makeup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/02/USAT/fd3e1231-ce25-47af-a319-00b2cac1ceba-AP_Film_Review_-_Joker.JPG?crop=3529,1985,x492,y416&width=2976&height=1984&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
