They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not hire them out of kindness or charity,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe did it because Dreamers embody Apple\u2019s innovation strategy. They come from diverse backgrounds and display a wide range of skills and experiences that equip them to tackle problems from different perspectives. Because they thrived in the face of adversity, they often exhibit extraordinary levels of grit and drive. . . . They have earned the right to continue to contribute to our company and to our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple would quite literally not exist without a brilliant and driven population of immigrants,\u201d Cook and O\u2019Brien said, noting that the father of co-founder Steve Jobs immigrated to the U.S. from Syria.\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in November over the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. A ruling is expected by next June. If the Trump administration\u2019s decision is upheld, hundreds of thousands of young immigrants could be deported.\n\nCook has been outspoken in the past about his support for Dreamers, saying in 2017: \u201cI stand with them.\u201d Cook is not alone; in 2017 a number of executives at top tech companies \u2014 including Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -1.77% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.29% and Facebook Inc. FB, -0.69% \u2014 voiced their collective support for DACA\u2019s preservation.\n\n\u201cWe collectively owe it to the Dreamers to hold up our end of the bargain,\u201d the Apple execs said in their brief. \u201cIt is not just a legal requirement. It is the moral thing to do.\u201d\n\nApple shares slipped Wednesday, but the tech giant\u2019s market cap remained above $1 trillion. Apple stock is up 39% year to date, compared to a 12% gain this year by the Down Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.86% , of which it is a component.", "description": "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed Wednesday, top executives at Apple Inc. urged the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold DACA, the Obama-era law protecting the...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX510_timcoo_ZG_20171101180232.jpg"}
