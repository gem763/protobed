This was presumably done to help improve advancements in AI. People were understandably upset at the potential implications and raised a fuss. Apple responded by suspending the practice and apologizing.\n\nAt the time, Apple CEO Time Cook went on record saying that \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d Everyone seemed at least somewhat mollified by the outcome. Well, that didn\u2019t last very long. The latest update to their operating system is back to allowing human sampling of the audio Siri collects, though you do have some options. (Associated Press)\n\nApple is resuming the use of humans to review Siri commands and dictation with the latest iPhone software update. In August, Apple suspended the practice and apologized for the way it used people, rather than just machines, to review the audio\u2026 Now, Apple is giving consumers notice when installing the update, iOS 13.2. Individuals can choose \u201cNot Now\u201d to decline audio storage and review. Users who enable this can turn it off later in the settings. Apple also specifies that Siri data is not associated with a user\u2019s Apple ID.\n\nI suppose this isn\u2019t as bad as the last episode, assuming you believe everything they\u2019re saying. (A significant assumption to be sure.) The first question here is how useful this system will be to Apple if they\u2019re letting everyone opt out? How many people do you suppose are going to opt in? Having a choice between letting some rando Apple employee listening in on whatever you happened to be discussing in your living room (or your bedroom!) or not doing it seems fairly easy, even if you feel like you have nothing to hide.\n\nRemoving contractors from this work may be a slight improvement, but not much. Your own employees can just as easily \u201cgo rogue\u201d with the recordings as a contractor.\n\nMost of the \u201csampling\u201d will still be done with machines, but I\u2019m not sure how much better that will make everyone feel. If that\u2019s taking place it means that the data (the transcript of your recorded activities) is still being shipped back to HQ. And if so, somebody can access it if they really want to. How much do you trust not just the CEO but the middle managers and drones out on the floor handling this digital treasure trove?\n\nThe issue here is that we\u2019re dealing with a tech giant and not the federal government. (How often do you hear me say that?) If this was the government there would be rules in place, transparency requirements and the ability to request records and details through the Freedom of Information Act. Apple is privately owned. Unless someone can make a credible claim that they\u2019re breaking the law, they don\u2019t have to tell you anything about what they\u2019re doing with your data. And they can lie about if if they wish and probably never be held accountable unless an employee blows the whistle on them. Even then we still won\u2019t get to see their code and darned few of us could understand it if we did.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, my default assumption is that all of our smart devices are gathering data on us and that trend will only expand as the Internet of Things continues to grow and more devices are made \u201csmart.\u201d It\u2019s our choice whether we adopt this technology or not. And if we do, we\u2019re taking chances that nobody had to worry about in the 20th century.", "description": "She's listening", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AlexaSiri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
