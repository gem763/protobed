Lane's proposals have a few points in common, including a major restructuring that would slash spending. He estimates that effort will cost the company $200 million. And WeWork will need at least $1.5 billion in additional funding to complete any of them.\n\nThe company scrapped its proposed IPO as questions about cofounder Adam Neumann's leadership and its business mounted. Lane says any future effort to raise money is going to require a major effort to show potential backers that the company has changed in both cultural and business terms since Neumann gave up the CEO position.\n\nIf WeWork pursues any of these courses, Lane says, it will be a slower-growing and much less valuable company than the one it appeared to be as recently as this summer. For context, his turnaround base case estimates the company will have an enterprise value of $24 billion in 2020 \u2014 a far cry from its $47 billion private valuation peak \u2014 and revenue of $43 billion in 2035, assuming it stays in business.\n\nThen again, even diminished growth is better than where WeWork appears to be heading now, as Lane he said it only has enough funds to last until next spring.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley says WeWork's failed IPO marks the end of an era for unprofitable unicorns \u2014 and explains why it leaves the market's tech kingpins vulnerable\n\n\"In our base case they need a total of $6 billion in incremental funding in order to see themselves through to cashflow positive operations,\" he wrote, noting that if there's a recession that hurts demand for office space, it could need as much as $8 billion without other changes.\n\nWith all of that established, here are the four scenarios that could keep WeWork afloat:\n\n(1) Get the cash\n\nIn this scenario, WeWork tries to become cash flow positive as fast as possible, develops the remaining leases it's signed and doesn't seek any more of them. That would allow it to cut overhead. To complete that plan it would still need $1.5 billion in new funding, according to Lane's estimates.\n\nIf that happened, Lane said WeWork's enterprise value would be $11.5 billion next year, or about half what its value would have been. He said the company's revenue could reach $7 billion in 2025 and grow at the rate of inflation after that.\n\n(2) Steady and slow\n\nLane said WeWork's best option might be becoming cash flow positive from operations, and then resuming its attempts to grow \u2014 but only at a rate it can fund on its own. It would need another $2 billion in funding to get to that point, not that much more than the $1.5 billion in will need if it foregoes expansion altogether.\n\nThat approach would allow for much more growth in the future than the first option, and in 2020 it would make the company worth $15.8 billion according to his estimates. He said its revenue could climb to $36.5 billion in 2035.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley breaks down how the next market downturn could upend what even the most prepared investors are expecting\n\n(3) Finish its current pipeline\n\nHere, WeWork would finish working up its current pipeline of properties over the next three years and then expand at a slower pace, again based on how much growth the company can afford to pay for without raising more money. That results in a company with $10.7 billion in annual revenue in about three years.\n\nHowever it produces a value of $16.4 billion for WeWork, only a bit more than the previous plan. And the company would need $5.4 billion in funding to do it, or almost as much as Lane thinks it needs under its current expansion plan.\n\n4. Take five (years)\n\nLane suggests the company could complete its existing growth plan, but do it over five years instead of three, and then fund its own growth after that. That pace would allow WeWork to generate $34 billion in revenue in 2035, and the company would need $3.9 billion in additional funding to get to that point.", "description": "Bernstein's Chris Lane says WeWork has a shot to survive and shows four ways it could endure as a smaller, slower-growing company.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d96416a8ff853002a662851?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
