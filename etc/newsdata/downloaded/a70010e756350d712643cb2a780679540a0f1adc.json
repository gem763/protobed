Well, this month if you\u2019re in New Zealand. Next month if you\u2019re Down Under.\n\nCreated by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, the mockumentary follows coppers Officer O\u2019Leary (Karen O\u2019Leary) and Officer Minogue (Kyle Minogue) as they investigate a string of paranormal activities.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Wellington Paranormal, Officer O\u2019Leary and Officer Minogue are the incredibly switched on cops from What We Do In The Shadows.\n\nAnyway, the task force is headed by Sergeant Maaka (Maaka Pohatu) who recruited the officers because of a rise in paranormal activity across Wellington. Think werewolves, projectile-vomiting drunk teenagers / demons, aliens, weird cults, creepy clowns, and zombies. The whole gang gang!\n\nSeason 2 will have 13 episodes all up \u2013 seven more than season 1.\n\nCo-creator Clement announced the good news yesterday, tweeting: \u201cNZ. Season 2. Nearly here.\u201d\n\nSBS Viceland confirmed they\u2019ll be streaming season 2 in November. The network didn\u2019t provide an exact date but they\u2019ll release \u201cmore details soon\u201d so we\u2019ll keep you updated.\n\nAustralia, Wellington Paranormal season 2 is coming to you soon. https://t.co/XlFN0D7aTB \u2014 Jemaine Clement (@AJemaineClement) October 8, 2019\n\nAs for season 1, you can stream all six episodes (!!!) on SBS On Demand right now. They\u2019re only about 20 minutes each so it\u2019s easy bingeing material to bring in the spooky season.\n\nSuss out the episodes / stream them all right HERE.\n\nMeanwhile, Taika Waititi\u2019s basking in the glory of his latest flick Jojo Rabbit. The World War II satire premiered last month at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nRoman Griffin Davis stars in the lead role as Jojo, a lonely German boy whose best friend is a dumb imaginary blue-eyed Hitler. All is\u2026 well (?) until Jojo finds out Mum (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. And suddenly, Jojo\u2019s whole world is turned upside down.\n\nThe film has copped pretty mixed reviews, which is hardly a surprise considering its subject matter. It still looks like a hoot though. If you want to read a couple of the reviews, head on over to the below.", "description": "The second season of\u00a0Wellington Paranormal,\u00a0the unholy\u00a0What We Do In The Shadows\u00a0spin-off, will hit TVs next month (November).", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-12.43.13-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
