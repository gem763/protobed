Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). Only one of the four, Omar, was not born in the U.S.; she is a native of Somalia who came to America as a youngster with her family.\n\nMunchetty, a native of London whose mother is Indian and whose father is from the Republic of Mauritius, joined in the outraged reaction from several quarters to Trump\u2019s tweet. She said on-air, \u201cEvery time I have been told, as a woman of color, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism. Now I\u2019m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious that a man in that position feels it\u2019s okay to skirt the lines with using language like that.\u201d\n\nA viewer submitted a complaint to the BBC about Munchetty\u2019s comments, asserting the bias in its coverage\n\nIn line with BBC procedures, its executive complaints unit reviewed the matter and determined that \u201cit was entirely legitimate\u201d for Munchetty to invoke \u201cher own experience of racism and the racist context in which suggestions that people from ethnic minorities should go back to their own countries are generally made.\u201d\n\nBut the unit also found that because \u201cshe went on to comment critically on the possible motive for, and potential consequences\u201d of Trump\u2019s words, her comments \u201cfell short of due impartiality\u201d and found the complaint was justified.\n\nOn Monday, BBC Director-General Tony Hall emailed staffers to announce that the ruling would be thrown out.\n\nA copy of the message shared on Twitter by Simon Gilbert, one of the network\u2019s political reporters, said, \u201cRacism is racism and the BBC is not impartial on the topic.\u201d\n\nIn this case, Munchetty\u2019s words were not \u201csufficient to merit a partial uphold around the comments she made,\u201d Hall said. He stressed that no sanction had ever been issued against Munchetty, and he called her \u201can exceptional journalist.\u201d\n\nHall\u2019s memo came after an outcry from politicians, media professionals and other public figures over the initial finding against Munchetty. Some of the critics urged the network in an open letter published by The Guardian on Friday to reconsider its original decision.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that future [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] broadcasters will be hired at the corporation on the premise that they remain \u2018impartial\u2019 about how they feel about their experiences of racism is ludicrous,\u201d the letter read. \u201cTo require journalists of all ethnicities and races to endorse racism as a legitimate \u2018opinion\u2019 is an abrogation of responsibility of the most serious nature.\u201d", "description": "Naga Munchetty spoke out against Trump tweets in July that targeted four congresswomen of color.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d928d522100005b00fe67fe.jpeg?cache=442zgbrgku&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
