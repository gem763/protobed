I had trusted this stranger who convinced me to hang out at his place in the middle of nowhere, only to later admit that it wasn\u2019t even his house before he ran away into the night. Or I could pay the 30-euro [$32.87] Uber ride and head to the club.\n\nI chose the club. And in doing so, I think I embraced the true spirit of Oktoberfest.\n\nThough I didn\u2019t know too much about the annual 16-day event\u2014a massive beer festival and carnival that takes place in Munich\u2014the things I did know didn\u2019t exactly thrill me, especially at age 32: Lots of straight drunk (mostly white) dudes. Young people being sloppy. Massive crowds. Long lines. Overpriced food and drinks. Costumes.\n\nNonetheless, as my two-month fellowship in Germany came to a close, I pitched my editors on sending me to Oktoberfest. I thought it had the potential to be a funny fish-out-of-water story, not unlike the time I attended a Nickelback concert or joined a psychedelic commune. Plus, I was curious to see a more conservative part of the country, having been mostly living in a Berlin bubble of beautiful weirdos.\n\nThe VICE Germany editors, based in Berlin, were happy to send me, though they didn\u2019t exactly give ringing endorsements. \u201cI avoid it with all the strength in my body,\u201d one said. Another noted, \u201cI absolutely hate it.\u201d\n\nBefore I went, I had to prep.\n\nDirndl shopping\n\nAccording to the city of Munich, Oktoberfest started as a wedding celebration between Crown Prince (later King) Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen on October 12, 1810. It repeated the next year, and by 1896 the first beer tents and halls debuted. Today, Oktoberfest, locally called the Wiesn, is the biggest beer festival in the world, with more than 7 million people in attendance each year. (Munich\u2019s population is about 1.5 million.) There are 14 big tents run by six breweries, which can seat a total of more than 100,000 guests. You need a seat to order beer.\n\nVisitors typically wear traditional clothing, which means lederhosen (knee-length brown leather shorts) for men and dresses called dirndls for women, which are paired with a blouse and an apron.\n\n\n\nMy first task was to get a dirndl.\n\nWhen I showed up at a shop that specializes in dirndls, one of the sales associates took one look at me and advised me that the sale racks were outside. Ouch, my very own Pretty Woman moment\u2014except she was right. The higher-end dirndls there cost up to 600 euros [$657.38]. Even the discount ones, at around 130 euros [$142.43], were out of my price range. Nonetheless, I tried several of them on.\n\nDirndls are pricey as hell.\n\nBecause they\u2019re corseted on top, dirndls can be pretty flattering. They suck your tummy in and push your boobs out. My favorite selection, a blue number, made me look like a (brown) Snow White.\n\n\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t willing to spend the equivalent of my monthly rent in Berlin on a one-time thing, so I headed to some fast fashion shops. After trying on some truly hideous dirndls, including one that seemed to be made from a pink garbage bag, I settled on a maroon dirndl that set me back 60 euros [$66]. I paired it with my own long-sleeved blouse to make it extra dowdy. When I sent my boyfriend a photo, he said it made me look like I had a \u201chard day of labor ahead of me.\u201d\n\nArrival and warnings\n\nBefore heading to the grounds, I got some advice from a couple of locals. One, who wasn\u2019t a fan of Oktoberfest, described it as \u201cfucked up, crazy, and sometimes a little bit beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are a man, watch out for people who want to punch you for no reason. If you\u2019re a woman, watch out for people who want to touch you and your body,\u201d he warned me. \u201cIt's getting worse in the evening and worst for women who wear dirndl with big cleavages.\u201d\n\nHe let me know that if you tie the knot of your apron to the left it means you\u2019re single, whereas the right means you\u2019re taken. (I tied mine in the middle.)\n\nHe also told me to watch out for \u201cKotzh\u00fcgel\u201d (Vomit Mountain), a slope on the west side of the grounds where people \u201cvomit and fuck.\u201d\n\nI felt myself bracing as I saw big groups of young men in their lederhosen. There were distinct spring break/frat party/what I imagine St. Patrick\u2019s Day in hell is like vibes.\n\nAfter an embarrassing subway ride on which surprisingly few people were in costume, I grabbed a road beer for courage. I passed by some Volkswagen police vans blasting music, a man making his own techno beats in a horse mask, and a guy dressed up as Chucky, the killer doll from Child\u2019s Play.\n\nMe and a man inexplicably dressed as Chucky.\n\nLater, I passed by a white guy who saw some Black women and screamed \u201cBlack girls!\u201d My stomach tightened.\n\n\n\nMaking friends\n\nFirst up, was an 8-euro [$8.77] Ferris wheel ride to get an overview of the grounds. In line, I quickly made friends with a group of young people. One of them, a Brit, knocked backwards into me screaming \u201cmy balls!\u201d because his friends had kicked him in the nuts. Once we got to the top, the drunk Brit with the sore testicles began yelling \u201cGuten tag\u201d in a faux German accent and calling the friend who had kicked him a \u201cfucking alcoholic four-eyed prick!\u201d I was relieved that I hadn\u2019t worn my glasses.\n\nFrom the top, I could see the massive white beer tents, which looked more like warehouses, and various rides lit up with neon lights, a steady stream of people walking along the wide path in the middle. But I wanted off the ride. I needed to get drunker if I was going to survive.\n\nView of Oktoberfest grounds from the top of the Ferris wheel.\n\nOnce we got down, myself and one of the guys from the Ferris wheel set off to find a beer tent. I could tell he was hammered because his eyes were bloodshot and every two to three minutes he asked me the same sequence of questions: How long have you been in Europe? Do you like it here? What do you think of Oktoberfest?\n\n\n\nAfter getting flatly rejected while trying to find seats in one of the more popular tents, we headed to a tent called Lowenbrau. This time we found some people willing to share space at their outdoor table. I wanted to order the pig\u2019s knuckle but it cost 20 euros [$21.19] so I settled on sausages and potato salad, along with my first stein (a full liter!) of beer.\n\nOne of the women at the table, a Polish bartender who lives in Munich, told me she hates working during Oktoberfest.\n\n\u201cThe people drink too much alcohol. They\u2019re too drunk, really drunk,\u201d she said. She noted that these drunks don\u2019t particularly tip well.\n\nStephan Bock, a 19-year-old local who is studying engineering, told me he paid 600 euros [$657] on his lederhosen and vest. Despite spending that much, he said Oktoberfest is \u201cnothing special if you live in Munich.\u201d\n\nStephan Bock, 19, says Oktoberfest is no big deal to locals but he spent 600 euros on his outfit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s every year the same. You only see how the prices go higher and higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe advised me to go into a tent to get the full experience. But when I asked what more there is to do, his answer was \u201csit and drink,\u201d which we were already doing.\n\nDuring our conversation, Bock seemed surprised when I told him I was enjoying living in Berlin.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really ugly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty\u2026 Everybody is trying to sell you drugs.\u201d\n\nHis comments were echoed by several people over the course of the evening, making me wonder if there was some sort of rivalry between the two cities. Conversely, none of the Berliners I knew had any interest in Oktoberfest\u2014and many seemed to hold it in outright contempt.\n\nLater, I struck up a conversation with Bernhard, a 58-year-old lifelong Bavarian and mountaineer. When I told him I was Canadian, he showed me a Haida-inspired tattoo on his arm. But when I asked if he knew anything about Haida people he said not really, he just thought it looked cool. He would probably vote for Justin Trudeau.\n\nBernhard has a tattoo he says was inspired by Haida art.\n\nHe observed that tourists visiting don\u2019t drink the way Bavarians do and in particular \u201cCanadians and Australians mix liquor with weed\u201d with poor results. I grimaced at being lumped in with Aussies.\n\n\n\nBack in the day, Bernhard said women in the Haufbrau tent (now known as the sloppy tourist tent) used to take off their underwear and throw them toward the ceiling.\n\n\u201cThey make a striptease,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see the pussy.\u201d But he said that stopped because it was \u201ctoo much trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrunk men cannot tell the difference between fun and a sexual offer,.\u201d he added. He worded it in a clumsy way, but I feel like he was trying to throw shade at the men, not the women.\n\nAfter party\n\nI headed to the bathroom and discovered that the toilets were shockingly clean (Germans really have nailed public washroom cleanliness). As I came out, I got kicked out of the area because it was already 10:30 p.m. and the tent was closed.\n\nI was a little concerned that I hadn\u2019t made it inside a tent yet, but I reasoned that I still had a full day on Friday.\n\nRather than go home, I went to a bar with the American who kept asking me the same shit over and over. There, I stripped several layers in a booth and danced.\n\nThe pose of a man who is rethinking his decisions.\n\nLater, I got into a debate about drug policy and abortion with a guy who kept hitting on me; he left. Then I chatted with a couple of young Germans who said they wished they had weed but they were too scared to pick up any in Munich because of how harsh police are there. I\u2019ve been told that cops in Bavaria treat even minor possession as a big deal, in contrast to Berlin. It made me a bit homesick for Canada.\n\n\n\nAround 4 a.m., I got back to my hotel room.\n\nDay 2\n\nThe next day, I got down to the grounds but I was too hungover to go inside so I sat outside on a sidewalk nursing a beer for about half an hour as a man nearby made occasional kissing noises at me.\n\nHair of the dog wasn't working too well for me.\n\nIt was hot and crowded outside\u2014so crowded that someone burnt my hand with a cigarette. I met a friend who\u2019s been staying in Munich and we wandered into one of the beer tents, sitting next to a group of guys from Switzerland. I ask them why they like Oktoberfest, and all three gave some variation of \u201cbecause I love beer.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen I pressed them about some of the perceived downsides, like the crowds, prices, and reputation for being gross, one of them, Basile Krieg, 42, replied, \u201cWhy is it disgusting? You can drink beer, you can eat some chicken.\u201d I sensed that I wasn\u2019t going to get much more insight out of these fellas. But their enthusiasm was kind of infectious. I stood up on a table and sang \u201cEin Prosit\u201d (the drinking song) with them, downed my stein, and began contemplating catching a later flight back to Berlin.\n\n\n\nThese Swiss men said their love for beer was their main reason for attending Oktoberfest.\n\nThat\u2019s when I met Cedric Tzeuton, 29, a Parisian who told me he\u2019s originally from Cameroon. It was his first Oktoberfest. Tzeuton, who previously lived in Berlin, said it was \u201ccharming to be colliding\u201d with Munich\u2019s \u201chardcore conservatism.\u201d\n\nTzeuton was one of the few Black people I saw at Oktoberfest and I asked him if it made him nervous to walk into a festival full of thousands of hammered white folks.\n\n\u201cAfter a while it doesn\u2019t really get to you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot more of the attraction and interest and intrigue.\u201d\n\nSharing a pretzel with my new friend Cedric.\n\nSkipping my flight\n\nTzeuton encouraged me to stay and experience a Friday night at Oktoberfest. I was enjoying hanging out with him and frankly was getting drunk so I started asking people I hardly know if I could crash at their apartment for the night. Unsurprisingly, no one wanted to host a drunk Canadian.\n\nBut then I saw a 6 a.m. flight to Berlin and decided I didn\u2019t actually need a place to sleep. I would simply party until 4 a.m. again and head straight to the airport!\n\nThis was the turning point for me. I realized that although Oktoberfest represented a lot of things I dislike, the key to getting through it is surrendering mentally. Yes, there are crowds, yes, you might get burned by a cigarette by drunk people, but once you realize there\u2019s no shortcut to avoid that, you have to suck it up and have a good time. If you put in a bit of effort, and get drunk enough, there are some interesting conversations to be had. Having said that, I probably wouldn\u2019t do it again.\n\nI spent the next chunk of the night in a traditional tent in the old Weisn, eating schnitzel and watching German folk dances. Before I left, I visited Vomit Mountain, where I saw five cops try to lift up a grown man who was barfing and then give up and let him lay back down on the grass. People were making out everywhere.\n\nAdventures at Vomit Mountain\n\nI looked a little to the left of barfing guy, and locked eyes with the aforementioned man who eventually ghosted me. I told him I wanted to go to a club called Milchbar. He said he was down, but that it didn\u2019t open for another hour so we should chill at his place in the meantime. I really should have googled it because I realized later he was lying. Instead I followed him into a quiet but affluent suburb made up of impressive houses.\n\nAs we were leaving he told me, \u201cMake sure you have everything\u201d in a slightly paranoid tone. As we walked back out to the street, I asked him if he even lived in that house. That\u2019s when he admitted he\u2019d gotten the keys from a friend who rented a room there. As we were about to grab an Uber, he said, \u201cI forgot my cash\u201d and told me he would be right back. He ran off into the rainy night and never showed up again. I headed to the club solo.\n\nIn the end, I got to the airport and passed out before going through security. I woke up just in time to make my flight. In a way, it would have been very Oktoberfest of me to miss it.\n\nA week later, on my last weekend in Germany, a friend and I managed to get into Berghain, a notoriously exclusive techno club in Berlin. After my Oktoberfest adventures, it felt like a palette cleanser. I didn\u2019t drink a single beer.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter.", "description": "In theory I should have hated everything about the world\u2019s largest beer festival, but somehow I thrived.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9c8ea0e31505000ab5c0cc/lede/1570542955968-oktoberfest-lead.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8356850250341374xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
