REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is examining the impact of climate on the world\u2019s financial markets and whether it is priced into market valuations, the head of the global lender\u2019s markets division said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe are doing work on the pricing of climate risks and to what extent it is priced into stock and bond markets,\u201d Tobias Adrian, financial counselor and director of the IMF\u2019s monetary and capital markets department, told Reuters. \u201cWe are going to look at stock markets country by country, then by sector.\u201d\n\nThe financial cost of climate change was the subject of many discussions at the IMF during its fall meetings this week.\n\n\u201cPeople are more and more aware of this - there\u2019s a certain urge around climate that is new,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hopeful that people focus on it, but the reason they focus is that they\u2019re worried. The fact that this really has become a big topic at the IMF speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nAdrian said that to some economies, climate poses a short-term risk, such as in the Bahamas, which was slammed by Hurricane Dorian in September. However, to most economies, the risks are long term.\n\nSome investors have become concerned that climate risk is underpriced in residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, which are pools of home loans sold to investors, with exposure to climate hot spots like Texas and Florida.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund is examining the impact of climate on the world's financial markets and whether it is priced into market valuations, the head of the global lender's markets division said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Megan Davies", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442821852&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0NV", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
