Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one. I gave her every break, despite the fact that she was despised by everyone, and she went for some cheap money from a book,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cNumerous others also!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump mentioned Ms. Manigault Newman, who left his administration nearly two years ago, while discussing the recent firing of his former personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout.\n\nMs. Westerhout, 28, was ousted as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal assistant Thursday after sharing intimate details with reporters about the president and his family during a recent off-the-record dinner, according to multiple news outlets.\n\n\u201cWhile Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted several minutes earlier Saturday.\n\n\u201cShe called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nA former reality TV star made famous by the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d show starring Mr. Trump, Ms. Manigault Newman worked on the president\u2019s 2016 election campaign prior to serving in the first several months of his administration as assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison.\n\nMs. Manigault Newman\u2019s resignation from the White House was announced in December 2017, taking effect the following month on the first anniversary of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nShe subsequently wrote a book about Mr. Trump, \u201cUnhinged,\u201d released in August 2018, in which she described the president as a \u201cracist\u201d who has repeatedly used the N-word.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign responded at the time of the book\u2019s publication by announcing arbitration against Ms. Manigault Newman, citing an alleged breach of her 2016 confidentiality agreement with the Trump campaign.\n\nA media representative for Ms. Manigault Newman did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
