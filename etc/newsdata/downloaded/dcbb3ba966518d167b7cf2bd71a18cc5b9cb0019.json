All ten of Code Barrel's employees will move in-house to Atlassian's Sydney office.\n\n\"This marks an amazing milestone in the Code Barrel journey and is a strong testament to how far we've come from the early days (and nights) of sitting in a cafe in Vietnam working away on code,\" Mr Knecht wrote on his blog today.\n\n\"In many ways it feels like we never left. My co-founder Nick and I spent a collective 20 years at Atlassian and it became a massive part of our lives.\n\n\"Naturally, when we left to set up our own company, building apps for the Atlassian Marketplace, we lived by the same values.\"", "description": "Two engineers Nick Menere and Andreas left Atlassian three years ago to hit up start-up land on their own.
