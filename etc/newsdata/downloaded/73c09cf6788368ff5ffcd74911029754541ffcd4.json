the October 31 leaving date \u2013 even if the Prime Minister wins Commons support for a deal with the EU next weekend.\n\nFormer Cabinet Ministers Philip Hammond and Dominic Grieve are central to moves to compel Mr Johnson to send a letter to Brussels asking for an extension to the UK\u2019s membership, regardless of the outcome of this week\u2019s high-stakes Brexit diplomacy.\n\nThe plot, which threatens to throw the Prime Minister\u2019s plans for a snap post-Brexit Election into disarray, caused fury in No 10, which last night accused Mr Hammond of trying to \u2018sabotage\u2019 Mr Johnson\u2019s \u2018do or die\u2019 Halloween exit date.\n\nThe move came amid cautious optimism in Downing Street about the prospects of a last-minute breakthrough in negotiations this weekend over a new customs arrangement for Northern Ireland, which could be approved at Thursday\u2019s critical EU summit in time for MPs to vote for it at Saturday\u2019s historic Commons sitting.\n\nFormer Cabinet Ministers Philip Hammond and Dominic Grieve (right) are central to moves to compel Mr Johnson to send a letter to Brussels asking for an extension to the UK\u2019s membership, regardless of the outcome of this week\u2019s high-stakes Brexit diplomacy\n\nSources said that Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish government in Dublin were \u2018engaging\u2019 with the idea of removing the need for a border with the Republic of Ireland by keeping the province inside the EU\u2019s customs umbrella while allowing it to benefit from the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade deals.\n\nHowever, Tory MPs in the hard-line ERG group and many Ministers remain in the dark about what exactly Mr Johnson has put on the table.\n\nAnd last night, Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, repeated his demand that Northern Ireland must leave the EU Customs Union with Great Britain, with No 10 seeking to reassure him by making private promises this was still a negotiation \u2018red line\u2019.\n\nThe plot, which threatens to throw Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for a snap post-Brexit Election into disarray, caused fury in No 10, which last night accused Mr Hammond of trying to \u2018sabotage\u2019 Mr Johnson\u2019s \u2018do or die\u2019 Halloween exit date\n\nThe Brexit plan is expected to be discussed by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel over dinner in Paris this evening ahead of the Brussels summit.\n\nBut without a Commons majority, Mr Johnson will be forced to rely on both Labour rebels and the votes of many of the 21-strong group of former Tory MPs who lost the whip last month when they voted to block a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday understands that the group, which includes former Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, is split over whether to vote for the deal \u2013 with one prominent member warning that it looked like a \u2018pretty hard Brexit\u2019 for Great Britain even if it amounted to a \u2018very, very soft Brexit\u2019 for Northern Ireland.\n\nHowever, there is more of a consensus that Mr Johnson should be forced to delay Brexit, even if he wins MPs\u2019 backing for the deal.\n\nThe delay faction, which includes Mr Hammond, argues that the Prime Minister should not be allowed to take the UK out of the EU at the end of the month without the Commons being given more time to examine the deal and pass the necessary legislation.\n\nFormer Cabinet Office Minister Sir David Lidington said: \u2018I\u2019ve always felt there would at least need to be a time where technical legal details had to be hammered out and that was going to take us beyond the end of October\u2019\n\nA source close to the former Chancellor said: \u2018There is a distinction between Parliament \u201capproving\u201d the broad outline of a deal in a simple motion and Parliament legislating for a deal.\n\n\u2018The fact is that the latter is not possible in the time remaining, so the Benn Act will come into force to allow some time to legislate and finalise the deal.\u2019\n\nThe source added that the Benn Act \u2013 the law passed by pro-Remain MPs to compel Mr Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he had not secured a deal by October 19 \u2013 \u2018has clearly forced the Prime Minister to finally devote time and energy into securing a deal\u2019.\n\nLast night, in response, a senior Government source said: \u2018As Chancellor, Hammond sabotaged the negotiations and sabotaged preparations to leave \u2013 now he\u2019s trying to sabotage leaving altogether.\n\n\u2018His latest move shows that he is not trying to stop No Deal \u2013 he is trying to enforce a No Brexit\u2019.\n\nEven one fellow Conservative rebel described Mr Hammond as \u2018totally paranoid\u2019.\n\nSeven frantic days will decide the UK's future It is the make-or-break week that will decide the fate of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit and maybe even of Brexit itself. But the momentous seven days begin today with a crucial event he is not invited to \u2013 a meeting in Paris between Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. Their dinner in the Elysee Palace this evening will go a long way to deciding how other EU leaders judge Mr Johnson\u2019s \u2018deal\u2019 with Irish premier Leo Varadkar. Tomorrow, Mr Johnson will hope the Queen\u2019s Speech will give the country a vision of his post-Brexit UK as Her Majesty sets out the Government\u2019s new programme of legislation. But the glittering pomp of the state opening of Parliament will arguably be overshadowed in Brexit importance by a meeting in drab surroundings in Brussels. There, Michel Barnier, EU chief Brexit negotiator, is due to brief EU ambassadors on the progress of talks. On Tuesday, Ministers from across the EU are set to meet in Luxembourg where the overall outline of a deal must be agreed if it is to be signed off by the end of the week. Then on Wednesday Mr Macron and Ms Merkel will hold another \u2018tete-a-tete\u2019 ahead of a joint Franco-German cabinet meeting in Toulouse. On Thursday Mr Johnson will join the Council of Ministers summit in Brussels to begin debating approval of the deal and/or a delay to the entire Brexit process. Sometime on Friday the Prime Minister will know whether the EU has signed off his deal or read the last rites over it. The week reaches its momentous climax with a Saturday sitting of Parliament \u2013 the first since the Falklands conflict. If a deal has been agreed, Mr Johnson will seek to get the Commons to approve it. If he has failed to get a deal, the PM will fight to get MPs to agree to his \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge to achieve Brexit by October 31 regardless. In either case, Labour MPs and Tory rebels are threatening to combine to force him to accept a delay or a second referendum as the price of backing any deal. Late on Saturday, Mr Johnson and the country will find out just who has won. By Brendan Carlin\n\nThe rebel ridiculed the former Chancellor, saying he wanted to vote for a delay to Brexit because he feared that Mr Johnson would try to introduce a No Deal Brexit \u2018by the back door\u2019 by \u2018crashing\u2019 the deal after the October 19 deadline stipulated by the Benn Act had expired.\n\nBut Mr Hammond\u2019s stance was backed by Tory former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who insisted Mr Johnson would have to accept a delay even if his deal passed. Mr Grieve said: \u2018He\u2019s going to have to extend. I cannot see how he would be justified in trying to force through a major piece of constitutional legislation, the Withdrawal Agreement Act, in seven days. It\u2019s improper.\u2019\n\nAnd former Cabinet Office Minister Sir David Lidington said: \u2018I\u2019ve always felt there would at least need to be a time where technical legal details had to be hammered out and that was going to take us beyond the end of October.\u2019\n\nSir David, who was Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, also mocked Mr Johnson\u2019s key advisor Dominic Cummings for making \u2018Kevin the Teenager-style\u2019 rants, adding: \u2018When advisors become a story it\u2019s usually a bad thing for the politician who\u2019s hired them\u2019.\n\nAnother of the Tory rebels said: \u2018It\u2019s hard to see how he [Mr Johnson] can get all of this done by October 31 realistically.\n\n\u2018At a practical level, I think it would be extraordinary if the draft text could be finalised before then and you cannot begin to do the legislation until that\u2019s been done.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see it\u2019s feasible to leave on October 31. I can\u2019t see how we could with confidence pass the necessary motion next Saturday which means that the Benn Act provisions do not apply,\u2019 the rebel added.\n\n\u2018It might be a technical extension but you still might require a couple of months just to have time to agree the legal text and take the legislation through. I think the letter [to delay] will still be needed.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s Brexit negotiator David Frost was holed up in Brussels talks last night that will continue throughout today before his EU counterpart briefs member states on the progress of talks.\n\nA senior Downing Street source told The Mail on Sunday that there was \u2018medium\u2019 hope of a breakthrough but insisted that \u2018we\u2019re not about to sell out our core principles\u2019.\n\nThere are fears that reopening the Withdrawal Agreement to remove the hated Northern Irish backstop with Mr Johnson\u2019s new customs plan will mean 11th hour demands from other EU countries when the UK is most vulnerable.\n\nEU sources say Germany\u2019s commissioner Gunther Oettinger has privately suggested hiking the UK\u2019s \u00a339 billion divorce bill in order to make Britain pay for Europe\u2019s No Deal contingency planning. And there are also warnings that Spain could launch a fresh assault on winning concessions over Gibraltar.\n\nIf Mr Johnson fails to win a deal or MPs vote down his deal, pro-Remain MPs are discussing multipleoptions to delay Brexit \u2013 including legislating to give Speaker John Bercow the power to send the letter to Brussels or even appointing him as an interim PM by voting down the Queen\u2019s Speech in the week starting October 21 and voting no confidence in the Government.\n\nBrexit and War of the Wags collide: Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar joke, 'We got on better than Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy' as they reach a 'breakthrough' in top secret talks\n\nThe anonymous sniping and briefings swirling between the UK and the EU at the beginning of last week would have made Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy blush. Pictured are Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson as WAGs\n\nThe anonymous sniping and briefings swirling between the UK and the EU at the beginning of last week would have made Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy blush.\n\nFaceless No 10 aides tore chunks out of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, while EU Council President Donald Tusk took to Twitter to mock Boris Johnson in his beloved Latin.\n\nBut by Thursday the two biggest news stories of the week \u2013 Brexit and the War of the WAGs \u2013 collided in a wedding venue just outside Liverpool.\n\nMr Varadkar, who has been the pin-up baddie for Brexiteers over the past three years, broke the ice as he sat down with Boris Johnson in the wood-panelled reception room of 19th Century Thornton Manor on the Wirral.\n\n\u2018You know this is where Coleen Rooney had her birthday party,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Well, we get on better than those two,\u2019 Mr Johnson quipped back, in a nod to the ongoing saga between Mrs Rooney and the wife of England footballer Jamie Vardy.\n\nAfter exchanging small talk about their partners and Downing Street\u2019s new dog Dilyn, the pair kicked out their aides and did not reappear for 90 minutes.\n\nWhat they discussed remains a tightly guarded secret, but there has been a total change in the relationship between Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart, compared to Mr Varadkar\u2019s tense and scratchy dealings with Theresa May.\n\n\u2018Boris finds Leo very impressive,\u2019 says a source close to the PM. \u2018They get on very well.\u2019\n\nThe talks lasted long enough for both peckish Downing Street staff and their Merrion Street counterparts to put aside three years of tense talks and eat their bosses\u2019 prepared lunch. They were putting away the smoked salmon and suitably European prosciutto sandwiches, pasta and a cheeseboard meant for the premiers when the two leaders called them back into the room for further talks.\n\nMr Varadkar broke the ice as he sat down with Boris Johnson in the wood-panelled reception room of 19th Century Thornton Manor on the Wirral. \u2018You know this is where Coleen Rooney had her birthday party,\u2019 he said. \u2018Well, we get on better than those two,' Mr Johnson quipped back\n\n\u2018It was instantly clear there had been a breakthrough,\u2019 a Downing Street aide said. \u2018We were hopeful that the moment Leo set foot in England we might have a chance, but their smiles took everyone back a bit.\u2019\n\nExtra lunch had to be ordered when the pair had finally finished further talks in the grounds of the manor, while aides hammered out a joint statement that neither side had expected to be so positive just hours earlier.\n\nBut in reality their meeting was the product of weeks of delicate diplomacy behind the scenes, even if pugnacious No 10 aide Dominic Cummings\u2019 briefings against the EU garnered the most public attention.\n\nFollowing a row over the leaking of details of a call with between Mr Johnson and Mrs Merkel on Tuesday, followed by a vicious briefing against Mr Varadkar\u2019s intransigence on Wednesday, it looked like all hope of a deal was dead.\n\nA 30-minute phone call between Chancellor Sajid Javid and his Irish counterpart Paschal Donohoe helped soothe tempers, but defenders of Mr Cummings insist there was \u2018method to the madness\u2019 and the hardline stance helped to \u2018bring the Irish to our table\u2019.\n\nHowever two other key Downing Street figures have been singled out for making the Liverpool summit happen \u2013 Brexit negotiator David Frost and Chief of Staff Sir Edward Lister.\n\nA Downing Street insider said: \u2018There has been a lot of nonsense floating around for the last few weeks that we haven\u2019t been trying to get a deal.\n\n\u2018In reality Frosty has been working his b******s off in Brussels since August, and Eddie has diligently won over the Irish, flying back and forth to Dublin under the radar for weeks.\n\n\u2018Three months ago Varadkar was saying no talks, no changes, nothing. But there he was, negotiating with the Brits in Britain.\u2019", "description": "Philip Hammond and Dominic Grieve are central to moves to compel Mr Johnson to send a letter to Brussels asking for an extension to the UK's membership.", "authors": ["Glen Owen", "Harry Cole", "Brendan Carlin For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19637058-0-image-a-49_1570914858480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
