Joe Biden\u2019s second bid for the presidency began with a gaffe.\n\nThe same day Biden made his presidential bid official, The New York Observer published an interview where Biden evaluated the man who would later become his boss. \u201cI mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\u201d Biden said of future President Barack Obama. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a storybook, man.\u201d\n\nBiden held a conference call with reporters to clean up the remarks, saying he \u201creally regret[ted] that some have taken totally out of context my use of the world \u2018clean.\u2019\u201d Obama essentially let Biden off the hook, only objecting to the \u201chistorical inaccuracy\u201d of not acknowledging prior African-American presidential candidates like Jesse Jackson and Shirley Chisholm.\n\nThe gaffe, in the end, didn\u2019t damage his standing within the Democratic Party. Eighteen months later, Obama selected Biden as his running mate. The party\u2019s establishment embraced him as an elder statesman who could cut deals with Republicans and go head-to-head with foreign leaders. Democratic voters turned him into Uncle Joe, a goofy but well-meaning campaigner who could campaign even in the most conservative parts of the political map. As he weighs a third bid for president, he\u2019s one of the two leading candidates in public polling.\n\nBiden, who is under fire for his history of touching women inappropriately, opened his speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers with a joke about having \u201cpermission\u201d to hug Lonnie Stephenson, the union president who introduced him. The joke generated ripples of laughter among the mostly white, mostly male and mostly older union members gathered in the basement of the Washington Hilton, and frustrated eye-rolls and clenched fists of anger on Twitter.\n\nAt the end of his speech, Biden held an impromptu press conference and offered an apology of sorts for his joke.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intent to make light of anyone\u2019s discomfort. I realize it\u2019s my responsibility to not invade the space of anyone who is uncomfortable in this regard,\u201d he told reporters as union members yelled \u201cRun, Joe, Run\u201d and \u201cWe need you!\u201d in the background. \u201cI literally think it is incumbent on me and everyone else to make sure if you embrace someone, you touch someone, it\u2019s with their consent regardless of your intentions.\u201d\n\nApology or not, Biden\u2019s comments during his 40-minute speech to the union and his brief back-and-forth with reporters made it clear the the 76-year-old Biden, who was an elected official for 47 years, doesn\u2019t plan on changing his unscripted style or center-left ideology, and is willing to bet that the party around him hasn\u2019t changed much either. It\u2019s a strategy that makes sense for an official with Biden\u2019s deal-making instincts and long, frequently problematic voting record.\n\n\u201cIf you look at all the polling data and you look at the results, the party has not moved,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that most of the members of the Democratic Party are liberal-moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\u201d\n\nHe noted he campaigned for 65 Democrats during the 2018 election. \u201cShow me the really left, left, left-wingers who beat a Republican,\u201d he challenged a reporter. \u201cThe idea that the Democratic Party has sort of stood on its head, I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nAsked what type of Democrat he was, Biden quickly identified himself with the party\u2019s most popular figure: \u201cI\u2019m an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. And I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden disputes \"the idea the Democratic party has been stood on its head.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. And I'm proud of it.\" https://t.co/ebTwELenZl pic.twitter.com/LkYFcSWG6u \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 5, 2019\n\nBiden\u2019s political analysis has merit: Not a single candidate endorsed by the Bernie Sanders-backed Our Revolution or the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-backed Justice Democrats defeated a GOP incumbent in 2018. And while the party\u2019s voters have moved to the left on immigration, guns and race in recent years, progressives have struggled to make support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency a must-pass litmus test for voters.\n\nIn Gallup\u2019s polling, about 46% of Democrats identify as liberal, up from 32% around the beginning of the new millennium. In the same time frame, the percentage identifying as moderate has dropped from 42% to 35%, and those identifying as conservative have fallen from 23% to 17%. Those changes are significant, but not overwhelming.\n\nAnd while Democrats increasingly rely on college-educated voters, young people and people of color to supply their margins of victory in general elections, the party as a whole remains 56% white and 48% over the age of 50. Sixty-five percent of Democrats don\u2019t have a college degree. All of those demographic attributes, in Gallup\u2019s polling, are more associated with moderate and conservative Democrats than with liberal ones.\n\nHis speech to the IBEW demonstrated how Biden plans to use a message of nostalgia and not-especially-liberal populism to win these voters over. Biden talked about a smattering of specific policies \u2015 he wants to make community college free and continue his Obama-era \u201cmoonshot\u201d to \u201cend cancer as we know it\u201d \u2015 but focused more on rhetoric designed to evoke the political phrase of the moment, \u201cthe dignity of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so damn sophisticated. We\u2019ve gotten so damn elitist,\u201d he said, before oddly choosing to specify a time period where he served as a powerful member of the Senate and as vice president: \u201cI hate the way things have changed over the last 15 to 20 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow have we got to the place where people like you\u201d \u2015 Biden went on to list nearly every single conceivable union job, from plumbers to firefighters to nurses \u2015 \u201chow the hell did we get to place where a lot of you don\u2019t think the rest of the country sees you, or hears you, or knows you, or maybe most importantly, respects you?\u201d\n\nThis type of rhetoric drew multiple rounds of applause from the IBEW crowd, even as Twitter denizens were more focused on their disgust with Biden\u2019s joke. That gap could be instructive. Last week, the Democratic centrist group Third Way released polling show a significant ideological gap between Democrats on the social media service and those who don\u2019t use it. While non-tweeting Democrats preferred a candidate who appealed to a broad coalition versus one who moved to the left by a 57 percentage point margin, the preference was just 27 percentage points among Twitter users. On the question of abolishing ICE, voters who didn\u2019t use Twitter opposed it by a 34 percentage point margin. Those on Twitter supported it by 3 percentage points.\n\nBiden, who has a questionable progressive record on everything from bank regulation to criminal justice to the Iraq War, was never going to win over the far-left. But his speech on Friday seemed to make clear that despite his recent boast that he was the \u201cmost progressive\u201d candidate in the field, he\u2019s not actually going to try. He\u2019s aiming at a different cohort of Democrats \u2015 older, less ideological and perhaps more male \u2015 than candidates like California Sen. Kamala Harris or former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. The strategy, if it is one, is already working: A recent Quinnipiac University poll found Biden leading the crowded Democratic field with 29% of the prospective vote. The two groups he performed best with? Voters over 50, and those identifying as conservative or moderate.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of reason to be skeptical of Biden\u2019s approach. Biden is counting on the Democratic Party remaining static, but earlier iterations of the party have already rejected two of his presidential bids. The party has undoubtedly moved to the left in recent years, and even if voters find his ideology acceptable, they may object to his preferred tactic of befriending and cajoling Republican politicians into cutting deals.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that the winds have shifted in the Democratic Party away from compromising with the Republican Party and corporate donors and toward the grassroots progressive movement,\u201d Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s because \u2018centrists\u2019 like him are the last to shift with the winds.\u201d\n\nAnd the demographics Biden is counting on are shrinking. While white voters are still 56% of the Democratic Party, that\u2019s down from 68% during the last decade. The percentage of the party with a college degree has risen from 27% to 35%. Even other unions are likely to be more skeptical of Biden. While the IBEW and other trade unions are receptive to his pitch, diverse labor groups like the Service Employees International Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers will want to hear more about immigration rights and expect a more aggressive approach to dealing with the GOP.\n\nStanding outside the Hilton, gabbing with reporters, Biden acknowledged his success was an open question.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out whether I can win in a primary,\u201d he said.", "description": "As many on the left expressed disgust over the former vice president\u2019s joke, a union crowd ate it up.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ca79360240000a2074f6474.jpeg?cache=9zr1qpl1ky&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-04-05"}
