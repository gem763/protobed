But that's exactly what some residents of Ripon, Wisconsin, found in their mailbox.\n\nThe letter was from an attorney representing the estate of Dennis Valstad. Dennis, who at one point owned the local dry cleaner, died a few months ago at the age of 69. To most people, Dennis seemed to be a man of modest means.\n\nBut he secretly amassed a small fortune. Although it wasn't just the size of his estate that brought us here, it was the directions he left behind for what to do with it.\n\n\"Provision number 5: The sum of $500,000 to be divided equally to the individuals that attend my funeral,\" said Don Jorgenson, executor of the estate, reading from the letter.\n\nDennis Valstad The Ripon Commonwealth-Press\n\nThat's all you had to do was show up?\n\n\"Yeah, that's it,\" Don said.\n\nJust attend the church service or simply set foot in the funeral home and sign the registry \u2014 and the money was yours. Of course, no one knew this in advance, and Dennis had no wife or kids \u2014 so there was no reason for him to expect a large turnout.\n\nTo that point, Don also found Dennis' New Year's resolutions.\n\n\"Live a life that is pleasing to God,\" it said.\n\nThat's things he wanted to accomplish this year?\n\n\"Yea. Find true friends \u2014 not be lonely,\" Don said.\n\nThose people who did love him enough to attend his funeral, this was a thank you.\n\n\"Yea,\" Don said.\n\nHe would have been pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Darn right he would,\" Don said.\n\nRipon, Wisconsin residents. The Ripon Commonwealth-Press\n\nThis is the registry. Dennis may not have had a lot of close friends \u2014 but he was endlessly kind and all these people appreciated that. Two-hundred-seventy of them attended his services. Now, each one will get about $1,800 \u2014 and this bonus.\n\n\"It's going to motivate people to be more giving, more loving, more understanding,\" Don said.\n\nAnd that's the real gift here. That reminder \u2014 although a funeral is an important time show someone you care, there is one time better \u2014 sooner.\n\nTo contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com.", "description": "Dennis Valstad had amassed a small fortune in his life \u2014 and he wanted to use it to thank the people who attended his funeral", "authors": ["Steve Hartman"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/99f0b960-0dc9-4165-91c4-bdb8a8afe234/thumbnail/1200x630/ece4ca9856b9036d7db74a78685c20b3/dennis3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
