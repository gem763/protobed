The largest cabin in its luxury range is the 'family hut', priced at just under \u00a331,000, which is of a similar size to Ramsays' concept design\n\nA planning permission pack submitted to the council said: 'It would provide semi-independent self-contained accommodation for the applicant's family and visiting friends but used as accommodation incidental to the enjoyment of the main property.\n\n'Providing space for a bed, kitchen/living room area and toilet, the outbuilding would have a insulated wooden frame faced externally with spruce shingles and finished internally with aspen wall panelling and an insulated floor.\n\n'It would be 2.3 metres high, 8.7 metres long and 2.3 metres wide with an internal floor space of 16.6 metres square.'\n\nThe luxury pods have one bedroom (pictured), a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom and are quickly becoming the must-have celebrity home accessory\n\nThe application was approved by Cornwall Council with the caveats that work must begin within the next three years and that the structure can only be used for or non-paying guests\n\nRamsay has so far spent more than \u00a310million on property in Cornwall since 2015 after buying three properties.\n\nHe demolished the original 1920s house that was on the plot in Trebetherick after he bought it for \u00a34.4million in 2016.\n\nHe is now also building a multi-million pound home in Rock and has recently completed renovations on an old bank building in Fowey.\n\nThe TV chef was also given permission to build an igloo cabin at his \u00a37million eight-bedroom home in Battersea, London, just last week\n\nHis proposals had previously been rejected after he failed to include a tree survey. Pictured: The planning application for the igloo at his London home made on behalf of 'G + T Ramsay' showing the almost 30ft long structure\n\nIt was not until last week that his plans were finally given the go ahead in London after being advised to arrange a meeting with arboriculturalists. Pictured: The floorplan of the luxury pod\n\nThis is just the second igloo cabin project that the star has had approved.\n\nIn April earlier this year the chef lodged plans for a fully furnished log cabin to be installed in the back garden of his \u00a37million eight-bedroom home in Battersea, London.\n\nHis plans were originally rejected after Wandsworth Council said that he had not included a tree survey to evaluate how the development would impact trees and vegetation in his garden.\n\nDavid Beckham spent \u00a314,000 on a Triple Sauna from the Estonian company Iglucraft for the Cotswolds mansion where he spends downtime with Victoria and their children\n\nThe Beckhams apparently took the plunge with their Scandinavian steam bath after David had a go in Ritchie's hot room at the director's 50th birthday party at his country estate in Wiltshire\n\nIt was not until last week that his plans were finally given the go ahead after being advised to arrange a meeting with arboriculturalists who would inspect the surrounding vegetation.\n\nRamsay appears to be following a trend set by David Beckham and Guy Ritchie who have both had igloo cabins installed at their country homes in Oxfordshire and Wiltshire respectively.\n\nThey too bought from the same Estonian suppliers before posting the pictures on social media.", "description": "The TV Chef has been given permission to build the igloo cabin at his seaside home in Trebetherick, Cornwall.
