That investigation focuses on the president\u2019s effort to extract information about Hunter Biden\u2019s job on a Ukrainian gas company\u2019s board at a time when his father was overseeing U.S. policy in that country. Given Trump\u2019s comments, investigators may want to learn whether the president similarly sought information about the Bidens in China.\n\nIn remarks to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday morning, Trump said he discussed Biden\u2019s China work with Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the investment company Blackstone.\n\n\u201cI was with the head of Blackstone . . . Steve Schwarzman,\u201d Trump said, according to a video of the remarks obtained by The Washington Post. After alleging that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese, Trump said he asked Schwarzman, \u201cSteve, is that possible?\u201d Trump said Schwarzman asked, \u201cWho got that?\u201d and Trump responded, \u201cBiden\u2019s son.\u201d\n\nTrump said he asked Schwarzman how that could happen, and the executive responded: \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t get involved, you know it\u2019s very political.\u201d\n\nSchwarzman declined to comment. His spokeswoman, Jennifer Friedman, said in a statement that \u201cSteve never spoke to the President about Joe Biden or his family, nor has he had any conversations with the Chinese about Biden or his family.\u201d\n\nSchwarzman wrote in his just-published autobiography, \u201cWhat It Takes,\u201d that he traveled to Beijing eight times in 2018 \u201con behalf\u201d of the Trump administration during trade negotiations. He is unofficially known as Trump\u2019s \u201cChina whisperer.\u201d\n\nSchwarzman for years has declined to comment about his many conversations with Trump, so it is unusual for him to dispute Trump\u2019s description of the supposed exchange.\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, said Trump\u2019s remarks were part of a pattern of spreading untruths about Hunter Biden, and he criticized Trump for \u201cdiscussing his discredited conspiracy theories with an unaccountable, private envoy to a foreign country.\u201d\n\nTrump for months has alleged that Hunter Biden has made a fortune from business dealings in Ukraine and China due to his father\u2019s connections.\n\nEarlier this week, a summary of Trump\u2019s telephone conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president showed that he wanted an investigation into the younger Biden, who got a job at a gas company in that country when his father handled U.S. policy there.\n\nSix months before Hunter Biden got the job in Ukraine, he arrived in Beijing on Air Force Two with his father, who had traveled to China to talk with that country\u2019s officials. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of an investment firm whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm planned to raise $1.5 billion.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, George Mesires, said that his client did not acquire a financial stake in the investment company until October 2017, a 10 percent holding that was worth $430,000 in July. At least half of the firm\u2019s stake is owned by Chinese entities, according to business records. Mesires said in a statement to The Post earlier this week that his client \u201chas not received any return or compensation\u201d from the investment.\n\nNonetheless, Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have for months said that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion for the fund and have cited it as evidence of what they call corruption.\n\nGiuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who has been actively involved in urging Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, said in an interview that he had done no investigation of Hunter Biden in China, had not spoken with any Chinese officials and had not traveled to the country to look into the matter.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said that Hunter Biden \u201cwalks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China and he\u2019s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that\u2019s a horrible thing. I think it\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d\n\nThen, speaking privately to members of the U.S. Mission at the United Nations on Thursday, he recounted his conversation about Hunter Biden\u2019s actions with Schwarzman.\n\n\u201cI say, \u2018Steve, what happens when you come off a vice-presidential plane, it\u2019s called Air Force Two, your father\u2019s with you, you walk into a room in China and they give you a fund of $1.5 billion, billion; you make hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars off that.\u2019 And that\u2019s probably not all they gave him. They gave him plenty more, I\u2019m sure. We might never find out.\u201d\n\nSchwarzman runs Blackstone, one of the world\u2019s largest investment firms. When it went public in 2007, a company controlled by the Chinese government bought a 9.9 percent stake, which has since been sold. Blackstone continued to have interests in China, and Schwarzman has helped endow a masters program at the Beijing campus of Tsinghua University.\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump has alleged the former vice president\u2019s son got $1.5 billion from China for an investment fund, a claim refuted by Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer.", "authors": ["Michael Kranish", "National Political Investigative Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rJ_eWfITaME7UHFIFVCnZmJsv0U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DRKYQ6XBLII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
