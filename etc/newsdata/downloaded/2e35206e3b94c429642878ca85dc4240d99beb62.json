Zelda reads all your letters but regrets that she cannot answer them all personally\n\nWhy does my first love still have a hold over me?\n\nWhen I was 18, I briefly dated and lived with a boy of the same age while we were training to be nurses. We split up because he wasn\u2019t faithful. At a party, he and a girl I had been friends with since primary school disappeared for an hour and a half. It was obvious what they were up to and I felt that I had lost two important people. I am now 65 and although he has contacted me over the years to suggest meeting, I have always resisted, as I felt he could have multiple personality issues and that he was an alcoholic. While I switched careers and have been successful, at one point he was homeless and almost died. He is now a businessman and contacted me again recently. I was tempted to hear his story but still reluctant to see him so we have had many conversations on the phone. He has showered me with love letters, calls, gifts and compliments but I am shocked at the depravity of his life \u2013 sex and gambling addictions, pornography, stalking behaviour and sexual encounters with women in hotel rooms. I love the attention and his sense of humour but when I refuse to meet him he becomes hard and cold. He has now given me an ultimatum to see him or he will end contact. I don\u2019t know why I have not given up on him altogether but I do miss the funny, sweet boy he used to be.\n\nIt is strange how a first love can often exert a hold on people. Perhaps the reason you can\u2019t let go is that you are clinging to a dream. You remember him as he was when you first met and fell in love. This is what (perhaps subconsciously) you are hoping to resurrect. In your longer letter it is clear that, along with all the issues, he was a lot of fun when he wanted to be. However, you know that he will never change. His ultimatum just demonstrates the unpleasant, controlling side to his nature. I wonder, too, if you have never found a love that quite matches up. You talk of your successful career but you do not mention if you have ever married or fallen in love since \u2013 or had children. Perhaps there is a gap and you are lonely. He obviously still has a place in your heart but if you did get back together, though it might work initially, he would probably become the controlling man that I fear he is, which would make you very unhappy. Also, a domineering partner is extremely difficult to end a relationship with \u2013 even if it is not working well and you know you want to leave. It might be better to cut off contact once and for all, on your terms, and look for a love that has perhaps eluded you.

How can I stop him? He has had a tough time at school, never really fitting in with the other boys or seeming interested in anything. He did badly in his GCSEs and is hating studying for his A-levels so is very reluctant to continue with them. I think he has seen the television recruitment adverts that portray a sense of community and he wants to be a part of something important. Now my husband is saying that he has had enough of our son lazing around the house and that perhaps he should sign up after all. I\u2019m so worried.\n\nI understand your fears. The Army could be a fantastic career that may give him a sense of achievement and make him, as well as you and his father, very proud \u2013 but it is tough and comes with risks. However, it should be something that he really wants to do, not just because he can\u2019t think of anything else. Teenagers are very headstrong so don\u2019t tell him that you think it is a bad idea. Talk \u2013 and really listen \u2013 to him about how he is feeling and what he wants to do. Reassure him that you love him and will support him whatever. He is probably feeling demotivated and a failure if he is struggling at school. He also sounds lonely and possibly depressed, so get him to see his GP about this. The website studential.com has a list of frequently asked questions about joining the Army and also a section on volunteering, which could give him a sense of purpose and help him to build his confidence.", "description": "When I was 18, I briefly dated and lived with a boy of the same age while we were training to be nurses.
