Countries and businesses who want to take full advantages of the BRI need to understand China fundamentally from political, economic and social points of view, he said.\n\nFollowed by Zhang's speech, delegates also heard from Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center, and Martin Jacques, senior fellow in Political and International Studies at Cambridge University, sharing their views about the BRI.\n\n\"Interpreters from the outside often ascribe too much central direction to the BRI,\" said Mitter. \"Their idea might be three people in Beijing control everything. I don't think this is the case at all.\"\n\nFrom Mitter's perspective, the key issue about the BRI is whether or not different elements of all demands can really be coordinated.\n\n\"The BRI constitutes not a new international system, but a way of thinking about a new international system based on the majority of the world's population,\" Jacques added. \"We have to learn from China. But what we learn and how we learn is a very difficult question.\"", "description": "The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, or the BRI, offers huge potential to other countries, and more efforts need to be put into getting this message across, one of China's leading academics told a conference at Oxford Brookes University on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da69b91a310cf3e97a17876.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
