They don't want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security. And they want the wall. They want the wall.\"\n\nThroughout the speech Trump launched into an ad-libbed dialogue with Steve Cortes, a CNN commentator and long-time supporter who is a member of Trump's Hispanic advisory committee, and was in the crowd.\n\n\"He happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do,\" Trump said.\n\nRead more: Latinos in El Paso after the mass shooting are not living in fear \u2014 instead they're outraged at Trump\n\nSteve Cortes was in the crowd at Trump's rally in New Mexico Monday. Screenshot/Fox News\n\nShouting to Cortes across the arena, Trump said: \"Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\"\n\nCortes' response was inaudible, so Trump answered for him.\n\n\"He says the country,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote.\"\n\nTrump later claimed that Hispanic Americans support his border wall because they understand the US \"drug crisis\" better than other Americans.\n\n\"At the center of America's drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody. People said: 'Oh, the Hispanics won't like a wall.' I said: 'I think they are going to love it,'\" said Trump.\n\n\"You know why? Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people don't understand it.\"\n\nRead more: Most Americans don't approve of Trump, but here are 3 countries where they love what he's doing\n\nTrump launched his presidential campaign back in 2015 with a notorious press conference in which he branded migrants from Mexico attempting to enter the US \"criminals\" and \"rapists.\"\n\nHis support among Hispanic Americans has remained low, with a recent Pew survey finding that only around 20% of Hispanics approve of the job Trump is doing.\n\nHe is campaigning in New Mexico as part of a plan to offset potential losses in swing states that narrowly handed him victory in 2016 should they swing back to the Democratic Party in 2020.", "description": "\"I don't know, I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you.
