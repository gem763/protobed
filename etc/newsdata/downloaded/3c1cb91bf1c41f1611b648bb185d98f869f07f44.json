Quite a few players were face-to-face when the flag flew. Referee Mike Defee announced the penalty, and the warning of an ejection for any more unsportsmanlike calls.\n\nIt\u2019s the 115th meeting between the longtime rivals, and the 92nd at Cotton Bowl Stadium in the middle of the Texas state fair.\n\nDefee re-issued the warning to the captains during the coin flip: \u201cWe\u2019re going to play this game with sportsmanship. Are we clear?\u201d\n\nThe teams ran to the same tunnel together after the flag was thrown, but there weren\u2019t any noticeable scuffles as OU players bunched up while the Longhorns went single file up the ramp.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The entire teams for No. 6 Oklahoma and 11th-ranked Texas were issued an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty 30 minutes before the annual Red River rivalry, meaning any player getting flagged for the same thing during the game will be ejected.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/oklahoma_texas_football_32888_c0-232-5563-3477_s1200x700.jpg?a79d3c1843eab803f1e795ff8d2af2150311d13e", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
