In a livestreamed discussion, Zuckerberg said that one of the challenges involved with cutting-edge research for labs and biotech start-ups is the high cost of computing services. While it's now cheaper than ever to sequence human DNA and generate data on our biological makeup, it's become extremely expensive to store and analyze all the information.\n\nIn particular, Zuckerberg called out Amazon Web Services, the leader in public cloud, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for the high costs of using the company's infrastructure.\n\n\"One of the things we talk about is our cost of compute and our AWS bill,\" Zuckerberg said, in a chat with the research center's co-presidents, Dr. Joseph DeRisi and Dr. Stephen Quake. \"Let's call up Jeff and talk about this.\"\n\nCZI, a research center based in San Francisco, has a broad array of projects underway, ranging from cell biology to early stage cancer research. Zuckerberg is selling billions of dollars in Facebook stock to fund the initiative. The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a collaboration with biomedical research institutions, is funded by additional benefactors including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.", "description": "While it's cheaper than ever to sequence human DNA, Mark Zuckerberg says CZI spends a ton on Amazon cloud services to store the data.", "authors": ["Christina Farr"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105341117-1532025957771gettyimages-962142748.jpeg?v=1568724769", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
