I span around and saw this guy who had a knife in his hand.\n\n\u2018It looked like he had stabbed her back. There was blood pouring from her and she just fell to the floor.\n\n\u2018As soon as I saw the knife I just ran as fast as I could and was warning others what happened.\n\n\u2018Everyone was looking down from the first floor and there was real panic, people screaming.\n\n\u2018The police were there in minutes and then we were evacuated. It was like a nightmare. Like something out of a horror film.\n\n\u2018It was awful. I can\u2019t get that image out of my head.\u2019\n\nA man in his 40s has been detained under the Mental Health Act (Picture: John Greenhalgh)\n\nThe suspect was detained by armed officers within five minutes in nearby Corporation Street at the side of Marks & Spencer.\n\nA man in his 50s, a woman, 19, and another woman were rushed to hospital with stab wounds, but none of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening.\n\nThe suspect was arrested on suspicion of assault and then re-arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism.\n\nPolice later said he had been detained under the Mental Health Act, following an assessment \u2018by specialist doctors\u2019.\n\nAssistant chief constable Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: \u2018We do not know the motivation for this terrible attack.\n\nAnimal rights activists shut down market entrance in 'vigil' for dead fish\n\n\u2018It appears random, is certainly brutal and of course extremely frightening for anyone who witnessed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At this time we do not believe that there is anyone else involved in this attack but we will be constantly keeping this under review.\n\n\u2018We have specially trained officers supporting those injured from the attack.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll have increased patrols, including armed patrols, in the city centre this weekend.\u2019\n\nHe appealed for anyone who was in the Arndale at the time to send any images or footage taken from the scene via the force\u2019s website.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
