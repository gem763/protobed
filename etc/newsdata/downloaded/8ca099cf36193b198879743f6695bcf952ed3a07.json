One said top officials at the Defense Department were 'completely blindsided' and 'shocked' by the order.\n\nThe National Security Council source, who labelled Turkey 'playground bullies', told Newsweek President Trump 'was definitely out-negotiated'.\n\nThey said Trump 'only endorsed the troop withdraw to make it look like we are getting something but we are not getting something', adding: 'The U.S. national security has entered a state of increased danger for decades to come because the president has no spine and that's the bottom line.'\n\nOne official described that White House announcement as a botched effort appeared aimed at making Trump look bold for ending a war. The official said attempts by the Pentagon and State Department to make the statement stronger in its opposition to Turkey's military action were unsuccessful.\n\n'Spineless' Donald Trump, left, 'got rolled' by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, on Syria, according to one National Security Council source with direct knowledge of their call\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' armoured vehicles carrying Turkish commandos move towards to Syrian border as they are being dispatched to support the units at border in Kilis Monday\n\nTrump has been forced to brush off GOP fury at Kurdish betrayal after the regime of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad claimed Monday through state-run media that Turkey began launching aerial attacks across the border.\n\nThe president defended his decision as unconfirmed reports of airstrikes blanketed Twitter, largely traceable back to unverified amateur video. Syrian government-run SANA TV called it 'Turkish aggression' targeting the 'north-eastern countryside' of Syria where some Kurdish forces are based.\n\nClaims of airstrikes are likely to inflame tensions between Trump and Republicans with a swathe of senior party figures including Mitch McConnell, Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham breaking with the president for pulling U.S. troops out - with Mitt Romney calling it a 'betrayal.'\n\nRepublican allies of the president lined up to express their outrage at the the result for Syria's Kurdish minority who will soon find themselves trapped in a geographic squeeze without America's continued backing.\n\nThe source added: 'When the bigger guy [United States] moves aside in the playground, they [Turkey] get to beat on the smaller guy [Syrian Defense Forces] and this is not about the U.S. being the world police.\n\n'We are telling the world, we will use you and then throw you away. It's not like they don't have a television in Asia, in Africa, and South America.'\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' armoured vehicles carrying Turkish commandos move towards to Syrian border at Turkey's Kirikhan and Hassa districts of Hatay.\n\nThe area inhabited by Kurdish people straddles Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia, and the area currently controlled by the Kurds crosses over Iraq and Syria. Turkey fears an independent Kurdish state would threaten its security\n\nTrump and Erogdan spoke in a scheduled phone call on Sunday afternoon where POTUS confirmed he would withdraw US troops from northern Syria following the news Turkey was planning to invade the country.\n\nThe chat came hours after Turkish troops at their border with Syria were reinforced.\n\nUS involvement in Syria The United States' involvement in Syria has been fraught with peril since it started in 2014 with the insertion of small numbers of special operations forces to recruit, train, arm and advise local fighters to combat the Islamic State. Trump entered the White House in 2017 intent on getting out of Syria, and even before the counter-IS military campaign reclaimed the last militant strongholds early this year, he declared victory and said troops would leave. Trump defended his latest decision, acknowledging in tweets that 'the Kurds fought with us' but adding that they 'were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.'\n\nOne official familiar with the Erdogan call said the Turkish president was 'ranting' at Trump, saying the safe zone was not working and that Turkey couldn't trust the U.S. military to do what was needed. And in reaction, Trump said the U.S. wanted no part of an invasion and would withdraw troops.\n\nThe Newsweek source also claims that while the president did not give his support to Turkish military operation against Kurdish Forces he also did not threaten economic sanctions while speaking to Erogdan Sunday if they did o.\n\nThis contradicts Trump's claims to reporters at the White House on Monday that he had told Erogdan \u2013 presumably during a Sunday phone call \u2013 that there would be consequences if harm comes to the dozens of remaining American servicemen and women there.\n\nHe warned Erdogan: 'I don't want anything bad to happen to our people' during the troop withdrawal, and promised 'big trouble' if casualties result.'\n\nTrump mainly washed his hands of the Syrian military quagmire, saying any resurgence of the ISIS terror army would no longer be America's immediate concern.\n\nCountries in what he said is 'not a friendly neighborhood' will have to make do without the United States, Trump said after signing a trade agreement at the White House.\n\nThe president insisted in social media posts that Turkey must take responsibility for ISIS captives that the U.S. has been holding, and warked that he could crush Turkey's economy if the nation did 'anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits'\n\nPresident Trump played defense on Monday, pushing back against his critics by saying China and Russia will be unhappy with the result and emphasizing that the U.S. military can return to Syria at any time\n\nKurdish forces in Syria currently hold more than 10,000 ISIS fighters prisoner, and the move risks a resurgence of ISIS, Trump's former envoy for the fight against the Islamist army, Brett McGurk, tweeted.\n\nThe Newsweek source also issued a warning regarding ISIS prisoners, telling the website that 'some of them, will eventually be freed amongst the chaos, and remain in the area or go elsewhere to rejoin the fight'.\n\nThey added: 'To be honest with you, it would be better for the United States to support a Kurdish nation across Turkey, Syria and Iraq. It would be another Israel in the region.'\n\nTrump said the explosive disassembly of the ISIS caliphate had left tens of thousands of people in custody including both soldiers and civilians, 'and we can't release them.'\n\n'I told president Erdogan, 'It's going to be your responsibility,' he said of Turkey's leader.\n\nPresident Trump was definitely out-negotiated and only endorsed the troop withdraw to make it look like we are getting something\u2014but we are not getting something. National Security Council source\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement: 'The Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2013 as did the President \u2013 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria. The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation.'\n\nWithin hours Turkey was reportedly denying unverified video on Twitter suggesting that it may have launched airstrikes on the Syrian border.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's closest friends in Congress, also blasted him in a tweet, calling the move 'a stain on America's honor' and 'a disaster in the making.'\n\nEven televangelist Pat Robertson, a longtime conservative voice among Bible-belt Christians, issued a televised slap.\n\nGraham quickly challenged Trump's great and unmatched wisdom,' taunting him about being 'unwise' by leaving the Kurds to die and letting ISIS get off the mat\n\nTexas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a former Trump election rival who hsa since warmed to the president, joined the pile-on with his own criticism on Monday\n\nPhotographs on Sunday of a U.S. military base in the Syrian border village of Tel Arqam showed a virtual ghost town, with American troops bugged out and clearing the way for Turks to invade.\n\nBy morning's end he was mounting a full-throated defense on Twitter, saying his decision would disadvantage Russia and China, and emphasizing that he could order troops to return on short notice.\n\nRepublican fury at 'betrayal' grows Even Trump's staunchest Republican congressional allies expressed outrage at the prospect of abandoning Syrian Kurds who had fought the Islamic State group with American arms and advice. Some focused on potential harm to American interests in the Middle East. Others warned that the troop pullout could doom hundreds of thousands of Kurds to a Turkish genocide. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called his pullout a 'retreat' that 'would increase the risk that ISISand other terrorist groups regroup.' 'The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake,' former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted. 'If reports about US retreat in #Syria are accurate,' Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said in a tweet, 'the Trump administration has made a grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on 'Fox & Friends' that 'I want to make sure we keep our word for those who fight with us and help us,' adding that, 'If you make a commitment and somebody is fighting with you. America should keep their word.' One of the show's hosts, Brian Kilmeade, asked McCarthy to try to intervene and 'call the president before it's too late.' Even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took a shot at Trump on Twitter for leaving the Kurds in the lurch. 'Our enemies and rivals (Iran, Russia, etc.) don't abandon their allies; if we want allies to stand with America in the future, we shouldn't either. Honorable nations stand by their friends,' Cruz tweeted. 'It would also be DISGRACEFUL if we sat idly by while Turkey slaughters the Kurds, as public reports suggest that Turkish leader Erdogan explicitly told President Trump he intends to do.' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's closest friends in Congress, also blasted him in a tweet, calling the move 'a stain on America's honor' and 'a disaster in the making.' 'The biggest lie being told by the administration [is] that ISIS is defeated,' Graham said on 'Fox & Friends,' adding: 'The caliphate is destroyed but there are thousands of fighters over there. And no, the caliphate would not have been destroyed without the Kurds.' 'To say to the American people that ISIS has been destroyed in Syria is not true,' he insisted. Even televangelist Pat Robertson, a longtime conservative voice among Bible-belt Christians, issued a televised slap. Trump, he said, 'is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks.' 'The President of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of Heaven if he permits this to happen,' Robertson added. Trump said he understood criticism from fellow GOP leaders but disagreed. He said he could also name supporters, but he didn't.\n\nHillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and failed 2016 presidential candidate, blasted Trump.\n\n'Let us be clear: The president has sided with authoritarian leaders of Turkey and Russia over our loyal allies and America's own interests,' Clinton tweeted. 'His decision is a sickening betrayal both of the Kurds and his oath of office.'\n\nHer own State Department, however, tweeted on her behalf in 2012 that President Tayyip Erdogan and #Turkey were 'strong stalwarts on behalf of the Syrian people.'\n\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2012, also said leaving the Kurds to twist in the wind would be a 'betrayal.'\n\nErdogan announced the launch of his long-planned offensive on Monday. Trump dug in his heels after announcing the troop withdrawal.\n\n'[I]f Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!),' he boasted.\n\n'They must, with Europe and others, watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!'\n\nTrump had tweeted earlier that 'I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don't even like the USA.'\n\n'The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged down, watching over a quagmire, & spending big dollars to do so. When I took over, our Military was totally depleted. Now it is stronger than ever before. The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!'\n\nTrump had in the early morning justified his decision in a five-part 247-word tweetstorm, framing it as part of a larger policy of pulling U.S. troops out of 'ridiculous Endless Wars' and insisting that the ISIS caliphate is now '100%' defeated.\n\n'WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN, the U.S. president wrote in allcaps.\n\nHe fumed at European allies' refusal to accept the repatriation of their citizens who U.S. forces have captured as fighters for the ISIS terror army.\n\nAnd he appeared unmoved by international concerns that a power vacuum will favor an ISIS resurgence and a Kurdish slaughter.\n\nThe move also left United Nations and European leaders aghast over fears of ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe UN warned Turkey not to allow a civilian massacre on the scale of the Bosnian war after the U.S. announced it would step aside and allow Erogdan to move his troops across the Syrian border.\n\nFears of chaos in refugee camps and Kurdish-controlled prisons followed.\n\nTrump later defended his administration's decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, saying 'the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.'\n\nHe said it was too costly to keep supporting U.S.-allied Kurdish-led forces in the region fighting the Islamic State.\n\n'The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades,' Trump said in a series of tweets. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.'\n\nCivilians must be spared in any Turkish military operation in northeast Syria, where the United Nations hopes that mass displacement and Srebrenica-like killings can be prevented, a senior UN aid official said.\n\nIt was feared the departure of the U.S. from the volatile border region could leave Turkey free to crush the Kurds, who hoped to forge their own state in the aftermath of the defeat of ISIS.\n\nI campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home and bring them home as rapidly as possible. President Donald Trump\n\nU.S. soldiers previously worked closely with Kurdish forces of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the YPG militia, in the battle to destroy Islamic State's caliphate.\n\nBut Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist group and has long threatened to launch an assault on the Kurds as Ankara sees the group's growing power along its border as a threat to its security.\n\nThe U.S. has already warned Kurdish fighters that they will not defend them from any Turkish attack, an unnamed American official has claimed.\n\nRussian said Syria's territorial integrity must be preserved, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated hours after the announcement.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they had been 'stabbed in the back' by a surprise U.S. statement that U.S. forces would not be involved in a Turkish operation in northern Syria, the SDF said.\n\nTurkey said it will not permit ISIS to return, amid fears its threatened offensive against a Kurdish militia in Syria could bolster the jihadists, a presidential spokesman said.", "description": "The official, who is said to have direct knowledge of conversation, labelled the president 'spineless' and said his actions has left the US in 'a state of increased danger for decades to come'.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com", "David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/02/19421232-0-image-a-32_1570499052416.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
