This story is moving with incredible speed. Here's what we know. According to \"The New York Times,\" president trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani is now under federal criminal investigation over his work in Ukraine. Also this morning, the former U.S. Ambassador to the Ukraine has testified before congress saying the president allegedly played a role in ousting her over false claims. And overnight the president himself rallying -- railing, rather, against the impeachment inquiry and the Democrats at a rally in Louisiana. We do have team coverage this morning. We're going to begin with ABC's Kyra Phillips who is on capitol hill. Kyra, good morning to you. Reporter: Good morning to you, Dan. Sources telling ABC news that the business relationship between Giuliani and the men charged in the campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation. This as the chairman of the house intelligence committee Adam Schiff says the impeachment inquiry is now moving with a sense of, quote, urgency and that there will be more witnesses and possibly more subpoenas. The president's outspoken and controversial attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at the center of the Ukraine scandal served with subpoenas, tied to two men now under indictment for alleged illegal campaign contributions. President trump now not clear on whether Giuliani still represents him. Is Giuliani still your personal attorney? Well, I don't know. I haven't spoken to Rudy. I spoke to him yesterday briefly. Reporter: But Giuliani telling me last night, yes, he is still the president's attorney. This as the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie yovanovitch, told congressional investigators she was removed from her job after a year-long pressure campaign by president trump and Giuliani. She told lawmakers she believed she was forced out because of, quote, unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the former But I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time. Not good. Reporter: In the July phone call with the Ukrainian president that sparked this impeachment inquiry, trump called yovanovitch bad news, later saying, she was going to go through some things. Today yovanovitch a career foreign service officer who has served in six administrations said Giuliani was gunning for her. It stems around the ambassador and the embassy being used for political purposes. Reporter: Claiming she was blocking his efforts to dig up dirt on 2020 rival Joe Biden. Her testimony coming just days after these two associates of Giuliani were arrested after trying to leave the country. Giuliani acknowledges they were helping in his investigation. This video from 2018 shows them laughing it up with Giuliani at the trump hotel. See you in Ukraine soon. Reporter: Yovanovitch says those businessmen, quote, may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine. All right. So much here. We're back with Kyra Phillips who is on capitol hill this morning. There's that report in \"The new York Times\" I referenced a few moments ago that says Giuliani is under federal criminal investigation for his work in Ukraine. You've actually been communicating directly with Giuliani this morning. What is he telling you? Reporter: Yeah, that's right. I have been talking with Giuliani this morning and I asked him about that report. He tells me, no, that he has no knowledge that he's under investigation, Dan, and Giuliani also telling me no one from the justice department has contacted him about his associates who were arrested. He says that he has to presume they are innocent. He tells me that none of those facts make any sense to him. So he doesn't know what they mean at this point. He says the men have gone to Vienna at least four times in the last two months and have always returned. He says he has very good reason to believe they were returning this time as well, Dan. Although they had one-way tickets. Kyra Phillips on capitol hill, thank you very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch spent hours testifying behind closed doors with lawmakers as the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani faces new scrutiny.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191012_gma_phillips3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
