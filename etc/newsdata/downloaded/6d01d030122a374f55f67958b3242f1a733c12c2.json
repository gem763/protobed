Meanwhile, Liverpool, Barcelona and Chelsea all failed to score.\n\nHaaland is emerging as one of European soccer\u2019s biggest talents after netting 17 goals in nine games for Salzburg this season.\n\nHe scored in the second minute against Genk and twice more before halftime, tormenting the Belgian side on the counterattack and making Salzburg look like anything but a team which last played in the Champions League in 1994.\n\nWhen Haaland was substituted in the 72nd minute, it was to a standing ovation. At the final whistle, he ran back onto the pitch to more applause and hugs from teammates.\n\nLIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA BEATEN\n\nLast season ended with all-English finals in both of Europe\u2019s main club competitions. But the English are off to a poor start this season.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s prolific front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane misfired as the European champion\u2019s title defense started with a 2-0 loss to Napoli.\n\nLiverpool denied Napoli a place in the Champions League knockout rounds last season and the Italian side got a measure of revenge Tuesday. Dries Mertens\u2019 penalty gave Napoli the lead before Fernando Llorente - who was on the Tottenham team that lost to Liverpool in last season\u2019s final - made it 2-0 in stoppage time.\n\n\u201cOverall, we can be better of course,\u201d Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take responsibility. We\u2019ll move forward and try and react in the right way.\u201d\n\nChelsea was beaten 1-0 by Valencia thanks to a volley from Rodrigo, with Ross Barkley missing a chance to equalize when he fired a penalty onto the crossbar. It was the first European test for the new-look Chelsea team under coach Frank Lampard.\n\nMaking things worse for Chelsea, midfielder Mason Mount went off with an ankle injury after a sliding tackle from Valencia\u2019s Francis Coquelin.\n\nMESSI RETURNS\n\nEven Lionel Messi couldn\u2019t lift Barcelona to a win over Borussia Dortmund.\n\nIn his first appearance of the season following a calf injury, Messi came off the bench to replace 16-year-old Ansu Fati but couldn\u2019t turn the tide in a 0-0 draw.\n\nInstead, Barcelona\u2019s standout player was goalkeeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, who saved a penalty from Marco Reus and made several other saves to keep the game scoreless. Dortmund also struck the crossbar through substitute Julian Brandt.\n\nAJAX BACK IN FORM\n\nAfter a summer of transfers and near-elimination in qualifying, Ajax looked assured on its return to the Champions League group stage.\n\nLast season\u2019s semifinalist is much changed after selling Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt in the summer, but new signings Quincy Promes and Edson Alvarez scored as it beat Lille 3-0.\n\nLeipzig, another club trying to break into Europe\u2019s elite, also had a winning start as it surprisingly beat Benfica 2-1 in Portugal.\n\nTwo goals from Timo Werner, who has scored seven in six games this season, were enough for Leipzig, though Benfica cut the deficit late on with a goal from Haris Seferovic.\n\nLyon drew 1-1 with Zenit St. Petersburg, while Slavia Prague was unlucky not to beat Inter Milan before Nicolo Barella\u2019s header in stoppage time earned a 1-1 draw.\n\nVAR DEBUTS\n\nThe much-debated video assistant referee system made its debut in the Champions League group stage after being used for the knockout stages only last season.\n\nChelsea\u2019s fans cheered the VAR decision to award a penalty as if it were a goal. They weren\u2019t cheering after the resulting spot-kick, however, as Barkley was off target. It was also a factor in Liverpool\u2019s loss, with coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp questioning whether the penalty Mertens scored should have been awarded. He suspected Napoli\u2019s Jose Callejon of exaggerating the contact with Andy Robertson.\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t matter much in the end for Genk, VAR saved the Belgian champion from an even bigger loss when it persuaded the referee to rescind a red card for forward Mbwana Samatta after a reckless sliding tackle.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On a night when Europe's biggest stars couldn't find a way to score, teenager Erling Braut Haaland made it look easy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/austria_soccer_champions_league_06272_c0-193-4615-2883_s1770x1032.jpg?c8ece3b1a3677960a07d82fca88be159e38d7d7d", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
