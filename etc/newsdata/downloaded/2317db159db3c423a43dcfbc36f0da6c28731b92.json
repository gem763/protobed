Three women and three children died in that high-rise blaze in Camberwell, South London which bore many similar traits and where victims were also told to stay put.\n\nSurvivors of the fire and bereaved family members will also hold a press conference this morning as the authorities face a pasting.\n\nMoyra Samuels, from the Justice for Grenfell campaign group, slammed London Fire Brigade [LFB] and demanded answers, saying it was 'obvious' that families should not have been told to 'stay put' as the block burned.\n\nShe told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \u2018It was obviously for us on the outside that they should have been told to evacuate to have a mass evacuation. The LFB are going to have to explain that decision why there was such a huge delay'.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, West London, in June 2017 left 72 people dead\n\nRukayet Mamudu (left), 71, who survived the fire after carrying her son Tyrshondre (both left), 12. London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton (right) is retiring with a \u00a32m pension\n\nShe added: 'I think it\u2019s quite concerning that there\u2019s been an enormous amount of deficits in the LFB acknowledged in the report such as poor communication systems.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick's scathing conclusions over 1,000 pages Sir Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of the Grenfell public inquiry, Cause of blaze It started due to an electrical fault in a fridge-freezer in flat 16 on the fourth floor. Flat owner Behailu Kebede will be absolved of any blame. More than 200 survivors and bereaved families are suing Whirlpool, which supplied the Hotpoint model in the flat. Brigade training The London Fire Brigade's preparation and planning for such a fire was 'gravely inadequate'. Experienced incident commanders had 'no training' on the dangers of combustible cladding or on how to evacuate a high-rise block. At the scene Firefighters displayed 'extraordinary bravery' but incident commanders failed to recognise that a full evacuation may have been necessary. If the decision to evacuate had been made it would have 'resulted in fewer fatalities'. Crucial information was not shared by senior officers. Control room There were 'shortcomings in practice, policy and training'. Call handlers did not always obtain the necessary information and were unaware of when to tell residents to evacuate. Commissioner The report criticises the London Fire Brigade's commissioner for her 'remarkable insensitivity' after she told a hearing in September 2018 she would change nothing about its response to the fire. Inferno's spread The 'principle reason' that the flames spread so quickly up the tower block was due to the rain screen panels which 'acted as a source of fuel'. The insulation boards behind the cladding panels also accelerated the fire's spread. These features were added during a refurbishment several months before the fire. Building design The failures of the building's safety design were 'rapid'. Many lobbies filled with fire 26 minutes after it started. But Sir Martin Moore-Bick said stairs were 'not absolutely impassable' over an hour into it. Regulations The tower's external walls failed to comply with building regulations. There is 'compelling evidence' the walls did not 'accurately resist the spread of fire' but 'actively promoted it'.\n\n\u2018I think what we need is proper research I think the number of high risk buildings across the country with cladding is a massive concern.\n\n\u2018We need some proper research with fire experts fire chiefs we need political will to explain in the case where stay put doesn\u2019t work what should happen'.\n\nYesterday families condemned the London Fire Brigade boss for retiring with a \u00a32million pension pot.\n\nThey claim fire commissioner Dany Cotton, who was heavily criticised by the official report into the tragedy which claimed 72 lives, has been 'paid off for doing a deadly job'.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the report would bring 'some measure of comfort' to those directly affected by the fire.\n\nHe said: 'They asked for the truth. We promised them the truth. We owe them the truth.\n\n'And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017.\n\n'For the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community, this report will prove particularly harrowing.\n\n'Yet I hope it strengthens their faith in the inquiry's desire to determine the facts of the fire - and in this government's commitment to airing those facts in public, no matter how difficult they may be, and acting on them.\n\n'That commitment is absolute.'\n\nThe report, which was leaked yesterday, found that systemic failures by the LFB increased the number of deaths because it told residents to 'stay put' in flats for almost two hours after the first 999 call.\n\nMiss Cotton was lambasted in the report for 'remarkable insensitivity' in her evidence to the public inquiry in September last year.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge who chaired the inquiry, said her attitude meant the brigade was at risk of failing to learn the lessons from Grenfell. He also highlighted her apparent lack of curiosity on arriving at the inferno at around 3am on June 14, 2017.\n\nShe was told the notorious 'stay-put' advice had just been abandoned, but asked no follow-up questions. Miss Cotton, whose annual pay package is worth \u00a3234,000, provoked anger when she told the inquiry she 'would not change anything we did on the night'. The 50-year-old fire chief is retiring in April on a full pension estimated to be worth up to \u00a32million after 32 years of service. She will have served as commissioner for three years and three months \u2013 six years fewer than her predecessor, Ron Dobson, who continued until he was 57.\n\nRukayet Mamudu, 71, who escaped in her dressing gown carrying her adopted 12-year-old son, said Miss Cotton should be stripped of her pension.\n\n'She should not get any pay-off,' she said. 'She should not be paid off for doing a deadly job. I am very angry. Dany Cotton should be made to pay the consequences of the fire brigade being so unprepared and for their inflexibility and failure to respond to events on the ground.'\n\nA graphic showing the people who died on the various floors of Grenfell Tower, most of whom were told not to leave their flats\n\nThe 72 confirmed victims who died in the Grenfell Tower fire.

He said: 'She doesn't deserve it. Her not doing her job, or what she should have done, resulted in a lot of people dying.\n\n'And she deserves an early retirement payout? I don't think so. I don't think she's setting a good example. She's just showing how if something goes wrong, this is how you get out of it \u2013 by retiring early. Whoever is responsible needs to be held accountable \u2013 not rewarded.'\n\nBrigade union: Firefighters have been made scapegoats for blaze Firefighters claimed yesterday that they are being made scapegoats after the Grenfell report condemned the actions of the London Fire Brigade. They said that those who raced up the burning tower 'did their best to save lives' and that the 'real culprits are yet to be held to account'. A fire union chief said the inquiry was 'back to front' because firefighters were being criticised ahead of those responsible for the flammable cladding. The first part of the report concluded that systemic failures by the LFB caused a greater number of deaths. It found that the slavish adherence to the controversial 'stay put' policy by fire chiefs prevented escape. But firefighters said that the policy was introduced by the Government and accused ministers of evading criticism. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigade Union, said: 'The issues behind the fire go back 30 years or more and lie at the heart of central government. Firefighters are being subjected to a degree of scrutiny which ministers are avoiding.' He said Grenfell was the first mass evacuation of a residential building in Britain. Up to 55 of the 72 who died are thought to have been told to stay in flats for almost two hours after the first 999 call. Sir Martin Moore-Bick found that a full evacuation should have been implemented at least an hour before the order was given. But many firefighters disagreed on social media. Paul Embery said: 'Firefighters didn't weaken safety regulations, nor fix flammable cladding to the tower.'\n\nMiss Cotton, who became the fire brigade's first female commissioner in 2017, has previously compared the sight of flames ripping through the tower block to a 'disaster movie'. She said the fire was 'the most difficult thing' she had dealt with in her career, saying that she has suffered memory loss and received counselling.\n\nIn her testimony, she also claimed no training could have prepared the fire crews, saying: 'I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard.'\n\nSir Martin's report describes the lack of training at the fire services as an 'institutional' failure. He concludes: 'Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped, the commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB, even with hindsight, serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the fire.'\n\nHe also says Miss Cotton's evidence 'betrayed an unwillingness to confront the fact that by 2017 the LFB knew (even if she personally did not) that there was a more than negligible risk of a serious fire in a high-rise building with a cladding system'.\n\nMiss Cotton joined the brigade aged 18 as one of 30 female London firefighters.\n\nThe 935-page report into events on the night is published today. Sir Martin makes 46 recommendations following a two-year investigation. He says the 'principal reason' why the flames shot up the 24-storey high rise was the combustible aluminium cladding used in the refurbishment.\n\nThe report also concludes the fire started as the result of an 'electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer' in a fourth floor flat.\n\nPart two of the inquiry examining the circumstances and causes of the disaster begins in January. An LFB spokesman said it would be 'inappropriate' to comment on the findings ahead of its official release.\n\nGrenfell Tower in West London burns hours after the blaze swept through it in June 2017\n\nThe failures that meant lives were needlessly sacrificed: Litany of shortcomings led to 72 deaths in Grenfell horror\n\nFire chiefs are castigated in Sir Martin Moore-Bick\u2019s 935-page report into the devastating blaze.\n\nThe London Fire Brigade was plagued with \u2018institutional failures\u2019 and its preparation for a Grenfell-style inferno was \u2018gravely inadequate\u2019, the retired judge found.\n\nBut he also ruled the tower\u2019s cladding panels broke building regulations and actively helped spread the blaze. Among his findings:\n\nHow the blaze started\n\nThe Grenfell tragedy started with an electrical fault in the fridge-freezer of Flat 16, occupied by Behailu Kebede, pictured here leaving his flat on the day of the fire. The report said that Kebede was not responsible for what followed\n\nThe Grenfell tragedy started with an electrical fault in the fridge-freezer of Flat 16, but its occupant Behailu Kebede was not to blame, the report says.\n\nSir Martin said it was more important to establish \u2018how the failure of a common domestic appliance could have such disastrous consequences\u2019.\n\n\u2018Inadequate\u2019 fire planning\n\nThe firefighters who repeatedly ran into the burning building were praised for their \u2018extraordinary bravery and selfless devotion to duty\u2019.\n\nBut they were let down by having no training for a fire of such magnitude.\n\nSir Martin said: \u2018The London Fire Brigade\u2019s preparation and planning for a fire such as that at Grenfell Tower was gravely inadequate.\u2019 Officers were faced \u2018with a situation for which they had not properly been prepared\u2019, and commanders had \u2018no training\u2019 on the dangers associated with combustible cladding.\n\nNor did they have any training on how to recognise the need for an evacuation of a high-rise block \u2013 let alone mount one. Sir Martin said there was simply \u2018no contingency plan\u2019 for evacuation.\n\nThe fire service\u2019s database on large London buildings was \u2018many years out of date\u2019 and contained \u2018almost no information of use\u2019.\n\nSafety design flaws\n\nFirefighters spray water onto the Grenfell Tower block which was destroyed in a disastrous fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 16, 2017\n\nThis picture of the Grenfell Tower six months after the blaze shows the damage to the external building. There was a catastrophic failure of \u2018compartmentation\u2019 \u2013 the safety design that supposedly stops fires spreading from flat to flat. The tower\u2019s outside walls failed to comply with building regulations. There was \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 that the walls did not \u2018adequately resist the spread of fire \u2013 on the contrary, they actively promoted it\u2019\n\nFlames and smoke billow as firefighters deal with a serious fire in the Grenfell Tower apartment block at Latimer Road in West London, Britain June 14, 2017\n\nThere was a catastrophic failure of \u2018compartmentation\u2019 \u2013 the safety design that supposedly stops fires spreading from flat to flat.\n\nHad compartmentation worked, it would have contained the blaze in the first flat until firefighters could put it out, enabling occupants elsewhere to \u2018stay put\u2019.\n\nThe \u2018rapid\u2019 failure of compartmentation meant the intensity of the heat shattered glass windows. Kitchen extractor fans were deformed and dislodged, giving the flames a deadly pathway. Fire doors at the front of flats failed in their job, filling lobbies with smoke.\n\nStay-put strategy\n\nLives were probably lost because crews and 999 operators wasted \u2018the best part of an hour\u2019 telling the block\u2019s occupants to \u2018stay put\u2019 in their flats \u2013 before realising the blaze was wildly out of control, the report says.\n\nIncident commanders failed to recognise that compartmentation had failed and a full evacuation may have been necessary. They never gained control.\n\nSir Martin says of the stay-put strategy: \u2018Once it was clear that the fire was out of control and that compartmentation had failed, a decision should have been taken to organise the evacuation.\n\nThat decision should have been made between 1.30am and 1.50am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities.\u2019\n\nHe said \u2018the best part of an hour was lost\u2019 before the stay-put advice was revoked at 2.47am.\n\nPictured are the ashened lifts inside the Grenfell tower. Lives were probably lost because crews and 999 operators wasted \u2018the best part of an hour\u2019 telling the block\u2019s occupants to \u2018stay put\u2019 in their flats \u2013 before realising the blaze was wildly out of control, the report says\n\nComms shortfalls\n\nMany physical and electronic communication systems did not work properly on the night of the fire. Information sharing between the control room and the commanders on the ground was \u2018improvised, uncertain and prone to error\u2019.\n\nCrucial information about the spread and extent of the fire was not shared by senior officers at the scene \u2013 and they were not kept abreast of vital information that was coming in to the 999 centre from stricken residents.\n\nControl room staff swamped by 999 calls\n\nControl room operators were in the \u2018invidious\u2019 position of being outnumbered by an unprecedented number of 999 calls on the night and \u2018responded with great courage and dedication in the most harrowing of circumstances\u2019, said Sir Martin.\n\nEmotional Kensington firemen join bereaved family members including the parents and sister of Jessica Urbano, at the tribute wall near to Grenfell Tower in West London for a minutes' silence\n\nDaily Mail front page June 15, 2017 - Grenfell Tower FireFalling burning debris at the scene of a huge fire at Grenfell tower block in White City, London\n\nControl room staff \u2018undoubtedly saved lives\u2019, but their operation was beset by \u2018shortcomings in practice, policy and training\u2019.
