Trump said that \u201cneedles\u201d and \u201cother things\u201d were pouring into the ocean, but at least once San Francisco official has already called that claim \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at San Francisco and we\u2019re looking at Los Angeles, and we\u2019re looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there\u2019s tremendous pollution being put into the ocean because they\u2019re going through what\u2019s called the storm sewer that\u2019s for rainwater,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cAnd we have tremendous things that we don\u2019t have to discuss pouring into the ocean. You know there are needles, there are other things.\u201d\n\nTrump has been visiting the west coast this week to raise money for his reelection campaign and made the new comments on his flight from California to Washington, D.C. around midnight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation \u2014 that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco, they\u2019re in total violation, we\u2019re going to be giving them a notice very soon,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nWhen a reporter asked what kind of notice would be issued to the city, Trump wouldn\u2019t say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see over the next, I would say, less than a week. EPA is going to be putting out a notice. They\u2019re in serious violation,\u201d Trump said without elaborating what the \u201cserious violation\u201d might be.\n\n\u201cAnd this is environmental\u2026 and they have to clean it up. We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell. These are great cities. And we can\u2019t lose our great cities like this.\u201d\n\nAs local CBS news affiliate KPIX in San Francisco points out, very few of the storm drains in the city actually go directly to the ocean. The grates that appear around the city are \u201ccatch basins\u201d that send water to a treatment facility, not to the Pacific Ocean. There are a handful of exceptions where water goes to the ocean with minimal treatment but those are on the \u201coutskirts of the city\u201d in places like Ocean Beach and Mission Bay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no EPA violations,\u201d San Francisco city supervisor Matt Haney told KPIX. \u201cThis is somebody who doesn\u2019t even believe in environmental protection, and so this just sounds like nonsense.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco, like most cities in the U.S., has a tremendous problem with the number of people who are currently experiencing homelessness. There are an estimated 8,000 people living without a permanent home in San Francisco alone, according to the latest estimates.\n\nLos Angeles County has as many as 60,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night, roughly 9 per cent of which are children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the President of the United States is coming to San Francisco choosing to attack our city with lies rather than actually trying to assist us with more funding for affordable housing,\u201d Haney continued.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Trump has singled out San Francisco as a place where he wants to take action on homelessness.\n\n\u201cYou take a look at what\u2019s going on with San Francisco, it\u2019s terrible. So we\u2019re looking at it very seriously. We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d President Trump told white nationalist TV host Tucker Carlson back in July. \u201cNow, we have to take the people and do something. We have to do something.\u201d\n\nAnd President Trump has talked even more often about homelessness over the past week, complaining that foreign property investors are suffering because they have to put up with seeing the homeless.\n\n\u201cWe have people living in our best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings, where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes,\u201d Trump complained on Air Force One three days ago.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that representatives from the Trump regime, including staff from HUD, were recently in California and are considering a plan to tear down homeless encampments and move people into temporary facilities.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson insists that \u201cno one\u2019s forcing homeless people into federal facilities,\u201d but we know that the Trump regime is almost always lying. Trump\u2019s former head of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, as just one example, told Congress there was no family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border. That, of course, was a blatant lie.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what legal authority the U.S. government would have to forcibly move people to homeless concentration camps, but no one has stopped the Trump regime from doing whatever they want up to this point. It\u2019s not like anyone is going to stop them now. Maybe House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will write a strongly worded tweet. That\u2019ll show him.", "description": "Donald Trump claims the homeless population in San Francisco is polluting the ocean and says the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will issue some kind of notice to the city within a week, according to reporters travelling with the president on Air Force One last night.
