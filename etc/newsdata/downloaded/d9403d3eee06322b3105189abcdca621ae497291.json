Are there a significant number of short-term holiday lets leading to additional wear and tear?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could tick a few boxes online and be given a benchmark rating on whether the levies were likely to be high, low or pretty much on the money?\n\nCan levies be too low? Yes, indeed. Excessively low levies can be an indication that the building is badly managed, with the owners avoiding maintenance \u2013 either directly or through the capital works (sinking) fund \u2013 presumably in the hope that they can leave the cost of maintenance and repairs to the next bunch of owners.\n\nWho can help?\n\nBack to the strata data. If only there was a group or body that had all that information for all the apartment blocks in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen some geeks could punch the info into a program that would generate a table that you and I could consult when we were looking at our levies, or maybe the levies on a prospective purchase, to see if they were in the right ballpark.\n\nYou would go to the website, type in the number of units, the facilities, the age of the building and all the other relevant factors and find out immediately if a block was overspending or undercharging.\n\nBut where could you possibly find all this invaluable but disparate information? Actually, the nation\u2019s strata managers already have all that data on their computer systems.\n\nAnd Strata Community Australia, the strata managers\u2019 professional body, is the organisation best placed to pull them all together.\n\nOkay, there would be a cost. So maybe it needs a government incentive to do some serious data mining.\n\nMeanwhile, all we can do is scour the internet for buildings of a similar size, age and with comparable facilities, and hope their levies aren\u2019t as far out of kilter as ours.\n\nJimmy Thomson edits the strata living advice website flat-chat.com.au and produces a weekly podcast called the Flat Chat Wrap.
