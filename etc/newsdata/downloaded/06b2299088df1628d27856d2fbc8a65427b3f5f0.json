My kid went to the door to try to get out and smoke rushed up the steps so the only way out was through the window. Once they got the ladders up it was only a matter of getting everyone out.\u201d\n\nCBS reported that 10 people were displaced, with two taken to Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and another to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Monday night, Agholor tweeted the interview clip and asked for help in connecting with Law.\n\n\u201cThank you for being a hero in the community, would like to invite you and your family to the next home game,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAgholor caught eight of the 12 passes he was targeted on for 50 yards and two touchdowns Sunday, but he has had a rough start in 2019 with a costly error in a second straight game. Last week, he dropped a sure touchdown late in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons. He lost another Wentz pass Sunday and fumbled late in the second quarter of the loss that dropped Philadelphia to 1-2.\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nAntonio Brown says he\u2019s done with the NFL, blasts Robert Kraft and Ben Roethlisberger cases\n\nPatriots quickly moved on from Antonio Brown, but Julian Edelman\u2019s injury is an issue\n\nHow the deal between Antonio Brown and the Patriots dissolved\n\nAnalysis: Daniel Jones\u2019s debut changes everything for the Giants\n\nPerspective: The Saints prove they are more than just Drew Brees in a win over the Seahawks\n\nRams overcome a slow start and late interception, hang on for a win over Browns\n\nThe Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout\n\nHow Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting case changed animal welfare\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive", "description": "Wide receiver Nelson Agholor\u2019s struggles weren\u2019t far from the minds of Philadelphians, it seems.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OK4IBYG5Q4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
