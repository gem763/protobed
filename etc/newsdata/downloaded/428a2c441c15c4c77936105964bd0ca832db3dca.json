Those individuals need to reach out,\" Iacono said as he opened up about his recovery, appearing at times choked with emotion.\n\nAttorney Jeff Anderson said the payouts varied from five figures for some victims to more than $1 million. In each case the cash failed to bring closure, he added, although the abusers were removed from their positions.\n\n\"Payment of money in a case does not bring healing, it does not make their pain go away,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"But standing up for yourself and giving voice to your truth as a survivor, and knowing you have done something to protect other kids, is helpful.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church has been rocked by thousands of reports of sexual abuse by priests and accusations of cover-ups by senior clergy, starting in the Boston archdiocese in the United States in 2002.\n\nThe Vatican admitted in 2012 the number of abused American minors was probably close to 100 000.\n\nIacono, who settled his case against the Chicago Archdiocese 15 years ago, came forward after reading about the Boston scandal.\n\n\"I feel as though I got a lot of my power back because the Church admitted that this happened,\" he said.\n\n\"They knew that my abuser was actively abusing children of my age, and I was about 11 years old at that time and Jeff helped me through the entire process.\"", "description": "A victim of clergy abuse has urged other survivors to come forward as lawyers revealed that the Catholic Church in Chicago had paid out more than $80 million in sexual assault cases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4853/9ea619a498204b789d8f01ead92e6161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
