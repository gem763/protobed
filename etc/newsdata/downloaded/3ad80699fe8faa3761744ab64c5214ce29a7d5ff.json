It will create half a million jobs, stimulate house building along its route and support much-needed investment across the Midlands, North and beyond.\n\n\"It is the critical spine that will bring wider transport improvements like Northern Powerhouse Rail and the Midlands Rail Hub to life.\"\n\nNorthern leaders have also published a review recommending that the North and Midlands must take control of plans for a high-speed rail network in their areas.\n\n'Damaging delays'\n\nThe Northern Powerhouse Independent Review called for the establishment of a body named HS2 North, which would be at arm's-length from the government and be overseen by Transport for the North to ensure HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail are combined efficiently.\n\nChris Oglesby, chief executive of Manchester-based property firm Bruntwood and a member of the panel which oversaw the review, said: \"Our review panel proposes that the North and Midlands must take control of the nation's high-speed network.\n\n\"HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - a major priority of Boris Johnson and his government - are completely interlinked and a joined up approach is required to both and the upgrades to existing lines.\n\n\"Only by delivering an integrated high-speed network right across the North can a Northern Powerhouse vision be truly realised. Further delays and uncertainty are hugely damaging to the North and the country as a whole.\"\n\nOver budget\n\nA review into whether to scrap HS2 was launched by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in August and is due to be completed shortly.\n\nIt is being led by Douglas Oakervee, a former chairman of HS2 Ltd - the taxpayer-funded firm building the railway - with Lord Berkeley acting as his deputy.\n\nRecent figures compiled by HS2 Ltd show the railway could be delayed by up to seven years and run \u00a326bn over budget, reaching a cost of \u00a388bn.\n\nPhase 1 of HS2 is planned to run between London and Birmingham. Current designs involve a second Y-shaped phase launching in two stages: Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe followed by phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and Birmingham to Leeds.", "description": "The call by regional heads of the CBI business lobby comes amid worries HS2 could be scaled back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1459F/production/_109195338_mediaitem109194857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
