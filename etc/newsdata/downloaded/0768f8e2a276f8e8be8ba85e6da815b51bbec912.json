Mandatory Credit: Adam Hagy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWorld number 17 Casey showcased his powerful driving and precise iron play on the third longest course on the European Tour to card a six-under-par 66, including five birdies on the last eight holes.\n\nAustrian Matthias Schwab was Casey\u2019s closest challenger with an opening 67, one shot ahead of Scotland\u2019s Robert MacIntyre, Englishman Ben Stow and home favourite Max Rottluff.\n\nCasey, who last won on the European Tour at the KLM Open in 2014, was pleased with his performance at Green Eagle Golf Course in Hamburg.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good round of golf,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah sure, there were a few putts that slid by but that is such a difficult golf course. I can\u2019t explain how difficult that golf course is.\n\n\u201cI was happy with the patience I was showing and the quality of the ball-striking, and here I stand even happier because the score doesn\u2019t do it justice as that is one of the finest rounds I\u2019ve played this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be under par, never mind six.\u201d\n\nCasey revealed he has been struggling with a sore throat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not great, but it is what it is. Maybe beware of the sick golfer,\u201d the 42-year-old added.\n\nWorld number nine Xander Schauffele finished on one over, with fellow Americans Matt Kuchar and 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed one shot further back.", "description": "England's Paul Casey overcame chilly conditions and a sore throat to grab a one-shot lead on day one of the European Open in Germany on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426642578&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF841WK", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
