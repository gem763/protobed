Last year, he told the Tallahassee Democrat: \u201cTwenty-plus subpoenas have been issued and not one of them has anything to do with me.\u201d\n\nBut the recent one does. Previously, the investigation had centered on corruption inside Tallahassee government, including during Gillum\u2019s time as mayor. The newer subpoena is more focused on Gillum\u2019s 2018 campaign and people and organizations with clear ties to him, but with less obvious connections to Tallahassee City Hall.\n\nGillum, now a CNN contributor, declined to answer specific questions about the subpoena or say whether a subpoena was issued to him. In a statement to the Times, Gillum said: \"We stand ready to assist any future review of our work, because I am confident we always did the right thing and complied fully with the law.\u201d\n\nMORE ON ANDREW GILLUM: Andrew Gillum agrees to $5,000 ethics fine.\n\nRecords show FBI agents gave Andrew Gillum tickets to \u2018Hamilton\u2019\n\nAndrew Gillum\u2019s ethics case continues after Florida commission finds cause\n\n\u201cWe ran an open and honest campaign. A campaign powered by thousands of volunteers and supporters. A campaign that captured imaginations and earned over four million votes,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cWhen you run a campaign that puts the power in the hands of the people, and fights for change, it inevitably invites close scrutiny, regardless of the facts.\u201d\n\nAs a policy, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office does not confirm or deny the existence of a matter before a grand jury, or whether a subpoena has been issued, the agency\u2019s press office said.\n\nIf someone is named in a subpoena, it does not mean an individual or entity is under investigation. Rather, subpoenas are a tool for prosecutors to gather information that they could later present as evidence to a grand jury.\n\nIssued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee, the subpoena demands \u201cdocuments, electronically stored information, or objects\u201d dating back to January 2015 about Gillum, his 2018 gubernatorial campaign and his political committee, Forward Florida. It requests documents be turned over at either a Tallahassee courthouse or to the FBI by May 7.\n\nThe subpoena also demands information on:\n\nJohn H. Jackson, the president and CEO of the Schott Foundation for Public Education, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit. Gillum was listed as a board member on the nonprofit\u2019s website until March 2017. Also on the subpoena is a related organization: Opportunity to Learn Action Fund. Gillum was president of that nonprofit as recently as 2017, according to its tax documents.\n\nDonald Sussman, an investor and philanthropist who donated $1.5 million to Gillum\u2019s bid for governor. Harris Parnell, a donor adviser who has worked for Sussman , also is named.\n\nSharon Lettman-Hicks, a long-time friend and adviser to Gillum who is currently the CEO of the National Black Justice Commission, a black LGBTQ advocacy group. She served with Gillum on the board of the Schott Foundation. Her public relations firm, P&P Communications, is also listed in the subpoena.\n\nLittle has been reported about Gillum\u2019s work for the Schott Foundation for Public Education. It is a well-regarded charity that focuses on racial and economic justice through education equality, especially in the Northeast. It has about $10 million in assets and it has distributed millions of dollars in grants to education organizations around the country.\n\nGillum, who campaigned on a platform of raising teacher pay and investing $1 billion in public schools, didn\u2019t draw attention to the years he served on the board of an education charity. He declined to say what years he served but he is listed on the Schott Foundation\u2019s tax records as a board member from as early as 2013 to 2017.\n\nJackson, its president, is the former national director of education and chief policy officer for the NAACP and has served as the Schott Foundation\u2019s leader since 2007. Jackson posted a glowing congratulatory letter about Gillum on the foundation\u2019s website after the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Andrew Gillum for close to two decades, as a friend, staunch advocate for an opportunity to learn for all students and ultimately as a colleague as a member of the Schott Foundation Board of Directors,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cAll of us at Schott are proud of what our colleague and friend has accomplished, and can\u2019t wait to see what Andrew Gillum, Florida voters and the growing movement for public education in Florida achieve next.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the subpoena, Jackson declined to comment through his lawyer, Ron Meyer of Tallahassee.\n\nOpportunity to Learn Action Fund is a separate, much smaller entity controlled by the Schott Foundation. Gillum was the president from as early as 2014 until at least 2017, according to publicly available tax documents, when the organization reported expenses ranging from $50,000 to $125,000. Gillum did not take a salary.\n\nUnlike the Schott Foundation and other traditional charities, Opportunity to Learn is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, meaning up to 50 percent of its expenses can go toward political purposes. Its mission, according to tax documents, is \u201cpromoting improvement in America\u2019s public education systems and advocating for educational policy reforms.\u201d\n\nFlorida Gubernatorial Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum gives a campaign speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, on Thursday, October 25, 2018. [OCTAVIO JONES | Times ]\n\nLettman-Hicks, who is a close friend and mentor to Gillum since his days at Florida A&M University, remains listed as a board member for the Schott Foundation on the organization\u2019s website.\n\nIn a brief phone conversation Tuesday, Lettman-Hicks acknowledged she served on Schott Foundation\u2019s board but said about the subpoena: \u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to discuss that.\u201d She declined to say whether she spoke with authorities or was asked to turn over documents.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me some deep information,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to send it to me, I can have a point of reference of what you\u2019re talking about. But I can\u2019t be of further assistance sight unseen.\u201d She then hung up.\n\nGillum\u2019s relationship with Lettman-Hicks was a point of controversy during last year\u2019s governor race. Gillum reported income in 2017 of $71,000 from Lettman-Hicks\u2019 firm on a state financial disclosure report. Meanwhile, his campaign rented space from her Tallahassee public relations firm, P&P Communications, at a cost of nearly $45,000.\n\nMORE TIMES POLITICAL COVERAGE: How felons can register to vote in Florida under new Amendment 4 bill\n\nFlorida officials wanted an elections cybersecurity team. Lawmakers said no.\n\nTrump needs Florida in 2020. He obviously knows that.\n\nGillum has repeatedly dodged questions about his work for Lettman-Hicks, which started soon after he left his job at the People For the American Way. In one interview with the HuffPost, he declined to name his clients. Lettman-Hicks later told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter that she was Gillum\u2019s only client.\n\nIt is unclear what connection, if any, exists between these nonprofits and Donald Sussman. The Connecticut financier donated $1 million to Forward Florida two days after Gillum became the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for governor, and he followed it up with another $500,000 check in October. Sussman was previously a large contributor to Democratic causes in Maine and donated $21 million to a super PAC supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.\n\nSussman did not respond to a message left for him at his investment firm, Paloma Partners. Attempts to reach Harris Parnell were unsuccessful.\n\nFBI investigators first arrived in Tallahassee in August 2015. The undercover operation has led to the arrest of three individuals: suspended City Commissioner Scott Maddox, his former chief of staff Paige Carter-Smith and businessman J.T. Burnette. A superseding indictment of the three made public earlier this month lists 47 charges, and it alleges Burnette was the middleman in a shakedown and bribery scheme that netted Maddox and Carter-Smith hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nUndercover FBI agents were the ones who gave Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum a ticket to the Broadway show Hamilton during a trip to New York City in 2016, according to a trove of records given to the ethics commission and released to the public in 2018. Text messages between Gillum and former lobbyist Adam Corey, who arranged outings with undercover agents looking into city corruption, were among more than 100 pages of records Corey gave the ethics commission, which is investigating trips to Costa Rica and New York that Gillum took in 2016.\n\nDuring that investigation, FBI agents posing as developers met Gillum and a friend, lobbyist Adam Corey, in New York City, where they took a now-infamous boat ride around New York Harbor and attended the hit Broadway show Hamilton. A trove of records released two weeks before the election allegedly showed that FBI agents paid for Gillum\u2019s hotel room and his ticket to the musical.\n\nThere does not seem to be much connection between the players in that probe and this recent subpoena \u2014 except for Gillum. The previously reported investigation focused on city business and contracts with developers; the newer subpoena centers on people and entities in Gillum\u2019s political and professional orbit.\n\nGrand juries do not determine guilt or innocence, only whether there's probable cause to believe someone committed a crime. Federal grand jury proceedings are typically secret and closely guarded, but witnesses can disclose they have been summoned, unless explicitly prohibited. Many choose not to.\n\nIt is unclear whether the federal grand jury is the same that has reviewed evidence and indicted the three individuals in the Tallahassee corruption probe.\n\nGillum has not been charged with any crime. In January, the Florida Commission on Ethics unanimously found probable cause that Gillum, while Tallahassee mayor, violated state ethics laws by accepting gifts from Corey and the undercover FBI agents. Gillum reached a settlement agreement with a commission lawyer in April to pay a $5,000 fine in exchange for dropping four of the five ethics violation charges.\n\nRELATED: Andrew Gillum\u2019s ethics fine: Is $5,000 a lot or not?\n\nAndrew Gillum launches 2020 voter registration drive\n\nOne on one with Andrew Gillum\n\nGillum has sought to move on from the cloud of the investigation and get on with his political career. Through his political committee Forward Florida, he is leading an effort to recruit 1 million more Democrats to vote in the 2020 election.\n\nIn an interview with the Times on May 16, Gillum said of the FBI investigation: \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for any shoes to drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do hope that whatever the FBI is up to that they bring it to a speedy conclusion,\u201d Gillum said then. \u201cI think that would be in the best interest of my city, but also for the individuals involved.\u201d\n\nTimes senior news researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.
