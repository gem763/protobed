Hunter, of course, at the center of so many questions about that white house pressure campaign on Ukraine. Amy is back with more and no questions were off limits in this one. That is correct. Good morning, Cecilia. President trump has been on a rampage accusing hunter Biden of improperly profiting on business interests in Ukraine while his father was vice president and the point person on Ukraine leading to that infamous phone call in July when president trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. I want to get to the heart of it. Did you and your father ever discuss Ukraine? No. As I said, the only time was after a news account -- it wasn't a discussion in any way. There is no but to this. No, we never did. Your dad said I hope you know what you're doing and you said I do. And I said, I do and that was literally the end of our discussion. Why? Because my dad was vice president of the United States. There's literally nothing as a young man or as a full grown adult that my father in some way hasn't had influence over. It doesn't serve either one of us. When he said I hope you know what you're doing what did he think you were doing. He read the press reports I joined the board of burisma and there's been a lot of misinformation about me, not about my dad, nobody buys that. But buys this idea I was uncomfortabled to be on the board. Do you regret being on the board to begin with? No, I don't regret being on the board. What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea which has, again, been completely debunked by everyone and -- I think people are thinking how could that have not crossed your mind like you felt maybe this isn't a good idea to go and sit on the board of this Ukrainian company. I just said to you in retrospect I wish -- At the time you never thought, this might not look You know what, I'm a human. You know what, did I make a mistake, well, maybe in the grand scheme of thing, yeah, but did I make a mistake based upon some unethical lapse, absolutely not. And you can see more of our exclusive interview with hunter tonight on \"World news\" and on \"Nightline\" as well.
