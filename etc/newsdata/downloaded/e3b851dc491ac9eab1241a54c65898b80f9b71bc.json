Would have been tough had he ended up with no points\n\nLIVERPOOL (4-3-3)\n\nAlisson Becker - 6\n\nFirst start since the opening weekend but wasn't overly tested; no chance with United's goal\n\nAlisson Becker made his Premier League return but didn't get to keep a clean-sheet\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 6\n\nUse of the ball wasn't as good as normal; went close at the end with a dipping volley\n\nJoel Matip - 7\n\nMade a good start and won several headers but had a mid-game dip before finishing strong\n\nVirgil van Dijk - 7\n\nIt's a long time since a striker has made him work like Rashford did; came through the test powerfully\n\nVirgil van Dijk was put under pressure against United but handled it with his usual poise\n\nAndrew Robertson - 7.5\n\nLiverpool's most consistent performer through the 90 minutes and provided the assist for the equaliser\n\nJordan Henderson - 6\n\nDifficult afternoon for the captain and a new position wide on the right didn't really suit him\n\nFabinho - 6.5\n\nBooked for one late tackle; way off the pace in the first half but never went into hiding\n\nGini Wijnaldum - 5.5\n\nEarly shot made De Gea work but had one of those games when the bulk of the action passed him by\n\nJordan Henderson had a disjointed game as Liverpool's passing faltered at Old Trafford\n\nSadio Mane - 6\n\nWill feel aggrieved to have a goal chalked off by VAR but it was right decision; didn't get too many chances\n\nRoberto Firmino - 6.5\n\nErratic start, typified a wild shot, but he came through it and his running made United's defenders anxious\n\nDivock Origi - 5.5\n\nShould have won a free-kick immediately before United scored but didn't see enough of the ball\n\nSadio Mane was less influential as Liverpool faltered, the winger's goal ruled-out for handball\n\nSubs: Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Origi) 7 Lallana (for Henderson) 7\n\nJurgen Klopp - 7\n\nDisappointed with the way his team played in the opening 45 minutes but kept making changes to ensure they got back into the game; each substitution paid dividends\n\nReferee Martin Atkinson - 5.5\n\nHe got the big call wrong when failing to spot Origi had been fouled by Lindelof when in an excellent position.
