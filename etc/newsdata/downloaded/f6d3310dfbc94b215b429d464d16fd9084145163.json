He called on German leaders and the entire free world to bring the full force of law against antisemitism and its results.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to campaign for education and remembrance in the fight against anti-Semitism which raises its head again and again in Europe and across the world, based on the clear understanding that it is not a problem of the Jews alone, but threatens to destroy us all,\u201d the president said.\n\nTwo Killed, One Arrested in Shooting at German Synagogue https://t.co/J43iSRLEqV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 9, 2019\n\nAt least two people were shot dead in the eastern German city of Halle on Wednesday, with a synagogue among the targets. The suspect, identified by German media as 27-year-old German Stephan Balliet, filmed the assault and posted the video online.\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said, in a chilling reminder of the mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand last March which was also online in real-time.\n\nThe US Embassy in Berlin tweeted its condemnation of the attack as well. \u201cThis attack is an attack on all of us and the perpetrators must be held accountable. We mourn the victims of this senseless violence,\u201d the tweet read.\n\nThe embassy announced that 10 Americans were in the synagogue at the time of the attack.\n\nDr. Moshe Kantor, President of the European Jewish Congress has commented that, \u2018\u201cWe are relieved that an even greater tragedy was avoided because of the security around the synagogue which apparently took measures to ensure that the attacker was not able to enter into the premises. However, that Jews observing one of the holiest days of the year were targeted for death should send shock waves in Germany and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe need to do more to guarantee these types of attacks do not happen again, by combatting radicalisation, creating tougher law enforcement measures and putting more resources into educating towards tolerance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Central Council of Jews in Germany condemned German authorities for \u201cnegligence\u201d after it released a man who attempted to run into a synagogue armed with a knife in central Berlin on Friday evening.\n\nAFP contributed to this report", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his shock and anger at Wednesday's synagogue attack in Germany.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/05/benjain-netanyau.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
