That took them about a year and a half, with Tezza designing the look of the app and all of the filters using software like Adobe Lightroom, they said.\n\n\"We were as scrappy as it gets,\" Tezza said. \"Living in a shoe box, working on a million different business ideas at once. We could have hired someone, but we were determined to do it on our own.\"\n\nToday, the app has 2 million downloads and 4.9 out of 5 stars on the iTunes App Store (out of 5,000 ratings). The app just launched video editing and Instagram Story templates.\n\nInfluencers like the popular YouTube star Aspyn Ovard, who has 3.4 million YouTube subscribers, and the lifestyle blogger Amber Fillerup, who has 1.4 million Instagram followers, have recommended the app and spoken about how they have used it.\n\nThe Tezza App is subscription-based and users pay $1.99 a month. Tezza said they decided on a subscription model to allow them to consistently update it with new filters.\n\n\"This allows us to maintain it and keep growing the way we want to,\" Cole said. \"We knew we were going to be continually improving it and releasing new features all of the time.\"\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Tezza shared her tips on how to stand out on Instagram.\n\nRead more: How to become a successful influencer, according to YouTube and Instagram stars\n\nTessa Barton\n\n1. Choose a color aesthetic or 'look'\n\nAn aesthetic, or the look you are going for on your Instagram page, can be achieved by editing your photos in a similar way, Tezza said.\n\nThe Tezza App offers a variety of presets (preset photo-filter settings) and templates, which Tezza creates and can be selected and used instead of, or with additional editing, on the app directly. Presets bring out certain colors within a photo, and templates are used to add elements like borders.\n\n\"Having your color aesthetic, or nailing down what your photos look like as a whole, is super important,\" Tezza said. \"Because that is your entire brand, right?\"\n\nTezza App. Tessa Barton\n\nTezza said she has never once deleted a photo from her Instagram page. She said it's a good way for people to observe her creative growth and evolution as an influencer.\n\nOnce you have the aesthetic down, you need to focus on the actual content you are shooting, Tezza said.\n\n2. Get inspired and 'stop focusing on one image'\n\n\"Sometimes we will give ourselves a challenge,\" Tezza said, referring to when she and Cole start to feel uninspired.\n\nThey'll do things like force themselves to shoot multiple images in a certain place or particular room, coming up with something different.\n\n\"We will just come up with every single angle and use light in a different way,\" she said.\n\nTessa Barton\n\n\"Stop focusing on one image, and really focus on an aesthetic,\" she added. \"We try to create a series. Really create more of a story than just a single picture.\"\n\nPick one filter that can go along with everything that you are doing online, she said. That will help give you a clear voice. She said to use this filter not just on your main Instagram feed but also in your Instagram Stories and videos as well.\n\nShe advised using \"story templates,\" which she said would make your Instagram Stories stand out and have a professional look.\n\n\"I just think when you are scrolling through stories every single day, it can get pretty boring,\" she said.\n\n3. Think about why you are taking the photo and who you want to like it\n\nTake time to nail down your overall tone and what audience you want to reach through it, Tezza said.\n\nIf you're more \"moody\" and \"high fashion\" then go with that as your brand, she said. Or if you're really happy and more into lifestyle content, then show that on your page.\n\n\"I think it's good to think about why you are taking the photo and who you are wanting to like them,\" she said. \"Because sometimes I'm like, 'Why isn't this brand hiring me?' But then I take a step out and realize that my aesthetic does not fit that.\"\n\nFor more on how to become a successful influencer, according to YouTube and Instagram stars, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:\n\nYouTube star Shelby Church breaks down how much money a video with 1 million views makes her\n\nHow Instagram influencers land their first brand-sponsorship deals\n\nBeauty mogul Huda Kattan, who built a $610 million fortune from online fame, shares 3 business tips for influencers starting their careers", "description": "Tezza created the app as a way to share her photo-editing tips and the photo filters she uses with her followers.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d769bba2e22af234e041b64-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
