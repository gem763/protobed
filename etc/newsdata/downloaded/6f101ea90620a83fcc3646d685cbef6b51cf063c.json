Four others were also killed.\n\nAround 5,000 supporters took part in a walk through the city to the stadium before the match, while a minute's silence was held before kick off.\n\nHowever, Burnley took the lead after 26 minutes when Dwight McNeil's cross was headed by Wood toward the top corner. Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel got a hand to it but could not keep it out.\n\nLeicester's reply came in the final minute of the first half as Vardy met a cross into the penalty area to head home the equaliser.\n\nOn the hour mark, the King Power Stadium rose as one to once again to remember Vichai, who was 60 when he died.\n\nThe Leicester fans held aloft the free commemorative scarves which were left on every seat inside the stadium and sang their late chairman's name.\n\nBack on the pitch, Tielemans struck the decisive blow after substitute Demarai Gray exchanged passes with Ricardo Pereira before whipping the ball into the near post area.\n\nHarvey Barnes attempted to flick it on with but it eventually found its way to Tielemans, who took one touch before emphatically finishing with a shot off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nWood later thought he had equalized but his goal was ruled out by VAR for a trip on Jonny Evans.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
