They also happen to share the misfortune of having sat at some point on the market unsold for years.\n\n\n\nThey are just a few of the many examples that show that, when it comes to smart real estate investment, biggest is rarely best. Those who build or buy homes exponentially larger than their neighbors often face an equally large job when it comes time to sell, including prolonged listing times, numerous discounts and the potential for a negative return on investment. That\u2019s because such disproportionate homes have a limited appeal even among buyers with infinite resources, who often consider qualities beyond sheer size.\n\n\n\nMore: Ultra-Modern London Mansion With Pool and Tennis Court Asks \u00a340 Million\n\nReturns Diminish\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are diminishing returns on size,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, a New York-based real estate appraiser. \u201cJust by adding square footage doesn\u2019t mean that it contributes proportionally to value.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Miller offered the example of a 30,000-square-foot mansion built in an area where the typical home is more like 10,000 square feet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the value is going to be triple its neighbors. It would likely be worth more, but not proportionally,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA recent example of the diminishing returns on size is The Manor, a Los Angeles estate built in the early 1990s by TV producer Aaron Spelling, and at 56,500 square feet\u2014roughly the size of a football field\u2014it\u2019s one of the, if not the, largest completed house in the city.\n\n\n\nThe Manor set a record for Los Angeles County in July when it traded hands for nearly $120 million, Mansion Global reported at the time. And while it was the highest overall price, the value of each square foot, at $1,120, was fairly low for an L.A. trophy home. For instance, the Playboy Mansion just down the street sold for a whopping $5,000 per square foot when it traded hands for $100 million in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe Manor in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles Getty Images\n\n\u201cLarger houses can have a lower price per foot when you get past a certain size,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\n\n\nEven the two-bedroom 1930s house across the street sold nine years ago for 30% more than the Manor on a square-foot basis, property records show.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou never want to be the most expensive house in any community, whether that be the tract, subdivision or city neighborhood\u2014that\u2019s theoretically,\u201d said Jeffrey Hyland, president at Hilton & Hyland and one of the brokers on the Manor and Playboy Mansion. \u201cThe reality is there\u2019s always a buyer for the best property, especially in L.A. where you are in some ways expected to show off your success.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut when it comes to the most elite trophy homes, details\u2014including the view, architect and provenance of a house\u2014can create far more value than simply size, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of developers believe that the more square footage, the more you would get and that\u2019s absolutely not true,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the smaller house next door has a better view, it probably commands a higher price.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore: Los Angeles Prices Hit New High Amid Sliding Transactions\n\nSquare footage played barely a supporting role in the sale of Malibu\u2019s record breaker, a teak-clad beach house hotelier Peter Morton sold last year for $110 million. The relatively modest-sized home on billionaire-favored Carbon Beach spans less than 7,000 square feet, but shattered the area\u2019s price record due to its location on 100 feet of prime beach and its star architectural pedigree, said Mr. Hyland, also a broker on the sale.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was all about architecture, it was all about location,\u201d he said, adding that other sometimes overlooked factors include a property\u2019s acreage, privacy and security.\n\n\n\nReselling Requires Patience, Often Price Cuts\n\n\n\nFor those who venture ahead with building or buying the biggest house in town, be warned it will likely take a long time to sell and go through multiple price cuts, history shows.\n\n\n\nNBA legend Shaquille O\u2019Neal is well acquainted with the challenge of selling the biggest house for miles. His palatial Mediteranean-style home outside Orlando, Florida, is so big it\u2019s hosted whole professional basketball teams to practice in its 6,000-square-foot regulation-size basketball court. Shaq\u2019s taken the home on and off the market since since May 2018 and slashed one-fifth off its original $28 million asking price, Mansion Global previously reported.\n\n\n\nDustin Fealy, a listing agent with The Agency Collective in Florida, told Mansion Global when it last relisted in June that Mr. O\u2019Neal managed somehow to make it homey despite its massive size. \u201cA lot of megamansions over 30,000 square feet have the feeling of an office building,\u201d he said at the time.\n\n\n\nMore: With a $40 Million Price Cut, Spelling Manor Still Among L.A.\u2019s Most Expensive Homes\n\nThat\u2019s all to say nothing of the massive upkeep that goes into maintaining a palatial house, which could put off any buyer.\n\n\n\nTake the largest privately owned home in England, Wentworth Woodhouse, an 18th-century manor that boasts five miles of corridors and so many rooms no one knows exactly how many there are. Even with its historic cache\u2014it\u2019s said to be the inspiration for Pemberley Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d\u2014the estate ultimately sold after three years on the market to preservationists for \u00a37 million, Mansion Global reported at the time.\n\n\n\nThe Wentworth Woodhouse estate in South Yorkshire Wikipedia\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be palatial for size to present an issue when it comes time to sell, as Alexandra Sierra of Compass Florida knows well. She\u2019s marketing a custom-built hurricane-proofed home on the border of Miami suburbs Coral Gables and Coconut Grove, and at nearly 5,500 square feet has struggled to sell because it\u2019s larger and more modernized than anything in the neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe square footage is killing me,\u201d she said of the five-bedroom house asking $2.5 million.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: The Lamborghini 2020 Huracan Evo Spyder Packs A Lot of Punch in a Little Package\n\nPalatial home owners and developers may also face trouble selling in the future as younger millionaires have shown a greater preference for smaller but better built and better amenitized homes, Ms. Sierra said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMillennials who buy houses between $2 million and $4 million want functionality. It\u2019s very rare that you see them buying mansions where you have to take care of huge lawns and enormous houses,\u201d Ms. Sierra said. \u201cThey want simple, they want smaller square footage and they\u2019re thinking about how the floor plan flows.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to make these megamansions obsolete.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120511?size=1.641025641025641&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
