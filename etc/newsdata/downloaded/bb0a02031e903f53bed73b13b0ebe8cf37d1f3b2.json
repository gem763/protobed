(AP) - Beginning next year, Ford\u2019s redesigned vehicle models will allow software updates over the internet or through cellular phone connections.\n\nThe company says every model will be equipped with the technology as they are redesigned. The shift will reduce visits to dealers for service and even some computer-related recall repairs.\n\nOnce completed, Ford will join electric car maker Tesla Inc. in having over-the-air software updates across its model lineup.\n\nOwners will be able to opt in to the program and get updates over their home wireless network at no cost. The cost for cellular updates has not been announced.\n\nFord Motor Co. said Wednesday that it will be able to update nearly all vehicle computer systems once the system is active.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Beginning next year, Ford's redesigned vehicle models will allow software updates over the internet or through cellular phone connections.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/ford_software_updates_20358_c0-220-5259-3287_s1200x700.jpg?6a2d42b3dda2530405cefb1c288e080a848159a6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
