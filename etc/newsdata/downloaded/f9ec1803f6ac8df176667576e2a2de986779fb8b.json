She points out macro indicators such as ISM U.S. manufacturing PMI haven't bottomed yet.\n\n\"Small caps are still in an earnings recession right now,\" said Hall.\n\nShe questions whether Wall Street is warming up to the battered stocks too quickly.\n\n\"Expectations for next year look quite aggressive,\" said Hall. \"Analysts are still forecasting that small caps go from seeing flattish earnings growth this year to somewhere between 15 and 20% earnings growth next year, and the guidance has still been pretty weak.\"\n\nThe Russell 2000 , which consists of small caps, just completed its best week since Dec. 9, 2016. The index has jumped almost 5% over the past five sessions and is now up 17% so far this year. However, it's still off more than 9% from its all-time high hit in the summer of 2018.\n\nYet, Hall reiterates a bullish tide should lift the stocks.\n\n\"The relative multiple of the Russell 2000 versus the Russell 1000 is now at its lowest levels in 17 years,\" Hall said. \"While valuations aren't usually that predictive of a measure over the short-term, they do tend to matter a lot if you're a long-term investor.\"\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Jill Carey Hall sees small caps outperforming large caps over the next decade.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102965690-GettyImages-486174944.jpg?v=1568317836", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
