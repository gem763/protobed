The deal is reportedly for three years and valued in the \u201cmid-eight-figure range,\u201d Deadline is reporting, indicating tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThe announcement comes just after an incredibly successful Emmys weekend for Waller-Bridge. Fleabag won three of the night\u2019s most coveted awards in the comedy categories, including Best Comedy, Best Actress in a Comedy Series, and Best Writing for a Comedy Series. Waller-Bridge\u2019s other series, Killing Eve, which airs on BBC America, also picked up a few awards. The overall deal between Amazon and Waller-Bridge was in \u201cits final stages by this past weekend,\u201d according to Deadline.\n\nWaller-Bridge is one of the most sought-after creators right now, and Amazon\u2019s exclusivity deal is just another example of the growing arms race for high-profile writers and creators as the streaming wars heat up. Netflix reportedly paid Ryan Murphy (American Horror Story) $300 million, Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) $150 million, and Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss $250 million for exclusive overall contracts.\n\nThat race isn\u2019t limited to Netflix and Amazon. WarnerMedia reportedly paid $250 million for a first-look overall deal with J.J. Abrams and his company Bad Robot, ahead of its pending HBO Max launch. Abrams also reportedly walked away from a $500 million totally exclusive deal with Apple for its new streaming service, Apple TV Plus, and signed with WarnerMedia because his contract gives him the ability to work with other networks and studios.\n\nThe next year will be dominated by companies trying to get people to sign up for their streaming services. WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max, NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock, Apple\u2019s TV Plus, Disney\u2019s Disney+, and even short-form video platform Quibi are all launching services, and are eager to lock down exclusive content that can garner both attention and awards.\n\nFor Amazon, betting on Fleabag early \u2014 and giving Waller-Bridge the creative freedom to realize it \u2014 seems to have paid off. Reached for comment by Variety, the Fleabag creator said that working on the show was a \u201ccreative partnership dreams are made of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really feels like home,\u201d Waller-Bridge said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get going!\u201d", "description": "Fleabag creator, writer, and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge has signed an exclusive overall deal with Amazon Prime Video, one that is reportedly for three years and valued in the \"mid-eight-figure range,\" Deadline reports, indicating tens of millions of dollars.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TYDnjrBi6PLTIg0IOdRnZbZ9Wg=/0x30:3000x1601/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19228649/1176511461.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
