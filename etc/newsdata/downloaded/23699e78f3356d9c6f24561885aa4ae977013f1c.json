He broke down in tears while Mr Sembiring spoke for him.\n\n'Before he feels like he was just alone. But now... [it feels like] he had a big family,' Mr Sembiring told Sunday Night.\n\nBut despite the warm welcome, Wawa eventually confronted his Korowai family about what happened to his uncle, who was killed due to an affair with another man's wife.\n\nThe Korowai (pictured in 2006) that Wawa grew up in believe that when a person dies it is because of a bad spirit\n\n'We should talk and discuss in a nice way to get a solution. Why do you kill like that? Don't we have a solution like talking to the other people or talking to the leader of society?' he asked.\n\nHe wanted his tribe to learn a different way of life, as its members are currently 'weak' and susceptible to being taken over by another group, he said.\n\nWawa's uncles were stirred by his speech and said they wanted the young man to become the leader of the tribe - a far cry from what almost happened to him as a child.\n\nThe tribe hunt, kill and eat the people they believe are responsible their loved ones death.

Pictured: A skull found in the village\n\nHis brother, Devi, is also believed to be a sorcerer and faces a similar threat.\n\nWawa wanted to bring his younger brother home with him, but was unable to do so this time around.\n\nHe was told Devi would be safe if he obeyed the terms of his exile.\n\nWawa has high hopes for his former home.\n\nThe football player left the village in tears when he returned home - but he promised to return.", "description": "The Korowai tribe, in West Papua which Wawa\u00a0Chombonggai grew up in, believe when a person dies it is because of a bad spirit.", "authors": ["Claudia Poposki For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20242152-0-image-a-22_1572176561490.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
