I am striking for a decolonized future. A decolonized world is one in which the wealthiest nations and industries do not continue to exploit communities in the global south, and instead support them in dealing with the effects of the climate crisis , like droughts, hurricanes and floods. A decolonized world is one where those most affected by the climate crisis \u2014 poor and indigenous communities and those in the global south \u2014 are heard and have a seat at the table where decisions are made .\n\nI am fighting for a decolonized future, because a decolonized world is the only one that will be able to turn the tide on the climate crisis.\n\nMany people pin the start of the climate crisis to the Industrial Revolution, when we started digging for coal, mining fossil fuels out of the ground and burning them at a large scale. It actually started long before that.\n\nColonization started the climate crisis. With colonization, European settlers destroyed natural habitats, hunted species to death and brought in invasive plants that indigenous and African slaves were forced to grow.\n\nWith colonialism came the idea that everything on this earth is made for our extraction and that everything is to be bought and sold. We see this in the arrival of European colonizers to the Americas, where the land, water and other natural resources were stolen and abused.\n\nWith colonialism came the idea that nothing \u2014 not air, water, trees or animals \u2014 was sacred or priceless. And this historical mind-set is the core of how we got to the climate disaster. Before the first coal was mined, even before the first factories opened, the seeds for the climate crisis had been planted, and colonialism never went away, it just evolved.\n\nIf we can agree that the root of climate change is colonialism, then the solution is to decolonize our society \u2014 from the way we get our food and energy to the way we relate to each other. Let\u2019s divest from fossil fuels and phase out those toxic systems to build anew.", "description": "Thousands of students like me are protesting today.
