We can somehow see it\u2026\n\nBack in January, Jonathan spoke to Metro.co.uk about his planned name change, but explained that the process had not been an easy one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in the process of legally changing it and it\u2019s in the works with the lawyers, there\u2019s so much stuff that has to be done \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy process,\u2019 he said.\n\nReflecting on becoming his alter ego, he continued: \u2018When people call me Jonathan it\u2019s almost weird at this point because in America, it\u2019s Foodgod all the time.\n\n\u2018After somebody says it once, they can\u2019t stop saying it. It\u2019s like a thing. If you look there\u2019s Puff Daddy and you think \u2013 wait, that is your name. Foodgod\u2026 it\u2019s one word so it\u2019s easy.\u2019\n\nWhatever floats your boat, erm, Foodgod.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
