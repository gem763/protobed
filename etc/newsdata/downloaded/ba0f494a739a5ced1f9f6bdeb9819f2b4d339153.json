(NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) announces its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019 (\u201cQ3\u201d). Total production during Q3 was 35,042 gold ounces and 947,145 silver ounces, or 45,930 gold equivalent ounces(1)(\u201cGEOs\u201d) using the average gold:silver price ratio for Q3 of 87:1. Our four producing mines generated Earnings From Mining Operations of $9.4 million(2)(3) during the quarter. We continued to invest in exploration and development, spending $15.8 million on advanced projects during Q3, which contributed to our consolidated net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.03 per share.\n\n\n\nQ4 2019 and 2020 Outlook\n\nDuring Q4 2019, we expect to produce between 42,000-46,000 GEOs, placing us near the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Cash costs and AISC(1)(2) will be elevated at Gold Bar due to improvements and repairs to the conveying systems and process plant. Cash costs at Black Fox are expected to return to the levels we guided for the year, and AISC is expected to remain above guidance due to additional sustaining capital expenditures.\n\nFor 2020, we expect an overall improvement in GEOs produced and our global cost per GEO compared to 2019, as Gold Bar is forecast to produce 65,000-70,000 gold ounces during the year. Production and cost guidance for 2020 will be provided with our Q4 results.\n\nOperations Update\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 Mine, Argentina (49% Interest)\n\nThe mine is on-track to achieving our full year guidance for 2019 of 49,000 gold ounces and 3,225,000 silver ounces. Our attributable production from San Jos\u00e9 in Q3 was 13,575 gold ounces and 943,037 silver ounces, for a total of 24,415 GEOs, compared to 21,676 GEOs in 2018. Cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $915 and $1,204 per GEO, respectively, in line with our guidance for the year. During Q3 we received $2 million, and subsequent to the end of the quarter we received a further $3 million, in dividends from our interest in the San Jos\u00e9 Mine.\n\nBlack Fox Mine, Canada (100% Interest)\n\nIn Q3, Black Fox produced 7,427 gold ounces, compared to 11,618 gold ounces in 2018. Cash costs and AISC were $941 and $1,363, respectively. AISC was above our guidance primarily due to lower than expected gold production.\n\nOur 2019 exploration budget for the Black Fox Complex is $18 million. For detailed information about our ongoing exploration at the Black Fox Complex, refer to our news release dated July 10th & 25th, September 4th, 10th & 30th, and Oct. 28th.\n\nGold Bar Mine, USA (100% Interest)\n\nQ3 was the first full quarter of commercial production at Gold Bar. Production during Q3 was 11,030 gold ounces. Cash costs and AISC were above guidance at $1,088 and $1,235 per GEO, respectively, primarily due to operational challenges during the first half of the year.\n\nOur 2019 exploration budget for the Gold Bar property is $5 million. Drilling focused on Gold Bar South in order to advance permitting, with the objective of having development begin in late 2020. We also drilled two deep holes to test the potential of the property for Carlin-type gold deposits. For detailed information about our Nevada exploration program, refer to our news releases date August 20th, and October 15th.\n\nEl Gallo Mine, Mexico (100% Interest)\n\nThe mine is on-track to achieving our full year production guidance for 2019 of 16,000 gold ounces. During Q3, the mine produced 3,057 gold equivalent ounces. Cash costs and AISC were $1,153 and $1,177 per GEO, respectively. Production from residual leaching decreased due to depletion of the leachable gold content and the normal impact of the wet season. We are evaluating several methods of enhancing and extending the existing operation.\n\nWork on the Fenix Project feasibility study and permitting is progressing. During Q3 environmental permits were received for Phase 1 plant development and in-pit tailings storage.\n\nLos Azules Project, Argentina (100% Interest)\n\nDuring Q3, we continued to advance permitting efforts, preliminary engineering and cost estimating for the proposed low altitude all year access route.\n\nTable 1 below provides production and cost results for Q1, Q2 and Q3 2019 and comparative results from 2018 along with production and cost guidance for the full year 2019.\n\nTable 1: Production and Costs\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Full Year\n\n2019 Guidance 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 Total Production Gold (oz) 35,068 26,938 36,959 36,216 33,806 35,042 131,000-138,000 Silver (oz) 695,651 703,219 772,432 850,525 745,172 947,145 3,225,000 GEOs(1) 44,344 36,315 47,258 45,881 43,742 45,930 169,000-176,000 San Jos\u00e9 Mine, Argentina (49%)(4)\n\nGold (oz) 10,822 10,559 12,139 13,518 11,768 13,575 49,000 Silver (oz) 692,052 701,341 769,197 848,268 743,100 943,037 3,225,000 GEOs(1) 20,049 19,910 22,395 23,157 21,676 24,415 87,000 Cash Costs ($/GEO)(1)(2) 934 749 806 960 856 915 860 AISC ($/GEO)(1)(2) 1,148 1,115 1,065 1,207 1,028 1,204 1,120 El Gallo Mine, Mexico GEOs(1) 12,217 5,432 10,808 5,354 10,448 3,057 16,000 Cash Costs ($/GEO)(1)(2) 691 967 783 926 671 1,153 875 AISC ($/GEO)(1)(2) 753 989 816 939 683 1,177 915 Black Fox Mine, Canada GEOs(1) 12,078 8,943 14,055 9,430 11,618 7,427 36,000-40,000 Cash Costs ($/GEO)(1)(2) 849 805 771 837 932 941 905 AISC ($/GEO)(1)(2) 1,188 1,454 1,056 1,196 1,285 1,363 1,080 Gold Bar Mine, Nevada GEOs(1) - 2,030(5) - 7,940(5) - 11,030 30,000-33,000 Cash Costs ($/GEO)(1)(2) - - - 901 - 1,088 930 AISC ($/GEO)(1)(2) - - - 1,088 - 1,235 975\n\nNotes:\n\n'Gold Equivalent Ounces' are calculated based on a 75:1 gold to silver price ratio for periods up to and including Q1 2019, 88:1 for Q2 2019, and 87:1 for Q3. 2019 GEO and costs guidance is stated using a 85:1 ratio.

It also owns a large copper deposit in Argentina. McEwen\u2019s goal is to create a profitable gold and silver producer focused in the Americas.\n\nMcEwen has approximately 362 million shares outstanding. Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner, owns 22% of the shares.\n\nReliability of Information Regarding San Jos\u00e9\n\nMinera Santa Cruz S.A., the owner of the San Jos\u00e9 Mine, is responsible for and has supplied to the Company all reported results from the San Jos\u00e9 Mine. McEwen Mining\u2019s joint venture partner, a subsidiary of Hochschild Mining plc, and its affiliates other than MSC do not accept responsibility for the use of project data or the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nTechnical Information\n\nThe technical contents of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Chris Stewart, P.Eng., President & COO of McEwen Mining and a Qualified Person as defined by Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 \"Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\"\n\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nIn this report, we have provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP, as well as provided some non-U.S. GAAP (\"non-GAAP\") performance measures. Because the non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nCash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs\n\nCash costs consist of mining, processing, on-site general and administrative costs, community and permitting costs related to current operations, royalty costs, refining and treatment charges (for both dor\u00e9 and concentrate products), sales costs, export taxes and operational stripping costs, and exclude depreciation and depletion. All-in sustaining costs consist of cash costs (as described above), plus environmental rehabilitation costs, amortization of the asset retirement costs related to operating sites, sustaining exploration and development costs, sustaining capital expenditures, and sustaining lease payments. Both cash costs and all-in sustaining costs are divided by the gold equivalent ounces sold to determine cash costs and all-in sustaining costs on a per ounce basis. For both cash costs and all-in sustaining costs we exclude our attributable share of cash costs from operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, such as MSC, where we hold a 49% interest. We use and report these measures to provide additional information regarding operational efficiencies both on a consolidated and an individual mine basis, and believe that these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about our underlying costs of operations. A reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure is provided in McEwen Mining's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n\nEarnings from mining operations\n\nThe term earnings from mining operations is a Non-GAAP financial measure. We use and report this metric because we believe it provides investors and analysts with a useful measure of the underlying earnings from our mining operations. We define earnings from mining operations as revenue from gold and silver sales from our El Gallo Project, Gold Bar mine, Black Fox mine, and our 49% attributable share of the San Jos\u00e9 mine\u2019s revenues from gold and silver sales, less their respective production costs applicable to sales and depreciation and depletion. To the extent that depreciation and depletion may include depreciation and amortization expense related to the fair value increments on historical business acquisitions (fair value paid in excess of the carrying value of the underlying assets and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition), we exclude this expense in order to arrive at depreciation and depletion that only includes depreciation and amortization expense incurred at the mine site level. A reconciliation to the nearest US GAAP measure, revenue from gold and silver sales, production costs applicable to sales and depreciation and depletion is provided in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n\nLiquid assets\n\nThe term liquid assets used in this report is a non\u2011GAAP financial measure. We report this measure to better understand our liquidity in each reporting period. Liquid assets is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments, trade receivable and ounces of dor\u00e9 held in precious metals inventories, with precious metals valued at the London PM Fix spot price at the corresponding period. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure is provided in McEwen Mining's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n\nCAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements and information, including \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
