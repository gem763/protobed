The Saudi ambassador left the room about an hour before to host his country\u2019s national day reception.\n\nThe kingdom has regularly denied allegations of torture and unfair detention.\n\nAmong those who addressed the Human Rights Council meeting was Lina al-Hathloul, whose sister \u2013 the Saudi women\u2019s activist Loujain al-Hathloul \u2013 was arrested last year and allegedly tortured, and whose release she called for.\n\nLoujain al-Hathloul was among about a dozen prominent activists who were arrested in May 2018 in the weeks before a ban on women driving cars in the conservative kingdom was lifted, apparently as a sop to hardline conservative elements in the kingdom, who opposed the lifting of the driving ban.\n\nIn an address to the council, al-Hathloul raised the detention of her sister and other female activists.\n\n\u201cLoujain was imprisoned for promoting the implementation of the Vienna declaration of human rights which affirms the full and equal enjoyment by women of all human rights.\n\n\u201cLoujain did not get to drive in her home town of Riyadh because she was arrested right before the Saudi government lifted the driving ban for women.\u201d\n\nShe added that her sister had been labelled a \u201ctraitor\u201d for her women\u2019s rights activism. \u201cThey tortured her and then attempted to trade her freedom in exchange for her publicly denying [her] torture.\u201d\n\nHuman rights organisations have, however, documented widespread use of torture in extracting confessions, including from individuals subsequently executed for participating in protests when they were minors.\n\nThe focus on Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record has intensified since the murder of Khashoggi, which has been widely blamed on the country\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nAgnes Callamard, the UN expert on extrajudicial executions worldwide, said in a report last June that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other senior officials should be investigated over Khashoggi\u2019s murder given what she called credible evidence against them.\n\nAlthough the joint statement acknowledged Saudi reforms, including the announcement last month that restrictions on the rights of women to travel will be lifted, it said deep concerns remained.\n\n\u201cHowever, we remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. Civil society actors in Saudi Arabia still face persecution and intimidation,\u201d Australia\u2019s ambassador Sally Mansfield said, reading out the statement.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned at reports of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, unfair trials and harassment of individuals engaged in promoting and defending human rights, their families and colleagues,\u201d she said.", "description": "Statement read out at UN human rights council meeting denounces alleged use of torture and unlawful detentions", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe499c2bcf616df929c57e790a6398e80723f44/0_424_3055_1833/master/3055.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=733c305e3ea13c5463f77bd08caa3bbb", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
