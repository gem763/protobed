Is this really the first anti-Trump Cavuto rant in a full year? The last one I blogged was August 24, 2018. (His recent tense exchange with Lou Dobbs over Trump\u2019s record doesn\u2019t count since that wasn\u2019t a prepared monologue.) Last year he\u2019d uncork a speech like this every few months. Wha\u2019 happened?\n\nAlso, was Cavuto the only Fox News host to call Trump out on the air this week for implying that Fox should be working for \u201cus\u201d? Shep probably did, although if so then I missed that too. Did any other anchor cowboy up or was it left to the genial midday guy to politely make the case that this news organization\u2019s first duty is to the truth?\n\nHere\u2019s what Cavuto\u2019s up against:\n\n[T]he biggest thing Trump has going for him is that he is extremely popular among Republicans \u2014 and that\u2019s true in virtually every poll. For example, 88 percent of the GOP approves of his job performance in the latest Gallup poll. (True, Trump approval isn\u2019t quite that high among voters who merely lean Republican, but even polls that incorporate leaners still give him overwhelming intraparty support \u2014 82 percent in one recent poll.) According to a CNN analysis from December, the only president in the last 70 years who was more beloved among members of his own party (as measured before the New Hampshire primary) was Dwight Eisenhower in 1956.\n\nPreviously, in order to achieve the level of support within one\u2019s party that Trump now enjoys within the GOP, one had to have been Supreme Allied Commander of the victorious European campaign to flatten the Nazis. No other Republican \u2014 or Democratic \u2014 president since Ike has reached the degree of unanimity of opinion in his favor on his own side that Trump is currently experiencing.\n\nGranted, some of that is due to former Republicans having left the party because they object to him, leaving behind a hardcore pro-Trump rump. But still, that\u2019s the audience Cavuto is pitching this at. How do you suppose it\u2019ll be received?\n\nThe most fun part of a Cavuto rant is the day after, when he reads all the hate mail he got overnight from angry Trumpers calling him fat, off his meds, and so on. There\u2019s bound to be a segment like that this afternoon. I\u2019ll post it later after it airs. As for this, everything he says is true, especially the part about Trump insisting that all bad news is necessarily fake news, one of his most persistent and obnoxious gaslighting flourishes. Exit question: When does Cavuto announce his primary challenge?", "description": "\u201c'Fake' is when it\u2019s wrong, Mr. President, not when it\u2019s unpleasant.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nc.jpg"}
