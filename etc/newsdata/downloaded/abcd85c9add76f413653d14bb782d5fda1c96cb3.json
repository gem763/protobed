In fact, some of the most exciting new openings in recent months are restaurants that boast centuries' worth of history and have been given a second life.\n\nFrom upscale to casual, classic and contemporary, to French and international, here's a list of some of the most exciting and dynamic dining experiences to be had in Paris, right now.\n\nBaieta\n\nl e v a r t\n\nDining at Baieta is sitting down to the future of French cuisine. Because steering the kitchen is Chef Julia Sedefdjian, who rose to fame in recent years after claiming the title of youngest female chef in France to hold a Michelin star.\n\nThe Nice native unlocked her first star in 2016 at the age of 21 while at Les Fables de la Fontaine in Paris. Fast forward to 2018, and the young chef is running her own restaurant Baieta, which means \"kiss\" in the Ni\u00e7ois dialect.\n\nIn early 2019, less than a year after opening, Sedefdjian earned another Michelin star -- this time for her own restaurant -- at the tender age of 24. One of the signature dishes on the menu is Bouillabaieta, a bouillabaisse with fish and shellfish nesting in a creamy, thickened fish stock, served with crispy toast and rouille on the side.\n\nBaieta , 5 rue de Pontoise, Paris, France, 75005; +33 01 42 02 59 19\n\nRelated content New crop of Paris restaurants are putting old French classics back on the menu\n\nRestaurant Lap\u00e9rouse\n\nLap\u00e9rouse has been hosting the great and the good since the 18th century.

Courtesy Alan Geaam\n\nLebanese chef Alan Geaam's life trajectory is, perhaps, one of France's favorite modern rags to riches tales. When he arrived from Lebanon to Paris 20 years ago, he had nothing but a seven-day visa and 200 Francs in his pocket (equal to about 40 euros today).\n\nHe slept in the park near the Eiffel Tower, painted houses and washed dishes to get by. When the chef at the Lebanese restaurant where he was a dishwasher fell ill, Geaam, who had served as a cook in the Lebanese military, stepped in.\n\nAs they say, the rest is history. In 2018, less than a year after opening, Geaam's eponymously named, Franco-Lebanese restaurant received its first Michelin star for giving Middle Eastern dishes and ingredients like Kefta, halloumi, labneh and falafels the haute gastronomy treatment.\n\nAlan Geaam , 19 Rue Lauriston, Paris, France, 75016; +33 01 45 01 72 97\n\nBeefbar Paris\n\nSet in a restored 19th century atrium, just off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Paris outpost of the Beefbar empire preserves its original Art Nouveau heritage with its mirrored walls and fairy goddess mural paintings.

Because as its name suggests, Beefbar was designed to be a high temple for carnivores.\n\nSet in a restored 19th century atrium, just off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Paris outpost of the Beefbar empire (other locations include Monaco, Hong Kong, Dubai, Cannes and Mykonos), preserves its original Art Nouveau heritage with its mirrored walls and fairy goddess mural paintings.\n\nMarble and brass details and a rich green and bronze color palette bring the d\u00e9cor to the 21st century. Meanwhile, under a soaring glass ceiling, Wagyu, Kobe and Black Angus beef from Japan, Australia, the US and France fill everything from burgers, tacos, bao buns, and kebabs.\n\nPurists can also tuck into filet mignon and Chateaubriand steak from the grill, be it barbecue or Teppanyaki. Moreover, the bright, airy dining space and jaw-dropping setting is also the place to see, and be seen, in Paris right now.\n\nBeefbar Paris , 5 Rue Marbeuf, Paris, France, 75008; +33 01 44 31 40 00\n\nLa Brasserie du Louvre-Bocuse\n\nThe first Paul Bocuse-branded restaurant in Paris reopened this past summer. Courtesy La Brasserie du Louvre-Bocuse\n\nAfter a two-year renovation, the H\u00f4tel du Louvre re-opened this summer with a star gastronomic attraction for the city: the first Paul Bocuse-branded restaurant in Paris. Despite being a giant in the gastronomic world, the late Bocuse \u2014 who has been called everything from the \"pope of French gastronomy\" to the \"chef of the century\" \u2014 had never operated a restaurant in the French capital.\n\nThe opening of Paris's first \"Brasserie Bocuse\" comes about a year and a half after the chef's death. Equidistant from the Jardin du Palais Royale and the Louvre museum, the restaurant menu pays homage to Bocuse's Lyonnaise roots with classic dishes like Bresse chicken in cream sauce with mushrooms, pike quenelle and onion soup.\n\nLa Brasserie du Louvre-Bocuse , H\u00f4tel du Louvre, Place Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Paris, France, 75001; +33 01 73 11 12 34\n\nCheval d'Or\n\nJapanese chef Taku Sekine draws inspiration from the flavors and fragrances of China, Thailand and Japan.

Dishes like scallops and yuzu; black vinegar farm chicken; and steamed bream with ginger draw inspiration from the flavors and fragrances of Chinese, Thai and Japanese cuisines.\n\nCheval d'Or , 21 rue de la Villette, 75019 Paris Tel: +33 09 54 12 21 77\n\nFulgurances\n\nFulgurances, which translates to \"brilliance\" in French, is where restless passion and emerging talent collide happily with carte blanche.

Opened by a French food magazine of the same name as an incubator for young chefs looking to branch out on their own, the concept restaurant gives emerging new talent their own stage with a kitchen, staff and dining room.\n\nFulgurances, which translates to \"brilliance\" in French, is where restless passion and emerging talent collide happily with carte blanche. The rotating list of chefs include sous chefs, entry-level chefs and alumni from some of the most illustrious addresses in Paris and around the world, including Septime, L'Agap\u00e9 and L'Astrance in Paris, along with Pujol in Mexico City, Mugaritz and the defunct elBulli in Spain.\n\nResident and guest chefs have gone on to make names for themselves or open new restaurants of their own. Currently steering the kitchen is Franco-Japanese chef Akan\u00e9 Monavon, who has worked alongside star Peruvian chef Virgilio Martinez and triple Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn in San Francisco.\n\nFulgurances , 10 rue Alexandre Dumas, Paris, France, 75011; +33 01 43 48 14 59\n\nCaf\u00e9 Pouchkine\n\nFind some of Paris' best pastries at Cafe Pouchkine. Courtesy Cafe Pouchkine\n\nAt Caf\u00e9 Pouchkine, guests get a taste of Russian finery and flavors in the heart of Paris.\n\nJust as the d\u00e9cor marries the gold-gilded aesthetic of French and Russian opulence -- Moscovite crafts meet French antiques to furnish the four salons -- Russian dishes like borscht, beef stroganoff, blini and Russian stacking doll \"Matriochka\" cakes are made with locally sourced farm fresh eggs and beef from the Aubrac region of France. Meanwhile, the caf\u00e9 has a strong French connection.\n\nIn 1964, French singer-songwriter Gilbert B\u00e9caud released a song about his tour guide \"Nathalie\" after returning from a trip to Moscow, singing about a fictional Caf\u00e9 Pouchkine. The song topped the charts in France, but left disappointed French visitors to Moscow looking in vain for the caf\u00e9. Franco-Russian restaurateur Andrei Dellos opened the original Caf\u00e9 Pushkin (get it, Pouchkine?) in Moscow in 1999 to pay homage in part to the French song, and to the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin; Dellos opened this Paris location in 2017.", "description": "The restaurant scene in Paris continues to thrive -- and change.
