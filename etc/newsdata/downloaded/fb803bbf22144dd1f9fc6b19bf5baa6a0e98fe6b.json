The Broncos are, somehow, the first team to accomplish that feat. It\u2019s also worth noting that the great Von Miller \u2014 who also doesn\u2019t have a single quarterback hit in 94.9 percent of the defensive snaps \u2014 has been missing in action, too.\n\nLet\u2019s, however, put the defense on the back burner because it still hasn\u2019t played poorly and hasn\u2019t been the primary reason the Broncos have lost.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNo. That would be the offense, which complements a strong run game led by one of my favorite running backs (the hard-charging Phillip Lindsay) with one of the league\u2019s least-impressive passing games.\n\n(Yahoo Sports)\n\nI know, I know. With Joe Flacco at the helm, big shock. But one of the first Things I Noticed while reviewing an interesting spate of Week 3 games were the Broncos\u2019 passing issues, which will be amplified this Sunday against a jacked-up Jacksonville Jaguars defense that\u2019s coming off a killer performance in a 20-7 Thursday night win over Tennessee.\n\nQuarterback Joe Flacco took it on chin against a nasty Packers defense in Week 3. More pain might be in the forecast as the Broncos next face the Jaguars. (Getty Images)\n\nAs I detailed in the video above \u2014 produced by my main man Ron Schiltz \u2014 the Broncos have reason to fear the Jaguars\u2019 D, which was downright menacing against the Titans, racking up an insane nine sacks and 13 quarterback hits against a far-too-passive Marcus Mariota.\n\nThe effort was led by stud Calais Campbell, who notched three sacks and five quarterback hits in the single-best performance by a defensive lineman this year. That\u2019s something considering the way Green Bay\u2019s Preston Smith (the NFC Defensive Player of the Week) has been playing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd considering the way Smith and the Packers terrorized Broncos right tackle Elijah Wilkinson and his fellow O-linemen this past week, it\u2019s hard to see Denver blocking a front led by Campbell \u2014 a Denver native who is already talking about looking forward to his second pro game in the Mile High City \u2014 especially if Flacco doesn\u2019t stop holding onto the ball.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a few of those where he held onto it for a long time,\u201d Fangio said after the Broncos\u2019 most recent loss. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much time you can hold it back there, and Joe\u2019s got to do a better job of getting it out quicker.\u201d\n\nSo yes, Flacco better heed Fangio\u2019s words and Denver better jump out to an early lead against Jacksonville. Otherwise, the Jaguars\u2019 fearsome D-line could tee off on an overmatched front (and QB) that has surrendered the sixth-most sacks in the league (11).\n\n2. The heir to Cam\u2019s throne?\n\nLet\u2019s hear it for the Carolina Panthers! Now this is the team we thought could contend for the NFC South title.\n\nGranted, they beat the fledgling Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. But their 38-20 win was a complete performance, one led by a speedy defense that did an outstanding job corralling the elusive Kyler Murray (eight sacks) and a superb performance by backup quarterback Kyle Allen, who completed 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nAllen was more than \u201cfunctional\u201d in place of Cam Newton on Sunday. He was decisive, he threw in rhythm and he made some downright killer, big-boy throws.\n\nCheck these out, folks:\n\nAllen was making throws on the move, off his back foot, in tight coverage \u2026 and I\u2019m just saying, if he continues to make throws like this over the coming weeks, and the Panthers keep winning, there are going to be calls to keep him in the mix even when Newton heals from a mid-foot sprain, especially because Allen apparently doesn\u2019t lack cool or confidence.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s real confident in who he is as a football player,\u201d Carolina coach Ron Rivera said recently. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of swag, which is kind of interesting when you watch him, and he\u2019s been able to back that up. He did it in high school, he did it in college, and the two times he\u2019s played for us, he\u2019s played pretty well.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if he can keep it going this weekend against the Texans, who rank 23rd in pass defense and have notched only one interception through three games.\n\n3. Carson Wentz\u2019s kryptonite?\n\nOne of Matt Patricia\u2019s favorite ways to frustrate an offense as head coach of the Detroit Lions is to rush just three men and drop eight into coverage. It\u2019s something the New England Patriots, where he was defensive coordinator from 2012-2017, liked to do in recent years, and Patricia has continued that trend.\n\nIt was noticeable late in the Lions\u2019 surprising 27-24 win over the Philadelphia Eagles when the Lions, who led by three, dropped eight men into coverage with successful results, as quarterback Carson Wentz went 1-for-4 for 5 yards and a 6-yard fourth-down scramble that fell 2 yards short of the marker.\n\nPatricia loves to drop eight, especially when the goal is to take away the deep routes, play bend-but-don\u2019t break and allow the clock to run. It will be fascinating to see if he tries it in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes, who I\u2019m convinced could regularly complete passes against 12-man defenses, let alone 11.\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on whether Wentz faces more three-man rushes on Thursday night against an aggressive Green Bay defense that rushed two or three at a 13.5 percent clip in 2018 \u2014 the fifth-most in the league \u2014 under Mike Pettine.\n\n4. Play this fearless tight end in fantasy this week\n\nAnother revelation in 2019 has been Seattle tight end Will Dissly, who has been killing it to such a degree that the Seahawks traded tight end Nick Vannett \u2014 a third-round pick in 2016 who is coming off a career season \u2014 to the tight end-needy Steelers for a 2020 fifth-round pick.\n\nDissly, a fourth-round pick a year ago, has caught 12 of 14 targets for 124 yards this year, and he does his best work in the red zone, where he can use his size (6-foot-4, 265 pounds), toughness and feel for finding open space to win in close quarters. It\u2019s no coincidence that all three of his touchdowns this year have come in the red area. His fearlessness when he knows he\u2019s gonna take a lick stands out. Here are five plays that show that:\n\nDon\u2019t bet on Dissly\u2019s strong run ending anytime soon. Seattle\u2019s next opponent is Arizona, which has gotten pillaged by tight ends in all three games it has played this season as Carolina\u2019s Greg Olsen (six catches, 75 yards, two touchdowns), Detroit\u2019s rookie T.J. Hockenson (six catches, 131 yards and touchdown) and Baltimore's Mark Andrews (eight catches, 112 yards, one touchdown) all found room to roam.\n\nFor more film analysis over the course of the week, check out my Snapchat (Terez_Paylor).\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Considering how the Pack terrorized the Broncos' O-linemen, it\u2019s hard to see Denver blocking the Jags \u2013 especially if Flacco keeps holding onto the ball.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eAirN0EmD4yFiK0qlh_63w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H9sc9ebP7MWeSEnlFoKckg--~B/aD0xNDcxO3c9MjIxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/664caa10-dfd1-11e9-bef7-7468e4a22135", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
