They approved us staying there.\u201d\n\nThe Trump golf resort where Vice President Mike Pence stayed in Doonbeg, Ireland.

He was staying both nights at the resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and flew across the country to Dublin for the day Tuesday, where he met with the Irish president and the prime minister to discuss issues including trade, immigration and Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to imagine that there was no place closer and more convenient and cheaper, in essentially all of Ireland, than this,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not convenient. It\u2019s clearly not efficient. There\u2019s really no explanation besides promoting the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has faced criticism for blurring the lines between his business and his presidency. Breaking with precedent, Mr. Trump after his election decided to retain ownership of his company, the Trump Organization, and turned over management to his two oldest sons.\n\nIrish President Michael D.

He also has proposed holding the next Group of Seven meeting at the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort.\n\nMr. Pence, who was joined by his wife, mother and sister, has Irish roots and ties directly to Doonbeg, where a distant relation owns a pub. Mr. Short noted that the vice president was originally supposed to travel to Dublin from London later this week and spend one night in the Doonbeg area, but his travel had to be reorganized after he was asked to visit Poland over the weekend in lieu of Mr. Trump due to Hurricane Dorian.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you hope comes from Vice President Mike Pence meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Pence is paying personally for his mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s travel for the entire trip, Mr. Short said.\n\nVisiting Ireland has personal significance for the vice president, whose grandfather emigrated to the U.S. from County Sligo in 1923. The vice president has spoken emotionally about his grandfather, who became a bus driver in Chicago, and his roots.\n\nMr. Pence met with both Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and President Michael D. Higgins Tuesday. In the Irish president\u2019s residence in Dublin, Mr. Pence signed a guest book, writing \u201cin memory of a great Irishman\u2014 Richard Michael Cawley \u2014and on behalf of the United States of America we are delighted to be back in Ireland.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Pence visited the restaurant, Morrissey\u2019s Pub in Doonbeg. A sign in the window read \u201cWelcome Pence.\u201d The street was shut down, and people looked on from behind barricades as Mr. Pence arrived with his family. He was greeted by the distant relation that owns the pub and shook hands with people in the crowd, pointing out the house that used to be his great-grandmother\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a wonderful dinner,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\n\u2014Andrew Restuccia in Washington and Alex Leary contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence defended his two-night stay at President Trump\u2019s golf resort on an official visit to Ireland, as critics question whether he is using public dollars to benefit the president.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103426/social"}
