There might be more no-confidence votes, however, in coming weeks. With May's attempt at Brexit having failed, it is now up to Parliament to come up with an alternative. The chamber's view is clear on one point: There is an overwhelming consensus on both sides of the aisle that a no-deal Brexit cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nThe only choice left would seem to be no Brexit. Britain can change its mind and decide to stay in the EU after all, or it can ask the EU to agree to a delay, pending a second referendum. That second referendum would probably result in a vote to remain, especially given that about 1.5 million young voters have become eligible to vote since the 2016 referendum, and a huge majority of young Britons want to be part of Europe.\n\nBe smart: Don't believe anybody who tells you that they know how this is all going to play out. Britain is caught up in political chaos, and just about any option is still possible, including a hard Brexit, another general election, or a change in Conservative party leadership. That said, the possibility that Brexit might not happen at all is looking increasingly likely.\n\nGo deeper: Second Brexit referendum looks more likely than ever", "description": "Don't believe anybody who tells you that they know how this is all going to play out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/oARQGESaulGpbKlqOq8RlM0eMdQ=/0x353:4901x3110/1920x1080/2019/01/16/1547642644923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-16"}
