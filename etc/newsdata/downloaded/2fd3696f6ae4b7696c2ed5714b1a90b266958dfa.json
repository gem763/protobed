I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.\u201d\n\nMs Tra My is reported to have paid a charge of about \u00a330,000 to people smugglers in order to be brought into the UK illegally.\n\nHer father, Pham Van Thin, told Sky News: \u201cWe tried to talk her out of it because it would be a very difficult journey for her as a girl.\n\n\u201cBut she said: \u2018If I don\u2019t go, the family would stay in a very difficult situation because of the big debt\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo she took a risk and decided to go, and we had to agree.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe all have been in shock. I cannot explain our pain and devastating feeling. We were all very devastated and sad.\u201d\n\nHe told CNN that smugglers said the crossing was \u201ca safe route\u201d and that people would go by aeroplane or car.\n\n\u201cIf I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,\u201d the father said.\n\nThe bodies of 39 people found inside a lorry in Essex have yet to be identified (Kirsty O\u00b4Connor/PA)\n\nAll of the victims have since been moved from the vehicle in Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford for post-mortem examinations to be carried out.\n\nEssex Police are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in its history, having previously said all were from China.\n\nInvestigators will look at tattoos, scars and belongings, including jewellery and clothing, with each of the victims said to have had some kind of bag.\n\nMore than 500 exhibits have been collected, including mobile phones, which will be downloaded and interrogated for any messages that could give clues to the identity of the victims or how they came to be in the back of the trailer.\n\nDetectives are investigating a \u201cwider conspiracy\u201d after claims surfaced that the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying around 100 people.\n\nThe mother and a sister of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung set up an altar in the village of Yen Thanh in north-central Vietnam after a family friend in the UK told them she had died after paying thousands of pounds in the hope of finding work in a nail bar.\n\nAnother Vietnamese father, Nguyen Dinh Gia, fears his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, was among the victims.\n\nThe Vietnamese Embassy in London has started a hotline while the ambassador to the UK, Tran Ngoc An, spoke to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday night before meeting investigators from the National Crime Agency and Essex Police.\n\nThe victims were found in a container on an industrial estate in Grays on Eastern Avenue, Essex (Kirsty O\u00b4Connor/PA)\n\nLorry driver Robinson is expected to appear before magistrates in Chelmsford on Monday.\n\nThree other suspects have been released on bail.
