Umar\u2019s wife was among six Pakistani women and a Bangladeshi national arrested, and a huge cache of weapons was recovered.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

They say that Umar had been tracked to the compound in the town of Musa Qala after extensive surveillance and was about to carry out terrorist acts when the military mission was authorised.\n\nAQIS, which was set up by Zawahiri in 2014, is known to have operated in Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as Afghanistan. It is not known to have a strong presence in India, but has received support from some Kashmiri separatist groups, including Anasurut-Tawhid Wai Jihad Kashmir.\n\nFour years ago, US forces raided an AQIS training facility in Kandahar, where they are believed to have established bases before branching out to Helmand, the former centre of British operations in Afghanistan. The town of Musa Qala, where the raid took place, had particular resonance, having changed hands several times under a British strategy of engagement with the Talibs, one which the Americans were highly critical.\n\nUS and Afghan forces faced fierce resistance, according to American officials, from a combined group of determined al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters when they surrounded a compound in Musa Qala late on Sunday night, with a firefight lasting more than six hours.\n\nUS warplanes were then called in to break the stalemate and carried out what American officials described as \u201cprecision strikes\u201d, followed by the troops moving in.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Because of the heavy fighting, we did conduct targeted precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and US forces.\u201d\n\nUS officials say that they are attempting to establish whether women, apart from the ones they had captured, may have been hiding in the compound when the shooting and air strikes were taking place.\n\nMohammed Zaman Hamdard, an official with the Helmand police force, said that the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had fled into people\u2019s homes during the raid and started shooting from there, drawing fire back in response. As a result \u201cthree women are among the dead, and three children are wounded\u201d, he stated.\n\nKarim Atal, a member of Helmand\u2019s Provincial Council, said it had not been possible to obtain reliable information because mobile phones were not working in the area. US-led forces jam signals as a matter of routine during operations. \u201cSome say 14 civilians were killed, others says 60, many are saying 40,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdul Majid Akhunzada, a fellow council member, claimed that at least 12 people from a wedding party were wounded in the air strike, but he was unaware of their identities. Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the Helmand Governorate, claimed that three cars had been hit from the air, but the numbers of wounded were unclear.\n\nRead the first part of the Conflict Without End series here: Afghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption; and the second part here: Afghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: \u2018My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up\u2019", "description": "US and Afghan Special Forces carried out a raid in Helmand specifically targeting a senior al-Qaeda leader who was hiding in a bomb factory which was producing explosive devices possibly to be used against voters in the impending presidential election, security officials have claimed.", "authors": ["Kim Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/17/Afghanistan-helmand.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
