It\u2019s the season for perfect crisp weather, vibrant colors and gastronomic delights like chestnut and pumpkin as well as slightly less delightful mystery fruits and edible insects.\n\nWhether you choose to hike or bike on forest trails, ride a ropeway up a mountain or take a scenic train route, there\u2019s no shortage of spots across Japan to view the colorful displays of fall. Top it all off in one relaxing weekend getaway to maximize your experience by soaking in an onsen (hot spring) while taking in the sights of auburn, gold, brown and orange leaves\u2014the autumn colors known as koyo in Japanese.\n\nThe act of deeply appreciating the autumn colors is culturally referred to as the \u201ckoyo season,\u201d which typically begins in October in the north and creates a magnificent color gradient gently spreading to the rest of the country through November to early December.\n\nFor an onsen-and-fall-colors combo, we bring you 10 locations that will broaden your Japan horizons and offer the perfect weekend getaway across Japan, starting in northernmost Hokkaido all the way south to the remote island region of Shikoku.\n\n2019 Japan Fall Foliage Forecast\n\nAccording to the Japan Meteorological Corporation, the latest updates predict that the leaves will begin changing color from mid-October in the north part of the country (Hokkaido, Tohoku), and from late November on the west/south side (Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka) and the east side (Tokyo, Nagoya, Mt. Fuji).\n\nPredicted peak viewing dates for yellow leaves\n\nPredicted peak viewing dates for red leaves\n\nFor the destinations below, we\u2019ve listed the dates when the koyo is predicted to be at peak photogenic-ness this year. That said, the leaves take between two to three weeks to fully turn\u2014so you\u2019ll be able to catch them if you visit in that 21-day window.
