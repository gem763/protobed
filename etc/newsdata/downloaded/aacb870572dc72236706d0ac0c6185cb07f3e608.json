If the perpetrators are identified they will be dealt with in the strongest manner by the club and be reported to the Police immediately.\n\n\"Our security staff will be vigilant at forthcoming games to ensure that anybody attempting repetition of this chant will be dealt with severely.\n\n\"We know we can rely on the assistance of the majority of our fans to eradicate this toxic behaviour immediately.\n\n\"If anyone has any information please contact the club on 0121 327 2299.\"\n\nAston Villa FC have been contacted for comment.", "description": "Footage has emerged of fans singing offensive song prior to Villans' pre-season match against RB Leipzig in the summer", "authors": ["Ned Keating"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537719.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195417924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
