Apple says that it should work in all browsers, including Google Chrome, and on all devices, including Windows 10, Chrome OS, and even mobile platforms like Android.\n\nApple Music, minus the app\n\nThe site offers access to the entire Apple Music catalog as well as any tracks users have synced to their libraries that aren\u2019t on Apple Music. Playlists \u2014 including Apple\u2019s personalized \u201cFor You\u201d recommendations \u2014 and Apple Music\u2019s radio stations will be available as part of the beta, too.\n\nThe beta site will be missing some features, including the flagship Beats 1 live broadcast, some of Apple\u2019s original music video content, and smart playlists. But Apple says it\u2019ll continue to build out the website over time. Additionally, you\u2019ll eventually be able to sign up for Apple Music directly from the web, although that won\u2019t be available in this version of the beta.\n\nAs for the logic of adding a web interface, the move allows Apple to bring Apple Music to other platforms \u2014 like Chrome OS or Linux \u2014 without having to develop and support a custom app for each platform. Web support also puts Apple on par with its biggest competitor in the music sphere: Spotify. The Swedish streaming service, which became the first platform to hit 100 million paid subscribers earlier this year, has offered a web player for years that allows subscribers to access music without having to install a full-fledged app.", "description": "Apple Music is getting a big expansion with a new web interface that will let subscribers stream music directly from a browser without having to install iTunes or a separate Apple Music app. The new web interface launches on September 5th as a public beta for subscribers at beta.music.apple.com.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGorzWq0gdcloDFfxeLD6y_6ySo=/0x65:1280x735/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19171258/applemusicweb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
