He made those plans when he thought they\u2019d all be in their apartment just outside Kuwait City, when the 10-year-old and 6-year-old would be back at school and his infant son would be home with mom, and he would kiss everyone goodbye and be back in a couple of days with gifts from America.\n\nBut everything changed those first days in August, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. It was a frightening time.\n\n\u201cIt is seared in me,\u201d said Afif Ghannoum, the scientist\u2019s oldest son, who was 10 when he watched the invasion of his homeland on television. \u201cThe fear. The look on my parents\u2019 faces, knowing that everything we had was gone.\u201d\n\nA mother\u2019s leap of faith and a 15-year mystery\n\nAll their assets were frozen, they didn\u2019t know if their home had survived the invasion. And a real future in England wasn\u2019t likely.\n\n\u201cI know in England, he could\u2019ve just ended up as one of those stories: \u2018That guy\u2019s a scientist who now works at a fish-and-chips shop,\u2019 \u201d Afif said.\n\nThat trip to Washington was the key to a new life in America. If dad could make a connection and find a job, it would work out, they figured. He printed out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, borrowed a suit and flew to the United States. He had two days.\n\nBut it was the wrong conference for job hunting, the scientists there told him. If he could just wait in D.C. for a week, the people doing all the hiring in his field would be in town the next week and he\u2019d surely get a job, they said.\n\nWaiting a week in Washington? Impossible.\n\n\u201cThere was truly no money,\u201d Afif said. \u201cHe was eating apples out of the hotel lobby. There was no way to just Venmo him some cash or anything. He had nowhere to stay, no place to go.\u201d\n\nBut the family had one friend in America, a man in Milwaukee. If Ghannoum could get to Milwaukee, he could stay there, then return to Washington to meet with the people who could hire him.\n\nOn a whim, as he was walking from the conference rooms at the Willard Hotel and trying to hatch a plan, he stopped at a travel agency.\n\n\u201cI saw this travel agent who was a black guy,\u201d he said. The man behind the counter looked up and asked Ghannoum, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d All he had was this one-way airline ticket back to England. He asked the agent if he could somehow reroute it to Milwaukee. The agent told him he\u2019d lose his job if he did that.\n\n\u201cAnd I told him, \u2018I am struggling. I see you are black, and you\u2019ve struggled, too. I need your help,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThe travel agent listened to the story from this Muslim man with a mustache and a brown suit, told through Ghannoum\u2019s thick accent.\n\nThe travel agent didn\u2019t turn him away, didn\u2019t suspect a scam. He bought Ghannoum a round-trip ticket to Milwaukee, returning to D.C. in time to meet with prospective employers. And then he opened his wallet and gave him $80 cash. \u201cSo you have some spending money,\u201d he told him.\n\nThe next week, the scientist met with all the hiring people. \u201cI got two job offers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I returned to London, I was crying. It all happened because of that man in the travel agency.\u201d\n\nAll we can do is cry now\n\nYou know how you see probiotic health this? And gut health that? Ghannoum is the man primarily responsible for that research. He\u2019s the scientist who named the mycobiome, he\u2019s published more than 400 papers on the topic, lectures all over the world and has been funded by the National Institutes of Health for more than 25 years, with almost $50 million in grants. He\u2019s a professor and the director of the Center for Medical Mycology at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. He\u2019s even a big deal on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop, y\u2019all.\n\nAnd he firmly believes he was able to do all this because of the kindness of that travel agent.\n\nHe should have gotten the man\u2019s name and the address of the travel agency so he could pay him back, but he didn\u2019t. He remembers that the man was young, with close-cropped hair and he wore dark trousers and a white shirt. It was in late 1990.\n\nThe thousandth time Afif heard the story, sometime this summer, it dawned on him that social media could help. So he posted about the search on Facebook. So far, no luck.\n\n\u201cThis man, this travel agent, he is the good of America,\u201d he said. \u201cI go to Europe and they ask me \u2018What\u2019s going on in America?\u2019 And I tell them, America is good. It\u2019s still good. The people are good. And I tell them this story.\u201d\n\nGhannoum could have tried to stay in England. But he believes the innovation and support he got here were uniquely American. He became a force here and his children grew up to be a lawyer, a teacher and a mechanical engineer.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is the best place in the world. They welcome you, irrespective of your background. I am just one example of how immigrants enrich this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now \u2014 the demonizing of immigrants \u2014 is alien.\u201d\n\nHey, mystery travel agent? Are you out there? Please raise your hand and remind us of how good we can be.\n\nTwitter: @petulad\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nTrump has to build a wall and military families have to get in the back of the line\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned in 10 years as a columnist\n\nGot white teen boys?
