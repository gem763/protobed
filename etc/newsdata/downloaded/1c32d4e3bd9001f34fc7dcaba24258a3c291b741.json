The Chimu were a pre-Incan culture that emerged out of the remnants of the Moche culture along the coast of Peru in 900AD. It was the largest pre-Columbian Empire in Peru until the Inca. The Chimu people lived in a strip of desert, 20 to 100 miles (30 to 160 km) wide, between the Pacific and the Andes. It\u2019s thought that the Chim\u00fa culture arose in the first half of the 14th century, developing a complex civilization with different levels of social hierarchy. They built cities and large irrigation systems, according to Britannica. The culture was dominated by agriculture, though they also became known for their stunning textiles and pottery, now famed for their black ceramics and intricately worked precious metals. The Chimu are thought to have survived by fishing and worshipped the moon, believing it to be more powerful than the sun. Archaeologists believe they practised ritual sacrifice. Around 1470 AD, the Inca ruler Tupac Inca Yupanqui conquered the Chimu. The Inca subsequently absorbed many of their practices, including political organization, irrigation systems, and road engineering. Yupanqui's rule was short lived, however, as the Spanish conquered the region in 1534 AD.\n\nThere is very little evidence, before this discovery, of the brutal practice in this region of South America.\n\nProfessor Prieto said: 'In number, it greatly exceeds the known sample of Inca child sacrifices from high altitude sites in the Andes.\n\n'It also is substantially larger than the only other mass sacrifice of children known from the New World, that of 42 children in Offering 48 at the Mexica Templo Mayor in Central Mexico.\n\n'The presence of a thick layer of mud on top of the sand in which the children and camelids were buried, as well as the presence of human and animal footprints made while the mud was still wet, suggest that the sacrificial event occurred shortly after heavy rainfall and flooding, in an arid region that receives negligible rainfall under normal conditions.\n\n'While the correlation between heavy rains and the sacrifice may be coincidental, it is tempting to hypothesise that the two events are associate, and that the mass offering of children and camelids may have been an attempt to appease the gods and mitigate the effects of a major El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation event that occurred around 1400-1450.'\n\nThe Huanchaquito-Las Llamas burial site is a 7,500 square foot area located less than half a mile from the Chimu's capital Chan Chan, a UNESCO World Heritage site", "description": "Analysis of the remains of more than 200 juvenile llamas dates it to approximately 1450 - at the peak of the\u00a0Chimu civilisation in northern coastal Peru.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/06/22/10672156-0-image-a-41_1551911130219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-06"}
