Perhaps not coincidentally, the firm determined that the Russians were behind the intrusion. CrowdStrike\u2019s June 2016 assessment remains the sole source of evidence to supply the pretext of the government\u2019s Russian election interference claim; later, it would help bolster the Trump-Russia collusion fable.\n\nThe president, according to a transcript released by the White House, mentioned CrowdStrike during a phone call with the new Ukranian president over the summer. Now, the California-based company is facing renewed scrutiny both about the handling of the DNC email hack and the firm\u2019s political affiliations. Last month, in response to questions about the firm\u2019s clear connections to Democrats, CrowdStrike rejected accusations of bias in an FAQ posted on its website:\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike is not affiliated with any political party. We are a public cybersecurity company, and are non-partisan. We have done cybersecurity work for, and currently protect, both Republican and Democratic political organizations at the state, local, and federal level.\u201d\n\nThat may be true in the most technical sense, but there are plenty of reasons to suspect that CrowdStrike is far from a disinterested player in the impeachment drama engulfing official Washington and gaslighting the American public. And since CrowdStrike produced the single piece of evidence used in the endless feedback loop to convince Americans that the Russians breached the DNC\u2019s email system\u2014the party refused to surrender its email devices to the FBI\u2014reassessing the firm\u2019s credibility in light of new information is warranted; in fact, it\u2019s vital.\n\nHenry, the president of CrowdStrike\u2019s Washington operation, is a regular contributor to both MSNBC and NBC News programs. (His affiliation with CrowdStrike, however, is never mentioned.) Although he hasn\u2019t worked for the FBI since 2012, Henry often weighs in as an FBI \u201cexpert,\u201d opining on a variety of political issues from government shutdowns to the Kavanaugh debacle. Curiously, his views always come down on the side opposite of Donald Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nIn March 2017, Henry\u2014who worked for Robert Mueller\u2019s FBI during Barack Obama\u2019s first term\u2014participated in a post-inauguration forum to discuss the implications of Russia\u2019s \u201chacking\u201d the 2016 presidential election. The panel also featured former Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and Marc Elias, the general partner at Perkins Coie, a politically-influential law firm based in D.C..\n\nIt was a symbolic trio. Perkins Coie hired CrowdStrike in the spring of 2016 on behalf of the DNC. Instead of going directly to the FBI or other law enforcement agency about the breach, Democratic party leaders, working through Perkins Coie, retained CrowdStrike to find the culprits. Very cozy.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t Perkins Coie\u2019s only involvement in the Russia-hacked-the-election plotline. The law firm also hired Fusion GPS\u2014who in turn hired British political operative Christopher Steele to author his infamous dossier\u2014on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC around the same time Perkins retained CrowdStrike. According to disclosure reports, the DNC paid Perkins Coie $7.2 million during the 2016 election cycle: The PAC also paid CrowdStrike more than $400,000 during the same time period. (The DNC has paid CrowdStrike nearly $80,000 so far this year.)\n\nAnd while CrowdStrike was working for the DNC in 2016, the firm also collaborated with key officials in the Obama Justice Department as it was ramping up its investigation into Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. During a technology conference in March 2016, CrowdStrike hosted a cyber \u201cwar game\u201d with Obama administration officials: \u201cFour teams of ten people met for two hours to play the game,\u201d according to an October 2016 profile in Esquire. \u201c[National Security Division chief] John Carlin; Chris Painter\u2026at the State Department; and Chris Inglis, the former deputy director of the NSA, were all part of the government team. A former member of GCHQ, the British intelligence organization, was on the international team. Ash Carter, the defense secretary, arrived halfway through and asked to play, but the game was already under way.\u201d\n\nBefore Obama\u2019s intelligence officials released a statement on October 7 that blamed the Russians for the DNC email breach, according to the Esquire article, Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder, was given a heads-up. \u201cAlperovitch got a phone call from a senior government official alerting him that a statement identifying Russia as the sponsor of the DNC attack would soon be released. Once again, Alperovitch was thanked for pushing the government along.\u201d The statement, issued by Obama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper one month before Election Day, lifted some of the wording from CrowdStrike\u2019s report on the DNC breach. (Again, it\u2019s important to note that no federal agency was allowed access to the DNC email servers; all evidence of Russian hacking came directly from CrowdStrike.)\n\nFurther, according to reporting by Michael Tracey, CrowdStrike had a contract with the FBI for $150,000 between July 2015 and July 2016 for unknown services.\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo, to summarize, at the same time Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS to dig up Russia-related dirt on Donald Trump, it hired CrowdStrike to investigate the hack of the DNC email systems. CrowdStrike, also at the same time, was working with the Obama Justice Department as the agency began investigating Trump campaign aides for suspected \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Kremlin.\n\nEven if one accepts those connections as standard Washington operating procedure, Henry\u2019s political commentary should be enough to give more fair-minded observers pause about his company\u2019s objectivity. In August, Henry appeared on Andrea Mitchell\u2019s MSNBC show to push for stricter gun control in the aftermath of the El Paso mass shooting. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole host of things that need to be done to change the climate, background investigations, background checks, will keep guns out of the hands of bad people,\u201d Henry said on August 8. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot more that needs to be done in order to successfully mitigate what we\u2019ve seen here over the past few years.\u201d Yes, because mass shootings only started happening after Bad Orange Man was elected.\n\nLast January, during the government shutdown, Henry warned that the move was affecting the \u201cmorale\u201d of the FBI and threatened national security. \u201cThese operations are being impacted and that is a risk to the American public, it\u2019s a risk to this country and it is absolutely a national security challenge,\u201d Henry told MSNBC\u2019s Brian Williams on January 23.\n\nHenry also lamented the climate at the FBI after the arrest of the so-called package bomber Casar Sayoc last year. \u201cWhat the FBI has gone through has been some morale issues of course with a lot of the language that\u2019s been out there,\u201d Henry said on the \u201cToday\u201d show on October 27, 2018. The language, it\u2019s safe to assume, was criticism by President Trump, congressional Republicans and conservative media about the FBI\u2019s activities in 2016 and 2017.\n\nTrump foes dismiss any scrutiny of CrowdStrike as part of a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d But the tangled web between CrowdStrike, Democratic operatives, the Trump-hating media and the Obama Justice Department isn\u2019t a theory, it is fact. And since the firm played a critical early role in planting the Russia collusion hoax, Trump and his allies are right to raise more questions.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JK_.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
