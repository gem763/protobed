I am truly sorry,\" Cherelus wrote.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES EDITOR APOLOGIZES AFTER OLD, OFFENSIVE TWEETS RESURFACE\n\nIn a pair of tweets from 2012, Cherelus slammed \"Asian nail salons,\" saying \"they feel f---ing entitled\" and \"don't know anything but basic ghetto s---.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying all Asians aren't able, but this can really cause you to make hasty generalizations,\" Cherelus wrote.\n\nCherelus used a Hispanic slur against another Twitter user, who appears to be a friend of hers, calling him a \"wetback.\"\n\nThe Times staffer also used several homophobic slurs, including \"f----ts,\" \"d---s,\" and \"n---- queer.\"\n\nThis caught the attention of Donald Trump Jr., who blasted The Times for hiring \"another bigot.\"\n\n\"Another day, another bigot exposed at the @nytimes. Are they ever going to do anything to address the rampant hatred at their paper?\" Trump Jr. asked.\n\nCherelus and The New York Times did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.\n\nLast month, an editor for The Times apologized for tweets he sent more than a decade ago resurfaced online.\n\nTom Wright-Piersanti had made numerous anti-Semitic and racist tweets that dated back to 2008, some of which have since been deleted.\n\nFor instance, on Jan. 1, 2010, he wrote: \"I was going to say 'Crappy Jew Year,' but one of my resolutions is to be less anti-Semitic. So... HAPPY Jew Year. You Jews.\"\n\nIn another post, from 2009, Wright-Piersanti shared an image of a car with a giant lit menorah on top of it and tweeted, \"Who called the Jew-police?\"\n\nWright-Piersanti also made several derogatory tweets aimed at \"Indians\" in 2008 and 2009.\n\nA spokesperson for The Times told Fox News: \"We are aware of these tweets, which are a clear violation of our standards. We are reviewing next steps.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis latest Twitter-related controversy comes on the heels of the backlash the paper faced over its story about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nLate Sunday, The Times walked back an explosive report about a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Kavanaugh from his college days. The piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, alleged there was corroboration of an incident in which Kavanaugh, as a college student at Yale, exposed himself to a female classmate at a party.\n\nHowever, The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway -- who reviewed an advance copy of the book \u2013 flagged an omission and the paper eventually revised the controversial story after being lampooned on social media over the gaffe.\n\nThe update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault. The newspaper also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.", "description": "Another staffer from The New York Times has been swept into a viral controversy after old tweets featuring racial and homophobic slurs\u00a0resurfaced.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
