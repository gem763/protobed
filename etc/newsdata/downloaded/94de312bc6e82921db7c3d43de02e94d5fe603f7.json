Photo: Max Faulkner/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n\nA Texas woman who was sentenced to five years in prison for casting an ineligible vote in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 despite claiming that she didn\u2019t realize she was ineligible to vote, and despite the fact that the vote was never counted \u2014 will try to appeal her decision.\n\nCrystal Mason, a 44-year-old mother and breadwinner for a family of \u201cabout 12,\u201d according to HuffPost, will present her case on Tuesday before three Republican judges on the Texas Court of Appeals to argue that she was wrongly convicted and entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn Texas, felons currently serving their sentence are barred from voting. In 2016, Mason was on supervised release for a felony when she headed to the polls. Mason says she had no idea she was ineligible to vote, and when a 16-year-old poll worker couldn\u2019t locate her name on the rolls, she offered Mason a provisional ballot, which are used when a voter\u2019s eligibility must be affirmed before the vote is counted. Mason filled out an affidavit, which was ultimately rejected \u2014 and that should have been that.\n\nProvisional ballots get rejected all the time: HuffPost found that in Mason\u2019s district of Tarrant County, 3,990 of 4,500 people who cast provisional ballots ultimately saw their vote rejected during the 2016 presidential election. What\u2019s unusual is that this case was prosecuted for illegal voting.\n\nMason\u2019s case attracted nationwide attention for its astonishing severity, and was seen by many as a blatant intimidation tactic meant to suppress voters, specifically people of color and those with criminal records. Kim Cole, one of Mason\u2019s lawyers, recently said, \u201cThis has nothing to do with whether or not she was eligible to vote. They don\u2019t want folks who look like Crystal to show up at the polls.\u201d\n\nActual voter fraud is incredibly rare (the Brennan Center found that it\u2019s more likely an American \u201cwill be struck by lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls\u201d), but voter disenfranchisement is virulent enough to sway elections and cast doubt on results. Keeping this distinction muddled is in the interest of anti-democratic institutions, individuals, and political parties.", "description": "Crystal Mason says she didn\u2019t realize she was ineligible to vote, and is seeking a new trial ahead of her notoriously harsh sentence for voting illegally in 2016.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/10/9-crytal-mason.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
