Then head of Adani Renewables, Jennifer Purdie, gave a target of a potential 1500 MW of renewable energy generation for Adani in Australia by 2022.\n\nBut Mr Dow said that \"things have moved on a bit from there\", citing the volume of investment in renewables that had been made across the sector.\n\n\"That is going to take a little while to shake itself out in terms of understanding how it fits into the overall dynamics of the grid,\" he said, pointing to concerns around grid stability and security in the southern states, particularly over summer.\n\nInvestment caution\n\nAdani is one of the renewables investors hit by transmission losses on the grid, which have reduced returns to many projects. It has been pushing for changes in the rules, describing existing rules for calculating transmission losses as \"outdated and not fit for purpose\".\n\nMr Dow said Adani \"will take a more opportunistic approach\" to future investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We have a number of hybrid projects within the renewables portfolio so the pumped storage, those sorts of options, we wouldn't put a line through any of those; it's a case of looking to opportunity,\" he said.\n\nMr Dow said it came down to customer demand, adequate infrastructure and an appropriate regulatory regime to be able to underpin the stability of a long-term investment in energy supply.\n\nAdani is still in negotiations with potential customers at the proposed 130 MW Whyalla solar farm, where a target for inking a power sales contract by mid-2018 and starting construction by this year has been missed. Alinta is buying 80 per cent of the output of the Rugby Run project.\n\n\"There has been a bit of uncertainty in the renewables sector of late and once more clarity emerges there as well it will be easier to progress these projects,\" he said.", "description": "The Indian energy producer is still seeking to get its second solar project off the ground after finally ramping up the Rugby Run solar farm in Queensland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_191/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1983517ce1b8a8bfcfc72914d8ea1c85ecce4259", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
