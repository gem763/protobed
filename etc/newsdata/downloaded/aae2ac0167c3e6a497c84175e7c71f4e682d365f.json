With this research, it is my hope they will attain a greater respect for the discipline.\n\nScientists, even religious ones, rarely spend time analyzing religious creation myths. After all, when taken literally, these stories are usually in direct conflict with what we know about Earth\u2019s natural history. When faith requires people to cling to those myths anyway, science is cast aside. One would be hard-pressed to think of a scriptural story more at odds with physical evidence than the Garden of Eden.\n\nDespite this, or perhaps because of it, a leading public scholar \u2014 Joshua Swamidass, a physician and genome scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri \u2014 is making a bold new attempt to reconcile the biblical story of Adam and Eve with what we know about the genetic ancestry of the human race. His \u201cgenealogical hypothesis\u201d arrives at a time of great cultural upheaval when facts are malleable, politics perverts science, and the gulf that divides our red and blue tribes is reminiscent of another biblical myth: the parting of the Red Sea.\n\nWhat we already know\n\nThe scriptural challenge is that Adam and Eve are purported to be the ancestors of everyone \u201cto all the ends of the earth,\u201d by the year 1 BCE. But we know with as much certainty as scientifically possible that our species does not descend from a single couple and instead has its origin in Africa around 300,000 years ago. We have evolved through a long line of ancestry that connects with all other living things going back nearly 4 billion years.\n\nSo there\u2019s that.\n\nAnd yet, in his upcoming book, \"The Genealogical Adam & Eve,\" Swamidass makes an audacious claim: A de novo-created Adam and Eve could very well be universal human ancestors who lived in the Middle East in the last 6,000-10,000 years. This is not the first attempt to reconcile the Garden of Eden story with science, but rarely does someone with Swamidass\u2019 credentials do what most scientists would deem unthinkable: Take the story seriously. However, some atheist scientists are taking Swamidass seriously.\n\nSwamidass is not peddling pseudoscience. Indeed, earlier this year, he and I teamed up on the pages of Science to rebut claims by evolution critics. In addition, \"The Genealogical Adam and Eve\" went through a rigorous process of open peer review, involving scholars from many diverse disciplines and even some secular scientists, including myself and Alan Templeton, a giant in the field of human population genetics. Invited to find fault in his analysis, we couldn\u2019t, partly because the hypothesis is so narrow, but also because it appears to be correct.\n\nA dangerous game: Trump administration's 'scientific oppression' threatens US safety and innovation\n\nSurprising though it seems, it is scientifically tenable that, among our billions of other ancestors, we could all be descendant from a single human couple who lived in the past 10,000 years. In fact, as Swamidass carefully explains, this is almost certainly the case according to current estimates of the so-called identical ancestors point, a time in the past when all family trees converge into one common pool of universal ancestors. There are two clear reasons why this astonishing hypothesis is compatible with science.\n\nBronze panel of the first page of Genesis from the Gutenberg Bible on the exterior of the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE)\n\nFirst, Swamidass acknowledges the undeniable scientific truth that the human population evolved from ancestor ape species and shares common descent with all living things. He is a defender of, not a dissenter from, modern evolutionary theory. Second, according to Swamidass, Adam and Eve could have been a special creation whose progeny slowly interbred with the human population that already existed outside the Garden of Eden \u2014 people who had descended through the normal evolutionary process. Some scholars have claimed that the Bible itself hints at the existence of these people when it speaks of the \u201cNephilim.\u201d As interbreeding between the Nephilim and the offspring of Adam and Even continued, the \u201cseed of Adam\u201d could easily spread to all of humanity over thousands of years, and this universal ancestry would leave no genetic footprints.\n\nTherefore, as long as one reads the book of Genesis in a way that allows that the evolutionary tree of life existed alongside the Garden of Eden, and that humans derive their ancestry from both sources, modern science might actually be silent on the issue of Adam and Eve. The effect of this new realization is that Christians, Jews and Muslims can effectively move the Adam and Eve story from the column of miracles that science has soundly disproved \u2014 such as a recent global flood \u2014 to the column of miracles that science cannot disprove, like the virgin birth of Jesus.\n\nPossibility, not proof\n\nTo be clear, Swamidass\u2019 theory does not prove anything about the Adam and Eve story. It doesn\u2019t even offer positive evidence for it, but that is not the goal. Instead, he provides a bridge for those whose faith insists on the real existence of Adam and Eve. Until now, they have had little choice but to reject evolutionary science, at least partly but often wholly. Classes are taught in some evangelical churches that discount evolutionary science in its entirety, a troublesome prospect, being that 1 in 4 Americans identify as evangelical Christians. But if Adam and Eve could exist within the natural world, we might have a resolution to one of the greatest cultural conflicts of the past two centuries.\n\nTempest in a Tardigrade cup: 'Water bears on the moon' don't contaminate space\n\nThis will not tempt someone like me to believe in the creation story laid out in Genesis. But it just might allow those who do believe to be more open to evolution and, god willing, to science more broadly. For those who take the Adam and Eve story literally, the value of this effort is obvious. But there is value for nonbelievers as well. Widespread suspicion of science weakens our social fabric and undermines the common good. From the urgency of climate change and medical research, to the frontiers of artificial intelligence and space exploration, scientific discovery holds tremendous potential for the betterment of human lives. As such, efforts to bring more people into the scientific mainstream serve not one political party or one particular faith \u2014 but all of humanity, to the ends of the Earth.\n\nNathan H.
