Over 1.7 million new permits were issued last year \u2014 a 15.4 percent increase over 2013, the largest such single-year jump ever, according to the report from the center led by President John R. Lott and research director John E. Whitley.\n\nThe number of concealed carriers is likely even higher, since permits are not required in eight states.\n\nGun rights advocates say that the findings in the report fall in line with their personal experiences and research and directly refute the liberal argument that more guns lead to more violence.\n\n\u201cIt puts the lie to the myth promulgated by anti-gun individuals that somehow more law-abiding citizens carrying guns will lead to more crime. In fact, quite the opposite is the case,\u201d said Larry Keene, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation. \u201cMore law-abiding citizens own firearms for self-protection, and crime continues to decline.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 handguns in the U.S.\n\nBut gun control advocates denounced the report, pointing to other studies showing concealed handguns are more frequently used for non-self-defense killings.\n\n\u201cConcealed carry killers are a threat to public safety. The evidence is clear that all too often, private citizens use their concealed handguns to take lives, not to save them,\u201d a statement from the Violence Policy Center\u2019s Concealed Carry Killers page reads.\n\nA spokesperson for the center did not reply to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAccording to the center, there have been 561 incidents in 36 states and the District of Columbia involving concealed handguns that have resulted in 743 deaths. \u201cOnly a tiny fraction of these cases are ever ruled to be in self-defense,\u201d the website states.\n\nBut according to the latest report, concealed carriers are among the most law-abiding citizens in the country, even more so than police officers.\n\nIn Florida and Texas permit holders are convicted of misdemeanors of felonies at one-sixth the rate that police officers are convicted, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe citizen concealed carrier I don\u2019t think ever forgets the fact that he\u2019s a citizen on display, and he knows that he\u2019s representative of a group of people,\u201d said Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America. \u201cThe last thing a concealed carrier wants to do is get into a situation where they have to use the gun. Even if it were a legitimate use, they know just what kind of horrible mess their life will become once they use that gun.\u201d\n\nData on gun sales and recent opinion polls indicate that more people are warming up to the idea of gun ownership. A 2000 Gallup Poll found that 35 percent of Americans thought that owning a gun made their home safer. By 2014 that number soared to 63 percent.\n\nA Dec. 2014 Pew Research poll found, for the first time in more than two decades, there was more support for gun rights than gun control, with 52 percent of respondents saying it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns, while 46 percent said it was more important to control gun ownership.\n\nNCIS background checks increased from 11.2 million to 21 million between 2007 and 2014, according to the report, and the sale of guns has skyrocketed over the last two years. About 14 million guns were sold between 2008 and 2011, while over 20 million were sold between 2012 and 2013, and about a quarter were sold to first-time buyers, Mr. Keene said.\n\n\u201cThe public increasingly understands that gun control is a failed social experiment, and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Keene said. \u201cAll gun control ever does is infringe upon the rights of the law-abiding citizens and does nothing to stop criminals from illegally acquiring firearms, and it doesn\u2019t stop them from misusing them in crime.\u201d\n\nResearchers attributed the uptick in permits and gun sales to President Obama\u2019s election.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2007 the number of permits increased by about 240,000 per year. But in the next four years, during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term in the White House, the number of new permits issued jumped to 850,000 per year. From 2011 to 2013, the number increased by 1.5 million, rising to 1.7 million last year, according to the report.\n\nFollowing the killings of nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, last month, Mr. Obama called for more gun control, a move that Mr. Keene said prompts Americans to head to local gun retailers.\n\n\u201cWhenever we see calls by politicians to take away the ability to exercise a fundamental civil liberty protected by the Second Amendment, people react,\u201d Mr. Keene said.\n\nMr. Pratt also speculated that the spike in permit and gun sales can be attributed to a reaction to riots and looting that occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore during protests over police killings of unarmed black men.\n\n\u201cWhat this really is is a reaction to Ferguson and Baltimore. Every time the authorities demonstrate that things can happen that they can\u2019t control, that your life could be in danger and your property could be taken away from you in an instant, people get it,\u201d Mr. Pratt said.\n\nThe report found that women and minority populations are getting more permits than white men, the most commonly stereotyped gun owners.\n\nSince 2007 permits for women have increased by 270 percent and for men by 156 percent.\n\nAlthough white males are still the largest concealed carry permit-holding group, the number of permits obtained by blacks accelerated the most, with Asians and American Indians following in second.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014 the number of black permit holders increased from 10,389 to 17,594, according to the report.\n\nBlack females were the fastest-growing concealed handgun permit group, increasing 3.44 times faster than white females.\n\n\u201cThe stereotype of the gun owner being a middle-aged male white guy from the South is simply not correct anymore,\u201d Mr. Keene said.\n\nGun rights advocates say that the uptick can be attributed to more minority populations and women in urban areas seeking to protect themselves from violent criminals.\n\nMr. Pratt called the findings very encouraging for conservatives, and said they indicated a shift from liberal ideologies among minority groups.\n\n\u201cThat is probably one of the most encouraging findings in that whole survey,\u201d he said of the data on black permit holders. \u201cThat ought to give liberals and anti-Second Amendment folks a lot of reason to cry.\n\n\u201cI would go and have a sign out for carry permits in the middle of as many black communities as I could. This is going to be a very worrisome finding for the liberals. They ain\u2019t got nothing if they haven\u2019t got the blacks. They lose. That\u2019s the only margin of victory they reliably have,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
