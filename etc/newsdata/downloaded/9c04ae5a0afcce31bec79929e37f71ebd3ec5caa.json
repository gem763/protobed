We socialists want socialism, and we\u2019re not keeping quiet until we get it. Ocasio-Cortez seems to be telling us that Sanders and his movement will still be with us when he\u2019s gone\u2014and that she aims to be the one who leads it\u2026\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders want big tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, single-payer health insurance, free public college, easier union organizing and tougher trade deals. Both have eschewed hitting the large donor circuit, stress that their agendas are designed to empower the poor and working class, and threaten the power of consolidated wealth. Both have scoffed at bipartisan incrementalism.\n\nHowever, if you are a committed socialist, the differences between Sanders and Warren are crucial. Nathan Robinson of the influential socialist magazine Current Affairs last month detailed his problems with Warren. Some were rooted in tactical concerns that she wouldn\u2019t build a political operation to overwhelm the ruling class, as she\u2019s a \u201claw professor\u201d and not a \u201cmovement-builder.\u201d But at bottom, Robinson wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t like to say that I can\u2019t trust Elizabeth Warren, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He pointed to this year\u2019s State of the Union address: \u201cDonald Trump promised that America would \u2018never be a socialist country.\u2019 Warren stood up and applauded, as Bernie sat and fumed. This was a very clear \u2018Which side are you on?\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\nAt a similar moment, Ocasio-Cortez has chosen to remind everyone of which side she\u2019s on.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bill Scher", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
