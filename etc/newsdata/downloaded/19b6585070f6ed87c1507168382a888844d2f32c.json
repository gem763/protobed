But it\u2019s also kind of tricky to dress for.\n\nYou need outerwear, certainly, but anything too thick and bulky will leave little ones feeling cumbersome and too hot by far.\n\nA good jacket is what everyone needs for this transitional time when we are waving goodbye to summer but still waiting for winter\u2019s chill.\n\nIn this roundup we have selected pieces which are light, easy to move in and offer less intense insulation than a winter coat should.\n\nWe have included gilets, rain macs and bomber jackets among others. In almost every instance we have considered the ease with which the jacket might be layered up from beneath with polo necks or thicker jumpers.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

You don\u2019t need to because that is exactly what this mustard polka dot beauty is. The fleece lining is not only on the arms, cuffs and body, but also inside the hood and the pockets.\n\nThe whole garment screams cosy, which is genuinely what our three-year-old tester did when she put it on for the first time. It fits beautifully but with room for layering underneath. Pair with jeans and little leather boots and you\u2019ve got one heck of an autumn vibe.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoJo Maman Bebe printed fleece-lined fisherman\u2019s jacket: \u00a342, JoJo Maman Bebe\n\nHave you ever seen anything more joyful than this rainbow print fisherman\u2019s jacket? There\u2019s something especially cheering about bright colours on clothes which are designed for rain. Made from polyester but with a PU coating, the texture is really rubbery and soft \u2013 it feels lovely.\n\nThis is weightier than a standard raincoat because of the plush fleece lining. It is completely waterproof, with firmly reinforced seams and Velcro flaps to add extra insulation. It is also machine washable \u2013 which is music to our ears.\n\nBuy now\n\nMy 1st Years raincoat: \u00a335, My 1st Years\n\nThere are few things cuter than an infant in a bright yellow raincoat. This version can be personalised with your little one\u2019s name on the left breast panel \u2013 which will ensure it never gets lost. The material is tactile and robust while managing to be lightweight. With a roomy hood, this is wind and rain proof.\n\nThis coat was true to size, but given it is unlined, we advise going up a size so that it can be worn with a thick woolly jumper underneath if necessary. Available for children aged six months to four years \u2013 and also in a navy blue for a subtler look.\n\nBuy now\n\nHunter original little kids lightweight rubberised jacket: \u00a375, Hunter\n\nThis offering from Hunter comes in a range of colours but we plumped for the red \u2013 a bright, jolly statement. It is totally waterproof, thanks to neatly welded seams and a roomy hood.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not heavy or cumbersome and there are plenty of ventilation holes to keep little ones from getting clammy. This is a really well-made piece \u2013 one that will go the distance and no doubt serve as a hand-me-down a couple of times over.\n\nBuy now\n\nFrugi explorer gilet: \u00a335, Frugi\n\nWarm body, free arms: It\u2019s no wonder gilets are such a hit with energetic youngsters. This natty little number is bright, cosy, organic \u2013 and best of all, reversible. We found this true to size and a brilliant choice of outerwear for autumn \u2013 keeping the chill out without feeling heavy or hot.\n\nBest of all, it can be layered from beneath with long sleeved tees or jumpers but also, it will serve as extra insulation when winter comes along with inevitable cold snaps. Our three-year-old tester described it as \u201cso squashy\u201d which is a compliment \u2013 no child can get on board with rigid clothes! And she was right, it is soft and squashy. If pink is not your favourite hue, there are other colourways to choose from.\n\nBuy now\n\nGap bomber jacket: \u00a322.48, Gap\n\nLlamas are still having a moment and children are absolutely here for it, so this silky bomber jacket is bang on trend. This is not going to shield little ones from an excess of inclement weather but it is the perfect outerwear for sunny autumn days.\n\nOur four-year-old practically levitated when she saw this \u2013 it fits like a dream and brings some sass to any outfit. This is, however for younger children only \u2013 for one to five-year-olds.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoules waterproof coat: From \u00a349.95, Joules\n\nFor children aged between three and 12-years-old, this is really lovely piece.

It fastens with both zip and buttons and there is the option to match with mummy.\n\nThe fabric is both breathable and waterproof thanks to critically taped seams. It is also warm with a polar fleece lining. Our seven-year-old tester said she felt \u201cgrown up\u201d and \u201ccomfy\u201d and we think this just about sums it up.\n\nBuy now\n\nVelveteen varsity jacket: From \u00a3109, Alex & Alexa\n\nYes, this is on the pricier side but would you take a look at how awesome this jacket by Velveteen is?
