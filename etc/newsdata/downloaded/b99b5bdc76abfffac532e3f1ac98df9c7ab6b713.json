But the couple put off downsizing until after retirement\u2026then after their youngest\u2019s wedding\u2026then after a big vacation\u2026then\u2026.\n\nThen John had a stroke. Suddenly Jane faced not just the immediate health crisis, but having to move their entire decades-old household into a one-level apartment within three weeks.\n\nWhy no names on this story? Because it\u2019s so common. \u201cThis happens all the time,\u201d says Aida Middel, co-founder of Maryland\u2019s Potomac Concierge, a company which handles downsizing, moving and organizing.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d echoes Mike Gallagher of Smooth Transitions Denver, a downsizing and relocation firm. \u201cThe number one trick to downsizing is starting before you think you need to.\u201d\n\nHe and others mean months or years in advance, not weeks. This is a task that takes longer than you expect at every turn, but offers benefits to those who persist.\n\nAlso see: These 16 money wasters are why so many Americans can\u2019t save for retirement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for a death, divorce or debt to occur,\u201d advises Kim Lawrence, CEO of Seasoned Life Transitions, which handles downsizing, appraisals and related work in Dallas and its northern suburbs. \u201cTaking action now means more space, more freedom and more money.\u201d\n\n8 reasons to pre-downsize\n\nPre-downsizing pays off for a range of reasons: strategic, physical, emotional and financial. Here are eight of them:\n\n1. Starting early shows you how much you own and hints at how much is ahead. \u201cPeople forget what\u2019s in their homes,\u201d says Melanie Gibbons, co-owner of Cull & Tend, a Washington, D.C., home and move management service. They don\u2019t see what\u2019s hidden, such as under-the-bed boxes, under-the-eaves storage, out-of-season clothing and everything stashed in the attic or cellar.\n\n2. You can avoid working under extreme deadline pressure. My own bugaboo is paper. I\u2019ve got shelves and drawers and boxes of notes, copies, contracts, photos and media. And while entire files can often go into recycling, in other cases every single sheet is a separate decision. (\u201cSome people have to touch each piece of paper because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll miss something,\u201d says Middel. Ahem.)\n\nYou might like: Here\u2019s how retirees should plan for an imminent recession\n\nBy going through my office myself, averaging an hour or two every week, I make my own decisions, save cash that might otherwise go to a home organizer or downsizer and find things I can sell, give away or use meanwhile.\n\n3. You can work on the downsizing while you\u2019re physically up to the job \u2014 which also allows more control. \u201cWe have clients who can\u2019t sort and organize, or reach the top of a closet, or sit down and work for long periods on a project without taking a nap,\u201d says Gallagher. \u201cSome can\u2019t even get to the basement, let alone know what\u2019s down there.\u201d Advice: Start on your home before this happens to you.\n\n4. You can conserve valuables while there\u2019s still time. Family photos or linens in the attic may become infested with moths. In the basement? With mildew. In the garage? With mouse droppings. \u201cIf you want to pass these along or sell them, get to them before they\u2019re ruined,\u201d Middel advises.\n\n5. You\u2019ll pass less burden on to loved ones. The average U.S. home contains more than 300,000 items, says Lawrence. If you become incapacitated or worse before making progress on all that, where will this leave your spouse or partner and children, if you have them? Most of Lawrence\u2019s client homes take at least three to four weeks of six-to-eight-hour days for full emptying and disposal.\n\n6. You\u2019ll have time for necessary conversations. Ones like deciding whether those heirloom holiday ornaments should go to your daughter in Vermont. Or will you keep, auction, consign or donate them? Multiply that conversation times any number of other treasures, says Gibbons.\n\nSome conversations that should happen, experts say: The kids/our siblings finally need to get their belongings out of our storeroom. Mom\u2019s china/Hummels/antiques are not going to fund our retirement; now what? What people, groups or museums would be interested in these yearbooks, photographs or collections? Are there ways to recycle mattresses, appliances and medical equipment?\n\nDon\u2019t forget to account for conversations with yourself. \u201cPeople tend to get emotionally attached to belongings,\u201d says Middel. That adds to the time, whether it\u2019s a DIY project or a pay-someone project.\n\n7. You save money\u2014 Gallagher notes: \u201cBy doing this early, you can hold a garage sale rather than pay companies to come out and make a lot of stuff go away. People in my industry charge $50 to $100 an hour.\u201d He cites a four-bedroom house with a basement where clean-out, trash removal, donation disposal and the like came to $15,000.\n\nYou pay a premium for those junk-hauling companies, which can charge more than $1,000 to fill a dumpster. Tackling a room at a time yourself \u2014 taking big items to the dump; tagging furniture to donate and clothes to consign \u2014 spares your wallet and frees up space so you feel great about continuing.\n\n8. You may even like the results so much, you\u2019ll stay longer to enjoy them before moving. Decluttering breathes life into your home, says Gibbons. Her clients often say, \u201cWe should have done this years ago!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust having a clutter-free, organized home is a lot less stress for people,\u201d Lawrence points out. \u201cAs long as they have the discipline not to fill it up again, when they do eventually move on, whatever\u2019s left behind will be much easier for them or their loved ones to deal with.\u201d\n\nA right age to downsize?\n\nIs there a right age to downsize? It\u2019s never too early to start, experts agree. But there is a wrong age, and that\u2019s when you\u2019re too frail, too unwell or too overwhelmed to do the job adequately.\n\nNext up: He moved to America at 20 with just $400, and retired at 53 to sail the world \u2014 here\u2019s how he did it\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cin 40 years, maybe downsizing won\u2019t be such an issue,\u201d Gallagher muses. Kids today are buying from Goodwill and practicing minimalism.
