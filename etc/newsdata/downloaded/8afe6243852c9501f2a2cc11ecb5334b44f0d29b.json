He said the prisoners are like \u201cbombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not know when they will explode. However, this is no longer our responsibility.\n\n\u201cWe are currently subject to a genocidal attack. There is a project to make a demographic change and eradicate Kurds. Therefore, our first duty is the protection of our people, border and soil,\u201d he added.\n\nTurkish forces began the incursion into Syria on Wednesday after the Trump administration agreed not to block the fighting and to withdraw U.S. forces from the war-scarred nation. U.S. President Donald Trump drew widespread criticism for the move from lawmakers in both major parties. They argue the United States is abandoning Kurdish forces who helped the U.S. military defeat the Islamic State terror group there.\n\nTurkey considers the People\u2019s Protection Units, known by the acronym YPG, to be terrorists. The YPG, which is considered an arm of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, is one of the main groups in the SDF, an alliance of fighters who oppose the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe Kurds\u2019 announcement came one day after the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that Turkish forces fired on U.S. troops stationed in Syria, though military sources differ on whether the action was intentional.\n\n\u201cU.S. troops in the vicinity of Kobani came under artillery fire from Turkish positions at approximately 9 p.m. local Oct. 11,\u201d Navy Capt. Brook DeWalt, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement late Friday. \u201cThe explosion occurred within a few hundred meters of a location outside the Security Mechanism zone and in an area known by the Turks to have U.S. forces present.\u201d\n\nWith all U.S. troops accounted for, no injuries have been reported, and \u201cU.S. forces have not withdrawn from Kobani,\u201d DeWalt said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThe United States remains opposed to the Turkish military move into Syria and especially objects to Turkish operations outside the Security Mechanism and in areas where the Turks know U.S. forces are present,\u201d he added. \u201cThe U.S. demands that Turkey avoid actions that could result in immediate defensive action.\u201d\n\nNewsweek reported the Turkish attack was apparently by mistake.\n\n\u201cTurkish border outpost south of Surac came under Dochka and mortar fire from the hills located approximately 1,000 meters southwest of a U.S. observation post,\u201d the Turkish Defense Ministry told Newsweek. \u201cIn self-defense, reciprocal fire was opened on the terrorist positions of the attack. Turkey did not open fire at the U.S. observation post in any way.\n\n\u201cAll precautions were taken prior to opening fire in order to prevent any harm to the U.S. base. As a precaution, we ceased fire upon receiving information from the U.S. We firmly reject the claim that U.S. or Coalition forces were fired upon.\u201d\n\nTurkish forces were conducting Operation Peace Spring against Kurdish fighters when Special Forces came under artillery fire, Newsweek first reported. Special Forces withdrew after the shelling instead of returning fire.\n\nU.S. officials are divided as to whether the attack was a targeting mistake or Turkish military was attempting to pressure U.S. forces to leave the area , CNN reported.\n\nBrett McGurk, former presidential envoy to the global coalition to counter the Islamic State, tweeted it wasn\u2019t a mistake.\n\n\u201cTurkish forces have fired on a declared U.S. military outpost in northern Syria,\u201d McGurk tweeted Friday. \u201cTurkey knows all of our locations down to the precise grid coordinate as confirmed by\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, \u201conly two hours ago. This was not a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe artillery firing came on the same day Trump gave his administration the authority to begin sanctioning Turkey. No sanctions have been levied.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 Kurdish military officials said Saturday that guarding Islamic State prisoners in Syria is no longer a \u201cpriority\u201d after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
