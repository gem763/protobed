The provision allows certain U.S. nationals with claims to property confiscated by the Cuban government to seek damages from companies operating on that property.\n\nJose Ramon L\u00f3pez Regueiro, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, said American Airlines Inc. and Chile-based Latam Airlines Group SA have benefited from the Cuban airport his father once owned before it was seized by Fidel Castro\u2019s government by using its facilities for cargo and passenger transport, according to the complaint. The airport, now called Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport, is Cuba\u2019s main domestic and international airport, according to the complaint. Mr. Regueiro, who lives in Miami, is seeking monetary damages from the two airline companies. \u201cAmerican Airlines service to Cuba including Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport in Havana is authorized by the U.S. government including the Department of Transportation and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control,\u201d Joshua Freed, a spokesman for American Airlines, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll review this lawsuit in detail and vigorously defend our service to Cuba.\u201d Latam Airlines didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment. Mr. Regueiro\u2019s father purchased the airport, known at the time as the Rancho-Boyeros Airport, from Pan American Airways for $1.5 million in 1952, the complaint said. His father then modernized the airport by extending the runway and building a new terminal, before it was confiscated by the communist government in 1959, according to the complaint. The lawsuit is the latest filed since the Title III provision of the federal law was implemented for the first time in 23 years. Since this May, lawsuits have been filed against several companies including cruise operator Carnival Corp., hotel-search company Trivago NV and French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA.
