REUTERS/Toby Melville.\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union without a divorce agreement would be a disaster and must be ruled out, Europe\u2019s biggest business organisation said on Monday, as EU officials warn this worst-case scenario is increasingly likely.\n\nAfter twice postponing the date of leaving the EU, Britain is now set to exit on Oct. 31, but the country\u2019s parliament and public are deeply divided over the terms of the divorce.\n\n\u201cNo deal is a recipe for disaster and should be definitely ruled out. A disorderly, no deal exit of the UK would be extremely harmful for all sides. It would cause massive damage for citizens and businesses in the UK and on the continent alike,\u201d BusinessEurope Director General Markus Beyrer said.\n\nBusinessEurope is a lobby group that speaks for all sizes of enterprises in 34 European countries, including Britain.\n\n\u201cThe negative consequences would not be limited to the exit date but would drag on, endangering the fruitful and positive future relationship we all aim for,\u201d Beyrer said.", "description": "Britain's exit from the European Union without a divorce agreement would be a disaster and must be ruled out, Europe's biggest business organisation said on Monday, as EU officials warn this worst-case scenario is increasingly likely.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430235892&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0RK", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
