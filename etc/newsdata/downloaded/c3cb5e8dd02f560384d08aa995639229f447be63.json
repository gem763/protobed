McFarland reacted to the Trump administration\u2019s scuttled peace talks with the Taliban by suggesting the United States shouldn\u2019t be concerned with \u201ccivilian deaths\u201d in Afghanistan in the future, calling for a large-scale bombing campaign if any Americans are killed \u201canywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nAsked by Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer to give her take on Trump canceling a planned Camp David meeting with the Taliban just days before the anniversary of 9/11, McFarland first said that it was a \u201cgreat place to announce it\u201d as they were \u201choping they would have a deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now that they don\u2019t have a deal, I think it\u2019s important that they canceled it,\u201d she noted. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the Taliban to think they have the upper hand.\u201d\n\nMcFarland, a former Fox News contributor, went on to say that the Taliban needs to \u201clook at what life is going to be like when America leaves\u201d as there will be no American aid or assistance, adding that they \u201ccan go ahead and kill each other until the end of time.\u201d\n\nAfter further stating that since there was no deal it would have been a \u201ctravesty\u201d to have the meeting at Camp David so close to 9/11, McFarland was asked to respond to Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar\u2019s pointed criticism of the canceled meeting.\n\n\u201cI think she is absolutely wrong,\u201d McFarland said of the Minnesota senator\u2019s complaint that President Trump was treating foreign policy like a \u201cgame show.\u201d\n\nMcFarland then said the administration should tell both Afghanistan\u2019s government and the Taliban that American troops will leave under the condition that \u201cyou don\u2019t kill Americans, you don\u2019t kill Americans in Afghanistan, you don\u2019t kill Americans anywhere in the world and you sure as heck don\u2019t kill Americans in the American homeland.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do, you won\u2019t get another dollar of American aid any place, anytime, anywhere, and secondly, we\u2019ll come back here and we\u2019ll find who helped assist attacks on the American homeland and we will bomb them,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe will bomb the training camps, we will bomb the bases and since you don\u2019t care about civilian deaths, we aren\u2019t going to either.\u201d\n\nMcFarland\u2019s desire to see Afghanistan civilian deaths comes on the heels of Fox News contributor Joey Jones calling for the execution of detainees any time an American soldier is killed overseas.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I would do today, is every time one of our soldiers dies overseas during these talks, I would go down to Guantanamo and I would execute a Taliban captive,\u201d he said during a Fox & Friends appearance on Saturday. \u201cWe have to show them that we\u2019re not just looking for an exit strategy.\u201d", "description": "Another pro-Trump guest said on Sunday that \u201cevery time one of our soldiers dies overseas...
