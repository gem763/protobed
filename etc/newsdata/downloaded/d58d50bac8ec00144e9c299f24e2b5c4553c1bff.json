We want to make sure we don\u2019t leave equipment behind. So I\u2019m not prepared to put a timeline on it, but that\u2019s our general gameplan,\u201d he said.\n\nEsper said he was aware of the reported escapes and execution of some Kurdish allies of the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s a terrible situation. We condemn it. We have condemned it,\u201d he said on CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 these are justice things that we told the Turks would happen and play out. Who\u2019s conducting it, it\u2019s unclear at this point and time. There are Turkish regular forces and there are Turkish proxy forces.\u201d\n\nAfter Turkish forces shelled the Ain Issa area, a riot broke out at the camp among 249 women and 700 children who formerly were part of the \u201ccaliphate,\u201d The Guardian reported.\n\nJelal Ayaf, the co-chair of the camp\u2019s management, said sleeper cells within the civilian section attacked the remaining guards who had not fled.\n\nMustafa Bali, the head spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, tweeted a picture purportedly of IS members fleeing the base, stating \u201calmost all\u201d have escaped.\n\n\u201cIf the world seriously consider [IS] as a threat to their security, which I am 100 percent sure is not the case, there is a great opportunity to prove it. Otherwise, we will face the consequences all together very soon. But this time there may not be someone to do the work for them,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF who have been fighting IS alongside the United States for years in Syria.\n\nAin Issa has served as headquarters for the Kurdish administration and is positioned beside the M4 highway, which is used to transport aid to parts of northeastern Syria.\n\nTrump on Sunday said it was \u201cvery smart\u201d not to be involved in the conflict in Syria, adding that he was working with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and other members of Congress about imposing sanctions on Turkey.\n\n\u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nTrump noted that the \u201cKurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK [Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party] the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday said that the military operation in Syria would continue until the Kurdish forces are driven away from Turkey\u2019s borders.\n\nThe Turkish Ministry of National Defense said the mission has been \u201csuccessful\u201d in securing control of the area 21 miles from the Syrian-Turkey border to the M-4 highway.\n\nIn doing so, it \u201cneutralized\u201d 525 Kurdish forces since fighting began, it said.\n\nSOHR said Monday the civilian death toll continued to rise after Turkish warplanes targeted a humanitarian support convoy that included journalists headed to Al-Hasakah, killing at least 15 people, including nine Kurdish fighters.\n\nThe SDF said in a statement that the convoy was \u201cdirectly and brutally targeted.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent reported 11 civilians were killed and more than 74 injured in Ras al-Ain Serekaniye, just south of the Syrian-Turkey border.\n\n\u201cOur hospital in Tel Tamr has no more capacity for all them and we have sent many other hospitals and we expect that the number of martyrs will be increased,\u201d the humanitarian nonprofit organization said in a statement that accompanied photos of a seemingly packed hospital where people were receiving care in hallways.\n\nOver 200,000 people have been displaced, Kurdish Red Crescent said, which is an over two-fold increase from the 70,000 reported following the first day of fighting.\n\nThe organization said its humanitarian work is in jeopardy as the situation deteriorates. On Sunday, two ambulances were hijacked and their crew members were kidnapped.\n\n\u201cWe do not yet know the fate of the four crew,\u201d it said.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 Syrian government troops were heading to the country\u2019s northern border on Monday to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
