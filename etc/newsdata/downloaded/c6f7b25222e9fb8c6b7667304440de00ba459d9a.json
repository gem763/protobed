They could have been red cards but Artemyev ducked into the tackles both times.\n\nBoth Samoa players were cited and both have subsequently been banned for three games.\n\nAn independent judicial committee released a statement late Friday saying that by a majority decision, Matu\u2019u had been found to have committed an act of foul play that warranted a red card.\n\nThe committee ruled that Matu\u2019u committed a reckless high tackle which made contact with the head of the opposition ball carrier, that \u201cthere was a high degree of danger in the approach to the contact and follow-through,\u201d and that the incident occurred in open space and \u201cthe tackler had clear line of sight of the ball carrier.\u201d\n\nMatu\u2019u was sanctioned for the next three games he was scheduled to play, which excludes the World Cup group game against Scotland because he wouldn\u2019t have been eligible while undergoing concussion protocols.\n\nSo he will miss Samoa\u2019s two other group games and, if the Samoans qualify, the quarterfinals. If Samoa doesn\u2019t reach the knockout rounds, Matu\u2019u will miss his next scheduled game for British-based club London Irish on Oct. 26.\n\nLee-Lo has been suspended for Samoa\u2019s remaining three group-stage games.\n\nSamoa beat Russia 34-9 on Tuesday and next plays Scotland on Monday at Kobe.\n\nOther players have been banned amid World Rugby\u2019s clamp down on dangerous tackles.\n\nAustralia winger Reece Hodge was suspended for three games for making contact with his shoulder to the head or neck of a Fiji player in the Wallabies\u2019 opening game.\n\nU.S. flanker John Quill was suspended for the remainder of the pool stage after admitting to a dangerous tackle that resulted in his red card in the Eagles\u2019 opening loss to England.\n\nQuill flattened England back Owen Farrell with a shoulder charge into his head in the 70th minute for the red card offense on Thursday in Kobe.\n\nAn independent judicial committee ruled the no-arms tackle was \u201creckless rather than deliberate.\u201d\n\nQuill became the first player to be red-carded at this Rugby World Cup, and the first American in tournament history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Samoa has had a second player suspended for a dangerous tackle at the Rugby World Cup, with hooker Motu Matu'u banned for the remainder of the group stage and for the quarterfinals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
