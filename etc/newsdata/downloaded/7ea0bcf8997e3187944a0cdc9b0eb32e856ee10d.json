The other members of the team - James Hall, Joe Fraser and Dom Cunningham - all scored consistently as Great Britain totalled 251.611. They did not seriously threaten to pick up a medal, because bronze medallists Japan were around six-and-a-half marks ahead \u2013 a huge margin in this format.\n\nThe USA\u2019s men, who are never as competitive as their women, finished fourth on 254.578. The event reached a memorable conclusion as China\u2019s Sun Wei fell on the high bar when victory seemed to be within his team\u2019s grasp.\n\nAfterwards, James Hall \u2013 who is the team\u2019s most dependable allrounder and performed on all six pieces of apparatus \u2013 told the BBC that he had never enjoyed a competition so much, despite not picking up a medal.
