Designer Lydia Lav\u00edn, for example, worked with artisans from the Huichol community, an indigenous group from Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, to create gowns adorned with embroidery and beadwork.\n\nLydia Lav\u00edn worked with Huichol artisans to create beaded and embroidered garments.

Embroidered pieces included depictions of the bird of paradise, a flower native to Mexico.\n\nNot only did she seek inspiration from Mexico, but worked with artisans with roots in Venezuela, Columbia, Argentina and Peru. \"I think we take a very contemporary view on the embroidery's traditional heritage,\" Weil said.\n\nWeil works with a team of about 16 people each season, including several local artisans. \"It's very fulfilling to give back to the economy and the local people that work with us,\" she said.\n\nLast month, she showed her collection in Paris for the first time. \"I think we have so many things to give to the rest of the world that have not yet been seen in the high-end world of fashion,\" she said. \"I'm very honored to be one of the people sharing these beautiful techniques.\"\n\n\"In Mexico, indigenous artisans have a long history of collaborating not only with fashion designers but with creators in general,\" said Tanya Melendez-Escalante, the senior curator of education and public programs at the Fashion Institute of Technology's New York museum.\n\nLav\u00edn has worked with 3,000 artisans from 14 Indigenous communities across Mexico since launching her brand in 2004.

In the global situation of the world, Mexico just signed a free trade agreement with North America. Mexicans wanted everything from outside and they forgot about our roots, our heritage. And so we started our brand to be proud of who we are as Mexicans.\"\n\nThe label's spring 2020 collection incorporated Aztec and Mayan prints, with a recurring skull motif as a reference to D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). The show's conclusion, meanwhile, drew on the Aztec ritual Fuego Nuevo (New Fire Ceremony).\n\nAudiences were directed to light candles, while all the artisans and designers who worked on the collection walked the runway to take a bow. \"It was important for all of them to come out, and then light the new fire,\" Covalin said. \"In the ancient ritual, you burn the old things and then you start a small fire, and you share it with all the people.\"\n\nThe conclusion to the Pineda Covalin show drew on the Aztec ritual Fuego Nuevo.
