Riley, better known as DennisASMR on YouTube, produces soothing ASMR videos to help people fall asleep while role-playing as the perfect boyfriend.\n\nIn a story first reported by the New York Times, Riley's videos are part of a growing trend of autonomous sensory meridian response or ASMR videos online, where certain audio-visuals like people speaking softly or someone eating closely to a microphone can cause some people to experience a tingling, static-like sensation on the skin.\n\nNow, a new category of ASMR videos called \u201cASMR Boyfriend Role-Play,\u201d where individuals pretend to be someone\u2019s boyfriend, are becoming popular videos online and are supposed to be relaxing or sleep-inducing. Riley\u2019s videos are an example of the trend.\n\n\u201cA lot of people find it difficult to go to sleep sometimes and so my videos kind of work as a sound machine for the people who struggle with sleeping,\u201d he told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nIn past videos produced in his makeshift studio under his bunk bed, the 17-year-old has sung in whispers to his over half a million subscribers, spoken soft sweet nothings to help people fall asleep and has even role-played as different characters, such as Harry Potter and Spider-Man.\n\nEven though Riley has thousands of views in dozens of his videos, does his method work?\n\nSome experts are warning that this type of role-playing can be problematic.\n\nEven though Riley does have that ASMR-sensory-aspect to his videos, Dr. Caroline Fleck, a clinical psychologist and an adjunct instructor at the Stanford University School of Medicine said that some of his content could be \u201cdistracting\u201d and \u201ccould potentially counter balance\u201d what ASMR is supposed to be for.\n\nDr. Caroline Fleck said, \u201cThere is no data to suggest that what he\u2019s doing is effective in any way and/or conductive to sleep.\u201d\n\nIn one video, some may argue that the teen goes too far, with his role-playing coming off as too intense as he pretends to be a jealous boyfriend.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s perpetuating this message that you need someone to take care of you in order to self-soothe, and that\u2019s not accurate,\u201d said Fleck. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s very problematic, especially if you\u2019re reaching a younger audience who maybe doesn\u2019t have expectations for a relationship or hasn\u2019t had them, the idea that a relationship is defined as somebody stepping in and soothing you and taking care of you.\u201d\n\nOwen Riley\n\nDespite what some experts think, Riley argues that he\u2019s not trying to be unrealistic in his role-play.\n\n\u201cMy videos aren\u2019t saying that every relationship is perfect and I\u2019m not trying to be unrealistic with it,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to take the positive elements from that and put it up there because nobody wants to see a video arguing role-play with your boyfriend, that would be terrible.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s mother, Kathy Riley, who keeps a close eye with everything that her son produces online is aware of what kind of messages can be perceived in videos like his.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe always want him to have integrity with what he does, we always want him to not make his fans feel uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWhile Riley may have his skeptics, he certainly has his fans.\n\nHis mother, who goes through comments from his YouTube audience, is positive about people who turn to her son for help falling asleep, \u201cI go through the comments but for the most part they seem to be a great community.\u201d\n\nOwen said, \u201cIt just seems to me like a lot of fun and if it\u2019s helping people, I think people should not look so deeply and enjoy it for what it is.\u201d", "description": "Seventeen-year-old Owen Dennis Riley produces ASMR videos and role-plays as the perfect boyfriend to help people fall asleep.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/owen-riley-02-ht-jef-191008_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
