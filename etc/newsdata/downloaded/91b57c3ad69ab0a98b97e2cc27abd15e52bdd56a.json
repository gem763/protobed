There were plenty of positives for Khan to take out of their trip to Pretoria.\n\n\u201cWe bowled really well and I felt we were unlucky in both innings with the ball,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThey did apply themselves well and we missed a few chances which could have made a big difference.\n\n\u201cIn the second innings with the ball I felt that we kept them in check quite nicely and I thought that 290 in 70 overs was more than gettable.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we didn\u2019t apply ourselves as well as we should have but we have learnt a lot from that first game going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Knights got their campaign off to a winning start with a victory over the Warriors in Kimberley. The Dolphins will meet the Knights in Bloemfontein and coach Khan feels that conditions will be similar to Centurion.\n\n\u201cThe wicket might be a touch slower but there won\u2019t be a huge difference from this week and we will need to apply ourselves well.\n\n\u201cWe played a few pre-season games against the Knights so we have an idea of who they have in their side and know them fairly well.\n\n\u201cThey are a good team, but every team at franchise level is a good side. We have to make sure that we put together four solid days of cricket,\u201d Khan added.\n\nIt\u2019s a second away game on the trot for the Dolphins and Khan knows that it\u2019s crucial to make sure they get as many points as possible.\n\n\u201cTo get a win away from home is priority number one, but if we can we need to push for maximum points in the first innings and then fight for the result.\u201d\n\nGrant Roelofsen and Eathan Bosch have been left out of the side due to injuries. Roelofsen has not recovered from his concussion while Bosch suffered a back injury and has been given longer to recover.\n\nJason Oakes became the Dolphins' first ever concussion replacement and scored a half century in the second innings in Pretoria and he will keep wicket in the absence of Roelofsen.\n\nThe Dolphins have called up experienced seamer Rob Frylinck, young quick Kerwin Mungroo and spinner Smangaliso Nhlebela for the clash in Bloemfontein starting on Monday.\n\nDolphins Squad\n\nKhaya Zondo (Captain), Rob Frylinck, Jason Oakes, Vaughn van Jaarsveld, Okuhle Cele, Sibz Makhanya, Andile Phehlukwayo, Marques Ackerman, Smangaliso Nhlebela, Prenelan Subrayen, Cody Chetty, Kerwin Mungroo, Daryn Dupavillon.", "description": "The Dolphins are aiming to put in a match-winning performance in their second CSA 4-Day Domestic Series clash of the season against the Knights in Bloemfontein.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4910/80b505b975d44bd0b37b9ddef989c733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
