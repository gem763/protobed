Photo: Swan Gallet/WWD/Shutterstock\n\nTekashi 6ix9ine\u2019s former bodyguard was found guilty on Thursday of kidnapping the \u201cFEFE\u201d rapper last summer.\n\nAnthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison, whom prosecutors said was a Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods member, was tried in a racketeering case alongside another purported Nine Trey member, Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack.\n\nThe Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said Ellison kidnapped and robbed Tekashi, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, in July 2018. Prosecutors also claimed that Mack peddled drugs such as fentanyl and heroin.\n\nMack was found guilty of distributing drugs. Both were convicted of racketeering conspiracy.\n\nEllison was found not guilty of using a firearm during Hernandez\u2019s kidnapping. Mack was found not guilty of a firearms count related to his drug-dealing.\n\nBoth face sentences of up to life in federal lockup.\n\nHernandez was the prosecution\u2019s star witness at the made-for-tabloid trial, and snitched on pretty much everyone during his three days on the stand \u2014 from low-level gang members to Cardi B and Jim Jones.\n\nHis testimony stemmed from a plea deal with prosecutors. He and other associates were busted by the Feds in November on a racketeering rap and, in January, the Brooklyn-born performer pleaded guilty to nine counts in the case. He agreed to cooperate against Nine Trey, which is a Bloods offshoot, in an attempt to secure a more lenient sentence.\n\nHernandez revealed at trial that he decided to cooperate just one day after his arrest. He testified that he bankrolled Nine Trey with his music and, in exchange, got protection and street cred.\n\nHis time on the witness stand was characterized by both bombshell and bizarre moments.\n\nHernandez claimed Cardi B was a member of the Bloods and that Jim Jones was in Nine Trey.\n\nProsecutors played audio from a November 2018 call in which Jim Jones and accused Nine Trey \u201cGodfather\u201d Jamel \u201cMel Murda\u201d Jones complained that Hernandez was publicly dissing gang members.\n\n\u201cNow he gotta get violated,\u201d Jim Jones said in the call, which was recorded via wiretap.\n\n\u201cYeah, super violated. Super duper,\u201d Jamel Jones responded.\n\n\u201cJust tell that n\u2014a that he not a gang member no more. He kicked out the whip. He was never a gang member,\u201d Jim Jones also said.\n\nHernandez also said that rapper Trippie Redd \u2014 who was the object of his diss track, \u201cGUMMO\u201d \u2014 was in another Bloods offshoot, Five Nine Brims.\n\nHe further testified that rival rapper Casanova was in \u201canother\u201d Bloods group and that Chief Keef was in the Black Disciples.\n\nThe repeated dime-dropping earned Hernandez the #Tekashisnitch9 hashtag on Twitter.\n\nHernandez also detailed attacks on Trippie Redd and Chief Keef.\n\nWhile Hernandez and Trippie had shared the same label \u2014 they even recorded a song together that \u201cdid really well\u201d \u2014 jealousy spiraled into an online dispute.\n\nThe result?\n\n\u201cWe attacked him at his hotel,\u201d Hernandez said plainly of the November 2017 melee.\n\nHernandez claimed he and his former manager, Kifano \u201cShotti\u201d Jordan, were in a restaurant when Trippie Redd\u2019s manager called.\n\n\u201cTrippie Redd\u2019s manager said that he wanted to squash the beef \u2026 the online verbal attacks,\u201d Hernandez testified. \u201cAt the time I was upset with him, I was like, \u2018Naw, I don\u2019t want to squash the beef.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If you change your mind, here is the address of the video shoot. If you have time, stop by, we\u2019ll take a picture and let the world know you\u2019re friends again.\u2019\u201d\n\nHernandez and Jordan went to Red Hook, where the video shoot was taking place.\n\nThey saw Trippie Redd\u2019s \u201csprinter van\u201d \u2014 a sizeable vehicle that can transport more than 12 people \u2014 and waited.\n\n\u201cWe camped out,\u201d Hernandez explained, matter-of-factly. \u201cWe surveillanced it.\u201d\n\nAfter Trippie Redd left the shoot, he got into the sprinter.\n\n\u201cWe followed him for about an hour and a half, two hours, on the highway,\u201d Hernandez recalled. \u201cWe\u2019re, like, cutting between lanes.\u201d\n\nThe van ultimately arrived at the Gansevoort Hotel. Ellison also rolled up, parking parallel to the Meatpacking District building.\n\nEllison, Kifano, and some others in their clique walked into the Gansevoort.\n\n\u201cShotti comes out screaming, \u2018It\u2019s fucking TreyWey. It\u2019s the fucking mob! We got that n\u2014a!\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cHe said that Harv punched Trippie Redd in the mouth.\u201d\n\nWith Chief Keef, Hernandez recalled how their rivalry hit a breaking point in mid-2018, with a shooting outside a Times Square hotel. Hernandez claimed he asked his pal Kooda to fire at Keef in exchange for $20,000.\n\nHernandez and Kooda met up after the incident on June 2 last year. Hernandez told jurors that he only wound up paying $10,000 because Kooda shot into the air.\n\nHernandez went on to recount his claimed July 22, 2018 kidnapping by Ellison, who was his muscle before the two had a falling out..\n\nHe and his driver-turned-cooperating witness, Jorge Rivera, were driving to an associate\u2019s home in Brooklyn when a car hit them from behind.\n\nRivera got out to take a look.\n\n\u201cI see a guy running up to the passenger side with a gun,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDamn, they caught me. It\u2019s over,\u201d Hernandez remembered thinking. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hit the lock to the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe opens the door and has the gun pointed at me,\u201d Hernandez claimed, identifying this man as \u201cSha.\u201d Ellison was also standing there with a gun, Hernandez alleged.\n\n\u201cThey told me to get into the car before they shoot me,\u201d Hernandez continued.\n\nHernandez did as told and his alleged captors sped off.\n\nThey stopped at one point. Sha dragged Hernandez out.\n\n\u201cSha had me pinned down by the hair,\u201d Hernandez claimed. \u201cHe just kept hitting me on my face.\u201d\n\nSha and Ellison told him to say \u201cnot Billy\u201d \u2014 a way to state he wasn\u2019t in Nine Trey.\n\n\u201cI said it three times,\u201d Hernandez testified.\n\nDespite complying, Sha kept saying, \u2018We should do this n\u2014a,\u2019\u201d Hernandez claimed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ellison allegedly responded. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever gonna know, this is a stolie anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cA stolen vehicle,\u201d Hernandez subsequently explained of the word \u201cstolie.\u201d\n\nEllison allegedly asked Hernandez, \u201c\u2018Yo, what you got?\u201d\n\nHernandez said he didn\u2019t have any jewelry with him.\n\n\u201cWe came to an agreement, if I gave [them] jewelry, they would let me go.\u201d\n\nHernandez called his daughter\u2019s mother, who was at his house. He told her to bring his jewelry downstairs, where Sha met her.\n\nThe booty included a spinning 69 chain, four \u201cfully diamond\u201d rings, a Presidential Rolex, a Cuban bracelet, and a My Little Pony chain. (The pony\u2019s mane was made with Hernandez\u2019s own Technicolor hair.)\n\nThey drove away. Hernandez wound up bolting from their car.\n\nHe slipped into the back of a passing stranger\u2019s vehicle, eventually winding up at a Long Island hospital.\n\nJurors in the case also got to hear a sampling of Hernandez\u2019s profanity-filled songs, with prosecutors playing excerpts from the \u201cKOODA\u201d and \u201cGUMMO\u201d music videos.\n\nThey were also given transcripts of \u201cGummo\u2019s\u201d lyrics, such as the lines \u201cN\u2014s iffy, uh, blicky got the stiffy, uh. Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh,\u201d as well as \u201cIn the hood with them Billy n\u2014s, and them Hoover n\u2014s.\u201d\n\nHe identified purported Nine Trey members who appeared in these clips.\n\nWhen Hernandez heard his music, he gently nodded with the beat.\n\nEllison is scheduled to be sentenced on February 26, and Mack om February 9.\n\nOne of Ellison\u2019s lawyers, Devereaux Cannick, said his client was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by the verdict and that they\u2019re considering an appeal.\n\nHe also said he was \u201ca bit confused, in that if you believe he was kidnapped, then you should have believed there was a gun. But there\u2019s no conviction there was a gun.\u201d\n\nOne of Mack\u2019s lawyers also expressed disappointment, saying he is \u201clooking forward to his appeal.\u201d\n\nAs for what the jury thought of Hernandez and his music, one juror spoke with reporters for a few moments outside the courthouse after the verdict came down.\n\n\u201cI thought he was interesting,\u201d the juror said. \u201cTekashi is Tekashi.\u201d\n\nShe said Hernandez was a believable witness and that his music didn\u2019t come up during deliberations \u201cat all.\u201d His music was \u201cinteresting\u201d but \u201cnot my style,\u201d she also said, saying she prefers Green Day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different, to say the least.\u201d", "description": "Tekashi 6ix9ine\u2019s former bodyguard has been found guilty of kidnapping the \u201cFEFE\u201d rapper last summer.
