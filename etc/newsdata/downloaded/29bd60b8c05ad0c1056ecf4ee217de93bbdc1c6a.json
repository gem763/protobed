The singer shared her first personal photos after news broke this weekend that she ended her month-long romance with Kaitlynn Carter. Cyrus and her husband Liam Hemsworth publicly announced their separation (sources said privately, they had been apart for months before) just as her and Carter's romance began last month.\n\nCyrus posed in the Grand Canyon, and the vibe was I'm on a journey of self-discovery, and I'm going to look very hot during it. There was a chic hair flip shot. \"Extra. \u26f0,\" she captioned it, with respectable self-awareness.\n\nAnd then there was the casual abs pic. \"Consistency \ud83e\udde1,\" Cyrus captioned that Instagram. Her sister Brandi Cyrus knew what she was doing and playfully called her out for it in the comments: \"Uh is this the gun show orrrr???\" she wrote.\n\n\n\nCyrus posted a similar outdoors shot in her first Instagram after her and Hemsworth's separation was announced in August. Cyrus was in Italy on vacation then (with Carter, but she appears alone in her photos), and she was transparent about where she was emotionally in her caption. Cyrus wrote, \"Don\u2019t fight evolution, because you will never win. Like the mountain I am standing on top of , which was once under water, connected with Africa, change is inevitable. The Dolomites were not created over night, it was over millions of years that this magnificent beauty was formed. My dad always told me 'Nature never hurries but it is always on time'.... it fills my heart with peace and hope KNOWING that is true. I was taught to respect the planet and its process and I am committed to doing the same with my own ....\"\n\nCyrus ended her romantic friendship with Carter, by the way, because it was becoming too much, too fast. \u201cMiley doesn\u2019t want a serious relationship,\u201d a source told People. \u201cShe and Kaitlynn spent every day together, and it just wasn\u2019t anything that Miley wanted to continue doing. She wants to focus on her career.\u201d\n\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.\n\nsubscribe here\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It's the climb.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tY28rIbLqNVCKoHK9i51HQ--~B/aD00MDY7dz04MDc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/074588724c7ee8c148a7f978c2486e76", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
