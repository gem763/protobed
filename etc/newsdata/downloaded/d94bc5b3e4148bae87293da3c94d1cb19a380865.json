REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. technology companies including Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) met with U.S. intelligence agencies on Wednesday to discuss security strategies ahead of the November 2020 election.\n\nThe companies\u2019 security teams met representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park.\n\n\u201cThe purpose was to build on previous discussions and further strengthen strategic collaboration regarding the security of the 2020 U.S. state, federal, and presidential elections,\u201d Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, attendees talked about how industry and government could improve how we share information and coordinate our response to better detect and deter threats.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies are under pressure to ramp up security after what U.S. intelligence agencies have called an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation aimed at helping President Donald Trump get elected in 2016. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cThis is a joint effort in response to a shared threat, and we are committed to doing our part,\u201d a Twitter spokeswoman told Reuters in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft and Google also confirmed their attendance at the meeting.\n\n\u201cAt Google, we\u2019ve invested in robust systems to detect phishing and hacking attempts, identify foreign interference on our platforms, and protect campaigns from digital attacks. But technology is only part of the solution,\u201d said Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial that industry, law enforcement and others collaborate to prevent any threats to the integrity of our elections.\u201d", "description": "U.S. technology companies including Facebook Inc , Alphabet's Google , Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc met with U.S. intelligence agencies on Wednesday to discuss security strategies ahead of the November 2020 election.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426337996&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832I3"}
