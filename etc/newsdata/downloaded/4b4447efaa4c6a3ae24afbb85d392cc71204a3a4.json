Kennedy.\n\nThe celebrated singer released a new memoir on Tuesday titled \u201cTouched by the Sun: My Friendship with Jackie, which details the former first lady\u2019s thoughts about both her husbands \u2014 Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis \u2014 as well as her two children.\n\n\u201cI think that some of the things had more effect on her than [his affairs],\u201d Simon, 74, revealed on \u201cToday\u201d about Onassis\u2019 marriage to Kennedy. \u201cFor instance, his not being there for the birth of a child. For his being off with a mistress while she was in the hospital. There are various things that he did that, by comparison, must have hurt more.\u201d\n\nSimon shared the notoriously private Onassis felt completely at ease with her and willingly opened up in unexpected ways.\n\nCARLY SIMON RECALLS SAYING GOODBYE TO JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS ON HER DEATHBED: \u2018IT WAS SURREAL\u2019\n\nCARLY SIMON\u2019S PAL JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS SAID JFK MADE \u2018STUPID MISTAKES,\u2019 ARISTOTLE ONASSIS WAS \u2018VERY SEXY\u2019\n\n\u201c[I was] a free spirit who had the license to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of way,\u201d recalled Simon. \u201cLoose as a goose. I could smoke a joint if I wanted to and she didn\u2019t have the license to be free. She was a naughty girl and she liked that in herself and she liked it in other people.\u201d\n\nSimon admitted that she would never dare bring up Kennedy during their conversations, as she felt it was one topic that was completely off-limits. Still, that didn\u2019t stop Onassis from speaking out about her first marriage, which lasted from 1953 until his assassination in 1963.\n\n\u201cIn a cheerful but resigned way, she told me that of course, she knew about [his affairs],\u201d said Simon. \u201cShe just didn\u2019t mind their presence as much as she might have. Because she knew he loved her much, much more than any of his dalliances.\u201d\n\nWhile Onassis was 16 years older than Simon, it didn\u2019t take long for the matriarch to offer advice on money and love.\n\nCARLY SIMON REVEALS SEAN CONNERY ASKED FOR M\u00c9NAGE-\u00c0-TROIS WITH HER SISTER\n\nCARLY SIMON REVEALS WHO INSPIRED 'YOU'RE SO VAIN'\n\n\u201c[Onassis said], \u2018You\u2019ve got to marry up,\u2019\u201d said Simon. \u201c\u2019You\u2019ve got to find somebody who\u2019s gonna make your lineage stronger, who\u2019s going to give you the best possible children, who\u2019s going to support you, who\u2019s going to have a great position in life in his workplace.\u201d\n\nSimon was previously married to fellow singer/songwriter James Taylor from 1972 until 1983. In 1987, she tied the knot with James Hart. That union lasted until 2007.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she thought marrying an artist was such a good idea,\u201d said Simon. \u201cAnd when I got married to Jim [Hart], my second husband, she at first was not in favor of that because Jim was not a provider in the sense that she thought women should have a provider as their husband.\u201d\n\nAccording to Simon, it was John F. Kennedy Jr. who introduced his mother to her on Martha\u2019s Vineyard back in 1983. The two remained close until Onassis\u2019 death in 1994 at age 64.\n\nLOST MICK JAGGER-CARLY SIMON DUET FOUND AFTER MORE THAN 45 YEARS\n\nCARLY SIMON'S EX-HUSBAND JAMES HART TELLS ALL IN NEW MEMOIR\n\nSimon also vividly recalled seeing Onassis during the final hours of her life in her New York City apartment, surrounded by close friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s seared in my brain what she looked like,\u201d said Simon. \u201cShe was so ravishing, and wearing this little handkerchief scarf, paisley scarf on her head, and looking so beautiful and so regal and so finally at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI held her hand and told her I loved her,\u201d continued Simon. \u201cJohn [Kennedy Jr.] was standing at the end of her bed with his hands neatly folded and [Onassis\u2019 longtime companion] Maurice [Tempelsman] was there with his hands folded and they were both praying over her. The record of the Gregorian chants was playing in the background. And it was just one of those moments that you can\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe I was there \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe that my friend was slipping away.\u201d\n\nOnassis ultimately succumbed to non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nIN MEMOIR, CARLY SIMON REVEALS SHE USED 'SPANISH WITCH DOCTOR' TO HELP SAVE HER MARRIAGE\n\nCARLY SIMON BACK WITH ORIGINAL HIT PRODUCER\n\nNearly 25 years later, Simon was inspired to share the friendship she had with the icon in a book. While she didn\u2019t tell Onassis\u2019 daughter Caroline Kennedy that she was writing the memoir, Simon does hope the 61-year-old will \u201caccept it in the spirit in which it was meant, which was with utter warmth.\u201d\n\nOnassis also got candid about her second husband, Aristotle Onassis, whom she married in 1968 \u2014 five years after Kennedy\u2019s 1963 assassination.\n\nJACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS REGRETTED NAMING JOHN F. KENNEDY JR. AFTER HIS FATHER, CLAIMS PAL\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY JR. SHOULD NOT HAVE FLOWN THE NIGHT HE DIED, SAYS PAL: \u2018THAT IS NOT EASY FOR ME TO SAY\u2019\n\n\u201cShe said he was very sexy \u2014 he would sing to her on his yacht and take her great places to make love,\u201d Simon recalled. \u201cShe knew marrying him was the bad-girl move. In a way, I never knew whether she was sticking up for her own decision or whether she really loved him.\u201d", "description": "Carly Simon was surprised to learn that her pal, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, was willing to open up about some of the heartaches she endured with her first husband, President John F.
