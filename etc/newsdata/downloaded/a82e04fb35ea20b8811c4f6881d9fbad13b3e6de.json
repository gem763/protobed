Japan's Nikkei stock index .N225 closing down 2%, its biggest one-day decline since Aug. 26.\n\nHowever, European stocks eked out small gains after suffering their worst day since last December on Wednesday, when the U.S. got the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods.\n\nWashington will enact 10% tariffs on Airbus (AIR.PA) planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU subsidies to Airbus.\n\nBut a reduction in the initial list propped up some sectors with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index up 0.2%, torn between falls in financials and gains in luxury goods stocks. France's CAC index .FCHI rose 0.7% while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.5%. German bourses - a weather vane for exports - were closed for a national holiday.\n\nThe latest U.S.-European trade tensions added to fears over the standoff between Washington and Beijing, which has cast a shadow over global growth prospects. Earlier in the week, disappointing data on U.S. manufacturing and the jobs market suggested the trade war with China had damaged the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cThe big question for a lot of folks is whether this is the third slowdown since the financial crisis or are we now heading for a global recession,\u201d said Anujeet Sareen, a fixed income portfolio manager and global macro strategist for Brandywine Global. \u201cThe wild card in the pack is always Donald Trump and whatever he tweets next.\u201d\n\nU.S. stock futures ESc1 NQc1 indicated 0.4% higher, after shares fell the most in nearly six weeks on Wednesday. All three major New York share indexes lost more than 1.5%.\n\n\u201cRisk aversion is broadly on the rise and that has been triggered by the weakness in U.S. manufacturing ISM data earlier this week,\u201d said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\n\n\u201cThe outperformance of the U.S. economy compared to other major economies has held the dollar and other risky assets up but that has changed this week.\u201d\n\nThe flight to safety saw yields on two-year U.S. Treasury yields US2YT=RR slip to 1.4680%, nearing a two-year low of 1.4280%. Adding to pressure on yields was a weak U.S. jobs report, boosting expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month.\n\nTraders see a 72.8% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nBets on a rate cut could rise further if a U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday shows weakness in the labor market.\n\nGovernment bond yields in safe-haven Germany DE10YT=RR fell for the first time in over a week.\n\nIn currency markets, the dollar dipped to one-week lows against the euro and yen. The greenback crossed 107 Japanese yen JPY=EBS and touched a week low of 106.95 yen before recovering some ground. It fell to $1.0973 per euro EUR=. The dollar index .DXY slipped 0.1%.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, October 2, 2019.

One senior EU official said it \u201ccan\u2019t fly\u201d because it was an unworkable move backwards that left Britain and the EU far apart.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 was flat at $57.84 per barrel. Energy traders are worried about a slowing global economy, an over-supplied market and geopolitical friction in the Middle East.", "description": "World stocks hovered near four-week lows on Thursday and yields on major benchmark bonds slipped after Washington moved to impose new tariffs on European goods, fuelling fears about global growth and dousing risk appetite.", "authors": ["Karin Strohecker", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436586462&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920O4"}
