Now we know how much, and who incurs this cost -- and it is everybody -- everybody loses.\"In a communique issued on Saturday, the IMF's steering committee said the global economy is projected to grow about 3 percent this year, but the pace has weakened since April.Growth could pick up next year, but the outlook is still uncertain because of some lingering downside risks -- such as trade tensions, policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks.The International Monetary and Financial Committee called for a resolution to trade tensions and a reform for the World Trade Organization.Oh Jung-hee, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
