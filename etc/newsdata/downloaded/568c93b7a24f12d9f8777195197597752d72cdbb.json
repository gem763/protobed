Bush was criticized.\n\n\u201cSides don\u2019t just disagree, they must be disagreeable, and they must stick to script,\u201d said Cavuto on \u201cYour World\u201d on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA liberal must never sit with a conservative, a conservative must never utter a kind word about a liberal. It\u2019s the same reason why a never-Trumper can\u2019t be a now-and-then-Trumper. You\u2019re either all in or just out. Say one thing bad you\u2019re just bad,\u201d Cavuto said.\n\nDegeneres, addressing the fact that the photo prompted many on the left to wonder how she could spend her time in the presence of a conservative Republican, said on her talk show Monday: \u201cPeople were upset, they thought, \u2018What is a gay Hollywood liberal doing sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\n\nELLEN STANDS UP TO TWITTER MOB, DEFENDS APPEARING WITH 'FRIEND' GEORGE W. BUSH\n\n\u201cI\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different.\n\n\u201cWhen I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do, I mean be kind to everyone.\"\n\nCavuto threw his full support behind Degeneres. \u201cThey\u2019re more than what you see or what you think you see or what you know. It\u2019s true, they may sound polarizing but I\u2019m telling you they\u2019re not,\u201d he said of Bush and Degeneres. \u201cNone of us are. Just like none of you are.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to praise his fellow news pundits who may be considered polarizing by some. \u201cSome of you may not want to know Shepard Smith has a big heart and is one of the most kindest and decent people in any profession, but he is,\u201d Cavuto said. \u201cOr that Sean Hannity would give you the shirt off his back if you were down and out whether you were a liberal or a conservative -- but he would.\u201d\n\nHe went on to praise Brian Kilmeade for an \u201caudacious sense of humor and a rapid-fire wit that would put most comics to shame.\u201d He pointed to Steve Doocy\u2019s love for his family, Bret Baier\u2019s devotion to fairness which \u201cborders on an obsession,\u201d Martha MacCallum\u2019s moral compass, and Bill Hemmer\u2019s \u201cinfectious goodwill\u201d towards liberals and conservatives alike.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe then praised news pundits at other cable networks -- such as MSNBC's Rachel Maddow for her kindness to her staff, CNN's Don Lemon for how funny he can be making fun of himself, and fellow CNN host Chris Cuomo for how funny he can be making fun of Lemon.\n\n\u201cLike [Degeneres] said, there is nothing wrong with having conservative and liberal friends. There is everything wrong with thinking there is. Life is too short, but that, my friends, doesn\u2019t mean we have to be,\u201d Cavuto concluded.", "description": "Neil Cavuto lamented the polarization of\u00a0today\u2019s society after a\u00a0photo of daytime talk show host Ellen Degeneres sitting and smiling beside former President George W.
