(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis on Friday accepted the resignation of a New Zealand bishop over what church officials said was his \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d sexual behavior with a young woman.\n\nPalmerston North Bishop Charles Drennan, 59, had offered to resign following an independent investigation into the woman\u2019s complaint, according to a statement from Cardinal John Dew, head of the church in New Zealand.\n\nThe Vatican said Friday that the pope had accepted the resignation.\n\nThe removal is significant since the Catholic Church has long considered sexual relationships between clerics and adult women to be sinful and inappropriate, but not criminal or necessarily worthy of permanent sanction.\n\nHowever, the #MeToo movement and the scandal over ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, an American defrocked by Francis for sexual misconduct, have forced a reckoning about the imbalance of power in relationships between clerics and lay adults, nuns and seminarians _ and whether such relationships can ever be consensual.\n\nDrennan was a member of the New Zealand church team of priests and sisters selected to respond to the country\u2019s Royal Commission inquiry into sexual abuse of children and vulnerable adults in state and faith-based care between 1950-1999. His status on the team wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nDrennan is well under the normal retirement age of 75 for bishops. Ordained a priest in 1996, he worked for seven years in the Vatican\u2019s secretariat of state before being made a bishop in 2011. He took over as the head of the Palmerston North diocese a year later.\n\nMore recently, he was elected secretary of the New Zealand bishops\u2019 conference and was a delegate at a 2015 meeting of the world\u2019s bishops on the family.\n\nDew said the woman made a complaint, and the New Zealand church\u2019s investigative body contracted an outside investigator to evaluate her claim. Both Drennan and the woman participated in the investigation.\n\nDetails of their relationship were not released. The woman asked for information from the complaint to remain private, Dew said. He added, however, that \u201cIn the eyes of the Catholic Church, Bishop Drennan\u2019s behavior was completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nDew praised the woman for coming forward, said she had been told of Drennan\u2019s resignation and is continuing to receive support from the church as well as her family. He urged others to bring reports of clergy misconduct to the church, police or other organizations.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church has no tolerance for any inappropriate behavior by any of its members,\u201d Dew said.", "description": "Pope Francis on Friday accepted the resignation of a New Zealand bishop over what church officials said was his \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d sexual behavior with a young woman.
