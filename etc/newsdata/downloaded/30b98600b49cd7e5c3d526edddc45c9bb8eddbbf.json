After a telephone chat with President Recep Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s Islamist autocrat, President Trump has abruptly reversed U.S. military policy against the advice of the State Department and Pentagon and paved the way for a Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria.\n\nHis stunning decision has not only jeopardized a costly victory over the Islamic State, it has betrayed the Kurds, people who were pivotal in defeating the Islamist militants.\n\nBy now, the Kurds should be accustomed to betrayal. Being double-crossed by Washington has been an enduring feature of U.S. Kurdish relations under Republican and Democratic presidents. But conservatives should be particularly outraged that the latest treachery has been perpetuated by a president who has never stopped crowing about having defeated the Islamic \u201ccaliphate\u201d and having restored U.S. credibility with traditional Mideastern allies.\n\nJACKIE GINGRICH CUSHMAN: WE HAVE FOUGHT MANY WARS AS A COUNTRY BUT NOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN A BATTLE FOR OUR SOUL\n\nTrump\u2019s sudden pivot was too much for at least one of his most vocal supporters: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham condemned the move in an interview with Fox News Monday morning, calling the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria and permit a Turkish invasion a \u201cstain on America's honor\" and \u201cunnerving to its core.\u201d\n\nBravo Sen. Graham. And shame on President Trump. For while Washington has repeatedly abandoned the Kurds for what the French call \u201craison d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d \u2013 or, presumed short-term national security gains -- never has the betrayal felt so naked \u2013 or unwise.\n\nSenior State Department and Pentagon officials had repeatedly urged the president to maintain a small troop presence in northeast Syria to continue operations against the Islamic State and to prevent Russia and Iran, in particular, from strengthening their influence there. That goal, too, is now in clear jeopardy.\n\nThe White House statement issued Sunday night also appears to give Turkey responsibility for some 90,000 IS fighters and supporters captured in the past two years whom the Kurdish forces have been holding in camps across the Syrian province.\n\nBravo Sen. Graham. And shame on President Trump. For while Washington has repeatedly abandoned the Kurds for what the French call \u201craison d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d \u2013 or, presumed short-term national security gains -- never has the betrayal felt so naked \u2013 or unwise.\n\nLike so many of his more erratic moves, President Trump appears to have reversed U.S. foreign policy with scant consultation or warning. The move clearly shocked not only European allies, concerned about the possible return of ISIS fighters to their countries, but the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) without whom the Islamic State in Syria would not have been defeated.\n\nIn a statement, the SDF accused the administration of having betrayed a dependable ally and endangered the defeat of ISIS. The SDF claims to have lost 11,000 fighters, with 24,000 wounded in the campaign to defeat ISIS. The U.S. death toll fighting the Islamic State in Syria was fewer than 10.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision, however, delighted President Erdogan, who considers Kurdish forces in Syria as \u201cterrorists\u201d and seeks to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside this predominantly Kurdish area where it can resettle many of the estimated 3.5 million Syrian and other Sunni Muslim refugees who fled the Syrian civil war, many of whom now live in Turkey. America\u2019s move undoubtedly now leaves the Kurds, who fear being outnumbered in what has been their traditional demographic stronghold, utterly at Turkey\u2019s mercy.\n\nThis is hardly the first time that America has betrayed a commitment to the Kurds. With a population of some 30 million divided over four states\u2014Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria\u2014the Kurds have repeatedly fought and died seeking freedom and nationhood. Each time they came close to achieving their goal, the U.S. or other influential allies have turned on them.\n\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Kurds in modern-day Turkey were promised a referendum on independence. But the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne guaranteed Turkish sovereignty over what they hoped would become independent Kurdistan.\n\nForty years later, Iraqi Kurds, supported by the shah of Iran with the blessing of the U.S., fought two wars against Baghdad during the 1960s and 1970s. But they were betrayed again in 1975 when the shah struck a deal with Saddam Hussein, abandoning the Kurds to their fate. Tens of thousands were slaughtered and displaced by Saddam\u2019s brutal retaliatory campaign against them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIraqi Kurdish hopes for independence were re-ignited yet again after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Though some Kurds yearned for independence, they settled for the creation of a federal region within Iraq and considerable autonomy.\n\nWhen ISIS emerged in the wake of the U.S. invasion and spread like wild-fire across Syria and Iraq, occupying territory the size of Great Britain, Washington again sought Kurdish help. In 2014, Iraqi and Syrian Kurds readily joined the American alliance to fight the group which directly threatened them. Once again, they had hoped that loyal support for America would be rewarded by Washington\u2019s support for Kurdish national objectives. Yet now, once again, Trump has betrayed them.\n\nStung by the unusual bipartisan condemnation of his decision, President Trump tweeted Monday that based on his self-described \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d Turkey understood that he would \u201cdestroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if Ankara did anything \u201coff-limits.\u201d But denigrating as mercenaries the Kurdish fighters who made his proclaimed triumph over ISIS possible, he added that while the Kurds \u201cfought with us,\u201d they were paid \u201cmassive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGiven this reaction and America\u2019s long history of betrayal of the Kurds, why should they, or any U.S. ally, for that matter, depend on Washington to reward support and loyalty?\n\nThis is clearly what infuriated Sen. Graham, R-S.C., who lashed out against Trump in a fierce tweetstorm. Graham warned that his decision \u201cEnsures ISIS comeback\u201d and \u201cForces Kurds to align with [Syria\u2019s President] Assad and Iran.\u201d \u201cThis decision virtually reassures the reemergence of ISIS. So sad. So dangerous,\u201d Graham tweeted. \u201cPresident Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us,\u201d he warned.\n\nSadly, he is right. Who will help us fight ISIS next time?\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUDITH MILLER", "description": "While Washington has repeatedly abandoned the Kurds -- never has the betrayal felt so naked \u2013 or unwise.", "authors": ["Judith Miller", "A Fox News Contributor", "Is An Award-Winning Author", "An Adjunct Fellow At The Manhattan Institute", "A Contributing Editor Of Its Magazine", "City Journal.
