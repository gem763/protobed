Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the first time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nABC News on Thursday revealed the order for the 10 candidates who met the polling and fundraising requirements set by the Democratic National Committee. The lineup was determined by polling averages based on the last 10 polls certified by the DNC.\n\nThe debate will be the first one in which all qualifying candidates will not only appear onstage together, but where Biden will also have to fend off attacks from his two closest competitors.\n\nSanders and Warren will have the opportunity to challenge Biden\u2019s moderate policy positions as the Democratic Party veers more left than it has in past elections. But they will also have to challenge each other as they battle for the progressive vote.\n\nAccording to a new Qunnipiac poll , Warren has jumped ahead of Sanders for second place, pulling in 19 percentage points to his 15. Biden sits at 32 percent support.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Sanders, Biden, Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, businessman Andrew Yang, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nThe debate \u2014 which will be moderated by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Linsey Davis and Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos \u2014 will broadcast on ABC and Univision affiliates across the country on Sept. 12.\n\nCandidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to respond to questions posed to them and 45 seconds for rebuttals. They will also each receive time to issue an opening statement.\n\nTo qualify for the third debate, candidates had to receive at least 2 percent in at least four DNC-approved polls released between June 28 and Aug. 28 and reach 130,000 donors. Nearly half the candidates in the 2020 Democratic field failed to reach both of the new stringent thresholds.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and author Marianne Williamson met only the donor requirements. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania didn\u2019t meet either requirement.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington have dropped out of the race.", "description": "ABC News on Thursday revealed the order for the 10 candidates who met the polling and fundraising requirements.", "authors": ["Evan Semones"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/c2/76375d0e46609819874913fa15bd/septdebatepodium.jpg"}
