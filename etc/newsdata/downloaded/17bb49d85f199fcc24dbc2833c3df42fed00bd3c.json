No Wonder Trump Hates It.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cUkraine, disregarding what Mr. Trump says, it\u2019s a success case for Eastern Europe,\u201d said Gumenyuk. \u201cIf Ukraine succeeds, everybody is watching in the region \u2014 Moldovans, Belarussians, the Caucasus, Central Asia. If this country slides back to old times, or goes in the Russian direction, the region is lost.\u201d\n\nThere was once a bipartisan conviction in Congress that such an outcome would be calamitous. But Trump obviously has no problem with Russia expanding its influence. He has no interest in seeing liberal democracy thrive in Eastern Europe or anywhere else. For liberal Ukrainians, earnestly trying to live up to Western ideals that the world\u2019s most powerful Western country is in the process of abandoning, this new geopolitical situation has been deeply alarming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that our integrity, our image, our hard work that we\u2019ve been carrying out over these years, our fight for freedom, our fight for democracy, is continuously supported by our partners,\u201d said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, Ukraine\u2019s former vice prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told me. \u201cAnd this is the major challenge right now.\u201d\n\nIt almost doesn\u2019t matter, said Gumenyuk, that after freezing military aid to Ukraine, Trump eventually unfroze it. The aid was militarily necessary, but it was also seen as symbolic, \u201cto show Russia that the U.S. is on our side,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now it is clear that Trump is not on the Ukrainians\u2019 side.\u201d The shock of this is something Western-oriented Ukrainians are only beginning to grapple with.\n\nThose who dream of a more open society have no other power to turn to. President Emmanuel Macron of France wants to reach out to Russia to forestall the influence of China. The U.K. is roiled by Brexit. Ukrainian liberals I met with last week kept using the same phrase \u2014 they spoke of being \u201cleft alone\u201d with Russia.", "description": "As America joins the axis of autocrats, Ukrainians fear being left alone to face Russia.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/opinion/14goldbergNew/14goldbergNew-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
