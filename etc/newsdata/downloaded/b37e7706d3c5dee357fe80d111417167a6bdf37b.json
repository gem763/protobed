He described his target voters as \"left behind, ignored ... their towns suffering from lack of love and investment ... their views that have somehow become unfashionable or unmentionable\".\n\nMr Johnson later (early Thursday AEST) requested a prorogation of parliament from October 8 to 14, to allow him to present a new legislative agenda that would form the basis of an election manifesto.\n\nIn his speech he slammed the radical agenda of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, saying the Opposition Leader would \"whack up taxes\", \"foul up the economy\", remove immigration controls and disband the armed forces. \"We cannot allow that to happen.\"\n\nMr Johnson wants an election as soon as possible, to leverage his skills as a campaigner and take advantage of a weak and divided opposition. Labour and the minor parties have refused to vote for one in parliament until Mr Johnson takes an October 31 no-deal Brexit off the table.\n\nBrexit proposal\n\nShortly after Mr Johnson's Europe negotiator David Frost began talks with the European Commission on Wednesday, the British government released a summary of its Brexit offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs leaked to the media the previous night, Northern Ireland would remain in full regulatory alignment with Ireland and the EU, though the regional government could keep this under review and opt to switch to mainland Britain's regulatory regime in future.\n\nBut the province would leave the EU's customs zone, requiring a \"decentralised\" regime of customs checks (at exporters' premises, for example) rather than inspections on the politically charged 500km border with Ireland.\n\nThere would be a standstill two-year transition period - very likely delaying the finalisation of any Australia-Britain free-trade deal - while the details were worked out.\n\n\"If parliament were a reality TV show then the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now.\" \u2014 British PM Boris Johnson\n\nCommentators have said it would be surprising if the EU agreed to the complex and controversial plan.\n\nIf they reject it, Mr Johnson appears to have two clear options. He could break the law passed by MPs that demands he avoid a no-deal Brexit. Or else he could request the legally required three-month Brexit delay, blame it on the anti-Brexit metropolitan elite, and fight an election promising to respect \"the people's will\".\n\nParliament vs the people\n\nMr Johnson used his speech to pit himself against parliament, in effect describing it as broken. \"If parliament were a laptop, then the screen would be showing the pizza wheel of doom,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If parliament were a reality TV show then the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now\" - although he did relish the prospect of interventionist House of Commons Speaker John Bercow being \"forced to eat a kangaroo testicle\".\n\nMr Johnson sought to plant his flag firmly on Labour turf, in a bid to appeal to blue-collar voters who voted 'Leave' in the 2016 referendum and who are frustrated with Mr Corbyn's Brexit equivocation and his liberal attitudes to social policy.\n\nInverting the conventional British political wisdom, he described the Conservatives as \"the party of the National Health Service\".\n\n\"I claim that title because it is our 'one nation' conservatism that has delivered and will deliver the economic growth that makes those investments possible,\" he said.\n\n\"We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services.\"\n\nHe said moving past Brexit would allow him to \"reboot politics\", focus on new economic opportunities and investing in infrastructure and public services - whereas the opposition parties wanted to spend 2020 in the \"chaos and cacophany\" of fighting second referenda on Brexit and Scottish independence.", "description": "British PM doubles down on Brexit poker and echoes Scott Morrison's pitch to \"the forgotten people\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2691%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_109%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4aa4b947381831b8b3f033f70e6a7c775d7d13af", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
