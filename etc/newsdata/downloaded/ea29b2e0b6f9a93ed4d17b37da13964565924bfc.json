Referee: Carlos Del Cerro Grande 7 Attendance: 18,071\n\nShould they miss out on the top two, their second-placed finish in their Nations League group may be enough to secure a play-off in March.\n\nMoore qualifies for Wales through his maternal grandmother \u2013 but was chosen only after a frantic search through the family possessions to locate the relevant birth certificate.\n\nMaking only his second appearance for Wales, and his first in a competitive match, there was little pre-match to suggest Moore would be a threat here \u2013 after all, he has not scored in a senior fixture since joining Wigan from Barnsley in the summer.\n\nBut he gave Slovakia centre-back Gyomber, who once had a spell with Roma, a bruising first half, as allowed his team-mates to use the direct approach and regularly used his height to release Daniel James into space.\n\nIt was James who provided Moore with one of his career highlights. Seconds after Gareth Bale had headed Connor Roberts\u2019 cross against bar, James found space inside the box and lifted the ball back into the centre for Moore, who nodded it back across Martin Dubravka to give Wales the lead.\n\nRyan Giggs experienced a mixture of emotions as his side toiled for a victory in Slovakia\n\nGenerally, Wales were compact, although the Slovakian midfield pair of Marek Hamsik and Stanislav Lobotka posed some difficult questions.\n\nEarly on, with the match goalless, Ethan Ampadu produced a superb block to deny Robert Mak from close range after Tom Lockyer\u2019s had dawdled on the ball, letting in Hamsik and Robert Bozenik.\n\nMak missed another chance as the half edged towards its conclusion, when he shot straight at Wayne Hennessey after being released by Hamsik.\n\nMoments later, Wales thought they should have had a penalty when the impressive Williams fell under a challenge from Norbert Gyomber, but replays showed the centre-back had made faint contact with the ball.\n\nAs dangerous as they looked on the break, the warning signs were there for Wales, especially down the Slovakia right. In stoppage time, Kucka nutmegged Ben Davies but fired wide.\n\nSadly for Wales, he was far more accurate with his next chance. In the 53rd minute, the otherwise excellent Roberts could only head clear as far as the edge of the penalty area, and Kucka sent a ferocious volley past the helpless Hennessey.\n\nNorbert Gyomber was shown a red card for the hosts in the dying moments after a poor tackle\n\nBale was left to dwell on the result as the final whistle sounded inside the City Arena stadium\n\nWith Lobotka increasingly influential, Wales were struggling to regain their composure. The Celta Vigo midfielder started another attack that ended with Roberts produced a fine interception to deny Mak.\n\nWales came again. Bale and Roberts combined down the right and from Roberts\u2019 low cross, Moore found space at the near post to flick the ball goalwards, only for Dubravka to block it.\n\nWith Harry Wilson and Joe Morrell on to replace Williams and Ampadu, Wales again looked dangerous on the break, and came close again in the 77th minute. Joe Rodon was first to James\u2019 free-kick, but the ball was deflected over the top.\n\nGyomber had failed to contain Moore all night and it was no surprise when he received a second yellow for a wild lunge that saw him land on top of the centre-forward. From the free-kick, Rodon\u2019s overhead-kick flew just wide.\n\nThere was still time for another Wales chance deep into stoppage time as Wilson robbed Lobotka and released Moore, but James\u2019 shot was wild after collecting his team-mate\u2019s short pass inside the box.\n\nThe Manchester United forward\u2019s expression at full-time \u2013 covering his face with his hands and looking skywards \u2013 summed up his disappointment.
