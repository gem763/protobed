It is what it is.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals couldn\u2019t be eliminated from the postseason Monday night, but with their ace on the mound and a 2-0 National League Championship Series deficit, this Game 3 was a must-win in every other sense. St. Louis lost to the Nationals, 8-1, putting the Cardinals on the brink of their season ending as soon as Tuesday night, with the next two games of the series to be held in Washington, if a Game 5 is even necessary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJack Flaherty, the NL\u2019s best pitcher in the second half of the regular season with a 0.91 ERA, lasted just four innings after allowing four runs in the third. St. Louis\u2019s offense remains dormant \u2014 the Cardinals have two runs through three games \u2014 offering little hope that will change with Patrick Corbin tabbed as the Nationals\u2019 starter for Tuesday\u2019s Game 4. Washington didn\u2019t turn to either of its top relievers, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson, meaning they\u2019ll both be available as well.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this, and it\u2019s appropriate for the area we\u2019re at: There is no concession speech being written,\u201d St. Louis Manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cThis is a team that can absolutely win four games in a row, and clearly we have to start. . . . This group will bite, scratch and claw. We\u2019re going to figure out a way to win tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBefore Monday\u2019s game, Shildt acknowledged that the Cardinals hadn\u2019t given themselves many offensive opportunities \u2014 they tallied just four hits in the first two games combined \u2014 but \u201cwe\u2019ve pretty much done as much as we can with what we\u2019ve had.\u201d That changed in Game 3. Marcell Ozuna led off the second inning with a double, a nice change of pace for St. Louis after it was hitless through six innings in each of the first two games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez, inserted into the lineup to boost a woeful offense, was at the plate next, and he grounded a ball back to Washington starter Stephen Strasburg, who turned and spied Ozuna too far off second base. The pitcher made the fundamental play taught by Little League coaches and jogged directly at the runner, forcing him to pick a base. Ozuna never did. He stood, rooted to the spot, as Strasburg tagged him out \u2014 a costly mistake for a team desperate for base runners. The Cardinals have earned just three walks off Nationals starters for the series, and they didn\u2019t work Strasburg for a single one Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re throwing it right down the middle. They\u2019re making quality pitches,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cThey\u2019re throwing strikes and then they\u2019re getting us to chase.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. We\u2019ve got to do a better job if we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs frustrating as more offensive ineptitude was for St. Louis, it was the defensive blunders that stung most for a team whose strength is stingy, fundamental play. The Cardinals, who had contained Washington\u2019s offense to five runs through the first two games, then spotted the Nationals four in the third inning alone Monday \u2014 and every run came with two outs. The most damaging of those was Anthony Rendon\u2019s flyball to left that scored Adam Eaton; Ozuna slid to catch it and even briefly had the ball in his glove before it popped out. It was scored as a double rather than an error, and it gave Washington a 2-0 lead that felt insurmountable considering St. Louis had managed just one run for the series to that point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy play any time you have to leave your feet and go a distance and slide,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a play that he\u2019s clearly capable of making, but it\u2019s not a play you absolutely expect somebody to make.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other plays in the game that were a factor that I can\u2019t single that out as being the fulcrum that led to the rest of the game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlaherty then walked Juan Soto, and a wild pitch to start Howie Kendrick\u2019s at-bat advanced Soto and Rendon to second and third. Kendrick\u2019s line-drive double to right scored both, making the Cardinals\u2019 climb to get back in the game that much steeper. It\u2019s now even more so for the series. The 2004 Boston Red Sox are the only team to recover from a 3-0 hole.\n\n\u201cWe know how good we are; we know how good they are,\u201d second baseman Kolten Wong said. \u201cTo come into this situation and be where we\u2019re at, we expected \u00adbetter.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NLCS:\n\nAD", "description": "As frustrating as more offensive ineptitude was for St. Louis, it was the defensive blunders that stung most for a team whose strength is stingy, fundamental play.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J9brj2KuJt73NGYDUvxRqOKjt_c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SLFLDXPAII6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
