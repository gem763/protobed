But as people like YouTuber Rich Rebuilds have shown, one Tesla owner\u2019s loss can easily become another\u2019s gain. Just take the resurrected 1968 Porsche 912 featured in the video above, which is, once again, doing smoky burnouts, thanks to the motor from a Tesla Model S P85.\n\nA few years ago, The Verge traveled to Southern California to talk to a man named David Benardo, whose company, Zelectric Motors, was refurbishing old Volkswagen Beetles and Microbuses and retrofitting them with electric powertrains. Since then, the trend has really started to take off, and Zelectric \u2014 along with its companion performance shop, EV West \u2014 now has a waitist measured in years, full of customers waiting to plunk down up to (and sometimes more than) $100,000 for a car.\n\nPutting EV tech in vintage cars has become so popular that even automakers are doing it\n\nThe idea of mating new EV technology with vintage cars has grown so popular that even the automakers are trying to tap nostalgia to promote their electric road maps. Some have called on classic designs for their future-facing all-electric concept cars. Aston Martin announced that it would convert old cars for owners who wanted to dodge impending pollution rules in major cities. Jaguar made a limited run of electric E-Types, and Prince Harry even drove one to his wedding.\n\nThis boom means Benardo and EV West founder Michael Bream are able to take on more complicated and expensive projects, like the new 1968 Porsche 912. They\u2019ve taken what was once a somewhat rusty shell from an owner in Las Vegas and turned it into a 550-horsepower electric monster with 4,500 pound-feet of torque. Not bad for a car which was less powerful than its predecessor during that era, earning it the moniker of the \u201cbudget\u201d or \u201cpoor man\u2019s\u201d 911.\n\nThe Porsche uses the Tesla\u2019s electric motor, inverter, rear differential, and even the throttle pedal. But it doesn\u2019t use the Model S\u2019s battery. Instead, the little Porsche is powered by a smaller 32kWh pack from LG Chem, which has been split into two 16kWh portions to help balance the weight of the car. Still, Bream says the car gets around 140 miles of range.\n\n\u201c[It was] a little bit of a challenge, engineering-wise, because the car is much smaller than the cars that we\u2019re pulling the components out of. A Tesla drive unit comes out of a 5,500-pound car, and we\u2019re trying to shoehorn into about a 2,300-pound car,\u201d Bream says. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of engineering challenges there.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla-powered 912 will also lay the groundwork for future builds. EV West plans to sell a 912 conversion kit for roughly $50,000 based on the work that\u2019s being done with this project \u2014 meaning people with some knowledge, access to an old 912, and lots of disposable income will be able to skip the waitlist and do the work themselves.\n\nNot everyone loves what people like Bream and Benardo are doing. Leslie Kendall, the chief historian of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, says some vintage car purists aren\u2019t especially fond of the idea. \u201cThey look at it and consider it \u2014 and many have a point \u2014 a desecration of whatever vehicle it is. Because you\u2019re taking a vehicle they\u2019re not making anymore, and you\u2019re turning it into something it\u2019s not and was never meant to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole idea of getting a classic car is getting an authentic motoring experience. And part of that authentic motoring experience is the rev of the engine.\u201d\n\nSome purists consider it a \u201cdesecration\u201d\n\nKendall isn\u2019t a total prescriptivist when it comes to restoring vintage cars, though. \u201cOnce it\u2019s your car, you can do anything you want to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a really rare car, like a Porsche 901, one of the pre-911 Porsches, and you want to convert it to an electric car, it\u2019s yours. You certainly can do that.\u201d But, Kendall says, that would still \u201cdiminish\u201d the hobby by \u201ctaking something very rare, something very important, and modifying it, likely to the state that it would be very difficult to return to its original configuration.\u201d\n\nFor owners like Paul Stone, who bought a converted 1966 Volkswagen Beetle from Zelectric a few years ago, the modernist twist was what sold him.\n\n\u201cI had very low expectations because the electrified VWs I\u2019d see online were just Frankenstein\u2019s monsters,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThey [were] filled with golf cart batteries in the back seat and strange motors. They really were bad, so I assumed it was going to be like that.\u201d But once Stone got behind the wheel, he says he was \u201cblown away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first time I drove it, [I] got out on to the street and really stepped on the accelerator... it was fast and fun,\u201d he says. \u201cIn first gear, it\u2019ll throw you into the backseat.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s encountered some resistance when he\u2019s brought his Beetle to car shows or meet-ups, but he says it\u2019s rare. \u201cPeople who are attracted to the car ... they\u2019re not interested in a large V8 gas-guzzling classic car that\u2019s been restored,\u201d he says. \u201cThis has kind of opened it up to another generation. I think this is going to be the future of car collecting.\u201d\n\nBenardo and Bream say they try to construct the cars so it\u2019s possible to convert them back, though they don\u2019t really expect that to happen.\n\nBut Kendall\u2019s comments illustrate a larger point: of course some of the people who have spent decades, maybe even most of their lives, finding, restoring, collecting, tuning, and showing off vintage cars aren\u2019t going to like what shops like Zelectric and EV West are doing.\n\nThere\u2019s been similar resistance in other places where electric cars are showing up. Formula E, the first global all-electric racing series, has had to work extra hard to prove itself (and spend a lot of money in the process) over its first five seasons. And while EV sales are slowly ticking up around the world, consumers in the US are buying more gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks in the near-term.\n\nThe electric car revolution is not a shift that will happen overnight. But with projects like the Tesla-powered Porsche, shops like EV West and Zelectric Motors are showing that car culture is starting to adapt to this new reality \u2014 and they have the waitlist to prove it.", "description": "The Verge visits with California car shops Zelectric Motors and EV West, which are in the business of turning old Volkswagen Beetles, Microbuses, and Porsches into electric cars.
