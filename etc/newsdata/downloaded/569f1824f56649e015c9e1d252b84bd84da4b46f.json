Each of the two panels in the diptych had four scenes.\n\nOnly two other elements of the diptych are known to exist: \u201cThe Flagellation of Christ\u201d displayed at the Frick in New York, and \u201cThe Virgin and Child with Two Angels\u201d at the National Gallery in London.\n\nCimabue is renowned for his mosaics, frescoes and altarpieces.\n\nHistorians say only about a dozen works on wood \u2014 all unsigned \u2014 are thought to have been made by the Italian artist.\n\nHis more natural and nuanced depictions marked a turning point for Italian painters still influenced by highly stylised Byzantine art.\n\nArt historians consider him a trailblazer for the creative Renaissance that would flourish under greats like Giotto, one of Cimabue\u2019s pupils.", "description": "Senlis (France) (AFP) \u2013 A rare masterpiece by Italian early Renaissance master Cimabue that was discovered in a French kitchen was sold on Sunday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
