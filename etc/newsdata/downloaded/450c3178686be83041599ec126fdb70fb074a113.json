Plus: Wendy Laura Belcher on African literature\n\nAfter nearly three years of intense negotiations, the Brexit talks appeared to break down this week as a \u201cblame game\u201d began over which side was responsible for the failure to agree a deal. Hostile briefings flowed out of Downing Street, enraging EU officials. Both sides now admit an agreement before the European council summit next week is unlikely.\n\nAt the heart of all of this, one issue has remained unresolved: the Irish border. If the UK is determined to leave the EU single market and customs union, how does it comply with the Good Friday agreement and the necessity of an open border with the Republic of Ireland?\n\nJoining Anushka Asthana to discuss it all are the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll.\n\nAlso today: Wendy Laura Belcher, a professor of African literature at Princeton University, says she is often shocked by people who assume her subject is limited and narrow. On the contrary, she argues, African literature is vast and diverse \u2013 and richly rewarding to study.", "description": "Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Rory Carroll tell Anushka Asthana that solving the Irish border problem is still key to a Brexit deal.
