Leave a couple of hours to explore the town - and it's well worth opting for a (free) guided tour to learn all about the rich history.\n\nThe park's museum is also a handy source for learning about the town and the top things not to miss while you're there.\n\nThere is an admission fee - $7 per adult 17 or older (approx \u00a35) and $5 per child 16 and younger (approx \u00a33). You can find out more on the Visit Mammoth website.\n\nThe nearest airport is Mammoth Yosemite Airport although there are no direct flights from the UK, with most routes including a stopover at LAX. You can check Skyscanner for cheap flights.\n\nLooking to stay nearby?
