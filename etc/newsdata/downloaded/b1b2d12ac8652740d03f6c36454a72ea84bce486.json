However, it now seems to have received the necessary green light from President Trump.\n\nThis decision will have a number of serious ramifications on the power balances and security environment in the region, but there is one party that will feel disillusioned and deeply betrayed. The Kurds.\n\nIt is not yet clear what the scale of such a Turkish military incursion will be or how far it would go into the Syrian territory controlled by the Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It is expected to remain within a 100km stretch along the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, after a phone call between Trump and President Erdogan at the weekend, the White House said that the US \u201cwill not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the Isis territorial \u2018Caliphate\u2019, will no longer be in the immediate areas.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Turkish military operation could be a lot more than an incursion and turn into a full scale invasion, probably much deeper than the expected 100 km stretch, and it seems that the US will do nothing about it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Most important is that this could be a political life saver for him as he faces an increasingly challenging domestic political environment.\n\nSome of Erdogan\u2019s old political allies \u2013 such as Abdullah Gul, Ahmet Davutoglu and Ali Babacan \u2013 are all in the process of establishing their own political parties. In fact, Erdogan\u2019s AK Party is still badly wounded after losing the June Istanbul mayoral election to Ekrem Imamoglu who continues to increase his political popularity throughout the country. On top of all these political worries, the economy is not doing well either.\n\nHowever, the presence of nearly 4 million Syrian refugees in the country will be the most significant deciding issue for the electorate in the country, and Erdogan needs to find a face-saving way to start sending them back home if he wants a boost his chances of re-election.\n\nFor Trump, the driver seems to be costs, as he wants to have nothing to do with the 12,000 captured Isis fighters, 4,000 of whom are foreign nationals. In short, the US government is disappointed with the refusal of European states to take their own Isis fighters back, and as pointed out by the White House statement, \u201cThe United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer.\u201d\n\nSo, with this new agreement over Turkey\u2019s forthcoming military intervention, \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all Isis fighters in the areas captured over the past two years\u2026\u201d\n\nIn other words, Erdogan has agreed to be the prison guard for northern Syria in return for some political gains for his own domestic survival.\n\nOnly back in January, Trump threatened to \u201cdevastate Turkey economically\u201d, if it carried out a military operation against the Kurds in northern Syria. And so it is not surprising that they have greeted this news with total disbelief.\n\nAn alliance with the Syrian regime might now be the only realistic option for them to continue with their political aspirations, as Turkey considers the SDF an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody conflict for a Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for nearly four decades. Turkey is likely to hit hard the SDF\u2019s militia \u2013 the YPG \u2013 in its forthcoming military intervention.\n\nThe Kurds will also struggle to secure the support of the Assad regime, especially considering that a strong alliance has recently been developed between Turkey, Russia and Iran over the future of Syria.\n\nThe Kurds\u2019 feelings of betrayal are real, and they have been left between a rock and hard place. Trump\u2019s pursuit of short-term expediency might well change forever the Kurds\u2019 narratives on who to trust and how to survive in the Middle East.\n\nAlpaslan Ozerdem is Dean of the School for Conflict Analysis & Resolution and professor of peace and conflict studies at George Mason University.", "description": "It is no secret that Turkey has been planning a large scale military operation to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria for a long time.
