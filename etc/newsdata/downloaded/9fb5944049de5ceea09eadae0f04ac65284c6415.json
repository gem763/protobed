However, that is meaningless if there is not a positive reaction on the pitch against Manchester United next weekend and few supporters are in the mood to listen to excuses.\n\nResults make for grim reading for players and fans of Newcastle Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nStory continues\n\nBruce also told his players on Sunday evening that they would not be in training on Monday as he did not want to see them again so soon after the debacle at Leicester. It is understood the former Manchester United captain told his staff that he could not promise he would not explode a second time if he saw them on Monday morning and needs time to reflect on how bad things have become so quickly.\n\nInstead, he will wait to see what sort of reaction he gets from the players after the dust has settled on Tuesday. A player meeting, without the manager, is planned for later this week, which will be led by captain Jamaal Lascelles, who was equally forthright in criticism of his teammates in the dressing room.\n\nBruce\u2019s display of anger is unusual in the modern game, with managers often preferring to offer more gentle criticism during one-on-one meetings with players, but few will blame him for losing his temper on this occasion.\n\nNewcastle capitulated at Leicester following Isaac Hayden\u2019s red card just before half time and the second half was unacceptable on every level.\n\nNewcastle substitute Andy Carroll labelled the performance 'terrible' Credit: PA\n\nBruce, though, carries ultimate responsibility for that and knows it will be his job on the line if results do not improve.\n\nHe has won just one of his seven Premier League games in charge and his team have produced two abysmal performances in a row, having also struggled at home during a goalless draw with Brighton last weekend in which they enjoyed just 30% possession.\n\nFor now, the players seem to be with him as striker Andy Carroll also publicly criticised his teammates.\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely shocking,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cThe fans singing all the way through, I felt sorry for them. The first half was OK. The second half we came out and I can\u2019t even tell you how bad it was.\n\n\u201cWe need to put it right on the training pitch. We can\u2019t play like that again. We gave up, completely gave up. It was absolutely terrible and the gaffer is fuming in there. And rightly so - it was terrible. We can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We have to kick on.\n\n\u201cWe have got strength in the dressing room and a great attitude in training. But what happened was a disgrace.\u201d", "description": "Newcastle United\u2019s players remained completely silent during a brutal appraisal of their dismal performance at Leicester City by manager Steve Bruce as he questioned both their desire and ability to play for the club.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sOV6fgE_zgbSEx9PVOpL0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zLgMT7cObxwQwLNzS7ZMZw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/0100bd55e537fe45c590f42c318e453e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
