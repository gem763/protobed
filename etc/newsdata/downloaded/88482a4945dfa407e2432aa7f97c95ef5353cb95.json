(Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLONDON \u2014 British travel company Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy Monday, stranding hundreds of thousands of holiday-makers and prompting the British government to initiate what it is calling the largest peacetime repatriation in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nThe effort, dubbed Operation Matterhorn, aims to fly 150,000 travelers who were booked on Thomas Cook flights back home to Britain. The mammoth task is expected to cost more than $120 million, said the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\n\nThe organization has chartered dozens of planes to fly Thomas Cook travelers home free of charge beginning Monday. Other travelers will be booked on already scheduled flights by other airlines.\n\n\u201cAll customers currently abroad with Thomas Cook who are booked to return to the UK over the next two weeks will be brought home as close as possible to their booked return date,\u201d said a government statement.\n\nScott Hamilton, managing director of Leeham Co., an aviation consultancy, said it would be an operation of extreme magnitude.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really quite the airlift,\u201d Hamilton said. He speculated that the British government was primarily trying to book as many passengers on other airlines as possible, in addition to chartering aircraft.\n\nMalaysian Airlines reportedly sent at least one Airbus A380, which can seat nearly 500 people, to Manchester, England, presumably to be used for the operation.\n\nIf a similar scenario was occurring in the United States, Hamilton said, it would be \u201cevery man, woman and child for themselves.\u201d The United States has limited laws protecting air passengers from flight cancellations within the United States. The European Union, renowned for its air passenger rights, has enacted a variety of laws to protect travelers from the financial burden of flight cancellations and delays.\n\n[Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse leaves hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded]\n\nIn addition to Britain, other governments also announced special measures Monday.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism ordered hotel staff to not evict or demand extra payments from stranded tourists who had booked their stays with Thomas Cook. The Turkish warning came after reports that several hotels worldwide were refusing to allow some customers to leave their premises unless they paid additional fees.\n\nGerman aviation analyst Elmar Giemulla said such practices constituted \u201cextortion,\u201d but it was unclear whether travelers who had been successfully pressured into paying hotels would be refunded by insurance or the government.\n\nIn countries particularly affected by the Thomas Cook bankruptcy, local officials said Monday that they were helping to coordinate the repatriations.\n\nIn Cyprus, authorities met with representatives of the tourism industry to discuss the repatriation of foreigners from the country \u2014 and to prepare for adverse repercussions of the bankruptcy on the local tourism industry. Until now, Thomas Cook had accounted for about 5 to 6 percent of all arrivals there, according to the Cyprus Mail. The demise of Thomas Cook also triggered calls in Cyprus to better prepare for similar bankruptcies in the future.\n\nBritish government representatives are expected to be present at the airports from which repatriation flights will depart in the coming two weeks, according to the Cyprus Mail.\n\nWhile the collapse of Thomas Cook has predominantly affected British travelers, the German subsidiary of the company, Condor, is similarly at risk of faltering in the coming days. In that case, Germany would be unlikely to launch a similar government-led effort to repatriate its nationals stranded abroad, Giemulla said.\n\nAfter at least one airline bankruptcy in recent years, representatives of the German aviation industry coordinated those efforts themselves, relying on insurance fees to fund the repatriation efforts.\n\n\u201cA number of airlines would jump in to help,\u201d Giemulla said.\n\nOperation Matterhorn recalls a similar instance in 2017 when Britain\u2019s Monarch Airlines collapsed. At the time, the CAA also stepped in, planning out travel for Monarch patrons to return to Britain in the two weeks after the airline\u2019s closure. Ultimately, the agency operated 700 flights as part of the effort to transport 110,000 stranded passengers home, the Guardian reported.", "description": "The effort, dubbed Operation Matterhorn, is expected to bring 150,000 travelers back to Britain and cost more than $120 million.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security", "Assistant Editor", "Foreign Desk", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T5-IzRK2iJ5qFJArPfg1TJ367NQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWCZAPG6B4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
