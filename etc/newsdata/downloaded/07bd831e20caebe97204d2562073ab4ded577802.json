REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\nSpeaking to Reuters ahead of the fifth anniversary of the start of the Umbrella, or \u201cOccupy\u201d movement, Tai said he watched from jail in disbelief as one million people thronged the streets of Hong Kong on June 9 to launch the latest bout of pro-democracy protests.\n\n\u201cThe young people, in some ways, they have been changed by the Umbrella movement,\u201d said Tai, a law professor.\n\n\u201cWe have revolutionized, in some ways, the hearts of Hong Kong people in preparing them for fighting for democracy in a more persistent way.\u201d\n\nTo mark the anniversary on Saturday, thousands of people are expected to rally at Tamar Park near government headquarters.\n\nTai, who was released on bail in August, said while leaders of the Umbrella movement were in some ways unprepared for the massive response at the start of the rallies that paralyzed parts of the financial hub for 79 days, they helped to sow the seeds for future protests.\n\nThe Umbrella sit-in protests, also known as the Occupy Central with Love and Peace campaign, were first suggested by Tai in 2013 and were later led by a core group, some of who remain in prison. It became known as the Umbrella movement after activists used umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nHong Kong returned to China from British rule in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland but many activists accuse Beijing of tightening its grip on the city and eroding those freedoms.\n\nThe Umbrella protests blocked major roads in the Asian financial hub for more than two months in a push for full democracy, although they failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.\n\nColorful tents, art installations and music created an almost carnival atmosphere at times, in stark contrast to the current anti-government protests that have increasingly degenerated into running battles between activists and police.\n\n\u201cI think the tension now is how far we should go, especially the more radical protesters, how far they should go,\u201d said Tai.\n\nTai said he doesn\u2019t think the current movement will last forever, although that won\u2019t mean people have given up.\n\n\u201cMaybe after a few months the streets will become more quiet ... and when another triggering point (comes), you will rise again and the scale will be even bigger than the \u2018Water Revolution\u2019,\u201d he said. In the current campaign, activists are using what they call a \u201cBe Water\u201d strategy that encourages them to be flexible or formless.\n\nThe current protests have no discernible leaders or structure, which Tai believes is a better strategy than the \u201ctop down\u201d order of the Umbrella movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a more decentralized network way of co-ordinating action and it seems to be much more effective than the Umbrella movement,\u201d Tai said.\n\nThe softly-spoken professor, who said he read around 20 books during his three months in prison, said he was hopeful about the future, although he expects more suppression from the government.\n\n\u201cSome protesters, they think this is the last battle but I would say this may not be the last battle because we have a long war to fight and no matter what happens to this particular battle, if we could not have democracy, the war will continue.\u201d", "description": "Benny Tai, a leading Hong Kong activist who was jailed for his role in the 2014 pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" movement, says that campaign \"revolutionized\" youngsters and set the stage for the current protests on the streets of the China-ruled territory.", "authors": ["Anne Marie Roantree", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434452858&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0EJ", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
