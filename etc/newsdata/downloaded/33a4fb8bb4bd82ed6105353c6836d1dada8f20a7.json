Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) secret impeachment hearings.\n\nThat is not hyperbole, those are the headlines \u2014 \u201csmoking gun.\u201d\n\nSo here we are again with Russian Collusion 2 in full swing, with the WALLS CLOSING IN ON TRUMP, and all of it backed by a coordinated news cycle about how President Trump is toast, done, over and out, corrupt and kaput fer realzies this time. Except\u2026\n\nOnce again, it\u2019s all fake news (but you knew that).\n\nEven though Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment inquiry is supposed to be secret, leaks to the far-left CNN-NYTimes-WashPost geared for the Get Drumpf! crowd are currently being reported everywhere without a hint of scrutiny from the media, unaware or unashamed of being so obviously manipulated by the Schiff Cabal.\n\nSomeone, somehow leaked Taylor\u2019s opening statement to the media \u2014 and, gee, we can only sit here and imagine who that might have been.\n\nMeanwhile, even though we are talking about a process designed to overturn a national election, the accused \u2014 President Trump \u2014 has no rights, nor do his surrogates among House Republicans. They are not only restricted from calling their own witnesses, which is unprecedented in the history of impeachment, they cannot even publicize their side of the story without violating Schiff\u2019s fascist rules.\n\nWorse still, while Taylor\u2019s opening statement is leaked to the media, this one-sided document from a career diplomat who obviously despises Trump, the transcripts and recordings of his entire testimony remain hidden, guarded, secreted away\u2026 And the so-called media are perfectly fine with this, perfectly happy to publish what Schiff wants them to publish, even though they know it does not tell the full truth.\n\nAnd in the specific case of Taylor, according to three Republican Congressman who were in the room, the testimony Taylor gave that completely undercuts the narrative about his \u201csmoking gun\u201d opening statement remains hidden from the public, and we are now stuck with an incurious press that just doesn\u2019t want to hear the full and inconvenient truth.\n\nAppearing with Sean Hannity on Fox News after Taylor\u2019s testimony, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) said, \u201cThe truth is, in two minutes, John Ratcliffe destroyed this witness. There is no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Rep. Ratcliffe (R-TX) himself verified this while complaining (justifiably) about how he is restricted from revealing the full truth of what happened. He did, though, say what he felt he could:\n\nI found [Taylor] to be very forthright. He had very strong opinions about Donald Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy. But again, the mainstream media reporting that he provided evidence of a quid pro quo involving military aid is false. I questioned him directly on that. And under [House Intelligence Chairman] Adam Schiff\u2019s rules I can\u2019t tell you what he said, but I can tell you what he didn\u2019t say. And neither he or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\n\nUsing Twitter, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) said of Taylor\u2019s testimony and the lapdog media\u2019s coverage of it\u2026 \u201cThe leaks out of today\u2019s witness interview have been laughably overblown and don\u2019t tell the full story. Still no evidence of quid pro quo. Much of the statement and hearsay allegations didn\u2019t hold up against any real scrutiny. The FULL transcript should be released immediately.\u201d\n\nThis has been the cycle since the beginning of Schiff\u2019s Star Chamber: The worst possible testimony is leaked out of context, and it sounds awful \u2014 at least until we get the other side of the story, where we inevitably learn that this whole thing is going nowhere, that all the evidence points to there being no quid pro quo, to us learning how Schiff is badgering witnesses to say what he wants.\n\nSo we are currently enjoying a remarkable time in history where congressional Democrats are looking to overturn a presidential election using secret testimony backed by selective leaks, and the national media are colluding with them as if this is all normal and okay.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
