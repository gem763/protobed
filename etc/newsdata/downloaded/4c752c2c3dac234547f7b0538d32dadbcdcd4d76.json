The slogans are decided and preparations are being stepped up.\n\nThat \u201cget Brexit done\u201d is a far more powerful pitch than \u201creal change\u201d explains why Boris Johnson is keen on a snap election after his Brexit strategy was derailed by last night\u2019s Commons decision to reject his rushed timetable for passing the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.\n\n\u201cReal change\u201d tells us that Labour doesn\u2019t want a \u201cBrexit election,\u201d and would try to repeat its brilliant 2017 trick by shifting the focus to the effects of a decade of Tory austerity. But with a no-deal Brexit about to be taken off the table, Jeremy Corbyn is running out of excuses to avoid an early poll.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Yet it is Johnson who is acting cynically as he tries to engineer an election. He deserved last night\u2019s defeat after not providing enough time for MPs to scrutinise his deal; he had offered MPs a measly and inadequate three days of debate. Nikki da Costa, the prime minister's director of legislative affairs, proposed 13 days for the bill in the Commons and a total of 37 days including time to pass through the Lords when she did the same job for Theresa May.\n\nOffering five more days now, as Labour reasonably demands, would almost certainly secure the passage of a timetable motion. Will Johnson do it? Or will he instead use his latest Commons setback as an excuse to call an election, grabbing his best chance to win an overall majority and avoid limping on at the head of a zombie government?\n\nSome ministers believe Johnson has a platform to get his deal approved after last night\u2019s impressive 30-vote margin on second reading. They think he would reap an eventual reward for \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d in a spring election. They suspect a short delay beyond 31 October would not damage Johnson any further: Nigel Farage would stamp his feet, but the latest opinion polls show the Tories 13-15 points ahead, as Johnson hoovers up the Leave vote.\n\nPressing ahead with his now \"paused\" bill would be the statesmanlike thing to do, but the signs are that Johnson is increasingly tempted by an election. Some aides think a pre-Brexit election, with his ready-made deal the centrepiece, would allow him to appeal to Labour Leave voters in the North and Midlands, without losing moderate Tory supporters in the South who might have been repelled if he had sought a mandate for no deal. They hope the Remain vote would split between opposition parties, allowing the Tories to secure a majority even if they won only about 35 per cent of the vote.\n\nTrue to form, Johnson will blame everyone else for missing his rash 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d Brexit deadline. I expect the EU27 to offer a \u201cflextension\u201d, a maximum extension of three months that could end earlier, as soon as parliament approved the bill. That would protect the EU from charges of interfering in UK politics, since a delay until January was specified by the Benn Act which forced Johnson to grudgingly seek an extension.\n\nIt might suit Johnson to misrepresent such an offer as a minimum three month extension, reject it and propose an election. He said he would not negotiate an extension but is probably doing just that today in a series of telephone calls to EU leaders. He would prefer them to offer a very short extension of a few weeks, which might persuade him to try again to get the bill through.\n\nIf Johnson demands an election, Corbyn would have a dilemma. His own instincts have always been, as one loyalist put it, to \u201chave the confidence to go for it.\u201d He was energised by the 2017 campaign; Labour started 20 points behind and narrowed the gap to just two points. Yet some shadow cabinet ministers worry that Labour could repeat such a performance in a pre-Brexit election, and so back a \u201creferendum first\u201d stance.\n\nMany Labour backbenchers fear the party would fall between two stools with an election pitch of a Final Say referendum (with a choice between a soft Brexit and Remain) that could alienate Leave and Remain voters alike. In contrast, a pre-Brexit election would be better for the Liberal Democrats who, like the Tories, would benefit from having a clear policy on Brexit \u2013 in the Lib Dems\u2019 case, scrapping it altogether. (What would the Lib Dems say in a post-Brexit election?)\n\nA Final Say would be a much cleaner and fairer way to resolve Brexit than a general election in which some people would vote on other issues. There is no longer any argument about the referendum question now that the prime minister, against the odds, has secured a deal: it would be a straight choice between that deal and Remain.\n\nTrue, Brenda from Bristol would not welcome a referendum. But she wouldn\u2019t want an election either, especially if it ended in a hung parliament \u2013 still a possibility if enough Remainers voted tactically. That would mean the only way to resolve Brexit would be a referendum. And Brenda would be left feeling even more angry.", "description": "\u201cGet Brexit done\u201d or \u201creal change.\u201d I\u2019m told that would be the\u00a0choice that the Conservative and Labour parties respectively offer the country if there is a pre-Christmas general election.
