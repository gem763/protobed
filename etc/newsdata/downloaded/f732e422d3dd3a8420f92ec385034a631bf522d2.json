Her mother's lasting memory of her youngest daughter is the day she viewed a battered skull and a few broken bones in the coroner's office.\n\n'I take stock. A daughter who is dead, a wife who just stares at the wall, a sister who struggles to get her day together, a 100-year-old grandmother who sits in a home with soft memories and a father who puts it in all a box and tries to shut the lid \u2013 so we all carry on.'\n\nMiss Hall's parents have reinstated a \u00a350,000 reward for information provided to the police which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for her murder.\n\nTo date, Avon and Somerset Police has received 1,751 calls from the public about the case and taken 1,668 statements.\n\nPolice are asking for anyone who owned a length \u2013 or lengths \u2013 of blue polypropylene rope that went missing around June 1996 or knew someone who had rope of this kind and whose behaviour had changed since that date to come forward.\n\nDetectives also want to speak to anyone who saw suspicious activity or a vehicle parked at the crime site at Thornbury in the early hours of June 9 or in the following days.", "description": "Melanie Hall, 25, was last seen alive in Cadillacs nightclub in Bath in 1996.
