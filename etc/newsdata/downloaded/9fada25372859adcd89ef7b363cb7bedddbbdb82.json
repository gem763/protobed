The trip stopped by various locales previously visited by 19th-century Arctic explorers, and its participants studied the glaciers as well as the plants and animals present on the islands.\n\nSmaller boats brought participants between a main vessel and the islands. It was one of these crafts that a mother walrus reportedly attacked and sank, perhaps because she felt her cubs were being threatened.\n\nWalruses are large, tusked marine mammals in the same pinniped clade as seals and sea lions. They inhabit icy Arctic waters and can weigh over a ton.\n\nWalrus attacks on humans and their vessels aren\u2019t uncommon, according to Lori Quakenbush, a biologist from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game\u2019s Arctic Marine Mammal Program (who was not on the Russian vessel). \u201cWe have to be careful during research not to get surrounded by ice and walruses without an escape route. Calves are curious and will approach a boat, which makes the mother aggressive to defend the calf,\u201d Quakenbush told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cGroups of young males can also be aggressive and dangerous to small boats.\u201d\n\nQuakenbush explained that walrus hunters have encountered walruses puncturing skin boats with their tusks or even flipping over aluminium boats.\n\nIn short, if you ever find yourself confronted by walruses, you better have an escape plan.", "description": "A walrus attacked and sunk a Russian naval boat with scientists and media on board last week, according to a Russian Geographical Society press release....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Robb Holland"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/l1wni19dlpvgdfpfoxrb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
