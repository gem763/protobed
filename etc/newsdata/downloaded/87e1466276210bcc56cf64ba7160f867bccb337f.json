In line with Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol, England reported the abuse to the referee, Ivan Bebek, who passed on a message to be broadcast over the PA system for it to stop.\n\nEngland crush Bulgaria 6-0 but racist chants force stoppages in qualifier Read more\n\nIn the 41st minute, following further abuse and more complaints from England, Bebek temporarily stopped the game and asked Southgate whether he wanted to take his players off to the dressing room. The manager said they wanted to make it to half-time. There were further talks during the interval but England were determined to play on in the second-half \u2013 to show the racists they would not win, to quote Clarke. There remained the threat that they would walk off if there was more abuse and the game, which finished in a 6-0 England win, would be abandoned.\n\n\u201cI know that whatever we do might be perceived as not being enough but I think we\u2019ve made a major statement,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a major statement with the way we played, through such difficult circumstances. I don\u2019t think a game of this magnitude has ever been stopped twice. So, I\u2019m incredibly proud of all of the players and all of the staff.\n\n\u201cWe could be criticised for not going far enough but I think we\u2019ve made a huge statement and, frankly, we were in an impossible situation to get it right to the satisfaction of everybody.\n\n\u201cThe players were all absolutely adamant they wanted to keep playing but also we knew, if there was anything in the second half, we\u2019d be reporting it and coming off.\u201d\n\nSouthgate gave an insight into how steeled his players now were to racist abuse. \u201cSadly, because of their experiences in our own country, they are hardened to racism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about our society but that\u2019s the reality. It actually saddens me. So they actually are in the dressing room smiling because they\u2019ve played so well.\n\nVile and disturbing Sofia spectacle will live long in sporting infamy | Barney Ronay Read more\n\n\u201cWe will recognise there\u2019s been an opportunity tonight to raise awareness of this issue and I think that has happened. But Raheem Sterling has got the hump with me for taking him off when he\u2019s on a hat-trick. Sometimes you have to smile through adversity. We all knew we were in a pretty impossible situation so we\u2019ve tried to navigate it in the best way we could.\u201d\n\nSterling later retweeted a news story in which the Bulgaria coach, Krasimir Balakov, accused England of having a bigger racism problem than his own country. \u201cMmmmh\u201a not sure about this one chief,\u201d Sterling wrote. \u201cFeeling sorry for Bulgaria to be represented by such idiots in their stadium. Anyway, 6-0 and we go back home. At least we did our job. Safe travel to our fans, you guys did well.\u201d\n\nMings said: \u201cI heard [the chants] before I even got to the other side of the pitch for the warm-up. Just before half-time we were contemplating coming off because that was the next step after a stadium announcement. There were a couple of minutes to go to half-time, so we thought we\u2019d play the couple of minutes, go in and talk about it then, which we did and we made a collective decision.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t affect my feelings. I think I\u2019m quite lucky in that way because I don\u2019t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don\u2019t have a voice, so it didn\u2019t hurt or harm my feelings one bit. It was obviously bigger than me and bigger than what I felt.\u201d\n\nThe Bulgaria captain, Ivelin Popov, was seen in a heated debate with a section of home supporters near to the tunnel as the teams departed for half-time. \u201cI\u2019ve been told what the Bulgaria captain did at half-time,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cTo stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d", "description": "The England manager said he was \u2018incredibly proud\u2019 after his team were forced to play through monkey chants in their 6-0 win against Bulgaria", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a450d140d71e7e5dde6fe67e80b3f0f29bff8d7a/0_0_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71ff5c5fa9116aad0cdb2d8398ce78f6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
