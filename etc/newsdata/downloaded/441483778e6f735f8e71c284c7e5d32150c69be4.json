I felt quite nervous because I was being followed,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018What if I can\u2019t turn this off? Am I always going to be walking to my car and there are people with cameras there? Does this last for ever?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer was no. Hunt is 56 now, and the intervening decades have brought her a more interesting, but intrinsically more private life. After starting her career as a television actor at the age of nine, she has forged a successful life behind the camera, as well as in front of it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have that kind of fame now,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been, in my personal life, so intriguing that I\u2019ll always be that famous. I haven\u2019t tried to make that happen. I\u2019d like to be well known so I can get more jobs, but it has quietened down.\u201d\n\nDoes she remember the turning point? She traces it back to 2004, when she had her daughter, Makena Lei. \u201cI spent much less time working and doing interviews and more time in private, so it just naturally quietened down and that was nice. I don\u2019t get followed any more, and it doesn\u2019t disturb my life. I get good theatre tickets, and that\u2019s worth all of it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hunt with Jack Nicholson in the 1997 film As Good As It Gets.

But she sees it very differently. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny when people ask: \u2018What happened to you?\u2019 Well, I had a baby \u2013 I made a whole person \u2013 and I co-wrote, directed and produced two entire films so it didn\u2019t seem so quiet to me. There\u2019s a difference between working hard and being famous.\u201d\n\nThe films she is referring to are Then She Found Me (2007) and Ride (2014). The former centres on the complicated relationship between a 39-year-old woman (Hunt), who is estranged from her husband and longs for a child, and her biological mother (Bette Midler), who reappears in her life after the death of her adoptive mother. The film is loosely based on a novel by Elinor Lipman, but Hunt included a fertility struggle because, at the time, she was trying to get pregnant and it was all she could think about. \u201cHaving a biological clock pounding in my ears, I thought: \u2018Well, if I\u2019m going to play this part, she\u2019s got to either have a baby or want to have a baby.\u201d\n\nHunt spent 10 years getting the film off the ground, only for the distributor, Think Film, to go bankrupt before the film\u2019s release, meaning there was no promotion and no advertising.\n\n\u201cThat was the most crushing \u2026\u201d she breaks off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away from the experience of making it, but then you want people to see what you did. So that was hard; that was very hard.\u201d In interviews from that time, she comes across as defensive and prickly. In hindsight, she was probably heartbroken. \u201cI would like to blink and have everybody in the world have seen it,\u201d she says now.\n\nWhen we meet in Los Angeles, she has come straight from the writers\u2019 room for the forthcoming reboot of Mad About You. The US comedy, about a newly married New York couple, ran from 1992 to 1999. Hunt won three Golden Globes for her razor-sharp portrayal of PR Jamie Buchman. She and her co-star, Paul Reiser (who played Jamie\u2019s husband), will executive produce and star in 12 new episodes. Hunt will also direct the first episode, having recently served as a director on episodes of the major US hits This Is Us and Feud, as well as The Politician, Ryan Murphy\u2019s latest big project for Netflix.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hunt with (left) Paul Reiser as her husband and Kevin Bacon as himself in Mad About You.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be good in something, that\u2019s what makes it exciting; the risk that it might not go well. I\u2019m pretty practised at putting the worry aside.\u201d\n\nShe and her daughter, who is now 15, are both politically engaged. They have attended marches together, including the Women\u2019s March held the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Hunt has been active in fighting for equality on the Mad About You reboot. Most of the 11 directors are women, including women of colour. \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to fight for pay parity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder than you think. People who pay the money say: \u2018Well, I want pay parity, but this man has more experience.\u2019 To which we\u2019re replying: \u2018Yes, but what was the context? Was this woman given the same opportunities as this man?\u2019 It\u2019s entirely possible he had more options than she did, so we fight for pay parity in order to take that context into account.\u201d\n\nIt is not something she thought about when starring opposite, say, Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets or Tom Hanks in Cast Away. \u201cAt that point in my career, I didn\u2019t know to fight for it. It never occurred to me I should be paid the same amount. Quite frankly, they could have argued people were buying tickets because of Jack or Tom, and that would have been correct.\u201d\n\nHas she noticed any other changes in the industry since the advent of the Time\u2019s Up movement? \u201cI think it has made movie sets somewhat safer; there\u2019s some amount of recourse if you feel in danger or objectified,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does feel like now you could get in trouble, and thank God.\u201d\n\nOver the years, she has worked with Mel Gibson, Kevin Spacey and Woody Allen. Should we be boycotting their work? \u201cHere\u2019s the only thing I can really contribute,\u201d she says, choosing her words carefully. \u201cI think a big part of the problem is that if a woman is assaulted, by the time they feel they can get the words out of their mouth, there are statute of limitation laws that say \u2018too late\u2019. So, while I understand the backlash of, \u2018you just point a finger at me and my career\u2019s over\u2019, until those laws are revised, it\u2019s going to be a giant, painful mess and it shouldn\u2019t be only up to the women who have been victimised to metabolise that. That issue is bigger than anybody sees. My understanding is that it has much more to do with a backlog in court. That\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hunt with (from left) Salman Rushdie, Colin Firth and Matthew Broderick in Then She Found Me.

Hunt plays Nancy Campbell, a war correspondent who is a victim of sexual violence, loosely based on the trailblazing British journalist Clare Hollingworth, who broke the news of the outbreak of the second world war.\n\nHunt did meticulous research, for better or worse. \u201cOn that set, I began to know things that some people don\u2019t, unless you do a deep dive in that particular area. Of course, there\u2019s sexual violence everywhere \u2013 it\u2019s one of the great atrocities of our age \u2013 but I didn\u2019t understand it was as institutionalised and organised. That fuelled a lot of what I did. And with all the sexual violence being illuminated at home in the last few years, I certainly didn\u2019t have to reach very far to have a lot of feelings about that.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling that Campbell was contemporary. She\u2019s ahead of everybody in the story and knows what\u2019s coming before other people do. It all seemed very immediate to me, and relevant.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Helen Hunt (as Nancy Campbell) in World on Fire. Photograph: Dusan Martincek/Mammoth Screen 2019\n\nThe call to be in World on Fire came out of the blue. \u201cWould you like to go to Prague and act in something?\u201d She doesn\u2019t leave her daughter very often, she says, \u201cbut everything lined up. I remember thinking: \u2018The material\u2019s good, the part is good, the city is good.\u2019 I mean, I don\u2019t have a complaint.\u201d\n\nParts like that get given to her only once in a blue moon, she says. \u201cMost of your life as an actor is trying to persuade people you can do a part.\u201d Surely, there\u2019s less persuasion involved once you have an Oscar? \u201cOften with women, there\u2019s a big dry spell afterwards,\u201d she says. \u201cI heard an actress say that, for about a year you\u2019ve got some wind at your back, but after that, you just go back to finding a good job. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big game-changer. It can be, but it\u2019s not like your worries are over in terms of getting good parts. I\u2019ve had ups and downs. It was a dream come true, which is a great thing to be able to say; then you go back to work, trying to forge a career that\u2019s fulfilling.\u201d\n\nHunt was born and brought up in Culver City, California, the home of many major movie studios over the years, and was inspired to get into the industry by her father, a director and acting coach. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hunt\u2019s daughter is keen to follow her mother into the family business. \u201cI can hardly say I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in me saying anything other than: \u2018I hope it\u2019s wonderful,\u2019 because she already loves it. I can\u2019t cure the endless, \u2018Will I work again?\u2019 thing that every actor has, including Meryl Streep. I\u2019m always sure it\u2019s the last job.\u201d\n\nWorld on Fire starts on BBC One later this year", "description": "The actor and director talks about the perils of fame, sexual violence in the industry and returning to the screen in the Mad About You reboot and the new BBC drama World on Fire", "authors": ["Martha Hayes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710ff33468a220a94030b450b276170b13dac931/0_13_5387_3231/master/5387.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20b1efd34f0b1d75c6a7f5ec32722ffe"}
