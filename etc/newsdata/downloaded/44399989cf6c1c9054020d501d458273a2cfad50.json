Giuliani said he confirmed this with Jane Raskin, another member of the Trump legal team, adding that the agreement is a recent development. Giuliani also said he has talked about the agreement and Corsi with President Trump in recent days, and that Trump told him he \u201cvaguely knows\u201d Corsi, but \u201cdoesn\u2019t remember the last time they spoke.\u201d\n\nThe Trump lawyer added that he knew of Corsi\u2019s work years ago on the \u201cbirther stuff.\u201d\n\nCorsi and Trump\u2019s past relationship wasn\u2019t merely a one-off thing. In April 2011, Michael Cohen, then Trump\u2019s personal attorney and notorious fixer, told NBC News that the future president was promised a pre-publication copy of Corsi\u2019s book, Where\u2019s the Birth Certificate? . Cohen said that \u201cJerome Corsi had reached out to Mr. Trump to explain certain facts that are in his book,\u201d and that the two men had spoken \u201con a handful of occasions.\u201d\n\nA month later, Trump called out Corsi in a statement to Mother Jones magazine, challenging Corsi\u2019s assertion that Trump had told him that the long-form birth certificate Obama released was a fake. Corsi also claimed Trump said had said he got a computer expert to conclude the certificate was actually computer-generated.\n\n\u201cIs his birth certificate legitimate? I hope it is for the good of the country, but that\u2019s for experts to determine\u2014not me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have not read the book written by Jerry Corsi nor did we discuss whether or not the birth certificate was computer generated or in any way fabricated. I merely asked him how his book was doing and wished him good luck.\u201d\n\nDuring an on-air chat with fellow leading conspiracy theorist (and Trump fan) Alex Jones, Corsi repeatedly vented that Trump had \u201cdropped out\u201d of the birther movement because he got \u201ca big payment\u201d from NBC, as Trump was the host of the reality-TV series Celebrity Apprentice. Corsi and Jones also discussed how it was possible that Trump was a turncoat and had started working secretly with the Obama administration to subvert conservatives and birthers.\n\nStill, that speculation didn\u2019t entirely kill Trump\u2019s desire to share Corsi\u2019s work. About a year later, Trump tweeted, \u201cWeird--why did BarackObama Sr. fail to list @BarackObama as his son in his 1961 INS application?\u201d and linked to Corsi\u2019s WorldNetDaily article titled, \u201cImmigration officers doubted Obama birth story.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller first reported on Tuesday that Corsi, a former Infowars journalist with a Harvard doctorate, and a prominent birther conspiracist, wrote in an upcoming book about his experience in the crosshairs of the special counsel investigation that he has a joint defense agreement with President Trump. Such an agreement, relatively common in criminal cases with multiple witnesses and defendants being investigated by the same prosecutor, allows witnesses and subjects of an investigation to share information about the case.\n\n\u201cAfter debating the pros and cons, we had decided that any time we could get the attorney for the president of the United States to offer assistance to us, we needed to say to be thankful and accept,\u201d Corsi writes in the book, titled Silent No More: How I Became a Political Prisoner of Mueller\u2019s \u2018Witch Hunt.\u2019\n\nIn October, Giuliani told Politico that Team Trump had 32 joint defense agreements with others being investigated by the special counsel\u2019s office. The issue of such deals re-emerged in the Mueller probe this week after the Caller story and a New York Times report that former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyers were still communicating with Trump\u2019s legal team even after Manafort\u2019s conviction and agreement to cooperate with the government.\n\nCorsi, who said this month that he expects to be charged with lying to federal investigators, told CNN that he was offered a plea deal, but has refused to accept the offer.\n\n\u201cThey can put me in prison the rest of my life. I am not going to sign a lie,\u201d Corsi told CNN. He was questioned by Mueller about his links to Trump associate and longtime GOP operative Roger Stone, who has been under investigation for his interactions with WikiLeaks. According to draft court documents obtained by NBC News, Corsi sent an email to Stone tipping him off that there would be document \u201cdumps\u201d two months before WikiLeaks released emails stolen from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWord is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps,\u201d the email reportedly read. \u201cOne shortly after I\u2019m back. 2nd in Oct.
