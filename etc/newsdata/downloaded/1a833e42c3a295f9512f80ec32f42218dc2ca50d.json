Some users claimed they had received automatic refunds ranging from 20 yuan to 264 yuan ($2.80-$37), depending on what packages they subscribe to.\n\nTencent declined to comment on refunds.\n\nThe Houston Rockets became the most popular NBA team in China after drafting Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. He became a star and helped build the NBA\u2019s following in China.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Tencent company name is displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China March 17, 2016.

The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Chinese sports news portal Lanxiong Sports reported it was worth about $1.5 billion.\n\nNearly 500 million people watched last season\u2019s NBA games on Tencent\u2019s video platform, up threefold since the 2014-15 season, Tencent said in July.\n\nTencent isn\u2019t the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA. Chinese Smartphone maker Vivo, state-run broadcaster CCTV and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) all halted cooperation with the NBA on Monday.", "description": "Some Chinese National Basketball Association (NBA) fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent amid a deepening free speech row, a move that could cause the tech giant financial pain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438730816&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980A8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
