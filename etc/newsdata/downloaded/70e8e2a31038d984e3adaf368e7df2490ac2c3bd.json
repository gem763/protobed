Perhaps he would rather be no-confidenced than sign a letter requesting a further postponement of Brexit.\n\nOn the principle that the Queen's government must be carried on, a prime minister cannot resign until they have advised Her Majesty to send for a named successor - and who would that be?\n\nJeremy Corbyn, as Leader of the Opposition, would surely have first dibs, but could he command the Commons majority necessary to form a government?\n\nIf not, then the hunt would be on for some cross-party figure who could muster the support of Labour MPs, Conservative rebels and most of the smaller parties and the disparate collection of independents.\n\nDoes such a snark-like leader even exist? All kinds of names have been touted - Ken Clarke, Hilary Benn, Dominic Grieve and Margaret Beckett - but, like Lewis Carroll's elusive creature, their appeal might fade into nothingness on closer inspection.\n\nThat would leave the Commons flailing around while the clock ticked down to Brexit day. This is why many on the opposition side of the Commons say bringing a no-confidence vote would be a huge tactical error.\n\nThey want a Brexit postponement nailed down first. But the pressure to bring down a prime minister wounded by the Supreme Court Justices is huge - and a hesitation in striking, after all their calls for Boris Johnson to go, would not be easy to explain.\n\nMaybe that is one of the attractions, for the PM's opponents, of launching an investigation into his conduct, and possible contempt of Parliament, which would unfold over the longer term.\n\nAnother Brexit point; since the prorogation did not occur, the 2017 session of Parliament is still under way.\n\nAnd under Speaker Bercow's earlier ruling, the government cannot have a third go at seeking to win MPs' approval for Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in this session.\n\nThis matters because one compromise option being mooted by some Labour MPs was to hold another \"meaningful vote\" on the Theresa May deal.\n\nThat cannot now happen, unless Mr Speaker could be persuaded that new assurances and legislation around it made it a substantially different deal.\n\nAs the session is still going though, all the bills thought to have fallen in the unlawful prorogation now bounce back into parliamentary life.\n\nThese include several measures from Mrs May's Brexit strategy (the Trade Bill, for example) that had languished in limbo for many months because they seemed certain to be amended in ways embarrassing to ministers.\n\nEssential is that they are holdovers from a failed Brexit strategy, so there is little incentive for the government to bring them back before MPs or peers.\n\nThe one that might be fed back into the system is the Domestic Abuse Bill, which was due for a Second Reading Debate when the \"prorogation\" came.\n\nThere was quite a backlash about its demise, and the government committed to bring it back in their next legislative program.", "description": "Will Parliament consider a no confidence motion against the government?", "authors": ["Mark D'Arcy", "Parliamentary Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DBEF/production/_108930365_mediaitem108930364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
