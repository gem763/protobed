No one has ownership of it. It is not a competition.\n\n\u201cNone of this is remotely helpful to the monarchy as an institution. It is promoting discord and taking attention away from the good work senior royals do across the board.\u201d\n\nThe strikingly formal syntax suggested that the briefing was authorized at the highest levels of either Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace, however nobody at either court was willing to confirm or deny the sentiments expressed to the Daily Beast.\n\nLast night, Meghan received an ecstatic welcome at the official opening of the 2019 One Young World (OYW) summit at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nShe was cheered to the rafters as she took to the stage, where she was introduced as \u201c a global champion for the rights of women and girls, activist and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nIn a careful modernizing touch, Meghan, with her hair down and wearing a stunning purple long-sleeved \u2018Babaton Maxwell\u2019 dress by Aritzia, physically stopped OYW co-founder Kate Robertson from curtseying, hugging her joyfully instead.\n\nThe reception by the youthful crowd appeared to bear out comments made by journalist Tom Bradby today, who said that the Sussexes were connecting with a younger demographic: \u201cFor the under 35s the reaction has been almost universally positive and the older you get the more mixed it gets,\u201d he told ABC.\n\nJust hours earlier a source close to Team Sussex had suggested to CNN that the newlyweds had \u201csingle-handedly modernized\u201d the British royal family, and suggested they were not getting appropriate recognition or support for this task, and were surrounded by \u201cinexperienced and fearful\u201d staff.\n\nThis was widely perceived to be a retaliatory strike for comments William\u2019s camp made, telling a journalist from the BBC that he was concerned for his \u201cfragile\u201d brother in the wake of the bombshell ITV documentary in which Harry and Meghan spoke at length about their unhappiness (which, if you are keen to see the whole thing, screens on ABC tonight, Wednesday, at 10pm EST).\n\nTom Bradby, who conducted the interview, admitted to Good Morning America that he and Harry had had \u201ca couple of private heart to hearts\u201d before the cameras started rolling. He \u201cfound a couple that seemed bruised and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s astonishing attack recalled for many observers the so called \u201cWar of the Waleses\u201d in the 1990s when Diana and Charles used the press to launch a series of astonishing and deeply damaging attacks on each other.\n\nThe bitter campaign culminated in Diana\u2019s Panorama interview in which she both accused Charles of adultery and confessed to her own.\n\nIn the comments made today to the Mail, the insider went on to say that Meghan and Harry have a mentality of \u201cus against the world,\u201d which they described as \u201ca real shame.\u201d\n\nMeghan and Harry have appeared to be fully focused on trying to spin the documentary as a great triumph in recent days\u2014although many have questioned the wisdom of speaking about their own unhappiness when visiting landmine victims and other underprivileged people in some of the poorest regions of the world\u2014while also refuting the negative claims made about them.\n\nThe Sun for example reported that Harry was \u201cstronger than ever\u201d saying, \u201cHarry is back at Frogmore Cottage and has never been stronger. This is an institution full of people panicked they may potentially look out of touch and ultimately to blame for a lack of support.\u201d\n\nThe cover of the 310th anniversary edition of Tatler, the British society magazine, was also unveiled Wednesday, featuring a picture of Meghan on its cover.\n\nThe coverline of the December issue reads: \u201cThe Meghan Issue: Does she conquer or divide?\u201d The society magazine has apparently conducted an \u201cexclusive nationwide poll on the country\u2019s opinions on Meghan,\u201d and engaged leading writers like Lynn Barber and Lionel Shriver to hold forth too.", "description": "As the bombshell royal documentary screens on ABC this evening, a royal source says, \u201cModernization is an ongoing process led by Her Majesty the queen.
