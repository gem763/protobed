It was proposed by opposition lawmakers, including those from the party of Alberto Fernandez, the Peronist opposition candidate and front-runner in the Oct. 27 presidential election.\n\n\u201cPoverty is not a petty problem. We have lived in a social and food emergency since 2002,\u201d said Senator Luis Naidenoff, president for the ruling party\u2019s bloc in the Senate.\n\nArgentine economic growth has stalled since last year, while inflation, running at 54.5% for the last 12 months, is far outstripping salaries, leading to a sharp uptick in poverty, official data shows. The economic crisis spiraled further after the shock results of a primary vote in August dimmed President Mauricio Macri\u2019s chances for re-election.\n\nMacri announced several emergency measures in the week after the primary election in an effort to bring some relief to consumers, including a sales tax cut on some basic food products, including bread, sugar and milk, until the end of year.", "description": "Argentina's Senate unanimously approved a law on Wednesday that will increase state funds dedicated to fighting hunger and improving nutrition as the country grapples with stifling inflation and increased poverty.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
