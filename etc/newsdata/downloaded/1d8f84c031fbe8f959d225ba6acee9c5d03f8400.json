To secure an early election, Johnson needs either to win Monday's vote in Parliament, or lose a no-confidence vote, which so far opposition parties have refused to call.\n\nMr Johnson grudgingly asked for a three-month delay until January 31 as demanded by a law passed by Parliament, which wants to avert the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nSmaller opposition parties said they wanted an election but were wary of doing it on Johnson's terms.\n\n\"The UK government has no coherent plan to end the Brexit chaos and a general election will not solve the crisis,\" said Adam Price, leader of the Welsh party Plaid Cymru.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson said it would be \"morally incredible\" if opposition lawmakers blocked an election.\n\n\"It is time, frankly, for this Parliament to make way for a new, fresh Parliament that can deliver on the priorities of the British people,\" he said.\n\nThough the EU has not yet given its answer, Mr Johnson said it looked like the bloc would grant the delay.\n\n\"I'm afraid it looks as though our EU friends are going to respond to Parliament's request by having an extension, which I really don't want at all,\" he said.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the other 27 EU nations grant Britain a delay, yet many of the bloc's members are weary and frustrated at Britain's interminable Brexit melodrama. But they also want to avoid the economic pain that would come to both sides from a sudden and disruptive British exit.\n\nSo they are likely to agree, although politicians in France say President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a shorter extension than the three months that Britain has asked for.\n\nMr Johnson has vowed that, sooner or later, Britain will leave the EU on the terms of the deal he negotiated with the bloc.\n\nHe said the December 12 election date would give lawmakers more time to scrutinise his bill, because Parliament would be in session until the formal campaign started on November 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf lawmakers refuse to approve his deal, Mr Johnson hopes an election will deliver a majority for his Conservative Party, enabling him more easily to deliver on his plans.\n\nNorthern Ireland on alert\n\nMeanwhile, British police and politicians have sounded alarms about what could happen in Northern Ireland under Mr Johnson's proposed Brexit deal, with the region's police chief warning that a badly handled divorce from the European Union could bring violence back onto the streets.\n\nPolice are concerned that if Britain's departure from the EU imposes a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, that could embolden Irish Republican Army splinter groups who are opposed to Northern Ireland's peace process and power-sharing government.\n\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne told the BBC that there also was potential for unrest among Northern Ireland's pro-British loyalist community. He said, depending on how Brexit unfolded, there could be \"a lot of emotion in loyalist communities and the potential for civil disorder\".\n\n\"There are a small number of people in both the loyalist and nationalist communities that are motivated by their own ideology and that have the potential to bring violence back onto the streets,\" he said.\n\nThe all-but invisible Irish border now underpins both the regional economy and the peace process that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Brexit divorce deal struck last week between Mr Johnson and the 27 other European Union countries contains measures to keep the Irish border open. But the plan has been condemned by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, an ally of Johnson's Conservatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe DUP says the agreement's proposal to keep Northern Ireland in line with EU goods and customs regulations would impose new checks and friction between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain.\n\nMr Johnson's Conservative government acknowledges that \"administrative procedures, including a declaration will be required\" on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit, but it says they would be minimal.\n\nDUP lawmaker Nigel Dodds warned that the British government risked undermining \"the political institutions and political stability in Northern Ireland by what you are doing to the unionist community\".\n\n\"Please wake up and realise what is happening here,\" he told the House of Commons. \"We need to get our heads together here and look at a way forward that can solve this problem. Don't plough ahead regardless, I urge you.\"\n\nAAP", "description": "The British PM wants an early election but the Labour Party, whose support he needs, won't agree unless 'no deal' is off the table.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6003%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_334%2C$y_10/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d71751a176e9f23a7b5909e4c6d775acad0e6e68", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
