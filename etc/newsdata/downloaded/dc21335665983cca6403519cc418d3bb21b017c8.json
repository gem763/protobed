Those rankings could change Monday morning after final tallies are reported since \u201cMaleficent 2\u2033 is close behind with $18.5 million.\n\nThe surprise (and non-consecutive) win highlights the impressive endurance of \u201cJoker,\u201d which is only the third movie this year \u2015 following Universal\u2019s \u201cGlass\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d \u2015 to secure in first place during three weekends. \u201cJoker\u201d recently became the most successful R-rated movie in history, collecting $849 million worldwide. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s gritty take on Batman\u2019s infamous nemesis has generated $277 million in North America and $571 million at the international box office.\n\nSince debuting last No. 1 to a disappointing $36 million, Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d has generated a lackluster $65 million at the domestic box office. The dark fantasy sequel continues to be a bigger player overseas, where it pulled in another $64.3 million for an international haul of $228 million. Globally, the \u201cMaleficent\u201d follow-up is nearing the $300 million mark.\n\nSTX\u2019s horror thriller \u201cCountdown\u201d had the strongest start among new offerings, placing fifth with $9 million from 2,675 venues. The PG-13 film, about a nurse who downloads an app that predicts when a person is going to die, cost $6.5 million.\n\nSony\u2019s R-rated action drama \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d launched at No. 6 with $8 million from 2,062 theaters. Directed by Deon Taylor, the $12 million film follows a rookie cop (Naomie Harris) who inadvertently captures the murder of a young drug dealer on her body cam.\n\nBehind-the-scenes turmoil appeared far more interesting than the movie itself for this weekend\u2019s final newcomer, \u201cThe Current War.\u201d The historical drama arrived in theaters two years after Harvey Weinstein premiered at the 2017 Toronto Film Festival. \u201cThe Current War\u201d was shelved and sold after sexual abuse allegations were leveled against Weinstein and his company shuttered. David Glasser, the former COO of The Weinstein Company, released the film through his 101 Studios banner. \u201cThe Current War\u201d earned a dismal $2.7 million from 1,022 screens, marking one of the lowest openings for a nationwide release. Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, \u201cThe Current War\u201d depicts a tense battle between electricity giants Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) \u2015 who teams up with Nikola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult) \u2015 as the men determine whose electrical system will power the modern world.\n\nDespite playing in half the amount of theaters, A24\u2032s \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d landed at No. 8 and beat \u201cThe Current War\u201d on box office charts. The black-and-white psychological thriller \u2015 starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe \u2015 collected $3 million from 586 locations in its second outing. \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d has made $3.6 million to date.\n\nAnother awards contender that continues to impress is Neon\u2019s \u201cParasite,\u201d a dark social satire from director Bong Joon ho. In its third frame, \u201cParasite\u201d made $1.8 million from just 189 theaters, averaging a strong $14,107 per location. To date, the movie has earned $4.1 million in North America.\n\nWarner Bros. also unveiled the Bruce Springsteen concert film \u201cWestern Stars\u201d in 532 theaters. Despite positive reviews, the documentary failed to crack the top 20, opening to $560,000. Combined with Fathom Events\u2019 preview screenings, \u201cWestern Stars\u201d has made $1 million.\n\nAlso in limited release, Saban Films and Kevin Smith\u2019s \u201cJay & Silent Bob Reboot\u201d pulled in $219,397 from 17 screens for a domestic tally of $1.5 million.\n\nMGM\u2019s animated comedy \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d came in third place with $11.7 million, boosting its domestic tally to $72.8 million and $83.9 million globally. In fourth, Sony\u2019s \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d brought in $11.6 million for a North American haul of $47 million.", "description": "\u201cJoker\u201d is only the third movie this year -- following \u201cGlass\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d -- to secure first place during three weekends.", "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", "Reuters Variety"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db6940a210000063334b365.png?cache=spiqairjoq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
