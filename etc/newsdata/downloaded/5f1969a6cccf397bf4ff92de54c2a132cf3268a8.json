Iran has responded by gradually breaching nuclear commitments made in the 2015 accord and has set an October deadline to further scale back its nuclear obligations unless the Europeans salvage the pact by shielding Tehran\u2019s economy from U.S. penalties.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of delivery,\u201d Britain, France and Germany said.\n\nTensions rose on Sept. 14 following an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran. Tehran denies responsibility, and Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition, has said it carried out the attack.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,\u201d Britain, France and Germany said.\n\nMacron has led a European push over the summer to find a compromise between the United States and Iran and wants to use the U.N. meeting as an opportunity to revive diplomacy, though his efforts have stalled in recent weeks.\n\nWhen asked about Macron\u2019s attempt to mediate, U.S. President Donald Trump said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a mediator. ... They (Iran) know who to call.\u201d\n\nThe United States will intensify pressure on Iran, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook said in New York on Monday.\n\nThe United States was seeking to address the issue through diplomacy and a multilateral effort, and there was a role for the United Nations Security Council to play, Hook said without elaborating.\n\nIn an interview with U.S. network NBC on Monday, Johnson said Trump was \u201cthe one guy who can do a better deal. ... I hope there will be a Trump deal.\u201d\n\n\u2018NOT JUST A HANDSHAKE\u2019\n\nTrump flirted with meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while both are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, but the chances appear slim.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t received any requests this time, yet, for a meeting and we have made it clear a request alone will not do the job,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told reporters in New York earlier on Monday. \u201cA negotiation has to be for a reason, for an outcome, not just for a handshake.\u201d\n\nHe said there are conditions for a meeting - Iran has demanded the United States lift sanctions - and then there could be a meeting between Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - the original parties to the nuclear deal - but there would be no bilateral meeting.\n\nSpeaking after he arrived in New York on Monday, Rouhani said Iran\u2019s message to the world \u201cis peace, stability and also we want to tell the world that the situation in the Persian Gulf is very sensitive,\u201d the state news agency IRNA reported.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Remains of the missiles which Saudi government says were used to attack an Aramco oil facility, are displayed during a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo\n\nTrump has criticized the nuclear accord, negotiated under then-U.S. President Barack Obama, for \u201csunset\u201d clauses by which some of its provisions will expire as well as for its failure to address Iran\u2019s missile programme and regional activities.\n\nA senior Gulf official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gulf countries, the United States, the Europeans and others needed to engage in \u201ccollective diplomacy\u201d to defuse tensions.\n\n\u201cThe conversation should no longer be about the JCPOA (nuclear deal) but Iran\u2019s missile programme and its regional misbehaviour, which are as important if not more important - they have the potential to hold the region to ransom,\u201d the official said.", "description": "Britain, Germany and France backed the United States and blamed Iran on Monday for an attack on Saudi oil facilities, urging Tehran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programs and regional security issues.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433067815&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1UI", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
