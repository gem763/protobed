However, such fears prove unfounded: franchise returnees will find Borderlands 3 reassuringly familiar. While the game-world and storyline are more substantial than those of its predecessors, and its gloriously distinctive comic book-style graphics crisper than ever, developer Gearbox Software has resisted the urge to mess with its basic elements.\n\nSo it still has huge, sprawling (and initially impenetrable to those new to Borderlands games) character progression and weapon-management systems, and an anarchic, Mad Max-style vibe, satisfying shooting, lashings of frat-boy humour and a cast of characters who poke fun (more relevantly than ever) at the world\u2019s narcissists, corporate raiders and authoritarians.\n\nBut Borderlands 3 does bring some new aspects to the party. Most notably, the chance to choose between four distinct types of Vault Hunters: Moze, the tank, Amara, the siren with tasty melee skills, FL4K, who takes trained beasts into combat, and Zane, who employees technology such as a hovering turret or a hologram of himself. The only problem is that you have to choose between them at the start of the game, and there\u2019s no way of switching once you\u2019re underway. They offer wildly differing, very enjoyable play styles, and the addition of an unlockable, super-hard Mayhem Mode encourages you to experiment with multiple play-throughs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Mad Max-style vibe ... Borderlands 3. Photograph: 2K Games\n\nStory-wise, Borderlands 3 offers few surprises. You\u2019re recruited by Lilith, a siren, to be the Crimson Raiders\u2019 resident Vault Hunter \u2013 essentially an indestructible killing machine \u2013 and you embark on a massive, rambling quest that takes in a host of planets (Sanctuary, the familiar Borderlands home base is now an untethered spaceship) to find the Great Vault, which holds the key to ending the corporate oppression that afflicts the galaxy. However, the dastardly Calypso Twins, having united all the bandit clans and formed alliances with various corporations are also on the trail of the Great Vault, so you\u2019re in a constant race with them.\n\nAlong the way \u2013 apart from taking out vast numbers of enemies\u2013 you regularly encounter very fine boss battles, and the introduction of planets brings some welcome, and highly imaginative, variation to the environments. Some of the bosses seem so hard when you first meet that they force you to engage on periods of RPG-style grinding for new weapons and resources \u2013 but this proves to be a pleasure rather than a chore, since the vast stock of side missions is where Gearbox decided to really let its warped imagination run riot. Here is where most of the game\u2019s biggest belly laughs are to be found.\n\nAs in previous Borderlands games, you can play cooperatively with a friend, either online or in split-screen mode, and a clever new system means that it doesn\u2019t matter whether the pair of you are at different stages of the game. This time around, there\u2019s also an end-game that kicks in once you finish the main storyline. Currently, it\u2019s a bit esoteric and focused mainly on scavenging ever-more exotic loot, but Gearbox has plans to flesh it out into something more akin to Grand Theft Auto Online.\n\nAny game as meaty as Borderlands 3 is bound to contain the odd glitch, and we found a few \u2013 but nothing sufficiently egregious to get in the way of our enjoyment. And this is a deeply enjoyable game, marrying long sequences of splendidly satisfying shooting \u2013 which ebb and flow impeccably \u2013 with deep RPG-style progression.\n\nThose new to Borderlands will find some aspects confusing at first \u2013 Borderlands 3 is minimal when it comes to tutorials \u2013 but if they persist, they will end up luxuriating in the joyous, tongue-in-cheek, comic book-influenced fun it provides. Sure, it fails to turn the franchise into something new and futuristic in gameplay terms. But why would it, when its original conception was already immaculate?", "description": "While there are some new aspects, such as a game-world that is more substantial than its predecessors, the third instalment is reassuringly familiar fun", "authors": ["Steve Boxer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bebb6ef87c1ed2055fa4bca6c4c3d99787ed263/52_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=625deecc816f245eeb6b516b2ab36e3c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
