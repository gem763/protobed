Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the American Psychological Association and the left in general for contributing to the demonization of men:\n\nViewers were confused, to say the least. People on Twitter struggled to put a finger on what Ingraham was going for with her \u201cpajama boy\u201d description:\n\nWait, so are the pajamas made up of skinny jeans and a crop top? Or is it an outfit where you simultaneously wear pajamas, skinny jeans and a crop top? Do the pajamas go under the jeans and crop top or over them? \u2014 Jeremy (@outandaboutjc1) September 19, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve worked in Hollywood.
