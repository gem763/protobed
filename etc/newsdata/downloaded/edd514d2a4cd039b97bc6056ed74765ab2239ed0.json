Before you know it, you're only 10 years out.\n\nDirk Cotton retired from a job as an engineer and executive at AOL in 2005 at 52 and lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Since retiring, he's spent his time researching and writing about retirement finance and blogging about it on his site, The Retirement Cafe.\n\nHis own experience and research have led him to suggest two things that anyone looking to retire in 10 years should do today: find a retirement planner, and adjust your asset allocation.\n\nFind a financial planner\n\n\"You should find a good retirement planner, because retirement planning is incredibly complex,\" Cotton said.\n\nGetting advice from a financial planner who specializes in retirement can make all the difference when it comes to your unique situation. Once retirement gets close, having an expert on hand is \"extremely helpful and worth the investment,\" Cotton said, based on personal experience and research.\n\n\"There's a limited number of really good retirement planners out there,\" Cotton said. \"It's worth it to start talking to them in years before you retire.\"\n\nReduce your equity allocation\n\nTen years before he retired, Cotton reduced the percentage of his assets that were tied up in the stock market. \"It was a lifesaver,\" he said.\n\n\"When you're saving for retirement \u2014 in other words, before that 10-year period begins \u2014 you should probably be somewhere in the 70% to 80% range,\" he said, referring to the percentage of assets that should be invested in stocks, rather than bonds or liquid savings.\n\nBut he suggests starting to reduce that number 10 years before you retire.\n\n\"You probably want to end up, when you retire, with somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% to 50% equity allocation,\" Cotton said.\n\nHe said that by reducing his exposure in the stock market in the 10 years before he retired, he was less affected by major events approaching and during his retirement, like the popping of the dot-com bubble and the Great Recession.\n\n\"A lot of people had 100% equities when they were saving for retirement and lost over 50% in a very short period of time,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew a lot of people who had millions in options that ended up losing it all,\" he added. \"Fortunately, I was positioned to deal with it.\"\n\nAre you retired, or planning to retire soon?
