The Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to critically ill children, also paid about $11,000 for a \u201cbat princess\u201d costume party for her.\n\nTurner was arrested Friday at a Denver-area hotel and held without bond, the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. It is not clear if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It was originally attributed to intestinal failure, according to the indictment issued Thursday and first reported Monday by KUSA-TV.\n\nHer body was exhumed last year, and an autopsy found no physical evidence of that illness or other conditions that Turner claimed the girl suffered, including seizure disorder and a buildup of fluid in cavities deep within the brain. Olivia\u2019s death is now listed as undetermined.\n\nInvestigators say Olivia had been using a feeding tube and was admitted in July 2017 to Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, where doctors said her nutrition was deficient.\n\nOne doctor told investigators that Turner wanted to withdraw all medical care and artificial feeding for her daughter because her quality of life was so bad. He said she insisted that he sign a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order for her daughter.\n\nDoctors had said Olivia wouldn\u2019t be able to survive on IV nutrition, and Turner was given the option of taking her home on hospice care, according to the indictment. Olivia died a few weeks later.\n\nSeveral doctors who were interviewed said Olivia did not have a terminal condition. The girl started getting treatment at the hospital in 2013 after moving from Texas, where Turner\u2019s husband stayed behind.\n\nThe investigation into Olivia\u2019s death began after doctors at the hospital became suspicious last year after Turner brought in her older daughter because of \u201cbone pain,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nDuring an interview, investigators said Turner spontaneously brought up Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek attention from the illness of their children or dependents and sometimes cause them injuries that require attention.\n\n\u201cThat has never been my case, like at all, whatsoever,\u201d she said in the interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, authorities separated Turner from her older daughter to see if the girl would still report the same symptoms. The daughter has not had any additional medical problems or complaints of pain since October 2018, the indictment said.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear how old the girl is or whom she lives with now.\n\nThe daughters were insured by Medicaid, and Turner is accused of fraudulently obtaining about $539,000 worth of care from the government-funded program.\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado issued a statement saying it declined to comment to avoid compromising the case.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A Colorado mother who sought donations and promoted her 7-year-old daughter's \"bucket list\" has been indicted on a murder charge.", "authors": ["Colleen Slevin"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kelly-renee-turner.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
