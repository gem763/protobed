Their title drought will never the reach the lengths of that of great rivals Liverpool.\n\nWhen Liverpool were crowned champions of England in 1990, they led United 18-7 for league titles. After the final success of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s glorious reign in 2013, it was 20-18 in United\u2019s favour.\n\nSix years have passed since then and the Old Trafford club have never threatened to add a post-Fergie Premier League title.\n\nBut that seems nothing compared to the time that has elapsed since Sir Kenny Dalglish\u2019s team were victorious, with seven other clubs sharing the spoils in the ensuing period.\n\n\u201cI am sure we will bounce back and win the league,\u201d said Solskjaer, with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cAnd I am sure it won\u2019t be 30 years until the next Premier League that we do win.\u201d\n\nThat is a rare crumb of comfort at the moment for those with United in their hearts, as sitting 15 points below Jurgen Klopp\u2019s reigning European Champions in the table after only eight games is something unpalatable.", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is wise enough to know that Manchester United are enduring one of their most difficult periods in modern times.", "authors": ["Adam Lanigan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213378716-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDhV2K8uQsCbKQWf5axWl7uXxpTrLPlQIEbLNUz7XbOY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
