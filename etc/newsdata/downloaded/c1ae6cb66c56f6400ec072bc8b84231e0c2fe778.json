We certainly have not won the war against ISIS. We\u2019ve made gains, and if you release 10,000 of them, that\u2019s incredible. And you think about the message this is sending to our Kurdish allies. \u2026 And when I hear Rand Paul, for instance, say things like, well, we only have 300 or 400 people there, the best people to do it are the ones on the ground. That\u2019s exactly what the 300 or 400 people\u2019s job is is to empower indigenous forces, locals to fight their own battle. This is exactly the kind of fight that people like Rand Paul actually said he wanted to do instead of 200,000 troops.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's \"The Story,\" Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) reacted to President Trump's decision to withdraw troops | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/Kinzinger-824-Thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
