Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019 Report\n\nWhat is Bolton saying?\n\nMoments after Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Bolton took to Twitter to offer a different version of events.\n\nHe maintained he had actually offered his resignation, but Mr Trump told him \"let's talk about it tomorrow\".\n\nAs the news broke, Mr Bolton texted a Fox News host live on TV to insist he had resigned as national security adviser.\n\nHe also texted Washington Post reporter Robert Costa that \"I will have my say in due course\" and \"my sole concern is US national security\".\n\nThe dismissal came as a surprise. Just two hours before his departure was announced, Mr Bolton had been due to host a White House briefing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe new acting national security adviser will be Charles Kupperman, who was a deputy to Mr Bolton, the White House told the BBC.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responds to John Bolton firing\n\nWhat are White House sources saying?\n\nSources said that the National Security Council, which advises the president, had become a separate entity within the White House under Mr Bolton.\n\nA former senior Trump administration official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC: \"He [Bolton] operates separately from the rest of the White House.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Mr Bolton did not attend meetings, and followed his own initiatives.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA White House official told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. \"Bolton has his priorities. He didn't ask the president 'What are your priorities?' They're Bolton's priorities.\"\n\nA former senior administration official told CBS that Mr Bolton's \"his way or the highway\" approach infuriated many people inside the White House, including the president.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaking in May 2019, Trump said \u201cI actually temper\u201d John Bolton\n\nIn the lead-up to Mr Bolton's firing, Mr Trump reportedly reached out to his predecessor, HR McMaster, NBC News reports.\n\nThe president told the retired general he missed him and asked his advice on national security issues, two anonymous sources familiar with the conversations told NBC.\n\nAn untenable situation\n\nJohn Bolton was always an unusual fit in the Trump White House. While he was an animated personality on Fox News - clearly endearing him to the president - he was also an outspoken foreign policy hawk working for a man who campaigned against international adventurism.\n\nMr Bolton was a strong supporter of the Iraq War, for instance, while the president has called the conflict one of the greatest US military blunders.\n\nOn topics like North Korea and Russia, the president's conciliatory position when Mr Bolton arrived in April 2018 was clear - and clearly contrary to the long-time foreign policy hand. Add disagreements on Afghanistan negotiations and Iran confrontation, and it created an untenable situation.\n\nMr Trump's third national security adviser in as many years has been on the outs for some time. He did not join the president at a key meeting with Kim Jong-un, and phoned-in his objections to a Camp David event with the Taliban while in Poland last week.\n\nThere appears to be disagreement over whether Mr Bolton was fired or resigned. One way or another, a change was coming - even if just yesterday, Mr Trump had tweeted that reports of \"turmoil in the White House\" were created by the \"Dishonest Media\".\n\nHow did Trump and Bolton disagree?\n\nMr Bolton, a leading foreign policy hawk, was the chief architect of Mr Trump's hard-line stance against Iran.\n\nBut he had reportedly opposed the president's recent suggestion that he was willing to talk to Tehran's leaders.\n\nThe former national security adviser had also advocated for a much tougher stance on North Korea, Russia and Afghanistan.\n\nMr Bolton was blamed by US officials for the collapse of a summit in February between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam by putting forward a list of uncompromising demands that Pyongyang rejected.\n\nMr Bolton opposed peace talks with the Taliban, which Mr Trump scrapped at the weekend after inviting the group to the US.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy magazine, Mr Bolton had argued that inviting a US-designated terror group to Camp David - the presidential retreat outside Washington - would \"set a terrible precedent\".\n\nMr Bolton had a reputation as a warmonger, and Mr Trump once reportedly joked in an Oval Office meeting that \"John has never seen a war he doesn't like\".\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Trump was reportedly angry with the failure of US policy in Venezuela, complaining that Mr Bolton had misled him about how easy it would be to replace President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has clung to power.", "description": "President Trump says he disagreed with many of the US national security adviser's suggestions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/66CA/production/_108741362_bolton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
