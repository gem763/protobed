This week, we\u2019re featuring alternative dance group R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL.\n\nAustralian trio R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL makes the kind of music that slowly picks away at your heart. Comprised of Tyrone Lindqvist, Jon George, and James Hunt, the group\u2019s songs build in layers, with each otherworldly, wistful element creeping in and guiding you, transforming the three from a band into temporary shamans.\n\nAlthough R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL as a group has been around since 2010, they\u2019ve only carried this moniker for about a year. Previously, they were known simply as R\u00dcF\u00dcS, but had to change the group\u2019s name stateside because of an existing US trademark \u2014 Chaka Khan\u2019s funk band laid claim to the Rufus title in America decades ago. As the trio said in a Facebook post at the time: \u201cTrademark is a serious bitch.\u201d\n\nThe change was needed, as their music\u2019s knack for invoking intimacy has endeared them to international audiences. They now have multiple albums, EPs, and award nominations that see them currently on tour, hitting everywhere from Chicago\u2019s Lollapalooza to Colorado\u2019s famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre. They\u2019ll also be at Coachella, debuting a special short film to accompany their single \u201cUnderwater\u201d \u2014 projecting it in HP\u2019s 360-degree, 11,000-square-foot Antarctic Dome.\n\nStopping by The Verge ahead of Coachella, R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL emptied out their bags, giving a peek at how to stay centered when they\u2019re constantly performing, and a life of planes, trains, and automobiles shakes up any sense of stability. For all, self-care is key and is a trait that presents itself with each band member in both expected and completely surprising ways.\n\nHey, it\u2019s Jon here with the brown bag.\n\nI\u2019ve got my MacBook Pro laptop, which I take everywhere. We make edits on it for DJ sets and mock together little things for our live show. And I\u2019ve got this Jackery power pack \u2014 it lasts so long and charges things like headphones several times over.\n\nDo you feel like you can do most of your work on the road?\n\nYeah. We write everything on just a laptop, and then the possibilities are endless from there, whether we have a full studio with synths all connected up, or are just in headphones, editing on the road and messing around with different sounds. We use Ableton to work on our laptops.\n\nSpeaking of headphones, I see you\u2019ve got some Bose.\n\nYeah, the QC35s. They\u2019re so good. I just flew from LA and I had them on the whole time with no music. And also I\u2019ve got this silk eye mask, which is key.\n\nYou have to get your beauty rest where you can!\n\nThis is a good combo \u2014 the Bluetooth headphones, silk eye mask, and then this humidifier for planes. When you\u2019re flying, they don\u2019t push out all the oxygen that you should be getting. They just recirculate the air and it insanely dries you out. So, this helps keep the air moist with a filter. It\u2019s supposed to be very good for singers and for jet lag.\n\nDo you notice a difference when you use it?\n\nOh, yeah. Particularly on long-haul flights. If we\u2019re going to sleep for eight hours, I just chuck that on and definitely feel a lot better. You\u2019re not crusty.\n\nDo you all have one of these humidifier things?\n\nTyrone: Yes, I didn\u2019t bring mine, though!\n\nDoes anybody look over when you\u2019re flying and think \u201cOh my god, my oxygen mask didn\u2019t drop down\u201d?\n\nJon: Exactly! And that I look like a monster with everything on. Very Darth Vader. Very scary.\n\nThere are more headphones here.\n\nI actually carry two pairs of headphones. The Sennheiser HD 25s are for mixing and playing around with music, and the other\u2019s for leisure. The Sennheisers are top-of-the-range DJ headphones I guess you would say. And they\u2019re good as all-around audio engineering headphones. I\u2019ve gone through several pairs of these. They\u2019re so good in the club and we\u2019re just used to the way that they represent bass. I know exactly how that music\u2019s going to sound on different systems.\n\nNo earbuds?\n\nYes, I also have Bose SoundSport earbuds. And then there are in-ears. Oh my gosh, there are so many headphones. These in-ears are molded specifically to my ears by Jerry Harvey Audio.\n\nJames: They\u2019re for shows, but we always forget them.\n\nAnd they attenuate a lot \u2014 that\u2019s the amount of volume they reduce. I think we picked a pretty extreme version.\n\nI also have another little tech bag inside of my bag. It\u2019s got a headphone splitter, a jack to jack cable, and USBs for DJing. That five-way splitter is especially good for when we\u2019re editing tracks together on planes. Then my girlfriend packed me this other little bag before I left. It\u2019s got a bunch of little knickknacks in it.\n\nOkay, and we\u2019ve got sunglasses and a sweatshirt.\n\nYeah, you need a nice, cozy jumper.\n\nWhy did you change the band name from R\u00dcF\u00dcS to R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL?\n\nOnce we started touring internationally we realized we had to change the name in America for a number of reasons, some of which are boring. Once we realized that, we added DU SOL on, which means of the sun \u2014 and different variations of that \u2014 in many languages. DU SOL is like its own little planet.\n\nTell me about your bag.\n\nJames: Well, I\u2019ve had a few Burton bags for most of my touring life, and they\u2019re awesome. It\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t have one with me now. I think on the last tour I spilled some shit in my bag and ended up having to jettison that Burton bag. I maybe grabbed this one from Ross on the way to the airport or something. Ross has got the goods. Nice and simple. But Burton bags are the way to go.\n\nThis backpack\u2019s really good for compartmentalizing things, which helps. It\u2019s a North Face Access Pack. I\u2019ve had this for two years now. It\u2019s been toured pretty hard and it still is in really good shape.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the hard drives.\n\nThey\u2019re Seagate and LaCie drives. Some of these are my personal hard drives and some are R\u00dcF\u00dcS backup hard drives. Our entire album is backed up on these as well as all of our sample packs that we\u2019ve amassed. While we were writing the album, we generated a lot of data just from sound effects. We would run found sounds through all the plug-ins that we acquired. All these recordings chewed up a lot of space, so we had to keep offloading.\n\nDo you make all your own samples?\n\nWe download some samples from the internet, but we record a lot in the studio. We basically built this little playground with a bunch of synthesizers we had wanted to get for a while. There\u2019s a lot of amazing-sounding analog synths as well as a bunch of different microphones set up. We would record different sounds, like ripping a prawn cracker apart, then slow it down and put it through a bunch of delays. We\u2019d sit there for an hour and just tweak the different parameters on the plug-ins to make crazy effects. We\u2019d only use maybe two seconds of that in a song, but it might be a really interesting moment. We definitely did a lot more of that on this record \u2014 letting things run and seeing where it took us. So the excess of all that is on these drives.\n\nJon: It took up so much storage.\n\nJames: Yeah, because we were recording at 96kHz. Really high fidelity. Probably unnecessarily so. I also think that on one of these hard drives I have all my files from since I was 15. For some reason I\u2019ve hoarded all my computers.\n\nAnything special about your wallet?\n\nIt\u2019s a passport wallet, which is very essential. I\u2019ve recently lost a passport mid-tour. It was the biggest nightmare of my life. So now I\u2019m keeping the passport compartmentalized at all times.\n\nWhere did you lose it?\n\nOn some flight. I think it was after a Las Vegas show, which makes a lot of sense. Never recovered it.\n\nWhat phone do you use?\n\nThis phone is an iPhone 7 or 8. That\u2019s my spare phone.\n\nTyrone: Spare phone?\n\nJames: Yeah, I\u2019ve got a spare phone just in case! The Wi-Fi receiver stopped working on it and then I decided to get a new phone. So, I have an iPhone X as well. I have some dongles, USBs, and then the AirPods \u2014 they\u2019re really good for picking up audio if we\u2019re doing interviews via FaceTime.\n\nAnd your computer?\n\nI have a 15-inch MacBook, which is good because I\u2019ve been doing some Photoshop \u2014 poster design, graphic design \u2014 so I like the bigger screen.\n\nI see the same headphones here.\n\nI also have the Sennheiser HD 25s and the Bose QC35s. All three of us have them. The Bose headphones are so comfortable and the noise canceling is key. I sleep with them on most nights, actually. They cancel out all the ambient noise in my apartment or noise from the air conditioning and whatever.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Body High sticker?\n\nIt\u2019s a dance label. I really like the design of it and their music.\n\nAnd these bottles?\n\nThis is a very relaxing essential oil. You rub a bit of it on your palms and you take it in. I find it very calming. Helps me feel grounded. The Noir is a little travel-sized cologne, and Kiehl\u2019s face moisturizer keeps you soft.\n\nI see crystals here! And it\u2019s a Burton bag.\n\nTyrone: Yes. All of our big bags and our small travel bags that we travel with are Burton. This one\u2019s been around for ages. I think I\u2019ve had this one for four years. I\u2019ve had other backpacks, but I came back to this one.\n\nTell me about the stones.\n\nI keep the stones in a side pocket. There\u2019s a purple amethyst, a shell my girlfriend found, and a heart rock. My girlfriend\u2019s a therapist and she gives heart rocks to her patients. She works with patients for eight weeks and then she chooses a rock. For me, it\u2019s a grounding thing if I\u2019m stressed out or we\u2019re bouncing around on tour. I usually take this onstage and play with it in my back pocket. During \u201cInnerbloom\u201d I usually grab it, because I get a chance to stand back and take it all in. So, it\u2019s pretty special.\n\nWhat about the amethyst?\n\nI\u2019ve been sober for several months. A close friend of ours has been sober for a few years and she gave the purple amethyst to me as a sobriety stone.\n\nWhat are Yogapaws?\n\nThose were a gift from my girlfriend as well. They\u2019re for your feet and hands and makes it so you can stick on any surface, like carpet or concrete. This way you don\u2019t have to take an entire mat with you. I\u2019ve been doing yoga for a little more than a year. It\u2019s hard to have any form of structural stability because we\u2019re on the road so much. Having these makes it easier to do yoga anywhere. I\u2019ve used them in green rooms before a show. I find it\u2019s really helpful in terms of singing and performing. When we\u2019re going from city to city, yoga is the one thing that can center me a little bit.\n\nAnd here are the headphones! What do you like about them?\n\nWhen we were mixing the new record, we\u2019d switch between the Sennheisers and the Bose, just as points of reference when we were giving feedback. I find the Bose have a woofier low end so it\u2019s really present, but it isn\u2019t as punchy as the Sennheisers. The Sennheisers have a boost in the frequency range that\u2019s good for DJs so things like snares poke through. They\u2019re great-sounding headphones, but it\u2019s more that we know them really well.\n\nAnd if all of you use them then you\u2019re hearing the same thing.\n\nExactly. Sometimes if we\u2019re on tour and we\u2019re giving feedback, we don\u2019t have the luxury of being in the same room and knowing that room and knowing the speakers. So, these are our points of reference.\n\nWhat do you use the journal for?\n\nThis is a lyric book. I doodle and write whatever I want. Here\u2019s the lyrics for \u201cUnderwater.\u201d\n\nAnd an actual, physical book!\n\nThe book was another gift from my girlfriend! She gives good gifts. It\u2019s a really nice read, but I haven\u2019t finished it yet. Moving to LA was a bit of a strange process with finding my feet. You say bye to your family and friends and then it\u2019s like a washing machine of ego. Music was definitely one of the only things keeping me somewhat upright. So, this has been a really helpful book. I can be hard on myself sometimes.\n\nYou have a spare outfit with you?\n\nI always travel with two pairs of undies because after a show, or if we have a DJ set, I don\u2019t really know specifically what\u2019s going to happen every day. And there was a time on a tour when my full suitcase, which is basically my home when you\u2019re on the road for two, three months, with my rings, my hard drives, everything, disappeared. I had one pair of undies. My bag never came back. It sucked. There was a camera in there and two GoPros. Usually I have a spare shirt as well. This is a Royal Blood shirt. Sick band. They\u2019re probably my favorite rock band around. Them or Foals.\n\nThe cologne is Santal 33. We first smelled that in New York playing a show here. It\u2019s pretty delicious. My face gets dry when we fly, so I have this Aesop cream.\n\nAnd your laptop?\n\nMy computer is the same as the guys\u2019. We do all our production on there and edits. I\u2019ve been getting vocal lessons recently so I record them all on there. The coach\u2019s name is Ron Anderson. He\u2019s a legend. He\u2019s worked with a lot of people. It\u2019s been really cool to learn about my voice.\n\nWhat\u2019s improving?\n\nI think I developed some bad habits on tour, being unwell and pushing through a lot of shows. It\u2019s kind of like going back to school learning your ABCs. It\u2019s a slow process.\n\nI try to take better care of myself. I have two pairs of earplugs. I\u2019m really worried about my hearing. It\u2019s just hard to hear a lot because they\u2019re so good. They block out I think 30 to 50db. That\u2019s quite a lot. We use them when we play live so we can listen to what we want without hearing the whole room and audience and sound. We have a bit more control.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
