He may make some concessions. But under current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.\u201d\n\nThough Bolton didn't mention Trump by name, his views were contrary to the president's strategy in trying to broker a nuclear deal with the rogue state. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have repeatedly, with Trump claiming each meeting a success and talking up his relationship with Kim.\n\nTrump said he fired Bolton earlier this month over policy disagreements and clashes with other administration officials. Trump said Bolton's views had set the U.S. back \"very badly\" in talks. For his part, Bolton said he first offered to resign.\n\nUpon Bolton's abrupt departure from the White House, Trump blasted his former national security adviser's \"Libya model,\" which saw that country give up its nuclear weapons in 2003 in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi was eventually toppled and died in 2011.\n\nDENNIS RODMAN MAKES BOLD PREDICTION ABOUT KIM JONG UN ON 'FOX & FRIENDS'\n\n\u201cIt may be the Libya model is not possible,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cBut what I regard as even worse, in a way, is pretending that you\u2019re getting to a resolution of the nuclear issue when you simply allow North Korea still to have a nuclear capability but give it enough economic assistance \u2026 that gives the regime a lifeline it currently doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean officials expressed anger at Bolton's Libya comments, with many in North Korea arguing that nuclear weapons are essential for survival.\n\nTalks between American and North Korean officials have stalled since Trump and Kim walked away from their second summit in February. Kim wanted sanctions relief in exchange for partial disarmament.\n\nIn the several months since, North Korea has run several short-range missile tests. Trump has largely downplayed the tests, saying they haven't violated any agreements.\n\nOn Monday, Bolton said American officials should focus on taking a tougher approach with North Korea, not \"can we get another summit with Kim Jong Un, or what the state of staff-level negotiations are to achieve a commitment from North Korea it will never honor.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Bolton said the U.S. should think about a possible regime change and working with China toward the reunification of the two Koreas.\n\n\"If you believe ... that it is unacceptable for North Korea to have nuclear weapons, at some point military force has to be an option,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBolton is well known for his hawkish stance on foreign policy and is an advocate for U.S. intervention abroad against Washington's adversaries.\n\nAt the start of his speech, he alluded to North Korea's dislike of his views.\n\n\"I'm also sure that the leadership of North Korea is delighted that I'm here today in a private capacity,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "John Bolton gave his \"unvarnished\" thoughts on the Trump administration's North Korea strategy Monday in his first speech since his abrupt split with the White House.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/ContentBroker_contentid-c2ba02b93b5d411db1611f46e76c72c8.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
