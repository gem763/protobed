These inspirations are featured in Downtown 81, the film by writer and Interview founder Glenn O\u2019Brien, shot by Swiss photographer Edo Bertoglio and starring Basquiat himself. The movie, which first premiered at Cannes in 2000, will return to New York City\u2019s Metrograph on October 25 in a run co-sponsored by Vulture, before receiving a national rerelease by Metrograph Pictures. A so-called \u201cfairy tale\u201d about an artist encountering other Manhattan bohemians as he struggles to make a living painting, Downtown 81 also features Blondie front woman Debbie Harry, Latin disco group Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Mudd Club owner Steve Mass.\n\nRelated", "description": "Metrograph Pictures and Vulture will partner to show the 1981 film Downtown 81, a story of a new music scene in New York starring artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/03-downtown-81-basquiat.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
