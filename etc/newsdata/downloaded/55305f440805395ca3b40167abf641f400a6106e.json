John Cornyn\u2019s RESPONSE Act unveiled this week. The source was careful to point out, however, that the White House has not endorsed the Cornyn proposal, and may not be on board with all of the provisions.\n\nGun control was pushed to the sidelines as Democrats kicked off their impeachment campaign, though one industry figure believes it was Beto O\u2019Rourke and his push to ban and confiscate so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d that scuttled the discussions between the White House and gun control supporters in Congress, not the impeachment proceedings themselves.\n\nThe news that the White House won\u2019t support any new gun control measures will almost certainly have an impact on Capitol Hill, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will only bring up legislation that the president is willing to sign. If the president is no longer willing to sign a red flag law or some expansion to the current background requirements, we\u2019re not likely to see a vote held at all. That will infuriate gun control activists, who are already planning on spending millions of dollars to unseat the Senate majority leader next November.\n\nGun owners are a key constituency in the Trump re-election coalition, so perhaps it\u2019s just good politics to stay on the good side of Second Amendment supporters and not endorse any gun control proposals. Still, according to one industry insider, the president wants to do something \u201cthat will save lives,\u201d and has decided that focusing on mental health is the better way to go. Considering the rise in suicide rates, including non-firearm related suicides, that\u2019s a pretty good idea.\n\nAccording to one source familiar with one conversation between White House officials and a Second Amendment advocate, the officials didn\u2019t get into specific mental health proposals, but a key point seems to be improving access to treatment, both in-patient and out-patient care. President Trump has talked about his desire to open new mental health hospitals but hasn\u2019t said how many new hospitals he\u2019d like to see, or where the money would come from to pay for construction and staffing. Gun control activists, meanwhile, have complained that focusing on mental health instead of gun bans, \u201cred flag\u201d laws, and background check bills won\u2019t do anything to address the issue of active assailant attacks and gun-related violence.\n\nI think it\u2019s a wise move for the president to back away from the gun control policies he\u2019d previously expressed support for, both politically and from a policy perspective. I look forward to hearing mental health proposals from the president in the near future, but I\u2019d also encourage the White House to take a look at some other policies to address violent crime, including the expansion of the Project Ceasefire programs currently funded by the Department of Justice. There are several great ideas on how to reduce violent crime without trying to ban or arrest our way to safety, and that\u2019s one that\u2019s deserving of presidential attention and support.", "description": "The White House has been letting Second Amendment groups and high-level supporters know the president wants to pursue mental health instead of gun control.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/291/ebf31651-2100-49af-8278-8eec6ee83cd0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
