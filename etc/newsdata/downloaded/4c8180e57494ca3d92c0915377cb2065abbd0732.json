He was cleared of the murder and manslaughter of Yousef, who wanted to be a heart surgeon, but he was jailed for other offences.\n\nMolnar\u2019s family have now hired a leading publicity firm and given an interview to The Sunday Times, describing him as \u2018a normal, typical teenage lad\u2019 and a \u2018fabulously creative chef\u2019.\n\nThey said their son was \u2018incredibly remorseful\u2019 about the \u2018tragedy\u2019 \u2013 but then praised his talents and character, and took the opportunity to contradict evidence presented in court.\n\nJoshua Molnar (pictured left with mother Stephanie Molnar) was cleared of the murder and manslaughter of Yousef after he claimed that he acted in self-defense when he stabbed him. He has been identified for the first time in a Sunday Times interview where the Molnar family said their son was \u2018incredibly remorseful\u2019 about the \u2018tragedy\u2019 \u2013 but then praised his talents\n\nThe interview came ahead of his 18th birthday tomorrow, when he can officially be named \u2013 the newspaper won the agreement of both Molnar and the courts to identify him before his birthday.\n\nHe is the son of Mark Molnar, 56, a business consultant and former chairman of Cheshire Lawn Tennis Association, and Stephanie Molnar, 51, who co-founded a chain of private children\u2019s nurseries.\n\nYousef's mother Debbie Makki and sister Jade appeared on GMB and said he was 'far from' the 'gangster' he was described as in his trial. She has since said the Molnar's 'seem to be more worried about tainting their reputations' as the family were published in the Sunday Times\n\nMr Molnar is honorary secretary of Cheshire LTA, while his wife has stood down from her business, the Elmscot Group, which built up a portfolio of 14 nurseries employing 225 staff to look after 1,700 children in the North West.\n\nJoshua, who was sent to a several prestigious schools, grew up in the family\u2019s \u00a31million home in Hale, Cheshire \u2013 but more recently split his time between his parents\u2019 homes after they separated.\n\nThe Molnars are being represented by Manchester PR agency MC2 Communications, which would normally cost thousands of pounds. Its past clients include Cadbury\u2019s owner Mondelez.\n\nFighting back tears, Ms Makki said her son was a 'very popular boy' and added the family would fight for justice for him 'as long as they were alive', in July. And she has now said 'we have never seen a shred of true remorse' from the Molnar family\n\nJoshua was cleared of the murder and manslaughter of his 'good friend' following a four-week trial at Manchester Crown Court in July (pictured)\n\nYesterday, they were accused of going on a \u2018PR offensive\u2019 by relatives of Yousef, 17, a scholarship pupil at the \u00a313,000-a-year Manchester Grammar School who was being prepared for Oxbridge.\n\nYousef\u2019s mother Debbie Makki, 54, said: \u2018Who do the Molnars think they are having a publicist? They\u2019re hardly Posh and Becks. They are shameless. They have shown no remorse to us during or since the trial. We\u2019ve never heard anything from them. Surely, as human beings they should sympathise with us losing such a huge part of our lives. Instead, they seem to be more worried about tainting their reputations.\u2019\n\nMrs Makki and daughter Jade Akoum, 28, said they would be \u2018exploring all avenues to ensure justice for Yousef\u2019. They added: \u2018We have never seen a shred of true remorse.\u2019 Mrs Akoum said: \u2018They can have all the money in the world and use a PR company but they can\u2019t change the fact their son killed Yousef and was troubled.\u2019 She described Joshua as the \u2018scum of the earth\u2019.\n\nThe Makki family, from Burnage, Manchester, are considering a private claim in the civil courts.\n\nMolnar was cleared of cleared of conspiracy to rob and sentenced to a 16-month detention training order \u2013 12 months for perverting the course of justice, and four months for possession of the knife. And Yousef's mother Debbi Makki has called the family 'shameless' for their interview in The Sunday Times\n\nYousef suffered a 5.5-inch wound through the heart after being stabbed with an illegal flick knife during the confrontation on March 2 this year in Hale Barns, a Cheshire village popular with company directors and footballers.\n\nThe trial of Molnar and another 17-year-old youth, known as Boy B, heard that they and Yousef were friends but had fallen out over a botched attempt to rob a drug dealer. Molnar was allegedly furious after he was beaten up and his \u00a32,000 carbon-fibre mountain bike \u2013 a gift from his father \u2013 was thrown over a hedge.\n\nThe knife used by Molnar was bought online by Boy B. During the trial at Manchester Crown Court in the summer, Molnar claimed the stabbing happened after Yousef pulled a knife on him. The prosecution said there was no evidence Yousef had a knife.\n\nMolnar was also cleared of conspiracy to rob, but was given a 16-month detention order after admitting possessing an offensive weapon and perverting the course of justice by lying to police.\n\nBoy B was cleared of conspiracy to rob and perverting the course of justice, but admitted possessing an offensive weapon and was locked up for four months.\n\nThe Molnars have told how their son had \u2018normal friendship groups\u2019 from school and his home town, and was a talented rugby union player.\n\nIn a statement, Mrs Molnar said: \u2018The events of that night were a tragedy. I cannot imagine what Yousef\u2019s parents and family must be going through. [He] fully accepts responsibility for Yousef\u2019s death in the act of self-defence. He will have to live with the responsibility for the rest of his life.\u2019", "description": "Yousef Makki's mother Debbi Makki has blasted Joshua Molnar's family as 'shameless' since Sunday Times interview.
