The more comfortable on-the-go experience is so good that, even if you already own the mobile-capable Switch, you should consider picking up a \u201cLite.\u201d And the price is right.\n\nI\u2019ve played every iteration of Nintendo\u2019s handhelds, even the Game and Watch series (my first video game ever was \u201cGreenhouse\u201d). All of them, even the beloved DS series, were never known for their comfort. Devices would be too thick, too thin, too tall, too heavy. The dual screens of the DS made them feel top heavy. Hand cramps became an acceptable strain. Only two other devices even approached this level of comfort: the Game Boy Advance and Sony\u2019s PlayStation Vita, but neither knows the human hand as well as the Switch Lite.\n\nAs a reference point for comfort, I am 6 feet tall and have fairly large hands. As a guitar player for more than two decades, my fingers can comfortably stretch across a fret board.\n\nAfter the Wii U, Nintendo\u2019s failed first attempt at a hybrid tablet-console machine, the Switch was Apollo 2. Nintendo beat the skeptics in 2017, quickly selling as fast and sometimes faster than Sony\u2019s more powerful PlayStation 4. The Switch Lite, which releases Friday, is not only just another iteration of the Switch, but also a successor to its DS series.\n\nMeet the queer, non-binary, pansexual characters of Borderlands 3\n\nThe Switch entered the market as a console, but since then has been accepted and considered by many as a handheld device, especially considering roughly half of Switch users play in handheld fashion (vs. \u201cdocked\u201d and tethered to your TV). With the Lite, there\u2019s no \u201cswitch\u201d to connect to a TV. The detachable controllers are gone (though you can connect them to the device for more players).\n\nThis time, the directional pad makes its official triumphant return, feeling about as good as Nintendo\u2019s already excellent Pro Controller for the Switch. The other buttons mimic that feeling: a stronger but quieter click. More travel time for the buttons gives you more confidence with each press.\n\nNintendo wisely matched the bezel of the screen to each of the system\u2019s three color offerings: gray, turquoise and yellow. Even though the screen is smaller (5.5 inches vs. the 6.2 on a normal console), the bezel doesn\u2019t overshadow it. The old Switch looks like a flat-screen CRT compared to the Lite.\n\nThe 720p output is same resolution as the handheld version of the Switch. But because of the smaller screen, more pixel density results in a crisper looking image, even if it\u2019s the same thing. One thing to look out for: Be wary of games with heavy reading. Text was already a struggle to read on the Switch\u2019s handheld mode, and it\u2019s worse on the smaller screen. Most developers have been designing fonts optimized for a smaller screen, but older games not updated will suffer.\n\nAlso be wary of the speakers, which are now mostly located at the bottom of the system, as opposed to only the back. Covering the bottom \u2014 by, say, resting the unit on your stomach \u2014 will muffle sound. But because the Switch Lite weighs at a sprite 0.66 lbs., you probably won\u2019t be covering the speakers with the bottom of your palms. You could lie in bed and hold the system for hours without tiring. The built-in speakers sound a bit lighter than the original console, but you\u2019re better off using headphones anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s also become far more sensible as a pocket device. We still wouldn\u2019t recommend it, but the option is there. It actually looks like it makes sense in a back pocket.\n\nThe Switch\u2019s kickstand is also gone, which is good since it was the biggest design flaw in the original system. I\u2019ve also never seen it used outside of my own home.\n\nLinking accounts is easy. Just punch in your Nintendo ID account and password, and you could access your downloaded games, backed-up save data from the cloud and all your original options.\n\nAn important note for people buying their second Switch: Only the \u201cprimary\u201d Switch for the account can play games without the Internet. Every additional Switch needs to check in online before starting up a game. It makes sense, then, for multiple Switch owners to designate the Lite as their primary. Keep your console in its dock at home, bathed in WiFi. Nintendo has guides online on how to link your accounts, and deregister the primary console to make the, ahem, switch.\n\nEach system only comes with 32 gigabytes of storage, same as the old system, so if you\u2019re going to be downloading games, you\u2019ll need a micro SD card to bolster your capacity. It\u2019s a shame the console doesn\u2019t come with more storage, but Nintendo seems more eager to get both Switches in people\u2019s hands at an affordable price. Still, options would be nice.\n\nVideo game loot boxes are going away, and it could crush Rocket League's black market\n\nNintendo says you\u2019ll get about half an hour more in battery life than the original 2.5 to 6.5 hours, and our testing shows that tracks. I played graphics- and CPU-intensive games like Fortnite, and Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus. After about two hours, I was down to 50% battery life, which I would usually hit at about an hour and a half in my regular launch console. You\u2019ll still need to keep a charger handy if you\u2019re going to be away for a long stretch.\n\nPlaying Fortnite and Wolfenstein also helped me realize this is a far more viable way to play more intense games on handheld than the old Switch. Because of the detachable controllers, I always felt I was one game away from breaking the thing apart. But with the Lite, it feels as sturdy as an iPad. The form factor is taut, with fewer screws and a more unifying design.\n\nThat\u2019s another thing the Lite reveals: Remove the \u201cgimmick\u201d of the Switch and you\u2019re left with pound for pound one of the best gaming consoles ever released. Stacked with titles like Doom, Dark Souls and, soon, The Witcher 3, along with its own first-party Mario and Zelda titles, Nintendo can proudly boast an S-tier library early in the system\u2019s life.\n\nSo who is this for? There are the Switch holdouts, for whom the original $300 price tag might\u2019ve been too much for a system that\u2019s not nearly as powerful as Microsoft and Sony\u2019s platforms. Nintendo is among the stingiest corporations when it comes to depreciating its own products\u2019 prices, so a $100 drop is a rare concession. Handheld enthusiasts will need this milestone in mobile design.\n\nNintendo nerds will naturally eat this up, including myself. Curiously, the colors aren\u2019t exactly crowd pleasers. Some folks might hold out for more nostalgic colors (where is Game Boy Advance purple?!), while other skeptics might wait for inevitable future updates. Nintendo and Apple share similar tactics when it comes to updating their devices, and don\u2019t be surprised if some ludicrously named Switch Lite XL Pro is released in a few years.\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll just have to settle for Nintendo\u2019s second consecutive hardware home run.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nHow a video game is getting players to rethink Brexit\n\n\u2018Gears 5\u2019: The definition of a great action game\n\n\u2018Control\u2019: A space-warping science fiction game with much to like but not a lot to love\n\n\u2018Telling Lies\u2019: One of the most best video games of the year\n\n\u2018Observation\u2019: A brilliant science fiction game that puts the player in an unfamiliar situation", "description": "Comfortable and capable, the Switch Lite is the definitive Nintendo handheld device.", "authors": ["Gene Park", "Audience Editor"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LNPH2AG2LAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
