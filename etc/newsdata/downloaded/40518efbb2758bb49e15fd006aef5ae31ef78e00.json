The song\u2019s lyrics don\u2019t allude to the disease which would claim the singer\u2019s life seven years later, but it\u2019s possible that its title could be a thinly-veiled reference. \u201cEverything was about subtext with Freddie Mercury,\u201d says Martin Aston, author of Breaking Down The Walls Of Heartache: How Music Came Out.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\n- The hardest place to be a popstar\n\n- Is the era of Taylor Swift over?\n\nLove Kills is included on Never Boring, a new box set gathering much of the material Mercury recorded away from Queen, including his only solo album, 1985\u2019s Mr Bad Guy, and 1988\u2019s Barcelona, an ambitious LP collaboration with opera singer Montserrat Caball\u00e9. The release offers a timely opportunity to explore Mercury\u2019s complex identity and status as a queer icon, especially since last year\u2019s enormously successful biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody, was accused of playing down, or \u2018straightwashing\u2019, the singer\u2019s relationships with men.\n\nI've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further \u2013 Freddie Mercury\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how Mercury might have defined his sexuality because, in public at least, he never quite addressed it head on. In his lifetime, British newspaper The Sun branded the singer a \u201cbisexual rock star\u201d, and in recent years the media has frequently referred to him as gay. But when music magazine NME asked Mercury in 1974, \u201cSo how about being bent?\u201d Mercury replied: \u201cYou\u2019re a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were times when I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I\u2019m not going to elaborate further.\u201d On another occasion, he answered a similar question by saying playfully: \u201cI\u2019m as gay as a daffodil, my dear!\u201d\n\nThough Mercury was living with Jim Hutton, his male partner of six years, at the time of his death, he bequeathed the lion\u2019s share of his estate to Mary Austin, a woman he dated for a similar length of time in the \u201870s and remained close to. Austin still lives at Garden Lodge, a Georgian mansion in Kensington where Mercury spent his final years. She rarely gives interviews, but told the Daily Mail in 2013 that Mercury said before he died: \u201cIf things had been different, you would have been my wife and this would have been yours anyway.\u201d\n\nA new identity\n\nMercury\u2019s sexuality isn\u2019t the only aspect of his identity that\u2019s complicated. In 1946, he was born Farrokh Bulsara to Indian Parsi parents on the island of Zanzibar, then a British protectorate and now part of Tanzania. He attended British-style boarding schools in India, where he began using the name Freddie. The adopted surname Mercury came later, after his family emigrated to the UK in 1964, and he began to pursue a music career in west London. \u201cI think changing his name was part of him assuming this different skin,\u201d Queen bandmate Brian May said in a 2000 documentary. \u201cI think it helped him to be this person that he wanted to be. The Bulsara person was still there, but for the public he was going to be this different character, this god.\"\n\nHe basically had to masquerade as a white man to succeed - Leo Kalyan\n\nThis character also helped him to dodge some of the racial prejudices of the era. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for brown people in the Western music industry, and Freddie kind of knew that,\u201d says Leo Kalyan, a queer British-Pakistani singer-songwriter who hails Mercury as \u201cthe greatest performer of all time\u201d. Kalyan says that Mercury was \u201csmart enough to know that he basically had to masquerade as a white man to succeed\u201d, and says his South Asian heritage is still not fully understood today \u201cbecause South Asians are still deliberately ignored within the Western music industry\u201d.\n\nMercury\u2019s sexuality isn\u2019t now ignored in the same way, but there\u2019s still no definitive way to describe him. \u201cI think if Freddie were living now the way he lived in his own lifetime, we\u2019d probably call him \u2018queer\u2019 rather than \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018bisexual\u2019,\u201d says Ryan Butcher, editor of LGBT website PinkNews. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about sexuality with him; it was about his whole identity and the flamboyant persona he projected on stage, which is one of the main things Queen are known for.\u201d\n\nBut because Mercury never came out as LGBT or aligned himself publicly with the LGBT-rights movement, it could be argued that his status as a queer icon is questionable. His bandmate Brian May said in 2008: \u201cI know that all through his life Fred didn\u2019t think that whether he was gay or not was important.\u201d However, Aston points out that Mercury became famous in the 1970s, a time when artists rare spoke openly about their sexuality. \u201cDavid Bowie did describe himself as bisexual [publicly],\u201d Aston says, \u201cbut he had the safety net of a wife and child.\u201d Aston also points out that we readily embrace Judy Garland as a queer icon \u201ceven though she didn\u2019t make statements about anything to do with homophobia and LGBT acceptance\u201d.\n\nHe was so outrageously camp, it was almost like a double bluff \u2013 Martin Aston\n\nBy 1986, when Mercury and Queen gave their most iconic performance at Live Aid, there were some openly gay performers in the mainstream; the UK\u2019s biggest-selling single that year was Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way by the Communards, whose frontman Jimmy Somerville was proudly gay and highly engaged with the LGBT-rights movement. Nevertheless, Wham! singer George Michael remained in the closet, and Culture Club\u2019s Boy George had navigated his first flush of fame a few years earlier by toning down his homosexuality. \u201cAlthough I famously said at the time that I\u2019d rather have a cup of tea than sex, my sex life was actually really rampant,\u201d Boy George told The Guardian in 2007. \u201cBut I\u2019d been brought up to think it was dirty and wrong, and not to be made public.\u201d\n\nMercury\u2019s approach to reconciling his private life with his public persona as the frontman of a rock band with a sizeable straight, male fanbase was playful and sophisticated. Because he never responded to rumours about his sexuality, it was easy for this fanbase to interpret his super-flamboyant and theatrical performing style as what Aston calls \u201ca camp laugh\u201d rather than something evincing queerness. Mercury\u2019s solo song Living on My Own, originally released in 1985, but which reached number one in the UK two years after his death after getting a club-friendly remix, is a catchy expression of loneliness that paints Mercury as a bachelor, but not necessarily a \u201cconfirmed bachelor\u201d in the now somewhat dated euphemistic sense. \u201cHe was so outrageously camp, it was almost like a double bluff,\u201d Aston adds. Ryan Butcher goes further, describing Mercury as \u201calmost a covert agent for the LGBT community, dropping these little seeds of queer culture into the heterosexual mindset\u201d.\n\nIn the \u201880s, Mercury was known for his tight white vests and moustache \u2013 his take on the Castro Clone look that originated in San Francisco\u2019s queer Castro district and became popular in the gay underground, but which was less familiar to mainstream music fans. It could be argued that Mercury was effectively hiding in plain sight. Certainly, he didn\u2019t let his massive fame stop him from visiting popular London gay venues like Heaven and the Royal Vauxhall Tavern. Actress Cleo Rocos wrote in her 2013 memoir that she, Mercury and comedian Kenny Everett even managed to sneak Princess Diana into the latter venue by disguising her in drag.\n\nThe clues he gave\n\nPerhaps one of the most daring ways in which Mercury expressed his natural campness was in Queen\u2019s 1984 video for the single I Want to Break Free, in which he and his Queen bandmates dressed as female characters from the British soap opera Coronation Street, a decision which damaged their career in the US. Brian May recalled in 2017: \u201cI remember being on the promo tour in the Midwest of America and people\u2019s faces turning ashen and they would say, \u2018No, we can\u2019t play this. We can\u2019t possibly play this. You know, it looks homosexual.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Queen\u2019s music, meanwhile, there were always clues about Mercury\u2019s private life for fans who wanted \u2013 and had the knowledge of the gay scene \u2013 to spot them. On Queen\u2019s 1978 hit Don\u2019t Stop Me Now, Mercury sings that he wants \u201cto make a supersonic woman of you\u201d and \u201ca supersonic man out of you\u201d. In the video, he wears a T-shirt from Mineshaft, a popular New York BDSM gay bar of the time. Even the band\u2019s name, Queen, can be seen as a winking allusion to its frontman\u2019s identity. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious what \u2018Queen\u2019 is getting at,\u201d says Kalyan, \u201cbut when I told my mum a few years ago, she couldn\u2019t believe it. She said she\u2019d always thought that \u2018Queen\u2019 just meant regal or majestic.\u201d\n\nIn a similar way, Kalyan says Mercury\u2019s music contains signifiers of his South Asian heritage, citing the use of the Arabic word \u2018Bismillah\u2019 in Bohemian Rhapsody. \u201cOnly a person with an awareness of Islamic culture would have known that word, which is the first word in the Koran [meaning In the Name of God], and put it into a song like Bohemian Rhapsody,\u201d he says. Kalyan adds that among the South Asian community, \u201cit\u2019s very common knowledge that Freddie was Indian and had been massively inspired by Bollywood singers like Lata Mangeshkar, who is known for having an incredible vocal range like Freddie\u201d.\n\nBut when it came to both his sexuality and his ethnicity, Mercury favoured privacy over direct proclamations until the end of his life. As Kalyan points out, \u201che didn\u2019t talk about going to school in India or his love for Lata Mangeshkar. That wasn\u2019t part of his narrative\u201d. Nor was his sexuality: on 22 November 1991, following what he called \u201cenormous conjecture\u201d in the press, Mercury finally released a statement confirming that he had been tested HIV positive, and had Aids, but made no mention of his relationship with Jim Hutton. Around 24 hours later, he died. \u201cThink about the immediacy of that \u2013 one of the biggest stars on the planet announces he has Aids, then dies of the disease,\u201d says Ryan Butcher, who calls it \u201ca culture shock that seems almost unfathomable today\u201d. Privately, Mercury had been diagnosed as HIV positive four years earlier, and Butcher suggests, speculatively, that his friendship with the late Diana, Princess of Wales while living with HIV and Aids could have been a contributing factor in her decision to promote better awareness of the disease. But this, like so much with Mercury, is something we\u2019ll probably never know for certain.\n\nNearly 28 years after his death, the real Freddie Mercury remains cherished. \u201cAt this stage, he\u2019s not just an icon, but a British national treasure,\u201d says Aston. Kalyan calls him \u201ca massive queer icon\u201d and \u201ca brown South Asian icon in western music\u201d. Whether Mercury would have liked these terms or not, it\u2019s hard not to respect what he achieved in his lifetime. In an era when homophobia and racism were far more prevalent than they are today, Freddie Mercury was the queer, South Asian frontman of the band who released one of rock's most iconic singles, Bohemian Rhapsody, and the best-selling album in UK chart history, Queen's Greatest Hits. However it\u2019s also arguable that the mystique he cultivated around his identity, whether he felt forced into that or not, has only burnished his status as one of pop\u2019s most captivating enigmas.\n\nNever Boring: The Freddie Mercury Solo Box Set is out now\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
