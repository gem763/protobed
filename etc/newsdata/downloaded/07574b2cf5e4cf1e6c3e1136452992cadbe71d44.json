That\u2019s why we\u2019re tackling Things We Don\u2019t Talk About, a series in which we track down the best hygiene-, sex-, and bodily function\u2013related things we all need but might be too embarrassed to ask about. In this installment, we consult experts on the best remedies for athlete\u2019s foot.\n\nSo called because it often affects those who wear sweaty, smelly shoes for long hours, athlete\u2019s foot is a fungal infection that develops on the skin between toes (and looks and feels itchy and even slimy). While it isn\u2019t difficult to treat, it definitely isn\u2019t pleasant. People who get athlete\u2019s foot also tend to frequent the warm, moist places where the contagious fungus abounds \u2014 like locker and shower rooms or pools \u2014 which is why Florida-based dermatologist Todd Minars suggests drying the toe webs thoroughly post-shower and not walking barefoot in those shared spaces. But if you have gotten it already and want to get rid of it fast, we talked to four dermatologists, four podiatrists, and a naturopathic physician for recommendations on how to treat athlete\u2019s foot at home, from antifungal creams and sprays, to powders, balms, and foot soaks.\n\nLamisil Athlete\u2019s Foot Antifungal Cream Across the board, Lamisil was recommended by almost all the experts we spoke to as the best topical product for treating athlete\u2019s foot. Available in cream and gel form, it\u2019s a powerful, broad-spectrum antifungal that Maral K. Skelsey \u2014 the director of the Dermatologic Surgery Center of Washington \u2014 says is helpful because it does double duty in killing fungus and stopping its growth. \u201cIt is well-absorbed into the outer layer of the skin, which is where athlete\u2019s foot lives. A cream formulation is good for someone with dry skin, whereas the gel or spray is preferable for anyone whose feet perspire a lot.\u201d Podiatrist Amnon Barnea, owner of Walk NYC Podiatry, adds, \u201c I usually advise patients to wash their feet with an antibacterial soap and then dry their feet well before applying the cream.\u201d $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nZeasorb Antifungal Treatment Powder, Athlete\u2019s Foot, 2.5oz Zeasorb antifungal powder was another popular recommendation, since experts tell me that its drier, powdery finish is ideal for treating athlete\u2019s foot, rather than something that will make your feet wetter and swampier. Skelsey suggests applying this between your toes and right inside your shoes for the best results. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nTinactin Athlete\u2019s Foot Super Absorbent Powder, Tolnaftate 1% Antifungal AF Treatment Three of our experts-podiatrist Dana Canuso, Shainhouse, and Dr. Rebecca Pruthi of Foot Care of Manhattan \u2014 all suggested the antifungal Tinactin powder, which Canuso says will dry out the fungus that often lives in sweaty shoes and can be used every day. Shainhouse also suggested it, and says it works on most foot fungus. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nVicks VapoRub Ointment, 1.76 Ounces It seems unconventional, but Skelsey even recommends Vicks VapoRub \u2014 yes, the cough suppressant \u2014 because she says it has a mild antifungal effect and can also allow antifungals to be better absorbed into the skin. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nGold Mountain Beauty Fungal Nail Eliminator $20 (was $30, now 33% off) And because athlete\u2019s foot is often linked to toenail fungus \u2014 podiatrist Paul I. Belitz explains that bacteria, fungus, and viral pathogens from one part of the foot can easily contaminate and reinfect another area if left untreated \u2014 it\u2019s helpful to use a two-pronged approach that will treat toe fungus, as well. He says that anyone who isn\u2019t willing to see a specialist should at least try something like Gold Mountain Beauty\u2019s Total Foot Care line \u2014 which sells a fungal nail eliminator \u2014 especially if you\u2019re diabetic and more prone to serious foot problems. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\n20% White Vinegar \u2014 200 Grain Vinegar Concentrate Minars says he doesn\u2019t typically recommend household items for dealing with a fungal skin problem like this that can involve bacteria, but he does find white vinegar helpful because it kills gram-negative bacteria. \u201cYou could do a 1:1 white-vinegar-to-water solution and use it to soak your feet and then dry them thoroughly.\u201d The drying thoroughly part is key: Canuso says that soaking your feet might help the fungus temporarily, but can risk keeping the area moist (and make things worse). Dermatologist Paul Dean of Grossmont Dermatology Medical Clinic says even an at-home baking-soda mixture will work because baking soda has been shown to have antifungal properties. He recommends soaking your feet in warm water in a large bucket or basin mixed with about a half-cup of baking soda, for about 15 minutes twice a day. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nDomeboro Soothing Soak Rash Relief Powder Packets, 12 $14 (was $15, now 7% off) Minars recommends the rinse solution Domeboro, which is used to calm skin irritations and rashes, so it will be useful for curbing the itch. $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nArtNaturals 100% Pure Tea Tree Essential Oil For a more natural option, Canuso and Katie Stage \u2014 a naturopathic physician at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Medical Center \u2014 both like tea-tree oil because it has some antifungal and antiseptic properties. Stage says she sees limited results with its use alone, which is why she suggests trying a few drops of the stuff after applying something to dry the feet first, such as arrowroot powder, and combining it with other essential oils (a mix of oregano, thyme, and lavender). Cunha is also a fan of tea tree oil and recommends doing a tea tree oil soak by putting a few drops of it in warm water. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
