However, it can seem like you have butterflies in your stomach when you are celebrating Diwali for the first time as a couple. So here are few guidelines for you to follow and create some beautiful moments this Diwali.Decorating your home this Diwali with your bae can be a great bonding exercise. Take out the diyas and colours and make a diya rangoli together. Or go shopping for some accessories to make your home colourful and festive.Everyone loves a well thought out gift. Gifting your Bae something that he mentioned in the passing can make his day. Or better still, book a couple\u2019s spa and enjoy some couple time where both of you are getting pampered.While there may be several Diwali traditions that you may have followed since you were a child, it is time for you to create your own couple\u2019s tradition this Diwali. It could be something as simple as arranging a small treasure hunt for your bae, or going to the temple together, or going to children's orphanage.Now while you may want to celebrate Diwali with just the two of you, you may also want to ask him if he wants to celebrate it with family. Or if you both want to celebrate it with both your family, then perhaps you need to decide whose place you should go for lunch and whose place you should go for dinner. Either way, it is both of you as a team deciding how to spend your first Diwali.Have a happy Diwali!", "description": "Celebrating Diwali as a new couple can be the best thing that can happen to your relationship.
