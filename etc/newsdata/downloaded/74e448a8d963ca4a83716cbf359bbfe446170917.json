The stock was 3.7% lower as of 10:43 a.m. in .\n\nHalkbank\u2019s slump underscores the increasing pressure on the Turkish economy and assets as the row with NATO ally the U.S. over Ankara\u2019s decision to send troops across its borders into Syria deepens. The indictment against Halkbank was filed Tuesday in a Manhattan federal court and overlaps with increasing calls from U.S. lawmakers from both parties for President Donald Trump to punish Turkey severely for its military offensive.\n\nWednesday\u2019s market reaction extended beyond the lender\u2019s stock. The yield on Halkbank\u2019s July 2021 dollar surged more than 450 basis points on Wednesday to 13.9%. That\u2019s about double the yield on the similar-dated debt of some of its peers, a sign that investors are beginning to price in financial distress.\n\nThe bank last sold bonds overseas in July 2016 and last raised a syndicated loan from international lenders in December 2015.\n\n(Updates with share prices, more on Turkey-U.S. tensions.)", "description": "Halkbank Shares Slump After U.S. Opens Sanctions-Busting Case", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb78fb7190b03df9e72aef660dc5fbe7a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
