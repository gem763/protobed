Bush administration official who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, would represent Taylor and another witness in the impeachment probe: Pompeo\u2019s former chief of staff, Michael McKinley.\n\nTrump attacked Taylor and Bellinger earlier this week on Twitter by labeling them \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d while adding that he didn\u2019t know Taylor. Trump also said this week that Republicans who do not support his agenda are \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\nTaylor testified behind closed doors to Congress on Tuesday that a White House meeting and military aid to Ukraine were contingent on Kiev opening investigations into 2016 election interference and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenDemocrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Sanders to release health records by end of year Ocasio-Cortez calls out GOP lawmakers asking to be arrested, citing privilege MORE and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement in a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, according to his opening statement.\n\nThe testimony from Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, undercut Trump's repeated claims that there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine. Trump has maintained that his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that House Democrats are pursuing a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him to damage his reelection prospects.\n\nTrump did not respond to questions Friday about whether he believed Taylor lied in his statement to Congress.\n\nA rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House showed Trump had asked Zelensky to pursue investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens. There is no evidence the Bidens engaged in criminal wrongdoing.\n\nThe phone call triggered an intelligence community whistleblower complaint alleging an effort by Trump to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. Trump has accused the whistleblower of offering a misleading account of the conversation and insisted his actions were about fighting \u201ccorruption\u201d and had nothing to do with the upcoming presidential election. Biden is the Democratic front-runner for the party's nomination.\n\nWhen asked on Friday why Pompeo hired him, Trump said, \u201cEverybody makes mistakes. Mike Pompeo? Everybody makes mistakes.\u201d\n\nTaylor, a career foreign service officer, came out of retirement earlier this year when Pompeo asked him to head the U.S. embassy in Kiev. Taylor was last appointed by George W. Bush to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009. It\u2019s unclear what his politics are, and Trump did not provide evidence Friday to back up his assertions about Taylor's political leanings.\n\nThe president and his GOP allies have attacked Democrats over what they view as an unfair impeachment process, criticizing the fact that hearings have been conducted behind closed doors and that Democrats have not held a floor vote to formalize the inquiry.\n\n\"This is a hoax\" Trump said Friday. \"This is a disgrace that this could happen in our country.\"\n\nWhile the Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the investigation, Democrats have succeeded in receiving testimony from current and former officials \u2013 career civil servants and political appointees \u2013 by issuing subpoenas.\n\nThose victories have prompted GOP allies to put pressure on the White House to beef up its defense team and establish a more coordinated strategy to deal with the impeachment probe.\n\nBut Trump on Friday rejected the idea of bolstering his staff to counter the fast-moving inquiry.\n\n\"Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t have teams. Everyone\u2019s talking about teams. I\u2019m the team. I did nothing wrong,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nUpdated at 2:02 p.m.", "description": "President Trump on Friday called William Taylor, the top diplomat who recently testified in the House impeachment inquiry, a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d and said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a mistake hiring him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
