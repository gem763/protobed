He is shown in a still from a video released in April, having not been seen since he spoke at the Grand Mosque in Mosul in 2014\n\nEx-Saddam Hussein ally 'is new ISIS leader' ISIS's new leader is believed to be a former officer in Saddam Hussein's military who forged an alliance with al-Baghdadi in prison in Iraq before becoming his enforcer and chief policymaker. Abdullah Qardash - nicknamed The Professor for his reputation as a legislator - is known as a cruel but popular figure among ISIS rank-and-file. According to a statement by Amaq, ISIS's press agency, Baghdadi appointed Qardash to run the group's day-to-day operations in August this year, making him the heir-apparent after his former boss killed himself during a raid by US forces in Syria. Abdullah Qardash is believed to be the new leader of ISIS after Baghdadi's death He is understood to have already taken over a number of duties from al-Baghdadi prior to his demise this week when he detonated a suicide vest. An official told Newsweek: 'Baghdadi was a figurehead. He was not involved in operations or day-to-day.' 'All Baghdadi did was say yes or no\u2014no planning.' It comes as experts have warned the IS and the extremist jihadist movements have over the last one-and-a-half decades repeatedly shown resilience after the death of key leaders. And their militants, battle-hardened by years of fighting, remain in place around the world. The group may have been ready for the death of Baghdadi and after an initial adjustment period of a few months could even use it as a rallying case for launching new attacks, they added.\n\nBaghdadi had been detained in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nHe was held at Camp Bucca, a notorious militant breeding ground which housed tens of thousands of Iraqi insurgents.\n\nWhile there, his DNA and fingerprints were taken and it was that evidence which allowed Trump to confirm Baghdadi's death yesterday morning.\n\nLab technicians conducted an onsite DNA test to make sure and within 15 minutes of his death they had positively identified the target.\n\nBaghdadi's remains were taken from the compound and will be buried at sea in the same way as Osama bin Laden's body in 2011.\n\nOnce the U.S. troops had finished, they obliterated Baghdadi's compound in order to prevent it becoming a shrine, an official told Newsweek.\n\nU.S. intelligence workers will now begin sifting through the documents seized from the compound amid warnings that the threat from ISIS has not yet gone.\n\nWhile Baghdadi's death may leave ISIS divided and rudderless, there are fears that his followers will now carry out revenge attacks against the West.\n\nFrance's interior minister yesterday called for increased vigilance in a country which has already been the victim of multiple ISIS attacks.\n\n'The possible intensification of jihadist propaganda following this death, which could possibly call for acts of vengeance, requires the most extreme vigilance,' said Christophe Castaner.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also urged caution after the death of the 48-year-old terrorist leader.\n\n'Al-Baghdadi's death is a hard blow against Islamic State, but it is just a stage,' Macron said.\n\nFormer U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2020, warned that ISIS 'remains a threat to the American people and our allies'.\n\nRita Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group which follows jihadist media, said the extremist movement had overcome the loss of individual leaders before.\n\n'ISIS has illustrated its operational resiliency, and will definitely capitalise on Baghdadi's death for recruitment and calls for attacks,' she wrote on Twitter.\n\nTrump did not reveal the precise nature of what was discovered, saying it was 'highly sensitive' material which was exactly what Washington wanted.\n\nEarlier this year documents recovered from an ISIS battleground revealed plans to set up sleeper cells and carry out attacks and kidnappings in Europe.\n\nAccording to letters written by the jihadists ISIS is aiming to recruit 'as many suicide bomber brothers as possible' and gather an arsenal of weapons.\n\nThe Osama bin Laden raid in 2011 uncovered a trove of documents which helped to reveal the inner workings of al-Qaeda.\n\nAmong the collection was a 228-page, handwritten personal journal of bin Laden and tens of thousands of images and audio files.\n\nThere were also bizarre elements including a pornography stash.\n\nFor the footsoldiers still loyal to the Islamic State terror group were caught by surprise by the crack American team descending upon their high-profile prize \u2013 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted man\n\nTwisted metal: Burned and deformed materials lie in the rubble at the site in north-western Syria where Baghdadi was killed in a raid by U.S. special forces\n\nScavenging: People sift through the rubble near the village of Barisha yesterday after the compound was destroyed by the American raid\n\nBaghdadi was largely regarded as a figurehead of the global terror network, and was described as 'irrelevant for a long time' by a coalition spokesman in 2017.\n\nHis whereabouts had long been a mystery and he was not among the last ISIS holdouts in Baghouz when the group lost its last patch of territory in March.\n\nNicknamed 'The Ghost', he had not appeared in public since he delivered a sermon at Mosul's famed Al-Nuri mosque in 2014 declaring himself 'caliph'.\n\nHe resurfaced in a video in April this year in which he discussed the Easter Sunday bombings which killed more than 250 people in Sri Lanka.\n\nMore recently he had called for his followers to break ISIS prisoners out of the camps where they are being held in Syria.\n\nThe U.S. State Department had posted a $25million reward for information on his whereabouts.\n\nThe village of Barisha, near the compound where Baghdadi was killed, is near the border with Turkey but far from the regions where U.S. forces were deployed and used to operating.\n\nThe area is mountainous and sparsely populated, about 15 north of Idlib city, the capital of the province.\n\nIt is nominally under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an outfit that includes ex-members of Al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate.\n\nLandscape: An aerial view of the site taken yesterday shows the damage the helicopter caused on the site where al-Baghdadi was thought to have lived\n\nReduced to rubble: The site of the compound is seen yesterday after the helicopter raid ordered by Donald Trump\n\nBut ISIS sleeper cells and the al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Deen group are also present in the area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor says.\n\nIn addition, Al-Qaeda also remains a potent threat in some parts of the Middle East and Africa.\n\nA UN panel warned earlier this year that al-Qaeda 'remains resilient' and said its affiliate groups were stronger than ISIS in Yemen, Somalia and much of West Africa.\n\nMeanwhile in Libya, ISIS and al-Qaeda apparently have overlapping areas of influence, with up to 200 fighters backing al-Qaeda.\n\nIn addition, al-Qaeda could be poised to recoup some support from ISIS after its 'caliphate' crumbled to nothing earlier this year.\n\nUp to 30,000 of those who travelled to the caliphate' may still be alive and some of them may join al-Qaeda and related groups, the panel warned.\n\nTrump said the raid - involving eight helicopters flying more than an hour from an undisclosed base - was carried out with cooperation from Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iraq.\n\nHe also thanked the Syrian Kurds 'for a certain support they were able to give us.'\n\nSpecial forces 'executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style,' he said.\n\nMeeting in the situation room Saturday night (from left to right): National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley and Brig. General Marcus Evans\n\nAl-Baghdadi fled into a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that snaked through the compound, the President said.\n\nThe terrorist leader wore a suicide vest and dragged along three children as he fled from the American troops.\n\nTrump said that as U.S. troops and their dogs closed in, the militant went 'whimpering and crying and screaming all the way' to his death.\n\n'He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,' Trump said. 'He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.'\n\nAt its height, ISIS controlled swaths of Iraq and Syria in a self-declared caliphate, brutally imposing a puritanical version of Islam.\n\nThe group planned or inspired terrorism attacks across Europe, while using social media to lure foreign volunteers.\n\nIt took years of war, during which IS became notorious for mass executions and sickening hostage beheadings, before its final slice of territory in Syria was seized this March.\n\nOperation Obliteration: How US gunships cornered ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before he 'dragged three children with him into a dead-end tunnel and detonated a suicide belt'\n\nBy Larisa Brown and John R Bradley for the Daily Mail\n\nIt was shortly after midnight in the remote village of Barisha that residents heard a familiar noise coming from above.\n\nThe whir of rotor blades in the darkness signalled something was coming, something military \u2013 which, in these parts, usually brings death.\n\nSure enough, within minutes the sound of bullets piercing the air followed.\n\nBut this was no usual firefight, with those brandishing automatic weapons on the ground severely outgunned by an enemy they had not been expecting.\n\nFor the footsoldiers still loyal to the Islamic State terror group were caught by surprise by the crack American team descending upon their high-profile prize \u2013 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted man.\n\nFive years after he had launched his self-styled 'caliphate', and brought a new wave of terror to the globe, the net was finally closing on the IS leader.\n\nCapture or kill\n\nBeing played on a live feed to those back in the White House, 'as though watching a movie', according to President Donald Trump, the helicopter gunships circled, taking small arms fire but delivering their far more devastating riposte.\n\nSome hovered in the air, laying down a cover of fire underneath which a crack team of elite Delta Force commandos and Rangers could slip to the floor safely, landing outside Baghdadi's compound on the edge of the village.\n\nArmed with highly-trained dogs and a robot to withstand suicide attacks, the 70-strong team was ready for a bloodbath.\n\nCapture or kill ... either option had been authorised.\n\nAfter playing a round of golf earlier, Mr Trump had returned to the White House, settling in the Situation Room alongside his top generals and security officials.\n\nThis was the moment they had been planning for since a lucky break in Iraq last month.\n\nIraqi-Kurdish officials had detained one of Baghdadi's many wives, a nephew and the wife of one of his trusted couriers.\n\n'Good riddance' say families of British ISIS victims Families of Britons killed during ISIS's blood-thirsty campaign of terror under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's leadership saluted the madman's death last night. Charlotte Coleman, whose daughter Olivia died in the Manchester Arena attack, told The Sun: 'If they've killed him, good on them. No one will ever forget what they've done.' And Mike Haines, whose brother aid-worker David was beheaded in Syria, added: 'His evil and cowardly beliefs and actions lack any humanity and caused the death of many innocent people.'\n\nThe information from that trio led them, it is understood, to an IS hideout in the desert of western Iraq, a bolthole that was to prove extremely valuable.\n\nFor found inside, among some of the IS leader's personal possessions, were the coordinates of his secret location, a non-descript house in a part of northwest Syria that was controlled by Al Qaeda, an enemy of Baghdadi.\n\nEven for the organisation that murdered more than 3,000 in 9/11, the brutal violence of Islamic State was too much and Baghdadi was seen as unhinged.\n\nWith the CIA now on board, the mission to take out Baghdadi had suddenly grown even more dangerous.\n\nTrump looks on\n\nWhen Mr Trump arrived on Saturday to watch the operation in real-time, it came four days after he had given the green light, with several other opportunities aborted at the last minute.\n\nMoments after he was in place, at around 9pm UK time, the US helicopters lifted off from their air base in Iraq and flew some 500 miles over 'very very dangerous territory', a journey that lasted just over an hour.\n\nThe teams had to cross Russian, Syrian and Turkish airspace to reach their objective. With current tensions in the region, they could easily have been mistaken for an invading force.\n\nUS commanders notified Moscow, Damascus and Ankara that something 'big' that they 'would like' was going to happen \u2013 but they did not share their ultimate goal.\n\nAs the helicopters, a mix of Chinooks and Black Hawks, approached the compound in the war-ravaged Idlib province, near the Turkish border, all hell broke loose.\n\nDonald Trump confirming that the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He said he had watched and monitored the whole operation Saturday night\n\nTroops storm in\n\nFearing a booby-trapped front door, the elite soldiers made their own opening, blowing holes into the wall of Baghdadi's den. Two 'wives', both wearing suicide vests which thankfully did not detonate, were killed in the ensuing firefight, along with a large number of Baghdadi's 'fighters and companions'.\n\nAs they cleared the building carefully, tracking room by room in the darkness, an Arabic speaker called out, urging Baghdadi to give himself up.\n\nBut the terrorist who called for death to the West ran, drawing Delta Force deeper into the compound they had studied from plans \u2013 memorising every corner, every hiding place and every possible escape route.\n\nAs the team went further, they helped 11 children get out alive, while a group of Islamic State extremists, realising their time was up, surrendered. Mr Trump said there 'more dead than alive' in the aftermath.\n\nOnce the compound had been emptied of others, the US troops and their dogs chased Baghdadi into an underground tunnel, taking three children with him.\n\nThe soldiers knew it was a dead end and there was no escape, so proceeded slowly, sending in their highly-trained canines.\n\nTarget down\n\nIt was at that point that Baghdadi's murderous reign came to an end as he detonated his own suicide vest, killing himself, his terrified young hostages and bringing much of the tunnel down upon them.\n\nAnnouncing the news yesterday, Mr Trump said: 'The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.'\n\nBack in the White House, having been informed of the explosion, they held their breath. Back in the tunnel, the US team dug through the rubble.\n\nWreckage: The rubble and destruction caused by the military raid in the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha, close to the border with Turkey\n\nNot much of Baghdadi was left \u2013 but enough for a DNA test using a small field kit.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, news crackled through to the Situation Room on the radio: '100 per cent confidence Jackpot. Over.'\n\nJackpot is thought to be the codename the US gave to Baghdadi, the same name they had given to Osama Bin Laden during a similar operation in 2011.\n\nThe overall Bin Laden operation was given the classified name 'Operation Neptune Spear', a reference to the trident in the insignia of SEAL Team Six who went after the terrorist.\n\nThis time, the mission for Baghdadi was given a more human touch, named after US human rights worker Kayla Mueller, who was captured by IS and, according to the US, made a personal prisoner of its leader before she was killed.\n\nWith Baghdadi confirmed dead, and the opposition outside 'obliterated' in the president's words, Delta Force made their way out but not before 'exploiting' the scene, a military term for intelligence gathering on the go.\n\nHideout blitzed\n\nThey grabbed every computer, every phone, every bit of paper they could find in the hope it will bring them closer to tracking those still loyal to IS and putting an end to them once and for all. Two hours after they touched down, the team was back in the air, being whisked to safety, heading out of Syria along the same path they had taken to get in.\n\nThe last action was to call in an airstrike by US drones, reducing Baghdadi's hideout to rubble, wiping it from the face of the Earth and covering their tracks.\n\nWhen he had word his units were back safe and sound, not a casualty among them, Donald Trump fired up his Twitter to tease the world with a cryptic message: 'Something very big has just happened!'\n\nHe then stayed silent until breaking the news yesterday morning, telling reporters: 'Last night, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice.'", "description": "President Donald Trump revealed  that U.S. troops had recovered 'highly sensitive material' during the night-time raid in Syria which ended when the jihadist leader blew himself up with a suicide vest.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20271992-0-image-a-33_1572254667277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
