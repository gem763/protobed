(Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Houston Astros manager A.J. Hinch threatened to pull his team off the field during the remain two games in New York should the fans at Yankee Stadium throw debris onto the field.\n\nFans threw water bottles and baseballs onto the field during Game 3 of the American League Championship Series, according to outfielder Josh Reddick, and Hinch added there were also objects thrown into the bullpen.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI will pull the team off the field if we get in that situation again where bottles are being thrown and balls are being thrown and it becomes unruly. There's other ways to support your home team, and this place does as good a job as anybody to trying to police that while also trying to create an environment that's all pro-Yankees,\u201d Hinch said before his team attempted to move within one win of reaching the World Series. \u201cIt would be a very ugly scene for baseball, a very ugly scene for the Yankees, if one of our guys was hit by something from the upper deck. Something tragic could happen and nobody wants that.\n\nYankee Stadium is one of the toughest postseason venues for opponents. Reddick labeled it as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d after the game, and Hinch said he informed the umpiring crew that he felt a \u201cdangerous situation\u201d was brewing during the game.\n\n\u201cThere's no place for that. Both teams will agree,\u201d Hinch said of objects being thrown on the field. \u201cAnd it's really hard to stop fans from doing that. But it's also very dangerous. MLB is aware. We're aware.\u201d\n\nThe visitor\u2019s bullpen at Yankee Stadium is located in left-center, and fans are situated right above the area, allowing them to let those relieves know exactly how they feel. Right field at Yankee Stadium is also a notoriously tough position for visitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nReddick was already critical of the atmosphere that develops in the right-field stands prior to the series shifting to New York, telling the Houston Chronicle that security does little to intervene.\n\nThe outfielder homered in Tuesday\u2019s win to give the Astros a 2-0 lead in the second.\n\n\u201cI think I saw probably seven or eight water bottles out in the outfield, two baseballs got thrown from center to left,\u201d Reddick said Tuesday, according to the New York Post. \u201cSo it\u2019s scary. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize how dangerous that can really be. You throw a baseball hard enough and it hits somebody in the head and we\u2019re not looking, it could do some damage to you as a player. ... So it\u2019s definitely disrespectful, but at the same time, very unsafe.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Astros manager A.J.
