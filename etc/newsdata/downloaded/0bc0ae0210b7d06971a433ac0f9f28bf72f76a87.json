A barrel of Brent traded up $6 to $66.28 US.\n\nU.S. benchmark West Texas crude was up around 9 per cent. U.S. gasoline and heating oil similarly were up over 8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively before markets opened in New York.\n\nSaturday's attack halted production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day, more than half of Saudi Arabia's global daily exports and more than 5 per cent of the world's daily crude oil production. Most of that output goes to Asia.\n\nThe facility is some 330 kilometres northeast of the Saudi capital of Riyadh. (CBC)\n\nAt 5.7 million barrels of crude oil a day, the Saudi disruption would be the greatest on record for world markets, according to figures from the Paris-based International Energy Agency. It just edges out the 5.6 million-barrels-a-day disruption around the time of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, according to the IEA.\n\nSaudi Arabia has pledged that its stockpiles would keep global markets supplied as it rushes to repair damage at the Abqaiq facility and its Khurais oil field.\n\nAramco's full return to normal oil production volumes \"may take months,\" two sources briefed on the company's operations said on Monday.\n\n\"It is still bad,\" one of the sources said.\n\nOn Sunday, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters that Saudi Arabia's oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, but that Aramco may have to cut exports later if the outage in output continues for long.\n\nTrump said the U.S. had reason to believe it knows who was behind the attack \u2014 his secretary of state had blamed Iran the previous day. He assured his Twitter followers that \"we are ... locked and loaded\" depending on verification and were waiting to hear from the Saudis as to who they believe was behind the attack and \"under what terms we would proceed!\"\n\nThe tweets followed a National Security Council meeting at the White House that included Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper.\n\nA U.S. official said all options, including a military response, were on the table, but said no decisions had been made Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nTrump's \"locked and loaded\" comment mirrors similar remarks he made following Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone in June. However, the president said he pulled back from retaliating against Iran at the last minute.\n\n'Blind and futile' comments\n\nU.S. officials also offered highly detailed satellite photos of the Saudi sites that show damage suggesting the attack came from the north, where Iran or Iraq are, rather than from Yemen to the south. Iraq's prime minister has denied the attack came from his country, where Iranian-backed Shia rebels operate.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed the U.S. allegations as \"blind and futile comments.\"\n\nSaturday satellite image from Planet Labs Inc. shows thick black smoke rising from Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq, Saudi Arabia. (Planet Labs Inc via AP)\n\n\"The Americans adopted the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning toward 'maximum lies,\"' Mousavi said.\n\nThe U.S. satellite photos appear to show the attack on Abqaiq may have struck the most-sensitive part of the facility, its stabilization area. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies has said the area includes \"storage tanks and processing and compressor trains \u2014 which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations.\"\n\nStabilization means processing so-called sour crude oil into sweet crude. That allows it to be transported it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, or to refineries for local production.\n\nThe attack \"damaged five to seven spheroids and five out of ten stabilization towers,\" said Fernando Ferreira, the director of geopolitical risk at the Washington-based Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nFive \"or so stabilization towers appear to be destroyed and will have to be rebuilt \u2014 this will take many months,\" Ferreira said. \"The sophisticated attack now seems likely to reduce Abqaiq's 7 (million barrels of crude oil a day) capacity for an indefinite period\" measured in months.\n\nSaudi Aramco did not respond to questions from The Associated Press regarding damage at Abqaiq and the satellite images.", "description": "Global energy prices spiked on Monday after a weekend attack on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia caused the worst disruption to world supplies on record, and President Donald Trump warned the U.S. was \"locked and loaded\" to respond to the attack.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284851.1568628002!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/saudi-aramco-fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
