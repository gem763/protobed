There are currently 360 franchises across the country.\n\nAdministrator Robson Cotter Insolvency Group has taken over and says there was not enough money to keep the stores up-and-running, forcing more than 100 employees out of a job. The advisory firm is arranging the possibility other businesses could take over the closed Red Rooster stores (stock image)\n\n'Franchisees will elect not to renew their contract,' he told The Courier-Mail.\n\n'It's just another example of how tough it is out there in the food service franchise market.'\n\nMr Mortimer cited Red Rooster's offer as an obstacle. While McDonald's and Hungry Jacks can expand into desserts, salads or chicken, Red Rooster remains focused on poultry.\n\n'We've seen those poultry prices increase and that's putting a strain on franchisees,' he said.\n\nMr Mortimer suggested rising leasing costs, wages and rent could affect a franchisees ability to stay open.\n\nDaily Mail Australia visited a number of Sydney Red Rooster stores in May 2018, amid rumours of franchisee bankruptcy.

'I don't eat McDonald's. I don't eat Hungry Jack's. I don't eat Kentucky Fried Chicken. That's all c**p.'\n\nRed Rooster was founded by Peter Kailis family at Kelmscott in Western Australia in 1972, four years after KFC opened its first local restaurant at Guildford in Sydney.\n\nFrom the start, Red Rooster's specialty had been roast chicken but recent menu additions have seen the appearance of lamb and fish and chips.\n\nRed Rooster on busy Liverpool Rd, Summer Hill, was quiet at lunchtime when visited by Daily Mail Australia\n\nAll stores Daily Mail Australia visited were clean - except for one filthy men's toilet - and operated by a small staff.\n\nAt Sydney Airport's domestic terminal, Red Rooster was competing with Mad Mex and Hungry Jack's outlets, as well as the nearby Sumo Salad, Wok On Air and NRG Express.\n\nOne passing flight attendant convinced two colleagues to choose the chicken shop for an 11am snack. 'Do you want to get some Red Rooster before it goes?' he said.\n\nA couple of hours later at Summer Hill, on busy Liverpool Road in Sydney's inner-west, the young woman behind Red Rooster's counter was not run off her feet.\n\nBetween 1pm and 2pm about 10 customers passed through the doors but the drive-though was doing steady business and the store also offered in-house deliveries as well as Menulog and Uber Eats.\n\nThe Red Rooster at Lakemba, on Canterbury Road in Sydney's south-west, was a little busier shortly before 3pm. Half a dozen customers took up some of the 10 chairs, two long tables and two booths.", "description": "More than 100 fast food workers in Queensland were left stunned when they were told they were out of a job when seven stores were put into voluntary administration on Monday.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie", "Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19764720-0-image-a-18_1571183204680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
