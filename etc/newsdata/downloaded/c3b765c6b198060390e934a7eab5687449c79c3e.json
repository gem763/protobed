[Photo by Yang Xiaoyu/chinadaily.com.cn]\n\nFor gallery goers, a Sept 25 visit to the Cervantes Institute in Beijing was a chance to pique their curiosity and enjoy the bizarre.\n\nEach visitor was instructed to wear a breathing mask at the reception desk before entering the exhibition hall. They were surprised to find that the usually quiet exhibition space had been turned into a busy and noisy fashion designer\u2019s studio.\n\nA number of young Chinese \u2018designers\u2019 (models, actually) were focused on their work. Among them, a tall, lean and muscular man attracted a gaggle of visitors to stop, watch and photograph his performance.\n\nThe young man first stuck a pair of light grey sweatpants on the wall. He then picked up an aerosol can and began spraying colored paint on the pants.\n\nBefore long, his efforts turned the pants rainbow-striped.
