This is despite there having been three earlier Category 5 storms during his presidency: Irma, Maria and Michael.\n\nJoshua Roberts/Reuters President Donald Trump speaks during a Federal Emergency Management Agency briefing on Hurricane Dorian on Sunday. Trump said he didn't think he had ever heard of Category 5 hurricanes, though there have been three, prior to Dorian, during his presidency.\n\n\u201cI knew it existed, and I\u2019ve seen some Category 4s \u2015 you don\u2019t even see them that much \u2015 but a Category 5 is something that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever even heard the term other than I know it\u2019s there,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThat same day he tweeted a warning that Alabama is among the states most likely to be \u201chit harder than anticipated\u201d by the approaching storm.\n\nThe National Weather Service later indirectly corrected Trump in its own tweet, insisting that Alabama \u201cwill NOT see any impacts from Dorian.\u201d Despite this, Trump on Monday lashed out at an ABC reporter who fact-checked his inclusion of Alabama, calling the network\u2019s report \u201cphony\u201d and insisting he was not wrong.\n\nNOAA/Reuters Hurricane Dorian was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on Tuesday after slowly crossing through the Bahamas.\n\nAlso, in a video announcement on Friday outside the White House, Trump warned viewers that the approaching storm could be an \u201cabsolute monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does seem almost certain that it\u2019s hitting dead center and that\u2019s not good,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get lucky ... all indications are it\u2019s going to hit very hard and it\u2019s going to be very big. Somebody said bigger or at least as big as Andrew,\u201d he said, referencing the 1992 Category 5 storm that was the most destructive to ever hit Florida.\n\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, speculating on the reason behind Trump\u2019s amplification of storm developments, suggested that in his mind, bigger is always better.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something that he likes the sound of a big number, so it\u2019s, \u2018Wow, Category 5,\u2019\u201d she said on CNN Monday. \u201cI think he just likes the sound of it and he thinks that a big number sounds good. He has always been somebody who traffics in big numbers.\u201d\n\nMaria Alejandra Cardona/Reuters Bea Tyson, 2, hangs out with her dog, Navy, at the beach in St. Augustine, Florida, on Tuesday.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s penchant for updates and commentary, Haberman speculated that the president likes being the first with information, even if it\u2019s half-baked.\n\n\u201cBecause it sounds better to say, \u2018Wow, can you believe this? This is shocking new information I\u2019m presenting to you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nOne such tool he uses to do this is, of course, Twitter, where over approximately 60 hours \u2015 between 7:45 a.m. on Saturday morning and 8 p.m. Monday night \u2015 he issued 122 tweets to the public, The New York Times reported.\n\nAs serious of a storm as Trump warned Dorian could be to the U.S., the president was ridiculed on social media for hitting a golf course on Saturday and Monday. This was after he gave the impression on Friday that he would spend the weekend monitoring the storm with experts at Camp David in Maryland.\n\nTrump on Tuesday defended his decision to hit the green following criticism by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, arguing that it was \u201ca very fast round.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s love of big crowd sizes, poll numbers and TV ratings extends to big storms, as well.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ec273240000320072feb2.jpeg?cache=nykbph8rka&ops=1778_1000"}
