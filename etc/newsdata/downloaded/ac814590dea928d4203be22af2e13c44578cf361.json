These drugs are having very serious medical outcomes for young people,\" Ackerman added.\n\nGirls were much more likely than boys to attempt suicide by what is known as \"self-poisoning\", and suicide attempts by self-poisoning in children and teens were higher in rural communities. These types of suicide attempts occurred more often during the school year, the study found.\n\nWhen people survive a self-poisoning suicide attempt, they may have heart problems or seizures afterwards. Ackerman said that the drugs may have an impact on brain function as well.\n\n\"This paper is a call to action for parents to increase their safe storage practices and talk to kids about their mental health concerns,\" he added. \"Ask your kids how they're doing.\"\n\nParents may think it's impossible to keep kids away from all medicines. \"But, if you're adding barriers \u2013 like a lock box or safe, and counting medication \u2013 those seemingly simple tasks can help. They can be a bridge to a child or teen seeing other options,\" Ackerman explained.\n\nRural communities more at risk\n\nFrom 2000 to 2018, more than 1.6 million young people between the ages of 10 and 25 attempted suicide by self-poisoning. The rates of these suicide attempts in young people aged 10 to 18 started to increase in 2011, the study found.\n\nAlmost one-quarter of those attempts resulted in a serious medical outcome. The drugs most used in these attempts were OTC pain relievers, antidepressants, antihistamines and antipsychotics. Opioids were only involved in 7% of cases with a serious medical outcome.\n\nADHD medications were more commonly used in the younger group \u2013 10- to 15-year-olds.\n\nLess densely-populated states were more likely to have reported cases ending in serious medical outcomes.\n\n\"Rural communities are more at risk. It might be social isolation, lack of access to mental health care and economic factors,\" Ackerman suggested.\n\nIn kids 18 and younger, suicide attempts by self-poisoning occurred more during the school months of September through May. This pattern wasn't seen in the 19- to 21-year-old age group. The 22- to 25-year-old group had an increase in the summer months.\n\nStruggling with sleep\n\n\"Younger people seem to be more vulnerable during the school year,\" Ackerman said. Although the study didn't look at causes behind the findings, he said that school stress, peer behaviours, bullying and social media likely play a role.\n\nDaniel Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, reviewed the study and said, \"In an acute suicidal crisis, people turn to the quickest, most easily available means.\"\n\nHe said there are usually signs before someone reaches a crisis level. \"People might be struggling with sleep; their appetite might be off; they might talk about aches and have other complaints about physical problems. They don't want to go to school. They don't want to interact with their friends,\" Reidenberg said.\n\nOf even greater concern is when someone talks about being a burden or says they have no hope for the future. They might start to look for ways to die or talk about suicide.\n\nConnections are crucial\n\nReidenberg said a huge red flag is if someone just can't sleep for a few days. \"Anxiety and agitation become worse as someone gets sicker. It's very, very important that anyone who might be at risk of suicide be monitored for sleep. It can be hard to notice disrupted sleep patterns in teens, but if there's one, two or three days without sleep, you need to have a conversation, and hopefully get some professional help.\"\n\nReidenberg added that connections are crucial: \"The more connections that people have, the better off they are. A sense of aloneness increases the sense of distress and the risk of suicide.\"\n\nIf you find your child has attempted self-poisoning, Ackerman said it's important to get them to the ER immediately. The sooner they get help, the better the chances for a good outcome.\n\nThe findings were published in Clinical Toxicology.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "According to new research, suicide attempts by teens using medications readily available in the home are increasing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6736/b7eb71febd834ba98a2c4b9e8cdcab8b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
