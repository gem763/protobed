(Alex Wroblewski/Reuters)\n\nWarren and her media allies will, however, keep doing their utmost to convince us otherwise.\n\n\u2018I have listened and I have learned,\u201d said Elizabeth Warren at a forum of Native American voters in Iowa last month. \u201cLike anyone who\u2019s being honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes. I am sorry for the harm I have caused.\u201d Did any reporter ask her what harm, specifically, she\u2019d caused, or what, specifically, she\u2019d learned? Did any reporter ask her if her \u201cmistakes\u201d were ones anyone could have made, or ones she believed any of her peers, either at Harvard or in the Senate, had also made?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, they did not.\n\nI suppose people think that the controversy over Warren\u2019s past claims of Native American ancestry has been put to bed, with Warren rising in the polls because she has plans for everything, including for Native Americans. But in fact, the controversy has not been put to bed, and it shouldn\u2019t be. It points to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s ambitions and lack of integrity, and forces us to ponder whether the rules really apply to those who would make them.\n\nThe media have certainly done their best to help Warren in putting the controversy to bed, though. The Boston Globe \u2014 in a story that briefly acknowledged that Warren\u2019s \u201cpolitical enemies have long pushed a narrative that her unsubstantiated claims of Native American heritage turbocharged her legal career\u201d \u2014 gave ample space to her own much-more-charitable version of events. Her reporter-defenders have pointed out that until a certain time in her life, she declined to participate in affirmative-action programs, though even they have had to admit that the crucial leaps in her academic career \u2014 her landing a job at the University of Pennsylvania and then moving on to Harvard \u2014 occurred after she began listing herself as a racial minority. The year before Harvard Law School hired her \u2014 and trumpeted her as the first woman of color so hired \u2014 it had been subject to major, headline-grabbing protests for giving tenure to four white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Warren could have been deluding herself as well. She claims that her belief in her Cherokee heritage came from longstanding family lore. But the fact that she participated in the now-cringe-inducing Pow Wow Chow cookbook and plagiarized her recipes from a French cookbook suggests a certain awareness that she was perpetrating a racial fraud. And then there is the fact that Cherokee Indian is not so much a \u201csocially constructed\u201d racial category as a specific, legally defined identity: You are a Cherokee when the Cherokee nation recognizes you as a member on its rolls. Surely someone who identified as a Native American academically and socially in the way Warren once claimed she did would have sought such official status. But she didn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren has repeatedly claimed over the years that her parents\u2019 marriage was rejected by racist grandparents because of her mother\u2019s Cherokee ancestry. But Cherokee genealogist Twila Barnes has said there\u2019s simply no evidence of Cherokee genealogy in Warren\u2019s family. Warren\u2019s mother was not some racial outcast, but the popular daughter of a prominent local family. And there\u2019s no evidence of the romantic elopement, or racist animus on the part of her paternal grandfather, Grant Herring, who regularly played golf with Carnal Wheeling, a recognized Cherokee.\n\nThe media haven\u2019t really known how to handle this story. Like a Geiger counter in a North Korean nuclear-weapons lab, the reaction of the \u201csmart set\u201d on Twitter was wildly disconcerting when Elizabeth Warren announced the results of her spectacularly ill-conceived DNA test earlier this year. At first, the trace amounts of Native American heritage were held up as proof against Donald Trump\u2019s attacks. Then, as geneticists and common sense intervened in the discussion, it became obvious that Warren\u2019s Native American roots were negligible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the social-climbing Warren begins to gain over actual socialist Bernie Sanders, I expect the Sandernistas to unload on the contradictions between the upwardly mobile Left\u2019s hatred of cultural appropriation and the changing racial identity and falsified family history of its darling Warren. If she survives that and wins the nomination, she\u2019ll face a general election in which the same basic problem remains.\n\nI predict that should she make it that far, everyone will just try to change the subject.", "description": "The controversy over Elizabeth Warren's past claims of Native American ancestry is not going away, much as Warren and her media allies would like to convince you otherwise.", "authors": ["Michael Brendan Dougherty", "Kyle Smith", "Andrew C.
