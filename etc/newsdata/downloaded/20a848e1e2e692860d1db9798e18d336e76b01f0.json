Was proroguing parliament designed to prevent MPs\u2019 scrutiny of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans or to give his government time to set out its new legislative agenda for when parliament returns on 14 October? So far Scottish and English courts have handed down contradictory judgments. The supreme court, sitting in London, must reconcile them over the next three days.\n\nPlay Video 2:20 Luxembourg PM mocks Boris Johnson after PM skips press conference \u2013 video\n\nIt comes after the PM\u2019s humiliating \u201cempty chair\u201d press conference in Luxembourg exposed the fault lines between the UK and Europe. Johnson was booed and jeered as he left a working lunch with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, before opting out of plans to speak alongside Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister. Xavier Bettel, speaking alongside Johnson\u2019s empty lectern, mocked the PM\u2019s varying suggestions in recent weeks that there had been good progress in the Brexit talks and that it would take the strength of the comic book hero the Incredible Hulk to leave the EU with a deal. As Jon Henley writes, Bettel\u2019s anger highlights a bleak truth: the EU27 just wants Britain to go.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lib Dems leader, Jo Swinson, will close the party\u2019s conference this afternoon with a rallying cry over Brexit. She will argue the \u201ctired old parties\u201d are losing their dominance and that the Lib Dems could win 100 or more seats at an election.\n\nTrump tax returns \u2013 New York prosecutors have issued a subpoena for eight years of the president\u2019s records as part of the investigation into hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. It\u2019s believed the subpoena includes personal and corporate tax returns. Trump is the first president in nearly 40 years not to release his returns, despite promising to do so in his election campaign. The firm that prepares his returns said in a statement that it would \u201cfully comply with its legal obligations\u201d but a lawyer for the Trump Organization, Marc Mukasey, said he was \u201cevaluating the situation and will respond as appropriate\u201d.\n\nIsrael election \u2013 Voters head to the polls today for the second time this year, in a campaign that has seen the PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, demonise Israel\u2019s Arab minority and vow to annex much of the Palestinian territories. April\u2019s ballot failed to produce a government when coalition talks stalled after the far-right former defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, a Netanyahu ally-turned-rival, refused to back the PM. Netanyahu\u2019s biggest rival is security hawk and former head of the army Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party. But with a razor-thin margin expected, another stalemate is a potential outcome, plunging the country into further political crisis.\n\nDark web paedophiles \u2013 The Home Office will fund the use of artificial intelligence including voice analysis and age estimation to see whether they can help track down child abusers. Earlier this month the chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced \u00a330m would be set aside to tackle online child sexual exploitation, with the Home Office releasing more information today on how it would be spent. Law enforcement bodies have welcomed the greater resources but critics described the government\u2019s crackdown on crime as cynical populist politics designed to sway voters before a possible general election.\n\nAmazon crime \u2013 Deforestation is being driven by criminal networks that threaten and attack government officials and indigenous people, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch. \u201cAs long as you have this level of violence, lawlessness and impunity for the crimes committed by these criminal groups it will be impossible for Brazil to rein in deforestation,\u201d says the report\u2019s author, Cesar Mu\u00f1oz Acebes. \u201cThese criminal networks will attack anyone who stands in their way.\u201d The report documents 28 killings in which it found evidence that \u201cthose responsible were engaged in illegal deforestation and saw their victims as obstacles\u201d. Thousands of fires have been burning across the world\u2019s biggest rainforest this year, with deforestation rising to a rate not seen in a decade.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a barbarian\u2019 \u2013 A village in New Zealand has banned a replica of Captain Cook\u2019s ship, the Endeavour, from docking to mark 250 years since the explorer\u2019s arrival after an outcry from the local M\u0101ori community. Anahera Herbert-Graves, the head of Northland\u2019s Ng\u0101ti Kahu iwi, or tribe, told Radio NZ: \u201cHe [Cook] was a barbarian. Wherever he went, like most people of the time of imperial expansion, there were murders, there were abductions, there were rapes, and just a lot of bad outcomes for the indigenous people.\u201d She objected to the idea that the 250-year commemorations events were using \u201ceuphemisms like \u2018encounters\u2019 and \u2018meetings\u2019 to disguise what were actually invasions\u201d.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: How dangerous is chlorinated chicken?\n\nChlorine-washed chicken from the US has become a totemic issue in the post-Brexit trade deals Britain could look to secure. But is it unsafe? And what does it say about the different attitudes to food production on either side of the Atlantic? Also today: Israelis go to the polls for their second election of the year.\n\nToday in Focus How dangerous is chlorinated chicken?

It\u2019s tight, it\u2019s tense and a perfect fat-free distillation of everything that\u2019s good about the franchise. However \u2013 and now for the bad news \u2013 it\u2019s only eight minutes long. Filmed in secret and released this weekend, Battle at Big Rock is an odd duck indeed, Heritage says. Three things make it stand out. First, the campers in the film have no idea that the dinosaurs are coming, so their shock is at least genuine. Second, in its inventive use of a high chair and its distinctive framing of a roar it achieves a one-two punch of indelible series-best moments. And third, the mid-credit scenes are absolutely bonkers \u2026 and its release might be time to get excited about Jurassic World again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andre Holland and Natalie Martinez in Battle at Big Rock.

It has not been the perfect summer for England, and the Test side requires work, but Trevor Bayliss delivered the prize England coveted most \u2013 the World Cup. Liverpool have landed in Italy for their Champions League game against Napoli and, despite a late defeat in last year\u2019s group stage, J\u00fcrgen Klopp insists a triumphant campaign has only made his squad hungry for more. England\u2019s players have been enjoying their welcome in Japan but are ready to focus Sunday\u2019s Rugby World Cup opener with Tonga. Suzann Pettersen is keen to lead Europe at the next Solheim Cup after announcing retirement but Catriona Matthew \u201cwouldn\u2019t say no\u201d if offered the captaincy for a second time. Arthur Masuaku was sent off and Jack Grealish missed a golden late chance in a 0-0 draw between Aston Villa and West Ham at Villa Park while Arsenal\u2019s Dani\u00eblle van de Donk, a substitute, scored a late winner to seal a 1-0 victory over newly promoted Manchester United in the Women\u2019s Super League. And an RAF senior aircraftman has died after being injured playing in an inter-services rugby league match against the army.\n\nBusiness\n\nOil lost some of its massive gains on Tuesday, but the threat of military action over the attacks on Saudi oil facilities (Trump says the US\u2019s response will depend on Saudi Arabia\u2019s assessment of the attacks) kept prices elevated and stocks under pressure. While equity market losses have not been large, shaky investor confidence continued to support safe-haven assets, with gold edging higher. Investors otherwise broadly remained on the sidelines ahead of an expected interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the next round of US-China trade talks on Thursday.\n\nThe pound is buying $1.241 and \u20ac1.127.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nA photo of Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg\u2019s PM, and an empty podium feature on many of the front pages today after Boris Johnson pulled out of a joint press conference.\n\nThe Guardian says: \u201cJohnson left humiliated as Brexit visit ends in chaos\u201d, the Telegraph reports: \u201cLuxembourg laughs in Johnson\u2019s face\u201d, the Times has: \u201cTory anger as Johnson ambushed in Europe\u201d, the i reports: \u201cJohnson hounded out of EU talks\u201d and the Express says: \u201cNo wonder Britain voted to quit the EU\u201d.\n\nThe FT continues reporting on the impact of the drone attacks in Saudi Arabia: \u201cCrude price spikes as fears mount over disruption to Saudi supply\u201d, the Mirror has a story about Gary Lineker: \u201cI\u2019ve told BBC to cut my pay\u201d, and the Mail has a story about the delayed rollout of smart meters: \u201c\u00a313.5bn smart meters fiasco\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
