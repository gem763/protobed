If really prolonged and severe, then permanent brain damage or death can occur.\u2019\n\nBoris Johnson calls Extinction Rebellion protesters 'uncooperative crusties'\n\nThe court heard how a doctor became concerned at the child\u2019s erratic blood sugar levels and sent samples to the hospital laboratory for testing.\n\nThe results revealed high levels of insulin but were unable to confirm whether it was naturally occurring or artificially administered.\n\nThe samples were sent on to the Royal Hospital in Guildford for specialist tests, the court heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, on March 4, 2018, an intravenous tube giving a constant supply of glucose was found disconnected but the child\u2019s blood sugar levels had not plummeted, jurors heard.\n\nThe next day, the defendants were told of the hospital\u2019s suspicion that the hypoglycaemic attacks were caused by insulin, the court heard.\n\nOn March 9, the Guildford lab found the samples were consistent with artificial insulin and medics reported their concerns to police and social services.\n\nIn a search of the child\u2019s hospital cubicle, insulin pens were found in a bag, jurors were told.\n\nMore boxes of insulin pens were allegedly recovered during a search of the defendants\u2019 London flat.\n\nThe defendants were interviewed by police on March 10 last year, with the help of an interpreter.\n\nAmal Asiri told officers she had married when she was aged 14 and lived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where her husband worked in the military.\n\nBoth defendants denied giving the child any insulin. Jurors were told that following their arrest, the child suffered no more hypoglycaemic incidents.\n\nThe defendants deny child cruelty between May 1 2017 and March 9 2018.\n\nAmal Asiri also denies administering a poison or noxious substance to the child between the same dates.\n\nJudge Mark Lucraft QC told jurors the couple had told their lawyers what their case was and they would be represented during the trial.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
