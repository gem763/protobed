So we don\u2019t known which ferries are coming from where to where,\u201d said Steve Bates, chief executive of the UK BioIndustry Association.\n\n\u201cWe have been repeatedly asking for this,\u201d he said, adding that with fewer than six weeks to go before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline \u201ceverything is become increasingly urgent\u201d.\n\nThe Department for Transport on Friday said that it had shortlisted eight companies that could bid to bring in drugs, using ports away from areas that are likely to face disruption.\n\nIt said the contracts - awarded to ferry companies, Eurotunnel and an aircraft charter company - would provide capacity equivalent to thousands of trucks per week.\n\nTwo Brexit deadlines have already been and gone, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now vowed to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal by the end of October - increasing the chance of a sudden departure that will bring trade tariffs and customs checks with the continent for the first time in decades.\n\nThe risk is particularly acute for the pharmaceutical industry, which imports 37 million packs of medicines into the UK from the rest of Europe every month.\n\nBriefing reporters on Friday, leaders of drug industry groups and medical research charities said they have been working for three years on contingency plans and are broadly confident that UK doctors, hospitals and patients will not face immediate or dangerous medical shortages.\n\n\u201cThis is all about managing risk,\u201d said Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. \u201cThe scale of this means that we have to be sensible and prepare for shortages, but the system is well geared up for managing that.\u201d\n\nResponding to the concerns, a government spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that \u201ccomprehensive plans\u201d are in place to ensure that vital medicines are brought into the UK after Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe want to alleviate any fears by stressing that the government is doing everything we can to make sure patients receive the medicines they need,\u201d she said.", "description": "Makers and suppliers of life-saving drugs and medical devices say they have still not been told by British authorities how their goods will be handled if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of October.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432026830&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1KI", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
