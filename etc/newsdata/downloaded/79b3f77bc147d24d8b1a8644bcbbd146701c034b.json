There are other places out there. Maybe I need to live somewhere else and have a more extravagant lifestyle?\n\n\u201cI would definitely like to go to London. I have been thinking about it, but, again, it is about money. I need to score some bonus points.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

His boss Christian Horner now says it is Albon\u2019s seat to lose for 2020.\n\nAlbon was born in London, educated in Ipswich, and has lived in England for most of his life, but he adopted his mother, Kankamol\u2019s Thai nationality. His father, Nigel Albon, is a former British Touring Car driver.\n\n\u201cI have both British and Thai passports but I chose to drive under the Thai flag,\u201d Albon added. \u201cI do feel Thai, but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel British either.\n\n\u201cIn the end it is a racing licence. You have to choose one and I chose Thai. There are no regrets, and I don\u2019t think I will change that.\u201d\n\nHamilton will seal his fifth championship in six seasons on Sunday if he outscores Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 14 points.\n\nBut when the 34-year-old hangs up his helmet, Albon, alongside McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris, 19, and Williams driver George Russell, 21, are primed to ensure the future of British motor racing remains in safe hands.\n\nRussell beat both Norris and Albon to last year\u2019s Formula Two championship, but the Mercedes junior has spent his formative Formula One campaign trailing at the back of the field in an uncompetitive Williams.\n\nAlbon has scored 64 points while Norris has registered 35. Russell is the only driver on the grid yet to get off the mark this year.\n\n\u201cI do tease George, I am not going to lie,\u201d added Albon. \u201cWe banter about it all the time.\n\n\u201cGeorge and I have always been fighting at the front, so it must be extremely tough for him. He can do an amazing lap, but he knows that 19th is all he can achieve. I don\u2019t know that feeling.\n\n\u201cBut he is doing a top job and when he has a chance to show what he can do, he will. I know he is a good driver so I am not worried for him.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "As Lewis Hamilton closes in on his sixth world championship, and yet more riches, Alex Albon hopes to earn the new Red Bull Racing deal which will allow him to move out of his parents\u2019 house.
