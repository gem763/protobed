They also found that only 5% of these women reported their rape to a healthcare professional, largely due to the long distances they have to walk in order to get help.\n\nThe MSF Drivers for Change project is an all-male team who transport victims of sexual abuse to healthcare facilities where they receive the care they need.\n\nThis video was produced by the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism.
