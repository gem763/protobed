One of the great occasions in the history of Colchester, up there with their FA Cup defeat of Leeds United in 1971, and beating Crystal Palace in the previous round, another night when the stars aligned.\n\nThere was a missed penalty in the shootout from the substitute Christian Eriksen, who was given a lukewarm reaction to say the least from the Spurs fans when he went over to acknowledge them at the end. His penalty was saved by goalkeeper Dean Gerken, one of the Colchester heroes, and then there was Brazil international Lucas Moura clattering the fifth against the bar leaving the stage set for one final Colchester spot-kick to reverberate around English football.\n\nThat last penalty was tucked away by Tom Lapslie, a diminutive midfielder who had run himself to a standstill over 90 minutes stopping Dele Alli doing what he does best, and then, with his final bar of energy, deciding the tie in his club\u2019s favour. The team from League Two won in spite of the fact they too missed a penalty, Jevani Brown deciding that this was the perfect time to showcase his panenka. \u201cHe\u2019s got away with that tonight,\u201d reflected his manager John McGreal, later.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere were standout performances all over the Colchester team, from Gerken and Lapslie to the two centre-halves Luke Prosser and Tom Eastman, the latter the only survivor from the Colchester side that lost to Spurs in the FA Cup third round in 2016. The shining talent was Courtney Senior, a 21-year-old from Brentford\u2019s academy who gave notice that he could play at a much higher level, skipping away from tackles, outpacing his Premier League opponents at times and the game\u2019s outstanding player.\n\nColchester players celebrate their win Credit: ACTION IMAGES\n\nFor Pochettino this was a grim reckoning \u2013 leaving him with just two wins from eight games in all competitions this season. He defended his team\u2019s effort, although it yielded only four shots on target, and then Pochettino was back to hinting at the fractures in the squad suffered during pre-season and the preceding years of thrift. \u201cWhen you have an unsettled squad [you] always need time,\u201d he said, \u201cand then you need time to recover the time you lose. That\u2019s where we are. Maybe performances are good but we need this mental connection, this energy to be all together, not to have different agendas in the squad. We need time again to build that togetherness.\u201d\n\nA \u201ctough situation\u201d was how he described it, and while there is no doubt the heights that this manager has scaled with Spurs, these will be worrying times for him. \u201cWe are working hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need time to fix that. January is a good opportunity. Then the next transfer window. That\u2019s the problem when something happens you cannot control \u2013 this situation can arrive. I\u2019m more than happy, it means we are human. To keep successful in football you need to be different every season. Maybe we need to do something different.\u201d\n\nHe made ten changes from the team that lost to Leicester City, all but the goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga. Harry Kane was not part of the matchday squad. There were four academy graduates in the starting XI, two of them, 17-year-old Troy Parrott and Japhet Tanganga, 20, making their first team debuts. Oliver Skipp and Kyle Walker-Peters started too. Eric Dier wore the captain\u2019s armband, his first minutes of any kind this season.\n\nPochettino struggles to hide his disappointment Credit: REUTERS\n\nMcGreal\u2019s side lined up with five in midfield and the indomitable Frank Nouble leading the line alone, and they matched Spurs for fitness. \u201cOur boys have had to do a lot of running around,\u201d McGreal said, \u201cand they have shown great discipline.\u201d Even as the game reached its later stages and with Eriksen, Heung-Min Son and Erik Lamela sent on to secure the win, Colchester kept their shape. Earlier, Walker-Peters had hit the post with a cross but that was as close as Spurs got.\n\nAs for Senior, McGreal said he \u201chad everything as a player\u201d and this was the night to show it. The successful Colchester penalties were scored by substitutes Luke Norris and Paris Cowan-Hall as well as Nouble and Lapslie. As the home crowd poured onto the pitch the PA pleaded with them not to leave but rather to consider turning up for Colchester\u2019s next home game: Stevenage a week on Saturday.\n\nMatch details\n\nColchester United (4-5-1): Gerken 7; Jackson 6, Eastman 8, Prosser 8, Bramall 6; Senior 8, Stevenson 6, Comley 6, Lapslie 7, Gambin 6; Nouble 7.
