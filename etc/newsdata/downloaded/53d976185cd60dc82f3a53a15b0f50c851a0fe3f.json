I have also had many discussions with President Trump, [Iranian] President [Hassan] Rouhani and several others, and we are of course committed both to full respect for the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and to having a wider agenda for stability and security across the region.\u201d\n\nFrance is seeking Trump\u2019s green light to restore waivers for Iran to export oil to some purchasers for some limited amount of time to permit negotiations to take place, diplomats and experts said.\n\nA European official, speaking not for attribution, described this idea as involving a limited amount of time for a limited negotiation with limited incentives, for testing the waters. He added that officials do not believe pressure on Iran will by itself bring the Iranians to surrender.\n\nThe French \u201care pushing forward this diplomatic process,\u201d Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Al-Monitor, mentioning Zarif's Friday meeting with Macron is following a series of long telephone calls between Macron and Rouhani in recent weeks. \u201cThe idea at the G-7 summit is Macron directly with Trump will try to get the green light for these discussions to continue and move forward at the UN General Assembly.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s statement Wednesday \u201cbasically said they are focusing their efforts on an economic package for Iran in return for full compliance on the JCPOA, and will entail in part easing the US sanctions restrictions on Iran oil exports at least temporarily to push forward a political track, in addition to basically commitments from the European partners and other EU governments as well,\u201d Geranmayeh said.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a multipronged economic package,\u201d Geranmayeh said of the French proposal. \u201cPart of it will have to entail at least temporary waivers from the US for certain countries to purchase Iranian oil. And this will not take Iran up to the level to when the US was in the deal. But the bottom line is to over a million barrels per day through these waivers. If I were to bet, the waivers will have to go to Asian economies \u2014 India, Japan, South Korea (possibly China). \u2026 So that is one part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is a very, very high bar,\u201d Geranmayeh said. \u201cIt is difficult to envisage much scope for flexibility on the US side.\u201d This will particularly be the case, she added, if Trump\u2019s hard-line national security adviser John Bolton, who will accompany Trump to the G-7, \u201chas the last word on this. Maybe in the course of the G-7, Macron can appeal to Trump\u2019s ego and might get the green light on some of these issues.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not offer comment in response to queries on its possible receptiveness to Macron\u2019s proposal. But a US official pointed to Trump\u2019s Aug. 8 tweets, saying he knows Macron means well, but no one is authorized to speak for the United States on Iran.\n\nAnother expected part of the French proposals would be some sort of European compensation package, including a credit line. In a 100-minute Macron Rouhani phone call July 30, Macron brought up the idea of establishing a $15 billion credit line for Iran as a way to compensate for the oil Iran exported to Europe before the US withdrew from the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil and banking sectors, Al-Monitor\u2019s Rohollah Faghihi previously reported.\n\nEuropean and Japanese mediation efforts on Iran have been frustrated by divisions within the Trump administration on Iran, said Jarret Blanc, a former US Iran nuclear deal coordinator.\n\n\u201cI think the [French] impression \u2026 is that there are many different uncoordinated voices in the administration,\u201d Blanc, now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Al-Monitor, noting that on the eve of when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe traveled to Iran in June with a message from Trump, Bolton announced new US sanctions on Iran\u2019s petrochemical sector. \u201cThey [the French] were deeply concerned about being screwed by the disorder of the [US] policy process.\u201d\n\nLe Drian responded sharply earlier this month to a Trump tweet saying Macron did not speak for the United States on Iran in what some observers interpreted as churn from internal US administration disagreements on Iran mediation efforts.\n\n\u201cHeightened tensions require political initiatives to restore conditions for dialogue,\u201d Le Drian said in the statement defending French mediation efforts. \u201cThat is what President Macron is doing, in full transparency. \u2026 He is, of course, keeping the US authorities informed. All efforts must be brought together to avoid this conflictual situation from turning into a dangerous confrontation.\u201d\n\nNoting that Macron\u2019s diplomatic adviser Emmanuel Bonne met with Bolton last week and that Bolton will accompany Trump to the G-7 this weekend, Blanc said there may be a logic to that. \u201cMy guess is that nobody will succeed\u201d in persuading the Trump administration to ease off maximum pressure to try to get to Iran negotiations or Iranian concessions, Blanc said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can sweet-talk Bolton into something.\u201d However, he noted that Bolton, when he served as undersecretary of state for arms control during the George W. Bush administration, traveled to France more than any other country, and seems to have a soft spot for France.\n\n\u201cI am skeptical,\u201d Blanc said of whether Bolton would be amenable to a proposal to get to the kind of talks with Iran that Trump says he wants. \u201cCan he prevent it? No, probably not. Will he do any of the work to make it happen?\u201d Unlikely, Blanc indicated.", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron says he will present US President Donald Trump ideas for an economic incentive package to try to advance Iran diplomacy at the G-7 summit in Biarritz this weekend.", "authors": ["Laura Rozen"], "top_image": "https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2019/08/RTS289SX.jpg/RTS289SX-870.jpg"}
