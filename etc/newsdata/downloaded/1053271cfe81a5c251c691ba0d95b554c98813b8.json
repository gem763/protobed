USA TODAY\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh was asked during his weekly news conference on Monday afternoon about the recently passed California Fair Pay to Play Act.\n\nThe new law doesn't go into effect until 2023 and would allow college athletes to profit from their names and likenesses, giving them the ability to earn money from endorsement deals. The NCAA tried to persuade California Governor Gavin Newsom from signing the bill and has protested the effect the bill could have on college athletics.\n\nHarbaugh's initial response when asked about the act: \"You don't know. There's a lot of things, be careful for what you wish for. A lot of loopholes we've seen, they drive trucks through them. I can't visualize how that would be a competitive advantage or how that work.\"\n\nMichigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh.

His proposal: Allow football players to declare for the NFL draft at any point in their careers, while also giving them the ability to return to school if they aren't drafted. Harbaugh would also prefer college athletes retain amateur status.\n\nCurrently, the NCAA prohibits any player from declaring for the draft until they have been out of high school for at least three years. In college football, that means players can't enter the draft until after their redshirt sophomore or junior seasons.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\n\"I think the fair thing to do would be not to restrict players to have to stay in college for three years,\" Harbaugh said. \"They can turn pro at any point. They can be drafted after their freshman year, they can be drafted after their sophomore year, their junior year, their senior year. I would also make a rule that if they weren\u2019t drafted, they could return to college. \u2026 That would be what I would suggest and propose. And you have examples of other sports. You have hockey, you have baseball, you have basketball.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Harbaugh would consider bringing his idea to the College Football Coaches Association, he said he would be \"happy to propose that.\"\n\nNCAA PRESIDENT: California law could turn athletes into employees\n\n\"That\u2019s something I think would be beneficial and fair to everybody,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a restrictive nature to something which is, you have to be a college football player for three years before you\u2019re eligible to be drafted. I would say the other way would be better. If you\u2019re a tennis play, you\u2019d like to be a professional player at 17, you can be a professional tennis player at 17.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a long time that there\u2019s a window to be a professional football player, if somebody\u2019s good enough to do that. And then can return and finish their college degree and probably would be appreciated more and not taken for granted and looked at it for the value that it is.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some that are good enough to be professional athletes, football players, and some that aren\u2019t,\" Harbaugh continued. \"To me, that would be a good resolution to the conversation that we\u2019re having.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh later said that a \"standard way of doing it would be clear and concise and good,\" pointing out the differences between college football and college hockey and college basketball's rules regarding entry in their respective professional drafts.", "description": "Asked about the California Fair Pay to Play act, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said college football players should be free to enter the NFL draft sooner.", "authors": ["Orion Sang", "Published P.M.
