We've got to try and book a holiday today but that means me begging and pleading for time off from Holby. How can we possibly organise a wedding?\"\n\nBut a tragedy that would derail Jeremy entirely struck on June 15 when his Holby co-star, Laura Sadler, plunged 40 ft to her death from a balcony while watching the sun rise at her boyfriend's home in Holland Park, London.\n\nThe 22 year old sustained massive head injuries and died in hospital five days later, leaving Jeremy, then 31, bereft.\n\n(Image: LFI)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Everybody in the cast is completely devastated and is asking the same question, 'Why her?'\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"You couldn\u2019t meet a sweeter, nicer, more wonderful girl. She was the kindest person and even actor friends of mine who did just one episode with her are mortified. She was just the loveliest little thing.\"\n\nCrippled with grief, he began drinking too much and just months later, Rachel ended their relationship.\n\n\"It was a tough time for me. After Laura's death I got really messed up. I was drinking a hell of a lot and got seriously depressed,\" he told heat.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"It really shook me up. Losing such a close friend pushed me off the rails and sadly Rachel got caught up in my mess.\n\n\"It was at this point she confronted me about my problems and we agreed to have a break.\"\n\nThe pair didn't speak for an entire month until Jeremy \"realised what my behaviour was making me lose,\" and they reunited.\n\n\"Rachel means the world to me and I couldn't believe what was happening to our relationship. I needed a serious reality check and that's what I got,\" he added.\n\nHowever, they shelved their plans for marriage with Jeremy stating he needed to \"grow up a bit\" before making a committment.\n\nHe also disapproved of the sexy image overhaul she underwent to launch her solo career, explaining he wanted Rachel to be known for her talent, not her looks.\n\n(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\n\"I just don't think it's necessary,\" he told Now magazine.\n\n\"It seems that the easiest way for a young girl to sell records is to get her kit off and get herself in the tabloids, but I think there's a danger of being known for that instead of your talent.\n\n\"Rachel's a really good singer and I worry that her image will overshadow that. But the suits seem to think that they know what they're doing, so we just have to go along with it.\"\n\nThen in January 2004, the pair confirmed they had parted ways for good, explaining that although the decision was 'sad', it was 'the right one'.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nRachel went on to marry childhood friend Alex Bourne in a lavish ceremony at Claridge's hotel in London's Mayfair in 2009.\n\nThey have two children, daughters Amelie, eight, and Minnie, five.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeremy married Lydia Metz that same year and they have daughter Scarlett.", "description": "Jeremy Edwards and Rachel Stevens were the set to marry when a heartbreaking tragedy sent X Factor: Celebrity star Jeremy spiralling", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Press Association", "Wireimage", "Lfi", "Getty Images", "Bbc", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552862.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SHOWBIZ-Stevens-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
