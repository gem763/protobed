The areas highlighted by Quinn in the earnings release are exactly those mentioned in the earlier reports: the U.S. operations, the wholesale banking operation in the U.K. and the retail operations in continental Europe.\n\n\u201cOur previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,\u201d Quinn said. \"We are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them, and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe bank now expects \u201csubstantial\u201d restructuring charges that will stop it reaching its target of a return on tangible equity of 11% next year. A weak third quarter means that RoTE has dropped to 9.5% for the first nine months of this year. Talking to Bloomberg later, chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson declined to say how long it would take to hit the 11% mark.\n\nThe shares lost 3.4% to their lowest in nearly two months, dragging the U.K. down 0.3% by 4:00 AM ET (0900 GMT). The was down 0.2%, while a strong performance from the auto sector allowed the German to inch fractionally higher.\n\nElsewhere, French luxury goods giant LVMH (PA: ) rose 0.4% after confirming that it had made an approach to Tiffany & Co (NYSE: ), a move that would bulk up its presence in \u201chard luxury\u201d and also strengthen its footprint in the U.S. The Financial Times reported that Tiffany was expected to reject the unsolicited $14.5 billion bid, which was around 30% above the jeweler\u2019s share price when it was made earlier in October. Even at that price, though, it represents a much lower earnings multiple than what LVMH paid for Bulgari in its first foray into jewelry seven years ago.", "description": "StockBeat: HSBC Gets Ready to Shrink; LVMH Eyes a Tiffany Bargain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB58057_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
