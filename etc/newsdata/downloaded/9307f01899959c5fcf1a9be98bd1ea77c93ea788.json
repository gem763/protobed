It's done to affect and to affect it negatively. It's done to show to Europe that this country isn't stable, that this country does not deserve to be taken seriously and it's a whole plan; it's clear; it's not even secret; it's clear; it's open; it's unfolding every day, you know.\"\n\nHowever, during Friday's demonstrations, some protestors waved US, European and German flags.\n\n\"We are asking for our rights, they (Albania's government) killed them for six years since they have been ruling,\" said protestor Novalik Dokaj.\n\nAnother protestor, Enver Ibraj, said:\n\n\"We came out to remove them (the government). It's a government of crime and drugs.\"\n\nFor the first time since the start of the rallies, nothing was thrown at the police, apparently a consequence of intensive calls from Western countries to stop the violence.", "description": "The leader of Albania's ruling left-wing Socialist Party said he was determined the June 30 municipal elections would be held despite opposition unrest since mid-February.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/97/97/74/1000x563_cmsv2_f0e4edc7-0425-5420-89c0-c9b6a2a4c9a8-3979774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-22"}
