Superstar producers and DJs like Avicii and David Guetta were headlining major music festivals and topping charts with collaborations featuring artists like Aloe Blacc and Kelly Rowland. Hardwell was voted DJ Mag\u2019s number one DJ. And Swedish House Mafia \u2014 who arguably helped bring electronic dance music back into the mainstream \u2014 were performing their farewell \u201cOne Last Tour.\u201d\n\nIt was within this space that Kygo (real name Kyrre G\u00f8rvell-Dahll) launched his music career by pioneering a new genre of electronic music that some have dubbed tropical house \u2014 characterized by the sounds of steel drums, pan flutes and the marimba, among other tropical instruments. Kygo described his music to ABC News as \u201chappy,\u201d \u201cmelodic\u201d and \u201cchill.\u201d\n\nOne weekend, two countries, three shows. \"Nightline\" presents \"48 Hours with Kygo,\" streaming on Hulu Friday, Oct. 4.\n\nToday, Kygo holds the record as the fastest artist to reach one billion streams on Spotify \u2014 achieving it in only 12 months \u2014 and he has worked with major artists including Rita Ora, Selena Gomez, Miguel, John Legend and, posthumously, Whitney Houston.\n\nSince signing onto Sony Music in 2014, Kygo released numerous singles that eventually became a part of his first studio album \u201cCloud Nine,\u201d which was released in May 2016. Most recently, he worked on Whitney Houston\u2019s cover of Steve Winwood\u2019s \u201cHigher Love.\u201d\n\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cShe was signed to the same label as I am,\u201d Kygo said. \u201cThey had this song laying around...that she actually covered in 1990 or something, and they never...officially released it. I got sent the track and I was just like, \u2018Wow this is...crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chorus; it\u2019s just so powerful,\u201d he added. \u201cWhitney Houston is, like, one of the most legendary artists of all time. So, to me, it was just kind of unreal to get the opportunity.\u201d\n\nABC News tagged along with Kygo for a weekend in early August during which he performed three shows in two countries. After the weekend ended, he spoke to ABC News about his musical roots, his breakthrough into the music industry and his plans for the future.\n\nKygo\u2019s introduction to music\n\nKygo, who is from Bergen, Norway, had been surrounded by music from an early age. His father was a pianist and he, too, learned how to play piano at 6 years old after his mom encouraged him to take lessons. The more he learned, the more his passion for music grew, he said, until eventually, he was playing piano for hours every day after school.\n\nAlthough he says he grew up listening to a range of music, he credits the late Avicii \u2014 born Tim Bergling, who died in 2018 \u2014 with inspiring him to learn how to produce music. \u201cWhen I heard his songs...I just connected with them in, like, a different way,\u201d Kygo said.\n\nLars G\u00f8rvell-Dahll\n\nWith a MIDI keyboard that his mom bought him for Christmas one year and the production software Logic Studio, he began teaching himself to produce, experimenting as much as possible and learning new techniques through YouTube tutorials. All those hours spent practicing piano were replaced with hours learning production.\n\nKygo began uploading his remixes to SoundCloud, a hub for many aspiring producers to post their music. His early remixes included \u201cLimit to Your Love\u201d by James Blake and \u201cJolene\u201d by Dolly Parton, and as he posted more of them, he said his fanbase slowly began to grow.\n\n\u201cEvery time I posted a remix, it got a little bit more plays than the previous mix,\u201d Kygo said.\n\nFor many Kygo fans, however, it was probably the 2013 remix of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing\u201d that put him on their radar.\n\n\u201cI was actually a student at the time, but I was basically just making music every day. I wasn\u2019t really focusing on school at all,\u201d Kygo said. \u201c[\u2018Sexual Healing\u2019] was, like, such a...classic. But at the time, I got a lot of messages on SoundCloud. A lot of people asked me, \u2018Oh, you gotta remix \u2018Sexual Healing.\u2019 And then one day I [was] just like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll give it a shot and see if it works out.\u201d\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images, FILE\n\nKygo said he initially felt nervous about posting the remix on SoundCloud, but then the positive reactions began to roll in.\n\n\u201cEverybody seemed to be very happy about it. I posted basically a remix every month, and then [\u2018Sexual Healing\u2019] just got more and more plays and I got more and more followers,\u201d Kygo said. \u201cI made a Facebook page and that one got a thousand likes and then suddenly 10,000 likes, and it was just...going upward.\u201d\n\nKygo builds a music career\n\nKygo met his manager, Myles Shear, through Facebook. Shear said he was looking for new music online when he discovered Kygo. He sent a message to Kygo praising his music and suggested they work together, he said, and Kygo accepted the offer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely opposites when it comes to personality,\u201d Kygo said. \u201cWe have our strengths and our weaknesses. I make the music, and then he promotes it\u2026 In the beginning, I posted stuff on SoundCloud and I was just hoping someone would listen to it. When [Shear] came in and helped me, he was...sending it to every music blog out there, and...that got the plays up so much.\u201d\n\nThe two met officially, in person, for Kygo\u2019s first-ever show in a Paris club, Shear said. The room was completely empty before Kygo went on, he said, but it filled up as Kygo played.\n\n\u201cWe could just tell by the energy in the way people were reacting and the way they were singing the songs that we had something,\u201d Shear said. \u201cWe both looked at each other in the eyes, and we go, \u2018We\u2019re going to do this forever.\u2019\u201d\n\nC Flanigan/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe crowd\u2019s response to Kygo\u2019s music surprised him as well. He said people were crowd surfing and overall \u201chaving the best time in the club.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know how people were going to react to my tracks because [they] were so much slower than every other DJ out there,\u201d Kygo said. \u201cBut after that show, I just knew that this is actually [going to] amount to something.\u201d\n\nKygo said \u201ceverything just went fast\u201d from that first show. In a matter of months, he was selling out shows solely based off of the SoundCloud remixes. As he carved out a space for himself within the electronic music scene, record labels began bidding against each other to sign him.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was very important when I signed a deal to have, like, the musical...freedom to do whatever I wanted,\u201d Kygo said. \u201cI signed a deal with Sony and then I released\u2026\u2018Firestone.\u2019\u201d\n\nShear admitted that they were young and naive when they signed that deal, but he also said they were excited. \u201cWhen he signed that deal, I just felt like it was game time,\u201d Shear said.\n\nKyrre G\u00f8rvell-Dahll\n\nSince then, Kygo and Shear partnered with Sony to create the record label Palm Tree Records. Shear said his and Kygo\u2019s overall goal is to \u201ccontinue being creative.\u201d He said they want to leave \u201csomething bigger than just Kygo behind. We want to build an empire together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean both of us, we\u2019re just such music lovers and I feel like we\u2019re both trying to find our way to do what we love, you know, and I think we made this perfect combination where it was like the ultimate dream team...and we\u2019re doing what we love and that has formed into what we\u2019ve become,\u201d Shear said.\n\n48 hours, 3 shows, 2 countries\n\nOn that early August weekend, Kygo performed two shows in Las Vegas with another headlining performance at the Veld Music Festival in Toronto sandwiched between. It\u2019s a grueling schedule that Kygo and Shear have become familiar with. Just last year, Kygo went on a global tour during which he was traveling from January to November, he said.\n\nShear acknowledged how fast they move from one show to the next. Immediately after the first Las Vegas performance, they rushed to the airport to fly out to Toronto. Shear said they made the effort because \u201cwe\u2019re doing it for a bigger cause. We\u2019re doing it to make our fans happy and we\u2019re doing it to continue growing the brand.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that when Kygo is performing in a show, he\u2019s already thinking about the next one. He said a good manager \u201cis constantly thinking, like, what can be done better \u2014 what\u2019s happening next \u2014 and putting in that effort and time to make sure that everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\n\nShear said Kygo\u2019s Veld performance was \u201cexciting\u201d because it was their first time back at the festival since 2016. For his part, Kygo said he was a little more nervous than he usually is with his Las Vegas performances.\n\nJohan Johannesson/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn his trailer, Kygo sat quietly to \u201cconcentrate\u201d and \u201cget into the zone,\u201d he said. Shear said Kygo likes it \u201cnice and quiet\u201d when he\u2019s preparing to go on.\n\n\u201cHe shows energy [in a] different way than I do. \u2026 He\u2019s a little more, like, quiet but I know that he\u2019s excited,\u201d Shear said. \u201cI know that he\u2019s grateful of the situation we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nWhen Kygo made it onto the stage, he brought up special guest vocalists and played the piano as approximately 40,000 fans cheered and fireworks blasted off. Then, once he was done, with just over six hours to spare before their next show, his team packed up and headed back to Vegas.", "description": "ABC News joined Kygo for a weekend in which he had three shows in two countries.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/kygo-perform-file-gty-jef-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
