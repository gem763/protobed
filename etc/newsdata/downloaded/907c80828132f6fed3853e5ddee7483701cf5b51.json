As more states follow suit, legal cannabis spending is expected to grow over 200% from about $9 billion in 2017 to $31 billion in 2022.\n\nWith these unparalleled increases in spending, marijuana stocks, including marijuana exchange-traded funds, with catchy tickers such as YOLO YOLO, -1.90% , an acronym for \u201cyou only live once,\u201d are becoming more common.\n\nSo should people add these stocks to their portfolios?\n\nThe rise of socially responsible investing\n\nAs a business ethicist, I know that socially responsible investing has become more popular, especially with millennials. Socially responsible investments experienced a 38% increase between 2016 and 2018. At the beginning of 2018 alone, $11.6 trillion was invested in socially responsible funds. This translates into $1 out of $4 of all U.S. invested funds.\n\nInvestors committed to being socially conscious have more choices than ever and can expect similar returns to traditional investors.\n\nRead: How to make sure your ESG fund does what you think it does\n\nMoral basis for investing\n\nWhile there is no set definition on what socially responsible investing entails, it goes beyond the fundamental view of Milton Friedman, an iconic economist, who claimed \u201cthe business of business is business\u201d \u2014 in other words, making money or \u201cprofit.\u201d\n\nRead: Maximizing shareholder value can no longer be a company\u2019s main purpose: top CEOs\n\nIn addition to profit, socially responsible investing focuses on what is known as the \u201ctriple bottom line.\u201d This means that companies also consider \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cplanet,\u201d as part of responsible business practices.\n\nScholar David Vogeldefines socially responsible investing as \u201cpractices that improve the workplace and benefit society in ways that go above and beyond what companies are legally required to do.\u201d\n\nSocially responsible investors typically buy stocks in companies that have policies to mitigate climate change or support fair trade, but may avoid companies engaged in fossil fuels, tobacco, alcohol and arms production.\n\nMost people would agree that such companies ultimately cause more social and environmental harm than good.\n\nFor instance, fossil fuels, while meeting the demands for a relatively cheap and consistent energy source, unequivocally contribute to air pollution and negatively impact human and environmental health.\n\nRead: Blame your index fund for why companies don\u2019t do more to fight climate change\n\nThe case of tobacco is similar. It is highly addictive and may seriously compromise a healthy and long life.\n\nThe case of marijuana\n\nTaking a view on marijuana is more complex. The substance is used both medically and recreationally.\n\nMarijuana use can cause harm, especially when used at a young age. The National Institutes of Health acknowledges that 30% of users develop dependence and withdrawal symptoms with the long-term use of marijuana. It can also lead to long-term and adverse changes to the brain.\n\nThe American Lung Association advises against smoking marijuana due to the risks it poses for lung health.\n\nHowever, marijuana also has some health benefits.\n\nEven though marijuana is not recognized by the Federal Drug Administration as a medicine, the National Institutes of Health recognizes chemicals derived from the plant can help increase appetite, decrease pain, inflammation and nausea. The NIH also acknowledges that such derivatives may be useful in treating certain mental illnesses and addictions and some studies have shown it may be a weapon against opioid dependence.\n\nClinical trials hold the promise of finding more therapeutic benefits and possible treatments.\n\nMedical marijuana stocks\n\nSo does owning marijuana stocks raise the same ethical issues as owning stocks in an alcohol or tobacco firm \u2014 or are they more like pharmaceutical stocks?\n\nThere are gray areas in socially responsible investing. Not all socially conscious investors have the same values, and not all companies create equal amounts of good.\n\nI do think any socially responsible investor should stay away from recreational marijuana stocks due to the potential for addiction coupled with other health risks.\n\nMedical marijuana stocks, on the other hand, appear to have more benefits than harms. When used for medical reasons, the therapeutic benefits seem to outweigh the health risks. In my view, socially responsible investors should feel free to include a medical marijuana stock in their portfolios if it aligns with their values.\n\nSandra Woien is a lecturer of philosophy at Arizona State University.
