The high price fetched by the painting may also be explained by the fact that work by the artist, also known as Cenni di Pepo, went on sale for the first time in decades on Sunday.\n\nAlso on rt.com Disputed Da Vinci painting shows up on Saudi crown prince\u2019s superyacht \u2014 report\n\nThe discovery of the early Renaissance masterpiece was announced last month and became a sensation in the art world. It was owned by a woman from the town of Compiegne in northern France, who thought of it as just some old religious icon. The painting was hanging between her kitchen and her sitting room, collecting dust and grime for years. When she took the piece to the auctioneers they were stunned to find out that it was actually part of a diptych with scenes of the passion and crucifixion of Christ, which was painted by Cimabue. Its authenticity was confirmed through infrared reflectology. And when the grime was removed it turned out that the painting, which was made on wood and measured just 26 by 20cm, was in excellent condition.\n\nLike this story?
