But pot enthusiasts \u2014 domestic and foreign \u2014 hope the fading resistance to marijuana\u2019s medical use will result in looser laws for public enjoyment and business profits.\n\nThose changes appear to be gaining momentum.\n\nGovernment officials last week attended a ceremony in Chiang Mai, a northern city where Maejo University researchers planted the 12,000 marijuana sprouts. The shoots are nurtured inside a newly built 32,722-square-foot greenhouse with controls for temperature, moisture and light. The government\u2019s Department of Medical Services provided the seeds.\n\nOfficials expect the plants will produce medical-grade cannabis flowers and buds within six months.\n\nThe Government Pharmaceutical Organization hopes to use those ingredients to make 1 million bottles of cannabis oil, each containing 5 milliliters, by February.\n\n\u201cThese are historic first steps on the path towards allowing people to grow six cannabis trees in their homes,\u201d said newly appointed Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul. \u201cIn the near future, families will be able to plant it in their back gardens like any other herb.\n\n\u201cThe university will be a center where ordinary people can learn how to plant and grow good quality cannabis,\u201d said Mr. Anutin, sporting a white lab coat. \u201cCannabis is not an issue of politics; it is a product that can benefit people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nMr. Anutin led his small, newly formed Bhumjaithai (Proud to be Thai) party\u2019s campaign this year during parliamentary elections by promising that each household could grow six plants. By selling the mature plants to the government for $2,225 each, a family could earn $13,350 for all six, he told voters.\n\nMr. Anutin predicted fully legalized marijuana would be a bigger and more lucrative crop for Thailand than rice, sugar cane, tapioca, rubber or other agricultural staples. Thailand\u2019s marijuana strains have a global reputation for quality and potency, but recent governments were nervous about reopening the door to cultivation on a broad scale.\n\nThailand\u2019s low wages would boost its ability to compete in international markets against big foreign cannabis companies. But potential rivals in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere in Asia may force Thailand to create \u201cniche\u201d strains to export, analysts said.\n\nMaejo University reportedly developed a marijuana strain it calls Issara (Independence). It offers equal percentages of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Future strains will offer differing percentages of CBD and THC to treat illnesses and symptoms requiring other ratios.\n\n\u201cWe have plans to extend the cannabis-growing to outdoor areas too, which is likely to be suitable for the local strains that are found in many parts of the country,\u201d Arnat Tancho, director of the Maejo Natural Farming Research and Development Center told the Bangkok Post last week.\n\nAt least 13 hospitals have reportedly received licenses to dispense cannabis extracts to patients with prescriptions.\n\nThe country\u2019s legendary, mind-bending \u201cThai Sticks\u201d strain of illegal weed was hailed by U.S. and international counterculture connoisseurs during the 1960s. But Thailand now trails far behind other countries where medical and recreational marijuana have been legalized and where strains with CBD and THC levels suitable for medical use have been refined.\n\nConcerned about foreign competition, Thailand approved a $4 million budget in August to expand government-controlled marijuana farms for medical purposes.\n\nLast month, Thailand announced that its first relatively small pharmaceutical laboratory produced CBD and THC oils, tablets, oral sprays, chocolate wafers and traditional potions for medical use. They proudly displayed the lab\u2019s tiny garden of 72 plants.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
