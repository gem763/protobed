It remained British for almost 350 years. Although independent since 1966, it is still a member of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe origin of the name Barbados reputedly comes from the Portuguese explorer, Pedro A Campos, who used the phrase 'Los Barbados' meaning 'bearded ones'.\n\nThe stunning Bottom Bay in Barbados. The island has been beloved of the British since Captain Henry Powell first occupied it in 1625\n\nIt is thought that he was referring to the roots of the bearded fig-tree indigenous to the island, or the bearded Caribs or, most improbably, to the foam spraying over the reefs, which somewhat resembles a beard.\n\nNo one is quite certain.\n\nBarbados has always had a distinctly British heritage and it is not hard to see why it is such a popular holiday destination.\n\nThe Bajans are the friendliest people in the Caribbean, and the island is the safest and cleanest. Cricket and polo are fixtures on the Bajan social diary, with high tea served in several hotels.\n\nBarbados has always had a distinctly British heritage. Pictured is the promenade of the marina in the capital, Bridgetown\n\nPlace names will seem familiar - I spotted Windsor, Cambridge, Sussex and Buckingham Hill.\n\nCricket is played at the Kensington Oval. Even the forested highlands in the north of the island are somewhat euphemistically called Scotland.\n\nPolo has been played in St James Parish since 1884 - Prince Harry once fell off his polo horse here. While Barbados does have strong British roots, the charming Bajans give it a local twist.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nThe Sandpiper\n\nThe Sandpiper is one of the most exclusive and discreet boutique hotels in the Caribbean. It opened in 1970\n\nThe piece de resistance at The Sandpiper is the Curlew Tree Top Suite, pictured, which is the most luxurious holiday suite in all of Barbados\n\nThe Sandpiper is one of the most exclusive and discreet boutique hotels in the Caribbean. Its 47 rooms and luxurious suites are discreetly set in seven acres of lush gardens filled with tropical flora, giving it a wonderful sense of tranquillity.\n\nThe hotel, which opened in 1970, is situated on a stunning sandy coral beach on the platinum west coast, gently lapped by turquoise waters.\n\nMuch of the Sandpiper's charm and panache can be attributed to the owners Wayne and Karen Capaldi and general manager, Russell Croney, who run it with meticulous attention to detail without sacrificing the relaxed manner of the Caribbean.\n\nThe bamboo-fronted Harold's Bar at The Sandpiper. Frank says it is a wonderful place for a sundowner, after a dip in one of the two pools\n\nThe restaurant at The Sandpiper, pictured, is 'one of the best on the island', according to Frank\n\nTogether with the desire of their incredibly well-trained staff to pamper their guests, it was not surprising on my visit here to meet several distinguished British guests who return here year after year.\n\nThe restaurant is one of the best on the island, and is reasonably priced, with dishes prepared with a unique Caribbean flair, and with exquisite presentation. The bamboo-fronted Harold's Bar is a wonderful place for a sundowner, after a dip in one of the Sandpiper's two pools.\n\nThe piece de resistance is the Curlew Tree Top Suite, which is the most luxurious holiday suite in all of Barbados.

But why rent a car when you can take one of the ZR or maxi taxis, the brightly coloured blue or yellow government buses that will take you from the capital, Bridgetown, all the way up to Speightstown.\n\nOn board the fun-loving conductor and passengers revel in the reggae music being played at top volume.\n\nIt's the easiest and most enjoyable way to get around the island, passing the historic wooden Chattel Houses, Holetown and many five-star resorts, including the Sandy Lane Resort, beloved of Simon Cowell and Gary Lineker. The bus will leave you yards from the next enchanting destination, Cobblers Cove.\n\nCobblers Cove - a tropical country club\n\nCobblers Cove is a former holiday home that now advertises itself as offering 'English elegance with Caribbean character'\n\nThe pool area at Cobbler's Cove.

It dates back to 1703 and is sold in 110 countries around the globe.\n\nA trip to the distillery is well worth it to try the 'rum that invented rum' or 'Kill Devil', as the Bajans originally called it, crafted from sugar cane and coral-filled water native to this island paradise.\n\nAnother distillery worth visiting is St. Nicholas Abbey Great House Plantation and Distillery, a marvellous Jacobean mansion, dating back to 1660.\n\nThe newly introduced beautiful steam locomotive, The St. Nicholas Abbey Heritage Railway\n\nThe breathtaking view across Cherry Tree Hill towards the island's rugged east coast on the Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe plantation's peaceful surroundings make for a most enjoyable afternoon, and kids will love the newly introduced beautiful steam locomotive, The St. Nicholas Abbey Heritage Railway.\n\nThe train tour will pass the historic Great House itself, around the lake, home to wild waterfowl, orchards and through a lovely mahogany woodland, finishing at Cherry Tree Hill where there is a breathtaking highland view of the island's rugged east coast.\n\nThere is a complimentary guided tour of the great house and visitors can gaze at a portrait of Abraham Cumberbatch, the one-time owner of this plantation.

It opened in 1995 and has won multiple accolades and awards\n\nSince first opening its doors in 1995, The Cliff has been widely acclaimed as one of the finest restaurants in the Caribbean. Winner of multiple accolades and awards, The Cliff is often justifiably listed as one of the top restaurants in the world. Paul Owens, the long-time chef here, is originally from Liverpool.\n\nHe is modest about his achievements, saying that 'by far the best award we can ever get is a happy customer who keeps coming back'. One such customer is appropriately Sir Cliff Richard, who has owned a villa on the island for over 20 years.\n\nThe Cliff is a magical place in an enchanting setting. Cleverly designed as a series of gentle terraces that descend elegantly towards an extended patio above the sea with black coral candelabras, the coral-stone walls of the restaurant are decorated with some locally designed artworks and handcrafted mirrors.\n\nAt night the flaming torches add a lovely touch of drama to the theatrical atmosphere of the restaurant. All the tables are candlelit and each one has a stunning view of the waves crashing below. The food is divine and the service is impeccable.\n\nThe best place for Sunday lunch on the island is the beach-fronted The Lone Star restaurant. It offers a mix of European fare with a Caribbean influence, and some refreshing salads.\n\nThe Little Stars Menu and fresh pizzas from the wood stone fire oven will win over kids in this family-friendly restaurant. Gary Lineker, Michael Caine and Simon Cowell have been spotted here, albeit not at the same time.\n\nWHAT TO DO\n\nPop singer Rihanna hails from Barbados. She says the best thing to do on the island is attend the annual Crop Over festival in August. She is pictured enjoying this year's festival wearing a spectacular pink dress\n\nBarbados is often referred to as the Culinary Capital of the Caribbean so the Barbados Food and Rum Festival, enjoying its 10th year, is worth exploring in October.\n\nThe annual Crop Over festival takes place each summer. It's the traditional harvest festival that traces its origins to the local sugar cane plantations during slavery times. Local girl Rihanna was seen partying in a spectacular pink feathered dress this year.\n\nShe lived in Barbados until she was 16, and in 2017 the street she grew up in, St Michael, was renamed 'Rihanna Drive' in her honour.\n\nAs she once told a journalist: 'If you can be there for Kadooment Day (the first Monday in August) you will experience the most amazing carnival ever. There are party trucks coming down the street, incredible live music and DJs. It's one of those things everybody should try to experience.'\n\nBarbados can be enjoyed any time of the year. And if you time it right (February to April being the driest months) to paraphrase Rihanna, you might not need an umbrella, ella, ella\u2026", "description": "Movie producer Frank Mannion reveals the gems, from the eatery Michael Caine dines at to the festival Rihanna loves.
