The final loss came Oct. 7, as Mel Ott blasted a 10 th-inning home run off Jack Russell at Griffith Stadium in Washington. That home run could be directly attributed to the greed of the Senators\u2019 owner: The ball landed in temporary stands that been constructed in front of the usual seating area in center field \u2014 a move designed to allow for more tickets to be sold for the Fall Classic.\n\nInstead, the Nationals will be aiming to duplicate the feat of the 1924 Washington Senators, the one and only Washington team to actually win a World Series. Their big star was Walter \u201cBig Train\u201d Johnson, who lost Game 1 and Game 5 but came out of the bullpen for a Game 7 victory. The winning run was scored by Herold Dominic \u201cMuddy\u201c Ruel in the 12 th inning on a ground ball that bounced over the head of the Giants\u2019 third baseman.\n\nThe Nationals will face either the Houston Astros or the New York Yankees. The World Series is set to start next week.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6a/38/418edcbf4448bfd217a30976b69e/webp.net-resizeimage%20(18).jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
