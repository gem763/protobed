At the time of his death, he was chairman of the House Oversight Committee. On the panel, which is charged with maintaining integrity in government, Mr. Cummings may have left his most lasting legacy. The position gave him sweeping power to investigate Mr. Trump and his administration, and he used it. Mr. Cummings\u2019s death left a gaping void on the committee.\n\n____\n\nThird-rate name calling. Or is it third-grade?\n\nIt was supposed to be a briefing for lawmakers on the administration\u2019s Syria policy. But a roughly 20-minute meeting on Wednesday, the first with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Trump since the impeachment inquiry began, devolved into name-calling and finger-pointing. Ms. Pelosi said Mr. Trump called her a \u201cthird-grade\u201d politician, but the White House and Senator Chuck Schumer said the insult was actually \u201cthird-rate.\u201d Ms. Pelosi told Mr. Trump that Russia had always wanted a foothold in the Middle East and that it now had one because of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. \u201cAll roads with you lead to Putin,\u201d she said, referring to Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir V. Putin. At another point, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI hate ISIS more than you do.\u201d Somewhere in there, Mr. Trump also insulted Jim Mattis, his former defense secretary, calling him, \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d (Later in the week, Mr. Mattis said: \u201cI have earned my spurs on the battlefield,\u201d adding, \u201cDonald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d)", "description": "Mick Mulvaney creates a storm.
