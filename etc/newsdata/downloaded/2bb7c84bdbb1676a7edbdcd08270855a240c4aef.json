Sebastian Gunningham, a veteran of Amazon.com Inc., will tend to marketing and technology.\n\nMr. Neumann will also cede majority control of the company, with his supervoting shares reduced to 3-to-1 from 10-to-1, the people said.\n\nMr. Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah, a co-founder who also held the title of chief brand and impact officer, is expected to step away from her roles at the company\u2014including as CEO of its private elementary school, the type of unusual venture that defined Mr. Neumann\u2019s desire to make We more than just an office-space company.\n\nMr. Neumann\u2019s position became tenuous after We postponed a planned IPO earlier this month amid concerns from prospective investors about its governance and ballooning losses. The company, once valued privately at $47 billion, slashed its hopes for a public valuation to as low as $15 billion.\n\nFurther undercutting his position: eccentric behavior that was detailed in a Wall Street Journal article last week, such as a party-heavy lifestyle that included marijuana use in an airplane and unpredictable management decisions.\n\nThe end came swiftly for Mr. Neumann, who co-founded WeWork in 2010 and was the force behind its quirky vibe and vision.\n\nAs recently as last week it seemed unlikely that he would ever loosen his iron grip on the company. Key backers, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO James Dimon and Bruce Dunlevie, a venture capitalist who sits on We\u2019s board, indicated that he had their support. In internal meetings and those with outside advisers, Mr. Neumann was still expressing confidence that the company could pull off the IPO later this year with him at the helm.\n\nBut things changed after the company chose to postpone the listing. What followed was a five-day stretch in which the backers whose money and loose reins had fueled Mr. Neumann\u2019s rise turned against him, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nA pivotal moment came when he lost the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. , which owns nearly a third of We and had been a major supporter of Mr. Neumann. The Japanese conglomerate by last week was holding internal discussions about how to remove him.\n\nIn addition to being We\u2019s biggest shareholder, SoftBank has influence by virtue of its ability to keep pumping in the cash We needs. SoftBank had been expected to contribute as much as a third of the $3 billion We hoped to raise in the IPO.\n\nMr. Neumann huddled with close advisers over the weekend and into Tuesday in talks led by Mr. Dimon. Mr. Neumann had counted the bank chief as a confidant and taken to calling him his \u201cpersonal banker\u201d according to people familiar with their relationship.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What will the future of WeWork look like without Adam Neumann at the helm? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Dimon had his own reasons for being hands-on: JPMorgan is deeply entwined with We. Its investment funds were early backers; it had promised to lend the company and Mr. Neumann hundreds of millions of dollars; and it was the lead bank on the IPO. The full-court press on We, dating back years, was part of Mr. Dimon\u2019s strategy to cozy up to promising startups that might pay JPMorgan to take them public and broker deals.\n\nAs of Friday and into the weekend, multiple members of We\u2019s board, including Mr. Dunlevie, indicated that they planned to support Mr. Neumann as CEO. Mr. Dimon and JPMorgan\u2019s money-management arm also told him they didn\u2019t think he had to leave. By Sunday, Mr. Dunlevie, once a staunch ally, met with Mr. Neumann to tell him he would stand with SoftBank in pushing for the entrepreneur to leave.\n\nTuesday morning, Mr. Neumann convened with bankers and lawyers to finalize the details of his departure, one of the people said.\n\nMr. Neumann had long been betting that investors would focus on We\u2019s rocket-ship growth and value it like a technology company.\n\nInstead, analysts, prospective investors and media commentators harped on the company\u2019s losses, $1.6 billion last year. They were growing as fast as revenue, suggesting the company wasn\u2019t getting the benefits of scale that startups rely on to turn profitable.\n\nWith its core business of leasing office space tricked out in millennial-friendly d\u00e9cor, many would-be investors saw the company not as a tech darling, but as an overvalued real-estate company with potential conflicts of interest. Evidence of success in prior efforts to expand into new areas\u2014dormlike apartments, fitness, retail\u2014was scant.\n\nInvestors approached by We\u2019s bankers at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. balked at the price. We slashed its expected valuation by roughly two thirds, erasing $30 billion or more.\n\nThe fate of the IPO now remains to be seen, but people familiar with the matter said it is unlikely to take place this year as planned.\n\nWe is in talks with JPMorgan and Goldman about a new $3 billion loan, which would likely require the startup to raise several hundred million dollars of new equity. SoftBank is expected to chip in for more equity, and big real-estate firms may, too, one of the people said. Together with the cost cuts, that could give We enough cash to keep operating through the end of next year.\n\nThe company is considering shedding extraneous businesses and cutting costs, in part by axing a few thousand of its more than 12,000 employees, another person said.\n\nIn an email to staff, the two incoming CEOs suggested cutbacks could be coming for the company. \u201cWe will closely review all aspects of our company with the intention of strengthening our core business,\u201d they wrote, saying they anticipated \u201cdifficult decisions ahead.\u201d\n\nThe tumult atop We represents the latest threat to the widespread practice among Silicon Valley startups of giving nearly unchecked control to founders. Venture capitalists who once kept founders on a short leash now frequently hand over control to founders under the belief that they should be able to make big, long-term decisions without interference.\n\nTaken with a similar ouster of the CEO of Uber Technologies Inc. in 2017, now two of the most valuable U.S. startups have dethroned founders over concerns about their leadership styles.\n\nMr. Neumann will remain a wealthy man. Entities he controls own roughly 30% of the company\u2019s shares\u2014it\u2019s unclear how much of this is his and how much belongs to the other founder and early investors\u2014and he has already taken out hundreds of millions of dollars from the company in stock sales, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nHe also has borrowed $380 million tied to his shares in the company, according to securities filings, one of the issues prospective investors objected to.\n\nSome of his wealth has gone into real estate. He has at least five homes on both coasts, including a $21 million home near San Francisco with a room shaped like a guitar. And Mr. Neumann has a collection of commercial properties in San Jose, Calif., that he has been expecting to turn into a downtown campus of We buildings, according to people briefed on the plans.\n\n\u2014Liz Hoffman and Julie Steinberg contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com, Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com, David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com and Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "description": "WeWork co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann was forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office startup after its much-anticipated initial public offering was derailed, capping a swift fall from grace for the leader of one of the country\u2019s most valuable startups.", "authors": ["Eliot Brown", "Dana Cimilluca", "David Benoit", "Maureen Farrell", "Eliot.Brown Wsj.Com", "Dana.Cimilluca Wsj.Com", "David.Benoit Wsj.Com", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109851/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
