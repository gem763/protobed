It will now be sent to the Lords and is set to become law within days.\n\nWhile Swinson took to the airwaves to talk up her party\u2019s chances of making a significant breakthrough, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, insisted the Conservatives were the only party that could push through Brexit.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told broadcasters that Labour expected to confound the polls as it did in the 2017 election, and warned that Swinson\u2019s Lib Dems could go into coalition with the Conservatives.\n\nSwinson rejected the idea of supporting either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in government and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that her party\u2019s \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message was resonating in \u201cseats with all sorts of permutations\u201d.\n\nShe said the local elections in May showed that the party could win in areas beyond its current scope of 19 MPs, a total boosted by defections and a byelection win after the Lib Dems won 12 seats in the 2017 election.\n\nChallenged on whether she could really move the party into government from such a low base, Swinson said: \u201cThis is a volatile time in politics. Nobody needs to look at received wisdom or what\u2019s happened in the past.\n\n\u201cOur polling show that we are within a small swing of winning hundreds of seats, because the political landscape is so totally changed by what has happened in our country post-Brexit.\u201d\n\nNeither Johnson nor Corbyn were \u201cfit to lead our country and be prime minister\u201d, Swinson argued. \u201cAnd I know there are millions of people out there who are longing for a positive alternative that is looking to the future.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, Hancock said a vote for the Lib Dems or another party was \u201ca vote to put Corbyn in Downing Street and have more referenda and more blockage and delay\u201d.\n\nHe said the Labour leader would be \u201ccompletely unable to unblock the deadlock, because he can\u2019t govern without SNP, without the Liberal Democrats.\u201d\n\nSpeaking later to the BBC, Hancock dismissed the idea of a notable Lib Dem surge. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of them getting a majority. Instead, if you want to move this country forward, get things moving, there\u2019s only way to do it, and that\u2019s by voting Conservative.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell said that while Labour had initially been resistant to an election, the party was ready. \u201cWe wanted to give the government a chance to bring forward its bill. But they curtailed the time, and so all we could say was at least let\u2019s get no deal off the agenda, and that\u2019s what happened. So, let\u2019s bring it on,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s Breakfast.\n\nAsked about poor poll ratings for Corbyn, he said: \u201cSo many people have tried to write Jeremy Corbyn off. They tried to write him off before the last election, and he transformed the campaign. And I think that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do this time. We\u2019re up for it.\u201d\n\nHe said voters should be wary of Swinson\u2019s aims, saying: \u201cIf the Lib Dems have said they no longer support a people\u2019s vote and they want to side with the Tories \u2013 it looks as though they\u2019re going into coalition again, like they did in 2010.\u201d", "description": "Leader talks up chances of breakthrough as party election machines swing into action", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e7589c43e632b64a4ed2139e77d6e9a39c0ab9/0_261_7421_4453/master/7421.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05faa61b83f8abf7ffa5f9217d7a5fc6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
