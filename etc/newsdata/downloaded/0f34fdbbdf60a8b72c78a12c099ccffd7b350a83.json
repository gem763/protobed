We have not lowered entry standards.\"\n\nWanipa Ndhlovu, president of the university's African-Caribbean Society (ACS), said the rise was \"a testament to the hard work that ACS, as well as the university, has been putting in to break down perceptions\".\n\n\"It should send out a signal to other black students that they can find their place at Cambridge and succeed.\"", "description": "Grime artist Stormzy is paying for two black students to study at Cambridge University each year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/139E1/production/_103035308_stormzycambridge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
