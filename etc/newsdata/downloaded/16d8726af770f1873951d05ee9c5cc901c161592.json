Is it that hard to see the correlation?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m baffled about how the first thing white people say is, \u2018That\u2019s not racist!\u2019 when they can\u2019t even experience racism,\u201d Riley said in a follow-up tweet. A local news report published last week revealed that Riley was paid $346,200 to step down from his position.
