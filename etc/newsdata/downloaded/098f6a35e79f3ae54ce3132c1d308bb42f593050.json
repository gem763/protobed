That is not something that organization does.\"\n\nStelter said Fox News often points to names like Chris Wallace and Bret Baier as proof they have real journalists.\n\nZucker told Stelter that repeating that fact \"is one of the mistakes you make in your journalism.\"\n\n\"Listen, are there a handful of really good journalists in that organization? Sure. Is there one or two really good anchors at that organizations? Sure, but that doesn't make it a news organization,\" Zucker continued.\n\nWhen asked what Fox News is as an organization, Zucker said they are basically a conspiracy, state-run TV network.\n\n\"Listen, it's, I've said before, it's akin to state-run TV, I think it's morphed into conspiracy TV and it's not a place where somebody like Shep Smith could work,\" Zucker said, adding, \"I don't think it's a journalistic organization.\"\n\nZucker said he would be open to hire Smith once his non-compete expires.\n\nTrey Yingst, Fox News's foreign correspondent, responded to Zucker in a lengthy Twitter thread, stating, \"If you don't think Fox News is a \"journalistic organization,\" I'd encourage you to take a look at the work my colleagues have done over the past year. Holding those in power accountable, risking their lives to get the story and reporting the facts.\"\n\nThe bottom line is that I'm proud to report alongside these journalists each day. They put in long hours to practice the craft at the highest level. Their work speaks for itself. \u2014 Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) October 24, 2019\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/24/2019 20:34:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Sarah Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/297/596577af-85dd-446e-ac32-3f45155ce85c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
