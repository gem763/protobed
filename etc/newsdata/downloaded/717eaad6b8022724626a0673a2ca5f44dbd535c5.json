Pictured, the actresses on stage together in March\n\n2005: The stars appear to have hardly aged a day in the 14 years since this photo was taken. They both stick to a regime of fasts, daily green juices and gruelling workouts six days a week\n\nHappily, they allow themselves a 'cheat day' once a week to have what they like when they like \u2013 which in Jennifer's case turns out to be celery juice.\n\nAsked about how they start their days, they told Radio Times they'd never heard of a fry-up and never even eat breakfast.\n\n'I do intermittent fasting, so no food in the morning,' former Friends star Jennifer said. 'I noticed a big difference in going without solid food for 16 hours.'\n\nReese added: 'I just have a green juice and a coffee in the morning.\n\nThen and now: Aniston at the start of her Friends fame in the 90s (left) and right this month. The actress once enjoyed high protein breakfasts but now prefers to skip the meal entirely\n\nBetter with age: Reese Witherspoon picking up her Best Actress Oscar in 2006. The always radiant actress looks even healthier, fitter and stronger today (right in May this year)\n\n'Jen knows so much about health and fitness that I always defer to her. She's great at wellbeing advice.\n\nWhat is '16:8' intermittent fasting? The 16:8 diet is a form of intermittent fasting. Followers of the eating plan fast for 16 hours a day, and eat whatever they want in the remaining eight hours - typically between 10am and 6pm. This may be more tolerable than the well-known 5:2 diet - where followers restrict their calories to 500\u2013to-600 a day for two days a week and then eat as normal for the remaining five days. In addition to weight loss, 16:8 intermittent fasting is believed to improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and help us live longer. Drawbacks of the fasting plan may be that people overindulge in the hours they can eat, leading to weight gain. It can also result in digestive problems over the long-term, as well as hunger, fatigue and weakness.\n\nThe approach marks a shift in lifestyle for Aniston, who previously ate five small meals a day to stay in shape.\n\nSpeaking in 2005, her 'better living expert' revealed the actress would eat a high protein meal like 'scrambled eggs with dried chilli' for breakfast, washed down with hot water and lemon.\n\nLunch would be a similarly healthy plate of steamed vegetables with white fish, while dinner would involve something like a Mexican taco filled with grilled chicken.\n\nHowever the actress is now one of several high-profile fans speaking out in favour of intermittent fasting.\n\nTo help her 'thrive', Jennifer doesn't wake until 9am, while Reese \u2013 who found fame in the 1999 film Legally Blonde \u2013 has it harder, rising at 5.30am with her son Tennessee, seven.\n\nShe then has a workout at 7.30am, adding: 'I probably do that six days a week.'\n\nThe actress is often spotted out and about in workout gear, with jogging and surfing among her favourite activities for keeping active.\n\nGoing green: Reese has long been an advocate of juicing and works out six days a week. Pictured, the actress smiles after an exercise session in April 2017\n\nJennifer said she aims for five workouts every week, and even when she's not fasting starts the day with a celery juice, followed by meditation and a workout.\n\nA dietitian weighs in The so-called 16:8 diet may not be for everyone, according to dietician Susie Burrell, who said following such a restrictive regime was 'easier said than done'. She said: 'Rather than dinner at 8pm and not eating until 12pm the next day, you will get the best results if you eat dinner by 5pm to 6pm and not eat until 9am or 10am so you still reap the metabolic benefits of consuming calories in the first half of the day.'\n\nHowever, the so-called 16:8 diet may not be for everyone, according to dietician Susie Burrell, who said following such a restrictive regime was 'easier said than done'.\n\nThe 16:8 diet advocates fasting for 16 hours and eating freely for the remaining eight hours, typically between 10am and 6pm.\n\nIn addition to weight loss, intermittent fasting is believed to improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and increase life expectancy.\n\nBut Miss Burrell said: 'Rather than dinner at 8pm and not eating until 12pm the next day, you will get the best results if you eat dinner by 5pm to 6pm and not eat until 9am or 10am so you still reap the metabolic benefits of consuming calories in the first half of the day.'\n\nThe Hollywood actresses are starring in the new TV drama The Morning Show, which will be screened on Apple TV+ next month.\n\nOut now: The interview can be read in this week's Radio Times\n\nThe series, for which they are also co-producers, is about rivalry and sexual harassment on a TV news programme.\n\nThe co-stars are keen to highlight how things have changed for actresses since the MeToo movement took off. However, despite starting on the hit series Friends in 1994, when she was just 25, Jennifer said she had not been a victim herself. She added: 'I have had a pretty easy time.'\n\nReese said: 'We are entering a time where female voices are important in Hollywood, because women see things in a different way.\n\n'Jen and I probably wouldn't have been able to make this show ten years ago. But people are taking us more seriously as creators and producers.'", "description": "Hollywood stars Jennifer Aniston, 50, and mother-of-three Reese Witherspoon, 43, stick to a regime of 16-hour fasts, daily green juices and gruelling workouts six days a week.", "authors": ["Alisha Rouse Showbusiness Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20025150-0-image-a-2_1571730161499.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
