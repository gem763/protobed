At a rally in Rio Rancho, the president declared that he has strong support from Latinos \u2014 because of his tough stance on migrants and drugs crossing the border. \u201cWe got a lot of Hispanics, got a lot of Hispanics,\u201d he later said. \u201cWe love our Hispanics.\u201d\n\nThis rally seemed to have a dual purpose: to show that Trump is reaching out to Hispanic voters and that he intends to put New Mexico in play for the 2020 election. But on both counts, the rally was an abject failure. There\u2019s no way that this president can win over a majority of Latinos or New Mexicans.\n\nConsider how Trump spoke about one of his top Latino supporters at the rally. Singling out Steve Cortes, a member of his Hispanic Advisory Council, the president said, \u201cHe happens to be Hispanic, but I\u2019ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do.\u201d This comment was staggeringly ignorant. Latinos come in all skin tones, and some may indeed fit the president\u2019s image of whatever a \u201cWASP\u201d looks like. So, what is there to figure out? Trump expressed the narrow sentiment that all Latinos should look one way, which shows how out of touch he is with the diversity of the nation\u2019s largest minority group.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen, shouting across the arena to Cortes, the president said, \u201cNobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\u201d Although Cortes\u2019 answer was inaudible, Trump\u2019s suggestion that he might have dual loyalties was at best bizarre and at worst offensive. It reflects the false, bigoted mindset that Latinos are less than fully American because we stay connected to our culture, language, and traditions. If this is how Trump speaks publicly about Cortes, imagine how he speaks privately about the many Latinos who are not his loyalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cortes said on Twitter that the president\u2019s phrasing was \u201cawkward,\u201d that Trump was \u201cjoking,\u201d and that \u201cCritics should stop imputing malice where there is none.\u201d Cortes\u2019 response was entirely predictable, as he has a history of defending virtually anything Trump does. That doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s record of anti-Hispanic bias go away. Remember when he was so impressed that a Border Patrol agent spoke \u201cperfect English?\u201d\n\nAt his rally, Trump went on to say that Latinos understand the drug crisis better than other voters. He said that Hispanics support his border wall because \u201cyou understand it better than other people, but at the center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people don\u2019t understand it.\u201d The president provided no context for Latinos\u2019 supposed understanding of the drug trade; this is simply more of Trump\u2019s natural inclination towards tired stereotypes. However, there is evidence that Hispanics do not support his border wall. A 2018 Pew survey found that 75 percent of Latinos are opposed to the idea.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s assertion at the rally that Hispanics love him, that\u2019s hardly true either. According to Pew, 79 percent of Hispanics disapprove of the job he is doing as president. A poll conducted by Latino Decisions this summer shows that only 21 percent of Hispanics support the president\u2019s re-election. Many Latinos have reported feeling targeted or fearful in the aftermath of the El Paso massacre, carried out by a shooter inspired by Trump\u2019s brand of anti-Hispanic rhetoric.\n\nPerhaps the only good thing that can be said about Trump\u2019s Monday rally is that the president may be attempting to reach beyond his base and bring in potential new supporters. If so, his move is motivated by political necessity. Trump\u2019s approval is declining in key battleground states that supported him in 2016, so he has to expand the map as a backup strategy for 2020.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nNot only is New Mexico 49 percent Hispanic, Trump\u2019s net approval in \u201cThe Land of Enchantment\u201d has gone down by 34 percentage points since he took office. The state has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 2004, when George W. Bush defeated John Kerry John Forbes KerryKerry urges China and India to step up on climate change in WaPo op-ed Sunday shows - Trump's Ukraine call, Iran dominate Kerry: 'One way or the other' Iran was responsible for Saudi attack MORE by less than 6,000 votes. The fact that Trump is diverting $125 million in funding for New Mexico military projects to pay for his wall is not going to help him in the state, either.\n\nUnderneath its spectacle, Trump\u2019s New Mexico rally only confirmed a sad, ugly truth. This president is unwilling to see Latinos \u2014 even his own supporters \u2014 as full Americans. And especially during Hispanic Heritage Month, that\u2019s nothing to celebrate.", "description": "\u201cNobody loves the Hispanics more.
