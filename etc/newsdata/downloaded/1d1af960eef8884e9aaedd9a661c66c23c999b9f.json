Chong is also the president of the Hong Kong Blind Union and Director of EL Education, an English Language learning service provider.\n\nThe group, which includes lawmakers Fernando Cheung and Ip Kin-yuen, added that the police\u2019s abuse of power and deployment of excessive force against young protesters had violated the Convention\u2019s Article 37, which states that \u201cEvery child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance\u201d, and that \u201cNo child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n\nThe group wrote an open letter to Carrie Lam.

This is totally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of a social worker, applying for a protection order is the last resort to protect a child, he added. \u201cThere are family and teens service centres, as well as children\u2019s homes available [for the arrested teenagers]. There\u2019s absolutely no need to detain them.\u201d\n\nHe also cited a case where the police justified their application of the order by their failure to reach the parents. However the parents involved claimed they did not hear from the police.\n\nAfter teen is shot by police during National Day clashes, anti-government demonstrators take to the streets\n\nThe group also criticised the police for multiple instances of not allowing young arrested protesters to be sent to police stations in the company and with the assistance of social workers.\n\nIn addition to sending their open letter to Lam, they are also collecting first-hand accounts of cases that allege the force\u2019s violation of human rights. They plan to file them in a report to be sent to relevant departments of the United Nations.", "description": "A children\u2019s rights concern group condemned the force for acting in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/scmp_hk_protest_human_chain_mid-levels.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
