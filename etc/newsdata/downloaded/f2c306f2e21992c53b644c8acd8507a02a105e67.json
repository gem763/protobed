But this recipe \u2014 a close-kept secret of Italian pasta maestra, Alessandra Spisni, and which comes to us via Evan Funke and Katie Parla\u2019s new cookbook American Sfoglino \u2014 pushes the dish to even dreamier heights. Loaded with creamy b\u00e9chamel and a red meat ragu, this lasagna uses a fresh spinach pasta dough* to really up the ante. Though, if you\u2019re strapped for time you could always sub in dried (or fresh) sheets from the store. See below to learn more about the origins of this mouth-watering dish, then scroll down for the full recipe.\n\nLasagne Verde Alla Bolognese\n\nBy Evan Funke with Katie Parla\n\nThere are as many lasagna recipes as there are cooks in Italy, yet, with so much variation, there is one regional tradition that stands out among all the others: Bologna\u2019s lasagna. It is the lasagna that all others aspire (and fail) to be. This particular incarnation of Italy\u2019s famous recipe features sheets of spinach pasta layered with meat rag\u00f9 and b\u00e9chamel. My version is straight out of Maestra Alessandra\u2019s playbook and it\u2019s a dish that graces her table \u2014 and mine \u2014 every time she invites an honoured guest for Sunday lunch.\n\nI feel particularly protective of this recipe and it really bonds me to the maestra. In all the time Alessandra has had La Vecchia Scuola, she never let any student build her lasagna. The dish is so sacred to her that even her daughter wasn\u2019t allowed to touch it. One day, about three months into my tenure there, she nonchalantly asked me to roll out a sfoglia verde, then brought rag\u00f9, b\u00e9chamel, and a pan over to my counter and said, \u201cfai\u201d \u2014 make it. It was one of the proudest days of my professional life.\n\nMaking lasagna requires several components, so be sure each is ready before you start the assembly. You\u2019ll need a pot at least 16 inches wide for blanching the pasta sheets. You can also halve the sheets crosswise and use a smaller pot at least 8 inches wide.\n\nIngredients\n\nUnsalted butter, for greasing\n\n1 recipe Sfoglia Verde Agli Spinaci* (see link to recipe above), at room temperature\n\n\u201c00\u201d flour, for dusting\n\nKosher salt\n\n\u00bd recipe Rag\u00f9 Della Vecchia Scuola (see below)\n\n1 recipe Besciamella (see below)\n\n6 cups finely grated parmigiano-reggiano, plus more for sprinkling\n\nBesciamella:\n\n8 tbsp unsalted butter\n\n1 cup \u201c00\u201d flour\n\n1 qt whole milk\n\n1 tsp kosher salt\n\n5 small pinches of ground nutmeg, preferably freshly grated\n\nRag\u00f9 Della Vecchia Scuola:\n\n2 \u00bc lb beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes\n\n\u00bd lb pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes\n\n5 oz pancetta, cut into 1-inch cubes\n\n5 oz prosciutto di parma, cut into 1-inch cubes\n\n5 oz mortadella, cut into 1-inch cubes\n\n4 celery stalks, roughly chopped\n\n1 carrot, roughly chopped\n\n1 large yellow onion, roughly chopped\n\n5 oz strutto\n\nKosher salt\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\n1 \u00bd cups dry, fruity red wine (I like Sangiovese)\n\n2 cups passata di pomodoro\n\n2 cups brodo di carne, or low-sodium chicken broth\n\n2 tbsp unsalted butter\n\nPreparation\n\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Lightly grease a 15 x 9.5-inch baking dish with unsalted butter.\n\nRoll one dough ball to a thickness of 9 Post-it\u00ae Notes on a lightly floured surface. Using a sharp knife, cut the sfoglia into 3 pieces measuring about 16 x 8 inches. Lightly flour another surface and set the pieces on it to dry, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, flipping midway through the drying time. Reserve the scraps, which you may need to fill in any gaps when assembling the lasagna.\n\nMeanwhile, repeat the process with the remaining dough ball.\n\nLine two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Season the water with salt. When the salt dissolves, add 1 pasta sheet and blanch for 30 seconds. Using a spider, transfer the pasta to the prepared baking sheet to cool. Once the pasta is cool enough to handle, smooth it out. Repeat with the remaining 5 pasta sheets.\n\nSpread about 1 cup of rag\u00f9 in the prepared baking dish, distributing it evenly. Spread \u00bd cup of the besciamella over the rag\u00f9, distributing it evenly. Place one blanched pasta sheet over the sauce and besciamella layer. Spread about 1 cup of rag\u00f9 over the blanched pasta, distributing it evenly, followed by \u00bd cup of the besciamella, distributing it evenly. Dust with about 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Continue to layer the pasta with the remaining rag\u00f9, besciamella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano, ending with the Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n\nCover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the pasta is cooked through and the edges are crispy and browned, about 30 minutes more. Let the lasagna rest for 10 to 15 minutes to firm up before serving. Serve immediately with more Parmigiano-Reggiano on the side.\n\nThe cooked lasagna will keep, refrigerated and tightly covered, for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\n\nBesciamella:\n\nIn a medium saut\u00e9 pan or skillet over medium heat, melt the butter until frothy and golden. Whisking vigorously, slowly \u201crain in\u201d the flour. Once all the flour is added, whisk continuously for 3 minutes more. The mixture should appear crumbly, but smell sweet and toasted.\n\nStill whisking continuously, add the milk in a steady stream, whisking until the mixture is very smooth. Season with the salt and nutmeg and whisk to combine. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the mixture until it is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 2 \u00bd minutes. Use now or refrigerate.\n\nThe b\u00e9chamel will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container with plastic wrap laid over the surface, for up to 5 days. To reheat, transfer to a medium saut\u00e9 pan or skillet and add warm water, as needed, whisking constantly to avoid clumping as the b\u00e9chamel warms.\n\nRag\u00f9 Della Vecchia Scuola:\n\nUsing a meat grinder, or a grinder attachment, fitted with a large die, grind the beef into a large bowl. Without cleaning the grinder, grind the pork shoulder into the same bowl. Set aside. Without cleaning the grinder, grind the pancetta, prosciutto, and mortadella twice into a medium bowl. Set aside. Pass the celery, carrots, and onions through the grinder into another large bowl and set aside.\n\nIn a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, melt the strutto. Add the ground prosciutto and pancetta and cook until the fat has rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the ground vegetables. Cook, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown and softened, about 15 minutes.\n\nAdd the ground beef and pork and generously season with salt and a small amount of pepper. Using a wooden spoon, gently mix the meat and vegetables, stirring from the bottom of the pot. Cook until the meat releases its juices, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook until the contents of the pan begin to steam. Add the passata and brodo, stir to combine, and turn the heat to low.\n\nCook the sauce at a bare simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the sauce is concentrated, 5 to 7 hours. Begin tasting for tenderness and seasoning after 5 hours. (If you\u2019re using grass-fed beef, it will take a lot more time to cook than conventionally raised beef.)\n\nTransfer 6 cups of the sauce to a large pot. (Store the extra sauce according to the instructions following.) Place the pan over medium heat. Bring the sauce to a rapid simmer and cook until the sauce reduces slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the butter and swirl to emulsify. Set the sauce aside.\n\nThe sauce will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for up to 5 days, or frozen for up to 6 months.\n\nYield: Makes one 15 x 9.5-inch lasagna, serving 6\n\nExcerpted from American Sfoglino.
