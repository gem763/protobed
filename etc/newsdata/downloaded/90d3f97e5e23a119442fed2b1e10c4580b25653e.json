The leader is pictured at the National Day parade on October 1\n\n'Therefore, DF-41 should normally carry three to four W88 warheads with a yield of around 500 kilotons or one single warhead with a yield of one million ton,' he claimed.\n\nHe added: 'One DF-41 could hit and destroy mega cities such as New York without a problem.'\n\nThe author then showed an image demonstrating how four warheads could hit the US eastern coast, destroying the Big Apple.\n\nThe mighty weapon, which took 10 years to develop, is 'the pillar of Beijing's strategic nuclear power', said state broadcaster CCTV.
