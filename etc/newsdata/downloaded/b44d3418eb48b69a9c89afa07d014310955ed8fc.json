But a new scientific analysis of the American artist's works may let experts to confirm which are real \u2014 and which are simply 'Pollocks'\n\nThe team found that Pollock's technique seems to intentionally avoid what is known as 'coiling instability' \u2014 the tendency of a viscous fluid to form curls and coils when poured onto a surface.\n\n'Like most painters, Jackson Pollock went through a long process of experimentation in order to perfect his technique,' said paper author and engineer Roberto Zenit of the Brown University in Rhode Island.\n\n'What we were trying to do with this research is figure out what conclusions Pollock reached in order to execute his paintings the way he wanted.'\n\n'Our main finding in this paper was that Pollock's movements and the properties of his paints were such [that] he avoided this coiling instability.'\n\nAccording to Professor Zenit, Pollock's technique typically involved pouring paint straight from a can or along a stick onto a canvas lying horizontally on the floor \u2014 an artistic approach often referred to as the 'drip technique'.\n\nHowever, he explained, this a bit of a 'misnomer' in the parlance of fluid mechanics, in which 'dripping' means dispensing the fluid in a way that it makes discrete drops.\n\nPollock largely avoided droplets in favour of unbroken filaments of paint that stretched across his canvas.\n\nTo understand exactly how the technique worked, Professor Zenit and colleagues analysed extensive videos of Pollock at work, taking careful measures of how fast he moved and how far from the canvas he poured his paints.\n\nThe research team then replicated his technique in the laboratory.\n\nUsing the set-up, the team deposited paint using a syringe \u2014 mounted at varying heights above a canvas \u2014 which they moved at different speeds.\n\nPollock created his most iconic works not with a brush, but by pouring paint onto canvas from above, weaving filaments of colour into abstract masterpieces\n\nThe experiments helped the team to zero in on the most important aspects of what Pollock was doing.\n\n'We can vary one thing at a time so we can decipher the key elements of the technique,' Professor Zenit explained.\n\n'For example, we could vary the height from which the paint is poured and keep the speed constant to see how that changes things.'\n\nThe team found that the combination of Pollock's hand speed, the distance he maintained from the canvas and the viscosity of his paint all seem to be aimed at avoiding coiling instability.\n\nAnyone who's ever poured a viscous fluid \u2014 such as honey onto toast \u2014 has likely seen some coiling instability, Professor Zenit noted.\n\nWhen a small amount of a viscous fluid is poured, it tends to stack up like a coil of rope, before eventually oozing across the target surface.\n\nStudy senior author Professor Roberto Zenit, of Brown University in the United States, said: 'Like most painters, Jackson Pollock went through a long process of experimentation in order to perfect his technique'\n\nIn the context of Pollock's technique, Professor Zenit explained that the instability can result in paint filaments making pigtail-like curls when poured from the can.\n\nPrevious research had concluded that that the curved lines in Pollock's paintings were a result of this instability \u2014 but the new study shows the opposite.\n\n'What we found is that he moved his hand at a sufficiently high speed and a sufficiently short height such that this coiling would not occur,' Professor Zenit said.\n\nHe says the findings could be 'useful' in authenticating Pollock's works, with too many tight curls suggesting that a drip-style painting is not a Pollock.\n\nThe findings could also inform other settings in which viscous fluids are stretched into filaments \u2014 such as the manufacture of fibre optics.\n\nYet Professor Zenit said that his main interest in the work is that it is simply a 'fascinating' way to explore interesting questions in fluid mechanics.\n\n'I consider myself to be a fluid mechanics messenger,' he said.\n\n'This is my excuse to talk science. It's fascinating to see that painters are really fluid mechanicians, even though they may not know it.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS One.", "description": "Experts analysing the physics of the American Painter's technique have shown that the artist had a 'keen understanding', if unconscious, of a classic phenomenon in fluid dynamics.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/17/20389458-0-image-a-97_1572457779088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
