If so, it would tremendously improve the lives of the local population,\" he added.\n\nOn Saturday, a possible thawing of frosty relations between the two neighbors came about after Russia and Ukraine exchanged a total of 70 prisoners, including Ukrainian sailors that were detained in November 2018 following a skirmish in the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe incident in the strait was just one of a number of incidents reflecting heightened tensions between the countries since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in a pro-Russian uprising in the Donbass region in the east of the country.\n\nThe uprising prompted Russian-backed separatists within the Donbass to proclaim two \"people's republics\" in Donetsk and Luhansk, exacerbating the destabilization of (and tensions with) Ukraine. It has also led to Russia becoming something of a pariah in the international community and it is still subject to sanctions for its actions.", "description": "A high-profile prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine is being seen as a boost to the possible resumption of peace talks, but some experts are tempering those hopes.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106123694-1568200976191gettyimages-981438934.jpeg?v=1568201005", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
