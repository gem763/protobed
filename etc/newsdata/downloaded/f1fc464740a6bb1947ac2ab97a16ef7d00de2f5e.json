They live mostly in the north of the country, close to the border with Turkey, alongside Arabs and other ethnic groups. There are also large Kurdish populations in Turkey, Iraq and Iran, but there is no country with a Kurdish majority.\n\nHow did Syrian Kurds become involved in the war?\n\nAs peaceful demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad descended into an armed civil war in 2011 and 2012, various factions vied for control of Syria. These included pro-government militias, rebels fighting for a more democratic state, Islamist extremists, and militias from ethnic and religious minorities seeking to protect their areas from attack.\n\nAmong them were several Kurdish militias, the strongest of which was the People\u2019s Protection Units, known by its Kurdish initials, the Y.P.G.\n\nHow did America become involved in the war?\n\nFor several years, the Obama administration resisted calls to play a direct role in the Syrian war, preferring instead to provide funding and training for some rebel groups.\n\nBut President Barack Obama changed his mind as the Islamic State took advantage of the chaos of the war to capture vast swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory.", "description": "Why did Turkey invade?
