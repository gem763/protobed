Trump highlights Powell's pinch.", "language": "en", "text": "THE TICKER\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nPresident Trump, amid angrily tweeting about the House Democratic impeachment inquiry, unintentionally summarized the conundrum facing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nIn three tweets, Trump piled on political pressure to keep cutting interest rates further -- even as he touted the strength of the U.S. economy, accurately noting the S&P 500 is flirting with record highs and the housing market looks resilient (though he also claimed slipping consumer confidence is \u201cvery good\").\n\nThe S&P just hit an ALL TIME HIGH. This is a big win for jobs, 401-K\u2019s, and, frankly, EVERYONE! Our Country is doing great. Even killed long sought ISIS murderer, Al-Baghdadi. We are stronger than ever before, with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019\n\nConsumer Confidence number very good. Housing sales in September up nicely. Economy Rocks! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\n\u201cOver in Europe and Japan they have NEGATIVE RATES. They get paid to borrow money. Don\u2019t we have to follow our competitors?\u201d @Varneyco Yes we do. The Fed doesn\u2019t have a clue! We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve. But we are winning anyway! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nThe Fed is highly likely to follow suit today. Bond traders are pricing in a 97.3 percent probability the central bank trims its benchmark interest rate by another quarter-point, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, and the consensus among Fed-watching economists reflects that view.\n\nWhat happens next is a much trickier question for Powell. As he seeks to plot a course beyond this week\u2019s meeting, he must weigh signs of economic resilience against the possibility conditions deteriorate.\n\n\u201cWall Street investors do not expect another reduction this year, and views are split on what the central bank will do in 2020,\u201d my colleague Heather Long writes. \u201cPowell has tried to keep the Fed out of the political fray, and he and his colleagues are aware that stimulating the economy next year \u2014 or not \u2014 could influence the election.\u201d\n\nAs Heather writes, Fed officials have gotten an earful on their nationwide \u201cFed Listens\u201d tour from workers urging more rate cuts. And other economic signals are flashing warning signs: Manufacturing is contracting; job gains have slowed; economists are lowering their projections for GDP growth and raising concerns about a recession next year.\n\nYet there are also reasons for optimism. A pause in U.S.-China trade hostilities may be at hand. And beyond the measures of economic health Trump cited, the bond market suggests a pause is in order. \u201cTwo-year yields, at 1.64%, are up almost 30 basis points from earlier this month, while 10-year yields have climbed more than 40 basis points from their lows,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Brian Chappata notes. \u201cThe yield curve between those two maturities is the most positively sloped since before the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in July \u2014 a far cry from August\u2019s \u2018doom and gloom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe pressure will be on Powell today as he faces reporters \u2014 with investors on Wall Street and beyond hanging on his every word \u2014 to preserve maximum maneuverability when he is asked to detail the Fed\u2019s path forward. \u201cMr. Powell\u2019s task will be to craft a message that neither presumes a cut is likely in December nor declares an outright end to rate cuts \u2014 without provoking a market backlash that unwinds the benefits from moves to reduce borrowing costs for households and businesses,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos writes. Or, as Morgan Stanley chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner tells him, \u201cThe challenge is threading a needle where the eye has become extremely tiny.\u201d\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson writes in a note to clients his firm expects Powell \u201cto make it clear that a presumption that the data will trigger more rate cuts is dangerous\u2026 We think any attempt by Chair Powell today to persuade his colleagues to signal an intention to keep cutting rates would be met with real resistance, and we doubt that Mr. Powell feels the need to pick that fight at this point.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

CNBC's Fred Imbert: \"The S&P 500 touched a fresh record high on Tuesday before closing just below the flatline as investors looked ahead to key Federal Reserve meeting. The broad index closed 0.1% lower at 3,036.89, snapping a four-day winning streak. Earlier in the session, however, it gained as much as 0.3% to hit an all-time high of 3,047.87... Tuesday\u2019s moves come a day after the S&P 500 posted its first record high since July 26, breaking above 3,027.98. Better-than-expected earnings, along with improvements on the U.S.-China trade front, pushed the broad index above its previous record set in July.\"\n\n\u2014 U.K. aims for Brexit clarity with December election. The Post's Karla Adam and William Booth: \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday finally won lawmakers\u2019 support for an early election, setting up a Dec. 12 ballot that will be dominated by Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit.Parliament will dissolve next week, and the parties will go into overdrive on their five-week campaigns... Voters will be offered some stark choices on Brexit, alongside the usual overenthusiastic promises, scary scenarios, misrepresentations and foggy numbers. Will the British double down on wanting to leave the European Union? Or will they change their minds and decide to stay in the largest trading club on the planet?\"\n\n\u2014 Mnuchin open to looser bank rules. Bloomberg's Saleha Mohsin: \"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is open to loosening financial crisis-era regulations that have stiffened liquidity rules for big banks to relieve possible cash crunches in short-term funding markets. Mnuchin said in an interview Tuesday that he had spoken to Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and other banks about how to avoid liquidity problems. 'The banks have raised an issue around intra-day liquidity, and that is something that makes sense for regulators to look at,' Mnuchin said in Tel Aviv, his first stop during an 11-day trip through the Middle East and India.\"\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nPresident Trump holds a letter presented to him by Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE)\n\n\u2014 The U.S.-China might not be ready soon after all: \u201cAn interim trade agreement between the United States and China might not be completed in time for signing in Chile next month as expected but that does not mean the accord is falling apart, a U.S. administration official said,\u201d Reuters\u2019s Steve Holland reports.\n\n\u201c \u2018If it\u2019s not signed in Chile, that doesn\u2019t mean that it falls apart. It just means that it\u2019s not ready,\u2019 the administration official said. \u2018Our goal is to sign it in Chile. But sometimes texts aren\u2019t ready. But good progress is being made and we expect to sign the agreement in Chile.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAg purchases are a sticking point. Reuters's Heather Timmons and Hallie Gu: \"Trump has said publicly that China could buy as much as $50 billion of U.S. farm products, more than double the annual amount it did the year before the trade war started. U.S. officials continue to push for that in talks, while Beijing is balking at committing to a large figure and a specific time frame. Chinese buyers would like the discretion to buy based on market conditions.\"\n\n\u2014 Tariff Man\u2019s efforts to save steel backfired: \u201cWhen [Trump] slapped 25% tariffs on foreign steel in March 2018, panicky U.S. buyers rushed to place new orders ahead of feared supply interruptions, driving prices up sharply,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Don Lee reports.\n\n\u201cIt was an instant bonanza for domestic steel producers. With much fanfare, some announced ambitious expansion plans. United States Steel Corp. even fired up a pair of long-idled blast furnaces in Granite City, Ill., and Trump seized the occasion to deliver a rousing speech at the plant about the industry\u2019s resurgence. What a difference a year has made. Benchmark steel prices have fallen well below their level before the tariffs took effect and are now about half their peak in July 2018. The industry has responded with production cutbacks.\u201d\n\nWhat happened: \u201cEmboldened by tariffs, the president\u2019s pro-business rhetoric and tax cuts that poured money into corporate coffers, steel companies went on a spending spree that added production capacity to a domestic market that didn\u2019t need it. Historically low interest rates added to the steel industry\u2019s enthusiasm for investing in new and improved plants and equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmboldened by tariffs, the president\u2019s pro-business rhetoric and tax cuts that poured money into corporate coffers, steel companies went on a spending spree that added production capacity to a domestic market that didn\u2019t need it. Historically low interest rates added to the steel industry\u2019s enthusiasm for investing in new and improved plants and equipment.\u201d And other tariffs didn\u2019t help: \u201cAt the same time, Trump\u2019s penchant for on-again, off-again trade warfare contributed to a general slowdown of the global economy. U.S. manufacturing, which along with the construction sector is the principal consumer of American steel, is currently in recession.\u201d\n\nThe picture of Midwest manufacturing isn\u2019t any rosier: \u201cThe sudden slump at this 110-year-old company illustrates the economic erosion that is challenging [Trump\u2019s] signature promise to restore a lost era of American manufacturing greatness,\u201d my colleague David J. Lynch reports of the Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry.\n\n\u201cEven as the $21 trillion U.S. economy continues growing, and unemployment hovers at a half-century low, factory activity has contracted for two consecutive months, according to the closely watched Institute for Supply Management index. Many consumer-goods makers are still humming. But manufacturers that serve global markets are being buffeted by trade wars and profound uncertainty over the future.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The White House wants control over where cars are made: \u201cThe Trump administration wants to dictate how and where global auto companies make cars and parts to secure duty-free treatment under the new NAFTA \u2014 in its most direct intervention yet to manage trade and production, according to people familiar with the effort,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Jenny Leonard reports.\n\n\u201cThe issue is being discussed between Trump administration officials, congressional staff, and domestic and foreign auto makers in the context of the legislation that lawmakers will vote on for the trade deal to take effect. The White House wants specific language that would allow it to unilaterally administer the production rules for companies \u2026 But the companies, lawmakers and even the U.S. International Trade Commission in an economic analysis have cautioned that the rules are so strict that they would result in higher car prices and lost sales.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Labor secretary approved to participate in Fiduciary rule discussion: \u201cLabor Secretary Eugene Scalia can participate in the department\u2019s rewrite of a closely watched investment-advice rule, career government ethics attorneys said,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Eric Morath reports.\n\n\u201cMr. Scalia, a former Washington lawyer, assumed the cabinet position a month ago and whether he could participate in the Labor Department\u2019s rulemaking on financial advice was an open question. He had previously handled a legal challenge to the Obama administration\u2019s version of the regulation, known as the fiduciary rule.\u201d\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nRobert Murray, right, chief executive and founder of Murray Energy, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry at a March meeting. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Murray Energy files for bankruptcy: \u201cMurray Energy Corp., the private coal giant whose founder pushed the Trump administration for an overhaul of what it called \u2018anti-coal\u2019 environmental policy, filed for Chapter 11 protection,\u201d my colleagues Taylor Telford and Dino Grandoni report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fifth coal company to land in bankruptcy court this year, in a rapidly shrinking industry that\u2019s being squeezed out of the U.S. power market by cheaper options such as natural gas, solar and wind power. The long-anticipated bankruptcy is another sign that [Trump\u2019s] efforts to save the sputtering coal industry, a central promise of his 2016 campaign, have largely failed.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Juul names new CFO: \u201cJuul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite has replaced the company\u2019s chief financial officer amid a management shake-up at the embattled e-cigarette maker, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Angelica LaVito reports.\n\n\u201cSeveral top executives have left the company, including Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould and Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher, two veteran employees at the young start-up. Newcomers Craig Brommers, chief marketing officer, and David Foster, senior vice president of advanced technologies, are also gone.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Strikes cost GM nearly $3 billion: \u201cGeneral Motors Co. lowered its full-year profit outlook, saying the 40-day strike at its U.S. factories wiped out nearly all its free cash flow for the year and will cost the Detroit auto maker close to $3 billion in lost earnings,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Mike Colias reports.\n\n\u201cThe move came even as the car company posted third-quarter results that easily surpassed analysts\u2019 forecasts. GM shares rose 4.3% ... a sign that investors are looking past the strike to the potential for strong earnings in 2020 underpinned by a refreshed line of pickup trucks, the company\u2019s biggest moneymakers. The share-price gains made up nearly all the ground the stock had lost since the strike began in mid-September.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, GM sides with Trump in California fight: \u201cBreaking with some of their biggest rivals, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota said \u2026 they were intervening on the side of the Trump administration in an escalating battle with California over fuel economy standards for automobiles,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Hiroko Tabuchi reports. \u201cTheir decision pits them against leading competitors, including Honda and Ford, who this year reached a deal to follow California\u2019s stricter rules. It represents the latest twist in one of the Trump administration\u2019s most consequential rollbacks of regulations designed to fight climate change.\u201d\n\nFiat, Peugeot in possible merger talks: \u201cFiat Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot maker PSA Group of France are in talks over a potential combination, according to people familiar with the matter. A deal could create a nearly $50 billion trans-Atlantic auto giant,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Ben Dummett, Nick Kostov and Christina Rogers report.\n\n\u2014 NCAA makes major shift: \u201cAmid rising pressure from lawmakers to permit college athletes to profit from their fame, the NCAA announced it would consider rules changes that would allow college athletes \u2018the opportunity to benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness in a manner consistent with the collegiate model,\u2019 \u201d my colleague Will Hobson reports.\n\n\u201cThe statement and an accompanying NCAA \u2018questions and answers\u2019 explanation represented the organization\u2019s first acknowledgment of a willingness to discuss permitting individual athletes to trade on their fame. However, it contained few specifics on how doing so could be reconciled with \u2018the collegiate model\u2019 that prohibits such benefits and likely won\u2019t quell the organization\u2019s critics or pacify elected officials pushing for change.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Saudi Aramaco IPO set to begin next week: \u201cSaudi Aramco aims to announce the start of its initial public offering (IPO) on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, after delaying the deal earlier this month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors,\u201d Reuters\u2019s Hadeel Al Sayegh, Davide Barbuscia and Saeed Azhar report.\n\n\u2014 Futures exchanges cut down on runaway algorithms: \u201cThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange is cracking down on runaway algorithms in one of the world\u2019s biggest futures market,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Alexander Osipovich reports.\n\n\u201cOver the past two months, the volume of data generated by activity in CME\u2019s Eurodollar futures soared 10-fold, according to exchange statistics. The torrent of data strained trading systems and prompted complaints to the exchange, traders said. It subsided Monday after CME took emergency measures to halt it \u2026 The data surge, which hasn\u2019t been previously reported, wasn\u2019t caused by an actual increase in trading. Instead, it mainly consisted of digital messages that showed changes to quotes to buy or sell Eurodollar futures, a contract that tracks short-term U.S. interest rates.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Subprime lenders are back with a new type of credit: \u201cIt\u2019s called the online installment loan, a form of debt with much longer maturities but often the same sort of crippling, triple-digit interest rates,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Christopher Maloney and Adam Tempkin report.\n\n\u201cIf the payday loan\u2019s target audience is the nation\u2019s poor, then the installment loan is geared to all those working-class Americans who have seen their wages stagnate and unpaid bills pile up in the years since the Great Recession \u2026 In just a span of five years, online installment loans have gone from being a relatively niche offering to a red-hot industry. Non-prime borrowers now collectively owe about $50 billion on installment products, according to credit reporting firm TransUnion.\u201d\n\nMONEY ON THE HILL\n\nJohn Hamilton, vice president and chief engineer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, and Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg look back at family members holding photographs of Boeing 737 Max crash victims.
