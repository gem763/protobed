So when crews started digging up the floor to make the building more accessible, archaeologists were curious to know what they might find.\n\nBut they didn't expect to unearth skeletal remains.\n\n\"It was very exciting,\" Alfred Hawkins, assistant curator of historic buildings at the Historic Royal Palaces, told As It Happens guest host Helen Mann.\n\n\"We found a Medieval floor surface and within that were two burial cuts, containing complete human skeletons.\"\n\nHawkins was on site during the excavation, which took place last spring at the tower's Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula.\n\n\"I got to see it all unfold,\" Hawkins said. \"The fact that we were also able to perform scientific analysis on the bones was something really amazing.\"\n\nHawkins says the bones could 'completely change our understanding of the evolution of the buildings on the site.' (Historic Royal Palaces)\n\nThat analysis suggests the two sets of bones likely belonged to a woman between the ages of 35 and 45 and a child around the age of seven.\n\nWhether the pair were related is still unknown, but Hawkins says looking at the pathology of the bones has provided other clues to who these two people may have been.\n\n\"From the bones, you can see that they weren't particularly malnourished, but they weren't well-feed either. So we get a vague idea of their social status from that,\" Hawkins said.\n\n\"These little bits of evidence lead us to think that they are fairly normal people living between 1450 and 1550.\"\n\nHawkins says the Tower of London operated like a small town within London and that the skeletons could belong to people who worked within its walls.

(Daniel Sorabji/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOne theory Hawkins puts forward is that the two bodies are people who worked in the Tower of London complex.\n\n\"You have to remember that this place has always been a mini-town within London,\" Hawkins said.\n\n\"[There's] various little national institutions which were born here and all of the people who worked at those institutions lived within the walls of the tower. So when they died as well, they were buried in this chapel, alongside those people who were so remarkable and who we remember today.\"\n\nIn addition to the bones, Hawkins says the discovery of the Medieval floor, tiles and pottery is also significant. It suggests the former building on that site may have been Edward I's chapel \u2014 which, until now, was believed to be built at a different location.\n\n\"It's kind of completely unravelled where we think the previous building on the site was, which is really, really exciting,\" Hawkins said. \"It was a fairly find-heavy dig.\"\n\nThe research will continue, he said, but the two skeletons have already been reinterred at the chapel.\n\n\"It was a really special kind of ceremony,\" Hawkins said.\n\n\"The key with this is always trying to maintain the respect and dignity of a Christian burial for these individuals. So it was really nice to be part of that.\"\n\nWritten by John McGill.
