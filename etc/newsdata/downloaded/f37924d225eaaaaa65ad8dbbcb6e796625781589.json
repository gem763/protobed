No data centers are under construction. Amazon officials say there has been no movement on a deal this year. And when executives from dozens of major U.S. companies stream into Riyadh on Tuesday for an investment conference marking Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s return to the world stage, neither Amazon founder Jeff Bezos nor any of his top executives will be there, according to an Amazon official familiar with the company\u2019s plans.\n\nAlthough no one on either side is willing to declare the ties between Amazon and the Saudis permanently severed, the freeze in what had been a promising relationship came about following a rapid-fire sequence of chilling events: After Khashoggi\u2019s killing in Istanbul, the planet\u2019s richest man, who also owns The Post, became the target of waves of criticism from Saudi-based online trolls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd after the National Enquirer published an expos\u00e9 earlier this year detailing Bezos\u2019s extramarital affair, the billionaire revealed that the Enquirer had threatened to publish explicit photos of him unless he publicly stated that there had been no political motivation for the tabloid\u2019s story. Bezos would make no such concession; his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, alleged that the Saudi government had \u201caccess to Bezos\u2019s phone and gained private information.\u201d De Becker said the \u201cSaudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since . . . The Post began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\nIn the months since, no evidence has emerged to bolster the theory that the Saudis used information hacked from Bezos\u2019s phone in a campaign against the billionaire, possibly including the photos that the Enquirer threatened to publish. The Enquirer denied any Saudi role in their reporting on the affair. Federal prosecutors in New York who were looking into the allegations of Saudi involvement have issued no charges.\n\nA year after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the roots of the friction between the Saudis and Bezos remain disputed. Some business leaders and Saudi insiders say Saudi antagonism toward Bezos stems from the billionaire\u2019s decision to join others in spurning the crown prince\u2019s international business showcase, informally known as Davos in the Desert, both last year and again this month. Others say the Saudis went on the offensive against Bezos because they believed, incorrectly, that he directed The Post\u2019s coverage of the Khashoggi murder.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAround the time the Enquirer published its story, Bezos was hit with another, apparently coordinated wave of Twitter attacks launched from Saudi Arabia \u2014 a tactic that Khashoggi had long highlighted in his reporting on what he saw as his homeland\u2019s corrupt regime. Shortly before his murder, the columnist was helping to fund a pro-democracy foundation that would support Saudi dissidents and counter social media trolls who parroted the government\u2019s views.\n\nIn a blog post earlier this year, Bezos, who declined to comment for this article, called his ownership of The Post \u201ca complexifier for me.\u201d He said that \u201ccertain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy.\u201d\n\nRacing to expand\n\nBezos\u2019s cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services, has grown into the most profitable part of his colossal company, earning more than Amazon reaped from online sales, its television production unit, its Kindles or Alexa virtual assistants in North America combined. AWS did $25.7 billion in business in 2018 \u2014 more than McDonald\u2019s \u2014 an astounding 47 percent growth from the previous year. Analysts expected much of AWS\u2019s growth to come from abroad. With customers in 172 countries and staff in 35 nations, AWS was growing so fast internationally that it hired at the same pace abroad as it did in the United States last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are just scratching the surface,\u201d AWS chief Andy Jassy said recently at a conference.\n\nWith its two top competitors \u2014 Microsoft and Google \u2014 racing to catch up, AWS targeted the Middle East and specifically Saudi Arabia as part of its next round of expansion. The three companies scour the globe for places to build data centers that can provide on-demand computing services for giant corporations, tiny start-ups and governmental bodies of all types and sizes.\n\nThese cloud-computing giants need access to reliable power, electrical infrastructure, affordable land and a growing crop of corporate customers. Saudi Arabia matched all of these criteria. Not only is Saudi Arabia one of the wealthiest nations in the Middle East, but its diversifying economy and the fact that nearly 60 percent of its people are under 30 offer an opportunity for dramatic growth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEight months into the Trump administration, AWS announced plans to open its first Middle East data center in Bahrain and host its first regional summit there. In the following months, reports emerged in financial media around the world that Saudi Arabia was poised to be next or that Saudi Arabia might even beat its neighbor to the punch.\n\nThe reports said Amazon was on the verge of finalizing a $1 billion deal to build three data centers in Saudi Arabia; the deal was likely to be announced during the crown prince\u2019s visit to the United States in early 2018.\n\nRelations between Saudi Arabia and the United States seemed to be growing closer. The new American president picked it for his first foreign trip. The Saudi prince called Trump \u201ca president who will bring America back to the right track.\u201d Later in 2017, when reports surfaced that Mohammed \u2014 often referred to as MBS \u2014 and his uncle, King Salman, had jailed hundreds of political rivals and business executives, Trump tweeted his support: \u201cI have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe prince ingratiated himself in particular with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. And Mohammed began rolling back some of the religious extremism that limited his country\u2019s participation in the global economy.\n\nWhen the kingdom announced that in May 2017 that it would allow women to work and study without their husbands\u2019 or fathers\u2019 permission, AWS\u2019s top government sales executive, Teresa Carlson, applauded, tweeting the news with the hashtags #progress and #keeppushinghard.\n\nA Kentucky native who trumpets her love for college sports, horse racing and bourbon from her home state, Carlson personally woos foreign leaders to team up with AWS on its cloud expansion. Two people who have worked with her at Amazon, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the negotiations, said Carlson aggressively pushed for a data center deal in Saudi Arabia starting soon after she joined the company in 2010. AWS declined to make Carlson available for an interview or to answer questions about her role in talks with Saudi Arabia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmazon emphasized its interest in the region by purchasing Dubai-based Souq.com, an e-commerce site that has since been rebranded as Amazon.com/ae, to reach online retail markets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. At $580 million, it was Amazon\u2019s priciest foreign acquisition ever \u2014 a sign of how critical the region was to the company.\n\nSaudi Arabia was already one of the top cloud-computing spenders in all of the Middle East and Africa. Of the six nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council, \u201cthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most logical place for a data center presence,\u201d said Tiny Haynes, a senior analyst at the research firm Gartner.\n\nSaudi Arabia had its own ambitions. \u201cWithin 20 years, we will be an economy or state that doesn\u2019t depend mainly on oil,\u201d Mohammed said in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nThe Saudis aimed to move part of their enormous oil assets into more diverse holdings by deepening ties to the West, investing especially in U.S. tech firms.\n\nAD\n\nAs Mohammed prepared to visit the United States last year, news reports in several countries said his agenda included a final push to seal the deal with Amazon to build the data centers. Some analysts and Amazon insiders concluded that a deal was imminent when Bezos agreed to meet with the crown prince during his visit in March of last year.\n\n\u201cHe would not meet with somebody unless he got direction that it was a huge opportunity,\u201d said one of the people who worked with Carlson at Amazon. \u201cHe is famous for turning down meetings from heads of state. He does not do the polite shake of hand. They had to be close to finalizing something.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA complex relationship\n\nSeven months after the prince\u2019s visit to America, Khashoggi was dead. There was no official cancellation of the data-centers deal, but no movement toward construction either.\n\nAD\n\nAn official familiar with Amazon\u2019s plans said \u201cthere are no new developments\u201d in the long-standing effort to build AWS facilities in Saudi Arabia. And an Amazon official said that neither Bezos nor any other senior Amazon or AWS executives will attend the Future Investment Initiative, the crown prince\u2019s economic conference, which begins Tuesday.\n\nAn official close to Bezos who is familiar with his thinking said Bezos stands by the allegations about the Enquirer and the Saudis. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on its investigation into ties between the Saudis and the Enquirer.\n\nAccording to people familiar with Bezos\u2019s thinking, one \u201ccomplexifier\u201d in Bezos\u2019s relationship with the Saudi government was the contract that The Post entered into with Khashoggi, who had fled to the United States to seek political asylum. His first column was headlined, \u201cSaudi Arabia wasn\u2019t always this oppressive. Now it\u2019s unbearable.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Bezos had begun an extramarital affair with Lauren Sanchez, a pilot and former TV host.\n\nLess than two weeks after Khashoggi was killed, a wave of anti-Bezos tweets originating in Saudi Arabia appeared, bashing Amazon and The Post in Arabic.\n\nSome of the tweets attacked Bezos as a \u201cJew,\u201d even though he is not Jewish. \u201cWe as Saudis will never accept that The Washington Post attacks us during the day, only to buy products from Amazon and Souq.com by night!\u201d said one of many such attacks. \u201cStrange that all three companies are owned by the same Jew who attacks us by day, and sells us products by night!\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s relationship with Twitter and other social media had begun in earnest with the Arab Spring in 2011, when young pro-democracy demonstrators shook authoritarian regimes from Tunisia to Bahrain. In Saudi Arabia, however, defiance of the government took place primarily online, not in street protests.\n\nOpen criticism of the regime on Twitter continued among Saudis until Mohammed came to power in 2017 and cracked down on online dissenters. Many well-known dissidents ended up in prison or in exile; others either joined the government\u2019s propaganda campaign or became targets of an unofficial \u201ctroll army\u201d \u2014 pro-government tweeters who launched apparently coordinated attacks on the regime\u2019s perceived enemies.\n\n\u201cGovernment-friendly media organizations and \u2018influencers\u2019 . . . flood[ed] the online space with propaganda, assisted by hordes of inauthentic accounts, consisting of both bots and human-operated trolls,\u201d according to a research report prepared for Twitter by Iyad el-Baghdadi, a Palestinian living in Norway who has spent years looking into the Saudi government\u2019s online messaging. \u201cThis propaganda machine seems to be centrally directed, as various parts of it work together to pump out propaganda, mob any remaining independent accounts, [and] threaten or intimidate\u201d opponents.\n\nBaghdadi, who had been working with Khashoggi on a study of Saudi propaganda, said he assisted de Becker and Bezos in their investigation. Baghdadi\u2019s report named Saud al-Qahtani, one of the crown prince\u2019s top advisers, as the regime\u2019s \u201cchief propagandist and \u2018troll master.\u2019 \u201d Qahtani, who has been accused of helping to plan the operation that led to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, used Twitter to warn Saudi dissidents that \u201cyou cannot hide behind anonymous accounts.\u201d He encouraged \u201cpatriotic citizens\u201d to inform on online critics of the government.\n\nFormer members of the troll network who have defected from Saudi Arabia describe themselves in Baghdadi\u2019s report as paid messengers whose government-related controllers told them what stories to tell online and which people to target for harassment.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi army of trolls is probably the best organized in the world,\u201d said Ali al-Ahmed, a Washington-based Saudi political analyst who has been critical of the regime. \u201cThe government has created millions of Twitter accounts of real and fake influencers. They have a troll warehouse in Riyadh, with thousands of people working there.\u201d\n\nA Twitter spokesperson said this month that the company has \u201ctaken action on hundreds of thousands of spammy accounts in Saudi Arabia\u201d that failed to conform with Twitter guidelines requiring state-backed information operations to be transparent about their ties to a government.\n\nTwitter also announced that it had detected and permanently suspended six accounts linked to Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-controlled media outlets. The accounts \u201cpresented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\n\nDigital attacks on Bezos began soon after the Khashoggi killing, coming from Saudi-based Twitter accounts. Those attacks multiplied after The Post published editorials and columns squarely placing responsibility for the murder on the Saudi government.\n\nBezos\u2019s security chief, de Becker, argued in the Daily Beast that the Saudis targeted the billionaire for criticism both because of The Post\u2019s reporting on Khashoggi\u2019s murder and because Bezos canceled his appearance at Mohammed\u2019s Davos in the Desert conference.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Bezos was in the crosshairs of the Saudis,\u201d al-Ahmed said. \u201cMohammed bin Salman is someone who takes things personally. What The Washington Post did by giving Jamal Khashoggi a job \u2014 that\u2019s taken as a personal slight. That led to the attacks on Bezos.\u201d\n\nThat fall, the Enquirer prepared its expos\u00e9 about Bezos\u2019s affair. Published on Jan. 9, the story led to renewed Twitter attacks against Bezos from Saudi accounts. \u201cJeff Bezos has incited against Saudi Arabia and its leadership for weeks via his Washington Post, and now has been struck by a marital infidelity scandal that will cost him half his fortune in the divorce,\u201d a typical tweet said. \u201cWhoever earns Saudi Arabia\u2019s enmity will be broken, disparaged, and ended by God.\u201d\n\nAccording to Baghdadi\u2019s report, a top-ranking Saudi official sets the narrative for such tweet attacks and communicates it to influencers, many of them paid operatives, each controlling dozens of Twitter accounts.\n\n\u201cThe influencers are paid $3,000 a month to push these narratives, which they receive on special Telegram channels that tell them who to tweet at,\u201d Baghdadi said.\n\nBaghdadi detailed how trolls disseminated anti-Bezos messages \u2014 calls for a boycott of Amazon, and attacks on employees of Amazon and Souq.com \u2014 after Turkish authorities confirmed that Saudi agents had murdered Khashoggi.\n\nAnother wave of anti-Bezos material appeared after the Enquirer\u2019s expos\u00e9 and again after de Becker accused the Saudis of playing a role in that story.\n\nSome defenders of the Saudi government call Baghdadi a biased source whose antipathy toward the regime colors his research. They view de Becker as a hired hand seeking to blame a third party for the notoriety stemming from the Enquirer report about Bezos\u2019s affair.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi government understands that Bezos is not driving editorial policy at The Washington Post,\u201d said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi national who often defends the country\u2019s government in his role as founder of the Washington-based Arabia Foundation. \u201cSeems like a brilliant diversionary tactic by de Becker to throw a \u2018Saudi conspiracy\u2019 into the pot and distract everybody from, shall we say, more delicate issues.\u201d\n\nShihabi said the tweetstorm against Bezos \u201ccould have come from tweeps who are government-employed, but I doubt it was a result of a strategy ordered from above. Most of these tweeps are kids in their 20s . . . and could easily have emerged from the Saudi twittersphere collectively and simplistically deciding Bezos should be a target.\u201d\n\nA Saudi official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, called the idea that the Saudis had ginned up attacks on Bezos \u201ca very smart PR strategy by this Gavin de Becker to distract everyone\u201d from the controversy over the explicit photos that Bezos wrote about in his blog post. \u201cSaudi Arabia has said, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll keep social media open, but we\u2019ll try to influence the conversation,\u2019 so they hire 100 or 200 university graduates to put out tweets. But nobody at a senior level says, \u2018Let\u2019s hit Bezos on Twitter.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA tip from a security agency\n\nIn May, Baghdadi said, two Norwegian intelligence agents showed up unannounced at his home in Oslo and took him to a secure location outside the city, where they informed him that they had received a tip from a foreign security agency that he was the target of a threat against his life from Saudi Arabia. A spokesman for the PST, Norway\u2019s intelligence agency, declined to comment.\n\nBaghdadi said the Norwegian authorities indicated that they had received the tip from the CIA. A U.S. official familiar with the case confirmed that American officials provided the information to the Norwegians. Another vocal critic of the Saudis\u2019 online propaganda efforts, Omar Abdul\u00adaziz, a Saudi who is living in Canada, said the Saudis\u2019 attacks on Bezos have subsided in recent months, focusing instead on criticism of Turkey.\n\nBaghdadi said he believes any threat against him resulted from his role in that research.\n\n\u201cIyad has been a thorn in these guys\u2019 side,\u201d said Javier El-Hage, chief legal officer for the Human Rights Foundation, a nonprofit organization in New York.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 special investigator appointed to examine the Khashoggi murder, Agnes Callamard, asked Norway\u2019s government to provide extra protection for Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cI have taken this threat seriously, absolutely,\u201d Callamard said in an interview. \u201cOne would have expected demonstrable steps from Saudi Arabia toward holding the responsible people to account, but so far, I have not found any evidence of tangible steps to assure that actions against dissidents are no longer the policy of the state. In view of what we are being told about the credible threats against Iyad, it is super important for intelligence agencies and police in countries where dissidents are living that they scale up their protection.\u201d", "description": "Khashoggi killing and revelations of Bezos\u2019s affair stalled Amazon\u2019s plan to build Saudi data centers.", "authors": ["Marc Fisher", "Senior Editor Reporting On A Wide Range Of Topics", "Jonathan O'Connell", "Reporter Covering Economic Development With A Focus On Commercial Real Estate", "The Trump Organization"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N8-kIrx7EMaTKBfLJodk8r_YRtA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYDJWFHFDUI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
