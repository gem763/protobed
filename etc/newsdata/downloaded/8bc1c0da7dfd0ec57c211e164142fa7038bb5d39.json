Much. Winning.\n\nAnd, of course, the whole reason Democrats are so glued to this idea of impeaching Mr. Trump is that they look at their current field of candidates for 2020 and realize that Mr. Trump is on the verge of getting re-elected.\n\nThat much winning really might just put Democrats over the edge, if by then there are still any edges left for them to go over.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House \u201cintelligence\u201d committee about Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to look into foreign meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nThe whole thing quickly devolved into another comical farce when Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat and \u201cintelligence\u201d chairman, kicked off the hearing by setting aside the just released transcript of the telephone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine. He chose instead to read an entirely made up, fraudulent and fabricated transcript of a call that never occurred.\n\nAnd these people wonder why nobody takes them seriously. They are confused why American citizens have such disdain for these people and their ridiculous antics.\n\nMr. Schiff was later forced to explain his fabricated accusations. \u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least part in parody.\u201d\n\nSeriously? We thought you said this is a serious matter?\n\nHenceforth, Mr. Schiff should be forced to stand, raise his right hand under oath and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if he wants to participate in any future hearings.\n\nAs Mr. Schiff\u2019s little tempest in a teacup began to fizzle away, Democrats were left grasping at other fabricated accusations.\n\nAs usual, they settled on accusing Mr. Trump of a cover-up. Of what exactly? A cover-up of a non-crime? Did he attempt to cover up the simple fact that he was doing his job?\n\nAt any rate, it is hard to accuse Mr. Trump of a cover-up when he is the one who unilaterally declassified the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president as well as the official complaint by the hearsay gossip \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nCertainly, if Mr. Trump is running a cover-up here, he is doing a very bad job of it.\n\nThe most delightful moment of the day came with Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and ranking member on the \u201cintelligence\u201d committee, reminded Mr. Schiff and the rest of the world that it was, in fact, Mr. Schiff himself who was caught on tape conspiring to collect nude pictures of a political opponent from a Ukrainian government official.\n\nThat political opponent, of course, was Donald Trump.\n\nAnd, unlike the phone call Mr. Schiff fabricated during the House hearing, Mr. Schiff\u2019s efforts to get a foreign government to meddle in a U.S. election was caught on tape. For all the world to hear.\n\nSeriously. Nude pictures. Of a sitting president. From a foreign government.\n\nThese people are truly sick.\n\n\u2022 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
