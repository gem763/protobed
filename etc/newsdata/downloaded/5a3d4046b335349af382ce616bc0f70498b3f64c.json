I\u2019m also optimistic that a path exists for Republicans to recapture a majority in the House, and that I could return for two more years as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,\" Rep. Walden told Politico. \"But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.\"\n\n\"So, I will not seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives, nor election to any other office, but instead I will close the public service chapter of my life, thankful for the friends I\u2019ve made and the successful work we\u2019ve done together,\" Walden added.\n\nWalden is now the 17th Republican retiring before the 2020 election.\n\nThe Oregon Republican has previously departed from President Donald J. Trump on key legislative issues, including border security:\n\nvia Politico: Walden maintains that he hasn\u2019t gotten any flak from GOP leadership for crossing party lines, but says he did get \u201cbeat up from the base\u201d back home for his votes on the border wall. Walden supported a resolution to kill the president\u2019s national emergency declaration to build the wall and then voted to override Trump\u2019s veto of the measure. While he did fear a public lashing from the president, Walden also says the vote was a no-brainer for him. He supports building a border wall, but worries about the dangerous precedent of allowing the president to circumvent Congress\u2018 power of the purse. And Walden pointed out that, since there wasn\u2019t enough support on Capitol Hill to ultimately overturn the veto, he had more leeway to cast his vote however he wanted. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to what the president is trying to do\u201d on border security, Walden said. \u201cBut \u2026 in my heart of hearts, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what Rep. Walden will do next in his career.", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:13:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/268/a41f3a2b-f47f-4107-a239-f820b01b62f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
