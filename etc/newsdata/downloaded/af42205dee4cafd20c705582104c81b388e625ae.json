The Kurds lead a group of Syria fighters who have been steadfast and effective American allies in combating the Islamic State in Syria. Turkey, however, sees the Kurds as terrorists and a border threat.\n\nJoseph Votel, a retired Army general who headed Central Command\u2019s military operations in Syria until last spring, wrote on The Atlantic website Tuesday that mutual trust was a key ingredient in the U.S. partnership with the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThe sudden policy change this week breaks that trust at the most crucial juncture and leaves our partners with very limited options,\u201d Votel wrote.\n\nJonathan Schanzer, a Syria scholar at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said even a limited Turkish incursion into northern Syria could quickly escalate.\n\n\u201cThe president is doubling down on this \u2014 seems to be reversing course,\u201d Schanzer said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to convey to the American people that he\u2019s made the right decision. Of course, (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan is going to see this as a green light.\u201d\n\nThe confusion began Sunday when the White House issued a late-night statement saying U.S. forces in northeastern Syria would step aside for what it called an imminent Turkish invasion. The statement made no mention of U.S. efforts to forestall the invasion, leading many to conclude that Trump was, in effect, turning a blind eye to a slaughter of Kurds.\n\nOn Monday, amid criticism from some of his staunchest Republican supporters, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump suggested he was washing his hands of the Syria conflict, saying in a tweet that \u201cit is time now for others in the region \u2026 to protect their own territory.\u201d But he also threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if its military action in Syria went too far.\n\nAdministration officials argue that Trump is employing strategy in response to Erdogan\u2019s insistence during a phone call Sunday with Trump that he was moving ahead with a military incursion into Syria. Erdogan seemed to have rejected a joint U.S.-Turkish plan, already being carried out, to create a buffer zone on the Syrian side of the border to address Turkey\u2019s security concerns. The execution of that plan included dismantling some Kurdish defensive positions on the Syrian side of the border.\n\nWithout initially saying his administration was still trying to talk Erdogan out of invading, Trump ordered the 50 to 100 U.S. troops inside that zone to pull back for safety\u2019s sake. He then emphasized his desire to withdraw from Syria entirely, although no such broader pullout has begun.\n\nU.S. military leaders have recommended keeping U.S. troops in Syria to ensure a long-term defeat of IS. Pentagon officials said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Mark Esper and the new Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, participated in Trump\u2019s phone call with Erdogan on Sunday, contrary to some reports that Pentagon leaders had been blindsided by the decision to pull troops back. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, Turkish troops on Tuesday were massed along the border in apparent preparation for an incursion across the border. But they said that so far there have been no signs of an actual assault beginning.\n\nThe officials, who were not authorized to discuss details of military intelligence, said there are between 5,000 and 10,000 Turkish troops along the border apparently ready to go. The officials said they expect the Turks to begin with airstrikes, followed by barrages from heavy artillery along the border and the movement of ground troops into Syria.\n\nKurdish forces have some air defenses, such as shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, but would be outgunned by the Turks.\n\nTrump has boasted about U.S. success in defeating the so-called Islamic State, but his critics now accuse him of abandoning a U.S. ally, setting the Kurds up to be killed. They also worry that if the Kurds end up fighting Turkish forces, they won\u2019t be able to guard detention centers in Syria that house thousands of captured IS fighters.\n\nTrump supporters say the president\u2019s threat of sanctions could make Erdogan second-guess his planned incursion or perhaps limit it so as not to be slapped with financial penalties that would hurt the Turkish economy. Trump on Monday said he was fulfilling a campaign promise to withdraw from \u201cendless war\u201d in the Middle East, and he warned Turkey that he would ruin its economy if any American personnel are harmed.\n\nStriking a notably friendlier tone, Trump on Tuesday said Erdogan will visit the White House on Nov. 13. He defended Ankara as a big U.S. trading partner, saying it supplies steel for F-35 fighter jets. In fact, the Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program last summer because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. As part of that process, the U.S. will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March 2020.\n\nTrump said Turkey understands that \u201cany unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s vice president said his country won\u2019t bow to threats in an apparent response to Trump\u2019s warning to Ankara about the scope of its planned military incursion into Syria.\n\nFuat Oktay said in a speech Tuesday that Turkey is intent on combatting Kurdish fighters across its border in Syria and on creating a zone that would allow Turkey to resettle Syrian refugees there.\n\n\u201cWhere Turkey\u2019s security is concerned, we determine our own path, but we set our own limits,\u201d Oktay said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C.
