The company issued a voluntary recall of the lot that bottle came from on Friday (file)\n\nAsbestos naturally forms alongside talc, the mineral base for Baby Powder, in nature.\n\nBut this doesn't always happen, so talc mines are supposed to be tested for asbestos and, if they're positive, are to be avoided.\n\nFor decades, J&J claimed that its powder was asbestos-free.\n\nBut a Reuters investigation published last year suggested that that wasn't always the case - and the company knew.\n\nAccording to the report, from 1971 through the early 2000s, Baby Powder periodically tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and company higher-ups did not disclose the findings.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of Americans were developing mesothelioma, a rare cancer of the a tissue that lines and protects certain organs, including the lungs and chest cavity.\n\nIt accounts for just 0.3 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the US and, for those with pleural mesothelioma, the average survival time is only about 12 to 14 months, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) considers the links between mesothelioma and asbestos strong enough to say that the toxin causes the cancer.\n\nAnd since its discovery in Baby Powder, more than 13,000 lawsuits have been filed against J&J, claiming that its products had led to cancers and deaths.\n\nEarlier this week, yet another study, published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, found that asbestos in taclum powder causes cancer.\n\nMany of the suits are ongoing, but have already cost the company many billions of dollars.\n\nThe contamination announced Friday consisted of 0.00002 percent asbestos - less than a trace, but nonetheless evidence the carcinogen is still finding its way into talc powders.\n\nJ&J 'has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA's own testing on prior occasions - and as recently as last month - found no asbestos,' the company said in a statement.\n\nThe bottle in question was bought from an online retailer and J&J says that it is investigating whether the test could be a false positive, if the bottle could have been contaminated or if the product might have been a counterfeit.", "description": "Food and Drug Administration tests found 'sub-trace' amounts of asbestos, a contaminant linked to cancer in a bottle of Baby Powder.
