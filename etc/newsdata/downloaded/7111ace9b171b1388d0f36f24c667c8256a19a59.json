Guyger said that she\u2019d confused his apartment for her own and believed he was an intruder, shooting at him in self-defense.\n\n\u201cI thought it was my apartment,\u201d Guyger told dispatchers 19 times on the frantic 911 call played in court. \u201cI thought it was my apartment. I\u2019m fucked. Oh my God. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nGuyger, who now faces up to 99 years in prison, will be sentenced on Tuesday afternoon. According to reporters in the courtroom, the ex-cop and her mother began to cry as soon as the verdict was read, while Jean\u2019s mom threw both of her arms up in the air.\n\nSeveral of Jean\u2019s family members also embraced members of the prosecution team. Outside the courtroom, his family shared hugs, as supporters cheered, \u201cIt\u2019s a new day!\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\n\nThroughout the week-long trial, prosecutors argued that Guyger was \u201cdistracted\u201d by her affair with her partner and missed all the signs that suggested she was in the wrong apartment. Attorneys for Guyger, however, claimed that the off-duty cop was simply \u201cexhausted\u201d after a 13-hour shift, using the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d code of penal law to defend her actions.\n\n\u201cMistake of fact is the same thing that you\u2019re hearing when you hear the police say, \u2018We thought he had a gun,\u2019\u201d Dallas defense attorney Russell Wilson told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nThe defense also called on the Castle Doctrine, a version of \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, which gives people broad protections for the use of force in self-defense of a person\u2019s property, allowing a person to use lethal force against an intruder in their own home. The prosecution argued against allowing the jury to consider the doctrine.\n\nDuring a private session with the prosecution and defense teams before jury deliberations on Monday, Judge Tammy Kemp ruled the jury could consider the Castle Doctrine, as well as the lesser manslaughter charge, during their deliberations.\n\nThe sequestered jurors deliberated for about five hours on whether or not it was reasonable for Guyger to believe she was in her own home at the time of the shooting. They ultimately concluded it was not.\n\nBelieving she was on the third floor, prosecutors argued, the five-year veteran was so distracted when she parked at her Dallas apartment building that she didn\u2019t notice walking to Jean\u2019s fourth-floor apartment\u2014despite his bright red doormat.\n\n\u201cI mean, my God. This is crazy. It was unreasonable\u2014she should\u2019ve known she was in the wrong apartment,\u201d Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Jason Fine said at the trial.\n\nGuyger testified in court Friday that she was exhausted on the night of the shooting and mistakenly parked on the wrong floor. The ex-cop said she had been talking with her police partner, Martin Rivera, as she parked her car on the fourth floor of the apartment complex.\n\n\u201cI was just ready to go home,\u201d she told jurors, describing her mindset as she approached Jean\u2019s door.\n\nAccording to Guyger, she believed someone was inside her apartment when she noticed the door was unlocked and hearing the sound of someone walking inside the dark apartment. She said she ordered Jean multiple times to show her his hands, but he continued to walk towards her, shouting, \u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that he was coming at me. I was scared he was gonna kill me,\u201d she said, admitting she was shooting to kill when she pulled the trigger. After shooting Jean, Guyger said she realized she was in the wrong apartment and \u201chad no idea\u201d where she was.\n\n\u201cI compare it to being in a car wreck,\u201d she testified. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d\n\nWhile fighting back tears, Guyger added, \u201cI ask God for forgiveness, and I hate myself every single day. I wish he was the one with the gun who had killed me. I never wanted to take an innocent person's life.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution probed at Guyger\u2019s actions after making the grave discovery. During cross-examination, Fine accused Guyger of not reacting to the best of her abilities. Guyger said she gave Jean a \u201clittle CPR,\u201d but also said she stopped CPR in order to figure out where she was and call 911.\n\nThe ex-cop has previously claimed it was not until she turned on the lights and emergency dispatchers asked for her address that she realized she was in the wrong apartment unit.\n\nGuyger also admitted to texting her married police partner in the minutes after the shooting. Prosecutors previously revealed that while she was still on the phone with emergency dispatchers, Guyger texted Rivera, \u201cHurry, I need you. I fucked up.\u201d\n\nThe two partners talked on the phone three minutes before the incident. According to prosecutors, the \u201cintimate\u201d nature of that phone call \u201cdistracted\u201d Guyger.\n\n\u201cPrior to that conversation Amber Guyger was able to effectively do her job,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus said during his opening statement. \u201cAmber Guyger made a series of unreasonable errors and unreasonable decisions and unreasonable choices.\u201d\n\nFine called Guyger\u2019s story \u201ccrazy.\u201d After the defense\u2019s closing statements Fine began reading from Guyger\u2019s own testimony\u2014in which she said she never wanted \u201canybody to have to go through or even imagine going through what I felt that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me? That is garbage,\u201d Fine said, crumpling up a copy of the testimony and throwing it in the trash. \u201cMost of what she said was garbage. Ninty-nine percent of this trial has been about the defendant.\u201d\n\nDefense attorney Toby Shook did not rely on gaining sympathy for Guyger from the jury.\n\nInstead, he argued that the prosecution did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Guyger intended to kill that night. Shook characterized the shooting as a \u201chorrible perfect storm\u201d and that Guyger made a \u201chorrible, horrible mistake,\u201d but that did not equate to murder or even manslaughter.\n\n\u201cYou can be angry with her. You can hate her, but you can't convict her because there's no evidence as to the decisions that were made in that apartment,\u201d Shook said.", "description": "The former cop killed her black neighbor, Botham Jean, after mistaking his Dallas apartment for her own.
