It\u2019s a ballad, an Irish song, it\u2019s basically about me and her. So it\u2019s a sad song.\n\n\"If I can get through that, I think that could bring the house down.\n\n\"The biggest part of doing X Factor was Tanya. She loved the show, she thought it would be brilliant. I\u2019m like, \u2018No no, really?\u2019 She was like \u2018yeah you\u2019ll be brilliant, I love it,\u2019 then my daughter jumped in, Kaley, and she\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to do it.\n\n\"It gave Tanya something to look forward to, to come over to London and get well for.\n\n\"Sadly it was a bridge too far for her.\"\n\n*X Factor: Celebrity airs tonight on ITV at 8.20pm", "description": "X Factor bosses have scrapped the large scale studio audience ahead of the first live show of the celeb series", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703266.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screen-Shot-2019-10-20-at-183830-2-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
