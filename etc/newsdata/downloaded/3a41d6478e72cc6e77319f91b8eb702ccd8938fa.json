The strike ended at the end of their discussion. [YONHAP]\n\nThousands of non-regular workers at schools including cafeteria cooks and bus drivers in Korea will not go on strike later this week after reaching a resolution on ongoing negotiations with the government for a pay raise.\u201cThe two parties finally bridged the differences and reached a point of compromise on Monday night,\u201d a representative of a national union of non-permanent school workers said during a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe urge the Ministry of Education to quickly implement the promises on related discussions including regular salary.\u201dThe Ministry of Education and a national union of non-permanent school workers began their closed-door negotiations on a pay raise on Monday in Jongno District, central Seoul. The union, who at first demanded a 5.45 percent raise to their pay, accommodated the ministry\u2019s demand and agreed on a 1.8 percent raise. They also agreed on a 2.8 percent hike in the rate of base salary and a 40,000 won ($34) increase to their monthly transportation fees for next year.Long-service allowance, a policy to pay 32,500 won monthly for non-regular workers who have been employed for over a year, was the last-minute issue that prolonged the negotiations. Neither side appeared willing to budge on their demands, with the union calling for a 5,000 won increase to long-service allowance, and the ministry looking to postpone discussions on the issue until next year. The two parties eventually agreed on a 2,500 won increase to long-service allowance.The union leaders\u2019 hunger strike, which had lasted for 15 days in front of the Blue House demanding abolition of discrimination between regular and non-regular workers and regular salary, was officially stopped on Tuesday after the two parties reached the tentative agreement.There are 142,000 non-regular workers at schools across the country, which include cafeteria cooks and bus drivers. Of them, 67 percent, or around 95,000, are members of the union. The last time the negotiation fell through in July, around 22,000 workers went on strike and about 2,800 schools had to stop serving lunch during those days.Ahead of the national union\u2019s press conference, Deputy Prime Minister for Society and Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae and Superintendent of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education Cho Hee-yeon visited the people who were on the hunger strike Tuesday. Education Minister Yoo said, \u201cWe will form a pan-governmental committee for government, labor and management regarding public officials and further discuss the salary system.\u201dA signing ceremony regarding the two parties\u2019 agreement, which will be organized by Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education, has been scheduled for early next week.BY JEON MIN-HEE, CHEA SARAH [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/15201434.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
