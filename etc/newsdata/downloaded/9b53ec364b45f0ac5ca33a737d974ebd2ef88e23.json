The total cost of attending the state school per year can range from $30,000 for in-state students to more than $75,000 for out-of-state students, according to the university's website.\n\nSarah Cramer Shields\n\nAdditional money from the Walentas' donation will go towards funding scholarships for first-generation college graduates who attend the university's MBA program. Walentas is a 1964 graduate of the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business.\n\nThe remaining $25 million of the $100 million will go toward professorships and fellowships through the Darden School of Business and the university's Jefferson Scholars Foundation.\n\nAcross the country, around 30% of all entering college freshmen are considered first-generation college students, meaning they are the first in their families to attend college, according to the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\nColleges and universities have increased efforts to attract and support first-generation students, including the University of Virginia which says it saw a 20% increase this year from last in the number of first-generation students in its freshmen class.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images, FILE\n\nColleges have also started paying attention to the particular impact student debt has on first-generation students, who are often turned away from completing or even beginning their college degrees because of it, experts say.\n\nNearly 74% of first-generation students in the class of 2015-16 borrowed money for their undergraduate education. The average debt for first-generation students is nearly $30,700, according to the NCES.\n\nFor first-generation students -- students whose parents do not have a Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher -- the average debt was nearly $30,700.\n\nFirst-generation students often do not have parental help when filling out financial forms, do not have a safety net of family wealth to fall back on and may be exempt from federal loans or financial aid if they are undocumented.\n\n\"Around 54% of first-gen students don\u2019t complete their degree, and we know when students fail to complete [their degree], they tend to be one of the default members,\" Natalia Abrams, who founded a non-profit advocacy group, Student Debt Crisis, told \"Good Morning America\" last year. \"It's just that vicious cycle where then they can fall into default, have their own financial struggles and it just creates lack of generational wealth that leads to it happening over and over again.\"", "description": "David Walentas, who made the donation with his wife Jane, is a first-gen student.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/uva-campus-gty-ps-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
