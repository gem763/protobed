They diagnosed all five with lipoid pneumonia.\n\n\n\nThe illnesses have prompted a health scare that has led U.S. officials to urge people to stop vaping, especially products containing tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the marijuana ingredient that produces a high. Several states have also banned some vaping products and flavourings in response to the outbreak.\n\nNew letter describes 17 patients, all of whom vaped, who had lung biopsies after presenting with symptoms and bilateral pulmonary opacities that led to a clinical diagnosis of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaping?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vaping</a>-associated lung injury. <a href=\"https://t.co/n5rF2OOOwq\">https://t.co/n5rF2OOOwq</a> \u2014@NEJM\n\n\n\nScientists have been working to understand the role of these oil-filled cells, known as lipid-laden macrophages, to help explain how vaping can cause lung injuries in otherwise healthy adults.\n\n\n\nOne possibility is that the oil is coming directly from oils inhaled in vaping devices, such as oils containing THC.\n\n\n\nSo far, 87 per cent of 86 people in Illinois and Wisconsin who got sick from vaping admitted to having used e-cigarette products containing THC, but 71 per cent also reported using nicotine-containing products.\n\n\n\nAnother theory, backed by studies in mice, is that in some patients, the fat-clogged immune cells are forming as part of the body's natural response to exposure to solvents or other chemicals used in vaping devices.
