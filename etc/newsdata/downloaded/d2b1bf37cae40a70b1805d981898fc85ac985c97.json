The only other players with that many 40-double campaigns are David Ortiz and Wade Boggs.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOrtiz's best streak was a two-year stretch from 2004-05 where he hit 47 and 40 doubles respectively, while Boggs went seven straight seasons with at least 40 doubles from 1985-91.\n\nBetts still has someone to chase in this category with Boggs, but the consistency he's displayed producing extra-base hits is incredible.\n\nHe's still in the early part of his career, and there's still a question of him staying with the team long term given his upcoming free agency. If Betts can stay with the Red Sox and continue this kind of consistency, it won't be crazy to place him over some of the best hitters in Boston history not named Ted Williams.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
