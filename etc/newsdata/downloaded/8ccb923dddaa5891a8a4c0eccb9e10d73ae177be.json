The initial share price reaction to the results reflect a leap of faith.'\n\nDespite the positive notes and eye on the future, Beighton warned: 'I think there is a very unsettled customer environmental out there. There is an awful lot of global uncertainty for the consumer.'\n\nHowever, just last month Asos's newer rival Boohoo posted a 43 per cent jump in first-half sales as well as a 53 per cent rise in earnings.\n\nDavid Madden from CMC Markets said: 'These stellar numbers shows that a well-run online fashion house can thrive in a downbeat climate.'", "description": "During the torrid year, Asos shares suffered an almighty fall from grace, from highs of around \u00a360 per share last August to just \u00a323 at the start of this month.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
