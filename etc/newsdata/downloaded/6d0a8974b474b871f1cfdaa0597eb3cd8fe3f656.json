Gwen/Blake rivalry heats up on 'The Voice' \u2014 with hilarious results", "language": "en", "text": "A few seasons ago, when Kelly Clarkson joined The Voice, NBC made over the show\u2019s iconic red chairs with snazzy new extras like heated seat cushions and shiny chrome cup-holders. This season, to welcome back coach Gwen Stefani, Gwen\u2019s boyfriend Blake apparently decided to upgrade his own chair\u2026 with a red button that plays Gwen\u2019s hit \u201cDon\u2019t Speak\u201d on demand whenever he wants to silence any of his rival coaches.\n\nIt was all going so well Tuesday, until Blake hilariously, accidentally hit his \u201cDon\u2019t Speak\u201d button while getting worked up trying to win over 21-year-old singer-songwriter Kiara Brown \u2014 thus effectively silencing himself mid-sentence and giving his secret away. Gwen was so faux-shocked that she called her own significant other a \u201cliar and a cheater.\u201d Kelly additionally accused Blake of \u201csitting on a [red, spinning] throne of lies,\u201d while John Legend added, \u201cI don't know how Gwen can be in a relationship with someone who has this many problems with telling the truth!\u201d\n\nBlake, intent on maintaining his track record as the winningest coach in Voice history, even if it means using his own girlfriend\u2019s song to carry out his dastardly schemes, merely shrugged, \u201cI have my tactics I use to get artists that I want on my team. I'll stop at nothing, even if I have to lie to these three.\u201d However, Blake admitted that he\u2019s \u201cgot to be better at lying\u201d if he expects to win this season.\n\nKiara, whose pretty, understated Blind Audition of Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d turned both Gwen and Blake\u2019s chairs, didn\u2019t fall for Blake\u2019s lies \u2014 or even for his glowing, presumably honest praise when he described her vocals as \u201chypnotic.\u201d Instead, Kiara went for Gwen, who compared her honeyed tone and subtle style to that of Kacey Musgraves. Gwen clearly came to win this season, and she\u2019s not taking Season 17 lightly. \u201cThis is a competition, and the gloves are off,\u201d she declared Monday.\n\nStill, this was all in good fun, and it was damn good TV. Kelly was laughing so hard during the \u201cDon\u2019t Speak\u201d incident that she nearly toppled over, cackling, \u201cThat was maybe my favorite part of anything I've seen on The Voice!\u201d Gwen actually busted a move to her own song, and she\u2019ll probably enjoy any iTunes or Spotify spikes the Tragic Kingdom ballad might get from all this NBC exposure. (Admit it: \u201cDon\u2019t Speak\u201d is totally lodged in your brain now. This was the best use of the song on The Voice since Team Gwen\u2019s Hunter Plake and Gwen performed it as a duet in Season 12.)\n\nThese were the other successful auditions of the night:\n\nMendeleyev, 28: \"Girl from the North Country\"\n\nThe born-in-a-bathtub, raised-by-vegetarian-hippies-in-Santa-Barbara yoga dude, whose full name is Mendeleyev Galileo Einstein Pythagoras Darwin Euclid Leonardo Alan Blitz, might have seemed like a joke contestant. But he totally wasn\u2019t. He dedicated his Bob Dylan cover to his mother, who died a month before his audition (\u201cOne of the last things that she said was \u2018I'm sorry that I'm not going to get to see you on The Voice\u2019\u201d), and his resonant, husky, deeply aching voice was very Hozier-meets-Tom Waits. Kelly likened Mendeleyev\u2019s vocals to \u201cthe best glass of pinot noir\u201d or a \u201cwarm blanket,\u201d and said she\u2019d love to hear his voice on vinyl.\n\nWho turned? All four coaches.\n\nResult: Team Legend. John was apparently the only coach familiar with Mendeleyev\u2019s favorite artist, Richie Havens, and that sealed the deal.\n\nJake Hoot, 30: \u201cWhen It Rains It Pours\u201d\n\nSince Jake, the Texas-born son of two missionaries, spent more of his formative years living in the Dominican Republic, I assumed/hoped his performance would Latin flavor, maybe some Tejano-type flair. But this was straight-up generic country. On the plus side, straight-up generic country tends to do very, very well on The Voice.\n\nWho turned? Only Kelly, because she\u2019d cleverly tricked Blake into thinking she\u2019d used her Block button on Jake. (She hadn\u2019t! She too sits on a throne of lies!)\n\nResult: Team Kelly.\n\nCalvin Lockett, 25: \u201cJust My Imagination\u201d\n\nCalvin sounded nervous and quaky, but this Temptations covers was butter-smooth, without any superfluous, show-offy runs and tricks. John called the performance \u201cmasterful\u201d and compared Calvin to Damien Rice \u2013 a thoughtful and unexpected compliment.\n\nWho turned? John, Gwen, Blake.", "description": "In a 'Voice' first, Blake has upgraded with a secret button that plays \u201cDon\u2019t Speak\u201d whenever he wants to silence any of his rival coaches.", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q2sq0D2gLRW598iNG9tfWg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ce69e8f0-e41e-11e9-beb7-36880a280cf6", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
