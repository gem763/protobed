The person filming can be heard laughing.\n\nAs the ranting continues the man videoing the scene taunts them saying \u201cgo to school\u201d, adding \u201cyour mum probably has a Sunday roast waiting for you at home\u201d.\n\nBut the scene becomes even more chaotic as the girls start running around the store, one of them even screams as she jumps on a display bed.\n\nAnother guard arrives and the girls are eventually escorted out of the store.\n\n\u201cMaitland\u2019s finest,\u201d the man jokes as they leave.\n\nSince being shared on Facebook today, the post has already been shared more than 11,000 times and attracted 17,000 comments, with many describing the girls\u2019 behaviour as \u201cdisgusting\u201d.\n\nA local resident known as Jacinta posted the video on her profile after it was removed from the Facebook page of the man who filmed the incident.\n\nShe told news.com.au that the girls are well known to her as they live nearby. She says she\u2019s caught them destroying her elderly neighbours\u2019 fences and property, and they often yell abuse at her.\n\nShe also posted footage of the girls confronting and getting into fights with other girls. She said she believed attention needed to be brought to what they were doing.\n\n\u201cI have witnessed them damage properties and assault people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI am scared to have my car parked in my own front yard because I know the high chances of having one of these teens walk by and damage my property.\n\n\u201cThey are being allowed to roam our streets at night and cause havoc without consequences.\u201d\n\nShe said she thought people were sharing the video \u201cbecause they are simply in shock and disgust that these girls and boys are still on our streets doing these horrible things and nothing serious is being done about it\u201d.\n\nNews.com.au has contacted NSW Police for a response.", "description": "Two teenage girls have been filmed causing chaos in a NSW department store, punching and screaming at people during an angry outburst.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/67e45384ebe02543382cfecdee4d8c00?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
