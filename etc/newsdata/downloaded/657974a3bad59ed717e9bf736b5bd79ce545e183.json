The Lebanese Army was dispatched to stop the violence, and public squares across Beirut filled with protesters shortly after.\n\nDuring a speech on Friday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the protests were no longer \u201cspontaneous\u201d and that they were funded by foreign embassies and countries, and he urged his supporters to avoid the protests.\n\nHe also said he opposed the fall of the government, warning that a power vacuum might be part of \u201csomeone preparing for a civil war, as they have in several regional and neighboring countries.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA vacuum would be a killer,\u201d he said.\n\nHariri was only one of several politicians whose resignation the protesters have demanded in recent days. Others include Aoun and Bassil, who has become a central figure in the calls to end the rule of the same political class for decades.\n\nAD\n\nFor nearly two weeks, makeshift checkpoints have stopped traffic on highways in Beirut and around the country. Protesters have set up tents and occupied streets and squares and highways all over Lebanon. Banks and schools have been closed for more than 10 days.\n\nAsser Khattab contributed reporting.\n\nAD", "description": "Thousands have demonstrated for change over high prices, unemployment and poor government services.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FsaL7rcad3ppZXnZyXQgBlfYWD0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3XP7MPX2LEI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
