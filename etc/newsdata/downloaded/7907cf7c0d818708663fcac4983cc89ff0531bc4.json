This film seems to suggest that O.J. Simpson -- the athlete and estranged husband who was acquitted of her murder in 1995 -- is not the alleged killer.\n\nVery quickly, the trailer shifts blame from O.J. to a man named Glen Rogers, a handyman Nicole hired to help around her house.\n\nO.J. SIMPSON JOINS TWITTER 25 YEARS AFTER THE MURDERS OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RON GOLDMAN\n\nAlso featured in the film is \"Orange Is the New Black\" star Taryn Manning, who plays Nicole's friend Faye Resnick. Interestingly, the film suggests that Nicole and Resnick may have been entangled in a romantic relationship.\n\nAlso making an appearance in the trailer was Kris Jenner during her days as a Kardashian. Kris was a close friend of Nicole's, and is the ex-wife of Robert Kardashian, one of O.J.'s lawyers.\n\n25 YEARS LATER, WHERE IS THE O.J. SIMPSON CHASE BRONCO?\n\nThe trailer ends with Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman -- who was also found dead at her home in '94 -- fighting for their lives.\n\nNo premiere date has been set as of yet.\n\nIn 2012, an Investigation Discovery documentary titled \"My Brother the Serial Killer,\" was released. It examines claims by Rogers' brother, Clay, who relays his brother's tale of confessing to the murders while on death row, according to People magazine. (Rogers was a serial killer known as the \"Casanova Killer\" convicted of killing two women.)\n\nGoldman's sister, Kim, slammed the controversial doc at the time.\n\nIn a statement, Kim said she was \u201cappalled at the level of irresponsibility demonstrated by the network and the producers of this so-called documentary,\u201d and that they were never notified that the main character had confessed to her brother\u2019s death.\n\nNicole's sister also spoke out, dismissing the revelations in the documentary, claiming Rogers is not as \u201cfamous as he wants to be.\"\n\nSimpson, however, sang a different tune. \"O.J. absolutely loves it,\u201d a source told Fox News in 2012. \u201cHe loves that the documentary is out and the idea that people are talking about him but he\u2019s not the one being blamed. Typical O.J. stuff.\u201d\n\nAlso in 2012, the LAPD responded to Rogers' claim.\n\n\"We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved,\" Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. \"Nevertheless, in the interest of being thorough in this case, our robbery homicide detectives will investigate his claims.\"\n\nAlthough Simpson ultimately was not convicted of killing Nicole and Goldman, he was ordered to pay a $33.5 million civil judgment to their families.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSimpson would eventually spend nine years in prison after being found guilty of the armed robbery of sports memorabilia from a hotel-casino in Las Vegas. He was released on parole in 2017.", "description": "A trailer dropped this morning for \"The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson,\" starring Mena Suvari as Nicole Brown Simpson.", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Mena-Suvari-Now.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
