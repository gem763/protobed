REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nThe bank\u2019s shares rose 4% in premarket trading on Thursday as its investment banking revenue outperformed those of its main rival Goldman Sachs, which reported a hit from its soured investments in Uber and WeWork.\n\nMorgan Stanley also booked losses from its investments in the IPO market, but M&A advisory and fixed income underwriting more than made up for the shortfall.\n\nThe big U.S. banks largely beat subdued expectations in a quarter that was overshadowed by trade tensions and worries of an economic slowdown that forced the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice.\n\n\u201cWe delivered strong quarterly earnings despite the typical summer slowdown and volatile markets,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said.\n\nGorman, however, added that he remained cautious given the ongoing trade talks between the United States and China and low interest rate environment.\n\nKBW equity analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said the bank\u2019s results were better than expected as revenue for each business beat the brokerage\u2019s forecasts.\n\nNet income attributable to the company rose marginally to $2.17 billion, or $1.27 per share, in the quarter. Net revenue inched up to $10 billion from $9.9 billion.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a profit of $1.11 per share on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nOverall sales and trading revenue rose 10%, driven mainly by a 21% jump in fixed-income sales and trading revenue.\n\nRevenue from investment banking, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, rose 4.3% to $1.64 billion.\n\nHowever, Morgan Stanley, which will handle Airbnb\u2019s much-awaited debut next year, swallowed heavy losses from stakes in companies that went public. Investment revenue plummeted to $33 million from $340 million a year ago.", "description": "Morgan Stanley capped quarterly earnings from big U.S. banks with a higher-than-expected profit on strength in bond trading and M&A advisory, easing concerns that market turmoil would weigh on banks' Wall Street-related businesses.", "authors": ["Anirban Sen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441870618&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G16I", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
