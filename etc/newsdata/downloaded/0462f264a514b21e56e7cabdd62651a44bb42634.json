One of the culprits, according to the commission\u2019s 9/11 report, was \u201clack of imagination.\u201d\n\nWith few exceptions, the report stated, government officials could not imagine that Osama bin Laden and his affiliates, hidden in a remote part of Afghanistan, could strike at the heart of America\u2019s financial, military and political power.\n\n\u201cTo us, Afghanistan seemed very far away,\u201d the report stated. \u201cTo members of al Qaeda, America seemed very close. In a sense, they were more globalized than we were.\u201d\n\nPrior to 9/11, according to the report, few colleges or universities offered courses in Middle Eastern languages or Islamic studies. The commission maintained that this made it difficult to recruit officers qualified for counterterrorism. Even though the U.S. has funded programs in foreign languages and area studies since the Cold War, the 9/11 attacks exposed our comparative ignorance of the Middle East.\n\nThe Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies would seem to represent the answer to the 9/11 report\u2019s call for a broader educational approach to national security. Founded in 2005, the consortium has a substantial number of students studying foreign languages. The program has 300 students studying Arabic, 44 studying Persian, and 91 students studying Urdu, the highest enrollment in Urdu language courses in the United States. Lack of Arabic linguists has been cited as one of the reasons the United States missed critical messages sent by al\u2013Qaiida about the 9/11 attacks a day before they occurred.\n\nThe Duke-UNC\u2019s program teaches on topics such as cybersecurity and countering violent extremism. Students may also take courses on music and movies in the Middle East.\n\nBut to the Trump administration, the Duke-UNC consortium isn\u2019t doing what it\u2019s supposed to do when it teaches students about Middle Eastern culture through movies, music and concerts.\n\nA \u2018Fundamental Misalignment\u2019\n\nIn August, assistant secretary for postsecondary education Robert King told the Duke-UNC consortium they were using federal funds the wrong way. In a letter published in the \u201cFederal Register,\u201d King informed the consortium that they are spending Title VI funds on unauthorized activities. Title VI of the Higher Education Act funds, among other things, strengthening undergraduate education, research on different areas of the world, and improvement of foreign language training.\n\n\u201cAlthough Iranian art and film may be of subjects of deep intellectual interest,\u201d King explained, such offerings represent \u201ca fundamental misalignment\u201d between the course offerings and Title VI\u2019s requirement that the programming advance the \u201csecurity, stability, and economic vitality of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, King criticizes the consortium for using federal money to support the writing of a paper titled \u201cRadical Love: Teachings from Islamic Mystical Tradition.\u201d He also had a problem with the program sponsoring a concert series that included a performance by hip hop artist Marco Pav\u00e9, also known as the \u201cmillennial Muslim from Memphis.\u201d\n\nIn my view as a political scientist who has written extensively about Islamic political thought, I maintain that these kinds of cultural programming can support America\u2019s national security interests widely construed.\n\nMovies teach a society what other peoples think and feel. They also offer insights into what their legitimate grievances are, such as American support for the Shah before the Iranian Revolution, and what attracts other people to America, such as freedom and music. Films such as \u201cPersepolis\u201d \u2013 about an Iranian girl who grows up during the Islamic Revolution \u2013 help to humanize Iranians and shed light on the complex relationship they have with Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nResources for Security\n\nThe federal government has given the Duke-UNC consortium an annual $235,000 Title VI grant as a National Resource Center to provide a \u201cfull understanding\u201d of the Middle East.\n\nThe Duke-UNC consortium\u2019s grant has been continued for the 2019-2020 academic year. However, by questioning the consortium\u2019s course offerings, the Trump administration is signaling that it has little regard for academic freedom and that it has a narrow view of what\u2019s important to national security.", "description": "A lack of understanding between American and Middle-Eastern culture is a national security risk.", "authors": ["Nicholas Tampio"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f0IqRGm3l7qLLbOD87yqFA--~B/aD05Njg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/d030cd45b3cf846db596faa01124740e", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
