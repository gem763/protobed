But the process was delayed by six months until November.\n\nCrucial technical steps contained within the agreement, such as creating a unified army and agreeing on the internal boundaries of states, have failed to make progress.\n\nAlan Boswell, a South Sudan expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG), said the only solution was Kiir and Machar coming to a political agreement on how to move forward with the deal.\n\n\"We have been waiting for this moment for a long time. The only way to find a path forward is for these two to meet. The path is wide open for them to form a unity government but they will need to strike new political deals to do that,\" he told AFP on Monday.\n\n\"If they fail to agree on a way forward with direct talks then we are looking at a major crisis.\"\n\n'We are one'\n\nFollowing their extraordinary meeting in the Vatican, Kiir told parliament he had forgiven Machar, and urged his rival to return home.\n\nBut Machar has been concerned about his personal security should he return to the capital.\n\nHe fled on foot under a hail of gunfire when a previous peace deal collapsed in July 2016.\n\nHe is currently living in Khartoum, the capital of neighbouring Sudan, the country from which South Sudan broke away to claim independence in 2011.\n\nHe was accompanied to Juba by Sudanese paramilitary commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who is best known by his nickname \"Hemeti\", and who is holding separate peace talks with Sudanese armed groups.\n\nSudan has been engaged in its own bloody transition toward peace since the overthrow of Omar al-Bashir in April.\n\nKiir urged the Sudanese groups to negotiate \"in good faith\" to bring peace to the region.\n\n\"I believe that we are one, and facing the same problem. If there is no peace in Sudan, there will be no peace in South Sudan,\" Kiir said.\n\nThe fighting in South Sudan has left about 380 000 people dead and forced more than four million South Sudanese - almost a third of the population - to flee their homes.", "description": "South Sudan's exiled rebel leader Riek Machar has arrived in Juba for the first time in a year and held rare talks with President Salva Kiir as the rivals try to salvage a stalled peace agreement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8173/34fef0fdd92f46ef9050dd5ece7d01e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
