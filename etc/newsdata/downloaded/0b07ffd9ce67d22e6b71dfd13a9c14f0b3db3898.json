Their views on and experiences with racism, crime and poverty are worth understanding \u2014 because they're kids.\n\nMACON, Ga. \u2014 Jy\u2019Nivea Troutman hides on the floor of her bedroom when she hears gunshots outside her window. That\u2019s just what you do on Saturday nights in her neighborhood, she\u2019ll tell you.\n\nBut Troutman, 16, would much rather talk to you about her school\u2019s dress code. She thinks that her school\u2019s policy is too strict \u2014 and that girls are more likely to be penalized for wearing what they love. She even made a 16-minute podcast episode about it.\n\nTroutman learned the basics of audio reporting in a podcasting workshop I led in Macon as part of my participation in Report for America.\n\nThroughout the school year, I spent a couple hours each week teaching media students at the William S. Hutchings College and Career Academy how to make a podcast. Here in Macon-Bibb County, where only 25% of residents earn at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and just as many live in poverty, pre-professional programs like this one can provide a path to employment for students who might otherwise fall through the cracks.\n\nPoverty and crime isn't our only story\n\nMacon-Bibb County is unlike any other place I\u2019ve lived before. It\u2019s made up of a small city, along with a few suburbs, but overall just feels like a small town. With a population of about 150,000, it grapples with many of the same issues as my hometown of Baltimore: racial segregation, urban blight, socioeconomic inequality and government corruption, just to name a few. But at one-fourth of Baltimore\u2019s size, the issues feel magnified, never far from sight.\n\nReport for America: My print-only local newspaper won't chase Twitter likes, Google searches \u2014 just the story\n\nMacon is often in the news for its crime and poverty. I am struck by how many other stories go untold. Before my students graduate and enter the workforce, I wanted to provide them with an opportunity to tell those stories. Their stories.\n\nAs an outsider without a single connection to this community when I moved here last year, I've met with countless adults who helped me understand the inner workings of this small city I now call home. But my students have painted a different picture of this place, one that adults rarely talk about, at least not in explicit terms. One week, a student told the class that he struggles to balance his schoolwork and late-night shifts at Burger King. Another shared that he had been kicked out of his first elementary school when he was 6 years old for bringing his older brother\u2019s BB gun to school.\n\nJy\u2019Nivea Troutman presents her podcast to her class at the Williams S.

The local skating rink, where kids and teens used to congregate, closed in 2017. The nearby mall is virtually vacant, and most businesses have moved uptown to the wealthier suburbs.\n\nThey\u2019re frustrated with the schools\u2019 emphasis on standardized testing and the random backpack searches that feel like invasions of privacy. Some fell asleep during our weekly sessions or stare off into the distance during my lectures, and I couldn't help but wonder \u2014 and worry \u2014 what\u2019s keeping my students up at night.\n\nKids\u2019 and teens\u2019 voices are often left out of news reporting. Their names and ages appear in stories when they win an award or commit a crime, but we rarely get a full picture of who they are. The omission is partly a matter of logistics. Adults want to protect minors\u2019 privacy. Journalists don\u2019t want to overstep, or they don\u2019t know how to gain access into the inner world of the youth in their community. But their voices matter. It\u2019s on journalists like me to explain the reporting process to teens and give them a platform to share their insights and opinions.\n\nTeens share a new perspective\n\nUntil then, my former students are changing the narrative. They\u2019re reporting on topics the local newspaper probably wouldn\u2019t think to cover, like teen dating and post-graduation plans, and offering an adolescent perspective on topics we already write about, like business trends and mental health. They\u2019re exploring subjects that they care about, that they wouldn\u2019t normally be allowed to investigate for class.\n\nReport for America: Out here in New Mexico, life and death flow at the pace of the vulnerable Rio Grande\n\nAnd they\u2019re changing how I do my job.\n\nI\u2019m constantly thinking about how to get to know my sources as more than one-dimensional characters. I struggle to write about subjects like blight, homelessness and poverty that incorporate personal narratives without tokenizing the people I interview. My students served as an informal focus group for my reporting. When I was working on a story about food deserts, I talked to them about how the shuttering of a nearby Kroger had affected their families\u2019 ability to buy groceries. When I wrote a story about proposed legislation in the Georgia legislature to remove the sales tax from feminine hygiene products, I asked my students how they pay for their own pads and tampons.\n\nFor two hours a week, I could talk to my students about what it\u2019s like to be a teen in this town. As we listened to clips from different podcasts, we delved into discussions about racism, police-community relations, crime and food insecurity. My students shared childhood memories and complex theories about society and crude jokes I pretended not to hear.\n\nFor two hours a week, my students had a space to open up, to be themselves without judgment, to be heard. I worked hard to earn their trust and let them know I\u2019m listening. I hope you'll listen, too.\n\nSamantha Max is a Report for America corps member.
