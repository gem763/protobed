So well, in fact, that you can stream Xbox One games onto your PC.\n\nWhy would you want to do this? Perhaps because you prefer your monitor to your TV. Or maybe your Xbox One is on the other side of the house, and you just want to wirelessly stream to your PC instead of buying a 50-foot HDMI cable to physically link the two together.\n\nRelated How to use Xbox Game Pass on your Windows 10 PC\n\nThere is a catch: unlike PlayStation 4\u2019s Remote Play and PS Now, two features that let you stream from anywhere, the Xbox One console and PC need to be on the same network. Still, it\u2019s a pretty cool trick. There are only a few simple steps that you need to get through in order to get your console\u2019s feed sent to your PC.\n\nUse the Xbox Console Companion app\n\nIf you have a Windows 10 desktop or laptop, it likely already has the Xbox Console Companion app installed. (This was formerly known as the Xbox app; Microsoft is in the process of transforming it into a more fleshed-out gaming dashboard). You can download the app from the Microsoft Store if it\u2019s not already on your PC.\n\nOpen the app, then sign into your Microsoft account (which is also your Xbox account) when it prompts you to do so.\n\nOnce you\u2019re signed in, click the menu button at the top left-hand side of the Xbox Console Companion app window. It will open a list of items. Click \u201cConnection\u201d near the bottom of that list.\n\nClick \u201cAdd a device\u201d in the top-middle section of the app window. The app will search for an Xbox One console in your network. Click \u201cConnect\u201d once you find your console.\n\nIf your console doesn\u2019t show up, enter its IP address in the appropriate field. Your Xbox One\u2019s IP address can be found by opening up the settings menu on the console, then clicking \u201cNetwork\u201d > \u201cNetwork settings\u201d > \u201cAdvanced Settings.\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019re connected, your console will show up under the \u201cNow Playing\u201d section in the Xbox Console Companion app. Click it and your PC monitor will show a direct feed from your Xbox One.\n\nFix lag on a wireless network\n\nAs you play on your PC, there may be some lag depending on your Wi-Fi network speeds. One way to speed up a choppy stream is to use Ethernet instead, if that\u2019s an option. You can also use the Xbox Console Companion app to tweak the fidelity of the stream, resulting in a faster-moving picture, although at the expense of image quality.\n\nTo access the drop-down menu, hit the menu button on the top-right part of the display, near the full-screen button.\n\nIf you want to look at the granular details of the stream, like bit rate, bandwidth use, and more, click the button that appears near the bottom left part of the screen.\n\nI don\u2019t use the Xbox Console Companion app on my PC too often, but it comes in handy when I want to play Xbox at the same time that others prefer to watch something else on the TV. It\u2019s particularly useful for slow-paced games where the speed of your inputs doesn\u2019t come into play, but I found it to be sufficient for games like Asura\u2019s Wrath, which relies on quickly completing events to make progress.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Console Companion app is your key to playing Xbox One games on your Windows 10 desktop or laptop. Unlike PS4 Remote Play or PS Now, this app limits you to streaming on your local network, but it\u2019s still a fun trick.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91kzfzXtVCJeiAe0rbOxyF-YApM=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16309943/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-24"}
