My sheets need to be soft and durable. My comforter should be breathable. My sleepwear should be comfortable (and not just a band t-shirt).\n\nStars Above Striped Perfectly Cozy Lounge Jogger Pants, $20 at Target: My favorite piece of sleepwear is one of the softest things I own. After Target announced that they were launching three different lounge brands, I found myself in the store and couldn\u2019t help myself. The Stars Above Striped Perfectly Cozy Lounge Jogger Pants are probably the best apparel purchase I\u2019ve made this year. If you want all-over comfort, get the Perfectly Cozy Lounge Jumpsuit and never put real clothes on again.\n\nWashable Silk Tee Set, $198 at Lunya: Other brands like Lunya, with their smooth silk and beautiful design, take sleepwear seriously (and we reap the benefits). Their washable silk Tee Set is something that could be worn as regular clothing as well, which means you\u2019re basically buying two shirts for the price of one gorgeous, flowy silk tee. Bare and Eclipse are my favorite colors. And honestly, you can\u2019t go wrong with a silk robe or jumpsuit.\n\nLOVE Stories Billy PJ Bottoms, $117 at Shopbop: LOVE Stories is a brand that creates elegant pajamas with an edge. Whether it\u2019s the leopard print Cara Midi Slip or polka-dotted Billy PJ Bottoms, these are pieces you\u2019ll be counting the days to wear again while they\u2019re in the wash.\n\nMarina AtLeisure Shirt in Pine Velvet, $348 at Sleepy Jones: Sleepy Jones mixes masculine and feminine designs to create sleepwear you\u2019ll want to live in 24/7. The Marina AtLeisure Shirt in Pine Velvet is the perfect winter-time pajama while the breezy Silk Marina Pajama Pant is what you\u2019ll want to throw on when the weather starts to warm up. Also, this is one of the best tote bags I\u2019ve seen in a while.\n\nSKIN Jemma Voile-Trimmed Pima Cotton-Jersey Pajamas, $165 at Net-a-Porter: If you want the softness of silk but are more of a cotton person SKIN makes some durable, soft sleepwear that has elevated designs but made from Pima cotton. The Ribbed Jersey Travel Set has all the pieces you could want while away from home and Jemma Voile-Trimmed Pima Cotton-Jersey Pajamas takes inspiration from classic menswear styling.\n\nSleeper Blur on Coal PJ Set, $320 at ShopBop: Sleeper is an innovative sleepwear brand with the tagline: \u201cWorld's First Walking Sleepwear.\u201d Their linen maxi dresses took off last year, but they also make some sleek matching sets that you\u2019ll want to lounge in all day.\n\nSilk Tank and Pant Set in Emerald Floral, $198 at Helena Quinn: Helena Quinn makes some incredible floral pajamas that you could easily wear out and about. Pair the Silk Tank and Pant Set in Emerald Floral with a blazer and heels and you\u2019re good to go. Or chuck a coordinating robe on top and you\u2019re halfway to becoming Gillian Anderson\u2019s character in Sex Education.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
