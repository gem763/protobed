More than three-fourths of the population lives in poverty, even though nation sits on tremendous oil reserves.\n\nThe auction comes after the Geneva prosecutor\u2019s office announced in February it had closed a case against Teodoroin Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of the country\u2019s president, Teodoro Obiang, and two others who were being investigated for money laundering and mismanagement of public assets. Teodorin is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled the west African state for four decades. Rights groups have labeled his administration one the world\u2019s most corrupt, according to Reuters.\n\nTwenty-six Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, and Rolls-Royces owned by Teodorin, the vice president and former agriculture minister, were part of the lot sold at Bonmont golf and country club in the Swiss village of Cheserex, 19 miles from Geneva, on Sunday, according to Reuters.\n\nSwiss authorities seized the cars and ordered the sequestration of a yacht in 2016.\n\nThe yacht was released in the arrangement announced in February, under which Equatorial Guinea agreed to pay Geneva authorities 1.3 million Swiss francs \u201cnotably to cover procedural costs,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said.\n\nThe cars were available for inspection for two days prior to the auction.\n\nThe white 2014 Lamborghini Veneno Roadster, had the initials TNO painted on the hood and gull-wing doors, which fetched the top sale had been drawing interest since Friday. One of only nine made, it has 201 miles on the odometer, and was being inspected Friday by a potential German bidder kneeling in the grass.\n\n\u201cIt is the first time such a car is being offered at public auction,\u201d James Knight, Group Chairman of Bonhams Motoring Department who will conduct the auction, told Reuters before the auction. \u201cBuyers want a car to have had few owners, a service handbook and a low odometer reading.\u201d\n\nOther cars sold at the Domaine de Bonmmont golf club on the edge of Geneva included a yellow 2003 Ferrari Enzo for 3.1 million Swiss francs, and a 2015 Koenigsegg One:1 that fetched 4.6 million Swiss francs.\n\nAn armored 1998 Rolls-Royce Silver Spur limousine described as being \u201cperfect for someone with enemies sold for 86,250 Swiss francs.

Last year, Brazilian officials said $16 million in undeclared cash and luxury watches that were seized from a delegation he led may have been part of an effort to launder money embezzled from the country\u2019s government. And a Paris court in 2017 convicted the son of embezzling millions of dollars in public money, although the case has been appealed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Geneva prosecutor\u2019s office in February cited rules allowing prosecutors to close cases in which the person under investigation had \u201crepaired the damage or done everything that could have been expected of him or her to make up for the wrong that was caused.\u201d\n\nThe investigation involved authorities in the United States, the Cayman Islands, France, Monaco, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Marshall Islands.\n\nThis report contains material from the Associated Press and Reuters.", "description": "Over two dozen luxury cars, seized from Equatorial Guinea, netted tens of millions at auction on Sunday", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/teodoro-obiang-auction-Getty-003.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
