Still, despite their popularity, AirPods have lacked one major feature for listeners who want to block out external sounds while fully immersing themselves in the music.\n\nThat's \u201cActive Noise Cancellation,\u201d the key ingredient driving the long-rumored new AirPods Pro that finally hit Apple Stores on Wednesday. The $249 buds \u2013 yes, they\u2019re expensive \u2013 go on sale just as rival Amazon\u2019s new EchoBuds arrive, also with their own version of noise cancellation, but for $120 less.\n\nAccording to Apple, the noise cancellation inside AirPods Pro is accomplished through a pair of microphones \u2013 one outward-facing, the other inward \u2013 that are combined with advanced software. Apple says noise cancellation continuously adapts the sound signal 200 times per second.\n\nBut the new AirPods also have a feature called \u201cTransparency Mode,\u201d similar to the Ambient Mode feature on Samsung's $130 Galaxy Buds, which, for example, will let you hear the captain\u2019s greeting or some other announcement on an airplane at the same time you\u2019re listening to a song.\n\nYou can switch modes by apparently squeezing a force sensor along the stem that hangs down from your ear lobe. You can also use that sensor, Apple says, to skip tracks or answer and end phone calls. Siri can also handle such tasks, via a \u201cHey, Siri\u201d voice command.\n\nApple is claiming about five hours of listening time between charges, same as on existing models, or about a half-hour less if active noise cancellation is activated. The new models support wireless charging. And by charging them in their wireless charging case, Apple says you\u2019ll get more than 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time.\n\nFirst responder discount:T-Mobile offers discounts for firefighters, police, other first responders\n\nThe earbuds come with three different sizes of soft, flexible silicone ear tips to help provide a comfortable fit. We\u2019ll be putting a pair in our own ears to determine just how comfy that is, while also judging the most important consideration for would-be buyers, sound quality.\n\nFor those people who don\u2019t want to spend quite so much, Apple will still be selling AirPods with a conventional charging case for $159, and models with a wireless charging case for $199.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter", "description": "Apple's pricey new AirPods Pros bring noise cancellation and a transparency mode that lets you hear the world around you while you listen to music.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/28/USAT/d87bc99a-53cb-4c1f-96ff-89146cc6a3e2-Apple_AirPods-Pro_Lifestyle_102819.jpg?crop=6842,3849,x0,y348&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
