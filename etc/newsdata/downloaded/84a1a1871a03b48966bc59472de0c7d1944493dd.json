He had been taken off his medication due to other health complications, which may have caused him to lash out, said Dale Galipo, the French family attorney.\n\nSanchez, a seven-year veteran of the LAPD, fired 10 rounds at French. He struck French four times in the back and shoulder, his mother once in the stomach, and his father once in the back, Corona Police Chief George Johnstone said.\n\nSanchez's lawyers say it was self-defense.\n\n\"I believe that he believed at that moment that he was shot,\" Riverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin said in a news conference Wednesday upon making the announcement that there would be no charges.\n\n\"He told witnesses around very quickly after that he was shot and he was reaching back numerous times looking for blood on the back of his head. So that's the evidence. That's the evidence that the grand jury heard. And that's from numerous witnesses around the incident. Yes. The officer, after being struck, thought he had been shot and believed there was an active shooter in front of him.\"\n\nThe grand jury was presented with a poor-quality clip of surveillance video and testimony from several witnesses, some of whom had been subpoenaed.\n\n\"All the evidence was presented to the grand jury. So ask yourself this question. If we can't get 12 jurors to charge a case at a probable cause standard, how are we gonna get it beyond a reasonable doubt?\" Hestrin said.\n\nGalipo said he was \"disappointed but not surprised\" by the lack of charges and alluded to the preferential treatment given to a police officer.\n\nHestrin responded: \"I categorically reject the idea that this officer got special treatment. We handled it as an officer-involved shooting. And this is how we handle officer-involved shootings.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe French family filed a claim against Sanchez and the LAPD, and their lawyer says they have plans to file a federal lawsuit next month.\n\nThe LAPD is also conducting an administrative inquiry into whether Sanchez followed the department's policies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A federal grand jury Wednesday declined to bring charges against an off-duty Los Angeles police officer who fatally shot a mentally ill man during an incident at a Costco warehouse in Southern California in June.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
