Here's a primer. Video by Kirkland Crawford/DFP Wochit\n\nAs I got off an airplane Tuesday morning, a man leaned in and said, \u201cMonday night was the first time I let my 9-year-old son stay up and watch a Detroit Lions game.\u201d\n\nI cracked that he should treat his children better. He laughed. Some folks around us laughed. And then we sighed. We all sighed.\n\nIt felt like the whole state was sighing Tuesday, didn\u2019t it? When we weren\u2019t pounding on tables or screaming at replays?\n\nIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve never experienced a loss before. Are you kidding? Lions fans experience loss? Are a wine maker\u2019s fingers purple?\n\nBut Monday night was different. Monday night, two weeks after taking arguably the AFC\u2019s best team, Kansas City, to the final minutes, the Lions took arguably the NFC\u2019s best team, Green Bay, to the final minutes \u2014 and lost again, with the outcome determined by a blown call.\n\n\u201cIt was a long plane ride home,\u201d Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford admitted in our radio interview Tuesday. \u201c(But) \u2026 here\u2019s the deal. It\u2019s over now. We lost the game. We didn\u2019t make enough plays, truthfully, that\u2019s the gist of it.\n\n\u201cYeah, there were calls that went against us. But there were probably some calls that went against them, too.\u201d\n\nNot really. Not when it mattered. Not with the game in the balance. No, that\u2019s Detroit\u2019s specialty. The Packers did just enough to steal that win by a single point, and even their head coach, Matt LaFleur, in the victorious locker room, yelled, \u201cHey fellas, I don\u2019t know how the hell we pulled that off.\u201d\n\nLions Luck. That\u2019s how. Not \u201cSame Old Lions,\u201d because these are not the same old Lions, they\u2019re way more talented now.\n\nAnd not \u201cThe Curse of Bobby Layne,\u201d because that\u2019s as outdated as Nehru jackets.\n\n\u201cLions Luck.\u201d It has its own definition. If buzzard\u2019s luck means \u201ccan\u2019t kill nothing and nothing will die,\u201d then Lions Luck means, \u201ccan\u2019t put the other guys away early, can\u2019t stop something from putting us away late.\u201d\n\nTagged, then tagged again\n\nOn Monday, that \u201csomething\u201d included three bad calls by the officials \u2014 all in the fourth quarter! \u2014 two on third-down penalties that weren\u2019t penalties, and one on a no-call on a very clear penalty, pass interference on Green Bay for mugging Detroit\u2019s Marvin Jones.\n\nIf any of those whistles go the Lions' way \u2014 as they should have \u2014 they might not lose the game.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t. Trey Flowers, who had never before been called for \u201chands to the face,\u201d got tagged for it twice \u2014 at the worst times, third downs, allowing Aaron Rodgers and the Packers to continue scoring drives.\n\nNot only did Flowers object, but I thought ESPN commentator Booger McFarland was going to pop a blood vessel.\n\n\u201cWhere?\" he kept yelling, apoplectic. \u201cWhere? ... Wha\u2019?\u201d\n\nWe know, Booger. The answer is \u201cnowhere.\u201d\n\nLions Luck.\n\nNaturally, the NFL admitted Tuesday that the second call on Flowers was wrong. Gee. Thanks. Helps a lot. Do you even put postage on that apology?\n\nAt least the rest of the country is catching on. Did you see the headlines Tuesday morning? Or listen to the national sports shows? They were all screaming that the Lions got jobbed. They were even saying nice things about our franchise, like Detroit is a good team, and, it\u2019s a shame they had to lose that way.\n\nOf course, we used to talk like that, too, oh, maybe 40 years ago, when losing this way was still fairly novel. \u201cToo bad, we\u2019re a good team,\u201d we\u2019d say, keeping a stiff upper lip. \u201cIt\u2019s a darn shame we had to lose that way.\u201d\n\nThese days we just holler, \u201cOH NOT A-FREAKING-GAIN!$#$@!!\u201d\n\nAnd knock over a table.\n\nLions Luck.\n\nA three-day hangover\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t spend too much time thinking about it,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI\u2019ve basically moved on to Minnesota (this Sunday\u2019s opponent). \u2026 Whatever happened, happened. I\u2019m over it. It\u2019s a tough loss, obviously a chance to win it at certain points in the game. We didn\u2019t make enough plays to win it.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t argue with him there. The Lions did get flagged for 12 men on the field during a Green Bay field goal try, giving the Pack a first down which led to a touchdown. That\u2019s four points right there, and four points would have won this game.\n\nThen there\u2019s the dropped pass in the end zone by T.J. Hockenson. The Lions settled for a field goal instead. Four more points there.\n\nA rushing attack with the flair of a rhinoceros could have yielded some points with just a teaspoon\u2019s imagination.\n\nAnd Stafford was sacked on a couple third downs, which is always a little bit of everyone\u2019s fault on offense.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s pretty inexcusable that the Lions' defensive backs, who pride themselves on being a strength of this team, couldn\u2019t stop a receiver named Allen Lazard, who came off the practice squad this year. Allen Lazard? He sounds like a French existentialist.\n\nBut there we go faulting the home team, when it\u2019s much more fun to scream at the refs. And the refs deserve a piece of this debacle.\n\nThe problem is, the refs go on to some other game next week. And Lions fans are still here, hoping the weight of two close losses doesn\u2019t chew into the fiber of this year\u2019s team the way previous bad losses have devoured previous Lions squads.\n\nI asked Stafford if the team took any solace in hanging with the two elite teams, the Chiefs and the Packers, right to the bitter finish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s surprising to anyone in our locker room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be to people outside. But the last two games we played against the \u2018really good teams\u2019 in this league and we\u2019ve been right there. The disappointing thing is we haven\u2019t finished them. That\u2019s no fun.\u201d\n\nNo fun at all. It\u2019s like a three-day hangover. Like failing chemistry and having to take chemistry again \u2014 in summer school.\n\nIt\u2019s Lions Luck, and we can only hope it wears off before Sunday\u2019s game against Minnesota, or Detroit will remain in last place in the toughest division in football. That\u2019s why the players have stopped complaining about it now. Put away their screaming. Swallowed their anger.\n\nI asked Stafford if there was a lot of grousing on the plane ride home from Green Bay.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty quiet. \u2026 To be honest, I was laying down in the back trying to get some sleep.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll bet he didn\u2019t get any more than that 9-year-old boy. Welcome to the club, kid. Lions Luck. It\u2019ll keep you up all night.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.
