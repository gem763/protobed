Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Thursday unveiled his proposal to legalize marijuana nationwide at precisely 4:20 p.m. EST \u2014 an homage to what has been dubbed \u201cWeed Day.\u201d\n\nWhile Sanders has already unveiled his plan for criminal justice reform, he specifically tackles marijuana legalization in his latest plan, citing the disproportionate impact its criminalization has had on minority communities.\n\nSeveral Democrat presidential candidates have pledged to legalize marijuana, but Sanders\u2019 plan expedites the process via an executive order, which he promises within the first 100 days in office, citing a change in public support for such action after 11 states have legalized recreational marijuana.\n\n\u201cWhile Congress must aggressively move to end the war on drugs and undo its damage, as president Bernie will not wait for Congress to act,\u201d the plan states.\n\nIt continues:\n\nUnder this plan, not only will Bernie take executive action to legalize marijuana by removing it from the Controlled Substance Act, he will expunge past convictions of marijuana related offenses, and ensure that victims of the War on Drugs are not passed over by the burgeoning marijuana industry.\n\n\u201cToday, the government considers marijuana as dangerous as heroin,\u201d Sanders tweeted following his plan\u2019s release. \u201cThat\u2019s idiotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs president I will immediately issue an executive order to declassify marijuana as a controlled substance,\u201d he pledged:\n\nToo many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana. Today I am releasing my plan to: \u2705 Legalize marijuana with executive action\n\n\u2705 Expunge past marijuana convictions\n\n\u2705 Invest in communities most affected by the War on Drugs https://t.co/0xQSHn6F3U \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 24, 2019\n\nToday, the government considers marijuana as dangerous as heroin. That\u2019s idiotic. As president I will immediately issue an executive order to declassify marijuana as a controlled substance. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 24, 2019\n\nWhen we said four years ago that we needed to legalize marijuana, it was considered a \"radical\" idea. Today, 11 states plus DC have legalized it. Not so radical anymore. When we're in the White House we will do so nationwide. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 24, 2019\n\nSanders vows that his administration will \u201creview all marijuana convictions \u2026 for expungement and re-sentencing\u201d and expunge all past convictions using the California model. He also promises that the tax revenue generated by legalized marijuana will go directly toward communities \u201chit hardest by the War on Drugs.\u201d\n\nHe plans to use billions in generated revenue to create grant programs aimed to assist minority communities, including the creation of a $20 billion grant program \u201cwithin the Minority Business Development Agency to provide grants to entrepreneurs of color who continue to face discrimination in access to capital\u201d and another $10 billion grant program that would \u201cfocus on businesses that are at least 51% owned or controlled by those in disproportionately impacted areas or individuals who have been arrested for or convicted of marijuana offenses.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Sanders plans to give formerly incarcerated individuals access to free job training \u201cat trade schools and apprenticeship programs related to marijuana businesses.\u201d\n\nThe socialist senator\u2019s plan also addresses concerns over the \u201cBig Tobacco\u201d industry, which he ensures will not infiltrate the marijuana market.\n\n\u201cWe will provide resources for people to start cooperatives and collective nonprofits as marijuana businesses that will create jobs and economic growth in local communities,\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan states.", "description": "Sen.
