However, Jaypee was forced to delay the project and went into insolvency in 2017.\n\n\"The project has been stuck and there is no progress at all. Even the bankruptcy court has not been able to resolve the issue so far, it is just hanging in thin air,\" Mitroo said. He did not say how much money he had paid, but properties in that project range from about $56,000 to $140,000.\n\nSeveral such projects are stuck across the country and buyers are waiting for new developers to take interest and complete them with the hope that their hard-earned money, which has been stuck for years, won't be lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n\nBAD LOANS PILE 'HUGE'\n\nThe property sector has been battling a downturn for the last 3-4 years. Things have now, however, hit a critical point due to a liquidity crunch hitting shadow banks that are big lenders to both developers and property buyers.\n\nAs of June 30, 421 realtors were under the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP), up from 209 on Sept. 30 last year, data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India shows.\n\nDefaults by two housing finance companies, Dewan Housing Finance Corp and Altico Capital, have increased fears of contagion to the banking system. .\n\nDewan and Altico did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nShadow lenders will be highly exposed when loans worth roughly 700 billion rupees come up for repayment in the first half of 2020, as many builders may struggle to repay, Fitch's India Ratings said last month.\n\n\"The number of stressed assets in real estate are huge,\" said Rohit Poddar, managing director at Poddar Developers. \"The stress now is just the start, only the mid-sized to large developers will survive, others will die.\"\n\nIf three-quarters of the high-risk category of outstanding real estate loans is not repaid, that could lead to additional bad debt of $15 billion on banks' books in the next few years, according to confidential research conducted by one of India's leading real estate consultancies for an international financial client, and provided to Reuters.\n\nThe Nifty Bank index, which surged in late September after the government moved to slash corporate tax rates, gave up more than half those gains as of Friday. Concerns about real estate loans were one factor, according to analysts, but the fall was also driven by low growth in the economy and the overall worsening asset quality of certain lenders.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nupur Anand", "Swati Bhat"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
