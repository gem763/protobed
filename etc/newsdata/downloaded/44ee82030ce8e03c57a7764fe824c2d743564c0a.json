Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the nicest things that has been said about me for a long time. A non-cooperative crusty, absolutely superb \u2013 do they taste good? That\u2019s my thought, I think they do.\u201d\n\nHe defended his son\u2019s choice of words as an attempt to \u201cget the point across\u201d about being late for a book launch.\n\nJohnson appeared on a panel of political figures, including Siobhan Benita, the Liberal Democrat candidate for mayor, Skeena Rathor, a Labour councillor from Stroud, and Rupert Read, a Green party activist and Extinction Rebellion spokesman, addressing the question: \u201cCan traditional politics rise to the challenge of the climate and ecological emergency?\u201d\n\nMost of those speaking suggested the political system required major modifications to answer environmental problems. But Johnson suggested meaningful change could be achieved only through traditional party politics \u2013 with a little prodding from non-violent protest movements such as Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cCan you use the present system? Is it good? Well, I tell you it is good, because it\u2019s the only one we\u2019ve got and we have to use this system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut this is the point: what really influences politicians is the sense that out there in the streets, out there in the post offices, out there in the great wide world, there is a great mass of people who approve of what they want.\n\n\u201cI would say you have exactly the right things in mind here. I would say, for example, your target of bringing the net-zero carbon emission date down from 2050 to 2025 \u2013 fine, go for it; it is doable.\u201d\n\nJohnson suggested environmental protesters had Margaret Thatcher to thank for beginning moves to tackle pollution. He pointed out that historically, the UK had the second-highest cumulative emissions of any country, behind the US.\n\n\u201cSo we do have a responsibility here, we can deliver on that responsibility, and I do congratulate you all for coming. Don\u2019t get stuck with glue somewhere you don\u2019t want to get stuck. I don\u2019t promise to do anything illegal \u2026 I mean, I can\u2019t. Your force comes from the fact that you are wedded to peaceful protest and you are not going to break the law,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Johnson spoke, there were arrests nearby as police blocked a procession of nursing mothers from marching on Downing Street. Parents and their children had earlier gathered by the Queen Elizabeth II centre before marching. They staged a sit-down protest and \u201cmass nurse-in\u201d on Whitehall after being stopped from reaching their intended destination.\n\nLorna Greenwood, from Lewisham, south-east London, who helped orchestrate the protest, said: \u201cWe are bringing our babies to the heart of government to say these are the lives that are going to be most at risk from the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cBabies have already died all over the world, are dying and continue to die, and we\u2019re begging for their lives and futures.\u201d", "description": "Stanley Johnson tells London protesters they have \u2018exactly the right things in mind\u2019", "authors": ["Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd2b8d3e76ec1835cbad6f264619efc55a4f4dd/0_49_5028_3017/master/5028.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c135241153ed16500f63d5b067dc1b11", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
