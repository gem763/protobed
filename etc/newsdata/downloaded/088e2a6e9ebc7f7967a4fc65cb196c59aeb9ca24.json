This category of funds also offers solid protection against inflation. The real estate sector has recently seen tough times but the presence of this investment vehicle generally adds stability to a portfolio. Usually, volatility in property prices is far less than the extent experienced by stocks. Adding such funds to a widely diversified portfolio would increase returns, while significantly reducing the associated risk.\n\nThe Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE) has gained 27% year to date (YTD). The recent Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey, 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped 120 basis points over a year to an average rate of 3.73%. This is likely to propel gains for the space.\n\nSo, investing in real estate mutual funds seems prudent as of now. Let us look at two of the best funds from the space and find out which one is better for investment.\n\nDFA Global Real Estate Securities Portfolio (DFGEX)\n\nThe fund aims for long-term capital appreciation. It seeks to gain exposure to a wide portfolio of securities of U.S. and foreign companies in the real estate industry. It invests with a focus on real estate investment trusts or companies that the advisor evaluates as REIT-like. The fund may pursue its objective by investing in DFA Real Estate Securities Portfolio, DFA International Real Estate Securities Portfolio and in securities of companies operating in the real estate industry.\n\nThis Sector-Real Estate product has a history of positive total returns for over 10 years. Specifically, the fund\u2019s returns are 7.3% over the 3-year and 9% over the 5-year period.

DFGEX carries an expense ratio of 0.24% and requires a minimal initial investment of $0.\n\nFidelity Real Estate Income Fund (FRIFX)\n\nThe fund seeks higher-than-average income as well as appreciation of capital. It invests the lion\u2019s share of its assets in real estate companies as well as other real-estate-related investments. The fund also invests in preferred and common stocks of real estate investment trusts, debt securities of real estate entities as well as commercial and other mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThis Sector-Real Estate product has a history of positive total returns for over 10 years.
