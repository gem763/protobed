Noel had dropped off his daughter at school, but his son, a third-grader, was still in his car waiting to be taken to elementary school.\n\nUpper Darby Superintendent Daniel P. McGarry decried the teacher\u2019s remarks. He said he was \u201cappalled and speechless\u201d when he heard them and immediately asked to meet with Noel to apologize. The district placed Greeley on unpaid administrative leave.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not who we are,\u201d McGarry said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re a very diverse community and I take this very seriously. Hurtful, racist comments are not acceptable, period.\u201d\n\nIn an email sent to parents and teachers Monday night, McGarry said he believes Greeley should be fired.\n\n\u201cThere is a legal process we must follow, and the teacher does have due process rights. My recommendation to the Board is for termination,\u201d McGarry wrote. \u201cThe teacher may elect to resign, go to arbitration, or request a formal hearing in front of the Board of School Directors. We are following the legal process. I want to make it clear that we do not condone or support the comments or actions of the teacher in question.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNoel, a truck driver, said he dropped off his daughter at Drexel Hill Middle School and was leaving the parking lot when Greeley backed her pickup truck into his car. Noel said Greeley erupted when he asked her to exchange license and insurance information.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe started cursing and screaming at me,\u201d Noel, 32, said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019m not going to argue with you,\u2019 and I called the police to report the accident. Then I started filming for my own protection. I wanted police to see it.\u201d\n\nAttempts to reach Greeley and her representatives this week were unsuccessful. No one answered her home phone and emails sent to various addresses were not answered or were bounced back. The president of the teachers union that represents Greeley declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nIn the video, Greeley and Noel are about 20 feet apart in the mostly empty lot. When Greeley tells Noel he\u2019s probably on welfare, Noel responds, \u201cNot even a little bit. Six figures a year, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s because I\u2019m young and I\u2019m black is the reason you would say that.\u201d\n\nWhen Noel dismissively reiterates Greeley\u2019s \u201cprobably on welfare\u201d comment, she replies, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Always looking to milk the system. And you see me and I\u2019m white . . . and you think I got money.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the exchange continues, Noel tells Greeley she\u2019s \u201cmad and nervous, I understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo f--- off, n-----,\u201d Greeley replies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Noel asks.\n\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Greeley replies.\n\nNoel then tells Greeley \u201cthis situation can change real quick,\u201d and Greeley starts walking toward him. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou better stay over there is what I\u2019m going to tell you,\u201d Noel repeats twice. That\u2019s when the video ends.\n\nNoel said that when Greeley used a racist epithet, \u201cI was like, \u2018Did she really just say that?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe she said that.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Noel didn\u2019t know Greeley was a teacher at the school.\n\n\u201cThis is somebody who should not be teaching anything, anywhere to anybody. Especially not children,\u201d Noel said. He posted the video to Facebook, he said, to get the attention of parents and people in the area. \u201cIf your kid goes here, you need to know who\u2019s teaching your kids.\u201d\n\nMcGarry said his statements about the incident have garnered support from the community, but he has also received threats from throughout the country and has been called racist names for recommending Greeley be fired.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting threatening emails, but I\u2019m not going to be bullied,\u201d he said. \u201cEducating children is my job, and we educate them to not react in this way.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Video captures racist insults hurdled by a middle school teacher.", "authors": ["Joe Heim", "Reporter Covering A Range Of Topics", "Including Race", "Schools", "Student Culture", "White Nationalism", "Native American Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wPvewH2UCxkk0dGx84erhN2aCqM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ZIZUIVIHII6NOSZU7MTCZOG2Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
