It doesn\u2019t make you a bad feminist. Want to have sex all the time with loads of people? Go for it.\n\nIt features chapters on pubes, virginity, casual sex and more (Picture: Flo Perry)\n\nFlo\u2019s book is very much about you and she encourages readers to engage with the book; in one section, you are even asked to jot down your thoughts on paper.\n\n\u2018Feminism is very trendy these days and you see the word in the media a lot,\u2019 Flo tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018But a lot of the conversation around sex and feminism seems to be just about how sex is a source of trauma in women\u2019s lives, and I want us also to talk about how it can be a place of pure joy! \u2018I hope it gets more people talking about what they want from sex. I hope it shows people that sex doesn\u2019t have to be something shrouded in shame, and I hope the book challenges some of the myths that porn, our parents, and our media make us believe about sex.\u2019 The book is also about relationships and how to keep things spicy with your partner (Picture: Flo Perry) It also talks about body image and that \u2018you are always loveable\u2019 (Picture: Flo Perry) Flo is a self-defined sex-positive person and doesn\u2019t mince her words when it comes sex, but that\u2019s all part of her charm and it\u2019s very much relayed in the book. She\u2019s dedicated it to her former and future lovers, and opens the book up by sharing details about her own sexual identity: \u2018My qualifications include being an emotionally well-adjusted slag and being really good at drawing boobs,\u2019 it reads. \u2018I\u2019m extremely bisexual. I say extremely because I fancy nearly all humans over 5\u20198 and some short ones too.\u2019 So, what is the key behind having sex like a feminist? \u2018Having feminist sex is all about having the sex you want to be having rather than the sex you think you should be having,\u2019 the sex-positive author adds. \u2018And of course maximising pleasure for you in your sex life, whatever that might look like.\u2019 The dating chapter is Flo\u2019s personal favourite because it taught her a lot (Picture: Flo Perry) Flo says: \u2018The book covers lots of things including, body image and how accepting your body can lead to better sex. \u2018Desire in long-term relationships, how to maintain it and why it sometimes goes away. Consent, what does it really mean and how to make sure it\u2019s a feature of your sex life. \u2018Dating, how to enjoy it and should you send nudes or not (I think you probably should.) \u2018I love the chapter on dating, I was really learning the lessons as I wrote it, I think it\u2019s funny, and I think being single can be a great time in your life.\u2019 More: Sex What is 'sex brain'? Women of colour face inequality in contraception and colonisation is to blame Are home STI tests free and are they safe? If you don\u2019t like illustrations in books, you\u2019ll probably not be a fan of this one, but there\u2019s a reason Flo decided to step away from the traditional writing model. \u2018I love drawing and so being able to draw for my own book was a dream,\u2019 she says. \u2018I think adding illustrations and making it funny makes the messages in the book easier to absorb. It\u2019s got some pretty hard-hitting facts and ideas in there, and breaking them up with jokes and pictures of boobs just makes it a more enjoyable read I think. \u2018I want this book just to be a big permission slip for women to do whatever they want. To talk about sex more, and probably to wank more.\u2019 The book was released yesterday (3 October) and can be bought at Amazon.\n\nMORE: There\u2019s now a special spongy tool to soak up semen after sex\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: People tell us about the time they had sex with a colleague\n\nMORE: Eight illustrations that demonstrate there is no such thing as a \u2018normal\u2019 labia\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "We interview author Flo Perry about her new book which features illustrations on how to have sex like a feminist and what this really means.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_5580EXPORT-43f0_1570183743.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
