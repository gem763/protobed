In January 2018, Adweek reported that the agency had placed him on leave pending the results of an unspecified investigation; two days later, he was let go.\n\nThe reasons for Royer's firing have never been made public, and he had not commented directly on the circumstances that led to his termination until this event. At the time, Droga5 issued a statement that read, \"We are committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for all our employees.\"\n\nAdAge reported on the October 6 speech the following day. It was part of the LIAisons program, described as an opportunity for agency creatives age 30 and under to learn from top executives in their fields. The anonymous employee said that, though attendees received an agenda the week before the conference, he knew of none who were aware that Royer would be speaking.\n\nAn LIA Instagram post on the day of the event simply described it as \"guest speaker.\"\n\nDay 3 Schedule\u2060 \u2060 #LIAawards #CreatedForCreatives #CreativeLIAisons A post shared by London International Awards (@lia_awards) on Oct 6, 2019 at 9:45am PDT Oct 6, 2019 at 9:45am PDT\n\nA key part of the controversy stemmed from the fact that some attendees felt like they would be penalized for leaving the event. \"On day one, we were told that if we did not attend each and every session \u2014 making sure to sign in twice a day \u2014 that they would not reimburse us for airfare and would evict us from our hotel rooms,\" the source said.\n\nThe source said he was \"disturbed\" by the way the event was structured, with Royer's speech beginning directly after a presentation on empathy from journalist Lara Logan.\n\nOne attendee reported feeling manipulated because Royer followed a speech on empathy and because attendees feared punishment for walking out\n\n\"We were intentionally manipulated to be in the room to sit and hear this man,\" the source said. \"We were primed to know that there would be consequences if we left the room and we were primed to have empathy at the forefront of our minds based on Lara Logan's discussion.\"\n\nA second person who was present for Royer's speech described it as \"a little all over the place.\" This person said Royer's main message was that the ad industry overall needs to communicate \"face to face\" and demonstrate greater empathy.\n\nThe first source said, \"No one I have spoken with has argued against apologies, redemption, or forgiveness.\"\n\n\"What I and others in attendance are blown away by is that this conference and this man felt it was appropriate to hijack the time during this opportunity for such an out-of-touch and tone-deaf apology,\" he said.\n\nHe added that LIA founder and president Barbara Levy took the stage to tell attendees her intention was not to make them uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nLIA clarified its attendance policy\n\nThe event inspired contentious discussion on Fishbowl, a mostly-anonymous ad industry networking app. One user posted a picture of Royer at the LIA podium in front of an image of The New York Times article about his departure from Droga5.\n\nAn LIA representative jumped into the conversation to clarify the organization's attendance policy. The rep said the show funds the young creatives' travel fees \"to give back to the industry\" and that \"if an attendee does not show up because they are partying in Vegas or choose to sleep in then LIA will notify their [executive creative director]/agency as the program is not meant to be a free vacation.\"\n\nThe LIA rep went on to say in Fishbowl that the organization has never fined an agency for violating that policy and apologized \"if this was communicated incorrectly.\"\n\nRoyer did not return an email seeking comment. The LIA organization has not responded to multiple requests for comment.", "description": "Surprise appearance by executive fired from agency Droga5 last year led IPG network FCB to terminate its partnership with London International Awards.", "authors": ["Patrick Coffee"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c95a0138e4a48ca75020b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
