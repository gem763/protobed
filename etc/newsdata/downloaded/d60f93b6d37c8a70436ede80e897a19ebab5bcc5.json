BBC 17/25 9. Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit.

Rex Features 24/25 2. RuPaul's Drag Race (2009) The show that launched a thousand memes. RuPaul\u2019s incredible popularity is a testament to how widely the show reached out beyond the LGBT community and into the wider public, who have been duly educated about drag culture and the courage of those who take part. Getty Images 25/25 1. Will and Grace (1998) Will and Grace was the first time a sitcom put gay characters front and centre, and delighted audiences with its razor-sharp wit.
