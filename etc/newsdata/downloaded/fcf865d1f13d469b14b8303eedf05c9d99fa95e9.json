The European Social Innovation Competition (ESIC) seeks to tap into the talent and energy of business innovators to solve a range of social issues. UK-based Nesta is a global innovation foundation and a partner in ESIC. The director of its Centre for Challenge Prizes, Tris Dyson, told Business Planet it\u2019s important to look beyond government circles for inspiration:\n\nThese are really important social issues that affect all of us all over in our communities. And we can't just leave this up to governments to solve these problems\n\n\u201cThese are really important social issues that affect all of us all over in our communities. And we can\u2019t just leave this up to governments to solve these problems, it\u2019s people with great ideas, for new products and services, that can really help to make a difference.\u201d\n\nIn London, Business Planet went to visit an example of the kind of service Dyson highlights; the Bike Project, which recovers old or abandoned bicycles, restores them and gives them to refugees.\n\n\u201c\u2026I told them about Aleppo, about the war and also about the falafel because falafel in Syria is really good. I already made a lot of friends here but sometimes I miss my friends in Syria.\u201d \u2013 UNHCR Dream Diaries https://t.co/lHE4iMnwgA \u2014 The Bike Project (@The_BikeProject) 12 janvier 2018\n\nEuropean Social Innovation Competition The European Social Innovation Competition, organised by the European Commission across all European countries, is looking for new solutions to the problems affecting society.\n\nEvery year, a key issue is selected as the theme of the competition and three projects offering the best solutions win \u20ac50,000 prizes.\n\nApart from the financial prize, projects also benefit from business support, mentoring, networking and PR opportunities.\n\nEach year the competition looks back at the participants from the previous edition and awards the \u201cImpact Prize\u201d \u2013 a prize for a project that had the most significant, measurable impact on society since taking part in the competition.

Public transport is very expensive. And London is a big capital, you can\u2019t get around on foot. \u201c\n\nAt the end of the day of Business Planet\u2019s visit, the Bike Project team began their weekly distribution of bikes, complete with helmets and other safety equipment. The project\u2019s founder, Jem Stein, says their service goes far beyond handing out free bikes:\n\n\u201cWe have refurnished and donated over 3,000 bikes to refugees, we have also set up a women\u2019s project; we teach refugee women how to cycle, from scratch. And we sell better quality bikes that we get through a website,\u201d he says.\n\nSo far the project has created 10 jobs. It has been so successful efforts are now underway to run it in other cities in England. The initiative has won several awards, including the Impact Award at the latest edition of the European Social Innovation Competition, organised by the European Commission.\n\nThe contest is an important springboard for social innovators, says Tris Dyson: \u201cWe are looking for people with great ideas from anywhere in Europe, we are going to pick the 30 best people, best ideas, support them, and there are going to be three prizes of 50,000 euros.\n\n\u201cThe 2018 edition of the competition opens in the spring in Paris this year. We\u2019re looking for innovators across Europe to keep an eye on social media in order to know how to apply.\u201d\n\nThe key message is that entrepreneurs can put their drive, energy and creativity to use in ways that benefits society as a whole.", "description": "An inspiring European initiative is helping innovators put their skills to resolving some the big issues facing society", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/423045/1000x563_423045.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-12"}
