She hops on a vintage bicycle and pedals past the Eiffel Tower on her way to a cafe where she will sit and read Baudelaire with her fluffy white dog at her feet.\u201d\n\nOthers compared the flame motif to the logo of dating app Tinder and suggested the silhouette of Marianne brought to mind the retro hairstyle made popular by Jennifer Aniston in the American sitcom \u201cFriends\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe artist\u2019s muse, the poet\u2019s dream, and the girl your mother warned you about. She\u2019s fashionably late for everything. She\u2019ll make out with your husband at a party and then wonder why you\u2019re mad,\u201d said one Twitter user.\n\n\u201cI want to follow the French Olympic logo on Instagram,\u201d wrote another.\n\nParisians got their first glimpse of the new logo when it was unveiled at the French capital\u2019s famous Grand Rex cinema on Monday.\n\nburs-gle/qan", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The new 2024 Olympics logo is supposed to evoke French history but has instead earned ridicule online for its apparent resemblance to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
