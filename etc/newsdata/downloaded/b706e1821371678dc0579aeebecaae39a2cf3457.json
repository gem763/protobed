This violent, squalid, disease-ridden district was one of the worst slums the revolutionary German thinker encountered on his tour of Victorian England. Everything about the place, he wrote in 1844, \u201carouses horror and indignation\u201d.\n\n\n\nVisiting today, he might be tempted to use the same words, for very different reasons. On either side of the leafy park, which undulates over the graves of 40,000 Victorian paupers, the bulky concrete frames of new apartment blocks are beginning to rise. They will ultimately become 17- and 22-storey slabs that will in turn be dwarfed by a 41-storey tower, all surrounding the park with a glacial wall of \u201cultra-sleek urban homes\u201d. And not a single one affordable.\n\nThis is MeadowSide, a \u00a3200m development by the Far East Consortium, a Hong Kong developer registered in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. This site \u2013 once the gateway to medieval Manchester and depicted in the paintings of LS Lowry \u2013 is being ripped up to make way for 756 luxury homes, many already sold off-plan to investors in Hong Kong. Brochures in the marketing suite describe it as a place \u201cwhere glass meets grass and concrete meets conkers\u201d. It\u2019s also where the forces of international capital meet a city seemingly open to investment at any cost.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Where glass meets grass and concrete meets conkers\u2019 \u2026 how MeadowSide will look. Photograph: Placenorthwest.co.uk\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of my city being strip-mined,\u201d says Sam Wheeler, councillor for the Piccadilly ward, where the blocks are sprouting. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to trash the nature of the area, but you\u2019re doing it to address the housing crisis, maybe we could have a conversation. But these schemes aren\u2019t even providing the homes Manchester desperately needs.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to government figures, there are now almost 2,000 households living homeless in temporary accommodation in Manchester, a six-fold increase over the last five years. The city\u2019s homeless population is more than 4,000, the highest rate in northern England, and nearly 13,500 households are on the social housing waiting list. How many social homes were built last year? Just 28.\n\n\n\nYet Manchester is visibly booming. Cranes cluster across the skyline and the concrete liftshafts of future towers dot every corner. The city is even beginning to look drunk on its own success. Brash billboards herald the latest luxury lifestyle concepts: Moda Angel Gardens offers a rooftop sports pitch, cinema and \u201csky lounge\u201d, with every aspect of its residents\u2019 lives managed through an app.\n\nOxygen will have five-star hotel facilities and \u201cbreathtaking views of a rising global destination\u201d. The brassy Axis Tower, which looks as if the architect\u2019s screen crashed halfway through designing the facade, is \u201ca true epitome of exclusivity and architectural grandeur\u201d. Despite the council having a policy of 20% affordable housing in all new developments, none of these schemes provide any.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There aren\u2019t enough expensive homes in the city\u2019 \u2026 Ian Simpson in his Beetham Tower penthouse. Photograph: Fabio de Paolo/The Guardian\n\nAs the Guardian revealed last year, across the 61 big residential developments granted permission by Manchester\u2019s planning committee over the previous two years, not one of the 14,667 homes met the government\u2019s definition of affordable, being neither for social rent nor offered at 80% of the market rate. The flood of steroidal schemes that have been rubber-stamped in the lust for growth is now becoming very visible: this is the most radical physical transformation of any UK city for some time.\n\n\n\nAt the forefront is Deansgate Square, a quartet of enormous grey glass towers that will stand like a defensive battery against the estates of Hulme to the south of the centre. Rising to a whopping 64 storeys, the development is billed as \u201ca new level\u201d. Manchester City\u2019s star striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero has already snapped up a penthouse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taller than anything I imagined was going to happen here,\u201d says the project\u2019s architect, Ian Simpson. He sounds almost surprised at what he has been allowed to do, dwelling on the tallest of the Deansgate four. \u201cIt\u2019s the city\u2019s first proper skyscraper, at over 200 metres.\u201d On his desk is a model of the area around Great Jackson Street, showing where the Deansgate shafts will take their place \u2013 among a cluster of 25 other towers, the composition of which Simpson also planned. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mini Manhattan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to create a real skyline, which Manchester has never had.\u201d\n\nPosters have already appeared announcing the birth of \u201cManc-hattan\u201d. But the truth is we are a long way from that uplifting skyline. This is more like something you\u2019d see on the outer ring road of a third-tier Chinese city.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s starting to create a real skyline\u2019 \u2026 Simpson\u2019s model of Great Jackson Street, where the Deansgate shafts will be. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright/The Guardian\n\n\n\nThe flanks of the Deansgate towers now loom above Simpson\u2019s office, located in a converted warehouse. Simpson can\u2019t escape them at home either. He lives in a huge duplex \u2013 complete with its own olive grove \u2013 at the top of nearby Beetham Tower. Completed in 2006, Beetham is itself 47 storeys tall, making it, until last year, the city\u2019s tallest structure. \u201cLooking out at night,\u201d he says, \u201call I see is red aircraft warning lights.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like an irritant, but for Simpson this red panorama symbolises the realisation of his quest to make Manchester a mecca for high-rise, city-centre living. \u201cManchester\u2019s city core had about 400 people living in it when the IRA bomb went off in 1996,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s got about 35,000. I\u2019d like it to have 200,000, because the one thing the city needs is people. That drives everything else.\u201d\n\nSimpson says the centre \u201cused to be a ghetto for people who couldn\u2019t get out\u201d, but now it\u2019s a desirable place \u2013 and it needs the swanky flats to match. \u201cPart of the problem,\u201d he adds, \u201cis that there aren\u2019t enough expensive homes in the city.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimpson believes this influx of luxury flats should be welcomed, because it means that those who would otherwise be driving in from the affluent commuter suburbs \u2013 Altringham, Wilmslow, Didsbury \u2013 will now be able to live in the centre. The absence of affordable housing, he argues, is a consequence of financial viability. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to build a tall building cost-effectively. None of these developers really make super profits in Manchester. It\u2019s not at all like London.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trinity Islands, acquired by Renaker, which has permission to build the tallest residential tower in western Europe. Photograph: Allied London\n\nRenaker, the developer-builder behind Deansgate Square and a large number of towers nearby, seems to be doing quite well out of it. In its most recent financial results, the firm reported a turnover of \u00a3132.8m, up 37% on the previous year, with pre-tax profits of \u00a34.6m. Last year, it acquired the prominent Trinity Islands site, which has permission to build the tallest residential tower in western Europe. Global real estate group CBRE puts the average residential yield in Manchester at 5.8%, compared with 3% in London. As one industry source puts it: \u201cThe returns are higher in Manchester \u2013 that\u2019s why all the money moved here.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr Jonathan Silver, an urban academic, began investigating the building boom when he returned to Manchester after a few years away \u2013 and found a homeless camp on Oxford Road, near where the first towers were sprouting.\n\n\u201cIt was a very powerful juxtaposition that reminded me of cities I\u2019d been researching in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything had changed. Until 2013, Manchester\u2019s development model was quite provincial: local developers using national banks, building the schemes and selling them to individual buyers. Now it\u2019s a tool the city is using to reinsert itself into the world economy, courting investment from China to Abu Dhabi.\u201d He says that, since the 90s, Manchester\u2019s mantra has been: \u201cAny investment is good investment.\u201d But times have changed, he warns, and the council needs to wake up.\n\n\n\nSam Wheeler agrees. \u201cThere was this desperation to reverse the post-industrial decline and transform the city centre at any cost. And they did it. People have come. It\u2019s worked. But we\u2019re in a different situation now. The population isn\u2019t declining and developers aren\u2019t going to run a mile if we insist they contribute to some social housing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Controversial \u2026 CGI showing St Michael\u2019s tower, fronted by Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, and the historic monuments it will loom over. Photograph: Stephen Hodder\n\nRichard Leese, leader of Manchester city council since 1996 and much credited with turning the city around, insists the council is tough on developers. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ve been getting the best deal we could for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cOur planning officers have access to robust assessment methods, but it\u2019s still hard to make these schemes stack up financially.\u201d He says it comes down to a choice: \u201cWe either swallow green belt, or we build densely on brownfield sites. I don\u2019t think the towers are too tall. In 20 years, people will be saying, \u2018Why did you build them so small?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen St Michael\u2019s tower \u2013 the controversial project fronted by the former footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs for tycoon Peter Lim who made his fortune in palm oil \u2013 is finally looming over the Grade I-listed town hall, it\u2019s hard to imagine many will wish the 40-storey skyscraper had been even bigger. Leese\u2019s argument seems disingenuous: saying no to these silos does not mean tearing up green fields around the city instead. It is perfectly possible to build mixed-tenure communities at high density on brownfield sites in a manner that fits the rest of the city. It just requires a little more effort and a decent plan \u2013 not the current approach of filling each site to its limits and pushing for the maximum height until it hits the airport flight path.\n\n\u201cThe situation is truly shameful,\u201d says Dr Margaret Collier of the Manchester Civic Society, which crowdfunded a campaign to challenge St Michael\u2019s tower decision. \u201cThe planning system is not fit for purpose, and authorities aren\u2019t looking with sufficient scrutiny at what\u2019s in front of them. We\u2019ve got a wonderful historic core in Manchester. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that it has turned out to be impossible to protect it.\u201d\n\nIf the barman, cleaner or nurse can\u2019t get a home, it\u2019s not their city\n\nIt seems no corner of the city is safe. In the bohemian Northern Quarter, a proposal for an angular glass stump \u2013 which was rejected three times by councillors for being too tall \u2013 was recently approved, despite the latest vision being the biggest yet. Dubbed the \u201cShudehill Shard\u201d and backed by Betfred billionaire Fred Done, the project will see a 17-storey glass wedge arrive in the colourful low-rise district, once again providing no affordable housing, despite being on a council-owned site.\n\nAs Wheeler asked at the time: \u201cDoes [the council] flog off some of the last, democratically controlled land in the city centre for a billionaire\u2019s vanity project, or does it listen to local people and their representatives, and use its power to make developers act with some responsibility?\u201d It chose the former.\n\nThere are signs, however, that Mancunians\u2019 vocal criticisms are beginning to have an impact. The first tower to include on-site affordable housing was secured earlier this year, in the form of the 30-storey Swan House, although it will still be only 5% of the total number of flats. Meanwhile, the council has started to make viability assessments public, and has introduced a \u201cclawback mechanism\u201d, for when developments turn out to be more profitable than expected. The council must have the confidence to insist on truly inclusive developments, with a higher calibre of design that respects the city\u2019s fabric, otherwise the lifeblood of Manchester, the fuel in the powerhouse\u2019s engine, will drain away.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the barman, cleaner or nurse can\u2019t get a home,\u201d says Wheeler, \u201cit\u2019s not their city. The people who make the city function need to be able to live here. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly radical thing to ask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2022 Oliver Wainwright will debate these issues at Sin City?
