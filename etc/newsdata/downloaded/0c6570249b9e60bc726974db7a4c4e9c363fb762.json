The Trump administration has continued to pursue an investigation into her tenure as secretary of state and presidential campaign, stepping up its efforts as the 2020 election approaches \u2014 contacting Clinton\u2019s former aides and up to 130 current and former State Department officials, the Washington Post recently reported.\n\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Democrats charge the president unlawfully attempted to pressure a foreign country to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nBiden\u2019s frontrunner status among Democratic candidates is currently being challenged by Senator Warren, who has taken the lead in national primary polls, while the former vice president has come under attack by Trump in light of his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nTrump previously lashed out at the impeachment inquiry, which picked up pace last week amid news of a second whistleblower and congressional subpoenas, and referred to Clinton, arguing she \u201ccan delete and acid wash 33,000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress, but I can\u2019t make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine? Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Clinton has stepped up her criticism of Trump amid the Ukraine scandal, repeating her belief that foreign interference affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller established that Russian agents were behind some of the cyberattacks against Democrats in 2016 and attempted to sway the election to Trump, although it reached no conclusion on whether that effort determined the outcome.\n\n\u201cI do think that he knows that he's an illegitimate president,\u201d she said during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d last Wednesday. \u201cAnd because of that, he's very insecure about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook what he's trying to do now,\u201d she continued. \u201cPart of the Ukraine scandal that is slowly coming to light is he's trying to figure out how to say, no, no, it wasn't the Russians even though our intelligence community and everyone who has looked at this said yeah, it was the Russians. He's trying to say no, somehow it was Obama, Hillary, whoever. So he's obsessed with the fact that he was helped a lot in unprecedented ways.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Responding to President Trump\u2019s sarcastic suggestion that Hillary Clinton should run for president again in 2020, Clinton tweeted back: \"Don\u2019t tempt me.
