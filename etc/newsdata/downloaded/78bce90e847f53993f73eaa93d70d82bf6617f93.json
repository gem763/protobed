Beckham drew safety attention from the Ravens, allowing Jarvis Landry to run wild with 167 receiving yards as Cleveland got on track with a win over a division rival.\n\nOn Monday, Beckham again caught two passes, this time for 27 yards in a 31-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAll most certainly was not well. The Browns dropped to 2-3 with the ugly loss and were exposed as a considerably lesser team than the one that entered the season with a tremendous amount of hype.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nAnd the most talented player on the team barely touched the ball for a second straight week. Even when things were bad with the New York Giants \u2014 and things got bad \u2014 Beckham was still getting touches.\n\nBeckham \u2018frustrated\u2019\n\nLosing and not getting touches amounts to an untenable situation. Beckham said as much at Browns practice on Thursday, though in a measured tone.\n\n#Browns Odell Beckham Jr admits he gets frustrated when he can\u2019t contribute in a loss pic.twitter.com/wAUMGagPAX \u2014 Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) October 10, 2019\n\n\u201cAnytime we lose, and I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to help win the game, I\u2019m gonna be frustrated,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the bottom line. I'm a winner in my heart, and I hate losing.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t blame OBJ\n\nStory continues\n\nBeckham isn\u2019t the problem in Cleveland. He\u2019s still the other-worldly talent who became a star in New York. Cleveland.com\u2019s Mary Kay Cabot points out that Beckham had only one game in 59 with the Giants where he didn\u2019t catch more than two passes. Now he\u2019s done so on two consecutive outings in Cleveland.\n\nNo, the problem in Cleveland can be laid squarely on head coach Freddie Kitchens and quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\nKitchens recognizes problem, won\u2019t fix it\n\nKitchens admitted after a Week 3 loss to the Los Angeles Rams that play-calling issues were \u201cmy fault.\u201d The rookie head coach also refused to hand them off to offensive coordinator Todd Monken.\n\n\u201cNot going to happen,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cIt's me. It's my fault. Todd does a great job. Todd does a great job during the course of the week of making sure we stay on task. We stay organized and all that kind of stuff. But when things mess up it's going to be me.\u201d\n\nOK. So it\u2019s on Kitchens. A coach who all but admits he\u2019s out of his depth when everybody watching the team agrees with him and then does nothing to inspire change can be described only as stubborn.\n\nStubborn Kitchens has added up to four catches for 47 yards for Beckham and one embarrassing prime-time loss over the course of two games.\n\nThere's no excuse for Odell Beckham Jr. tallying four catches over two games. It's on Freddie Kitchens and Baker Mayfield to fix things. (Getty)\n\nJarvis Landry calls out play-calling\n\nLandry, a long-time friend of Beckham\u2019s from their days together at LSU, all but called out Kitchens by name Thursday for not doing enough to get Beckham the ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling plays or designing anything,\u2019\u2019 Landry said Thursday, per Cleveland.com. \u201cBut at the end of the day, obviously he\u2019s a key part of our offense whether the ball\u2019s in his hands or not. The way that it\u2019s been going, we haven\u2019t really been making enough plays without him touching the ball.\u201d\n\nMayfield deserves blame too\n\nOf course Mayfield is not without blame. The second-year quarterback has taken a significant step back this season after a rookie year that left him all but christened as the long-awaited answer in Cleveland under center.\n\nThrough five games, Mayfield has completed 55.9 percent of his passes while throwing eight interceptions and four touchdowns. That\u2019s not a sophomore slump. Those are numbers that will get a quarterback benched over the long run.\n\nMayfield has struggled behind an offensive line that didn\u2019t get the same personnel upgrades Cleveland\u2019s skill positions have the past two offseasons and has drawn criticism for improvising and not sticking to his progressions when under pressure.\n\nLandry had insight on that front as well Thursday, again without naming names.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, as a receiver a lot of our success doesn\u2019t come solely from us,\u201d Landry said. \u201cA lot comes from being able to protect the quarterback, being able to get the snap, being able to drop back and read it. So you just can\u2019t pinpoint one thing whether it\u2019s the calls or the progression. We need to find a way to get better at it.\u201d\n\nMayfield addressed the subject as well on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt's frustrating when teams take him out of the game, but it's also an opportunity for other guys to make plays,\" Mayfield told reporters. \"We have to do our job of getting him the ball as many times as we can. He is a game-changer. That's why he's here. He's one of the best in the league. ... And if there are one-on-ones, we have to be able to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s time to fix things\n\nAll isn\u2019t lost in Cleveland. A 2-3 start isn\u2019t the end of the season. But there are serious glaring problems that need to be addressed.\n\nA good start this Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks would be a concerted effort to get the ball to Beckham.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "There's no excuse for Odell Beckham Jr. tallying four catches over two games.
