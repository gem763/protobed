Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA\n\nO\u2019Brien showed \u201cpitiless savagery\u201d, the Old Bailey heard, after he slashed Hanson with a knife, leaving him with a 37cm wound from his left ear to right chest, as his girlfriend and horrified revellers looked on.\n\nCCTV showed O\u2019Brien hiding a Stanley knife behind his back as he confronted his victim, then inflicting the catastrophic injuries. He strolled out of the bar calmly and fled London, sparking an immediate police manhunt. The next evening O\u2019Brien went for a night on the town.\n\nDCI Noel McHugh, who led the hunt for O\u2019Brien, said the CCTV his team recovered showed O\u2019Brien\u2019s callousness, revealing he had gone shopping to try on designer clothes shortly after the murder.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw was astounding. You would never know this man had just killed another in cold blood,\u201d said McHugh.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Brien was seen casually enjoying a curry with a friend, posing in front of a mirror, even getting the leftovers in a bag to go and then spending a couple of hours at Ashford Designer Outlet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think a man in his position might quickly grab the first thing on the shelf and make off, but no, as CCTV shows, he carefully selected and tried on trousers and shirts, even asking a shop assistant for help with collar sizing at one point. Always paying in cash \u2013 he was careful about that!\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien paid for a private four-seater plane from Biggin Hill airport in south-east London, where he was able to fly out of the United Kingdom without a passport.\n\nMcHugh said: \u201cThe fact he is a man who can arrange at the drop of a hat for a privately hired plane to whisk him away without a passport speaks volumes about his connections and criminal links.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien, who was unemployed and had no bank account, is believed to have been involved in the drug trade. McHugh said: \u201cThe man who chartered the plane and accompanied O\u2019Brien out of the UK was later convicted of importing 100kg of heroin and cocaine, along with 30 of those encrypted phones. The pilots were convicted in the Netherlands of importing more than 90kg of heroin. O\u2019Brien had some interesting friends.\n\n\u201cIt was a theme throughout the investigation: O\u2019Brien\u2019s ability to travel on false documentation and undetected through countries, using private planes and highly encrypted phones costing \u00a33,000 apiece.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien spent more than three years in Europe avoiding capture, and earned the title of one of the most wanted men in the world. His criminal connections got him false documents but in 2017 he got into a scuffle in Prague and was arrested. However, police there did not know who he was as he was using an alias and O\u2019Brien fled after being bailed.\n\nIn March 2019 O\u2019Brien was arrested in Romania and extradited to the UK on a European arrest warrant.\n\nAt the Old Bailey on Tuesday the jury took just 55 minutes to reject as lies O\u2019Brien\u2019s defence that his victim had provoked him and he had only meant to scare Hanson after the two men came across each other in the bar in Hillingdon.\n\nJosh\u2019s mother, Tracey Hanson, said after the conviction: \u201cThe aftermath of Josh\u2019s murder has left us broken beyond repair as Josh was taken from us in the most horrific way possible, suddenly, abruptly, viciously and violently, and nothing will ever erase the CCTV footage of Josh\u2019s final moments from our minds as he was struck with a knife so horrifically and callously, along with his suffering as he tried to fight for his life.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien will be sentenced on 17 October and faces a mandatory life sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Shane O\u2019Brien fled overseas after he slashed innocent man in west London bar in 2015", "authors": ["Vikram Dodd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8162b019d49c0c5699394deb134c687ad8faab0/0_477_1340_803/master/1340.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2a4c358dbace3876d3104e8a8397700", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
