Photo: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images\n\nPusha T didn\u2019t realize how much he\u2019d missed talking music with No Malice \u2014 let alone rapping together \u2014 until they were in the studio, working on the closer for Kanye\u2019s new album, Jesus Is King. Five years after No Malice promised that Clipse would never reunite, Kanye got the brothers \u2014 a decade after their last album, Til The Casket Drops \u2014 rapping together again. Over the phone with Vulture one recent afternoon, Pusha T discussed the reunion, and what it felt like to be back in the studio with his brother. \u201cAwwww man,\u201d he says, letting out a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m the younger brother, man. I mean, I\u2019m happier than \u2014 I can\u2019t even express it!\u201d The brothers talk every day, but working together again as Clipse wasn\u2019t something Pusha thought would ever happen, after years of No Malice turning down lucrative gigs. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for him, but I do think a lot of it had to do with feeling like he should be more present in everything that I had going on musically in the past couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like having a true warrior by your side.\u201d\n\nJesus Is King finds Kanye mining God and religion to piece together Kanye\u2019s own gospel, a Christian rap album totally without swears. Clipse and Kenny G feature on the penultimate track titled \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d (it was previously the closer on this ever-changing track list). Kanye was the one to request the Clipse feature, but Push wasn\u2019t sure No Malice would say yes. \u201cThe whole theme of the Jesus Is King album totally speaks to where my brother is,\u201d Pusha T said. \u201cHim and Kanye definitely bonded, probably way more than me and Ye bonded in the creation of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s saying that\u2019s the only one [album] that No Malice would rap on. It was just beautiful. They were out here [in Wyoming] working on the album just five months ago,\u201d Kanye recalled to Zane Lowe in a prerecorded interview that aired on Thursday. \u201cI remember sayin\u2019 I wasn\u2019t even gonna rap. I didn\u2019t know how to rap for God. So I remember No Malice being like, \u201cI\u2019ma write you a rap for this. You gon\u2019 rap on this.\u201d He continued, \u201cThis is such a win for the kingdom.\u201d\n\nOnce the brothers got into the studio, Pusha T said, he\u2019d found something he\u2019d forgotten he missed: There\u2019s a shorthand between family that makes it impossible to mince words in the way another collaborator might. \u201cI\u2019m laying down verses, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Ah, that probably could be better. You could say that better.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019 Or, \u2018It sounds cooler this way or that way. It\u2019s too many words in that line!\u2019\u201d Push said. \u201cJust having that scrutiny [is important]. It\u2019s a scrutiny that he doesn\u2019t hesitate with, because he\u2019s my older brother.\u201d Other people say he raps on \u201csome rap titan-level,\u201d Pusha says, making it hard to get feedback. \u201cIt\u2019s good to speak criticism at all levels so that we get out the finished project,\u201d he said. And what does he think their fans will make of the reunion he himself thought would never happen? \u201cWhen people hear the album and hear us on the album, they\u2019re gonna 100 percent know that this was an Olympic-level festival in the studio.\u201d", "description": "Pusha T on reuniting Clipse with his brother, No Malice, for Kanye West\u2019s \u2018Jesus Is King\u2019 and the role religion in the reunion.", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-clipse-interview.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
