REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis/File Photo\n\nGrowth will pick up to at least 2.8% next year from 2% in 2019, according to a draft budget submitted to parliament by the conservative government on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe draft budget ... signals the economic policy\u2019s radical turn to growth, employment and income increases,\u201d Deputy Finance Minister Thodoros Skylakakis said in an accompanying statement.\n\nUnemployment is forecast to drop to 15.6% next year from 17.4% in 2019, while Athens projects public debt will fall to 167.8% of GDP, or 331 billion euros, in 2020 from an expected 173.3% of GDP this year.\n\nGreece\u2019s national debt and its jobless rate are the highest in the euro zone.\n\nThe country emerged from its third international bailout last year and fiscal progress is still being monitored by its euro zone lenders, who project that the economy will grow by 2.2% in 2020 \u2014 much less than in the draft budget.\n\nGreece has promised to deliver a primary budget surplus \u2014 which excludes debt servicing costs \u2014 of 3.5 percent of GDP in each year up to 2022. Athens projects a primary surplus of 3.56% of GDP next year, based on its draft 2020 budget.\n\nAs well as broadening the tax base, the conservative government wants to cut taxes for businesses and increase social spending next year. The policies it plans are worth 1.2 billion euros, the budget said, and will help spur growth.\n\nThose plans are feasible as long as Athens \u201cimproves tax efficiency and reins in public spending as it has promised\u201d, said economist Nikos Magginas at National Bank.\n\nIf the planned measures are fully implemented, economic activity would accelerate, helping to bridge the gap with the European Commission\u2019s growth projection of 2.2%.\n\nThe government, which came to power in July, has said it wants agreement from official lenders on lowering the 3.5% of GDP budget surplus target in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAthens has outperformed its fiscal targets in recent years, with the former leftist-led government finding fiscal space to distribute the extra funds to those hit hardest by the crisis.\n\n\u201cLowering any overperformance (on the primary surplus) is a first step in our effort to reduce the targets themselves, a condition for the acceleration of economic growth,\u201d the draft budget said.\n\nGreece has built up a cash buffer of more than 30 billion euros from unused loans and money raised from markets. It is now relying solely on bond markets to refinance its debt after years in which it was unable to borrow commercially, having completed three bond sales since emerging from its bailouts last year.\n\nAccording to the draft budget, Athens plans to \u201censure its continuous presence in international bond markets\u201d through high-liquidity bond issues.\n\nFor FACTBOX on key economic targets in Greece\u2019s 2020 draft budget, click on [L5N26R09Q]", "description": "Greece hopes higher investment and tax cuts will help power economic growth next year as the country recovers from a decade-long debt crisis.", "authors": ["Lefteris Papadimas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438035469&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960NV", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
