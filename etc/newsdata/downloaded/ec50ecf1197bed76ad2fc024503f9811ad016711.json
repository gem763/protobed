I went in there straight, and so did the other guy, Lofty, who was a bit of a loveable bozo in the early days.\n\n\u2018Anyway, they suddenly decided that he weren\u2019t gay, they were gonna make him gay, and I didn\u2019t think that was a good idea as it would\u2019ve changed Nick\u2019s character completely, really. So I went to the producer, I said, \u201cI hear you\u2019ve got this idea, but I don\u2019t think it will work,\u201d and she said, \u201cWell, write him out,\u201d and I walked away. She was really harsh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But, I went back. I was just written out for that period. If I\u2019d have gone in playing a gay character, fine. But to suddenly make the character \u2026 I dunno, to me, as an actor, it would\u2019ve been wrong. I don\u2019t think the public would\u2019ve wanted it either.\u2019\n\nNick was central to some of EastEnders\u2019 darkest storylines, including the murder of Eddie Royle, several schemes to murder his own mum Dot (June Brown), accidentally causing the death of his son Ashley and holding the customers of the cafe hostage.\n\nHe was eventually killed off for good 2015, ironically at the hands of Dot, the ma he tried and failed to finish off so many times.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "He wasn't happy with the storyline.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nick-Cotton-011-2177_1572259084.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
