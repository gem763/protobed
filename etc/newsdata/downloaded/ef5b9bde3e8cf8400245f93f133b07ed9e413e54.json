But this week, President Trump decided it was not worth keeping 100 or fewer U.S. troops in northern Syria to deter a Turkish attack on America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Rand Paul loudly cheered him on.\n\nOn Wednesday, I noted Paul\u2019s 2015 comments about promising the Kurds their own country on the Corner, and on Thursday Senator Paul responded with a statement emailed by his communications director. \u201cI did and still do support a homeland for the Kurds \u2014 in Iraq \u2014 anyone who conflates the Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran into one simple homogenous, easily solvable problem is either naive or disingenuous,\u201d Paul said in the statement.\n\nFor the record, I never conflated the Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran \u201cinto one simple homogenous, easily solvable problem.\u201d My post simply pointed out that Paul had gone from promising to reward the Kurds who would fight ISIS with their own country to cheering on a decision to merely move \u2014 but not bring home \u2014 100 or fewer U.S. troops in order to enable Turkey\u2019s plan to slaughter America\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nSenator Paul still supports a Kurdish homeland in Iraq, he says. But many of the Kurds who fought the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria live in Syria, not just Iraq. What do we owe them?\n\nDid we owe them better than abruptly pulling out 100 troops whose presence kept Turkey at bay? Does it really stand to reason that just because Turkey is a member of NATO we needed to do them a solid and abandon our battlefield allies who suffered more than 10,000 deaths in recent years in a war against one of America\u2019s worst enemies?\n\nWon\u2019t abandoning the Kurds make it more difficult for America to recruit allies in the future to fight our enemies, undermining a key objective of interventionists and non-interventionists alike? Wouldn\u2019t fulfilling Paul\u2019s promise to help stand up a Kurdish country involve a much greater American commitment than keeping 100 U.S. troops in northern Syria?", "description": "He has responded to my Corner post.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Rich Lowry", "Zachary Evans", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kyle Smith", "Read More", "The American Conservative"], "top_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
