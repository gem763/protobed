(AP) - Buoyed by the presence of two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O'Neill, about 50 workers and supporters of horse racing rallied outside Santa Anita's main entrance Saturday.\n\nThey toted signs expressing their love of horses and support for the jobs and lifestyle the industry provides in California. Passing motorists on busy Huntington Drive honked and waved in support.\n\nProtesters have trod the same ground in recent months to criticize the deaths of 32 horses at the track since December and urge that the sport be abolished. However, none of them was among the pro-racing crowd at the rally, where a five-piece band played and O'Neill delivered tacos for lunch.\n\n\"Just want to be a voice of how proud we are of our horses and our jobs and our lives,\" said O'Neill, who trained Kentucky Derby winners I'll Have Another in 2012 and Nyquist in 2016. \"Trainers, grooms, hotwalkers, exercise riders, we've chose this as our career. It's very important to keep our voice very much alive and at the forefront.\"\n\nO'Neill said he expects more such rallies or as he called them \"celebrations.\"\n\n\"There's so many workers both frontside and backside that just feel paralyzed,\" he said. \"Having these kind of celebrations where we can all talk together and be with each other and really show that we are truly the backbone of the business, this is the reality, the love, the passion.\"\n\nKentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O'Neill, center, holds a sign during a rally in support of horse racing and its workers outside the main gate at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Calif on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019.

We got hardworking people that have chosen to care for horses for their livelihood and we're getting hit over the head. It doesn't add up to me.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "ARCADIA, Calif.
