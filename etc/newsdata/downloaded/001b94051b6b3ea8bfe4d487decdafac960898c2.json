In the spot, devoted dad Sam Worthington takes his wife Lily Rabe and their injured daughter to an out-of-town hospital, only to have all record of them completely disappear hours later. This is America, so you\u2019d think at least one person in that ER would be there long enough to bare witness, but if not, the way to solve this mystery is clear: call Jodie Foster and do what she did in Flightplan!
