Once your kids are old enough to do a few simple chores around the house, they\u2019re old enough to earn a little money doing them.\n\nIn my mind, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with putting kids who are three or four on a basic commission system. If they do the jobs you assign them, they get paid. If they don\u2019t do the jobs, they don\u2019t get paid. We put a little dry-erase board on the refrigerator, and listed the jobs they had to do during the week with a dollar amount next to each one.\n\nKeep in mind, kids shouldn\u2019t get paid for every little thing they do around the house. Some jobs are just a necessary component of being part of a family. And there are some things kids should do simply because mom or dad asked them to. Some jobs should have a higher purpose in mind, too, because as a parent, you should want to find as many teachable moments for your kids as possible.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve earned their money, sit down with them and divide it into three separate envelopes\u2014saving, spending, and giving. That way, they get to learn about the uses for money while they\u2019re learning how to work!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,Is it okay to give very young children an .10/30/2019 12:02:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2011/318/b803157f-11d6-41de-a680-e170d6ca3f17@news.ap.org.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
