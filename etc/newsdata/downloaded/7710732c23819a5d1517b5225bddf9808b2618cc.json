One upshot of England\u2019s alarmingly limp performance in Prague was that it diverted attention, however briefly, from a topic that always seemed likely to dominate the noises around Monday night\u2019s game against Bulgaria in Sofia.\n\nNot so fast. England abroad: it is in many ways the never-ending story. Albeit one that seems in recent years to have involved shining a fearless light on the failings of others, even while the German bombers continue to fall, the Pope gets fucked and the bottles fly across the Baroque town squares. Ever wondered what other countries make of this myopia, the ability to say all the right things about supporter behaviour and issues of race, even while being trailed around by the most regularly disruptive supporters in European football?\n\nIf England walk off the pitch because of abuse, racism wins | Howard Gayle Read more\n\nWell now we know, as in the space of three hours on Sunday afternoon the talk around England\u2019s qualifier in Sofia was transformed into a kind of racist-off between the rival federations. First up came a remarkable press conference during which Krasimir Balakov accused England of having a greater problem with race than Bulgaria. In response Gareth Southgate again offered the usual measured front, before fielding some more immediate questions about how England might respond to racist abuse of their players in the Stadion Vasil Levski on Monday night.\n\nThe situation had already been inflamed by comments from the head of the Bulgarian FA, Boris Mihaylov, that got slightly lost in the matchday glare on Friday night. In a statement to Uefa, Mihaylov cast England as provocateurs of the honest Bulgars, and effectively accused Southgate and Tammy Abraham of insulting the Bulgarian nation and its half-closed stadium.\n\nWhat about the other stuff? Will the England players walk off in Sofia at the first rendition of Ten German Bombers?\n\nIt is a terrible piece of timing from Mihaylov, an outburst that has now guaranteed rising tension. Quite how the crowds will now react is open to question. This would have been far better left to Tuesday morning. Mihaylov really would have been better off keeping his hair on here. But there is another side to this. The side that says, actually both Mihaylov and Balakov have a point. First things first: Abraham is also right to suggest England\u2019s players might consider walking off if they are racially abused.\n\nThis is not an approving judgment on his words. They don\u2019t require validation. There is no rulebook on how people should feel about being racially abused. Walking off seems entirely logical in the circumstances, and anyone who does so will have this page\u2019s unconditional support.\n\nBut what about the other stuff? Will the England players walk off the pitch in Sofia at the first rendition of Ten German Bombers? Will the management threaten to abandon a fixture the next time English people trash a European town centre in their name? Are some forms of xenophobia and abusive behaviour better than others? \u201cThere is almost no kind of outrage,\u201d George Orwell wrote in his Notes on Nationalism, \u201cwhich does not change its moral colour when it is committed by \u2018our\u2019 side.\u201d\n\nIt is worth remembering the other thing that happened on Friday night. The disorder in Prague was relatively mild. This is where we\u2019ve got to now. A few arrests, some stun grenades, complaints from locals, smashed glass. This is almost a victory.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tammy Abraham is right to suggest England\u2019s players might walk off in the event of racial abuse.

And before that we had France and the Euros, and the first appearance en masse of this new raft of younger, chemically-charged lads with their semi-ironical chants, their occupation of the city centres; the idea, through it all, that this is all just a bit of a laugh.\n\nLet\u2019s call it what it is. The educated English travelling boor may understand that racism is wrong. But intimidating people, smashing property for the sake of it and generally treating locals like un-people is also a public form of xenophobia. It is an offshoot of the same English blindness that says this behaviour is simply a low-level background hum, lads having too much beer.\n\nIt was there in the English exceptionalism of the police briefings before these qualifiers, when it was made clear that our boys had done all they could to urge Uefa to switch the Czech game from Friday night \u2013 and yet astonishingly the Euro-wonks refused to alter the schedule to accommodate our uncontrollable minority of idiots.\n\nAnd yes of course this is the minority of England fans. There are so many England travelling supporters who make friends and enjoy the experience. But the fact is these issues bleed into one another and become impossible to ignore or brush aside.\n\nHopefully there will be no need for alarm, for walk-offs and all the rest in the Levski. If there is it seems clear there should be zero tolerance of abuse.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBut perhaps it\u2019s time also to start applying those standards both ways, for the Football Association, the players and the manager to call on their own fans to behave better, to stow the nationalism, to respect the locals, or risk losing some of their own allocation; perhaps even to find themselves invited not to travel at all.\n\nOrwell wrote better than most about English hypocrisy and English exceptionalism. Which are, lest we forget, the best hypocrisy, the best exceptionalism in the world. Faced with Football: 2019 he would perhaps invite us to imagine the moral authority England could claim on matters of supporter behaviour if they could only bring themselves to apply these principles universally; and to begin with the strongest possible stance on their own doorstep.", "description": "Intimidation, casual vandalism and generally treating locals like un-people is also a form of xenophobia", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bdbbe63635fbdebf476653ee87765066bdac0de/0_401_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fbf744c628dedc27f2c63710dfdb34ff", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
