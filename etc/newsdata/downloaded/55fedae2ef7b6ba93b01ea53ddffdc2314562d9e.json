Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a neuromuscular condition caused by a lack of protein called dystrophin. Around 100 boys with the serious condition, which causes progressive muscle weakness, are born in the UK each year. It is a genetic condition and can be inherited. The condition starts early in childhood and maybe detected when noticing a child has difficulty standing up. Children with DMD will struggle to walk, climb and run. The condition causes muscles throughout the body to weaken and waste, including those of the heart and chest.
