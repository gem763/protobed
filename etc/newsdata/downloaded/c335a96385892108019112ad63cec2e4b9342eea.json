Next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics are in July and August, when the women\u2019s soccer season in South Africa will be in action.\n\nSemenya is barred from defending her 800 title at this month\u2019s world championships after refusing to follow IAAF rules requiring her to reduce her natural testosterone. She is appealing against those rules at the Swiss supreme court.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Caster Semenya has signed for a South African soccer club and may be considering giving up track and field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
