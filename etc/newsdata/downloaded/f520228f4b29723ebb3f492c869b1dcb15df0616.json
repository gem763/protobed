Since 2012, he's achieved net annualized returns of 19.7%, with his most recent performance tipping the scales at 26.1%. Over that same time period, the S&P 500's performance pales in comparison, with a roughly 13% annualized return.\n\nAlong Kiel's road to hedge fund founder and manager, he was able to develop his investment strategy through the application of a few key books. He took bits and pieces of information from the greats: Warren Buffett, Joel Greenblatt, Seth Klarman, Charlie Munger, Ben Graham \u2014 and wound up with a highly concentrated, valued-focused approach.\n\nRead more: The man who wrote the book on how to make 100 times your money with a single stock outlines the core principles of his investing approach \u2014 and shares his 2 top under-the-radar picks\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Kiel relayed how these books transformed his life and investment strategy.\n\n\"I think you really have to start on businesses and biographies and things like that,\" he said.\n\nFor Kiel, the book that started it all was \"Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist.\"\n\n\"That crystalized an appreciation for him,\" he said.\n\nThe tale describes Buffett's path to becoming the world's most famous and renowned investor. It's a story of true entrepreneurship, curiosity, and determination. Today, the Oracle of Omaha's net worth sits around a stratospheric $80 billion, so it's safe to say that Kiel started his quest in the right place.\n\nBut he was just getting started \u2014 and after he had a solid understanding of business firmly in place, he moved onto \"Margin of Safety\" by Seth Klarman and \"You Can be a Stock Market Genius\" by Joel Greenblatt \u2014 two books that were paramount in shaping his investment philosophy. These works \"put it all together.\"\n\n\"By the time I got to 'Margin of Safety' to read, I was ready for it,\" he said. \"If I were to have read that first, I would not really have appreciated the tactics that he writes about.\"\n\nKiel makes an important point here \u2014 one that is often overlooked. The order in which an investor reads is paramount. Trying to read an advanced investment book without a solid foundation of understanding can be overwhelming. There's just too much information, and much of it passes you by.\n\n\"You do have to be careful about what order you read things in because you don't appreciate them,\" Kiel said. \"If you have no basis or background of what business is, then you're not really going to get it.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"Same thing with 'You can be a Stock Market Genius.' There's 50 different ways to profit from that book.\"", "description": "Steven Kiel, self-made founder and portfolio manager at Arquitos Capital, taught himself how to invest through DIY tactics.
