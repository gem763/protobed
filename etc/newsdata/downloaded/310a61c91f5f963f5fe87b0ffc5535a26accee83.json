At first, it was agony seeing the near misses \u2013 almost as bad for me watching as for you playing! But at least I only had the tension for half an hour before getting the result I was longing for\u2026\u201d Give in? It\u2019s from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s handwritten letter congratulating Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes on a victory over Manchester United in February 1978. Hard to know what\u2019s more incredible \u2013 that the Tory leader was an avid football fan or that she should have displayed a fondness for anything Liverpudlian at all.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of surprise that keeps ambushing the reader during Who Dares Wins, Dominic Sandbrook\u2019s long, painstaking and pretty enjoyable haul through Britain in the first three years of the Thatcher government. This is the first big contemporary account of an era I can remember living through (I was 15 in 1979) and you may feel a nice balance of piquancy and poignancy in having those years brought to life by the historian\u2019s magic wand. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s a clear arc to the narrative, from the grim-and-bear-it years of 1979-80 to the turning-point summer of 1982, when victory in the Falklands enhanced Thatcher\u2019s image as \u201cBritannia incarnate\u201d and rescued her government from near ignominy.\n\nOr did it? The reality was more complicated, says Sandbrook. Even before the Argentinian invasion the Tories had been on an upswing, inflation was falling, business improving, and their approval rate was more than 30%. This contrasts with the opening sections of the book, which lay out the sorry state of Britain at the turn of the 80s \u2013 economic decline, unemployment, inflation, violence in Northern Ireland, strikes, riots, and a general sense that our days of being \u201cGreat\u201d were long gone. The received wisdom is that Thatcher set about destroying British industry by hammering the unions, instituting cash controls \u2013 monetarism \u2013 and plunging the country into recession. But, as Sandbrook argues, coal, steel and car-making had been in steep decline for years, and the recession would have happened even under Labour. Similarly, the right to buy, the Tories\u2019 controversial sale of council houses, predated Thatcher by at least a decade; her twist on the policy was to make it law.\n\nMrs Thatcher enjoyed watching snooker, though leisure was not something she understood\n\nIf Who Dares Wins were only a rehearsal of the political scene it would be a tough read. Instead, it leavens the load by ranging over the sights, sounds and smells of an era that looks almost quaint 40 years on. Hard to credit, for instance, how awful restaurant food was back then, not to mention the state of the office worker\u2019s sandwich. Marks & Spencer changed the game with its triangular-packed sarnies in 1980, a year after its breakthrough ready-meal chicken kiev (\u00a31.99 for a two-pack). Wine bars proliferated, and with them a music to match their new clientele\u2019s aspirations \u2013 Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and all their be-frilled confr\u00e8res. Sandbrook is especially good on sport, not just the headline-grabbers of Ovett-Coe, Botham\u2019s Ashes and the boycotted Moscow Olympics but the quieter revolution of snooker, the first televised sport watched by more women than men. Women playing snooker, though, was still resisted in a time when private clubs were exempt from the Sex Discrimination Act.\n\nThatcher enjoyed watching snooker, too \u2013 in the end this book\u2019s diffuse pathways all lead back to her \u2013 though leisure was not something she understood. She lived to work. Sandbrook is ungratifyingly even-handed in his portrait of her, alive to the flaws in her character and sharp in confounding the popular myths. For example, Thatcherism is closely bound up with an age dependent on credit, yet she herself was puritanical to a fault and disapproved of borrowing \u2013 she never owned a credit card. There is an omission, however, and a glaring one, when Sandbrook describes her as \u201cremarkably sympathetic\u201d to her minister Cecil Parkinson after the scandal of his affair broke in 1983, but fails to mention how unsympathetic she was to Sara Keays, the secretary Parkinson made pregnant and publicly abandoned. But then she was never much of a champion for women.\n\nIf the book does have an undeclared villain it\u2019s one from the opposite end of the political spectrum: Tony Benn. The case against him is meticulously rendered by Sandbrook and includes duplicity, opportunism, vanity, \u201csectarian intolerance\u201d and \u201cruthless pursuit of internal feuds\u201d. The surprise, to me, was that the last two charges were voiced by his one-time colleague Michael Foot.\n\nHovering over Who Dares Wins, I\u2019m afraid, is the old line about those who fail to learn from history being doomed to repeat it. 1979-82 was an era of crises in transport and infrastructure, a Labour party hamstrung by internal strife, a government fronted by the most divisive leader in years, a people bitterly disunited and a nation staring disaster in the face.
