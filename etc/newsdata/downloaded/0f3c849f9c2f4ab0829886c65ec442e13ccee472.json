(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nBaseball is not for the faint of heart. But what is? Saddle up.\n\nThe past two days in Nationals Park have illustrated the constant difficult demands, moments of unexpected exhilaration, stories of inspiration and games of frustration that seem to punctuate every season. In three interlocking episodes, all jammed within 18 hours, we see again why baseball strikes its fans so deeply, binds them to it and constantly reminds us that the qualities of character that play best on a diamond also work for all of us wherever we are.\n\nFirst came the Nats\u2019 historic comeback Tuesday night against the Mets. Trailing by six runs to start the bottom of the ninth, the Nats walked off winners eight batters later, with an 11-10 victory that few who saw it will ever forget. It was rarer than a perfect game. It was a comeback that gave disbelief a black eye and doubt a bloody nose.\n\n[Hours after historic comeback, Nats fall flat in finale vs. Mets]\n\nSimilar feats \u2014 rallying from six runs down in the ninth to win in that inning \u2014 have happened only six times since records of such thing were kept starting in 1925. There was much dancing on South Capitol Street and much flushing \u2014 of Mets playoff chances \u2014 in Flushing.\n\nTold that only two teams had ever come back from bigger deficits in the ninth inning \u2014 both seven runs behind \u2014 Ryan Zimmerman said, disbelieving, \u201cThere are better ones than that!?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cool game, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Adam Eaton said.\n\nA few hours later, on Wednesday morning, reliever Aaron Barrett reported to the Nats clubhouse, summoned back to the majors after a four-year comeback from an elbow injury. When Barrett\u2019s arm snapped, the humerus broken, onlookers said it sounded like \u201ca gunshot\u201d and looked like his elbow had \u201cexploded.\u201d Mat Latos, a 6-foot-6 veteran pitcher covered with scary tattoos, went to the dugout to vomit. The surgeon who reassembled Barrett, with plates and 18 pins, said it was a car-wreck injury, not anything you\u2019d expect in baseball.\n\n[Svrluga: Seven-run rally could be Nats\u2019 springboard to October]\n\n\u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to throw a ball \u2014 in general. Then there were times where I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d get through it \u2014 just the pain was too much,\u201d said Barrett, in the Nats clubhouse. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a quitter, never have been and I found it in myself to keep pushing forward.\n\n\u201cCalled my wife [Tuesday]. I was crying obviously, she was balling. Told her \u2018We\u2019re going back,\u2019 \u201d said Barrett, who saved 31 games in Class AA. \u201cShe was basically my nurse for two years \u2026 She\u2019s been my rock. Not only her, my family, this whole organization \u2014 incredible.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d added Barrett, probably because he\u2019d teared up and choked up while talking. I can\u2019t confirm that \u2014 things looked kind of blurry to me.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a guy whose arm basically discombobulated,\u201d Nats Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWhenever he comes out to pitch [his first game back] \u2014 for him, for everybody \u2014 the emotions are going to be flaring.\u201d\n\n[D.C. Sports Bog: The seven best reactions to the Nats\u2019 walk-off win over Mets]\n\nThe odds on the Nats\u2019 comeback can be calculated: 0.1 percent, according to baseball-reference.com. The odds of Barrett\u2019s return are incalculable and almost incomprehensible.\n\nHowever, they both illustrate the same point: Baseball provides fabulous memories. But, usually, they come at a steep price. Not only does the game reject the fainthearted, it constantly tests both heart and will, aggravates the nerves and attacks self-confidence. Of everyone involved, it demands the character not to quit \u2014 and that demand is made almost every day. But then what walk, or way, of life doesn\u2019t?\n\nThat, as much as anything, is probably why we love and, quite often, almost hate this game. Why does it have to be so hard? And so hard so often \u2014 162 or more times a year. The game is not only tough work for those who play it, but also for those who choose to watch it, and in the case of millions, become mesmerized, almost transfixed for decades by it as fans.\n\nFor example, how hard was Wednesday when the Nats, who came to the park so happy, and flying high at greeting Barrett, were smacked in their pennant-race faces by \u2014 Who was that other team on the field? Weren\u2019t the Metropolitans disbanded after that 11-10 loss? \u2014 oh, yes, the Mets.\n\nThe Nats wanted to back up their gritty \u201cStay in the Fight\u201d win with another body blow to the Mets. That would send them flying to Atlanta to face the Braves trailing in the NL East by six games. Sure, probably too much to overcome with only 24 games left, but let\u2019s take our shot.\n\nInstead, the Mets took their shot. That was Act III of this two-day play. The Nats put eight men on base in the first three innings and lashed four other line drives off the Mets\u2019 Zack Wheeler, whom they\u2019d drubbed for a 7.95 ERA in four earlier starts this year. Every smash found a Met glove \u2014 just as three hits in Tuesday\u2019s comeback found turf.\n\nThe Mets, who entered the day with a 7.7 percent chance to make the playoffs, as opposed to the Nats\u2019 98.6 chance to reach October, won rather easily, 8-4, shoving Washington a full seven games behind Atlanta. The next four are in Atlanta, so dream all you want. But even winning three of four leaves only long-shot math.\n\nPerhaps because the Nats are such a veteran team, they sense their situation far more accurately than most teams. \u201cWe\u2019re made for October. Just get there,\u201d said Brian Dozier.\n\n\u201cEleven wins [in October] gets you a nice trophy,\u201d noted Martinez.\n\nAnalysis by the math folk at baseball-reference says that the Nats\u2019 chances of winning the World Series (6.5 percent) are only slightly worse than their chance of passing the Braves (7.7 percent). So, ironic as it seems, focusing on the division race probably misses much of the point of this season. Seven September meetings with the Braves will be fun to watch, and a measuring stick for the Nats. But it\u2019s probably most important that, between now the playoffs, ace Max Scherzer and closer Sean Doolittle get back to top form.\n\nScherzer showed some progress in six decent innings Tuesday while Doolittle topped 94 mph on his fastball and showed an improved spin rate in one inning Wednesday. So, Obi-Sean may be close to standing tall again. That is, if he can stop falling down.\n\nOnce on a liner back through the box, and once when he simply messed up his mechanics and fell into a heap on the mound, Doolittle ended up a scary vulnerable mess on the hill.\n\n\u201cThis was a definite improvement. Now I need to keep hitting 94 and learn to stand up. I came back [into the clubhouse] looking for some bubble wrap to put around us so we can get to Atlanta in one piece,\u201d joked Doolittle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a mistake if we start saying: \u2018We have to win X out of X of these games to put ourselves in position,\u2019 \u201d Doolittle added. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to go take it one game at a time. I know it sounds really cliche, but they\u2019re too good for us to take a big-picture approach.\u201d\n\nIn baseball, the biggest picture you\u2019re allowed to take sometimes seems to be just one day.\n\n\u201cTake a nice cold shower. Catch a bus. Take a plane,\u201d said Martinez. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d\n\nFlawed, the bunch of \u2019em, but definitely not faint of heart.", "description": "The game has never been for the faint of heart \u2014 just ask Mets fans on Tuesday night or Nats fans on Wednesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Tom Boswell Has Been A Washington Post Sports Columnist Since He Started At The Post In As A Copy Aide", "He Spent Years As A General-Assignment Reporter", "Covering Baseball", "Golf", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xTp-jkcQdRM-8sckcvT-CET_4Kg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7R4WAGPLYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
