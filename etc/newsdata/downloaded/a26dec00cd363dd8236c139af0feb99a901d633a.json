Because we are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton. ... Until the Republicans free themselves of that hatred, our country will suffer.\u201d\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY -- WILL IT BACKFIRE?\n\nClinton was impeached on Dec. 19, 1998, by the House on charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice stemming from a lawsuit filed by Paula Jones alleging sexual harassment. On Feb. 12, 1999, the Senate acquitted Clinton in a presidential impeachment trial and he remained in office.\n\n\n\nThe clip of Pelosi, which aired on \"Fox & Friends\" Wednesday, went viral after House Democrats moved forward on an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, alleging he may have withheld military aid to Ukraine while pressuring the country to investigate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nFLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED\n\nThe hosts asked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, about Pelosi's remarks. Gingrich said, unlike the current impeachment push against Trump, Ken Starr's report alleged crimes against Clinton, prompting the House to act.\n\n\"In the case of Clinton, he had actually broken the law. He had committed a felony in a case involving sexual predation against an employee. If that happened today, people would be going crazy. That's not the case here,\" said Gingrich, claiming Hunter Biden did a lot of \"weird\" business deals in Ukraine and China and Trump is within his rights to want that investigated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe said historians will someday look back at House Democrats' impeachment inquiry as the \"theater of the absurd.\"\n\nGingrich noted that Trump delivered an \"extraordinary\" address to the United Nations on religious freedom this week, but it has gone mostly unnoticed by the media because \"the Democratic Party has lost its mind.\"\n\nPelosi announced the impeachment inquiry Tuesday, declaring that \"no one is above the law\" and Trump \"must be held accountable.\" She alleged that Trump committed a \"betrayal of his oath of office, a betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\"", "description": "House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0was singing a very different tune on impeachment when it was President Bill Clinton who was being accused by a Republican-led House of Representatives.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/pelosi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
