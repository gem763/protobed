Then my friend ran away towards this direction. After that he fell down and was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife,\u201d an associate of the injured man told media at the scene.\n\nPlastered in colourful sticky-notes, posters and slogans, \u201cLennon Walls\u201d have appeared in more than a hundred locations around Hong Kong, often in pedestrian tunnels or near subway stations.\n\nThough the walls are seen as a peaceful protest method, they have also become flashpoints for violence.\n\nIn recent months, fights have broken out when groups of men who support the Hong Kong government have tried to tear the posters down, or between people with different political views.\n\nOn Wednesday Jimmy Sham \u2014 a leading face of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement \u2014 was taken to hospital covered in blood after being attacked with hammers by unidentified thugs.\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, which Sham leads, had applied for permission to hold a peaceful rally on Sunday calling for an independent inquiry into police brutality and universal suffrage, but their request was rejected by the police.\n\nHowever the march is still expected to take place despite the ban.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s more than four months of huge and increasingly violent protests were initially sparked by a now-scrapped bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.\n\nThey have since snowballed into a wider movement calling for greater democracy and police accountability after Beijing and local leaders took a hard line.\n\nMultiple pro-democracy activists have been attacked by pro-Beijing supporters in recent months, and Sham was also assaulted in August.\n\nAs the violence has escalated, hardcore pro-democracy protesters have also begun meting out their own street justice, beating people who vocally disagree with their goals or are viewed to be government loyalists.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 A man handing out leaflets for a Hong Kong pro-democracy protest was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant who slashed his neck", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/cf8694_hong-kong-lennon-walls-are-as-peaceful-protest-method-but-flashpoints-violence-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
