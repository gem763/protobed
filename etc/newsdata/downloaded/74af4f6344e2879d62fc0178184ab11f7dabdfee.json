But it\u2019s not all sunshine and roses.\n\nApple\u2019s latest operating system update for the iPhone brings some major improvements, like a system-wide Dark Mode, a handful of updates to Apple-made applications, a swipe-to-type keyboard, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple also made some changes that I personally don\u2019t like, and don\u2019t understand.\n\nRead more: Apple used helicopters and drones to film stunning 4K screensavers for the Apple TV \u2013 here\u2019s how to get them on your computer\n\nIn some ways, it felt like Apple could have done more; in other ways, it felt like Apple made unnecessary changes that actually feel like a step backwards.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a lot to love about iOS 13, here are the 7 most disappointing features from the new iPhone update.\n\n1. Apple should have done more with Apple Mail, which received a minor update but still lacks basic features that other email apps have.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nApple Mail is nice and clean, but it still lacks a lot of the features I want in an email app.\n\nApple Mail now has rich text, but it still has no ability to label your emails in different ways other than to flag them. (See how many \u201cFlagged\u201d emails I have?)\n\nApple\u2019s Mail app also doesn\u2019t sort your emails in ways that other email apps do \u2013 like when it detects an email contains a plane ticket, or a receipt. Edison Email, a free mail app I\u2019ve been using for the past several years, can automatically categorize your emails into \u201csubscriptions,\u201d \u201ctravel,\u201d \u201cpackages,\u201d \u201cbills and receipts,\u201d and \u201centertainment.\u201d I\u2019m still waiting on Apple to implement a feature like this, so I can quickly find my plane ticket receipts, for example.\n\nAlso, if you want to tweak your Mail settings, you can\u2019t do it in the Mail app; you have to visit the Settings app and scroll down to Mail.\n\nOverall, Apple could have done much more with Mail. I was excited to re-open this app for the first time in years, but came away disappointed. I\u2019ll be sticking with Edison Email for now.\n\n2. You still can\u2019t make text messages \u201cunread.\u201d\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nI don\u2019t always want to respond to text messages right away. Sometimes, I want to treat them like emails, and mark them as \u201cunread\u201d so it\u2019s easier to come back to them later. There\u2019s still no way to do this in iOS 13.\n\n3. The main new feature in Apple Maps \u2014 the \u201cLook Around\u201d feature, which rivals Google\u2019s Street View \u2014 is only in one city that I can find.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nI was so excited to open Apple Maps and try out the new Look Around feature, which is smoother and easier to use than Google\u2019s Street View, where you need to drop a little icon onto the area you want to see at street level.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple Maps Look Around isn\u2019t available in my city (Toronto). It\u2019s not even available in New York City, one of the most populous cities in the world.\n\nI tried Look Around in so many cities, but it\u2019s only available in three cities at the moment: San Francisco (of course), Las Vegas, and Honolulu. I find this incredibly disappointing, especially since Apple was emphasizing this feature so much in the lead-up to this release.\n\n4. The Clock app still won\u2019t let you change the snooze function: It is set at 9 minutes.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nAs long as Apple\u2019s Clock app has existed, the \u201cSnooze\u201d function will only go off every nine minutes. Not 10 minutes. Not eight minutes. Just nine minutes. And you can\u2019t tweak it at all, in case you want your snooze to be shorter like five minutes, or longer like 15 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s apparently a tradition to have clocks set their snooze to nine minutes, which is why Apple does this, but I think it\u2019s a dumb tradition that has little merit.\n\n5. There\u2019s no way to toggle Dark Mode in specific apps \u2014 changes can only be made system-wide.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nIn iOS 13, you can have Light Mode, Dark Mode, or have Apple automatically transition the look of your phone based on the time of day.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no way to have certain apps default to Light Mode or Dark Mode. For instance, I prefer Dark Mode across the entire system, but I want to keep Apple Maps in Light Mode for the sake of legibility. But there\u2019s currently no way to do this.\n\n6. You can\u2019t delete the new Bedtime alarm in the Clock app.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\niOS 12 introduced a feature called Bedtime Mode, which let you know the ideal time to go to sleep to get the most rest before waking up the next day.\n\nIn iOS 13, Bedtime Mode is still its own tab, but there\u2019s a new Bedtime Alarm in your Alarms tab that you simply can\u2019t delete.\n\nAs someone who tried Bedtime Mode last year, and didn\u2019t like it, being unable to remove this feature from my Alarms tab is going to drive my OCD off the charts.\n\n7. I don\u2019t like how you make new reminders in the overhauled Reminders app.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nIn the old version of Reminders, adding a new reminder was as simple as writing some text and then choosing the day and time to be reminded.\n\nIn iOS 13, where Reminders has been completely overhauled, the day and time are now separate. And when you click \u201cRemind me on a day,\u201d it won\u2019t tell you which day is \u201cToday\u201d or \u201cTomorrow,\u201d like it did in iOS 12. Now, you need to know, off-hand, the specific date.\n\nIf you want to see which days are \u201cToday\u201d or \u201cTomorrow,\u201d you need to toggle the option below, which says \u201cRemind me at a time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a small change, but it\u2019s now one extra step to see which day and time you want to be reminded, and I really liked being able to immediately know if a reminder was for \u201cToday\u201d or \u201cTomorrow\u201d instead of needing to know the date.\n\nThere are a bunch of other letdowns in iOS 13.\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nApple\u2019s Calendar app didn\u2019t change at all. The Siri Shortcuts app still feels totally unnecessary, and it\u2019s puzzling to me why Apple made it a default in iOS 13 instead of giving people the option to download it from the App Store.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing aspect of this is that Apple likely won\u2019t change any of these features until iOS 14, given how the company seems to save any significant software changes for its annual update.\n\nWhat do you like, or don\u2019t like, about iOS 13?\n\nsource Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you.
