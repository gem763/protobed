But the subsequent apologies from Bill Self and athletics director Jeff Long arguably made Kansas look like a program that didn't even know what a Snoop Dogg concert entailed.\n\nSnoop Dogg, though, took Kansas' apology as a knee-jerk response to the backlash. He said that everyone had a great time and that Kansas knew what it paid for.\n\nSnoop Dogg said in a Tuesday appearance on The Howard Stern Show, via TMZ:\n\n\"The audience enjoyed that (expletive). I don't know what the (expletive) they talking about.\"\n\nOpinion:NCAA's message to Bill Self: You're a cheater and we want you out of college basketball\n\nMore:Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski supports California's Fair Pay To Play Act\n\nStern asked Snoop about being asked to leave after the performance \u2026 which he denies.\n\n\"That's a (expletive) lie. I had the time of my life. I enjoyed myself, hung out with the basketball teams.\"\n\nSnoop continued:\n\n\"I think it was more the publicity of what I did. they had to cover it up. And, I respect them, and I wasn't gonna put no smut on their name and say they did anything wrong because they invited me to come do what I do.\"\n\n\"And, when you pay for Snoop Dogg, you gon' get Snoop Dogg.\"\n\nThat they did.", "description": "Snoop Dogg took to the airwaves to defend his performance at Kansas basketball's preseason kick-off event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/08/USAT/dcc58b2a-2194-440c-b50e-50818617491f-AP_Kansas-Late_Night_Basketball.JPG?crop=2206,1241,x0,y170&width=1859&height=1241&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
