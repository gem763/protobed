He doesn\u2019t need protecting. Every time I name a squad Andy is the first to reply, \u2018When is it gaffer? I\u2019ll see you there!\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to go down the route of talking about every pundit who has something bad to say about the national team.\n\n\"The only way to stop them saying bad things is to start winning games. I don\u2019t hide from that fact.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nRedknapp had said: \"Football is always easier when you are playing with better players.\n\n\"The quality just isn't there in Scotland right now. That is no disrespect to the players he is playing with for Scotland, but they are not as good as the ones he plays with at Liverpool.\n\n\"He has an incredible understanding with Sadio Mane, Mo Salah - that has been happening for years.\n\n\"John Barnes found it harder to play for England than he did for Liverpool because he played with better players.\n\n\"Andy gives his all in every game, he is a great player and incredibly proud to play for Scotland.\n\n\"The way Liverpool play, they get it in to the wide areas and play so high up the pitch.\n\n\"A lot of the time when he is playing for Scotland, they are going to be defending more, so he hasn't got the time to get up the pitch and make his crosses.\"\n\nScotland are away to Russia in on Thursday before hosting San Marino three days later. They are fifth in Group I with Belgium and Russia appearing to have the group sewn up between them.", "description": "Former Liverpool midfielder said Reds left-back was being dragged down by Scotland teammates", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541726.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Scotland-v-Cyprus-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
