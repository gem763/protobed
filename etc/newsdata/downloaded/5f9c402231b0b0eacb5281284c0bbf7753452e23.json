REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Scotland\u2019s top court has delayed a ruling on whether British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has fully obeyed a law which demanded he request a delay to Brexit.\n\nThe so-called Benn Act compelled Johnson to write a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit extension if parliament had not approved either a deal or a no-deal exit by Saturday. Johnson had repeatedly said he would not ask for a delay.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan to put his Brexit withdrawal deal to the UK parliament on Saturday was derailed after lawmakers voted to withhold a decision on the deal, a move that forced him to seek a third postponement of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nJohnson sent an unsigned letter to the EU requesting a delay but added another note in which he said he did not want a \u201cdeeply corrosive\u201d Brexit extension\n\nThat prompted some lawmakers to say he was seeking to frustrate the law, and anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court to keep monitoring Johnson.\n\n\u201cI am delighted with the Court\u2019s decision. It is a pity to have to say it, but this is not a Prime Minister who can be trusted to comply with the law,\u201d Jolyon Maugham, a lawyer involved in the case, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAnd because he cannot be trusted he must be supervised.\u201d\n\nThe Benn Act also states that Britain\u2019s government must accept any delay to Brexit that is offered. Brexit is currently due to take place on Oct. 31.", "description": "Scotland's top court has delayed a ruling on whether British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has fully obeyed a law which demanded he request a delay to Brexit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443348367&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0X3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
