I wasn't playing at Sheffield United but couldn't complain because they were doing really well and won promotion,\" he told the Mail Online .\n\n(Image: X03811)\n\n\"I have learned so much at Oxford this season, knowing I am able to play 90 minutes and keep fighting for the team. I have taken a lot of kicks and heavy tackles and shown I'm not lightweight.\n\n\"I feel like I have had so much experience and yet I am still only young and learning. Watching someone like Serge Gnabry develop is a big help.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I saw his four goals for Bayern Munich against Tottenham in the Champions League. When he was 20, he couldn't get a game on loan at West Brom.\n\n\"He has shown you can push through if you keep working hard and hopefully I can do something like he's done.\"", "description": "The Welshman has joined League One side Oxford United on loan this season, but is currently sidelined", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584127.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wales-vs-Trinidad-and-Tobago-International-Friendly-at-The-Racecourse-Ground-Wrexham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
