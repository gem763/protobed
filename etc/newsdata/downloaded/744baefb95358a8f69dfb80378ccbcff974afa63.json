Such a wonderfully ubiquitous construction tool. Especially if you\u2019re just putting up a picture on the wall, doing a quick repair on something, or just venting your frustration.\n\nBut seriously, if the job is more involved, and you\u2019ll be hammering away until you\u2019ve got a headache, you\u2019ll really want to get a nail gun or nailer. Not only does a nail gun save you a hell of a lot of time, you\u2019ll save yourself the headache as well. Instead of multiple taps to get than nail in, you\u2019ll need only one from the nail gun\u2014pow!\u2014and it\u2019s in.\n\nThere are two types of firing mechanisms in a nail gun:\n\nOne is dual-contact firing , where the nail will fire as long as you hold down the trigger and press the nosing against the work. This allows you to fire a nail, move to the next spot and continue with a series of nails without having to release and re-press the trigger each time.\n\n, where the nail will fire as long as you hold down the trigger and press the nosing against the work. This allows you to fire a nail, move to the next spot and continue with a series of nails without having to release and re-press the trigger each time. The other is sequential firing, which is a bit safer. This requires that you release the trigger first, before each nail is fired. The nosing must be pressed onto the work before the trigger will function. Improvements in safety of nail guns is ongoing.\n\nBelow, you'll find a list of different types of nail guns you might choose, and a description of what each one is good for.", "description": "When it comes to nail guns, unfortunately one size doesn\u2019t fit all.
