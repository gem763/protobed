(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Prestigious universities around the world have accepted at least $60 million over the past five years from the family that owns the maker of OxyContin, even as the company became embroiled in lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic, financial records show.\n\nSome of the donations arrived before recent lawsuits blaming Purdue Pharma for its role in the opioid crisis. But at least nine schools accepted gifts in 2018 or later, when states and counties across the country began efforts to hold members of the family accountable for Purdue\u2019s actions. The largest gifts in that span went to Imperial College London, the University of Sussex and Yale University.\n\nMajor beneficiaries of Sackler family foundations also included the University of Oxford in England and Rockefeller, Cornell and Columbia universities in New York, according to tax and charity records reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nIn total, at least two dozen universities have received gifts from the family since 2013, ranging from $25,000 to more than $10 million, the records show.\n\nSome skeptics see the donations as an attempt to salvage the family\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cMoney from the Sacklers should be understood as blood money,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a leading critic of Purdue and the Sacklers who has testified against the company in court and heads a program on opioid policy at Brandeis University, which was not among the schools identified in tax records as receiving donations from the Sacklers. \u201cUniversities shouldn\u2019t take it, and universities that have taken it should give it back.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of family members declined to comment.\n\nThe AP reviewed charitable giving from more than a dozen Sackler family foundations as reported to the Internal Revenue Service, the Canada Revenue Agency and the Charity Commission for England and Wales. The recipients included schools in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel.\n\nFor decades, the family has been a major philanthropic figure in the worlds of art, medicine and education. They were listed by Forbes magazine in 2016 as one of the nation\u2019s 20 wealthiest families, with holdings of $13 billion.\n\nMuch of their giving to universities has fueled research in areas including genetics and brain development. Other gifts supported medical schools, student scholarships and faculty jobs. It amounts to a small fraction of schools\u2019 overall fundraising, but some say the money has been a boon to important programs.\n\nWhen evaluating the ethics of Sackler gifts, some experts argue, it\u2019s important to consider what schools knew about the family and when they knew it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this through the lens of what people know now,\u201d said Ross Cheit, chairman of the Rhode Island Ethics Commission and a professor at Brown University, which has accepted donations from the Sacklers. \u201cMy sense is, during the time period we\u2019re talking about, people\u2019s views about that source of money changed _ a lot.\u201d\n\nAs opioid deaths have mounted, some schools joined with businesses and museums cutting ties with the family, but none plans to return the money. One school is redirecting unspent donations. Most schools refused to say whether they would accept donations in the future.\n\nKolodny, who is also director of the group Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said the money, if returned, could be used to help cities and states harmed by the opioid crisis, which has killed more than 400,000 people in the U.S. in the past two decades.\n\nThe family\u2019s ties with colleges have come under fire recently from some students, alumni and politicians.\n\nPetitions at New York University and Tel Aviv University called on the schools to strip the Sackler name from research institutes. A 2018 lawsuit from the Massachusetts attorney general argued that Purdue Pharma used its influence at Tufts University and other schools to promote the company\u2019s opioids.\n\nTufts, near Boston, said it is reviewing its relationship with Purdue and declined to answer questions until the review is finished. The university\u2019s school of graduate biomedical studies was founded with a Sackler gift in 1980 and carries the family\u2019s name.\n\nKolodny said schools should have known about the Sacklers\u2019 role in the opioid crisis after 2007, when Purdue pleaded guilty to federal charges that it misled the public about the risks of OxyContin. In that case, the company agreed to pay more than $600 million in civil and criminal penalties. By 2017, he said, the Sacklers\u2019 ties to Purdue and OxyContin were common knowledge.", "description": "Prestigious universities around the world have accepted at least $60 million over the past five years from the family that owns the maker of OxyContin, even as the company became embroiled in lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic, financial records show.
