Vallejuelos is a downtrodden neighbourhood, rife with crime and unemployment, but \u201cgravity biking\u201d is helping some kids escape their troubles.\n\nEstiven Hurtado and his modified bike\n\nAs the name suggests, gravity biking involves steep descents. Enthusiasts strip a typical bike to its frame and build it back up from scratch. To improve descending speed (which can reportedly reach up to 77 mph), riders weld weights to their contraptions. Pedals are superfluous: to climb the hills riders hang on to passing trucks, sometimes using homemade hooks on a line.\n\nIt\u2019s a self-destructive way of escaping the reality of their lives Natalia Montoya\n\nEstiven Hurtado is an avid gravity cyclist and has lived in Vallejuelos his whole life. \u201cWe live for gravity biking here,\u201d he says, lugging his modified bike behind him, emblazoned with the visage of the drug lord Pablo Escobar, Medell\u00edn\u2019s most infamous son. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life for anyone who lives up in the communes.\u201d\n\nRight: Estiven Hurtado and his friend Andres Callejas\n\nGravity biking can be found across Colombia, but it is most popular in Medell\u00edn and surrounding towns owing to the steep Andean mountains. But the nascent sport is as dangerous as it sounds, and last year one nearby town, La Ceja, banned it outright.\n\n\u201cGiven the grave danger, the decision was made to prohibit the circulation of bicycles modified by hand for this sport throughout the territory,\u201d said La Ceja\u2019s council at the time.\n\nThe gravity bike competition at the 29th car festival in Medell\u00edn, November 2018\n\nHours after meeting the Guardian, Hurtado is left injured at the side of the road after colliding with a motorcyclist on a tight bend down the hillside. Almost everyone who practices gravity biking at some point ends up in a similar situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the risk we run around here, but we get used to it,\u201d says Marlon Mu\u00f1eton, who at only 16 is seen as a leader among the gravity biking community. Shortly after the BBC published a video of his exploits last month, he had an accident, narrowly escaping serious injury and doing irreparable damage to his bike. He had twice before been gravely injured after crashing, nearly dying both times. His shaved head carries several scars.\n\nTop: Marlon Mu\u00f1eton. Bottom left and right: Riders ascend hills by hooking on to passing lorries\n\nHis mother, Jessica, speaks for much of the community. \u201cThey are fools the way they hurtle down the highways,\u201d she says in her ramshackle single-room home overlooking the city. \u201cJust look how many scars they all have.\u201d\n\nThe pastime has exposed fault lines in the neighbourhood where crime and unemployment are rampant. Criminal gangs and drug traffickers control much of Medell\u00edn\u2019s slums, and Estiven Hurtado\u2019s bike was confiscated by one of their members after his crash.\n\nThe gravity bike competition at the 29th car festival in Medell\u00edn, November 2018\n\n\u201cThese kids often come from broken homes, and often fall into drug abuse,\u201d says Natalia Montoya, a psychologist at the local school. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-destructive way of escaping the reality of their lives.\u201d\n\nThree cyclists from Vallejuelos have died this year, with accidents a regular occurrence. Montoya\u2019s school, where most of the children in the neighbourhood study, engages in campaigns to encourage rider safety, donating helmets. One particular issue is the practice of pillion riders, who are at more risk due to not being in control. Lights are almost never used.\n\n\u201cIf done safely, it is a good outlet for all of the stress that they have,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cBut there is still a lot more to do.\u201d\n\nLeft: Juan Pablo Morales with grazes. Right: the scene of a gravity biking accident.\n\nRiders prefer night-time as the roads are less busy, allowing them to pick up greater speed.\n\nDespite the risks, and despite regular altercations with the police who patrol the highways, it looks like gravity biking is here to stay.\n\nBehind the 'Medell\u00edn miracle': why the smart kids are going to hip-hop school Read more\n\nAs night falls, one group of riders waits at the roadside for a truck to latch on to. Among them is Juan Pablo Morales, who just a week earlier fell from his bike, badly grazing his face and chin. The accident has done little to dissuade him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first and it\u2019s not the last,\u201d he says, grinning broadly. \u201cIt\u2019ll take the most serious accident possible to stop me.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "The risky hillside pastime \u2013 which sees people hurtle down steep inclines on weighted bikes at up to 77 mph \u2013 is providing kids in downtrodden areas of Colombia\u2019s second city with an escape from their troubles", "authors": ["Joe Parkin Daniels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c347e4f5f7cc51b83c5bbcd9bfdf9e4f9e92b11/0_1128_2119_1271/master/2119.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d3987b1b1947d930d59402a99dda2474"}
