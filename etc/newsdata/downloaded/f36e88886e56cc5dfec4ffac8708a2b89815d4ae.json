(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s judicial nominee to a powerful federal bench in New York was grilled at his confirmation hearing Wednesday by senators of both parties, who accused him of lacking candor in his responses to their questions, especially around his work as associate counsel to Trump.\n\nSteven Menashi refused to answer most questions related to his work at the White House, specifically when asked if he had a role in the administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border and limiting the number of refugees allowed in the country.\n\nThe nominee would only say that he gave legal advice to senior policy advisers on a number of issues, including immigration, but would not say to whom or on what specific policies he advised the administration.\n\nAt one point, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) expressed his frustration with Menashi\u2019s guardedness around his work at the White House.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an unfair question. Did you work on the subject matter?\u201d Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to talk about what you did in terms of legal advice, I\u2019m asking did you work on the topic.\u201d\n\nAfter a back-and-forth during which Menashi wouldn\u2019t offer any specifics on his work or his personal beliefs, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) told him it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to seek the position if he was going to \u201cstonewall\u201d the committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand if you have any values that are consistent with the awesome responsibilities you are seeking, and I\u2019m hoping you would show some candor and honesty,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nMenashi, 40, a former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., was also criticized by Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) for not providing, in the senator\u2019s view, a thorough answer to a hypothetical question about violent words on social media leading to gun violence.\n\n\u201cCounsel, you\u2019re a really smart guy, but I wish you\u2019d be more forthcoming,\u201d Kennedy told Menashi. \u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to be a game; we\u2019re supposed to try to understand not how you\u2019re going to rule but how you\u2019re going to think.\u201d\n\nMenashi is a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, though he does not have the support of the state\u2019s two Democratic senators, as used to be customary. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said in a joint statement that Menashi\u2019s \u201cviews are far outside the judicial mainstream and completely out of step with the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nMenashi was also questioned by Democrats on his work as acting general counsel in the Education Department under Secretary Betsy DeVos as well as prior controversial writings, including a 2010 law journal article defending \u201cethnonationalism\u201d as a defense for Israel being a \u201cJewish state.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about that particular piece, Menashi said that he was only trying to point out that many \u201cliberal democracies have a linguistic or ethnic basis,\u201d making Israel not out of the ordinary.\n\nMenashi has also been criticized for other controversial writings such as accusing gay rights activists of exploiting the murder of Matthew Shepard and criticizing \u201cTake Back the Night\u201d marches that raise awareness about sexual assault on college campuses.\n\nProtesters stood outside the hearing room yelling, \u201cTitle IX is on the line.\u201d Trump nominated Menashi on Monday, and the Senate Judiciary panel scheduled his confirmation hearing for two days later.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been criticized by Democrats for abandoning Senate practices to quickly shepherd nominees through the confirmation process. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Trump\u2019s 150th judge. Trump has now appointed 105 district judges, 43 circuit court judges and two Supreme Court justices.", "description": "Steven Menashi was also criticized for prior writing, including one article defending \u201cethnonationalism.\u201d", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tKU0QepCUduKtlubJh7aItIRnNg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3AD34GU5MI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
