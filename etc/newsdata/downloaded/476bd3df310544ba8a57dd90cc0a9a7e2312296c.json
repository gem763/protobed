I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe decision also comes one day after a drone attack hit the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry. The Trump administration has pinned the blame on Iran.\n\nIran pushed back hard, calling U.S. accusations \"maximum lies\" and threatening that its forces could strike U.S. military bases in the Middle East. Pompeo issued two tweets blaming Tehran \u2014 without proof \u2014 despite Yemen's Houthi rebels claiming responsibility.\n\nLawmakers, like Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Senator Adam Schiff of California, backed up Pompeo's claims. \"I think Secretary Pompeo's statements yesterday were absolutely right,\" Cheney said. \"I think it's very clear this was the Iranians.\"\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that the Houthis don't have the capability to do a strike like this without Iranian assistance,\" Schiff added.\n\nPrior to Mr. Trump's announcement, the Energy Department said it stood \"ready\" to tap into the strategic petroleum oil reserves if necessary to offset any disruptions.", "description": "\"I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other states,\" the president tweeted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/15/7890897a-4671-4925-abd9-345edae884cb/thumbnail/1200x630/f4d098eab66b737075d2f9d80aefd8c7/rtx73478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
