Froomey, it\u2019s his big goal, he wants to win five.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not going to make a call until at least December training camp, sit down with the team. Obviously, we\u2019ll be chatting to them before that anyway, but maybe make a call around then really.\n\n\u201cEven if I did the Giro, it would still certainly excite me and get me out of bed in the morning.\u201d\n\nThomas previously lead the team then known as Team Sky at the 2017 Giro, but had his hopes of overall victory ended after a crash involving a police motorcycle.\n\nIneos find themselves in the curious position of having the last three Tour de France winners at their disposal.\n\nAnd they may have to deploy all three in combination to ward off the challenge of Team Jumbo-Visma.\n\nRead more\n\nTwenty-one things we learned from the 2019 Tour de France\n\nThe Dutch team have added Tom Dumoulin for next season, meaning they may have two Grand Tour winners in their team for the Tour de France, with 2019 Vuelta a Espana champion Primoz Roglic likely to also be in the mix for the yellow jersey.\n\nJumbo-Visma\u2019s Steven Kruijswijk was Thomas and Bernal\u2019s closest challenger this summer, finishing third.\n\nStory continues\n\nIneos have also strengthened, though, with Richard Carapaz (winner of this year\u2019s Giro) recruited from Movistar.\n\nThomas thinks that a three-pronged attack may be too much, and believes the team should stick with the two leader approach that has served them so well in the last two years.\n\n\u201cI think two does work and has worked for the last two years,\u201d he said.\n\nThomas finished second behind team mate Egan Bernal at this summer's Tour de France (AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAs long as we keep that same philosophy. I\u2019ll look at both the routes and see what motivates me and see what the other guys are thinking as well. And then just go from there.\u201d\n\nIneos could, therefore, conceivably pair Carapaz and Thomas for the Giro and then Froome and Bernal in France.\n\nFroome will make his return from a number of injuries suffered in a crash in June in Japan next month.\n\nThomas is pleased to see his team mate back fit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see him back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoke to him recently. I had a missed call from him yesterday. But it\u2019s great to see him back on the bike, just to be there and racing at Saitama, just to be riding around with those guys.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Twenty-one things we learned from the 2019 Tour de France", "description": "Geraint Thomas is considering riding the Giro d\u2019Italia in 2020 with Team Ineos\u2019 Tour de France plans unclear.The Welshman finished second in this year\u2019s Tour de France after claiming the yellow jersey last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YqhDMXYZ.2SFZ7mlMgReUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fl5Gd..SHqDeGPvLcwfKDA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/6caecbc397ec9fdbfc297a7345c2a18c", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
