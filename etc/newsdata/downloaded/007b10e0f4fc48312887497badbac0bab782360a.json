Williams is the all-time leading rusher in Division 1-A history with 6,279 yards. RC\n\nWilliams sold his trophy to a private collector for an unspecified amount in 2014. That collector, Brian Hobbs, opted to sell it at the annual Heritage Auctions\u2019 Fall Sports Memorabilia Collectibles event Friday.\n\nThe winning bid eclipsed the total of $435,763 paid for Tim Brown\u2019s 1987 trophy last December.\n\nLate Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam\u2019s Heisman Trophy sold for nearly $400,000 in an online auction in January 2018, with proceeds benefiting research into brain injuries, according to published reports.\n\n\u2014Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor became the fourth player in FBS history to rush for 5,000 yards before his senior season, joining Heisman Trophy winners Herschel Walker of Georgia and Ron Dayne of Wisconsin, as well as Oregon\u2019s LaMichael James, with a 16-yard run over left guard on the first play from scrimmage.\n\nTaylor, who rushed for 132 yards and a touchdown in Saturday\u2019s 24-23 loss to Illinois, needed only 736 carries to reach 5,000, the fewest of the four players. He has 5,128, passing James (5,082) and former Badgers back Dayne (5,091). Walker had 5,596 yards.\n\nTaylor, who won the 2018 Doak Walker Award as the nation\u2019s top running back, entered Saturday\u2019s game needing just 4 yards to reach 5,000. He also entered the day needing 145 yards to move past Montee Ball (5,140 yards) and into second place in Wisconsin history behind Dayne (7,125).\n\n\u2014Miami wide receiver Jeff Thomas received a one-game suspension and sat out the game against visiting Georgia Tech, the team announced. According to the school, Thomas was suspended for an unspecified violation of team rules.\n\nThomas\u2019 24 receptions trail only tight end Brevin Jordan on the team, while his 270 yards receiving are third most on the Hurricanes. He has two touchdown catches, tied for the most on the club.\n\nThomas led Miami with 35 receptions and 563 receiving yards in November 2018 before being dismissed from the team for unspecified reasons prior to the regular-season finale. He reportedly contemplated transferring to Illinois before electing to return to the Hurricanes.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Heisman Trophy presented to Texas running back Ricky Williams in 1998 sold at an auction for $504,000, a record for college football's most recognizable award.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442868553&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J027-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
