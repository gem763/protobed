His rivals said they could not trust him not to abuse the power of his office to simply move the election date into November and crash the country out of the European Union while there is no parliament in place to stop him.\n\nHe told the House of Commons that he wouldn\u2019t do it. His official spokesman told reporters that he would never consider such a move.\n\nBut Boris Johnson\u2019s word is not his bond.\n\nThe former journalist (who is also known to have fathered at least five children during two marriages and several affairs) has twice been fired for dishonesty.\n\nHis job at The Times of London was terminated when he fabricated a quote from his godfather Colin Lucas, a historian, to use in a story about Edward II. Sadly for him, the made-up quote contained such an obvious historical error that Lucas was forced to come out and defend his honor, thus costing Johnson his first job.\n\nHe suffered a similar fate once he had entered politics. When tabloid newspapers wrote about his four-year affair with Petronella Wyatt, the daughter of Lord Wyatt, he described the reports as an \u201cinverted pyramid of piffle.\u201d Her family came forward to say it was true and Wyatt had undergone an abortion, leaving Johnson to be sacked by the Conservative Party for lying once again.\n\nA court case examining Johnson\u2019s first controversial move as prime minister prompted further concerns about his honesty. He stated publicly that he was not planning to shut down Parliament in the lead up to the Brexit deadline, and his Downing Street spokesman continued to insist that would not be the case until days before Johnson asked the queen to do just that.\n\nJohnson argued disingenuously that the shutdown was just the traditional prorogation used to separate sessions of Parliament. Prorogation is indeed an annual occurrence but this was to be the longest parliamentary shutdown in 40 years and the first since the aftermath of World War II to be called at a time of constitutional crisis.\n\nEmails handed over to a Scottish court examining the legality of the move showed that Johnson had signed off on the prorogation in mid-August after which officials continued to deny for weeks that it would be implemented.\n\nAfter a humiliating defeat in the House of Commons on Tuesday night when 21 Conservative lawmakers voted to take control of Brexit away from their own prime minister, Johnson called for a new election to be held.\n\nThe opposition parties are refusing to accept this latest gambit until they are certain that Johnson won\u2019t try some kind of procedural maneuver to push through a no deal Brexit. Johnson won the vote by 298 to 56 but that fell well-short of the number required to trigger an election.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said it was impossible to believe Johnson\u2019s assurances because he has been \u201cdishonest time and again\u201d and \u201clied\u201d to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWhen he says the 15th of October, I can tell you across all the opposition parties and some Tory MPs, they do not trust him,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was an \u201celephant trap.\u201d\n\nFor hundreds of years British prime ministers had the power to call an election whenever they wanted. This was often used to try to take advantage of a wave of popularity\u2014such as Theresa May\u2019s ill-fated snap election of 2017\u2014but it also helped to navigate political crises when a government\u2019s legitimacy was being questioned. On the other hand, it was very easy for an election to be triggered by the opposition if the government no longer commanded a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nThat system was curtailed by the Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, who saw a short-term gain in being able to cement his 2010 coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron was also the leader who decided that a referendum on membership of the European Union would be a neat way to end decades of internal Conservative bickering about Europe.\n\nUnder Cameron\u2019s Fixed-Term Parliament\u2019s Act, a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons is required to bring about an early end to a five year term. Johnson has no way of securing that supermajority without the help of his opponents; on Wednesday he fell more than 130 votes short, giving him his third defeat out of three votes in his short prime ministerial career.\n\nJohnson made a \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment to get Britain out of the EU by October 31 even if that meant triggering a No Deal Brexit, which would mean Britain had no trade deals with Europe and would be likely to suffer economic harm in the short term at least.\n\nOn Wednesday, the rebels who defeated Johnson the night before returned to the Commons and backed a bill to block a No Deal Brexit if the prime minister hasn\u2019t agreed a plan with the EU ahead of the October 31 deadline. It will now pass to the second chamber, the House of Lords, for expected approval.\n\nThe bill could have been derailed by some fresh apparent duplicity from the prime minister. An unpopular amendment to it unexpectedly passed after the government reportedly refused to provide staff to count any of the votes against it. However, the opposition lawmakers and Conservative rebels were undeterred and passed the bill with a 29-strong majority.\n\nUnable to push through No Deal, or call an election and hope that a fed-up nation would agree to get this over with, Johnson is now left with nowhere to turn in the short term. He responded to the bill passing by formally challenging Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back his call for a general election next month, but as things stand the measure doesn\u2019t have the required two-thirds approval of the House of Commons.\n\nLabour is split on when to acquiesce to an election, but they know that forcing Johnson to break his Halloween pledge would be a boon to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which waits in the wings, poised to steal millions of Conservative votes whenever the country does go back to the polls.\n\nDespite that chance to make Johnson go back on his word, Corbyn is still minded to go to the people as soon as possible in the belief that a strong campaign would see him installed into No 10. He's been calling for an election ever since the last one, and appeared rankled earlier when Johnson mocked him as a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d for not rushing to back a vote.\n\nIf only he could convince the rest of his skeptical and largely anti-Brexit party that Johnson would be as good as his word.", "description": "Opposition parties deal Boris Johnson another blow as they refuse to grant him the power to call an election because they don\u2019t trust him to stick to his word.", "authors": ["Nico Hines", "London Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567623405/190904-hines-boris-tease_wbkvsp"}
