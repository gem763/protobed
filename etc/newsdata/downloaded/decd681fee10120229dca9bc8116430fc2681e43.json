That's how we'll win in 2020,\" Yang said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption A.J. Chavar for NPR A.J. Chavar for NPR\n\nOn the subject of winning, King pushed Yang on whether he can actually secure the Democratic nomination.\n\n\"Are you running for president to win?\" King asked, \"Or are you running for president to introduce ideas into the conversation?\"\n\nIn response, Yang struck a confident tone.\n\n\"I 100% can win,\" he said. \"I'm running to solve the biggest problems of our time.\"\n\nYang has never run for public office and was a relative unknown before he launched his Oval Office bid. He has managed to breakthrough a crowded Democratic field with a sobering message that new technologies are already responsible for killing millions of American jobs.\n\nHis signature proposal of a universal basic income, which his campaign calls a \"freedom dividend,\" would give every American adult $1,000 a month, no strings attached. Yang says he would pay for it by consolidating certain welfare programs and implementing a 10% tax on the goods and services that businesses produce.\n\nA universal basic income is necessary, Yang argues, to mitigate \"an unprecedented crisis\" of wide-scale job losses due to automation.\n\nKing pointed to the fact that Yang is garnering single digits in presidential preference surveys.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption A.J. Chavar for NPR A.J. Chavar for NPR\n\nAccording to Real Clear Politics, Yang is polling at roughly 2%, putting him slightly ahead of other presidential hopefuls, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and about even with former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke.\n\nBut he lags far behind top-tier candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nKing floated the possibility of Yang serving in different ways \u2014 Commerce Secretary, perhaps. He was non-committal, but left the door open.\n\n\"I'm open to contributing in any of a range of roles,\" Yang said.\n\nThe interview took place in New York City's Flatiron District, roughly two miles away from Trump Tower, at a dim sum restaurant Yang selected called Baodega.\n\nAs the American-born son of Taiwanese immigrants, Yang's Asian heritage is central to his campaign, something he reflected on during the interview.\n\n\"It's given me a lot of joy and pride to think about an Asian child turning on the Democratic debates and seeing me up on that stage,\" Yang said. \"Hopefully it gives them a sense that we're just as American as anyone else.\"\n\nOn the campaign trial, Yang has received criticism for playing up Asian stereotypes, which has produced mixed reactions from Asian Americans, as a recent Vox report detailed. In one debate, he said that \"The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.\"\n\nYang has taken a jaunty approach to campaigning, including, at times donning a blue and white hat with \"MATH\" on it \u2014 an acronym for \"Make America Think Harder.\" It's a tongue-in-cheek play on President Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again,\" and has been a hit with his followers.\n\nHis most devoted supporters even have a moniker \u2014 the Yang Gang.", "description": "Yang says Democrats need to articulate a vision for the country. \"When we're talking about Donald Trump, we are losing to Donald Trump, even if it's in the context of talking about impeaching him.\"", "authors": ["Brakkton Booker"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/19/2019-10-19-andrew-yang-chavar-10_wide-7fe058fcaff71364d4c83656378a313b42f12d2c.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
