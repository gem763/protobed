Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.\n\nA pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers \u2014 stovetop and electric \u2014 are quite safe. They don\u2019t explode as your grandmother\u2019s may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.\n\nFor a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, they\u2019re heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pot\u2019s temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isn\u2019t hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.\n\nWith an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cook\u2019s having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And don\u2019t worry: It won\u2019t explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.", "description": "Whether you\u2019re hungry for perfect chickpeas from dried beans, succulent roasts in a fraction of the time, or a comforting soup ready when you walk in the door, a multicooker, which can act as electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer and even yogurt-maker, can help. The Instant Pot is the best known of the multicookers now on the market, though other manufacturers, like Breville and Fagor, make models. We\u2019ll show you how to master them, with valuable techniques for getting the most out of the machine.
