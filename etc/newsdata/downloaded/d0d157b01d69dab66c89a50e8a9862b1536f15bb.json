Biden, President Trump\u2019s former adviser Stephen K. Bannon asserted Monday.\n\nMr. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, claimed during a television interview that Mrs. Clinton could emerge as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re prepared to sacrifice a rook to take down a king,\u201d Mr. Bannon said on the Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cPrimetime\u201d program. \u201cThey will throw Biden away, right? They will throw Biden away to get to Trump and hope Elizabeth Warren, or I even think Hillary Clinton or [Michael] Bloomberg or some centrist comes in here.\u201d\n\nPressed by \u201cPrimetime\u201d host Trish Regan, Mr. Bannon cited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s recent comments critical of Mr. Trump and \u201ca whole thing on media\u201d she has planned in support of her new book released Tuesday, \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s running,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to decide how to fit her way in.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton, 71, unsuccessfully ran for the White House as a Democrat in both 2008 and 2016, and she has previously ruled out running a third time in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running, but I\u2019m going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in March.\n\nMore recently, Mrs. Clinton slammed Mr. Trump in an interview on CBS that aired Sunday, calling him an \u201cillegitimate president.\u201d\n\nRecent nationwide polling has placed Mr. Biden, the former vice president, and Ms. Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, as front-runners in a crowded pool of presidential hopefuls. Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, said in March that he will not run for the White House in 2020.\n\nMr. Bannon, 65, served as chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential election campaign during the 2016 race against Mrs. Clinton. He subsequently served as the president\u2019s chief strategist prior to leaving the White House in August 2017.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
