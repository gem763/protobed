According to Gelernter and Rosenthal, the new social media platform will return control of personal data to individuals who could share it or sell to others if they prefer instead of sharing data to existing social media platforms that sell users\u2019 information to advertisers by default.\n\nBlockchain benefits for Revolution Populi\n\nSpeaking with Business Insider, Rosenthal highlighted blockchain\u2019s decentralized nature as a primary benefit in enabling a decentralized database:\n\n\"First of all, it's decentralized. You can create a decentralized database that's owned and governed and controlled by nobody except for the users. It can be democratically governed and it is a way to quit that ownership that those two companies have over people's lives.\"\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs exec and Revolution Populi\u2019s co-founder elaborated that the implementation of smart contracts will allow people to control access to their data and let them earn money for sharing that data instead of granting this right to social media platforms such as Facebook.\n\nICO and native crypto are also planned\n\nIn addition to implementing blockchain in Revolution Populi, Gelernter and Rosenthal also plan to conduct an initial coin offering in the coming months for the cryptocurrency that will run on the platform, the report notes. While software for the social network is still being developed, Rosenthal expressed hope that the project will be completed in early 2020.\n\nIn late September, a subsidiary of Argentinian smart contract platform RSK purchased Latin America\u2019s social media giant Taringa, gaining exposure to 30 million users.", "description": "Mirror Worlds creator David Gelernter and 19-year Goldman Sachs veteran Rob Rosenthal team up for a new social network", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kN2RmYjJmN2MxMTk1NzM3ZWVmM2ZmMTc5MDljN2FjOS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
