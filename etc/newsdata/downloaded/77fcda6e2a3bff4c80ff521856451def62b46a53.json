(Picture: Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images)\n\nFrom its conception, roller derby has been all about breaking boundaries of gender expectations.\n\nThe sport has a real sense of empowerment, tenacity and endurance and is also without a doubt one of the most inclusive sports in the world.\n\nSo when a journalist wrote last week about how roller derby has been ruined and is \u2018no longer an exclusively female sport\u2019, it\u2019s no surprise the roller derby community wasn\u2019t having any of it, hitting back in full support of trans and intersex people.\n\nEveryone is welcome, regardless of their background, which has fostered an environment where queer, gender-non conforming and trans athletes actually feel comfortable and can enjoy sport without judgement.\n\nI used to play sports to a very serious degree when I was younger, and have about 30 different medals from long-distance running, sprint running, long-jumping and other related areas. I also trained with a football team, and played basketball and volleyball in my free time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I transitioned I removed myself from sport altogether, out of fear that I wouldn\u2019t be welcome anywhere, and so I lost out on the social and physical advantages sports can give you.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever played sports can testify to the benefits and joy of it; the rush of setting off as the sprint starts, the adrenaline kick of scoring a goal or the competitive atmosphere. To suddenly lose out on all of these things can be very difficult, which is why it\u2019s so important for all sport to be inclusive.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t play roller derby myself, I have many friends, both trans and not trans, who do.\n\nYou can keep your hands off roller derby (Photo: Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images)\n\nFor many, it\u2019s been a place where they can practice sport without fear of discrimination or exclusion. It\u2019s been a life-changer for them. Roller derby allows disenfranchised people to nurture their athletic abilities, something that has incredible effects on people\u2019s mental and physical well-being.\n\nWhile the topic of sport in the UK in terms of trans and intersex inclusion continues to be a contentious one, the roller derby community is a great example to how to do things right and not get stuck in poorly based arguments around alleged \u2018competitive advantages\u2019.\n\nGender segregation is often used as a blanket excuse to exclude trans and intersex women, based on normative and often western ideas about women\u2019s bodies, much like we\u2019ve seen with Caster Semenya and her ongoing battle to continue competing as the woman she is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers sports have a lot to learn from roller derby \u2013 both the Women\u2019s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) and the UK Roller Derby Association (UKRDA) are fully inclusive of trans and intersex athletes, and allow them to compete in the categories that most closely correspond with their identity, regardless of their assigned gender.\n\nThese organisations\u2019 commitment to creating a safe environment for queer athletes to compete is commendable, and has certainly not ruined \u2018an exclusively female\u2019 sport or caused trans and intersex women to dominate the sport.\n\nOn the contrary, it\u2019s enriched the community, making it one of the most beautiful representations of sport where outdated, fundamentalist and normative ideas about gender and bodies are scrapped, and the spirit of the sport is celebrated above all else.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like that, you can keep your hands off roller derby.\n\nMORE: Cancel culture can be toxic in the trans community\n\nMORE: Queer women don\u2019t feel safe so I\u2019ve created a London nightclub just for us\n\nMORE: The importance of trans people telling our own stories in TV like Pose cannot be understated\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Owl writes about why roller derby is such an inclusive sport and how it brings together people from different backgrounds.", "authors": ["Writer", "Co-Director Of My Genderation", "Advisor For All About Trans"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-914365962_1570614387.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
