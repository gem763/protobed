General Assembly in New York, Johnson said: \u201cThe Conservative Party is the oldest, most successful political party in the world, and we will be contesting the next election when the opposition finally summon up the nerve to have an election. We will be contesting the next election as Conservatives and not in an alliance or a pact or a coupon procedure.\u201d\n\nAsked if his party would contest every seat in the country, he added: \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nHe was also told that Farage said in a newspaper interview that the pair get on well, to which the prime minister replied: \"God.\" He added: \u201cI have personally good relations with all sorts of political opponents, which is one of the glories of British political culture.\"\n\nJohnson tried to call an election earlier this month but opposition MPs blocked his bid in the House of Commons, saying they would not support it until the October 31 Brexit date had been delayed.\n\nPolling suggests the Conservatives could be at risk in an election if the Brexit Party syphons off some of its vote while the pro-Remain parties club together to avoid splitting their support in anti-Brexit seats.\n\nThe Brexit Party hopes to win big in northern seats held by the opposition Labour Party, which voted for Brexit in large numbers at the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nFarage made a plea to Johnson earlier this month, saying: \u201cIf you have the courage for a clean-break Brexit, then we will help you secure a big Brexit majority. Together we can destroy [Jeremy] Corbyn\u2019s Labour.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "The Brexit Party has called on the Conservatives to stand down in dozens of seats.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Rym Momtaz", "David M.
