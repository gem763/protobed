They claimed they were making a statement about oil & gas that they intend to have mentioned during the Democrat presidential debate being held this evening.\n\nOne intrepid and not-at-all mousy protestor from the organization sent out a tweet early this morning from their staging area at the port.\n\nBREAKING: We're in Houston shutting down the largest oil export channel in the country to resist Trump & the oil industry for fueling this #ClimateCrisis. It's time to end the age of oil. #PeopleVsOil pic.twitter.com/iFfDuz5dQY \u2014 Greenpeace USA (@greenpeaceusa) September 12, 2019\n\n(Now that you are done laughing)\n\nIt is bad enough that these climate-gripers are showing obliviousness, but to do so with layers of ignorance is all the more impressive.\n\nWhere to begin? Well, how about with what our 80lb warrior here is wearing to their protest?\n\nThose must be hemp glasses. \u2014 Federalist Musket\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Patriot_Musket) September 12, 2019\n\nYeaaaaaa\u2026maybe when lecturing us on the evils of petroleum, maybe adorning yourself entirely in products made from the vile substance is a bad look.\n\nAlexa, what are hard hats made from? \u2014 Busy procrastinating (@floating_spoon) September 12, 2019\n\nPetroleum? You\u2019re soaking in it. \u2014 Lulu Lapin (@Lulu_Lapin) September 12, 2019\n\nHow do you think that helmet and those glasses were made? \u2014 William (@LastWordWilliam) September 12, 2019\n\nEverything in this photo, from the safety helmet, to the glasses, lenses, to the camera used to take the picture, were produced from oil. And unless you rode to Houston on a horse, oil got you there too. Hypocritical dorks. \u2014 Jags Movie Guy (@MoviePaul) September 12, 2019\n\nPlastic hard hat. Plastic rimmed glasses. Plastic reflective vest.\n\nPlastic between the ears. \u2014 \u26a1\ufe0fErick Brockway\u26a1\ufe0f (@erickbrockway) September 12, 2019\n\nDid you tweet this from a smartphone? Made with plastic? \u2014 \ud83d\udc27K Penguin Knees \ud83d\udc27 (@KneesPenguin) September 12, 2019\n\nJacket, glasses, hard hat, shirt, shoes are all from OIL. Jesus \u2013 even the device you took a picture with is comprised mostly of petroleum. Did you know that twitter uses oil and coal by housing servers in an air conditioned building and that most servers are comprised of OIL. \u2014 Suzie (@sioxielegend) September 12, 2019\n\nYour facts are killing the planet, Man!\n\nNext question, of course, would also be one of inconvenience. It sounds noble to want to eradicate the use of oil and gasoline \u2014 but then what will we as a planet be transitioning towards using, exactly??? If \u201cIt\u2019s time to end the age of oil\u201c, then there must be an alternative at the ready that people are just clamoring to get, correct?\n\nYeah I really hate how oil makes my car run, or planes fly, or how it reduces medical waste, makes phones and computers, roads, EVERYTHING YOU'RE WEARING \u2026 \u2014 Leigh \ud83d\ude3c\ud83c\udf77\ud83e\udd43\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Hammock_Cat) September 12, 2019\n\nHer future world powered without oil\u2026 pic.twitter.com/LDjH9jxP7j \u2014 Dare to Offend (@atlharp) September 12, 2019\n\nI'm just going to leave this here\u2026https://t.co/mTWD9GuaiM \u2014 AllieC (@Malbec987) September 12, 2019\n\nThe same people are against nuclear, too. smh \u2014 Monika (@MonikaMusing) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cEnd the age of oil\u201d by ushering in the age of coal fired steam \u2014 BitterApplesauce (@bitterclinger4e) September 12, 2019\n\nSlowing down traffic and increasing fuel consumption to own the oil industry. \u2014 Kyle Beckley (@Kyle_Beckley) September 12, 2019\n\nWhich brings us lastly, given the nefarious nature of oil and gasoline, to ask one last question. What method of transportation did these noble energy knights use to travel to Houston, and to arrive on site?\n\nWondering how they got to Houston in the first place. \u2014 Alex Jeffries \ud83d\udd25 (@the1codemonkey) September 12, 2019\n\nDid you guys walk there? \u2014 Regs (@r3gulations) September 12, 2019\n\nHow'd you get to Houston exactly? Hot air ballon? \u2014 eric (@eriContrarian) September 12, 2019\n\nWell, we cannot expect them to remain consistent and actually follow the very policies they want to force onto others, can we?!?! They are saving the planet! That kind of work is too important to then be expected to adhere to their own message!!!\n\nThey are achieving a noble result!\n\nWhite privilege is dangling from a bridge to protest the industry that makes the products that keep you from falling to your death while dangling from a bridge. \u2014 S.
