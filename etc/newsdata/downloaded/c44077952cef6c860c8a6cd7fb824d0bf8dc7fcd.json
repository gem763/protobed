I\u2019m out tonight for a simple reason. You don\u2019t shoot a teenager at point blank range,\u201d said Alex Chan, an interior designer at a protest in the shopping district of Causeway Bay.\n\n\u201cThese protests will continue and we won\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrations have stretched the police force and transport networks to their limits.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp closed stations in districts including Po Lam, Hang Hau and Tseung Kwan O just before midnight on Wednesday as the violence picked up. All affected stations reopened on Thursday.\n\nEMERGENCY LAW\n\nThe protests began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have evolved into calls for democracy, among other demands.\n\nThe opposition to the Beijing-backed government has plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades and poses the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power.\n\nPeople take part in a students' demonstration on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in solidarity with the student protester who was shot by a police officer on October 1, the CUHK students who were arrested in anti-government protests, and the pro-democracy movement, in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China, October 3, 2019.

When facing such a series of massive rioting incidents, we cannot work alone - clapping only with one hand - without appropriate measures and support from top level,\u201d Lam said.\n\nThe public has become increasingly hostile towards police amid accusations of heavy-handed tactics. Police say they have shown restraint.\n\nThe lawyer for an Indonesian journalist injured when police fired a projectile during protests on Sunday said she had been blinded in one eye.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe European Union said in a statement it was deeply troubled by the escalation of violence and the only way forward was through \u201crestraint, de-escalation and dialogue\u201d.\n\nThe city\u2019s tourism board announced the cancellation of a major cycling tournament, the Hong Kong Cyclothon, and the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, citing \u201cunforeseen circumstances in the coming weeks\u201d.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.", "description": "The lawyer for an 18-year-old Hong Kong student protester shot in the chest by police was due to appear in court on his behalf on Thursday, after the teenager was charged over his role in violent demonstrations.", "authors": ["Donny Kwok", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436552410&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920GN"}
