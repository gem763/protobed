Mahienour El-Masry, an Egyptian activist and human rights lawyer, as well as journalists and students, were among those arrested, the statement said. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in central Cairo and several cities on Sept. 20 against Sisi.\n\nThe protests stemmed from calls for President Sisi to resign by Mohamed Ali, a former army contractor, who accused al-Sisi and the military of corruption.\n\nIn New York, a group of about 60 Egyptian Americans gathered Sunday in support of the anti-Sisi rallies in Egypt. The demonstrators were chanting loudly and boisterously for Sisi to resign outside the New York hotel where the Egyptian president is currently staying, the Middle East Eye (MEE) noted. Sisi is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this week.\n\nDalia Wassef, an Egyptian American protest organizer, told MEE.\n\nWe are Egyptians from all walks of life. We are not part of any organization. This was just a spontaneous grouping of people. We are here to protest against Sisi\u2019s brutal, corrupt regime and call for democracy in Egypt.\n\nEchoing Wassef, a different protester who identified himself only as Ali, told MEE that it was vital for Egyptians to \u201ccome together and work towards getting rid of this guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether you are Islamist or liberal, we all have to get rid of him. He has no legitimacy,\u201d Ali added.\n\nIn 2013, then Egypt\u2019s military chief Sisi led the military\u2019s overthrow that toppled the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected president, following protests against his rule. Sisi has been ruling Egypt as the president since.\n\nFor the first time since Sisi officially took power in 2014, tear gas was fired to disperse protestors in Egypt over the weekend. The incident marked some of the first demonstrations since the former minister of defense, and subsequent military chief Sisi took power 2014.\n\nLast Friday, hundreds of Egyptians filled Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square \u2013 a vital site of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution \u2014 demanding that Sisi step down. Demonstrations spread to other parts of Egypt. Allegations of corruption against the Sisi administration triggered the protests.\n\nThe embattled president dismissed the allegations as \u201clies and slander,\u201d BBC reports.\n\nUnder his tenure, Sisi has dealt with jihadis like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in the Sinai with a heavy hand. BBC, however, reports that \u201che has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people.\u201d\n\nThe British news outlet added:\n\nEgyptians voted to approve constitutional changes in April that could extend Mr Sisi\u2019s term in office until 2030, on a turnout of 44%. He won 97% of the vote in 2018\u2019s presidential election when he faced no serious opposition.\n\nOn Monday, Sisi is reportedly expected to meet U.S. President Donald Trump for bilateral talks at U.N. headquarters.", "description": "Authorities arrested more than 350 since protests against President Abdel-Fattah\u00a0al-Sisi\u00a0accused of corruption began Friday.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/egypt-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
