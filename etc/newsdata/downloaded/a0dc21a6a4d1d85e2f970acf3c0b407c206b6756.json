Reigning NBA champion Toronto holds its media day on Saturday.\n\nThose teams were permitted to open training camps earlier than most because of the league\u2019s rule allowing those clubs going overseas for preseason games to get some additional preparation time.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have media day on Sunday because they\u2019re headed to Hawaii for training camp. The remaining 23 teams have them scheduled for Monday.\n\nThe first preseason game is Monday, with the Rockets playing host to the Shanghai Sharks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "LeBron James is expected to speak about a season of great expectations for himself and the new-look Los Angeles Lakers, as the annual rundown of media days get underway around the NBA.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/nba_tariffs_basketball_82972_c0-107-2554-1596_s1770x1032.jpg?5d8ded0a198302c45130a505bd28f2b50340ea2d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
