That undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.5% drop.\n\nThe reading for June was revised up to an increase of 2.7 from a previously reported 2.5% increase.\n\n\"Overall, new orders in the manufacturing sector had a weak start to the third quarter,\" the ministry said.\n\n\"In light of still unresolved international trade conflicts and muted business expectations in manufacturing, there are still no signs of a fundamental improvement in the industrial sector in the coming months,\" the ministry added.\n\nOrders from non-euro zone countries plunged nearly 7% on the month while demand from other euro zone countries and domestic bookings rose slightly, the data showed.\n\nWithout the distorting effects of bulk orders, industrial orders rose 0.5% on the month in July, the ministry added.\n\n\"The misery in manufacturing continues. The decline in new orders significantly increases the risk of a recession for the German economy,\" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.\n\nThe German economy contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the drop in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain.\n\n\"The danger is great that negative growth will also be recorded in the third quarter,\" Gitzel added.", "description": "Recession risks rise for Germany as industrial orders plunge", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF840G2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
