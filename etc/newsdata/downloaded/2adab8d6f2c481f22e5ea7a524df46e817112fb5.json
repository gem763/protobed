For the part it can control, the U.S.-led coalition should work with Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq to reinforce their borders and ensure that no escaped ISIS fighters or family members are able to cross. With the small presence remaining at Syria\u2019s al-Tanf Garrison as well as other bases in the region, the U.S. can still use its intelligence assets along the Iraq-Syria, Jordan-Syria, and Turkey-Syria borders to monitor ISIS movements. The U.S. will also need to maintain its battlefield communications channel with Russia, the Syrian government\u2019s ally, to ensure that, when necessary, it has the ability to strike ISIS or extremist targets from Syrian airspace.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made clear that Turkey and other countries now bear the responsibility for the detention of ISIS fighters, but with the regime likely coming into the greater northeast at large\u2014not just towns affected by the offensive\u2014it is probable that a mixture of SDF and regime security forces will continue the security of camps and prison facilities. Both will need to keep dangerous ISIS fighters off the battlefield, as well as work to facilitate aid access into encampments\u2014something that will remain difficult as many aid groups are often unwilling to enter regime territory.", "description": "", "authors": ["Votel", "Theatlantic.Com International Archive Turkey-Kurds-Syria-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
