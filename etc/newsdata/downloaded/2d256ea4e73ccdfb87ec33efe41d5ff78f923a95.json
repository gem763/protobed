Known as Siamraptor suwati, the apex predator is estimated to be more than 26-feet long and weighed at least 3.5 tons, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Moreover, the phylogenetic analyses revealed that Siamraptor is a basal taxon of Carcharodontosauria, involving a new sight of the paleobiogeographical context of this group,\" the study's abstract reads. \"Siamraptor is the best preserved carcharodontosaurian theropod in Southeast Asia, and it sheds new light on the early evolutionary history of Carcharodontosauria.\"\n\nT.
