Her stepfather told authorities she had failed to come home after going out in Anchorage the previous evening.\n\nOn Tuesday, 62-year-old Donald McQuade, of Gresham, Ore., was arrested and charged with first- and second-degree murder.\n\nYELLOW SOCKS LEAD TO PENNSYLVANIA MAN'S ARREST IN 1991 COLD CASE MURDER OF GIRLFRIEND, POLICE SAY\n\n\u201cI was really flabbergasted,\u201d Shelley\u2019s mother, Judy Connolly, said after being told of the cold-case arrest. \"I'd never thought I'd see this day in my lifetime.\"\n\nThe night the teen disappeared, she went to a local bar called Chilkoot Charlie\u2019s and then to a diner, according to KTUU-TV. Witnesses said she was talking to three young men in the bar, but authorities failed to identify any of them.\n\nAn autopsy found that she'd been sexually assaulted, beaten and thrown down the embankment. Her liver had been lacerated by blunt-force trauma. She tried climbing back up the embankment before she succumbed, breaking all her fingernails in the process, her mother said.\n\nSEX OFFENDER INDICTED IN 1988 TEXAS COLD CASE MURDER\n\nDecades later, troopers developed a DNA profile from swabs collected from the victim's body. But they failed to get a match. Earlier this year, troopers turned to genetic genealogy testing, which looks at a DNA profile against known profiles of people in genealogical databases to find people who share common genetic information.\n\n\u201cThis guy was never on the radar,\u201d said cold-case investigator Randy McPherron, who added that McQuade was ultimately identified through one of three brothers. Standard DNA testing by Gresham police on two cigarette butts that the suspect discarded in public confirmed that McQuade matched the DNA profile.\n\nMcQuade has denied having anything to do with the murder, but an arrest affidavit asserts that he confided to a longtime friend that he made many mistakes when he was drunk, KTUU reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDonald McQuade's older brother, Richard, told KGW that he believes his brother is innocent.\n\n\"I have my own belief which I can't substantiate, but I know my brother,\" Richard McQuade was quoted as saying. \"And if anything, he might've been in the car, not at the time the crime was committed.\"\n\n\"I can only hope it turns out well,\" he said, \"and they give my brother and our family a big apology.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The case\u00a0of an Alaska\u00a0teenager who was beaten, raped and dragged from a moving car has been\u00a0solved using DNA and genetic genealogy, authorities said Thursday.", "authors": ["Robert Gearty"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Alaskacoldcase720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
