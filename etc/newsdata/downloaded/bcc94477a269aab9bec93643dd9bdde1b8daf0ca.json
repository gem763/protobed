He tells us about his newfound love of woodworking, a creative pursuit which goes against the grain of the typical corporate lifestyle.\n\nHow did your interest in woodwork begin?\n\nI liked it at high school, then forgot about it. About six years ago I went to an exhibition and saw a flyer for classes at Richard Crosland School of Fine Woodwork and thought this\u2019ll be good for me to do after work. I rang up expecting to do it straight away and was told there was a six-month wait list. Some months later I was offered a slot from six til nine on a Tuesday night.\n\nMerrick Howes: \u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful surprise. I was looking for something mentally stimulating and creative as a change of pace.\u201d Renee Nowytarger\n\nHow is the class run?\n\nIt\u2019s in a workshop out near the airport, with eight people per class. You buy the wood and get it delivered. All the tools are provided, and you get as much or as little help from Richard as you want. People make everything from bed-heads to guitars, jewellery boxes, chairs, tables and chess boards. Anything you\u2019ve seen in wood.\n\nWere you nervous at first?\n\nDefinitely and I certainly made more mistakes. But there\u2019s a reasonable amount of common sense involved. I\u2019ve made things that are quite simple and things that are very complex with varying degrees of help. Most challenging was a coffee table shaped like a flower that\u2019s got inlay and various timbers. I like using a mix of dark and light.\n\nPreferred wood?\n\nOak, wenge, Macassar, blackwood and maple. I have a property in the Blue Mountains with oaks and blackwood. When they come down, I\u2019ve had them planked and then stack them up to dry for a few years.", "description": "Hedge fund manager Merrick Howes went back to school to pursue his interest in woodwork.
